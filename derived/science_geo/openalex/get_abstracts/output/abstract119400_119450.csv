https://openalex.org/W2075167383,"The crystal structure of the ternary porcine lipase-colipase-tetra ethylene glycol monooctyl ether (TGME) complex has been determined at 2.8 Å resolution. The crystals belong to the cubic space group F23 with a = 289.1 Å and display a strong pseudo-symmetry corresponding to a P23 lattice. Unexpectedly, the crystalline two-domain lipase is found in its open configuration. This indicates that in the presence of colipase, pure micelles of the nonionic detergent TGME are able to activate the enzyme; a process that includes the movement of an N-terminal domain loop (the flap). The effects of TGME and colipase have been confirmed by chemical modification of the active site serine residue using diisopropyl p-nitrophenylphosphate (E600). In addition, the presence of a TGME molecule tightly bound to the active site pocket shows that TGME acts as a substrate analog, thus possibly explaining the inhibitory effect of this nonionic detergent on emulsified substrate hydrolysis at submicellar concentrations. A comparison of the lipase-colipase interactions between our porcine complex and the human-porcine complex (van Tilbeurgh, H., Egloff, M.-P., Martinez, C., Rugani, N., Verger, R., and Cambillau, C. (1993) Nature 362, 814-820) indicates that except for one salt bridge interaction, they are conserved. Analysis of the superimposed complexes shows a 5.4° rotation on the relative position of the N-terminal domains excepting the flap that moves in a concerted fashion with the C-terminal domain. This flexibility may be important for the binding of the complex to the water-lipid interface.

This flexibility may be important for the binding of the complex to the water-lipid interface. Pancreatic lipase (triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, EC) plays a key role in dietary fat absorption in the intestine. It converts insoluble long chain triglycerides into more polar molecules that are able to cross the brush border membrane of enterocytes as mixed micelles with bile salts. Besides their role in triglyceride digestion through lipid emulsification and intestinal fat absorption, bile salts exert a strong inhibitory effect by preventing lipase adsorption through coating of the water-lipid interface (1Borgström B. Erlanson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 60-68Google Scholar). Lipase adsorption is a fundamental process because the enzyme catalyzes a heterogeneous reaction that involves an interfacial activation step. To counteract the inhibitory effect of bile salts, the pancreas secretes a small protein, colipase (molecular mass, 10 kDa), which anchors lipase to the bile salt-coated water-lipid interface in their presence (2Chapus C. Sari H. Sémériva M. Desnuelle P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 155-158Google Scholar, 3Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. Rathé S. Christophe J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 49: 334-337Google Scholar). Thus, lipolysis results from the combined effect of pancreatic lipase, colipase, and bile salts. Pancreatic lipase is a single polypeptide chain of 50 kDa. This protein has been characterized in several species, and the amino acid sequences of the enzyme from pig, man, horse, rabbit, rat, guinea pig, and coypu (4De Caro J. Boudouard M. Bonicel J.

The localization and role of these related lipases is not clear. Crystal structures of the human (17Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Google Scholar, 18van Tilbeurgh H.

Biol. 1994; 238: 709-732Google Scholar) lipases have shown that the polypeptide chain is divided into two domains bearing specific functions. The N-terminal domain contains the catalytic triad (Ser152-His263-Asp176) and is responsible for triglyceride hydrolysis. The C-terminal domain is involved in colipase binding as initially established from biochemical data (20Mahe-Gouhier N. Léger C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 962: 91-97Google Scholar, 21Abousalham A. Chaillan C. Kerfelec B. Foglizzo E. Chapus C.

Nature. 1992; 359: 159-162Google Scholar, 22van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.-P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Google Scholar, 23Egloff M.P. Marguet F. Buono G.

It is known from amino acid sequence comparisons that colipases in general constitute a highly homologous family (10Thirstrup K. Carrière F. Hjorth S.A. Rasmussen P.B. Nielsen P.F. Ladefoged C. Thim L. Boel E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 186-193Google Scholar, 25Charles M. Erlanson C. Bianchetta J. Joffre J. Guidoni A. Rovery M. Biochim. Biophys.

L., Kumar, V. B., (1992) Genbank L-06329.Google Scholar). These proteins posses two topologically distinct sites, an interfacial binding site involving the tyrosine-rich region of the molecule (30Granon S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 54-60Google Scholar) and a lipase binding site containing polar residues (31Erlanson C. Barrowman J.A. Borgström B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 489: 150-162Google Scholar, 32Chaillan C. Rogalska E. Chapus C. Lombardo D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 443-446Google Scholar). The crystal structure of porcine colipase complexed to human lipase (18van Tilbeurgh H. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1992; 359: 159-162Google Scholar, 22van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.-P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Google Scholar, 23Egloff M.P. Marguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2751-2762Google Scholar) showed that the polypeptide chain forms four fingers protruding from a compact core held together by a network of five invariant disulfide bridges. The interfacial binding site appears to be located at the tips of the fingers, whereas the lipase binding site is on the opposite side of the molecule. A specific feature of pancreatic lipase, when compared with other classical serine hydrolases, is that the catalytic site is inaccessible to substrate in solution. A structural basis for this inaccessibility has been obtained from the crystal structures of human lipase (17Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Google Scholar, 18van Tilbeurgh H. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1992; 359: 159-162Google Scholar) and the porcine colipase-human lipase complex (22van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.-P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Google Scholar, 23Egloff M.P. Marguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2751-2762Google Scholar). These studies have shown that in the former structure, the enzyme adopts an inactive, closed conformation with a surface loop from the N-terminal domain (the flap) covering the active site, and that in the latter lipase has an active open conformation resulting from the repositioning of the flap (22van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.-P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Google Scholar). The motion of the flap makes the active site accessible to the substrate, simultaneously forming a functional oxyanion hole and generating the lipase interfacial binding site. So far, the open conformation has only been observed when lipase was co-crystallized with colipase and either bile salt/phospholipid (22van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.-P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Google Scholar) or βoG/C11 1The abbreviations used are: βoGoctyl-β-D-glucopyranosideNaTDCtaurodeoxycholic acid sodium saltTGMEtetraethylene glycol monooctyl etherE600diisopropyl p-nitrophenylphosphater.m.s.root mean squareMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. alkylphosphonate mixed micelles (24Egloff M.P.

Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the porcine lipase-colipase complex. From this structure we conclude that the presence of both pure nonionic detergent micelles and colipase induces the activation of lipase in the absence of substrate. This observation has been confirmed by biochemical experiments based on the reactivity of the catalytic serine residue to E600. The presence of a TGME molecule bound to the active site pocket may provide an explanation for the inhibitory effect of submicellar concentrations of nonionic detergents on emulsified triglyceride hydrolysis. In addition, a comparison of our natural complex to the human porcine complex has allowed us to 1) define a set of lipase-colipase interactions that are likely to be conserved among the various species and 2) provide a possible explanation for the existence of an unnatural salt bridge in the human-porcine complex. Finally, through superposition studies of the human-porcine and porcine complexes, we conclude that the lipase-colipase complex is composed of two more or less rigid regions connected by a hinge: one of the regions is formed by the N-terminal domain excluding the flap, and the other is formed by by C-terminal domain, colipase, and the flap. Both proteins were purified from a delipidated acetonic pancreatic powder. The two isolipases (LA and LB) were purified according to the method of Lombardo et al. (33Lombardo D. Chapus C. Bourne Y. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 259-261Google Scholar). Porcine colipase was purified according to Chapus et al. (34Chapus C. Desnuelle P. Foglizzo E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 99-105Google Scholar). Lipase activity was titrimetrically determined at pH 7.5 and 25°C using 0.11 M emulsified triacylbutyrylglycerol (tributyrin) in 1 mM Tris/HCl buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2. Under these conditions, the specific activity of purified lipase is 8000 units/mg. One unit corresponds to the release of 1.0 µmol of fatty acid/min. The inhibition experiments were performed in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl. Porcine lipase, either alone or in the presence of detergent and/or porcine colipase was treated with 4 mM E600. The mixture was incubated at 25°C, and aliquots were withdrawn from the mixture at various time intervals. The remaining lipase activity was measured as mentioned above. The porcine lipase-colipase complex was crystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method (35Mc Pherson A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 112-120Google Scholar) at 20°C. Typically, a stock complex solution was prepared by mixing 10 µl of lipase and 7 µl of colipase solutions at 10 mg/ml each corresponding to a 1:3 molar ratio of lipase to colipase. A total of 12 different nonionic detergents were screened in crystallization experiments using ammonium sulfate as the precipitating agent. Suitable crystals were obtained by mixing 2 µl of complex solution with 2 µl of a reservoir solution containing 50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 0.5 M ammonium sulfate, and 15 mM TGME. Under these conditions, TGME is essential for crystallization. Preliminary x-ray data were collected at room temperature on a Xentronics/Siemens X-1000 area detector diffractometer coupled to a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode x-ray generator equipped with a graphite monochromator and a 3 × 0.3 mm2 focal spot size. Data to 4.0 Å resolution were processed with the XENGEN software package (36Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Ohlendorf D.H. Salemme F.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 383-387Google Scholar) in the cubic space group P23, with a = 144.6 Å and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. A second diffraction data set was collected with a synchrotron radiation source (LURE, W32 station) on a MAR-Research image plate system. Inspection of diffraction images using MOSFLM (37Leslie A.G.W. Helliwell J.H. Machin P.A. Papiz M.Z. Computational Aspects of Protein Crystal Data Analysis. 1987: 39-50Google Scholar) indicated that indexing using the space group P23 predicted only half of the reflections present in the diffraction pattern. The unaccounted for reflections were in general much weaker, revealing a strong P23 pseudo-symmetry. Re-indexation of the diffraction spots using the space group F23 (a = 289.1 Å) predicted all the observed reflections and allowed for the integration of the data. The porcine lipase-colipase complex corresponds to the first macromolecular crystal structure ever reported in F23. The crystals have a Vm of 4.3 Å3/D, which corresponds to approximately 70% solvent (38Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Google Scholar). A total of 42,501 unique reflections with F > 0.0, corresponding to 86% of all data expected at 2.8 Å resolution, were scaled with the CCP4 crystallographic package (39CCP4 The S.E.R.C. (U.K.) Collaborative Computing Project No. 4, A Suite of Programs for Protein Crystallography. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington WA4 4AD, UK1979Google Scholar). The relatively low internal consistency of the data (Rsym = 0.13, defined as ΣI(i) −⟨I⟩/ΣI(i)) is due to the systematically weak intensities (mean I/σ(I) = 3.4) resulting from the P23 pseudo-symmetry. AMoRe, an integrated computer program package of molecular replacement programs (40Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1994; 50 (and references therein): 157-163Google Scholar), was used to solve the structure of the porcine complex applying the horse lipase structure (19Bourne Y. Martinez C. Kerfelec B. Lombardo D. Chapus C. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 709-732Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code HPL) as the search model. Rotation and translation searches, carried out using a 4-12 Å resolution range, led to unique independent solutions for the two molecules of the asymmetric unit. The positions of these molecules were then refined in the same resolution range with the rigid body option of AMoRe (41Castellano E. Olivia G. Navaza J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 281-284Google Scholar). The resulting R-factor and the correlation value were 0.34 and 0.77, respectively. Amino acid sequence changes were incorporated with the program O (42Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar) running on an ESV/20 (Evans & Sutherland, Utah, USA) computer graphics system. The partial model was initially refined using the simulated annealing and the energy minimization protocols of X-PLOR (43Brünger A.T. Isaac N.W. Taylor M.R. Crystallographic Computing 4: Techniques and Technologies. Clarendon Press, Oxford1988: 126Google Scholar), followed by periodic inspections of electron density maps. Subsequently, the Cys238-Cys262 segment and the loop comprising residues 77-86 were manually rebuilt. At this stage, inspection of the (Fo− Fc) electron density map around the C-terminal domain of both crystallographically independent lipases revealed strong features that were assigned to the colipase molecules. Subsequently, the three-dimensional model of colipase (23, Protein Data Bank entry 1LPB) was manually positioned in this electron density in an orientation that corresponded approximately to the one observed for the human-porcine complex (22van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.-P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Google Scholar). Based on the electron density map, two extra residues were added to the N-terminal region of colipase. Next, the lipase model was completed with a five sugar moeity connected to Asn167, a TGME molecule in the active site and a putative mercaptoethanolate bound to Cys182. This model, to which water molecules were progressively added, was then refined with X-PLOR using noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. The crystallographic R-factor converged at a value of 0.21 for reflections between 6 and 2.8 Å resolution (Table I). The final model contains 8356 nonhydrogen protein atoms, two Ca2+ ions, 422 water molecules, two TGME molecules, two mercaptoethanolates, four N-acetylglucosamine, and six mannose residues and has good stereochemistry. The two complex molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis. This axis is shifted by 2 Å in the a direction and 1 Å in the c direction relative to the position it would occupy as a crystallographic axis in the space group P23, thus explaining the pseudo-symmetry observed (see above). Superposition of the two molecules of the asymmetric unit leads to an r.m.s. deviation of 0.5 Å on the Cα positions. Because they are very similar, only molecule A will be used in the following discussion. The final coordinates have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank and will be released one year after publication (Protein Data Bank access code 1ETH).Table I.Final model and refinement statisticsResolution limits (Å)6-2.8Final R-factoraR-factor=(ΣhFo−Fc)/ΣhFo0.21Final free R-factor (56van Tilbeurgh H.

Erlanson C. Bianchette J. Joffre J. Guidoni A. Rovery M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 359: 186-197Google Scholar) contained some errors. Inspection of the electron density map unambiguously revealed that positions 30, 31, and 32 corresponded to Trp, Ser, and Pro, respectively (Fig. 1). The presence of these residues has been confirmed by protein sequencing. 2J. Bonicel, personal communication. Thus, the previously reported sequence Pro29-Pro30-Asp31-Lys32 has been now replaced by Pro29-Trp30-Ser31-Pro32-Lys33, and the numbering of the complete chain has been adjusted to account for the inserted residue. In order to compare the results presented here with previously reported analyses, their numbering schemes should be shifted by adding one to residues past position 31. The porcine lipase is a two-domain structure. The N-terminal domain is of the α/β type; it comprises residues 1-336 and contains the catalytic Ser153, Asp177, and His264. The C-terminal domain is a β-sandwich (45Chothia C. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3955-3965Google Scholar); it contains residues 337-449 and is responsible for most of the contacts with colipase. The overall structure of porcine lipase (Fig. 2) closely resembles those of the corresponding uncomplexed human (17Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Google Scholar) and horse (19Bourne Y. Martinez C. Kerfelec B. Lombardo D. Chapus C. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 709-732Google Scholar) enzymes. The major difference is due to the conformation of the flap because a surface helix blocks the access to the catalytic triad in the latter two lipases. In the porcine complex reported here, lipase has an open conformation that is similar to the one described for the human-porcine complex (22van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.-P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Google Scholar): the Cys238-Cys262 segment protrudes from the catalytic N-terminal domain and the 77-86 loop folds back onto the protein surface. In the course of the refinement, (Fo− Fc) maps displayed a high electron density peak close to the Glu188-Asp196 loop. Based on previous reports (17Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Google Scholar, 19Bourne Y. Martinez C. Kerfelec B. Lombardo D. Chapus C. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 709-732Google Scholar), we assigned this peak to a Ca2+ ion that in our case, interacts with the highly conserved Glu188, Arg191, Asp193, and Asp196, forming a distorted square pyramid. The Ca2+ site, located far from the catalytic triad, is not likely to be directly involved in catalysis, and it appears to play a purely structural role in the loop. Both porcine and human lipases are N-glycosylated at Asn167 (46Garner C.W. Smith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 561-565Google Scholar, 47De Caro A. Figarella C. Amic J. Michel R. Guy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 411-419Google Scholar). In the former, two isolipases A and B have been described differing both in the length (10 or 11 residues) (48Fournet B. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. De Caro J. Rovery M. van Kuik A. Vliegenthart F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 369-371Google Scholar) and in the branching organization of their glycan moieties (49Plummer T.H. Sarda L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7865-7869Google Scholar). Two N-acetylglucosamines and three mannose (Man1-3) residues could be built into the corresponding electron density. From these studies, the crystalline porcine lipase was assigned unambiguously to isoform B, for which the carbohydrate chain bifurcates after the third sugar residue (Man1) into two distinct segments (Man2 and Man3) (50Benkouka F. Guidoni A. De Caro J. Bonicel J. Desnuelle P. Rovery M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 331-341Google Scholar). The disulfide bridge pattern originally described for human lipase (17Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Google Scholar) is conserved in the porcine enzyme. A possible disulfide bridge interchange between Cys91, Cys102, and Cys104 described for this enzyme (49Plummer T.H. Sarda L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7865-7869Google Scholar) is not supported by our data: the free thiol group of Cys104 is located 3.5 Å away from the Sγ atoms of the Cys91-Cys102 disulfide bond (not shown). Porcine lipase has been reported to contain one free thiol group that is reactive toward sulfhydryl reagents (51Verger R. Sarda L. Desnuelle P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 242: 580-592Google Scholar); our structural results assign this reactivity to Cys182, which we have modelled as a Cys residue modified by reaction with a β-mercaptoethanol molecule (see “Experimental Procedures”). Colipase is a flattened molecule that contains a cysteine-rich core and four hydrophobic fingers comprising segments 14-24, 27-39, 47-64,and 68-90. Its structure is very similar to the one described by Egloff et al. (23Egloff M.P. Marguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2751-2762Google Scholar), although it seems to be slightly better ordered, because two additional N-terminal amino acids are seen in the electron density map. Despite the lack of regular secondary structure, colipase has an averaged temperature factor of 29.2 Å2, which is similar to the one obtained for lipase (27.0 Å2). The B factors reach a maximum of 35.0 Å2 at the tips of the four fingers, reflecting the higher mobility of this region. Porcine lipase and colipase interact through 8 polar, 17 van der Waals, and 4 water-mediated contacts (Tables II, III, and IV). Five of the polar contacts occur between colipase and the lipase C-terminal domain and the remaining three link colipase to the flap. These interactions are conserved in the human-porcine complex (22van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.-P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Google Scholar, 23Egloff M.P. Marguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2751-2762Google Scholar), and according to amino acid comparisons they should be common to all lipase-colipase complexes. The only major difference between the two complexes at the lipase-colipase interface is the salt bridge between Arg44 of porcine colipase and Asp390 of human lipase, which is absent from the natural porcine complex (Fig. 3).Table IILipase-colipase polar interactionsLipaseColipaseDistances (Å)Asn241 NGlu15 Oε23.05Ser244 OγLeu16 N3.05Val247 OArg38 NH13.33Asn366 Nδ2Glu45 O3.32Gln369 NGlu64 Oε12.76Gln369 Nε2Arg65 O3.09Lys400 NzGlu45 Oε22.73Lys400 NzAsn89 Oδ13.19 Open table in a new tab Table IIIWaters bridging interactionsLipaseDistance (Å)WaterDistances (Å)ColipaseAsn366 O2.6Wat292.6Arg44 NH1Asn366 N2.8Wat292.8Arg44 NH2Gln369 O3.11Wat502.8Glu64 Oε2Gln369 Oε13.14Wat613.7Arg65 N Open table in a new tab Table IVvan der Waals contactsLipaseColipaseDistances (Å)Ser244 CβGlu15 Cα3.74Leu243 Cδ1Leu16 Cδ23.84Ile249 Cγ2Arg38 Cδ3.9Ile249 Cγ2Arg38 CZ3.26Phe361 Cε2Glu45 Cδ3.56Phe361 CζGlu45 Cδ3.65Gln369 CδGlu64 Cβ3.85Gln369 CγGlu64 Cδ3.72Glu440 CγArg65 Cγ3.57Ile402 Cδ1Arg65 CZ3.49Tyr404 CγArg65 CZ3.78Tyr404 Cδ2Arg65 CZ3.27Tyr404 Cε2Arg65 Cγ3.63Ile402 Cδ1Arg65 C3.65Ile402 Cδ1Gly66 Cα3.65Leu442 CβAsn89 Cγ3.64Leu442 Cδ1Asn89 Cγ3.67 Open table in a new tab In order to determine the relative orientations of the N- and C-terminal domains of lipase in the porcine and human-porcine complexes, we carried out partial superposition studies. For the C-terminal domains of the two lipases the superposition resulted in an r.m.s. deviation of 0.58 Å in Cα positions for these regions (Fig. 4). The resulting orientations of the flap region and colipase were also very similar, with Cα r.m.s. deviations of 0.7 Å. In contrast, the positions of the N-terminal domains, excluding the flap region, were quite different, with r.m.s. deviations of 2.24 Å in the Cα positions. When the superposition of the two complexes was based on the N-terminal domains, a Cα r.m.s. deviation of 0.6 Å was obtained for these regions, indicating that they have very similar structures. The r.m.s. deviations of 2.24 Å in the Cα positions, observed in the first superposition, result from a 5.4° rotation of the N-terminal domain, excluding the flap, around residues Ser334 and Asn335. These two residues present highly significant differences in the ϕ and Ψ torsion angle values between the porcine and human-porcine complexes (Δϕ = −46.23° and ΔΨ = −115.33° for Ser334 and Δϕ = 166.57° and ΔΨ = 57° for Asn335). We conclude from these studies th"

It has been demonstrated that the mutations result in constitutive activation of the Ret protein, leading to transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. In the present study we investigated the role of tyrosine residues present in the carboxyl-terminal sequence for the transforming activity of Ret with the MEN 2A or MEN 2B mutation (MEN2A-Ret or MEN2B-Ret). Substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine 1062 (designated Y1062F) markedly impaired the transforming activity of both MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret, whereas substitution or deletion for four other tyrosines (codons 981, 1015, 1090, and 1096) did not affect their activity. The Shc adaptor proteins bound to the MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret proteins and were phosphorylated on tyrosine in the transfectants. The binding of Shc to the Y1062F mutant proteins was reduced by approximately 80%, indicating that tyrosine 1062 is a major binding site for Shc. In addition, phosphopeptide analysis of MEN2A-Ret demonstrated that tyrosine 1062 represents an autophosphorylation site of the mutant Ret proteins.

MEN 2A, MEN 2B, and FMTC are dominantly inherited neoplastic disorders, the former two of share the clinical feature of medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. FMTC is characterized by the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma alone. Hirschsprung's disease represents a congenital disorder associated with the absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the distal gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies demonstrated that MEN 2A, MEN 2B, and FMTC mutations represent gain-of-function mutations (10Takahashi M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1995; 6: 35-46Google Scholar, 11Asai N. Iwashita T.

MEN 2A mutations that involve cysteine residues present in the extracellular domain induce ligand-independent dimerization of the Ret protein, leading to its constitutive activation (10Takahashi M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1995; 6: 35-46Google Scholar, 11Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Google Scholar, 12Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romano A. Bottaro D.P.

In contrast, the MEN 2B mutation detected in the kinase domain of Ret appears to activate the Ret protein without dimerization, probably due to a conformational change of its catalytic core region (12Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romano A. Bottaro D.P. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Matoskova B. Kraus M.H. Di Fiore P.P. Science. 1995; 267: 381-383Google Scholar, 14Iwashita T. Asai N. Murakami H.

In addition, we found that tyrosine residues in the kinase domain essential for transforming activity are different between Ret with the MEN 2A mutation (MEN2A-Ret) and Ret with the MEN 2B mutation (MEN2B-Ret) (14Iwashita T. Asai N. Murakami H. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 481-487Google Scholar). Substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine 905 completely abolished the transforming activity of MEN2A-Ret but not MEN2B-Ret. This tyrosine corresponds to tyrosine 416 of the Src protein and is known to be conserved in all tyrosine kinases and play crucial roles in their catalytic and/or biological activities (16Kmiecik T.E.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2359-2366Google Scholar). Since the activation of MEN2A-Ret could mimic that of other receptor tyrosine kinases caused by the ligand-dependent dimerization, phosphorylation of tyrosine 905 may be important for the activity of MEN2A-Ret. On the other hand, tyrosines 864 and 952, instead of tyrosine 905, were required for the activity of MEN2B-Ret but not MEN2A-Ret, supporting the view that the MEN 2B mutation induces a conformational change of the Ret kinase domain. Tyrosine 905 and tyrosines 864 and 952 appeared to regulate the tyrosine kinase activity of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret, respectively (14Iwashita T. Asai N. Murakami H. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 481-487Google Scholar). To date, the intracellular signaling pathways via the Ret protein have not been well characterized, because a ligand for Ret is still unknown. Tyrosine residues present in the carboxyl-terminal sequence of receptor tyrosine kinases are known to be the sites recognized by various signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains such as phospholipase C type γ, Ras GTPase-activating protein, Grb2, and Shc (23Songyong Z.

In the present study, to characterize the signaling pathways via the mutant Ret protein, we mutated tyrosines present mostly in the carboxyl-terminal sequence of Ret. Among five tyrosines examined (tyrosines 981, 1015, 1062, 1090, and 1096), replacement of tyrosine 1062 with phenylalanine drastically decreased the transforming activity of both MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret. In addition, we found that tyrosine 1062 is a major binding site for the Shc adaptor proteins that are phosphorylated on tyrosine in the transfectants. A cDNA clone containing the entire coding sequence (for 1072 or 1114 amino acids) of the human c-ret gene was inserted between HindIII and EcoRI sites of the Rc/CMV plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Each mutation was introduced by polymerase chain reaction. In brief, primers containing the mutations were synthesized and used for amplification of c-ret sequences of approximately 100-150 base pairs. The corresponding sequences of the c-ret gene were replaced with the amplified fragments with the mutations. The amplified fragments were sequenced to confirm that proper mutations were introduced. Each recombinant plasmid (0.05-0.2 µg) was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells (5 × 105 cells in a 60 mm-diameter dish) with 10 µg of NIH 3T3 DNA as described previously (1Takahashi M. Buma Y. Iwamoto T. Inaguma Y. Ikeda H. Hiai H. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 571-578Google Scholar). Transformed foci were scored on day 12 after transfection. Then foci were picked up and grown into cell lines. Total cell lysates were prepared from NIH 3T3 cells and transfectants as described previously (26Takahashi M. Buma Y. Taniguchi M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 297-301Google Scholar). The lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Nihon Millipore Kogyo KK, Tokyo, Japan). After membranes were reacted with anti-Ret antibody (26Takahashi M. Buma Y. Taniguchi M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 297-301Google Scholar, 27Takahashi M. Asai N. Iwashita T. Isomura T. Miyazaki K. Matsuyama M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2925-2929Google Scholar), anti-Shc antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA), the reaction was examined by the avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method (26Takahashi M. Buma Y. Taniguchi M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 297-301Google Scholar) or 125I-protein A (ICN, Irvine, CA). A cDNA fragment with or without the Y1062F mutation comprising nucleotides 3075-3714 (numbered according to the published sequence (2Takahashi M. Buma Y. Hiai H. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 805-806Google Scholar)) was inserted between StuI and PstI sites of pMAL™-c expression vector (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Epicurian Coli TKX1 competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that contain a plasmid-encoded, inducible tyrosine kinase gene. To express the fusion proteins, transformed cells were grown in 2 × YTG broth (16 g of tryptone/liter, 10 g of NaCl/liter, and 10 g of yeast extract/liter) containing 2% (w/v) glucose, 50 µg/ml ampicillin and 12.5 µg/ml tetracycline, and the induction was performed with 0.3 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside when the cultures reached A600 = 1-2. The cells were spun down at 2,000 × g and resuspended in TK induction media (see manufacturer's (Stratagene) protocol) to an A600 of 0.5. They were then grown for 2 h at 37°C to phosphorylate the fusion proteins. Phosphorylation of the fusion proteins was evaluated by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Induced bacteria were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the MBP-Ret fusion proteins were purified using the amylose resin. NIH 3T3 cells (approximately 1 × 107) were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate, and clarified lysates were incubated with 1 µg of immobilized MBP-Ret fusion proteins at 4°C overnight. The protein complexes were washed four times with RIPA buffer and eluted in SDS-sample buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 10% sucrose, 20 µg/ml bromphenol blue) by boiling for 3 min. Then protein complexes were subjected to Western blotting with anti-Shc antibody. Cells were labeled for 4-5 h in phosphate-free RPMI medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml; ICN) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 1 h, incubated with Sepharose beads conjugated with antibodies at 4°C overnight, and washed with RIPA buffer four times. The resulting antigen-antibody complex was suspended in SDS-sample buffer in the presence of 80 mM dithiothreitol and boiled for 3 min. Immunoprecipitated phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel, and the 175-kDa Ret band was excised. The gel pieces were suspended in 70% formic acid containing 10 mg/ml cyanogen bromide (CNBr) and incubated at room temperature overnight. After lyophilization, digested samples were subjected to Tricine/SDS-16.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (28Schagger H.J. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar), and a 6-kDa phosphorylated fragment, which was expected to contain amino acids 1010-1064 (Fig. 4A) and reacted with anti-Ret antibody generated against 19 amino acids with tyrosine 1062 (27Takahashi M. Asai N. Iwashita T. Isomura T. Miyazaki K. Matsuyama M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2925-2929Google Scholar), was excised. The gel pieces then were digested with tolyl sulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin, oxidized with performic acid, and lyophilized as described (29Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Google Scholar). Tryptic digests were resolved by electrophoresis at pH 8.9 for 1 h at 600 V, followed by ascending chromatography (butanol-1/pyridine/acetic acid/H2O, 75:50:15:60). A peptide comprising amino acids 1058-1078 of the long isoform of Ret (Fig. 4A) was synthesized. Five µg of peptide was mixed with the product of the Ret intracellular domain (amino acids 682-1114) with the MEN 2B mutation expressed in baculovirus and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (10 µCi, 6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham, United Kingdom) in the kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MnCl2, and 0.01% Triton X-100) for 20 min at 30°C. Phosphorylated peptide was separated on Tricine/SDS-16.5% polyacrylamide gels, and the peptide band was excised, digested with CNBr, and lyophilized as described above. Then peptides were digested with trypsin and separated in two dimensions. We introduced the MEN 2A (Cys634-Arg, C634R) or MEN 2B (Met918-Thr, M918T) mutation into two Ret isoforms of 1114 amino acids (long isoform) and 1072 amino acids (short isoform) (Fig. 1) and investigated their transforming activity. The 51 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the long isoform were replaced by the 9 unrelated amino acids of the short isoform by alternative splicing in the 3′ region (30Tahira T. Ishizaka Y. Itoh F. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 97-102Google Scholar). The former sequence contains an additional two tyrosines (tyrosines 1090 and 1096) as compared with the latter sequence (Fig. 1). The mutant ret cDNAs were inserted into the expression vector containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Table I, the transforming activity of the long isoform with the MEN 2A mutation was 1.5-fold higher than that of its short isoform. On the other hand, the activity of the long isoform with the MEN 2B mutation was approximately 10-fold higher than that of the short isoform with the MEN 2B mutation and 2-3-fold higher than that of both isoforms with the MEN 2A mutation. Since the transfection efficiencies of each construct (5-6 × 106 G418-resistant colonies/µg of DNA) were comparable, these results suggested that the carboxyl-terminal sequences of two isoforms differently regulate the activity of the mutant Ret proteins.Table I.Transforming activity of the mutant ret genesDNAFocus-forming activity (foci/µg of DNA)aTransformed foci were counted on day 12after transfection.No. of Scid mice with tumor formation/total number of Scid micebNIH 3T3 cells (3×106) expressing each construct were subcutaneously injected in female Scid mice.

Open table in a new tab To investigate whether the length of the carboxyl-terminal sequence influences the activity of Ret with the MEN 2A or MEN 2B mutation (MEN2A-Ret or MEN2B-Ret), we truncated the long isoform after codon 1074 (designated DEL-1074). This truncation removed tyrosines 1090 and 1096 present in the long isoform. However, the truncation did not significantly affect the transforming activity of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret (Table I). Since the length of the carboxyl-terminal tail in the DEL-1074 mutant protein was comparable with that of the short isoform, the low transforming activity of the short isoform of MEN2B-Ret appears to be caused by its specific carboxyl-terminal sequence. In addition, this result indicated that tyrosines 1090 and 1096 do not play a crucial role for the transforming activity of the long isoform of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret. We next replaced tyrosines 1015 and 1062 in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the long isoform as well as tyrosine 981 in the kinase domain with phenylalanine (Fig. 1; designated Y1015F, Y1062F, and Y981F, respectively). Although another tyrosine (codon 1029) was present in the carboxyl-terminal sequence, substitution for this tyrosine has been unsuccessful in our experiments. Among these, replacement of tyrosine 981 or tyrosine 1015 did not affect the transforming activity of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret. In contrast, substitution for tyrosine 1062 severely impaired the activity of both of them (Table I), suggesting that tyrosine 1062 is one of major sites recognized by signaling molecules important for their transforming activity. In order to analyze the role of tyrosine residues in the intracellular signaling via the Ret protein, we established the cell lines expressing each mutant Ret protein at high levels (Fig. 2A). As expected, molecular mass of the short isoform and the DEL-1074 mutant protein (150 and 170 kDa) was approximately 5 kDa smaller than that of the long isoform (155 and 175 kDa). The cell lines expressing MEN2A-Ret with the Y1062F mutation or MEN2B-Ret with the Y1062F mutation (designated NIHret(C634R,Y1062F)L and NIHret(M918T,Y1062F)L cells) showed a partially transformed phenotype, whereas other cell lines expressing the Y981F, Y1015F, or DEL-1074 mutant proteins were spindle-shaped and highly refractile. The cells expressing the short isoform of MEN2B-Ret also showed a fully transformed phenotype. When these cells were injected subcutaneously into Scid mice, all of them formed solid tumors, although the latency of NIHret(C634R,Y1062F)L and NIHret(M918T,Y1062F)L cells was longer (15-21 days) than that of the other cell lines (6-7 days) (Table I). Fig. 2B shows Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation are similar among the cell lines expressing each isoform of MEN2A-Ret or MEN2B-Ret or expressing the Y981F, Y1015F, or DEL-1074 mutant proteins. As we have already reported (11Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Google Scholar, 14Iwashita T. Asai N. Murakami H. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 481-487Google Scholar), the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 170-175-kDa Ret proteins present on the cell surface was higher than that of the 150-155-kDa Ret proteins present in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, several other proteins including 74-, 58-, and 50-kDa proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine at variable levels in each transfectant. On the other hand, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation somewhat decreased in NIH(C634R,Y1062F)L and NIH(M918T,Y1062F)L cells (Fig. 2B), although the Y1062F mutation did not influence the autokinase activity of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret in vitro (data not shown). Since Borrello et al. (31Borrello M.G. Pelicci G. Arighi E. De Filippis L. Greco A. Bongarzone I. Rizzetti M.G. Pelicci P.G. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1661-1668Google Scholar) reported that two forms of rearranged Ret (Ret/ptc1 and Ret/ptc2) found in human papillary thyroid carcinoma bound the Shc proteins in vivo, we investigated whether the MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret proteins also bind Shc. After the lysates from NIHret(C634R)L, NIHret(M918T)L, NIHret(C634R,Y1062F)L, and NIHret(M918T,Y1062F)L cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ret antibody, they were immunoblotted with the anti-Ret or anti-Shc antibody (Fig. 3A). As a result, it turned out that the 52- and 46-kDa Shc proteins were coprecipitated with the MEN2A-Ret or MEN2B-Ret protein. Interestingly, the degree of binding of Shc to MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret with the Y1062F mutation markedly decreased (∼80%). Since the Y981F, Y1015F and DEL-1074 mutant proteins did not show a significant change of the binding ability for Shc as compared with that of the MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret proteins (data not shown), the results suggested that tyrosine 1062 of Ret represents a major binding site for Shc and that its binding is associated with the transforming activity of the mutant Ret proteins. We next examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc proteins. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Shc or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, the 52- and 46-kDa Shc proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine in NIHret(C634R)L and NIHret(M918T)L cells, whereas the content of tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was significantly reduced in NIHret(C634R,Y1062F)L and NIHret(M918T,Y1062F)L cells, consistent with the decrease of the binding level of Shc to the Y1062F mutant protein. The amount of the Shc proteins immunoprecipitated from NIHret(C634R)L cells was small because of the low cell density in the culture dishes used in this experiment. To confirm that tyrosine 1062 is a binding site for Shc, we synthesized a fusion protein consisting of maltose-binding protein (MBP) and carboxyl-terminal 139 amino acids of the long isoform which include tyrosines 981, 1015, 1029, 1062, 1090, and 1096. A cDNA fragment with or without the Y1062F mutation comprising nucleotides 3075-3714 (numbered according to the published sequence (2Takahashi M. Buma Y. Hiai H. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 805-806Google Scholar)) was inserted into pMAL™-c expression vector. In order to obtain tyrosine-phosphorylated fusion proteins, Epicurian Coli TKX1 competent cells that contain a plasmid-encoded, inducible tyrosine kinase gene were used for transformation, and the induced phosphorylated fusion proteins (approximately 57 kDa) were purified by mixing with the amylose resin (Fig. 3C, left panel). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the fusion proteins was evaluated by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 3C, right panel). Then the fusion proteins with or without the Y1062F mutation bound to the amylose resin were incubated with the lysate from NIH 3T3 cells. After the resin was extensively washed, protein complexes were subjected to Western blotting with anti-Shc antibody. As shown in Fig. 3D, the phosphorylated wild type fusion protein bound the Shc proteins, whereas the content of Shc binding to the fusion protein with the Y1062F mutation markedly decreased. These results confirmed that tyrosine 1062 is required for binding of Shc to the mutant Ret protein. In vivo phosphorylation of the MEN2A-Ret protein was analyzed by immunoprecipitating the lysates of 32P-metabolically labeled NIHret(C634R)L and NIHret(C634R,Y1062F)L cells with anti-Ret antibody. After the 175-kDa Ret protein was eluted from the gel and digested with cyanogen bromide (CNBr), it was separated on Tricine/SDS-16.5% polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). A 6-kDa phosphorylated band that was able to be detected by anti-Ret antibody against the 19 amino acids with tyrosine 1062 (27Takahashi M. Asai N. Iwashita T. Isomura T. Miyazaki K. Matsuyama M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2925-2929Google Scholar) was recovered from the gel (Fig. 4B, lane 3), digested with trypsin, and analyzed in two dimensions on thin layer plates (Fig. 4, C and D). According to this protocol, it was expected to obtain a fragment with tyrosine 1062 but not with other tyrosines (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, spot b was specifically identified in the peptide sample derived from NIHret(C634R) cells but not from NIHret(C634R,Y1062F) cells. To verify that this spot represents a fragment containing tyrosine 1062, we synthesized a peptide of 21 amino acids containing tyrosine 1062 (amino acids 1058-1078 of the long isoform) (Fig. 4A). The synthetic peptide was then phosphorylated in vitro by the product of the Ret intracellular domain with the MEN 2B mutation expressed in baculovirus (Fig. 4B, lane 4), digested with CNBr and trypsin, and separated in two dimensions (Fig. 4E). As a result, a spot produced by digests of this synthetic peptide overlapped with spot b (Fig. 4, D-F), suggesting that spot b represents a peptide containing tyrosine 1062 that was autophosphorylated in vivo. In the present study, we first compared the transforming activity of two Ret isoforms that differ in their carboxyl-terminal sequence. The carboxyl-terminal 9 amino acids of the short isoform were replaced by the 51 amino acids of the long isoform that contains two additional tyrosine residues (Tyr1090 and Tyr1096) (1Takahashi M. Buma Y. Iwamoto T. Inaguma Y. Ikeda H. Hiai H. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 571-578Google Scholar, 2Takahashi M. Buma Y. Hiai H. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 805-806Google Scholar, 30Tahira T. Ishizaka Y. Itoh F. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 97-102Google Scholar). Although the difference in the transforming activity between both isoforms of MEN2A-Ret was small, the activity of the short isoform of MEN2B-Ret was approximately 10-fold lower than that of its long isoform and 3-4-fold lower than that of both isoforms of MEN2A-Ret. These results were in agreement with the results reported by Borrello et al. (13Borrello M.G. Smith D.P. Pasini B. Bongarzone I. Greco A. Lorenzo M.J. Arighi E. Miranda C. Eng C. Alberti L. Bocciardi R. Mondellini P. Scopsi L. Romeo G. Ponder B.A.J. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2419-2427Google Scholar) demonstrating the low transforming activity of the short isoform of MEN2B-Ret. Since most, but not all, transfectants that we isolated showed relatively low levels of expression of the short isoform of MEN2B-Ret in comparison with the expression levels of its long isoform (data not shown), the former protein may be more unstable than the latter. On the other hand, it is possible that the short isoform of MEN2A-Ret might be stabilized by its dimerization, resulting in higher transforming activity than that of the short isoform of MEN2B-Ret. To examine whether the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the long isoform with tyrosines 1090 and 1096 plays a role in the transforming activity, we truncated its 41 carboxyl-terminal amino acids (DEL-1074). However, this truncation did not decrease the transforming activity of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret. This result suggested that the low transforming activity of the short isoform of MEN2B-Ret was caused by its specific carboxyl-terminal sequence rather than by its short length. Since deletion of tyrosines 1090 and 1096 did not affect the activity of the long isoform of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret, we changed three other tyrosines (tyrosines 981, 1015, and 1062) to phenylalanine. Among these, replacement of tyrosine 1062 severely impaired the transforming activity of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret, indicating that tyrosine 1062 represents a major binding site for signaling molecules responsible for cell transformation. Consistent with this view, the degree of binding of the Shc adaptor proteins to the MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret proteins decreased to about 20% in the presence of the Y1062F mutation in vivo as well as in vitro. Simultaneously, phosphopeptide analysis demonstrated that tyrosine 1062 represents an autophosphorylation site of the MEN2A-Ret protein. Thus, it seems likely that the Shc proteins recognize phosphorylated tyrosine 1062 and transmit the signal of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret. In this respect, it has recently been reported that substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine 1062 abolished the mitogenic activity of Ret/ptc2, a rearranged form of Ret detected in human papillary thyroid carcinoma (32Durick K. Yao V.J. Borrello M.G. Bongarzone I. Pierotti M.A. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24642-24645Google Scholar). On the other hand, replacement of tyrosine 1029, the biological role of which was not examined in our experiments, had no significant effect on the mitogenic activity. Furthermore, Borrello et al. (31Borrello M.G. Pelicci G. Arighi E. De Filippis L. Greco A. Bongarzone I. Rizzetti M.G. Pelicci P.G. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1661-1668Google Scholar) observed that two forms of rearranged Ret (Ret/ptc1 and Ret/ptc2) bound the Shc proteins in the transfectants. These also supported our results that tyrosine 1062 is a binding site for Shc that may play a crucial role in the transforming activity of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret. Using the established cell lines expressing each mutant protein, we are currently investigating the signaling pathway via the Shc adaptor proteins responsible for cell transformation. Shc contains two domains, SH2 domain and phosphotyrosine binding domain (33Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Google Scholar), both of which are known to recognize specific phosphotyrosine-containing sequences (34Kavanaugh W.M. Turck C.W. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 1177-1179Google Scholar, 35Songyong Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Google Scholar). The binding specificity of Shc SH2 and phosphotyrosine binding domains is determined by residues carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal to phosphotyrosine, respectively. The sequence (NKL) amino-terminal to tyrosine 1062 of Ret matches the consensus sequence (NXXpY) for the binding of the Shc phosphotyrosine binding domain (34Kavanaugh W.M. Turck C.W. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 1177-1179Google Scholar), whereas tyrosine 1062 is not embedded in the consensus sequence (pY(I/E/Y)X(I/L/M)) for the binding of the Shc SH2 domain (35Songyong Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Google Scholar). This finding suggested that tyrosine 1062 is the target to which the phosphotyrosine binding domain binds rather than the SH2 domain. In addition, since the sequence (GMS) carboxyl-terminal to this tyrosine does not match the consensus sequences for the SH2 domains of other signaling molecules including phospholipase C type γ, Grb2, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Syp and Src family (23Songyong Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that tyrosine 1062 is a major binding site for these molecules. The fact that the Y1062F mutation did not completely abolish the transforming activity of MEN2A-Ret and MEN2B-Ret and their binding ability to Shc suggested that tyrosine residues other than tyrosine 1062 represent minor binding sites for Shc which may be necessary for low levels of their transforming activity. To elucidate other binding sites for Shc, further investigation including the introduction of double or triple mutations of the tyrosines present in the intracellular domain of Ret will be required.

One important question that remains to be clarified is how the apparently non-concentrative system bo,+-like, associated with rBAT expression, participates in the active renal reabsorption of these amino acids. Several studies have demonstrated exchange of amino acids induced by rBAT in Xenopus oocytes. Here we offer evidence that system bo,+-like is an obligatory amino acid exchanger in oocytes and in the “renal proximal tubular” cell line OK. System bo,+-like showed a 1:1 stoichiometry of exchange, and the hetero-exchange dibasic (inward) with neutral (outward) amino acids were favored in oocytes. Obligatory exchange of amino acids via system bo,+-like fully explained the amino acid-induced current in rBAT-injected oocytes. Exchange via system bo,+-like is coupled enough to ensure a specific accumulation of substrates until the complete replacement of the internal oocyte substrates. Due to structural and functional analogies of the cell surface antigen 4F2hc to rBAT, we tested for amino acid exchange via system y+L-like. 4F2hc-injected oocytes accumulated substrates to a level higher than CAT1-injected oocytes (i.e. oocytes expressing system y+) and showed exchange of amino acids with the substrate specificity of system y+L and L-leucine-induced outward currents in the absence of extracellular sodium. In contrast to L-arginine, system y+L-like did not mediate measurable L-leucine efflux from the oocyte. We propose a role of systems bo,+-like and y+L-like in the renal reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids that is based on their active tertiary transport mechanism and on the apical and basolateral localization of rBAT and 4F2hc, respectively, in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the nephron.

This is a common inherited aminoaciduria due to the defective transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids through the epithelial cells of the renal tubule and intestinal tract (4Segal S. Thier S.O. Scriver C.H. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 3581Google Scholar). Patients show urinary hyperexcretion of dibasic amino acids and cystine but not of other neutral amino acids; the low solubility of cystine leads to its precipitation and the consequent formation of renal calculi (4Segal S. Thier S.O. Scriver C.H. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 3581Google Scholar). Three types of classic cystinuria have been described on the basis of the amino acid hyperexcretion of heterozygotes and the degree of the intestinal transport defect (5Rosenberg L.E. Durant J.L.

It has been demonstrated that rBAT is only responsible for type I, where heterozygotes are silent (7Calonge M.J. Volipini V. Bisceglia L. Rousaud F. De Sanctis L. Beccia E. Zelante L. Testar X.

The rBAT protein is located in the brush border plasma membrane of the proximal straight tubules of the nephron and of the small intestine (9Furriols M. Chillarón J. Mora C. Castelló A. Bertran J.

S. A. 1993; 90: 7779-7783Google Scholar). Due to the role of rBAT in cystinuria, it is considered to be responsible for the reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids in the proximal straight tubule. Human rBAT expressed in Xenopus oocytes elicits high affinity sodium-independent transport of cystine, dibasic amino acids, and some neutral amino acids via a bo,+-like transport system (11Bertran J. Werner A. Chillarón J. Nunes V. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Estivill X. Murer H. Palacín M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14842-14849Google Scholar, 12Lee W.-S. Wells R.G. Sabbag R.V. Mohandas T.K. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1959-1963Google Scholar). Very recently, the responsibility of rBAT for this amino acid transport activity has also been demonstrated in the “renal proximal tubular” cell line OK (13Mora C. Chillarón J. Calonge M.J. Forgo J. Testar X. Nunes V. Murer H. Zorzano A. Palacín M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10569-10576Google Scholar). We refer to this as system bo,+-like, since this activity is very similar to system bo,+ described in mouse blastocysts (14Van Winkle L.J. Campione A.L. Gorman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3150-3163Google Scholar); these transport activities are not identical, since the latter does not transport L-cystine. An electrogenic exchange diffusion mechanism for dibasic and neutral amino acids has been reported for the transport activity expressed by rabbit (15Busch A. Herzer T. Waldegger S. Schmidt F.

Coady and collaborators (16Coady M.J. Jalal F. Chen X. Lemay G. Berteloot A. Lapointe J.-Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 174-178Google Scholar) showed that neutral amino acids in the trans-side are needed to observe the currents associated with the transport of L-arginine in oocytes expressing rabbit rBAT. Rennie and collaborators (17Ahmed A. Peter G.J. Taylor P.M. Harper A.A. Rennie M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8482-8486Google Scholar) suggested that this hetero-exchange could not fully explain the electric activity associated with the induced neutral amino acid transport due to rat rBAT expression in oocytes. In addition, it has been suggested that an exchange mechanism of transport does not fit the proposed role for system bo,+-like/rBAT in the active renal and intestinal amino acid reabsorption (15Busch A.

J. 1995; 310: 951-955Google Scholar). Therefore, the concentrative mechanism of amino acid transport that explains the role of system bo,+-like in the active renal reabsorption of dibasic amino acids and cystine remains to be clarified. A further objective is the identification of the transport mechanisms linking the structurally related rBAT and 4F2hc proteins (19Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15285-15288Google Scholar). Here we offer evidence that system bo,+-like, associated with rBAT expression in oocytes, is an obligatory amino acid exchanger that accumulates substrates as a tertiary amino acid transporter. Hetero-exchange between dibasic and neutral amino acids fully explains the electric activity associated with the induced amino acid transport due to human rBAT expression in oocytes, and the exchange of dibasic amino acids (inward) with neutral (outward) amino acids is favored. This amino acid transport activity explains the role of rBAT/system bo,+-like in cystinuria. In addition, we offer evidence that the human cell surface antigen 4F2hc also induces, in oocytes, an asymmetric obligatory amino acid exchanger (system y+L-like) between dibasic (outward) and neutral amino acids (inward). The participation of these two amino acid transport systems in renal reabsorption is discussed. Oocyte origin, management, and injections were as described elsewhere (11Bertran J. Werner A. Chillarón J. Nunes V. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Estivill X. Murer H. Palacín M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14842-14849Google Scholar). Defolliculated stage VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with saturating concentrations (1-5 ng/oocyte) of human rBAT, human 4F2hc, or mouse CAT1 cRNA. Except where indicated, noninjected oocytes were used as controls; amino acid transport rates obtained with oocytes injected with water (50 nl) were similar to those of uninjected oocytes (data not shown). Synthesis of human rBAT, human 4F2hc (cDNA cloned in EcoRI-HindIII pSPORT-1, from the original cDNA cloned in pSP65 by Teixeira and collaborators (21Teixeira S. Di Grandi S. Kühn L.C. J. Biol.

Influx rate measurements of L-[3H]arginine, L-[3H]leucine, and L-[35S]cystine (NEN Radiochemicals) were measured in 100 mM NaCl or 100 mM choline Cl medium at the indicated days after injection and in linear conditions as described elsewhere (11Bertran J. Werner A. Chillarón J. Nunes V. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Estivill X. Murer H. Palacín M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14842-14849Google Scholar, 19Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D.

When presented, cRNA (rBAT, 4F2hc, or CAT1)-induced uptake was calculated by subtracting uptake values in uninjected oocytes from those of the corresponding cRNA-injected oocytes. For efflux rates measurements, 3 or 4 days after injection of the corresponding cRNA, groups of 5-7 oocytes were incubated, at 25°C, for 30 min (rBAT and CAT1 experiments) or 60 min (4F2hc experiments) in medium containing 50 µML-[3H]arginine or L-[3H]leucine (3-10 µCi/90 µl). More than 95% of the oocyte-soluble radioactivity corresponded to the original labeled amino acid (see below). In five independent rBAT experiments, this loading ranged between 145,000 and 295,000 cpm/rBAT-injected oocyte and 139,000 and 315,000 cpm/rBAT-injected oocyte for L-[3H]arginine and L-[3H]leucine uptakes, respectively. In the 4F2hc experiments (n = 4), this loading ranged between 50,000 and 121,000 cpm/4F2hc-injected oocyte and 35,000 and 133,000 cpm/4F2hc-injected oocyte for L-[3H]arginine and L-[3H]leucine uptakes, respectively. For those experiments, loading of uninjected oocytes ranged between 8,000 and 21,000 cpm/oocyte and 27,000 and 88,000 cpm/oocyte for L-[3H] arginine and L- [3H]leucine uptakes, respectively. After this loading, the radioactive medium was washed 4 times in choline medium at 25°C. Then, efflux was measured as the appearance of tritium in unlabeled incubation medium (0.6-1 ml of sodium or choline medium as indicated) containing no amino acids (none) or different L-amino acids at the indicated concentrations. When L-cystine was used, efflux was always measured in the presence of 10 mM diamide to prevent L-cystine reduction. In these conditions, diamide did not affect efflux by uninjected oocytes (data not shown). Efflux was measured taking aliquots (200 µl) from the medium at zero time and at different times. Efflux rates were calculated by subtracting the radioactivity present at zero time. Previous studies demonstrated that after subtracting the zero value the best fit line passed through the origin, and it was linear for 1, 2, or 5 min for CAT1-injected, rBAT-injected, or 4F2hc-injected oocytes, respectively (data not shown). Efflux rates are expressed either as the radioactivity (cpm × 1,000) appearing in the medium per unit time (2 or 5 min) per group of 5-7 oocytes, when representative experiments are shown, or as the percent of the total radioactivity loaded into the oocyte appearing in the medium per unit time (2 or 5 min), when combined experiments are shown. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Student's t test. In the accumulation studies, the radioactivity content of rBAT cRNA-injected oocytes after 3 h incubation with L- [3H]arginine, L-[3H]leucine, or L-[35S]cystine (in the presence of 10 mM diamide) was tested for metabolization. Oocyte homogenates (choline medium) were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. More than 97% of the radioactivity from L-[3H]arginine- and L-[35S]cystine-incubated oocytes remained in the soluble phase; for L-[3H]leucine-incubated oocytes 15% of the radioactivity was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, suggesting incorporation into proteins. In the L-[35S]cystine experiments, oocytes were homogenized in the presence of 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) 1The abbreviations used are: NEMN-ethylmaleimideCAT1cationic amino acid transporter 1. to analyze L-[35S]cystine metabolites-NEM derivatives, as described elsewhere (25Schafer J.A. Watkins M.L. Pfluegers Arch. 1984; 401: 143-151Google Scholar). The soluble phase of trichloroacetic acid precipitation was analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described elsewhere (26Bertran J.

Watkins M.L. Pfluegers Arch. 1984; 401: 143-151Google Scholar for L-[35S]cystine experiments). In all cases, >95% of the radioactivity showed the same chromatographic mobility as the original incubated amino acids, visualized with 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone (L-[3H]arginine and L-[3H]leucine experiments) or by autoradiography (L-[35S]cystine experiments) (data not shown). In the absence of diamide, almost all L-[35S]cystine radioactivity was recovered, in both the oocytes and the medium, as a product with identical chromatographic mobility to the L-[35S]cysteine-NEM derivative. N-ethylmaleimide cationic amino acid transporter 1. As a reference value for the space distribution of amino acids in the oocyte in the accumulation studies, the space distribution of water was measured by incubating groups of 7-8 oocytes with [3H]water (2 µCi; ∼2.4 × 106 cpm/90 µl; Amersham Corp.) for up to 30 min. After incubation, oocytes were washed 3 times in ice-cold choline medium, and the radioactivity of SDS-dissolved single oocytes was counted with scintillation fluid in a β-radioactivity counter, as described elsewhere for uptake studies in oocytes (23Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacín M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5601-5605Google Scholar). The uptake of [3H]water increased from 30 s to 2 min and then reached a plateau (4,000-5,000 cpm), which was maintained for the next 30 min. From this we estimated a space distribution of water in stage VI oocytes of 176 ± 14 nl (mean ± S.E. from 10 groups of oocytes in 2 independent experiments). Dissection of X. laevis, collection, and handling of the oocytes was described in detail elsewhere (27Busch A.E. Kavanaugh M.P. Varnum M.D. Adelman J.P. North R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 450: 455-468Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with cRNA (1 ng/oocyte) or water, and two-electrode voltage and current clamp recordings were performed 3-8 days later in single oocytes in a perfused chamber, as described elsewhere (15Busch A. Herzer T. Waldegger S. Schmidt F. Palacín M. Biber J. Markovich D. Murer H. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25581-25586Google Scholar). The external control solution (ND96 medium) contained 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES at pH 7.5. In some experiments, Na+ was replaced by choline. The amino acids were added to the solution at the indicated concentrations, and the tested oocyte was perfused at 20 ml/min, which guaranteed a complete solution exchange in the recording chamber within 10-15 s. The maximal current amplitude induced during amino acid superfusion was measured. Inward currents are shown with the prefix -. All data are given as means (± S.E.), where n gives the number of oocyte measurements. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Student's t test. Experiments were repeated with 2 batches of oocytes; in all repetitions, qualitatively similar data were obtained. The OK cell line clone 3B/2 (28Helmle-Kölb C. Montrose M.H. Stange G. Murer H. Pflügers Arch. 1990; 415: 461-470Google Scholar), derived by selection from the original OK cells (29Koyama H. Goodpasture C. Miller M.M. Teplitz R.L. Riggs A.D.

Cell culture conditions were as described (13Mora C. Chillarón J. Calonge M.J. Forgo J. Testar X. Nunes V. Murer H. Zorzano A. Palacín M. J. Biol.

Efflux rates measurements of L-[3H]arginine into MGA medium (137 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine, 5.4 mM KCl, 2.8 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) containing or not containing unlabeled L-amino acids were as described elsewhere (13Mora C.

J. 1992; 281: 717-723Google Scholar) of the efflux medium revealed that ∼95% of the efflux radioactivity corresponded to L-arginine (data not shown). To simulate the L-3H-amino-acid, accumulation experiments were performed in oocytes expressing the human rBAT cRNA; we constructed a model based on the following premises. 1) The induced amino acid transport activity is an obligatory exchanger of dibasic and neutral amino acids with a 1:1 stoichiometry. 2) An endogenous, independent, and equilibrative transport system is necessary to explain the amino acid transport of uninjected oocytes. Fig. 1 shows the obligatory exchange “ping-pong” mechanism considered here for system bo,+-like. An alternative concerted mechanism of obligatory exchange, tested in parallel, gave similar results for the accumulation behavior to the ping-pong mechanism. The computer program written to simulate the amino acid transport activity in oocytes expressing rBAT is available upon request. The simulation was prepared according to the following steps. (i) Characteristics of the simulated system. The experimental system of L-[3H]arginine accumulation studies (Fig. 5) was reproduced as two separate compartments of 90 µl (the outside, uptake medium) and 180 nl per oocyte (the inside, the space distribution for [3H]water, see above). Initial inner concentrations of the amino acid substrates of system bo,+-like for stage VI Xenopus oocytes were set according to Taylor and Smith (31Taylor M.A. Smith L.D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 287-290Google Scholar). The concentrations of L-arginine (and L-[3H]arginine), L-leucine, and L-cystine were treated individually, whereas the rest of the amino acids were considered in two groups, neutral and dibasic. Transport rates were evaluated from the relative concentrations of transporter binary and empty complexes at either side, according to the formalism of Cha (32Cha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 820-825Google Scholar), which allows us to combine equilibrium and steady-state steps in a single mechanism. Binding steps were considered as equilibria (defined as dissociation constants, Ko, outside and Ki, inside), whereas translocation steps were considered as steady-state (defined as two translocation rate constants, kin, kout) (Fig. 1). During the simulation, amino acid concentrations at either side were modified by numerical integration of the transport rates. The equilibrium assumptions do not significantly alter the calculated rates with respect to a full steady-state mechanism. For the experiment shown in Fig. 6, superfusion experimental conditions were simulated by fixing the external concentrations to the initial values, and only internal concentrations were changed. This is reasonable as the external solution is exchanged in 10-15 s (see above).Fig. 6Efflux and influx transport rates via system bo,+-like in rBAT-injected oocytes. Oocytes were injected with 5 ng of rBAT cRNA or uninjected, and 4 days later they were assayed for efflux (closed bars) and influx (open bars) transport of the indicated amino acids in the oocyte schemes shown at the foot of the figure. For efflux studies, groups of 7 oocytes were incubated in choline uptake medium for 4 h in the presence of 1 mML-[3H]arginine or L- [3H]leucine (3 µCi/90 µl). Then efflux rates were measured in the absence or in the presence of the indicated 250 µML-amino acids. For influx studies, groups of 7 oocytes were incubated in choline uptake medium (90 µl) for 4 h in the presence of 1 mM cold L-arginine or L-leucine. Then media were removed and the oocytes were washed as indicated for efflux studies. Influx of 250 µML-[3H]arginine or L-[3H]leucine were immediately assayed for 2 min. Efflux data correspond to the amino acid-elicited efflux rates (i.e. efflux into media containing amino acids minus efflux into medium containing no amino acids). To express efflux rates as pmol/2 min per oocyte, the initial specific activity of the tracer during the accumulation phase of the study was used (see Table III). Influx rates correspond to the rBAT-induced transport activity (i.e. transport in rBAT-injected minus that in uninjected oocytes). Data (mean ± S.E.) are from 4 (efflux) and 12-14 (influx) determinations from a representative experiment. The corresponding efflux and influx rates ere not significantly different in the four groups. Efflux and influx rates in the hetero-exchange Leu (outward)/Arg (inward) were significantly higher (p ≤ 0.01) than those corresponding to the reverse hetero-exchange.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The transport rates of dibasic amino acids are markedly influenced by the membrane potential (Φ). The effect of this parameter was introduced by modification of dissociation and translocation constants according to the following equation: Pi=Pi0exp{∂ZiPΦ/πRT}(Eq. 1) where Pi is the given parameter, Pi0, its value at zero potential, Zi, the amino acid charge, F, 96,500 coulomb/mol, R, 8.31 J/mol·K, and T, the absolute temperature (fixed to 298 K), n was set to 1 for equilibrium constants, and 2 for rate constants. ∂ represents the effective fraction of the membrane potential that influences the step indicated by P. This fraction was arbitrarily set to 0.2 for binding and to 0.6 for translocation steps. This parameter (∂) has little influence on the accumulation curves (data not shown). Membrane potential was fixed to −50 mV for resting oocytes and to −35 mV for 50 µML-arginine uptake (see legend to Fig. 5). Initial potentials for other concentrations were varied according to the expected initial rates. The membrane potential was returned to the resting value after some time (see legend to Fig. 5). This effect was also included in the simulation by using a time constant of 100 min, which is a good representation of the experimental evolution. (ii) Amino acid kinetic parameters. The simulation system prepared as indicated above permits us to follow the evolution of amino acid concentrations and, therefore, to simulate experimental influx and efflux rates in any experimental condition. However, before using the system, values are required for the kinetic parameters (see Fig. 1) for every amino acid and the concentration of transporters. No direct experimental determination of transporter concentration is available; therefore, Vmax values as reported in Table I represent inseparable combinations of the transporter concentration and the translocation constants. For this reason, the translocation constants (kin and kout) for L-arginine were set arbitrarily to 1, and used as reference. The translocation constants for the remaining amino acids were then used as relative values. In this way, changes in the transporter concentration are represented by a single parameter (adjusted as indicated below), which affects every amino acid in the right proportion.Table IKinetic parameters of system b0,+-like amino acid exchanger activity associated with rBAT expression in oocytesSubstrateL-CystineL-ArginineL-LeucineInfluxKm (µM)41 ±785 ±790 ±12Vmax (pmol/min/oocyte)9 ±1211 ±1159 ±4Efflux (L-arginine)Km (µM)ND65 ±567 ±26Vmax (%oocyte loading/2 min)ND6.1 ±0.22.9 ±0.6 Open table in a new tab Relative values of translocation constants were estimated as follows.

Such experiments suggested that the abundance of N-arachidonylethanolamine phospholipid in fresh rat brain may be less than 1 in 106 phospholipid molecules. AEA generated during saponification of tissue phospholipids appears to arise from base-catalyzed aminolysis of arachidonate-containing glycerolipids, because AEA was produced from synthetic (1-stearoyl, 2-arachidonoyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine under saponification conditions, and the amount produced increased 300-fold when free ethanolamine was included in the hydrolysis solution. Although AEA was not detectable (<0.17 pmol/mg of protein) in fresh rat brain, AEA accumulated post mortem to levels of 126 pmol/mg of brain protein.

There are four MEF2 factors in vertebrates, MEF2A-D, which share homology in an amino-terminal MADS domain and an adjacent region known as the MEF2 domain, that together mediate DNA binding and dimerization. We show that serine 59 located between the MADS and MEF2 domains of MEF2C is phosphorylated in vivo and can be phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase-II (CKII).

In vivo 32P labeling experiments showed that serine 59 is the only phosphorylation site in the MADS and MEF2 domains. Mutagenesis of this serine to an aspartic acid resulted in an increase in DNA binding and transcriptional activity of MEF2C comparable to that observed when this site was phosphorylated, suggesting that phosphorylation augments DNA binding activity by introducing negative charge. This phosphorylation site, which corresponds to a CKII recognition site, is conserved in all known MEF2 factors in organisms ranging from flies to humans, consistent with its importance for the functions of MEF2C.

MEF2 factors have also been detected in nonmuscle cells, where they have been implicated in serum-inducible transcription of c-jun (15Han T.-H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Han T.-H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The recent elucidation of the crystal structure of the SRF core DNA-binding domain revealed a novel structural unit that mediates DNA sequence recognition, protein dimerization, and interaction with accessory factors (17, see also 18Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) The DNA-binding region of SRF is comprised of three structural domains. The MADS domain encompasses a coiled-coil that interacts with DNA and a central β-sheet region involved in dimerization and DNA binding. Immediately C-terminal to the MADS domain of SRF is a nonconserved region that is involved in dimerization, but does not contact DNA. Because of the extensive amino acid homology between the MADS domains of SRF and MEF2 factors, it is likely that the DNA-binding regions of these factors adopt similar conformations. While studying the DNA binding properties of MEF2, we observed that the bacterially-expressed protein bound DNA weakly, but that incubation with rabbit reticulocyte lysate significantly enhanced DNA binding activity. This suggested that MEF2 was subjected to a post-translational modification event. Here we show that MEF2C is phosphorylated in vivo at a site that lies between the MADS and MEF2 domains. Phosphorylation of this site augments DNA binding and transcriptional activity of MEF2C by increasing its DNA binding activity. This site corresponds to a CKII recognition site and can be phosphorylated by CKII in vitro. This site is conserved in all known members of the MEF2 family, consistent with its importance for MEF2 function. The region of the mouse MEF2C cDNA (4Martin J.F. Schwarz J.J. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) encoding amino acids 1-105 was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) by polymerase chain reaction. The 5′ and 3′ primers contained engineered NcoI and XhoI sites, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with these enzymes and cloned into the NcoI-XhoI sites of pET28a to allow for a COOH-terminal MEF2C fusion containing six histidine residues. Peptide production in Escherichia coli and isolation were performed as recommended by the Histidine gene fusion kit (Novagen). After purification, the integrity of the wild-type and mutant fusion proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Both fusion proteins migrated as a single species and were determined to be greater than 99% pure. Mutations were introduced into the MEF2C expression vector (4Martin J.F. Schwarz J.J. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) by rolling-circle polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis as described previously (19Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Minor variations in this procedure as well as the polymerase chain reaction conditions were as described previously (20Molkentin J.D. Kalvakalanou D. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After rolling-circle mutagenesis, a 1.4-kilobase pair fragment containing the mutated region was excised by digestion with HindIII and XbaI, subcloned into pCDNAI/amp (Invitrogen), and sequenced. Each mutant protein was tested for integrity by in vitro transcription-translation (TNT kit, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine followed by analysis on SDS-PAGE. The DNA binding properties of each mutant MEF2C protein were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with 2 µl of an in vitro transcription-translation reaction. The translated protein was incubated with 40,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus MEF2 binding site from the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) enhancer (11Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) in the presence of 1 µg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) for 10 min at room temperature. The EMSA buffer and electrophoresis conditions were as described previously (21Molkentin J.D. Markham B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19512-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For CKII treatment of bacterially expressed MEF2C 1-105 protein used in the EMSA, 1 ng was incubated with or without 1 unit of CKIIα (Promega Corp.) at 37°C for 10 min in the presence of ATP and CKII buffer (Promega Corp.). The treated protein was then incubated with 32P-labeled MCK oligo for 30 min. One nanogram of bacterially expressed MEF2C 1-105 protein was also incubated with 2 µl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate or 2 µl of heat-inactivated rabbit reticulocyte lysate in a volume of 10 µl in the presence of 1 × gel shift buffer (21Molkentin J.D. Markham B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19512-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitation of EMSA bands the gels were subject to PhosphorImager analysis. The activity of each MEF2C mutant was assessed in a transient transfection assay with the MEF2-dependent reporter pE102MEF2x2CAT, which contains two MEF2 sites from the MCK enhancer upstream of the minimal promoter from the embryonic-MHC gene (7Yu Y-T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in 10T1/2 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose and L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Ten micrograms of the pE102MEF2x2CAT reporter construct was used along with 5 µg of the MEF2C test construct and 1 µg of pRSVβGAL to control for transfection efficiency. The cells were grown to 60% confluence in 6-cm plates and transfected by calcium-phosphate precipitation for 16 h, washed, and harvested 48 h later. The cells were then scraped into 70 µl of 250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, sonicated, and centrifuged to pellet debris. Five microliters of this supernatant was then used to perform chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays. CAT assays and subsequent thin layer chromatography were performed as described (22Sternberg E. Spizz G. Perry W.M. Vizard D. Weil T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2896-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant histidine-tagged MEF2C 1-105 proteins produced in bacteria were tested for their ability to be phosphorylated in vitro with [γ-32P]ATP and purified CKIIα (Promega Corp.). One unit of CKII was incubated with 100 ng of either wild-type or mutant protein in the presence of CKII labeling buffer (Promega Corp.) and 1 mM ATP, 1 mM spermidine, 1 µl of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol) in a reaction volume of 12 µl at 37°C for 15 min. Two microliters of these reactions were then boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. In vivo phosphorylation of the 1-105 MEF2C wild-type or mutant peptide was assessed in COS cells by transfection with the mammalian expression vector pCDNAI containing DNA encoding amino acids 1-105 of MEF2C with the 7-amino acid Flag tag (Kodak IBI) fused at its COOH terminus. The Flag tag was then used for immunoprecipation of the in vivo labeled peptide. Conditions for in vivo labeling with both [35S]methionine and [32P]orthophosphate were as described previously (23Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino amino acid analysis was performed on bacterially-expressed MEF2C 1-105 following phosphorylation in vitro with purified CKII and [γ-32P]ATP, as described previously (23Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards were mixed with the MEF2C hydrolysate prior to separation by thin-layer chromatography and were visualized subsequently with Ninhydrin. The MADS and MEF2 domains, which are contained within the first 86 residues at the NH2 termini of the MEF2 factors, are sufficient for DNA binding and dimerization (reviewed in 18Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). While studying the DNA binding properties of MEF2C, we observed that the DNA-binding domain (residues 1-105) expressed in bacteria bound DNA less efficiently than the same region of MEF2C translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We therefore considered the possibility that the DNA-binding domain of MEF2C might be modified by the reticulocyte lysate so as to increase its DNA binding activity. To test this, we compared the DNA binding activity of bacterially expressed MEF2C incubated with either native rabbit reticulocyte lysate or heat-inactivated lysate. Indeed, incubation of the bacterially expressed MEF2C protein with the native rabbit reticulocyte lysate increased its DNA binding activity, whereas there was no effect with the heat-inactivated lysate (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Quantitation of this effect revealed a 5-fold increase in the DNA binding activity of MEF2C in the presence of lysate compared to control. The most likely mechanism for post-translational augmentation of MEF2C DNA binding activity would be through phosphorylation. To determine whether the MADS or MEF2 domains of MEF2C might be phosphorylated, we transfected COS cells with an expression vector encoding amino acids 1-105 of MEF2C fused to a Flag epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus. As shown in Fig. 2A, lane 1, incubation of cells with [32P]orthophosphate resulted in labeling of the MEF2C deletion mutant protein. The labeled protein migrated as a single band of ∼15 kDa. These results demonstrated that the region of sequence corresponding to the MADS and MEF2 domains of MEF2C is phosphorylated in vivo. We examined the region between amino acids 1 and 105 for potential phosphorylation sites. Amino acids 59 and 60 appeared to correspond to potential consensus sites for CKII (Fig. 2B), which phosphorylates serines and threonines flanked by acidic residues (24Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). To determine whether these residues were phosphorylated in vivo, we created a mutant (1-105/ST59,60DD) in which these residues were replaced with aspartic acids. This mutant was transfected into COS cells which were incubated in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. However, in contrast to the wild-type 1-105 peptide, no 32P incorporation was detected in the mutant 1-105 peptide (lane 2). Labeling with [35S]methionine showed that the mutant protein was expressed at a similar level to the wild-type protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). These results suggested that Ser-59 and/or Thr-60 were the only residues within the MADS and MEF2 domains of MEF2C that were phosphorylated in vivo. To test whether Ser-59 or Thr-60 were capable of being phosphorylated by CKII, we expressed MEF2C deletion mutant 1-105 in bacteria and incubated the purified fusion protein in vitro with purified CKII and [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 3A, the MEF2C protein was efficiently phosphorylated by CKII, whereas no 32P labeling was detected in the mutant 1-105/ST59,60DD. In addition, incubation of MEF2C 1-105 with activated PKC showed no phosphorylation, suggesting that this site is not subject to nonspecific phosphorylation (data not shown). To determine which of the above residues was phosphorylated by CKII, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis on the mutant 1-105 phosphorylated in vitro by CKII. Only phosphoserine was detected (Fig. 3B). We conclude that Ser-59 is the only site for CKII phosphorylation in the MADS and MEF2 domains of MEF2C. This residue and the nearby acidic residues that comprise the CKII consensus are conserved in the four vertebrate MEF2 gene products (1Breitbart R. Liang C. Smoot L.B. Laheru D. Mahdavi V.

Development. 1994; 166: 683-695Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and Caenorhabditis elegans. 2M. Kraus, personal communication. Because this identified phosphorylation site lies within a region of MEF2C required for DNA binding (9Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we examined the potential effect of CKII phosphorylation on the DNA binding activity of MEF2C. Indeed, when MEF2C 1-105 expressed in bacteria was incubated in the presence of CKII, a dramatic increase in DNA binding activity was observed (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). This increase in DNA binding activity by CKII was comparable to the augmentation observed with native rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Since reticulocyte lysate is a rich source of CKII, it is likely that CKII phosphorylation also mediates the effect of lysate on DNA binding. This potentiation of DNA binding activity by phosphorylation was observed with high affinity DNA sites, such as the MCK site, as well as with low affinity binding sites, such as the site from the α-MHC promoter (21Molkentin J.D. Markham B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19512-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6). To confirm that the increased DNA binding activity in the presence of CKII was due to phosphorylation of the MEF2C DNA-binding domain, we tested the effect of CKII on the DNA binding activity of the mutant 1-105/ST59,60CR, in which Ser-59 and Thr-60 were replaced with cysteine and arginine, respectively (Fig. 1B). This bacterially expressed mutant protein bound DNA comparably to unphosphorylated MEF2C 1-105, but in contrast to wild-type MEF2C 1-105 (lanes 1 and 2), this mutant protein failed to show an increase in DNA binding activity in the presence of CKII (lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that in vitro, CKII can augment the DNA binding activity of the MEF2C deletion protein by phosphorylation of this identified site To determine whether phosphorylation effected DNA binding activity by introducing negative charge, we compared the DNA binding activity of wild-type MEF2C 1-105 with the mutant 1-105/ST59,60DD. This mutant contains negatively charged aspartic acid residues in place of Ser-59 and Thr-60 and might be expected to mimic the effect of phosphorylation on the peptide. When translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, this mutant showed DNA binding activity comparable to that of MEF2C 1-105 (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). This suggests that the presence of a negative charge in this region is required for high-affinity DNA binding. This observation also suggests that phosphorylation of this site is stoichiometric and that the 5-fold increase in DNA binding is maximal given that the acidic substitution mutant has the same DNA binding activity as the wild-type phosphorylated protein. We also compared the DNA binding activity of wild-type MEF2C 1-105 and mutant 1-105/ST59,60CR from reticulocyte lysate. This mutant protein bound DNA less effectively than the wild-type protein, consistent with its inability to be phosphorylated by lysate (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 3) and hence a lack in negative charge at Ser-59. Furthermore, treatment of the above in vitro translation products with calf intestinal phosphatase reduced the DNA binding activity of wild-type MEF2C to a level comparable to that of the nonphosphorylated mutant ST59,60CR (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, mutant ST59,60DD failed to show a reduction in DNA binding activity in response to calf intestinal phosphatase treatment (lane 5). Together, these results confirm that the rabbit reticulocyte lysate increased the DNA binding activity of MEF2C by catalyzing its phosphorylation and they indicate that phosphorylation enhances DNA binding activity by introducing negative charge. Because the above experiments focused on the DNA binding domain of MEF2C, encompassed in residues 1-105, we also tested whether the DNA binding activity of the full-length protein was influenced by phosphorylation at Ser-59. Indeed, mutant ST59,60DD showed enhanced DNA binding activity relative to full-length wild-type MEF2C (Fig. 4). Mutant S59D showed a similar increase in DNA binding, consistent with the identification of Ser-59 as the site for phosphorylation by phosphoamino acid analysis. Mutants S59A and ST59,60CR bound DNA less efficiently than the wild-type protein (Fig. 4), consistent with their lack of negative charge at position 59 and their inability to be phosphorylated. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation at amino acid 59 affects the DNA binding properties of full-length MEF2C and the 1-105 deletion mutant to a similar extent. To determine whether the phosphorylation site in the DNA-binding domain of MEF2C influenced the transcriptional activity of the full-length protein, we compared putative CKII site mutants for their abilities to transactivate the MEF2-dependent reporter, pE102MEF2x2CAT. This reporter contains two tandem copies of the MCK MEF2 site upstream of the embryonic MHC promoter. As shown in Fig. 5, the nonphosphorylated mutant S59A showed only about 20% of the activity of the full-length wild-type protein. In contrast, mutant S59D, which contains a negative charge at position 59 and exhibits DNA binding activity comparable to the wild-type protein, showed transcriptional activity similar to that of wild-type MEF2C. Western blots were performed on extracts from transiently transfected 10T1/2 cells expressing each of these full-length mutant MEF2C proteins and wild-type MEF2C. The wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed at comparable levels suggesting that the varying degrees of transactivation were not a result of differences in protein stabilities (data not shown). These results are consistent with the conclusion that negative charge introduced by phosphorylation of Ser-59 augments transcriptional activity and that this results from a parallel increase in DNA binding activity. Our results demonstrate that Ser-59 in the DNA-binding domain of MEF2C is phosphorylated in vivo, which enhances the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of MEF2C. The importance of this site for MEF2 function is supported by the fact that it is conserved in all known members of the MEF2 family. The evidence demonstrates that MEF2 is phosphorylated in vivo at Ser-59 in a region that corresponds to a consensus CKII site. We have shown that this site is efficiently phosphorylated by CKII in vitro but not by protein kinase C. However, it is often difficult to definitively establish whether or not an identified site is indeed phosphorylated by a specific kinase in vivo. The evidence presented here suggests that CKII is likely to mediate the phosphorylation of MEF2 but it is also formally possible that another kinase may act on this site in vivo. The consensus site for CKII is (S/T)XX(D/E) in which a serine or threonine residue is flanked by acidic residues, most notably at the third position COOH-terminal (24Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). However, CKII can also recognize a site in which an acidic residue is placed at the second and fourth position COOH-terminal to the serine or threonine (29Manak J.R. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3652-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The site present in all MEF2 factors is of the amino acid sequence STDMD in which the phosphorylated serine residue is flanked by acidic residues in the second and fourth positions. The phosphorylation of Ser-59 introduces a negative charge immediately COOH-terminal to the dimerization motif of MEF2. In principle, it is possible that phosphorylation enhances DNA binding activity by affecting the efficiency of subunit dimerization. However, we have detected no effect of phosphorylation on dimerization (9Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell.

Olson, unpublished results. which supports a mechanism whereby phosphorylation of Ser-59 induces a conformational change in the DNA-binding domain of MEF2 that favors interaction with DNA. It was also of interest to determine if phosphorylation of Ser-59 had an affect on MEF2's ability to interact with myogenin/E12 heterodimers since we have previously shown that the MADS-box/MEF2 region of MEF2 proteins are capable of physically interacting with the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins to activate myogenesis (8Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mutants ST59,60DD and ST59,60CR demonstrated no difference in their abilities to interact with myogenin/E12 heterodimers or to synergize with myogenin to induce muscle gene transcription. (8Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar).3 Thus, the primary effect of phosphorylation of Ser-59 seems to be to enhance DNA binding activity, resulting in an increase in transcriptional activity of MEF2. Mutagenesis of Ser-59 in MEF2C to nonphosphorylatable amino acids eliminated all detectable phosphorylation of the MADS and MEF2 domains in transfected COS cells (Fig. 1A) and C2 muscle cells.3 Because Ser-59 and Thr-60 both correspond to the CKII phosphorylation consensus, we initially created mutants ST59-60DD and ST59-60CR in which both sites were altered to circumvent the possibility that the endogenous kinase might shift its preference between the two residues. However, mutagenesis of only the serine reside to an aspartic acid had the same affect on DNA binding activity and transactivation as the double aspartic acid mutant. We conclude therefore that under the conditions of our assays Ser-59 is the only major site for phosphorylation within the first 105 residues of MEF2C. However, it should also be pointed out that within the COOH-terminal transcription activation domains, there are several phosphorylation sites that have not yet been mapped. 4J. Zhou and E. N. Olson, unpublished observation. It has previously been shown that SRF is phosphorylated on one or more serines located at positions 77, 79, 83, and 85, which are positioned approximately 60 residues NH2-terminal of the DNA-binding domain (29Manak J.R. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3652-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this region was first shown to influence SRF by enhancing its DNA binding activity and by increasing the rate of exchange with DNA (29Manak J.R. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3652-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Janknecht R. Hipskind Houthaeve T. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H.G.

CKII phosphorylation also induces a conformational change in SRF that is postulated to directly affect the DNA-binding domain (29Manak J.R. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3652-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The extensive amino acid homology between the MADS domains of SRF and MEF2 factors suggests that the DNA-binding domains of these factors adopt similar conformations. The DNA binding core of SRF is comprised of three units (17Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The MADS-box encompasses an α-helical region that contacts DNA followed by a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that serves primarily as an interface for dimerization. These regions are likely to be structurally similar in SRF and MEF2. The region immediately COOH-terminal to the MADS-box differs in each type of MADS-box protein. In SRF, this region is oriented away from DNA and contains an irregular helically coiled region followed by a short α-helix at the top. The MEF2 domain is located in the corresponding position in the MEF2 factors, but its three-dimensional structure is unknown. How does phosphorylation enhance the DNA binding activity of MEF2? The putative CKII site in the MEF2 proteins lies at the junction of the MADS-box and MEF2 domain. By comparison with the crystal structure of SRF, this region in MEF2 would be predicted to lie away from the region of the protein that contacts DNA. Thus, the most likely possibility is that phosphorylation of this site induces a conformational change in the DNA-binding domain of MEF2 that favors interaction with DNA. It is likely that this conformational change is charge-dependent because the MEF2 mutant S59D, in which the phosphorylation site was replaced with aspartic acid, also showed enhanced DNA binding activity relative to the unphosphorylated wild-type protein or a mutant in which the phosphorylation site was changed to an alanine. Mutations of this site that altered DNA binding activity by either mimicking or preventing phosphorylation resulted in parallel effects on the transcriptional activity of MEF2C. Because replacement of Ser-59 with aspartic acid resulted in an increase in DNA binding activity comparable to that observed when MEF2C was phosphorylated by purified CKII or incubated with reticulocyte lysate, we believe that MEF2C phosphorylation at Ser-59 is stoichiometric under the above conditions. In addition to their roles in muscle gene expression, MEF2 factors have also been shown to mediate serum-inducible transcription of the c-jun gene (15Han T.-H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Han T.-H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Deletion mutations of MEF2D indicate that the serum signal is targeted at the MADS-box and MEF2 domains (16Han T.-H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have examined whether Ser-59 might be differentially phosphorylated in response to serum stimulation, but have observed no significant changes in phosphorylation at that site.3 This site is also not differentially phosphorylated in C2C12 myoblasts verses differentiatied myotubes. Thus, it appears that this site is constitutively phosphorylated in vivo and as such is not involved in serum-inducible expression. Yet it is still possible that this site is regulated by a change in the activity of a phosphatase or that this site is regulated by direct phosphorylation under certain conditions or in cell types yet to be determined.

The catalytic action of LBP is consonant with its sequence similarity to cholesterol ester transfer protein and phospholipid transfer protein (11Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gilbert T.L.

Cholesterol ester transfer protein and phospholipid transfer protein are both found on the surface of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (12Pattnaik N.M. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol.

Here we have purified the proteins from plasma that facilitate CD14-dependent responses of PMN to LPS. We found that this activity is borne on a very high density particle composed of phospholipids, apoA-I, LBP, and FH-related proteins 1 and 2 (FHRP-1 and FHRP-2). Additional proteins yet to be characterized are also present on the particle. The physical properties of this particle are described herein. Fresh frozen normal human plasma (citrated) was obtained from the New York Blood Center (New York, NY). HiPAC-Aldehyde chromatographic resin was obtained from Chromatochem (Missoula, MT). Fibrinogen (plasminogen-free human plasma fibrinogen) was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Recombinant LBP and rabbit polyclonal anti-recombinant LBP were as described (1Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against LBP (17G4) was a generous gift from Dr. David Emanuel (Indianapolis, IN). Polyclonal anti-FH antibody and anti-apoA-I antiserum was obtained from Incstar (Stillwater, MN). 3D11, a mouse monoclonal antibody that reacts with FH and FHRP-1 (22Fontaine M. Demares M.J. Koistinen V. Day A.J. Davrinche C. Sim R.B. Ripoche J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 927-930Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. Vesa Koistinen (Helsinki, Finland). ReLPS was obtained from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Goat anti-rabbit IgG and rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Bio-Rad, and rabbit anti-goat IgG was purchased from Incstar. Ouchterlony diffusion plates were purchased from The Binding Site (Birmingham, United Kingdom). Purified apoA-I and complement FH were purchased from Incstar and Calbiochem, respectively. Four units of fresh frozen plasma were thawed at room temperature, pooled, aliquoted, and frozen at −70°C until analyzed further. To begin an experiment, aliquots were thawed at 37°C and immediately placed on ice. Subsequent manipulation of the plasma was done strictly either on ice or at low temperature (4°C). Plasma was spun in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 17,000 rpm for 20 min and passed through a Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column prior to chromatography. HiPAC-Aldehyde resin was packed into a HR 5/20 or 10/30 FPLC column (Pharmacia) and equilibrated with starting buffer (Dulbecco's PBS without calcium and magnesium, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide). For the scaled up procedure, 50 ml of plasma was loaded into the column at a rate of 2 ml/min and washed with starting buffer until the absorbance (A280) came down to base line. Flow-through fractions were collected and stored for further analysis. Adsorbed material was eluted into ∼20 ml with 0.5 M ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.0, immediately subjected to dialysis against 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 or 8.5 overnight, and loaded onto a Mono Q (10/10, Pharmacia) column at a rate of 2 ml/min. The column was washed with starting buffer until the absorbance (A280) came down to base line and eluted with a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 M at 4 ml/min with a fraction size of 5 ml. Each fraction was tested for activity by the PMN adhesion assay described below. In some experiments, the active fractions were chromatographed again on the Mono Q HR 5/5 column to obtain purer and/or a more concentrated sample. Ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) was packed in a FPLC HR5/5 column (Pharmacia), and chromatography was done using 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, as starting buffer. The sample was loaded, washed with starting buffer, and eluted with a gradient of potassium phosphate from 10-400 mM over 40 ml at a rate of 1 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected. All the results shown used frozen plasma. Identical choromatographic elution pattern, SDS, and native PAGE profile and Western blotting images were obtained using plasma from freshly drawn blood (never frozen; data not shown). The enhancement of leukocyte integrin-mediated cell adhesion by LPS was measured using a two-step assay as described earlier (2Van Kessel K.P.M. Park C.T. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 25-31Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly isolated PMN were labeled with 3-5 µM of carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); PMNs were then incubated with stimuli for 10 min at 37°C. Stimuli usually consisted of a fixed dose of LPS (10 ng/ml) and varying doses of plasma or a fraction of plasma to be assayed. The PMNs were then washed and transferred to Terasaki plates coated with fibrinogen. Adhesion of the PMNs was determined by reading the fluorescence with a fluorescence plate reader (Cytofluor 2300; Millipore, Bedford, MA) before and after washing, and the percentage of PMNs adherent on the plate was calculated. All assays were done as triplicate. Lipid was extracted from the Mono Q-purified active sample with chloroform and methanol according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Phosphate was determined in the extracted sample according to the method of Ames and Dubin (24Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Google Scholar). Concentrations of triglycerides and total cholesterol (cholesterol plus cholesterol ester) were determined by an enzymatic method using a commercial kit (Sigma). The density of the particle was determined by ultracentrifugation (25Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Google Scholar). Mono Q-purified active samples were mixed with sodium bromide solutions of various densities to yield final densities of 1.006, 1.019, 1.065, 1.119, 1.219, and 1.264 g/ml. The samples were centrifuged in a Beckman Ti 42.2 rotor for 5 h at 4°C at 40,000 rpm, conditions calculated to bring lipoproteins to an equilibrium position (26Mills G.L. Lane P.A. Weech P.K. Burdon R.H. van Knippenberg P.H. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: A Guide Book to Lipoprotein Technique. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., Amsterdam1984: 18Google Scholar). At the end of the spin, the top and bottom 30 µl of the 230-µl sample were analyzed for the presence of protein by BCA protein assay (Pierce). As a control, purified human plasma low density lipoprotein (density <1.060 g/ml) was analyzed in parallel. A sandwich assay for LBP was done as described previously (14Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1025-1035Google Scholar). Briefly, plates were coated with anti-LBP monoclonal antibody 17G4 at 5 µg/ml. After blocking with a dry milk solution, samples were then added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. After washing, bound proteins were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibody against LBP and secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. A fluorescent signal was generated using the fluorogenic substrate, Attophos (JBL Scientific, San Luis Obispo, CA) and measured using a Cytofluor 2300 (Millipore). SDS (nonreducing) and native PAGE were done using either the PhastSystem (Pharmacia) or Novex system (Novex), according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Isoelectric focusing was done using the PhastSystem, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The sample in Tris buffer was directly loaded on isoelectric focusing media 3-9 (Pharmacia), and pI was determined by comparison with reference standards (Pharmacia). For electroelution experiments, samples were electrophoresed on Novex 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing condition for 2.5 h at 120 V. Lanes of a gel were cut into eight equal pieces, and the pieces were placed individually in Centrilutor (Amicon, Beverly, MA) tubes and electroeluted according to the manufacturer's recommendations at 120 V for 2 h at 4°C. A parallel lane was stained with Coomassie Blue for reference. Two-dimensional PAGE was done with the PhastSystem. The first dimension was native PAGE with a 4-15% gradient gel. After electrophoresis, the lane was cut out and boiled with SDS sample buffer for 5 min before being electrophoresed on a 10-15% gradient gel for the second dimension. A parallel lane was stained with silver (PhastGel silver kit; Pharmacia). After SDS-PAGE, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose or Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA) membranes using the PhastSystem, or Novex systems, following the instructions of the manufacturers. After transfer, the membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk, 0.2% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad), and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS for 1 h at room temperature; washed with PBS containing 0.1% milk, 0.2% Tween 20, and 0.02% sodium azide (western buffer); and incubated with primary antibodies in Western buffer either 1 h at room temperature or 4°C overnight. Membranes were washed again and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in Western buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with distilled water, membranes were stained with nitroblue tetrazolium and bromochloroindolyl phosphate (Bio-Rad) in 100 mM Tris base, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2, pH 9.5. After SDS-PAGE, polypeptides were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, briefly stained with Coomassie Blue, and washed with water. Bands were excised, and proteins were sequenced in a ABI 470A or ABI 477A instrument. Electron microscopy of Mono Q-purified active samples was done by standard negative staining methods (27Forte T.M. Nordhausen R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 442-457Google Scholar) with minor modification. Purified samples were concentrated with a Microcon centrifuge concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and buffer was exchanged at the same time into 0.125 M ammonium acetate and 0.35 mM Na-EDTA, pH 7.4. This sample was mixed 1:1 with 2% phosphotungstic acid neutralized with NaOH. Samples were loaded on Formvar carbon-coated grids, wicked off, and allowed to air dry. Samples were examined with a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope. Double immunodiffusion was done by incubating samples and antibodies in Ouchterlony plates (Binding Site) at 4°C overnight to 24 h. Plates were washed extensively with PBS and stained with Coomassie Blue. Immunoprecipitation was done with antibodies coupled to Affi-Prep Hz support (Bio-Rad). Antibodies (goat anti-FH and rabbit anti-LBP) were coupled to the support according to the manufacturer's instruction. Nonimmune antibodies (goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin; Incstar) were coupled in parallel as controls. Antibody-coupled beads (10 µl) were incubated with freshly drawn plasma (500 µl, diluted 1:1 with citrated PBS) at 4°C for 1 h with gentle mixing by rotator and washed 5-7 times with 1 ml of PBS; adsorbed proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer. Incubation of PMN with 10 ng/ml LPS alone results in no enhancement of integrin-mediated adhesion. However, the addition of normal human plasma (NHP) enables a strong LPS- and CD14-dependent adhesion response (1Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 2137-2145Google Scholar), and the dose dependence of this effect of plasma is shown in Fig. 1B. We sought the plasma factors that mediate this response to LPS and have found a chromatographic resin (HiPAC-Aldehyde) that can purify the activity from NHP. NHP (5 ml) was loaded onto the HiPAC-Aldehyde column (HR 5/20), and the flow-through fraction was assayed for the ability to promote the adhesion of PMN to fibrinogen by LPS. Although it contained 99% of plasma proteins, it was completely devoid of activity. The column was eluted with low pH buffer, and more than 90% of the original activity was recovered in the eluate (Fig. 1 and Table I). When this process was scaled up to utilize 50 ml of NHP on a HR 10/30 column somewhat less activity (65%) was recovered. The eluate of the HiPAC-Aldehyde column was further fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q. Activity was recovered as a single peak, at about 150 mM NaCl (Fig. 2). Active fractions were pooled and analyzed. We confirmed that this purified fraction stimulated cells in an LPS-dependent fashion and that the activity was completely blocked by monoclonal antibody against CD14 (Fig. 2C). Table I shows that about 700-fold enrichment was achieved using two steps of chromatography.Table I.Purification of a plasma factor that mediates PMN adhesion in response to LPSTotal AmountYieldSpecific activityaOne unit is defined as the amount of sample required for half-maximal PMN adhesion under standard assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”).Purificationmg protein%units/mgfoldNHP85001000.00581HiPAC-Aldehyde83.3900.5493Desalting7557.60.3865Mono Q5.13303.87667a One unit is defined as the amount of sample required for half-maximal PMN adhesion under standard assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”).

In B, the histogram shows the results of a PMN adhesion assay performed with pooled pairs of fractions. Very little protein and no activity appeared in flow-through fractions. More than 90% of the activity applied was recovered from fractions 17-20. In the assay shown, the maximum adhesion with 2% NHP was 23.9 ± 2.3% and with buffer alone was 2.0 ± 0.6%. In C, active fractions from Mono Q were pooled and analyzed on a PMN adhesion assay in the presence or absence of monoclonal anti-CD14 antibody, 3C10. Each column represents: 1, no antibody; 2, 3C10, 3, 3G8, monoclonal anti-FcγIII antibody; and 4, without active Mono Q fractions. Anti-CD14 antibody, 3C10, completely blocked the activity of active Mono Q fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further chromatography on ceramic hydroxyapatite yielded a column profile with a single broad peak of protein and biological activity, and these peaks coincided closely (Fig. 3). SDS-PAGE gel profiles of the material in this peak appeared identical to those of the starting material (data not shown). This observation and additional analytical data described below suggest that the preparation obtained from the Mono Q column is relatively homogeneous. On native PAGE gradient gels, the active purified fraction from plasma resolved into four or more discrete, evenly spaced bands in the interval from Mr 150,000-250,000 (Fig. 4B). A small and variable amount of protein was also observed in the Mr∼60,000 region. To verify that the species represented in the Mr 150,000-250,000 region of native gels are active in enabling responses of PMN to LPS, a native gel was run and cut into eight pieces; then electroelution of each gel piece was done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assay of each eluted sample showed that all of the activity fell in the Mr 200,000 region (Fig. 5), confirming that activity was associated with species in this region. Isoelectric focusing analysis of the purified fraction showed a tight ladder of six to seven bands with pI of 6.5-7.3 (Fig. 4B). The simplicity of its isoelectric focusing and native PAGE profiles suggests that our preparation is relatively homogeneous. Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples revealed particles of discoid shape with an indentation in the center, some forming rouleaux (Fig. 4A). Measurement of 100 particles revealed an average diameter of 11.4 ± 0.12 nm. This size is consistent with the molecular weight estimation from native gels.Fig. 5Protein and biological activity comigrate in native PAGE. Mono Q-purified active samples were separated by native PAGE (8-16% gradient gel). At the end of the run, the gel was cut into slices, electroeluted, and tested for activity in the PMN adhesion assay. Left panel, a Coomassie Blue-stained parallel lane.

SDS-PAGE of fraction 2 (inset) showed a pattern identical to the starting sample except p50 is missing (see Fig. 4B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our previous studies showed that the factor in plasma necessary for enabling responses of PMN to LPS is associated with apoA-I (14Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1025-1035Google Scholar), and we thus sought evidence that our preparation contains lipids. Lipids were extracted, and phosphate analysis of the extract showed 13.8 nmol of phosphate per 318 µg of protein. Measurement by enzymatic assay revealed, to our surprise, no detectable cholesterol or cholesterol ester (n = 3). Our assays would have detected as little as 1.7% cholesterol of total protein weight. Similarly, triglycerides were either not detected (n = 2) or were at the limit of detection (n = 1), suggesting that the particles contain less than 2.7% triglycerides of total protein weight. The density of our particles was determined as between 1.219 and 1.264 g/ml. This high density and high protein:lipid ratio of our particle is observed in very high density lipoprotein particles. SDS-PAGE showed that our preparation contained several protein bands (Fig. 4B). These include a triplet of bands near Mr 85,000 (tp85), bands of Mr 60,000 and Mr 50,000 (p60, p50), a Mr 38,000/35,000 doublet (p38/35), a Mr 30,000/28,000 doublet (p30/28), and a Mr 27,000 band (p27). The Mr 30,000/28,000 bands were seen in variable amounts, depending on the source of NHP. All of the other bands were reproducibly obtained in more than 10 separate preparations, although some minor variation was noted in relative intensity of each band. Electroeluted samples from the Mr∼200,000 area of a native gel gave rise to an identical SDS gel pattern, except for the absence of p50 (Fig. 5, inset), indicating that each of the bands seen in the SDS-PAGE derive from Mr 200,000 particles except p50. Additionally, two-dimensional gel analysis, with native PAGE in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second, showed that each of the native gel species in the Mr 150,000-250,000 range gave rise to an almost identical pattern of polypeptides in the second dimension (Fig. 6). Thus, we have isolated a complex of lipid and protein that mediates responses of PMN to LPS. The properties of the complex are most similar to very high density lipoprotein. We have identified most of the polypeptides by a combination of immunochemistry and protein sequencing. LBP is known to enable PMN to respond to LPS (3Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Rockwell P. Detmers P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1281-1286Google Scholar), and the presence of LBP in purified fractions was explored by Western blot analysis with antibodies raised against recombinant LBP. A Mr 60,000 band was detected in a position identical with that of purified recombinant LBP (data not shown) and with p60 of our sample (Fig. 7). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for LBP showed that there were 12 µg of LBP in a 150 µg/ml preparation of the particle. This finding indicates that 8% of the protein in our preparation is LBP and suggests that LBP comprises the Mr 60,000 band in our preparation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis further showed that LBP was only found in the active fractions from the HiPAC-Aldehyde and Mono Q columns. Recent experiments from our laboratory have shown that LBP and its biological activity are quantitatively retained on columns of anti-apoA-I (14Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1025-1035Google Scholar). We, therefore, used Western blot analysis to determine if apoA-I was present in our purified fraction. A Mr 27,000 band (p27), which corresponds to the size of apoA-I, was recognized by anti-apoA-I, both in the fractions purified from the Mono Q column (Fig. 7) and in the samples electroeluted from the high molecular weight area of native"
https://openalex.org/W2078007825,"A yeast mutant (LT06) was isolated that showed no growth on iron-limited medium but normal growth on iron-replete medium. A gene cloned from a genomic yeast library complemented the defect, allowing growth on low iron medium. Allelic segregation analysis demonstrated that the cloned gene was the normal allele rather than a high copy suppressor. A disruption mutant was nonviable, indicating that the gene was essential. Sequence analysis and functional assays indicated that the cloned gene was identical to ERG25, a gene that codes for methyl sterol oxidase. Incubation of LT06 in low iron medium resulted in marked changes in lipid metabolism, including the accumulation of fatty acids, triglycerides, methyl sterols, and other sterol precursors. A human homologue of ERG25 was cloned, sequenced, and mapped to human chromosome 4q32-34. Analysis of the data base with both ERG25 and the human homologue resulted in the identification of a putative set of metal binding motifs with similarity to that seen in a family of membrane desaturases-hydroxylases. Western analysis using antibodies to an Erg25-GST fusion protein detected two proteins of 34 and 75 kDa. Both proteins are membrane bound and contain one N-glycosyl unit. Immunofluorescence data suggest that the proteins are present in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. Although ERG25 transcripts are not iron regulated, there is a large increase in the concentration of transcript in the mutant LT06 grown in low iron medium. These results suggest that the enzyme is regulated not by iron but by an end product of the ergosterol pathway."

INTRODUCTIONThe responses of eukaryotic cells to extracellular signals such as cytokines and insulin are generally mediated by transmembrane receptor proteins with extracellular sensory domains that are connected via a single α-helical transmembrane sequence to an intracellular signaling domain. Although these proteins have widely divergent sequences, considerable evidence suggests that they share a common mechanism of transmembrane signaling. The binding of stimulatory ligands to the extracellular sensory domains is thought to induce monomer to dimer transitions (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar). This facilitates dimer interactions in the intracellular signaling portions of the proteins that lead to the generation of a response. Hormone-induced receptor polymerization has been demonstrated in a number of instances, and the x-ray crystal structure of the extracellular sensory portion of the human growth factor receptor indicates a single asymmetric hormone binding site between monomers in a receptor homodimer (3DeVos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar). Moreover, for several different types of signaling domains, including those with tyrosine kinase and guanylyl cyclase activities, it has been shown that activation requires dimer interactions (2Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar).Bacteria also have membrane receptors with transmembrane sequences that connect extracellular sensing domains to intracellular signaling domains (4Stock J.B. Surette M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1103Google Scholar, 5Kim S.-H.

The membrane topology in bacteria differs slightly from that of most eukaryotic transmembrane receptors in that N-terminal signal sequences that function during protein synthesis to direct the receptors to the membrane are generally removed from eukaryotic receptors, but not from their bacterial counterparts, so that the bacterial proteins have two transmembrane sequences per monomer, whereas the eukaryotic receptors only have one. By far the best characterized bacterial membrane receptor is the protein, designated Tar, 1The abbreviations used are: Tarreceptor for taxis to aspartate and repellentsTM1transmembrane segment 1TM2transmembrane segment 2MH1methylated helix 1MH2methylated helix 2SDsignaling domainLZleucine zipperMCPmethyl accepting chemotaxis proteinTsrreceptor for taxis to serine and repellentsPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. that mediates Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium chemotaxis responses to aspartate. Tar has been shown to form a homodimer that is stabilized by aspartate binding (8Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Google Scholar). Each Tar monomer is composed of a periplasmic aspartate binding domain attached by a membrane-spanning hydrophobic sequence to a cytoplasmic signaling region (Fig. 1). The x-ray crystal structure of the ligand binding domain has been solved both in the presence and absence of aspartate (9Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland D.E.J. Kim S.-H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Google Scholar, 10Yeh J.I. Biemann H.P. Pandit J. Koshland D.E. Kim S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9787-9792Google Scholar, 11Scott W.G. Milligan D.L. Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Yeh J. Koshland D.E.J. Kim S.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 555-573Google Scholar). It is essentially a dimer of two four helix bundles that bind aspartate at the subunit interface. The first transmembrane helix of each monomer, TM1, is thought to be continuous with the first α-helix of the ligand binding domain, and the last α-helix of this domain is thought to be continuous with the transmembrane helix that leads to the cytoplasm, TM2 (9Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland D.E.J. Kim S.-H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Google Scholar, 12Pakula A.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4144-4148Google Scholar). Thus, the structural studies of the bacterial receptor are consistent with a model for stimulus-response coupling that is similar to the mechanism of action that has been proposed for single transmembrane receptors in eukaryotic cells with stimulatory ligand binding causing receptor dimerization and thereby leading to a response. Several lines of evidence argue strongly against the idea that Tar activity is regulated by receptor dimerization, however.Tar signals through a protein kinase, CheA, by controlling the rate at which CheA autophosphorylates at a histidine residue (13Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Google Scholar, 14Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Google Scholar). The kinase has a multidomain structure with distinct catalytic and phosphoaccepting domains (15Swanson R.V. Schuster S.C. Simon M.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7623-7629Google Scholar, 16Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Google Scholar), and autophosphorylation involves the kinase domain of each subunit within a dimer catalyzing the phosphorylation of a histidine in the opposing subunit (17Wolfe A.J. Stewart R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1518-1522Google Scholar, 18Swanson R.V. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 435-441Google Scholar). Isolated CheA is in equilibrium between an inactive monomer and an active dimer (19Surette M. Levit M. Liu Y. Lukat G. Ninfa E. Ninfa A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 939-945Google Scholar), and CheA dimers form a stable complex with dimeric Tar (20Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 18: 975-982Google Scholar). Complex formation requires binding of a third protein, CheW (20Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 18: 975-982Google Scholar, 21Gegner J.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 750-754Google Scholar). Rates of CheA dimer autophosphorylation within this ternary complex are either inhibited or stimulated, depending on the signaling state of the receptor (14Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Google Scholar, 13Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Google Scholar, 22Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Google Scholar). Aspartate binding does not appear to affect the stability of the receptor-CheW-CheA complex, however (20Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 18: 975-982Google Scholar). Moreover, despite the fact that aspartate promotes receptor dimerization (8Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Google Scholar) and dimerization is required for the activity of the signal transducing kinase (19Surette M. Levit M. Liu Y. Lukat G. Ninfa E. Ninfa A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 939-945Google Scholar), aspartate binding to the Tar-CheW-CheA complex functions to inhibit kinase activity (13Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Google Scholar, 14Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Google Scholar). It has also been shown that receptors cross-linked through cysteines introduced at complimentary positions along the subunit interface between receptor monomers are still able to respond to stimuli (23Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24043-24053Google Scholar, 24Chervitz S.A. Lin C.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9722-9733Google Scholar, 25Lee G.F. Lebert M.R. Lilly A.A. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3391-3395Google Scholar, 26Lee G.F. Dutton D.P. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5416-5420Google Scholar). From these results it is clear that stimulus-response coupling involves the propagation of a conformational change across the membrane within a dimeric receptor signaling complex. Thus, although dimerization is required for receptor signaling, it is not sufficient. This is consistent with results obtained with some eukaryotic receptors. The insulin receptor, for instance, naturally occurs as a disulfide-linked dimer, so at least in this case a monomer-dimer transition is not responsible for stimulus-response coupling (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar).To understand the conformational change responsible for stimulus-response coupling in bacterial chemotaxis, we have attempted to reconstitute the active ternary complex using CheA, CheW, and soluble cytoplasmic fragments of the receptor. The cytoplasmic portion of the receptor contains two sequences of approximately 35 residues that are predicted to have a high propensity to form α-helical coiled-coil structures (27Lupas A. VanDyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Google Scholar, 28Stock J.B. Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 109-136Google Scholar). These sequences, termed MH1 and MH2, contain several specific glutamine and glutamate residues that are subject to deamidation and reversible methylation (4Stock J.B. Surette M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1103Google Scholar). Receptor signaling activity is regulated by the level of methylation/amidation (14Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Google Scholar, 22Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Google Scholar, 29Springer M.S. Goy M.F. Adler J. Nature. 1979; 280: 279-284Google Scholar). Methylation promotes kinase activation, and demethylation or deamidation, like aspartate binding, inhibits kinase activity. MH1 and MH2 flank a sequence of approximately 150 residues that has been termed the signaling domain. Genetic studies indicate that this region interacts with CheW (30Liu J. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4941-4951Google Scholar).Here we show that the aspartate receptor Tar signaling domain is in fact an independently folding unit that binds CheW. The signaling domain expressed in intact cells inhibits kinase activity, presumably by sequestering CheW from endogenous receptors. We were able to activate the kinase in cells with a construct that expressed a fragment composed of MH1 and the signaling domain. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that MH1 helices come together in a coiled-coil to properly position the signaling domains and their associated CheW protein for formation of an active complex with CheA. This idea was corroborated by the finding that replacement of the MH1 region by a completely unrelated coiled-coil, the leucine zipper region of a transcriptional activator, produced a construct that was also able to activate the kinase. Finally, a construct generated by fusion of the transcription factor leucine zipper domain to the entire cytoplasmic region of the receptor in a position that corresponds to TM2 in the intact receptor is able to form an active complex that is regulated by glutamate modifications in much the same way as the intact receptor. The effects of constructs on receptor signaling in vivo were confirmed with purified components in vitro. These findings support a model for receptor signaling where aspartate binding controls the relative orientation of receptor monomers to favor formation of a coiled-coil between MH1 and/or MH2 within each monomer. The level of amidation and methylation of MH1 and MH2 glutamates could control the formation of these coiled-coils by neutralizing their anionic carboxylate side chains and thereby attenuating repulsive electrostatic interactions between the helical interfaces.DISCUSSIONThe aspartate receptor, Tar, belongs to a large family of membrane receptor transducer proteins that interact with CheA and CheW proteins to provide sensory inputs that control the chemotactic responses of bacteria (for a review, see 4Stock J.B. Surette M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1103Google Scholar). These receptors, termed methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins or MCPs, are characterized by a highly conserved cytoplasmic signaling domain, SD, flanked by regions that contain glutamine or glutamate residues that are subject to deamidation, methylation, and demethylation contained in sequences that are predicted to form α-helical coiled-coil structures, MH1 and MH2. Here we show that the signaling domain is an independently folded unit that binds CheW. We find no evidence for a significant interaction between the signaling domain and CheA. Previous genetic and biochemical results have indicated that this portion of the serine receptor Tsr, which has an almost identical signaling domain, interacts with the CheA protein to suppress tumbly behavior in vivo and inhibit the kinase in vitro (45Ames P. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6340-6348Google Scholar). The results with Tsr SD constructs were obtained at concentrations at least an order of magnitude above those used here, however, and mutant forms of the protein were used that had been selected for their ability to suppress tumbling behavior.It has previously been shown that the Tsr-SD with an associated MH1 coiled-coil sequence stimulates tumbly behavior in vivo, and together with CheW activates CheA kinase in vitro (45Ames P. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6340-6348Google Scholar). We have obtained similar results with a corresponding fragment of Tar, the MH1-SD construct. It seems likely that the activity of this receptor fragment depends on the potential of the coiled-coil region to facilitate the formation of SD dimers. A weak 1:1 interaction between CheA and CheW has been detected, KD = 20 µM (20Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 18: 975-982Google Scholar). Since CheW is monomeric at micromolar concentrations (20Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 18: 975-982Google Scholar) and CheA is dimeric (19Surette M. Levit M. Liu Y.

A. 1991; 88: 750-754Google Scholar), assuming independent binding sites for CheW on CheA and SD, one would predict that a monomeric SD-complex would have a KD of 20 µM for CheA, whereas a dimeric SD-CheW complex would have a KD for CheA significantly lower than 20 µM. The supposition that dimerization greatly facilitates complex formation was confirmed by the finding that a leucine zipper coiled-coil dimerization domain can act in place of the MH1 sequence to facilitate tumbling behavior. The use of coiled-coil domains as engineered dimerization motifs has been successfully applied to several eukaryotic receptors (50Chang H.-C. Bao Z.-Z. Yao Y. Tse A.G.D. Goyarts E.C. Madsen M. Kawasaki E. Brauer P.P. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11408-11412Google Scholar, 51Muir T.W. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. Kent S.B.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7701-7708Google Scholar, 52Wu Z. Eaton S.F. Laue T.M. Johnson K.W. Sana T.S. Ciardelli T.L. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1137-1144Google Scholar).Activation of the signaling domain using either MH1 or a leucine zipper motif suggests that the MH1 regions are positioned in such a way as to allow the formation of an active complex. This tends to confirm the notion that there is an interaction of MH1 regions from both monomers in the native receptor dimer. Our results suggest that MH1-MH1′ interactions in the receptor dimer may be regulated by interactions with MH2/MH2′. Both MH1 and MH2 score with probabilities greater than 50% when analyzed with programs that are designed to predicted coiled-coil structures (27Lupas A. VanDyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Google Scholar, 53Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Google Scholar). Tar receptor fragments that contain both the MH1- and MH2-flanking regions are less efficient in promoting tumbly behavior or activating the kinase then MH1-SD fragments or constructs with an associated leucine zipper dimerization domain. Moreover, SD-MH2 fragments, as shown here with Tar, or previously with Tsr (45Ames P. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6340-6348Google Scholar), fail to promote tumbly behavior in vivo. These results are consistent with our previous proposal (28Stock J.B. Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 109-136Google Scholar) that MH2 can fold back to make intramolecular helical interactions thereby forming four helix bundles in intact receptor dimers. One might expect that such MH1-MH2 intramolecular contacts would attenuate the propensity for the MH1 intermolecular interactions that presumably cause dimerization of monomeric MH1-SD fragments.We have previously proposed that methylation or amidation controls the orientation of subunits within multimeric receptor complexes by modulating electrostatic interactions between MH1 and MH2 coiled-coil sequences (28Stock J.B. Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 109-136Google Scholar). The observations reported here for the effects of glutamate to glutamine mutagenesis are consistent with this view. The finding that even MH1-SD-MH2 constructs with an associated leucine zipper motif modulate kinase activity in response to glutamate modification much as do receptors in membranes suggests that the conformational effects of these modifications can occur independently of the transmembrane or periplasmic portions of the proteins.The formation of active ternary complexes between CheA, CheW, and the receptor is a complex process. Coiled-coil sequences are known to participate in different types of assemblies and can form dynamic structures which readily exhibit transitions between multiple forms (54Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Google Scholar, 55Lovejoy B. Choe S. Cascio D. McRorie D.K. DeGrado W.F. Eisenberg D. Science. 1993; 259: 1288-1293Google Scholar). It has been well established that coiled-coil transitions play important roles in controlling the activities of transcription factors, cytoskeletal elements, and many different types of activities of membrane proteins such as α-hemaglutinin. Our results suggest that the dynamic nature of these structures can also play a central role in modulating the transmembrane signaling activities of chemotaxis receptors in bacteria. Reconstituting the activated and adapted states of the chemotaxis receptors in a soluble system with defined components means that an analysis of this dynamic system can now be accomplished using a combination of well established biophysical methods.Note Added in ProofCochran and Kim (Cochran, A. G., and Kim, P. S. (1996) Science 271, 1113-1116) have recently reported kinase activation by a leucine zipper-Tar construct where a leucine zipper dimerization domain is fused to MH1 (analogous to our LZ-MH1-SD-MH2 constructs). They found that the phasing of the leucine zipper helix with respect to MH1 was important for activation and/or complex formation. In our leucine zipper constructs a flexible linker has been engineered between the leucine zipper and the indicated Tar fragment so that phasing is presumably not an issue. INTRODUCTIONThe responses of eukaryotic cells to extracellular signals such as cytokines and insulin are generally mediated by transmembrane receptor proteins with extracellular sensory domains that are connected via a single α-helical transmembrane sequence to an intracellular signaling domain. Although these proteins have widely divergent sequences, considerable evidence suggests that they share a common mechanism of transmembrane signaling. The binding of stimulatory ligands to the extracellular sensory domains is thought to induce monomer to dimer transitions (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar). This facilitates dimer interactions in the intracellular signaling portions of the proteins that lead to the generation of a response. Hormone-induced receptor polymerization has been demonstrated in a number of instances, and the x-ray crystal structure of the extracellular sensory portion of the human growth factor receptor indicates a single asymmetric hormone binding site between monomers in a receptor homodimer (3DeVos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar). Moreover, for several different types of signaling domains, including those with tyrosine kinase and guanylyl cyclase activities, it has been shown that activation requires dimer interactions (2Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar).Bacteria also have membrane receptors with transmembrane sequences that connect extracellular sensing domains to intracellular signaling domains (4Stock J.B. Surette M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1103Google Scholar, 5Kim S.-H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 159-165Google Scholar, 6Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Google Scholar, 7Hazelbauer G.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 505-510Google Scholar). The membrane topology in bacteria differs slightly from that of most eukaryotic transmembrane receptors in that N-terminal signal sequences that function during protein synthesis to direct the receptors to the membrane are generally removed from eukaryotic receptors, but not from their bacterial counterparts, so that the bacterial proteins have two transmembrane sequences per monomer, whereas the eukaryotic receptors only have one. By far the best characterized bacterial membrane receptor is the protein, designated Tar, 1The abbreviations used are: Tarreceptor for taxis to aspartate and repellentsTM1transmembrane segment 1TM2transmembrane segment 2MH1methylated helix 1MH2methylated helix 2SDsignaling domainLZleucine zipperMCPmethyl accepting chemotaxis proteinTsrreceptor for taxis to serine and repellentsPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. that mediates Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium chemotaxis responses to aspartate. Tar has been shown to form a homodimer that is stabilized by aspartate binding (8Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Google Scholar). Each Tar monomer is composed of a periplasmic aspartate binding domain attached by a membrane-spanning hydrophobic sequence to a cytoplasmic signaling region (Fig. 1). The x-ray crystal structure of the ligand binding domain has been solved both in the presence and absence of aspartate (9Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland D.E.J. Kim S.-H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Google Scholar, 10Yeh J.I. Biemann H.P. Pandit J. Koshland D.E. Kim S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9787-9792Google Scholar, 11Scott W.G. Milligan D.L. Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Yeh J. Koshland D.E.J. Kim S.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 555-573Google Scholar). It is essentially a dimer of two four helix bundles that bind aspartate at the subunit interface. The first transmembrane helix of each monomer, TM1, is thought to be continuous with the first α-helix of the ligand binding domain, and the last α-helix of this domain is thought to be continuous with the transmembrane helix that leads to the cytoplasm, TM2 (9Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland D.E.J. Kim S.-H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Google Scholar, 12Pakula A.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4144-4148Google Scholar). Thus, the structural studies of the bacterial receptor are consistent with a model for stimulus-response coupling that is similar to the mechanism of action that has been proposed for single transmembrane receptors in eukaryotic cells with stimulatory ligand binding causing receptor dimerization and thereby leading to a response. Several lines of evidence argue strongly against the idea that Tar activity is regulated by receptor dimerization, however.Tar signals through a protein kinase, CheA, by controlling the rate at which CheA autophosphorylates at a histidine residue (13Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Google Scholar, 14Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Google Scholar). The kinase has a multidomain structure with distinct catalytic and phosphoaccepting domains (15Swanson R.V. Schuster S.C. Simon M.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7623-7629Google Scholar, 16Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Google Scholar), and autophosphorylation involves the kinase domain of each subunit within a dimer catalyzing the phosphorylation of a histidine in the opposing subunit (17Wolfe A.J. Stewart R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1518-1522Google Scholar, 18Swanson R.V. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 435-441Google Scholar). Isolated CheA is in equilibrium between an inactive monomer and an active dimer (19Surette M. Levit M. Liu Y. Lukat G. Ninfa E. Ninfa A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 939-945Google Scholar), and CheA dimers form a stable complex with dimeric Tar (20Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 18: 975-982Google Scholar). Complex formation requires binding of a third protein, CheW (20Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 18: 975-982Google Scholar, 21Gegner J.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 750-754Google Scholar). Rates of CheA dimer autophosphorylation within this ternary complex are either inhibited or stimulated, depending on the signaling state of the receptor (14Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Google Scholar, 13Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Google Scholar, 22Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Google Scholar). Aspartate binding does not appear to affect the stability of the receptor-CheW-CheA complex, however (20Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 18: 975-982Google Scholar). Moreover, despite the fact that aspartate promotes receptor dimerization (8Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Google Scholar) and dimerization is required for the activity of the signal transducing kinase (19Surette M. Levit M. Liu Y. Lukat G. Ninfa E. Ninfa A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 939-945Google Scholar), aspartate binding to the Tar-CheW-CheA complex functions to inhibit kinase activity (13Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Google Scholar, 14Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Google Scholar). It has also been shown that receptors cross-linked through cysteines introduced at complimentary positions along the subunit interface between receptor monomers are still able to respond to stimuli (23Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24043-24053Google Scholar, 24Chervitz S.A. Lin C.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9722-9733Google Scholar, 25Lee G.F. Lebert M.R. Lilly A.A. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3391-3395Google Scholar, 26Lee G.F. Dutton D.P. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5416-5420Google Scholar). From these results it is clear that stimulus-response coupling involves the propagation of a conformational change across the membrane within a dimeric receptor signaling complex. Thus, although dimerization is required for receptor signaling, it is not sufficient. This is consistent with results obtained with some eukaryotic receptors. The insulin receptor, for instance, naturally occurs as a disulfide-linked dimer, so at least in this case a monomer-dimer transition is not responsible for stimulus-response coupling (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar).To understand the conformational change responsible for stimulus-response coupling in bacterial chemotaxis, we have attempted to reconstitute the active ternary complex using CheA, CheW, and soluble cytoplasmic fragments of the receptor. The cytoplasmic portion of the receptor contains two sequences of approximately 35 residues that are predicted to have a high propensity to form α-helical coiled-coil structures (27Lupas A. VanDyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Google Scholar, 28Stock J.B. Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 109-136Google Scholar). These sequences, termed MH1 and MH2, contain several specific glutamine and glutamate residues that are subject to deamidation and reversible methylation (4Stock J.B. Surette M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1103Google Scholar). Receptor signaling activity is regulated by the level of methylation/amidation (14Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Google Scholar, 22Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Google Scholar, 29Springer M.S. Goy M.F. Adler J. Nature. 1979; 280: 279-284Google Scholar). Methylation promotes kinase activation, and demethylation or deamidation, like aspartate binding, inhibits kinase activity. MH1 and MH2 flank a sequence of approximately 150 residues that has been termed the signaling domain. Genetic studies indicate that this region interacts with CheW (30Liu J. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4941-4951Google Scholar).Here we show that the aspartate receptor Tar signaling domain is in fact an independently folding unit that binds CheW. The signaling domain expressed in intact cells inhibits kinase activity, presumably by sequestering CheW from endogenous receptors. We were able to activate the kinase in cells with a construct that expressed a fragment composed of MH1 and the signaling domain. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that MH1 helices come together in a coiled-coil to properly position the signaling domains and their associated CheW protein for formation of an active complex with CheA. This idea was corroborated by the finding that replacement of the MH1 region by a completely unrelated coiled-coil, the leucine zipper region of a transcriptional activator, produced a construct that was also able to activate the kinase. Finally, a construct generated by fusion of the transcription factor leucine zipper domain to the entire cytoplasmic region of the receptor in a position that corresponds to TM2 in the intact receptor is able to form an active complex that is regulated by glutamate modifications in much the same way as the intact receptor. The effects of constructs on receptor signaling in vivo were confirmed with purified components in vitro. These findings support a model for receptor signaling where aspartate binding controls the relative orientation of receptor monomers to favor formation of a coiled-coil between MH1 and/or MH2 within each monomer. The level of amidation and methylation of MH1 and MH2 glutamates could control the formation of these coiled-coils by neutralizing their anionic carboxylate side chains and thereby attenuating repulsive electrostatic interactions between the helical interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2002093858,"Several neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases are caused by genetically unstable triplet repeat sequences (CTG·CAG, CGG·CCG, or AAG·CTT) in or near the responsible genes. We implemented novel cloning strategies with chemically synthesized oligonucleotides to clone seven of the triplet repeat sequences (GTA·TAC, GAT·ATC, GTT·AAC, CAC·GTG, AGG·CCT, TCG·CGA, and AAG·CTT), and the adjoining paper (Ohshima, K., Kang, S., Larson, J. E., and Wells, R. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 16784-16791) describes studies on TTA·TAA. This approach in conjunction with in vivo expansion studies in Escherichia coli enabled the preparation of at least 81 plasmids containing the repeat sequences with lengths of ∼16 up to 158 triplets in both orientations with varying extents of polymorphisms. The inserts were characterized by DNA sequencing as well as DNA polymerase pausings, two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, and chemical probe analyses to evaluate the capacity to adopt negative supercoil induced non-B DNA conformations. AAG·CTT and AGG·CCT form intramolecular triplexes, and the other five repeat sequences do not form any previously characterized non-B structures. However, long tracts of TCG·CGA showed strong inhibition of DNA synthesis at specific loci in the repeats as seen in the cases of CTG·CAG and CGG·CCG (Kang, S., Ohshima, K., Shimizu, M., Amirhaeri, S., and Wells, R. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 27014-27021). This work along with other studies (Wells, R. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 2875-2878) on CTG·CAG, CGG·CCG, and TTA·TAA makes available long inserts of all 10 triplet repeat sequences for a variety of physical, molecular biological, genetic, and medical investigations. A model to explain the reduction in mRNA abundance in Friedreich's ataxia based on intermolecular triplex formation is proposed."

Thus, either the Jaks, the Stats, or both could contribute to the specificity of ligand action.

This pathway is activated predominantly through receptors which do not possess intrinsic intracellular kinase domains and belong to the class I or class II cytokine receptor superfamily. The lack of inherent catalytic activity in these receptors is overcome through the use of receptor-associated kinases of the Janus kinase (Jak) family. Upon ligand binding, the receptor chains oligomerize allowing the associated kinases to interact and likely cross-activate each other by tyrosine phosphorylation. Subsequently, the activated Jaks directly phosphorylate the intracellular domains of the receptors on specific tyrosine residues. This phosphorylation allows the selective recruitment of SH2-domain containing proteins, particularly Stats (signal transducers and activators of transcription), through a specific interaction between the Stat SH2 domains and the phosphotyrosines within the Stat recruitment sites of the intracellular domains of the receptor chains. These receptor-associated Stats are then rapidly phosphorylated, likely by the activated Jaks (Quelle et al., 64Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W. Witthuhn B.A. Tang B. Cohen S. Ihle J.N. J. Biol.

The Jak kinases are characterized by seven conserved domains: two PTK-related domains and five domains with unknown functions (Ziemiecki et al., 97Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The main difference between Jaks and other protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) is that along with a kinase domain, shown to be active (Wilks et al., 92Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Kurban R.R. Ralph S.J. Züercher G. Ziemiecki A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), they also contain a PTK-like domain with substitutions of several residues essential for kinase activity. Thus, the second domain is expected to be inactive as a PTK and probably has some other function. Another feature of this family is the lack of any detectable SH2 or SH3 domains. The functions of the other five regions of homology are also unknown. Stats represent proteins containing SH2, SH3, and DNA-binding domains (for reviews, see Darnell et al. (14Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar) and Fu (26Fu X.-Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). The highly selective and specific interaction between Stat SH2 domains and the phosphotyrosine containing Stat recruitment sites on the intracellular domains of the cytokine receptors determines which Stats are to be recruited to a particular receptor complex (Heim et al., 31Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar; Stahl et al., 80Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The intracellular domain of each cytokine receptor specifically associates with one or more distinct Jaks. While some Jaks and Stats participate in several cytokine signaling pathways, others are more restricted. In the case of Jaks, Jak2, and, especially Jak1, associate with receptors participating in different apparently unrelated cytokine-receptor systems (for reviews, see Ziemiecki et al. (97Ziemiecki A.

Jak3 appears to be restricted to the ligand receptor systems through its association with the IL-2RγC chain (Johnston et al., 39Johnston J. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A. Chen Y.-Q. Blake T.B. Shibuya K.

Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and also during ciliary neurotrophic factor-related cytokine signaling, albeit only in certain cell types (Stahl et al., 79Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D.

Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Recently, the activation of Tyk2 by IL-10 and IL-12 was shown (Finbloom and Winestock, 22Finbloom D.S. Winestock K.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1079-1090PubMed Google Scholar; Bacon et al., 5Bacon C.M.

More K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, the Jaks may contribute to the specificity of signal transduction at some level. In the case of IFN-γ and IFN-α signal transduction, the activation of Jak1 and Stat1 occurs in both pathways, however, Tyk2 and Stat2 are activated only during IFN-α signaling; and Jak2 only in the IFN-γ signal transduction pathway. Thus, it was proposed that there may be substrate specificity of Jaks for Stats (Ihle et al., 37Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). To assess whether the specificity of signal transduction resides in the Jaks, we prepared a variety of chimeric receptors based on the human IFN-γ receptor complex. The extracellular domain of the second human IFN-γ receptor chain, designated Hu-IFN-γR2 or AF-1 (Soh et al., 77Soh J. Donnelly R.J. Kotenko S. Mariano T.M. Cook J.R. Wang N. Emanuel S. Schwartz B. Miki T. Pestka S. Cell. 1994; 76 (a): 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), was fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of various receptors. We then determined which chimeric receptors could support signal transduction. The result of these studies are reported here. Taq polymerase and all restriction endonucleases were from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals or New England Biolabs; Sequenase 2.0 and T4 DNA ligase were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The [α-32P]dATP and [γ-32P]ATP were from DuPont NEN. The cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate was from Pierce Chemical Co. All other chemical reagents were analytical grade and purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The vector pγR2 expressing the Hu-IFN-γR2 chain under control of cytomegalovirus promoter was constructed as described previously (Soh et al., 77Soh J. Donnelly R.J. Kotenko S. Mariano T.M. Cook J.R. Wang N. Emanuel S. Schwartz B. Miki T. Pestka S. Cell. 1994; 76 (a): 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar; Kotenko et al., 43Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20915-20921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The vector pγR1 expressing the Hu-IFN-γR1 chain was constructed as follows. The pHu-IFN-γR8 plasmid (Kumar et al., 44Kumar C.S. Muthukumaran G. Frost L.J. Noe M. Ahn Y.H. Mariano T.M. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17939-17946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with HindIII restriction endonuclease, incubated with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I and dNTPs to fill in the ends, and then digested with BamHI restriction endonuclease. The fragment containing the Hu-IFN-γR1 cDNA was ligated into EcoRV and BamHI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The Hu-IFN-αR1 cDNA was recloned from HuIFNAR1/pcDNAI (Lim, 49Lim, J., 1995, Cloning of a Bovine Alpha Interferon Receptor and Studies of Ligand Binding, Ph.D. thesis, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ.Google Scholar) into pcDNA3 with EcoRI and XbaI restriction endonucleases. The expression vector was designated pαR1. The PCR products for Hu-IFN-αR2 cDNA were obtained by a nested PCR procedure with a λpCEV15 phage DNA mixture isolated from about 5 × 106 phage clones from the human M426 cell library (Miki et al., 57Miki T. Matsui T. Heidaran M.A. Aaronson S.A. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as template. The primers for the first round of PCR were: 5′-GCCGCAAGGCGAGAGCTGC-3′ specific for the 5′ end of Hu-IFN-αR2 cDNA (Novick et al., 63Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar); and λpCEV15 vector primer 5′-AGATCTAAGCTTGGCCGAGG-3′. For the second round we used the same 5′ primer and primer 5′-GCGGAATTCTTAATCACTGGGGCACAG-3′ specific for the 3′ end (bases 1204-1222) of Hu-IFN-αR2 cDNA (boldface) containing an EcoRI site within the primer. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI restriction endonuclease and ligated into EcoRI and blunt ended BamHI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. The expression vector was designated pαR2. To isolate the Hu-CRFB4 cDNA an oligonucleotide 5′-GTCCATGGCGTGGAGCCTTGGGAG-3′ homologous to the 5′ end of Hu-CRFB4 cDNA (Lutfalla et al., 51Lutfalla G. Gardiner K. Uzé G. Genomics. 1993; 16: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was labeled with [α-32P]dATP with terminal deoxynucleotide transferase to a specific activity of 5 × 106 cpm/µg. It was used to screen about 106 phages from the human M426 cell library (Miki et al., 57Miki T. Matsui T. Heidaran M.A. Aaronson S.A. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two positive clones were purified and plasmids were rescued from these two λ phages. The CRFB4 cDNA was released from one of the rescued plasmids designated pCEV15-CRFB4-1 by digestion with ThaI and SalI restriction endonucleases and cloned into EcoRV and XhoI sites of the pcDNAIneo vector (Invitrogen). The expression vector for the Hu-CRFB4 chain was designated pCRF. The vector expressing the chimeric receptor Hu-IFN-γR2/Hu-IFN-γR1 (γR2/γR1) was constructed as followed. The asymmetric PCR reaction was performed with a specific primer 5′-GATGCCTCCACTGAGCTTCAGCAACTTTGGATTCCAGTTGTTGC-3′ and 100-fold excess of T7 primer with plasmids pHu-IFN-γR8 (the Hu-IFN-γR1 cDNA) and pγR2 as templates in the same reaction mixture. The second round of the PCR was performed with the set of primers 5′-GACCCTCTTTCCCAGCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCCACACATCCTCTTTACGC-3′ with 1 µl of PCR reaction mixture from the first round of PCR as template. The final γR2/γR1 PCR product was digested with BstEII restriction endonuclease and cloned into BstEII and blunt-ended XbaI sites of the pγR2 plasmid. The expression vector was designated pγR2/γR1. To introduce an NheI site in the beginning of the transmembrane domain of the Hu-IFN-γR2 cDNA clone, the PCR reaction was performed with two primers 5′-GCCTTTTTTAGTTATTATGTC-3′ and 5′-ATCGCTAGCCATTGCTGAAGCTCAGTGGAGG-3′ and plasmid pγR2 as a template according to a standard protocol (Sambrook et al., 70Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PCR product was digested with BstXI restriction endonuclease and ligated into BstXI and EcoRV sites of the pγR2. The plasmid was designated pγR2NheI. To construct chimeras Hu-IFN-γR2/Hu-IFN-αR1, Hu-IFN-γR2/Hu-IFN-αR2, and Hu-IFN-γR2/CRFB4 the PCR reactions were performed with SP6 primer and 5′-GTGGCTAGCTATAGTTGGAATTTGTATTGC-3′, 5′-GTGGCTAGCATAATTACTGTGTTTTTGAT-3′, or 5′-GTGGCTAGCCGTCATCCTCATGGCCTCG-3′ primers with plasmids pαR1, pαR2, or pCRF, respectively, as templates. The Hu-IFN-αR1 and Hu-IFN-αR2 PCR products were digested with NheI and ApaI restriction endonucleases and ligated into NheI and ApaI sites of the pγR2NheI. The CRFB4 PCR product was digested with NheI and XbaI restriction endonucleases and ligated into NheI and XbaI sites of the plasmid pγR2NheI. The plasmids were designated pγR2/αR1, pγR2/αR2, and pγR2/CRF, respectively. To create chimera Hu-IFN-γR2/IL-2RγC, the γC chain of IL-2R (Takeshita et al., 82Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N. Kumaki S. Tanaka N. Munakata H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Science. 1992; 257: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR as follows. The first strand cDNA synthesis in reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with poly(dT)18 primer with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with total RNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes as template. Two PCR rounds were performed. The primers 5′-CGGTTCAGGAACAATCGG-3′ and 5′-CAAGCGCCATGTTGAAGCC-3′ were used for the first round. For the second round the PCR product from the first round was diluted 100-fold and used as a template for the second round with primers 5′-GTTAGTACCACTTAGGGC-3′ and 5′-GTGGCTAGCATGGGAAGCCGTGGTTATC-3′. The IL-2RγC PCR product was digested with NheI restriction endonuclease and ligated into the NheI and blunt ended XbaI sites of plasmid pγR2NheI. The resultant expression vector was designated pγR2/γC. The nucleotide sequences of the modified regions of all the constructs were verified in their entirety. The 16-9 hamster × human somatic cell hybrid line is the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO-K1) hybrid containing a translocation of the long arm of human chromosome 6 encoding the HUIFNGR1 (Hu-IFN-γR1) gene and a transfected human HLA-B7 gene (Soh et al., 76Soh J.

The 16-9 cells were maintained in F-12 (Ham's) medium (Sigma) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) (complete F-12 medium). HEp-2 cells, a human epidermoid larynx carcinoma cell line, and COS-1 cells, a SV40 transformed fibroblast-like simian cell line, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The 16-9 cells were stably transfected with the expression vectors (1-3 µg of super-coiled plasmid DNA per 105-106 cells) with LipofectAMINE™ Reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions for stable transfection of adherent cells. For cotransfection we used 1-3 µg of plasmid DNA with the neoR gene and a 10-fold excess of plasmid DNA without neoR gene per 105-106 cells. All cell lines transfected with plasmids carrying the neoR gene were selected and maintained in complete F-12 medium containing 450 µg/ml antibiotic G418. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vectors by the DEAE-dextran procedure with dimethyl sulfoxide shock (Seed and Aruffo, 72Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The site binding enthalpies, ΔHb, with the exception of Me-α-DNS-GalN, are the same at both temperatures and range from −47.1 ± 1.0 kJ mol−1 for N-acetyllactosamine to −4.4 ± 0.3 kJ mol−1 for fucose, and the site binding constants range from 3.82 ± 0.9 × 105M−1 for Me-α-DNS-GalN at 283.2 K to 0.46 ± 0.05 × 103M−1 for fucose at 297.2 K. The binding reactions are mainly enthalpically driven except for fucose and exhibit enthalpy-entropy compensation. The binding enthalpies of the disaccharides are about twice the binding enthalpies of the monosaccharides in contrast to concanavalin A where the binding enthalpies do not double for the disaccharides. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements show that denaturation of the ECorL dimer results in dissociation into its monomer subunits. The binding constants from the increase in denaturation temperature of ECorL in the presence of saccharides are in agreement with values from isothermal titration calorimetry results. The thermal denaturation of ECorL occurs around 333 K, well below the 344-360 K denaturation temperature of other legume lectins of similar size and tertiary structure, undoubtedly due to the difference in its quaternary structure relative to other legume lectins. This is also apparent from the independent unfolding of its two domains.

This is also apparent from the independent unfolding of its two domains. Lectins are proteins that bind carbohydrates with a high degree of specificity which makes them useful as probes for carbohydrate structure in various biological systems, such as cell membranes, and as model systems for elucidating protein-carbohydrate interactions (Goldstein and Hayes, 9Goldstein I.J. Hayes C.E. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1978; 35: 127-340Google Scholar; Sharon and Lis, 28Sharon N. Lis H. Lectins. Chapman & Hall, New York1989Google Scholar). Previous investigations of the binding thermodynamics of the lectins with monosaccharides have shown that these reactions are enthalpically driven with little increase in the heat capacity change and that they exhibit enthalpy-entropy compensation (Schwarz et al., 23Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24344-24350Google Scholar, 24Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Bhat R. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7668-7677Google Scholar). These characteristics have also been observed for the binding of the trisaccharide methyl 3,6-di-O-(α-D-mannopyranosyl)-α-D-mannopyranoside to concanavalin A (Williams et al., 31Williams B.A. Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22907-22911Google Scholar) as well as for the binding of derivatives of galactose and lactose to the 14-kDa S-type lectin from sheep spleen (Ramkumar et al., 18Ramkumar R. Surolia A.

Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Google Scholar; Sharon, 27Sharon N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 221-226Google Scholar). Like other legume lectins it contains one atom of Mn2+ and of Ca2+ in each subunit that are essential for its carbohydrate binding activity (Lis et al., 14Lis H. Joubert F.J. Sharon N. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 2803-2809Google Scholar). However, each subunit is glycosylated by two N-linked oligosaccharides (Young et al., 34Young N.M. Watson D.C. Yaguchi M. Adar R. Arango R. Rodriguez-Arango E. Sharon N. Blay P.K.S. Thibault P. J. Biol.

In this investigation, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed to determine the thermodynamics of the carbohydrate-ECorL binding reaction in terms of the site binding constant (Kb) and changes in the free energy (ΔG0b), the binding enthalpy (ΔHb), and the binding entropy (ΔSb). In addition, the structural stability, particularly the effect of its unusual mode of dimerization as well as that of ligand binding on the thermal stability of ECorL, was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Previous DSC studies on the unfolding of concanavalin A, pea lectin, and lentil lectin (Schwarz et al., 24Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Bhat R. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7668-7677Google Scholar) have shown that the concanavalin A tetramer dissociates into monomers while the pea and lentil lectin dimers dissociate into submonomer fragments. An earlier DSC study (Schwarz et al., 23Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24344-24350Google Scholar) showed that, unlike the single transition exhibited by these lectins, denaturation of the basic lectin from winged bean consists of two transitions, with the higher temperature transition resulting in dissociation of the lectin dimer. Gal, Me-β-Gal, Lac, LacNAc, GalNAc, and fucose were obtained from Sigma 2Certain commercial equipment, instruments, and materials are identified in this paper in order to specify the experimental procedure as completely as possible.

The 2′-FL was a product of Dextra Laboratories, U. K., and Me-α-DNS-GalN was a gift of Dr. Willy Kinzy of Ciba-Geigy, Basel (Kinzy et al., 10Kinzy W.R. Belenky D.M. Loontiens F.G. Sharon N. Glycoconj. J. 1992; 9: 225-227Google Scholar). ECorL was prepared and purified to >98 purity as described (Lis et al., 14Lis H. Joubert F.J. Sharon N. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 2803-2809Google Scholar). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed according to Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) showed only one band with an Mr of 30,000. Deionized double-distilled water was used for all the solutions. All the other chemicals used were of the highest purity available. The ECorL solutions were prepared in the 0.02 M sodium phosphate and 0.15 M sodium chloride buffer at pH 7.4 (phosphate-buffered saline) by weight, dialyzed overnight against a large volume of the same buffer, and centrifuged to remove any insoluble material. The concentrations of the protein solutions were determined from extinction coefficient of ECorL i.e. A1280 nm = 15.3 (De Bock et al., 6DeBock H. Loontiens F.G. Lis H. Sharon N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 297-304Google Scholar). Solutions of the carbohydrates were prepared by weight in the dialysate to minimize differences between the protein buffer solution and ligand buffer solution in the ITC measurements. For DSC measurements, sugars (mg quantities) were added directly to 1.18 g of the lectin solution in the DSC cell (1.18 ml). The titration calorimetry measurements were performed with a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter as described previously by Wiseman et al. (32Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Google Scholar) and Schwarz et al. (23Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24344-24350Google Scholar). Aliquots of the ligand solution at 10-20 × the site concentration were added via a 250-µl rotating stirrer-syringe to the solution cell containing 1.34 ml of the 0.4-0.9 mM protein solution. The heat of dilution was determined to be negligible in separate titrations of the ligand solution into just the buffer solution. An identical site model, utilizing a site concentration = 2[ECorL], was the simplest binding model found to provide the best fit to the ITC data. A molecular mass of 57,500 Da was used for the ECorL dimer (Young et al., 34Young N.M. Watson D.C. Yaguchi M. Adar R. Arango R. Rodriguez-Arango E. Sharon N. Blay P.K.S. Thibault P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2563-2570Google Scholar). The total heat content, Qt, is related to the total ligand concentration, [L]t, via the following equation (Wiseman et al., 32Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Google Scholar), Qt=2n[ECorL]tΔHbV{1+[L]t/2n[ECorL]t+1/2nKb[ECorL]t−[(1+[L]t2n[ECorL]tV+1/2nKb[ECorL]t)2−4[L]t/2n[ECorL]t]1/2}/2(Eq. 1) where n is the stoichiometry, and V is the cell volume. The expression for the heat released per the ith injection, ΔQ(i), is then (Yang, 33Yang C.P. Omega Data in Origin. Microcal Inc., Northhampton, MA1990: 66Google Scholar) ΔQ(1)=ΔQ(i)+dVi/2V[Q(i)+Q(i−1)]−Q(i−1)(Eq. 2) where dVi is the volume of titrant added to the solution. The thermodynamic quantities, ΔG0b and ΔSb, were obtained from the basic equation of thermodynamics, ΔGb0=ΔHb−TΔSb(Eq. 3a) where ΔGb0=nRTln{Kb}(Eq. 3b) and n = number of moles, T is the absolute temperature, and R = 8.3151 J mol−1 K−1. DSC measurements were performed with a Microcal MC-2 DSC heat conduction scanning microcalorimeter which consists of two fixed 1.18-ml cells, a reference cell and a solution cell. The measurements were done usually at a scan rate of 20 Kh−1. To determine any dependence of the parameters on scan rate, they were also performed at 45 and 90 Kh−1. The best least squares fit of the two-state transition model, A ⇆ nB, where A is the folded state and B is the unfolded state, to the data was obtained with n = 2 by the EXAM Program (Schwarz and Kirchhoff, 22Schwarz F.P. Kirchhoff W.H. Thermochim. Acta. 1988; 128: 267-295Google Scholar). This program utilizes a sigmoidal base line to yield a van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔHv), a transition temperature (Tm, the temperature at half the peak area), and the transition peak area when divided by the number of moles of protein in the cell yields the calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHc). The ratio of ΔHc/ΔHv yields the cooperativity of the transition. Tp is the temperature where the transition peak is at maximum. The results of a typical titration calorimetry measurement for ECorL together with a least squares fit of the data to the identical site model described by Equation 2 is presented in Fig. 1. The close fit of the data to the identical site model shows that the ligand binds to each of the two sites of ECorL independently and with the same binding constant and enthalpy. The results of the carbohydrate-ECorL titrations at two different temperatures are presented in Table I. The binding reactions are mostly enthalpically driven with the exception of fucose which is mainly entropically driven. Values for ΔHb range from −47.1 kJ mol−1 for N-acetyllactosamine to −4.4 kJ mol−1 for fucose and each ligand, with the exception of Me-α-DNS-GalN, is within the experimental error at both temperatures. Thus, there is very little dependence of the binding enthalpies on temperature over this temperature range. Values for Kb change by a factor of 500 between Me-α-DNS-GalN where Kb = 3.81 × 105M−1 and fucose where Kb = 0.46 × 103M−1. Calculated values of the binding enthalpy from the van't Hoff equation, ln{Kb(T)/Kb(T0)}=−ΔHbv[1/T0−1/T]/R(Eq. 5) were in good agreement with the ITC binding enthalpies for Lac, GalNAc, and Me-β-Gal (Table I). The calculated van't Hoff enthalpies for 2′-fucosyllactose, N-acetyllactosamine, galactose, Me-α-Gal, and fucose differed substantially from the ITC binding enthalpies. Such differences between the ITC binding enthalpies and van't Hoff enthalpies are not uncommon and have been discussed in detail by Naghibi et al. (16Naghibi H. Tamura A. Sturtevant J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; : 5597-5599Google Scholar). Contributions of TΔSb to the binding reactions are negative with the exception of the binding of galactose, Me-α-DNS-GalN, and fucose. The binding reactions also exhibit enthalpy-entropy compensation (Fig. 2).Table I.Thermodynamic quantities of carbohydrate binding to ECorL in phosphate-buffered saline at pH=7.4LigandTaT, error in the temperatures is +0.1.Kb−ΔG0b−ΔH0b−ΔSbK×103 liter mol−1kJ mol−1kJ mol−1J mol−1 K−1LacNac283.217.5 ±0.923.0 ±0.146.1 ±3.081.3 ±9.5299.09.73 ±0.622.7 ±0.147.1 ±2.683.2 ±9.5ΔHbvbT, the ΔHbv values were calculated from Equation 1 in the text.=−27.7±2.0kJ mol−1Average values:46.6 ±0.582.3 ±1.0Lac285.74.05 ±0.2419.7 ±0.143.4 ±2.682.7 ±9.1298.01.94 ±0.1218.8 ±0.141.2 ±2.575.4 ±8.4ΔHbv=−42.5±0.4kJ mol−1Average values:42.3 ±1.179.0 ±3.62′-FL283.27.14 ±0.2820.9 ±0.116.2 ±0.8−16.6 ±2.0298.23.65 ±0.2320.3 ±0.118.0 ±0.9−7.7 ±1.2ΔHbv=−31.4±2.5kJ mol−1Average values:17.1 ±0.9−12.2 ±4.4GalNAc286.72.32 ±0.1918.5 ±0.223.4 ±1.617.2 ±5.6298.21.34 ±0.1117.9 ±0.223.0 ±1.617.1 ±5.3ΔHbv=−15.2±1.7kJ mol−1Average values:23.2 ±0.217.1 ±0.1Gal286.02.41 ±0.1918.5 ±0.214.9 ±1.0−12.5 ±3.6298.21.57 ±0.1318.2 ±0.213.7 ±1.0−15.3 ±3.4ΔHbv=−24.7±2.7kJ mol−1Average values:14.3 ±0.6−13.9 ±1.4Me-α-Gal285.51.50 ±0.1217.4 ±0.222.0 ±1.516.2 ±5.3297.61.40 ±0.1218.1 ±0.221.6 ±1.512.0 ±5.0ΔHbv=−10.0±1.1kJ mol−1Average values:21.8 ±0.214.1 ±2.1Me-β-Gal285.50.932 ±0.07516.2 ±0.220.6 ±1.415.2 ±5.0297.20.720 ±0.05816.3 ±0.218.2 ±1.36.6 ±4.4ΔHbv=−15.2±1.7kJ mol−1Average values:19.4 ±1.210.9 ±3.3Me-α-DNS-GalN283.2381.1 ±10.030.5 ±1.218.5 ±0.6−42.4 ±0.7298.2351.5 ±12.031.7 ±1.323.1 ±0.7−30.0 ±0.8D-Fucose283.20.58 ±0.0615.0 ±2.04.1 ±0.4−38.5 ±5.0297.20.46 ±0.0515.2 ±2.04.7 ±0.4−35.2 ±4.0ΔHbv=−10.9±1.1kJ mol−1Average values:4.4 ±0.3−36.9 ±1.7a T, error in the temperatures is +0.1.b T, the ΔHbv values were calculated from Equation 1 in the text.

Assuming this increase to be linear with temperature, the heat capacity change (d(ΔHb)/dT) for this binding reaction is −0.31 ± 0.04 kJ mol−1 K−1. Since the binding constants were determined only at two temperatures and an additional heat capacity term must be included in Equation 4, a van't Hoff binding enthalpy could not be calculated for Me-α-DNS-GalN with certainty. A typical DSC scan of ECorL is shown in Fig. 3 along with the fit of the single transition peak data to the A2⇌ 2B two-state transition model. The peak did not reappear upon a re-scan of the sample indicating that the transition is irreversible. Results of the fit of the transition peak data to the two-state transition model are presented in Table II. Although the results at higher scan rates exhibit a slight transition dependence of Tm and Tp on the scan rate, the thermodynamic quantities, ΔHv and ΔHc, are independent of scan rate. Since the temperature increase is only about 2-3 K in increasing the scan rate by more than a factor of 4 and ΔHv and ΔHc for the transitions are the same, the equilibrium two-state transition model was applied to these transitions instead of the irreversible model of Sanchez-Ruiz (19Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Google Scholar). This analysis of the irreversible ECorL transitions in terms of a thermodynamic model is based on treating them as a sequence of two processes; the reversible unfolding of the protein described by the unfolding temperature and the calorimetric enthalpy followed by a slower irreversible process such as aggregation. This approach yields results for the overall process that are the same as for the reversible process (Manly et al., 15Manly S.P. Matthews K.S.M. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3842-3846Google Scholar). In Table II, the ratio ΔHc/ΔHv is close to 2 indicating that two domains are unfolding independently during denaturation. Since the shape of the transition peak indicates that the domains unfold at the same temperature, it is attractive to identify each domain with the lectin subunit and assume that as both subunits unfold they dissociate. Thus, in the unfolded conformation ECorL exists as two separate monomers whereas in the folded state it exists as a dimer. This is further substantiated by the increase of Tm and Tp with increase in the protein concentration. It has been shown that for the denaturation of an oligomer followed by dissociation into its monomers this dependence is given by the following equation from Fukada et al. (8Fukada H. Sturtevant J.M. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13193-13198Google Scholar), lnAn=−ΔHv(S)/{RTp(n−1)}+constant(Eq. 6) where n is the number of subunits in the oligomer, [An] is the concentration of the protein oligomer in the native state, and ΔHv(S) is a van't Hoff enthalpy obtained from the slope of ln[An] versus 1/Tp. A plot of this dependence is shown in Fig. 4 and the slope of the plot for n = 2 yields ΔHs(S) = 665 ± 182 kJ mol−1 which is the same as ΔHv for the transition. It should be emphasized that Tp is not determined from fits of the two-state transition model to the data, and, thus, the agreement between ΔHv and ΔHv(S) is independent confirmation that denaturation of ECorL results in dissociation. DSC scans of ECorL in the presence of saturating amounts of carbohydrate ligands exhibit a single transition that is best fitted to a A2⇌ 2B two-state transition model as in the absence of the ligand. The results fitting the model to the DSC data for the unfolding of ECorL in the presence of N-acetyllactosamine, lactose and galactose, Me-α-Gal, and Me-β-Gal are presented in Table III. Tm and Tp increase with ligand concentration, whereas ΔHv and ΔHc remain the same. The increase in both Tm and Tp with ligand concentration arises from preferential binding of the ligand to the lectin in the folded form. The denaturation transition in the presence of bound ligand can be expressed as follows, A2Lm=2B+mL(Eq. 7) and at constant lectin concentration, ln[L]={−ΔHv(L)/RTpm}+constant.(Eq. 8) Plots of ln[L] versus 1/Tp are shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, and the best fits of ln[L] to 1/Tp yield values with m = 2 for ΔHv(L) close to ΔHv and ΔHc as shown in Table III. Thus, one carbohydrate ligand binds to each of the two monomer units of ECorL. It has been shown (Schwarz, 21Schwarz F.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8429-8436Google Scholar) that the increase in the transition temperature with ligand concentration at [L]>>>[Protein] depends on Kb at the denaturation temperature and that Kb(Tm) can be determined from this increase. For ligand dissociation from the two independent, identical sites of a protein upon denaturation, Schellman (20Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 999-1018Google Scholar) showed that the free energy of binding at the Tm of a ligated protein, Tl, is ΔG(T1)/RT1=−ln{1+Kb[L]}2={(T1−Tm)ΔHc(Tc)/RT1Tm}(Eq. 9) so that Kb(T1)=[exp{(T1−Tm)ΔHc(Tc)/2.0RT1Tm}−1]/[L],(Eq. 10) where [L], the free ligand concentration, is approximated as the difference between the total ligand concentration and 2 × the protein concentration.

It consists of a shallow depression on the surface of the protein that shares residues with a calcium binding site (Shaanan et al., 26Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Google Scholar). However, concanavalin A and pea lectin are specific for manno- and glucopyranoside derivatives where C4-OH is equatorial whereas ECorL is specific for galactopyranoside derivatives where the C4-OH is axial. In addition to the predominance of the usual hydrogen bonds between a carbohydrate and the lectin, hydrophobic interactions have also been identified for galactose binding to ECorL and involve Ala-88, Tyr-106, Phe-131, and Ala-218 at the binding site (Shaanan et al., 26Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Google Scholar). Galactose in ECorL specifically stacks on Phe-131 just as mannose stacks on a tyrosine in concanavalin A. Hydrophobic interactions with concanavalin A and pea lectin have also been identified for the phenyl group of phenyl α-glucopyranoside and the methyl group of 3-O-methyl glucose (Schwarz et al., 25Schwarz F.P. Misquith S. Surolia A. Biochem. J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Differences in the specificity of ECorL arise from rotation of galactose so that its C3-OH and C4-OH groups hydrogen bond to Asn-133 and Asp-89, whereas the equivalent residues in concanavalin A and pea lectin hydrogen bond to the C4-OH and C6-OH groups of the pyranose ring (Shaanan et al., 26Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Google Scholar; Adar and Sharon, 2Adar R. Sharon N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Observation of enthalpy-entropy compensation is not surprising as thermodynamic studies on several lectins strongly emphasize the importance of water as a mediator in protein-carbohydrate recognition (Lemieux et al., 13Lemieux R.U. Spohr U. Acharya S. Surolia A. Can. J. Chem. 1994; 72: 158-163Google Scholar; Puri and Surolia, 17Puri K.D. Surolia A. Pure Appl. Chem. 1994; 66: 497-502Google Scholar; Toone, 29Toone E.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 719-728Google Scholar; Ramkumar et al., 18Ramkumar R. Surolia A. Podder S.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 237-241Google Scholar). This fact is also succinctly brought out by the high resolution structural analysis of Lathyrus ochrus lectin I complexed with its complementary oligosaccharide ligand (Bourne et al., 4Bourne Y. Rouge P. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 197-203Google Scholar). Other factors, although less likely, such as subtle shifts in protein conformational states cannot be ignored as a source of the observed enthalpy-entropy compensation (Eftink et al., 7Eftink M.R. Anusiem A.C. Biltonen R.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3884-3896Google Scholar). The binding reactions are predominantly enthalpically driven, and entropy-enthalpy compensation is observed. Therefore, differences in the binding affinities can be discussed in terms of differences in the binding enthalpies if it is assumed that the initial interaction of the isolated saccharide ligands with surrounding water molecules is the same for all the ligands. The binding enthalpies of N-acetyllactosamine, Me-α-Gal, and Me-β-Gal are all close to −20 kJ mol−1 whereas that of galactose is −14 kJ mol−1. A similar stronger interaction between concanavalin A and manno- and glucopyranose is observed upon converting the OH of C1 to OCH3 (Schwarz et al., 24Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Bhat R. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7668-7677Google Scholar). Possible hydrophobic interactions between the C1 methoxy groups and the neighboring aromatic ring of Tyr-12 in concanavalin A and Phe-123 in pea lectin could account for a stronger interaction with these derivatives. Despite the proximity of the Phe-131 aromatic ring and Ala-218 in ECorL to C1 of galactose in the binding site, such hydrophobic interactions with this lectin appear less tenacious as compared with concanavalin A. Binding of fucose, which has a methyl group at its C5 position instead of a hydroxymethyl group at the equivalent carbon of the galactose, suggests that C5 substituent of galactose is primarily involved in van der Waals interaction with the lectin. The fact that N-acetylgalactosamine is as potent a ligand as galactose indicates that an acetamido group at C2-OH of the latter does not interfere with the interaction with the ECorL (Kinzy et al., 10Kinzy W.R. Belenky D.M. Loontiens F.G. Sharon N. Glycoconj. J. 1992; 9: 225-227Google Scholar). Addition of L-fucose to lactose as in 2′-fucosyllactose enhances the binding affinity due to a favorable entropic contribution. In 2′-fucosyllactose, perhaps the L-fucose residue at the C2 of galactose encounters a hydrophobic locus in the binding site of ECorL. This is not surprising as L-fucose differs from other pyranoses in having a 1C4 configuration, and the surface presented by its C4 and C5 region of the molecule is distinctly nonpolar and might abut to within 3.5 Å of Trp-135, Tyr-106, and Tyr-108 side chains in the binding site. Likewise, the strong and entropically driven nature of the binding of Me-α-DNS-GalN to EcorL also appears to be due to enhanced nonpolar contacts (<3 Å) between the aromatic dansyl moiety at C2 of the ligand and Trp-135 in the binding site of ECorL. The contribution of nonpolar contacts in the interaction between Me-α-DNS-GalN and ECorL is further evident in the negative heat capacity change observed for this interaction. For the disaccharides, the binding enthalpy to ECorL (Table I) increases by a factor of 2 upon the addition of glucopyranoside to the galactopyranose to form lactose, in contrast to the binding enthalpies of the dimannopyranosides to concanavalin A which are the same as for mannopyranose (Van Landschoot et al., 30Van Landschoot A. Loontiens F.G. DeBruyne C.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 307-312Google Scholar; Williams et al., 31Williams B.A. Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22907-22911Google Scholar). Since crystal structures of both lectins show that the second pyranoside ring projects out of the pocket into the solvent for ECorL (Shaanan et al., 26Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Google Scholar) and presumably also for concanavalin A, the binding interaction should be the same for both the mono- and disaccharide as is observed for the concanavalin A complex. Closer inspection of the structure of the ECorL complex indicates an additional possible hydrogen bond formation between the glucopyranoside ring and Gln-219 (Adar and Sharon, 2Adar R. Sharon N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar) which would account for a small negative increase in ΔHb but not a doubling of the binding enthalpy. Since, in the crystal structure of the Lac-ECorL complex, there are three localized water molecules trapped between the glucopyranoside ring and the surface surrounding the binding cavity, it is possible that a network of hydrogen bonds involving these water molecules between the glucopyranoside moiety of lactose and the surface of ECorL could account for this enhanced binding interaction. Such networks of water-mediated hydrogen bonds seem to account for the large binding enthalpy (−90 kJ mol−1) between lysozyme antigen and the D1.3 IgG antibody binding site (Bhat et al., 3Bhat T.N. Bentley G.A. Boulot G. Greene M.I. Tello D. Dall'Acqua W. Souchon H. Schwarz F.P. Mariuzza R. Poljak R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1089-1093Google Scholar) relative to the enthalpy change of −39.4 kJ mol−1 for lysozyme binding to the D44.1 IgG which has only a few less water molecules in the binding interface (Braden et al., 5Braden B.C. Souchon H. Eisele J.-L. Bentley G.A. Bhat T.N. Navaza J. Poljak R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 767-781Google Scholar). There is also a marked enhancement in the binding interaction with the acetamido derivative of lactose, namely N-acetyllactosamine, which would further promote water-mediated hydrogen bonding at this interface in addition to the enhanced interactions between its acetamido group and Gln-219 residue in the combining site of ECorL. The importance of water molecules in the binding interaction between ECorL and the disaccharides is also evident by the fact that there is a net uptake of 2-3 additional water molecules upon binding of lactose and N-acetyllactosamine as compared with that observed for galactose or Me-β-Gal. 3C. P. Swaminathan and A. Surolia, unpublished observations. Thermal denaturation results in dissociation of the ECorL dimer into its two monomer subunits. Dissociation into monomeric units is also observed for the concanavalin A tetramer (Schwarz et al., 24Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Bhat R. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7668-7677Google Scholar). The ratio of ΔHc/ΔHv of 2 indicates that two domains of the protein unfold independently with the subsequent dissociation of the protein. This is similar to the basic lectin from winged bean (Schwarz et al., 23Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24344-24350Google Scholar) where two domains unfold independently, but at different temperatures, and dissociate into two subunits. Although the monomeric units of concanavalin A have a similar molecular mass and tertiary structure as ECorL (Shaanan et al., 26Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Google Scholar), the thermal denaturation of ECorL occurs at 333 K whereas that of concanavalin A occurs at 363 K (Schwarz et al., 24Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Bhat R. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7668-7677Google Scholar) reflecting the much greater stability of the latter. The structures of the pea and lentil lectins also exhibit greater stability than that of ECorL. The greater stability of concanavalin A is also reflected in the ΔHc/ΔHv ratio of 1 indicating that concanavalin A tetramer unfolds as a single entity because of strong interactions between the subunits. On the other hand, ECorL where the contact region at monomer-monomer interface (700 Å) is smaller than in concanavalin A (1000 A) (Shaanan et al., 26Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Google Scholar) exhibits independent unfolding of two identical domains which may be identified as its monomer subunits. This difference in the stability thus results from the difference in the quaternary structure of ECorL induced by the bulky carbohydrate protruding from Asn-17 (Shaanan et al., 26Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Google Scholar). Therefore, the mode of dimerization in legume lectins seems to have a profound consequence on their thermal stability as well as the mode of their thermal unfolding. We thank N. G. Srinivas and C. P. Swaminathan for collecting some of the data and Dr. W. Kinzy for a gift of Me-α-DNS-GalN."

https://openalex.org/W2049908702,"Refolding of proteins at high concentrations often results in aggregation. To gain insight into the molecular aspects of refolding and to improve the yield of active protein, we have studied the refolding of lysozyme either from its denatured state or from its denatured/reduced state. Refolding of denatured lysozyme, even at 1 mg/ml, yields fully active enzyme without aggregation. However, refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme into buffer that lacks thiol/disulfide reagents leads to aggregation. Thiol/disulfide redox reagents such as cysteine/cystine and reduced/oxidized glutathione facilitate the renaturation, with the yield depending on their absolute concentrations. We have obtained an ∼70% renaturation yield upon refolding of lysozyme at 150 µg/ml. The cysteine/cystine redox system is more efficient compared with the glutathione redox system. When lysozyme is refolded in the absence of redox reagents, a transient intermediate that has regained a significant amount of secondary structure is formed. The tryptophans in this intermediate are as exposed to water as in the fully unfolded protein.

INTRODUCTIONUnderstanding molecular details of the formation of functional three-dimensional structures, from the one-dimensional information contained in the genetic material, is still one of the major challenges of biology. Anfinsen (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5076) Google Scholar), 3 decades ago, showed that the amino acid sequence dictates the three-dimensional native structure of a protein. Since then, there has been significant progress, particularly due to the availability of recombinant DNA technology tools. Under conditions favoring folding, unfolded states of a protein rapidly (10-50 ms) collapse to a compact-intermediate state, briefly visiting other intermediate states en route (2Creighton T.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 3Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 645-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Such a compact-intermediate state, termed molten globule (3Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 645-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 84-91Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5Kuwajima K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 6Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is believed to adopt much of the secondary structure of the native protein, to be compact with respect to the unfolded states, and to possess little or no tertiary structure. Conversion of the compact-intermediate state to the native structure determines the overall rate of folding of a protein. Most of the partially folded states, including the molten-globule state, expose hydrophobic surfaces and have a tendency to aggregate or to interact with hydrophobic surfaces in general. Molecular chaperones provide proper hydrophobic surfaces to interact with such partially folded states of proteins, prevent aggregation, and help in proper folding of proteins (2Creighton T.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 7Hartl F.U. Martin J. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar).With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, it is now possible to express a gene of interest in a foreign cell and to translate it into a polypeptide chain. However, extensive production of functionally active protein has been limited due to the formation of protein aggregates or inclusion bodies (11Marston F.A.O. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 12Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1987; 49: 117-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies, aggregates of incompletely folded chains (13Haase-Pettingell C.A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4977-4983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are often partially or completely denatured using denaturants like urea and guanidine hydrochloride and then subjected to refolding (14Kane J.F. Hartley D.L. Trends Biotechnol. 1988; 6: 87-101Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (227) Google Scholar).Many proteins can be refolded properly without any external assistance at low concentrations. However, it is a common observation that the yield of renatured protein decreases when the concentration of the protein to be refolded increases (15Kumar T.K.S. Gopalakrishna K. Ramakrishna T. Pandit M.W. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1994; 16: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16Jaenicke R. Eur. J.

Kinetic competition between two types of interactions (interchain and intrachain) occurs during the refolding of a protein (20Zettlmeissl G. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5567-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 22Orsini G. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3453-3458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unimolecular intrachain interactions largely lead to the native state, while multimolecular interchain interactions would be expected to increase with the concentration of the refolding protein and therefore lead to misfolding and aggregation (21Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, the efficacy of refolding depends on the partitioning of the folding protein between productive pathways leading to the native state and nonproductive pathways leading to misfolding and aggregation. Studies on the kinetics of competition between renaturation and aggregation during the refolding of lysozyme have shown that aggregation occurs very early during refolding through nonspecific hydrophobic interactions (21Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).We have studied refolding of hen egg white lysozyme at high concentrations (at which earlier studies showed aggregation) using reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), cysteine/cystine, and reduced/oxidized dithiothreitol (DTT/ODTT) 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolODTToxidized dithiothreitolHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. redox systems. We have observed an intermediate in the refolding pathway of lysozyme possessing a significant amount of secondary structure and significantly higher exposed hydrophobic surfaces, which can be refolded to its active form in the presence of GSSG or cystine.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONLysozyme is one of the most extensively studied (21Goldberg M.E.

Biophys. 1993; 306: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As the concentration of the enzyme to be refolded increases, the renaturation yield drastically decreases due to misfolding or aggregation (21Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).We studied the refolding of denatured and denatured/reduced lysozyme at high concentrations. Refolding of denatured lysozyme even at 1 mg/ml does not result in any aggregation (Fig. 1A). Almost 100% activity of the enzyme is recovered (Fig. 1B). However, denatured/reduced lysozyme does not refold to its active form when the refolding buffer lacks thiol/disulfide reagents. Even at the lowest concentration studied (50 µg/ml), refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme results in aggregation as shown in Fig. 1A. Lysozyme is known to refold within a few seconds when the disulfide bonds are intact (32Kuwajima K. Hiraoka Y. Ikeguchi M. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), while it takes several minutes when the disulfide bonds are reduced (23Saxena V.P. Wetlaufer D.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 5015-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Goldberg and Guillou (33Goldberg M.E. Guillou Y. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have shown that a folding intermediate with substantial secondary structure is formed in 4 ms when denatured lysozyme is subjected to refolding, whereas the refolding of lysozyme under conditions that lead to reduction of its disulfide bonds does not exhibit any secondary structural formation in such a time scale. Our results show that denatured lysozyme refolds completely to its active state without any aggregation due to self-association even at concentrations as high as 1 mg/ml. Kumar et al. (15Kumar T.K.S. Gopalakrishna K. Ramakrishna T. Pandit M.W. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1994; 16: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) showed that the refolding of denatured but not reduced RNase A at a concentration as high as 20 mg/ml yielded a single peak in sedimentation analysis with s20,w similar to that of the native enzyme. Native lysozyme does not exhibit self-association at the concentration range used in the present study (35Wills P.R. Nichol L.W. Siezen R.J. Biophys. Chem. 1980; 11: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the constraints imposed by the disulfide bonds facilitate a faster rate of secondary structural formation, fewer intermolecular interactions, and productive folding of proteins.As we have mentioned above, refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme leads to aggregation of the protein. We studied the effect of thiol/disulfide redox reagents on the refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme at high concentrations. Fig. 2 shows the effect of absolute concentrations of GSH/GSSG or cysteine/cystine, maintaining a millimolar ratio of 10:1, on the refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme at 125 µg/ml. When the refolding buffer lacks these thiol/disulfide redox reagents (i.e. at the y intercept), the enzyme aggregates to a significant extent as measured by turbidity (Fig. 2A), and the renaturation yield is minimal (Fig. 2B). The percentage renaturation increases with the increase in concentration of thiol/disulfide reagents in the refolding medium (Fig. 2B). To measure the extent of aggregation, we monitored the absorbance at 450 nm as a measure of turbidity of the solutions. Fig. 2 shows that as the concentration of thiol/disulfide reagents increases, the extent of aggregation decreases with a concomitant increase in the percentage renaturation of the enzyme. Under the refolding conditions used in our studies, the DTT/ODTT system, however, did not facilitate renaturation of the enzyme (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme at 125 µg/ml in the presence of different concentrations of GSH and GSSG (○), cysteine and cystine (•), and DTT and ODTT (□).

The renaturation yield gradually decreases with an increase in the protein concentration. At the lowest concentration (50 µg/ml), we obtained 75% renaturation. Earlier studies with a much lower concentration of lysozyme (∼14 µg/ml) reported varying renaturation yields, ranging from 35 to 90%, employing different conditions of refolding. However, at concentrations >50 µg/ml, Goldberg et al. (21Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) reported a drastic drop in the renaturation yield; upon refolding lysozyme at 140 µg/ml, they obtained a renaturation yield of only 10%. In an enzyme-assisted folding process, Puig and Gilbert (36Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) obtained a renaturation yield of ∼60% upon refolding lysozyme at 10 µM (140 µg/ml) in the presence of 30 µM (1650 µg/ml) protein-disulfide isomerase, an enzyme found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (37Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Protein-disulfide isomerase catalyzes thiol/disulfide exchange reactions in the folding of disulfide-containing proteins (39Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used in the present study, we were able to obtain renaturation yields of ∼70% upon nonenzymatic refolding of lysozyme at concentration as high as 150 µg/ml (see Fig. 3).Fig. 3Refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme at different concentrations in the presence of 10 mM GSH and 1 mM GSSG (○) or 10 mM cysteine and 1 mM cystine (•). The concentrations indicated are the final concentrations of the protein obtained after dilution into the refolding medium. The percentage recovery of activity is with respect to the activity of the native enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We compared the effect of the GSH/GSSG redox system with that of the cysteine/cystine redox system on the refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). As evident from Figs. 2, 3, 4, the cysteine/cystine redox system appears to be more effective than the GSH/GSSG system under the conditions used. In contrast to our observation, Saxena and Wetlaufer (23Saxena V.P. Wetlaufer D.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 5015-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) found that several thiol/disulfide pairs had about the same efficiency, both in the rate of refolding and in the yield of active lysozyme. We believe that the reason for this difference lies in the concentration of the protein; they studied refolding of lysozyme at a low concentration (14 µg/ml), whereas we used higher concentrations. This is suggested by the data in Fig. 3; at 50 µg/ml, refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme either in 10 mM GSH, 1 mM GSSG or in 10 mM cysteine, 1 mM cystine results in similar renaturation yields (∼75%), whereas at higher concentrations of the protein, the difference in the renaturation yields for the two redox systems is quite significant. Therefore, in the present study, the refolding at higher concentrations of proteins probably differentiates the efficiency of these thiol/disulfide pairs. The reason for the higher efficiency of the cysteine/cystine system over the GSH/GSSG system, however, is not clear. It may be attributed to lesser net ionic charge and the smaller size of cysteine and cystine molecules, which enable these molecules to access the cysteine residues in the partially folded protein better in comparison with relatively highly charged, bulkier GSH and GSSG molecules.Fig. 4Refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme at 125 µg/ml in the presence of various concentrations of GSSG (○), cystine (•), and ODTT (□). The percentage recovery of activity is with respect to the activity of the native enzyme. [T] represents [GSSG], [cystine] or [ODTT].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is interesting to note that oxidized glutathione or cystine alone facilitates the refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme to a significant extent as shown in Fig. 4. However, the renaturation yield is very low at lower concentrations of GSSG and is more pronounced at higher concentrations (0.6-1 mM). We also observed that different ratios of oxidized to reduced glutathione have little effect on the renaturation yield of lysozyme (data not shown). These results suggest that redox potential does not affect significantly the refolding of lysozyme. This also suggests that breaking and remaking of disulfide bonds might not be a significant factor in the refolding of lysozyme under the conditions used.In the present study, we obtained almost 80% recovery of activity on refolding denatured/reduced lysozyme at 100 µg/ml; due to surface denaturation and adsorption of lysozyme on the surface of reaction tubes, some amount of protein is not recovered (36Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (in fact, we could observe a thin film of protein on the surface (air/water interface) of the refolded sample that could be removed by centrifugation). The high recovery of activity on refolding lysozyme at appropriate concentrations of thiol/disulfide reagents indicates the recovery of its native structure. We therefore studied the refolded lysozyme for its secondary structure. Fig. 5 shows the far-UV CD spectra of native and refolded lysozyme (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The far-UV CD spectrum of refolded lysozyme overlaps almost completely with that of native lysozyme within experimental error. The refolded enzyme also elutes with the same retention time as that of the native enzyme on reverse-phase HPLC as shown in Fig. 6. The intrinsic fluorescence of the refolded enzyme and its binding to the hydrophobic dye 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid are comparable to the native protein (see Fig. 9, Fig. 10). These results clearly demonstrate that the enzyme has almost completely regained its native structure.Fig. 5Far-UV CD spectra of native (––) and refolded (- - -) lysozyme and the intermediate (- · - ·).

Fig. 7 shows the percentage renaturation yield of lysozyme upon refolding at concentrations of 25 and 100 µg/ml in the presence of 10 mM GSH and 1 mM GSSG over a period of 50 min. It is interesting to note that the rate of refolding is relatively lower at the higher concentration of lysozyme.Fig. 7Kinetics of refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme at 25 (○) and 100 (•) µg/ml. The refolding medium contained 1 mM GSSG. The percentage recovery of activity is with respect to the activity of the native enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As mentioned above, higher concentrations of thiol/disulfide reagents suppress the aggregation and improve the renaturation yield in the refolding of proteins at higher concentrations. Thiol/disulfide redox reagents do not have any apparent apolar surfaces, and the mechanism of the observed suppression of aggregation of proteins by the thiol/disulfide reagents may not involve hydrophobic interactions. The kinetics of aggregation of denatured/reduced lysozyme upon refolding is shown in Fig. 8. The aggregation is minimum and negligible up to 5 min, and it increases more sharply afterwards. The aggregation is suppressed when the refolding medium contains cystine or GSSG (Fig. 8). This is perhaps due to increased partitioning into proper folding at the expense of the aggregation-prone intermediate.Fig. 8Kinetics of aggregation of denatured/reduced lysozyme upon refolding at 100 (- · - ·) and 125 (––) µg/ml in 0.1 M Tris acetate (pH 8.2) lacking redox reagents and in buffer containing 1 mM cystine (- - -). The extent of aggregation was measured as turbidity of the solutions. Turbidity was measured as the absorbance at 450 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The data in Fig. 8 show that aggregation is negligible in the first 5 min when lysozyme is refolded at 100 µg/ml in the absence of thiol/disulfide reagents. We therefore studied this sample before the aggregation process starts (between 2 and 5 min after initiation of refolding). The far-UV CD spectrum of this sample is shown in Fig. 5. It is evident from Fig. 5 that a significant amount of secondary structure is regained. Because of the low concentration of the protein sample (and pronounced aggregation observed at higher concentrations), we could not record the near-UV CD spectrum. However, the fluorescence spectrum of this sample shows an emission maximum of 348 nm; the fluorescence spectra of denatured and denatured/reduced protein show emission maxima of 350 nm, while native lysozyme shows an emission maximum of 337 nm (Fig. 9). This reveals that the tryptophans of the intermediate are exposed to water, similar to those of the unfolded protein. The hydrophobic dye 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid binds with much more avidity to this intermediate state (Fig. 10) than to the native, denatured/reduced, or refolded enzyme. We investigated whether this intermediate state can be directed to active enzyme upon addition of oxidized glutathione. Upon addition of GSSG to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubation for ∼3 h, almost 60% of the activity was regained. Thus, lysozyme in this state may be characterized as an intermediate in its refolding pathway. The fate of this intermediate depends on the relative rates of (i) aggregation and (ii) proper refolding. The latter process can be favored by the presence GSSG or cystine. Kuwajima et al. (32Kuwajima K. Hiraoka Y. Ikeguchi M. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) carried out kinetic studies using stop-flow CD on the refolding of lysozyme and the homologous protein α-lactalbumin at 4.5°C by measuring changes in the aromatic and peptide regions and observed a kinetic molten-globule intermediate. The native tertiary structure in both proteins was completely absent, while they had almost complete backbone secondary structure. The presence of a stable, partially folded, molten globule-like state, both for lysozyme and α-lactalbumin, has also been demonstrated during trifluoroethanol-induced unfolding (40Buck M. Radford S.E. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 41Alexandrescu A.T. Ng Y.-L. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The early intermediate obtained by us upon refolding lysozyme in the absence of redox reagents also possesses substantial secondary structure and exhibits intrinsic fluorescence similar to that of the fully unfolded protein. The binding of 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid to this intermediate is severalfold higher than that to the native or fully unfolded enzyme as usually observed for the molten-globule state (34Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.L. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). These properties of the intermediate are similar to those proposed for the molten-globule intermediate of proteins.We have demonstrated that denatured/reduced lysozyme can be refolded at high concentrations with good renaturation yields at appropriate concentrations of thiol/disulfide reagents in the refolding buffer. The cysteine/cystine redox system appears to be more efficient than the GSH/GSSG system. We have observed an intermediate, formed early during the refolding of lysozyme, before the pairing of disulfide bonds occurs that has properties similar to those of a molten globule. This intermediate is prone to aggregation, but in the presence of GSSG, can be refolded to active enzyme. These results should prove useful in understanding intermediates in the pathway of protein folding. INTRODUCTIONUnderstanding molecular details of the formation of functional three-dimensional structures, from the one-dimensional information contained in the genetic material, is still one of the major challenges of biology. Anfinsen (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5076) Google Scholar), 3 decades ago, showed that the amino acid sequence dictates the three-dimensional native structure of a protein. Since then, there has been significant progress, particularly due to the availability of recombinant DNA technology tools. Under conditions favoring folding, unfolded states of a protein rapidly (10-50 ms) collapse to a compact-intermediate state, briefly visiting other intermediate states en route (2Creighton T.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 3Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 645-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Such a compact-intermediate state, termed molten globule (3Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 645-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 84-91Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5Kuwajima K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 6Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is believed to adopt much of the secondary structure of the native protein, to be compact with respect to the unfolded states, and to possess little or no tertiary structure. Conversion of the compact-intermediate state to the native structure determines the overall rate of folding of a protein. Most of the partially folded states, including the molten-globule state, expose hydrophobic surfaces and have a tendency to aggregate or to interact with hydrophobic surfaces in general. Molecular chaperones provide proper hydrophobic surfaces to interact with such partially folded states of proteins, prevent aggregation, and help in proper folding of proteins (2Creighton T.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 7Hartl F.U. Martin J. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar).With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, it is now possible to express a gene of interest in a foreign cell and to translate it into a polypeptide chain. However, extensive production of functionally active protein has been limited due to the formation of protein aggregates or inclusion bodies (11Marston F.A.O. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 12Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1987; 49: 117-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies, aggregates of incompletely folded chains (13Haase-Pettingell C.A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4977-4983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are often partially or completely denatured using denaturants like urea and guanidine hydrochloride and then subjected to refolding (14Kane J.F. Hartley D.L. Trends Biotechnol. 1988; 6: 87-101Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (227) Google Scholar).Many proteins can be refolded properly without any external assistance at low concentrations. However, it is a common observation that the yield of renatured protein decreases when the concentration of the protein to be refolded increases (15Kumar T.K.S. Gopalakrishna K. Ramakrishna T. Pandit M.W. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1994; 16: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16Jaenicke R. Eur. J.

Kinetic competition between two types of interactions (interchain and intrachain) occurs during the refolding of a protein (20Zettlmeissl G. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5567-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 22Orsini G. Goldberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3453-3458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unimolecular intrachain interactions largely lead to the native state, while multimolecular interchain interactions would be expected to increase with the concentration of the refolding protein and therefore lead to misfolding and aggregation (21Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, the efficacy of refolding depends on the partitioning of the folding protein between productive pathways leading to the native state and nonproductive pathways leading to misfolding and aggregation. Studies on the kinetics of competition between renaturation and aggregation during the refolding of lysozyme have shown that aggregation occurs very early during refolding through nonspecific hydrophobic interactions (21Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).We have studied refolding of hen egg white lysozyme at high concentrations (at which earlier studies showed aggregation) using reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), cysteine/cystine, and reduced/oxidized dithiothreitol (DTT/ODTT) 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolODTToxidized dithiothreitolHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. redox systems. We have observed an intermediate in the refolding pathway of lysozyme possessing a significant amount of secondary structure and significantly higher exposed hydrophobic surfaces, which can be refolded to its active form in the presence of GSSG or cystine."

The precursor contains, in tandem, four glycoprotein activators or saposins, termed A, B, C, and D, that are essential for specific glycosphingolipid hydrolase activities. Prosaposin appears to be a potent neurotrophic factor. To explore the proteolytic processing from prosaposin to mature activator proteins, metabolic labeling was done with human prosaposin expressed in insect cells, human fibroblasts, neuronal stem cells (NT2) and retinoic acid-differentiated NT2 neurons. In all cell types, the major processing pathway was through a tetrasaposin, A-B-C-D, from which saposin A was then removed. In mammalian cells monosaposins were derived from the trisaposin B-C-D by cleavage to the disaposins, B-C and C-D, that were processed to monosaposins. In insect cells the major end products were the disaposins, with A-B and C-D derived from the tetrasaposin, A-B-C-D, or with B-C and C-D derived from the trisaposin, B-C-D. In insect and mammalian cells, the nonsignal NH2-terminal peptide preceding saposin A (termed Nter) was usually removed prior to saposin A cleavage. In NT2-derived differentiated neurons, precursor tetrasaposins containing A-B-C-D were secreted with and without Nter. Immunofluorescence studies using prosaposin-specific antisera showed large steady state amounts of uncleaved prosaposin in Purkinje cells, cortical neurons, and other specific cell types in adult mice.

https://openalex.org/W2038635132,"Members of the syntaxin gene family are components of protein complexes which regulate vesicle docking and/or fusion during transport of cargo through the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. We have previously demonstrated that syntaxin 5 is specifically required for endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport (Dascher, C., Matteson, J., and Balch, W. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29363-29366). To extend these observations we have now cloned a protein from rat liver membranes which forms a native complex with syntaxin 5. We demonstrate that this protein is the mammalian homologue to yeast Sly1p, previously identified as a protein which genetically and biochemically interacts with the small GTPase Ypt1p and Sed5p, proteins involved in docking/fusion in the early secretory pathway of yeast. Using transient expression we find that overexpression of rat liver Sly1 (rSly1) can neutralize the dominant negative effects of excess syntaxin 5 on endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport. These results suggest that rSly1 functions to positively regulate syntaxin 5 function. Members of the syntaxin gene family are components of protein complexes which regulate vesicle docking and/or fusion during transport of cargo through the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. We have previously demonstrated that syntaxin 5 is specifically required for endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport (Dascher, C., Matteson, J., and Balch, W. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29363-29366). To extend these observations we have now cloned a protein from rat liver membranes which forms a native complex with syntaxin 5. We demonstrate that this protein is the mammalian homologue to yeast Sly1p, previously identified as a protein which genetically and biochemically interacts with the small GTPase Ypt1p and Sed5p, proteins involved in docking/fusion in the early secretory pathway of yeast. Using transient expression we find that overexpression of rat liver Sly1 (rSly1) can neutralize the dominant negative effects of excess syntaxin 5 on endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport. These results suggest that rSly1 functions to positively regulate syntaxin 5 function."
https://openalex.org/W1981252506,"We recently reported the discovery of a 17-kDa Plasmodium yoelii protein expressed in infected hepatocytes and erythrocytes, P. yoelii hepatocyte erythrocyte protein 17 (PyHEP17), and have demonstrated that this protein is a target of protective antibodies and T cells. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the gene encoding this protein and reveal that it is composed of two exons. Immunization of mice with PyHEP17 plasmid DNA induces antibodies, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and protective immunity directed against the infected hepatocyte. Based on extensive sequence homology, expression pattern, and antigenic cross-reactivity, the Plasmodium falciparum homolog of PyHEP17 is identified as the protein known as exported protein-1 (PfExp-1), also called antigen 5.1, circumsporozoite related antigen, or QF116. Identity between PyHEP17 and PfExp-1 is 37% at the amino acid level (60/161 residues), mapping primarily to two regions within the second exon of 73% (16/22 residues) and 71% (25/35 residues) identity. On this basis, PfExp-1 is proposed as an important component of pre-erythrocytic human malaria vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2004276861,"Previous studies have suggested that the enzyme microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) is able to mediate sodium-dependent transport of bile acids such as taurocholate into hepatocytes (von Dippe, P., Amoui, M., Alves, C., and Levy, D. (1993) Am. J. Physiol. 264, G528-G534). In order to characterize directly the putative transport properties of the enzyme, a pCB6 vector containing the cDNA for this protein (pCB6-mEH) was transfected into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and stable transformants were isolated that could express mEH at levels comparable with the levels expressed in hepatocytes. Sodium-dependent transport of taurocholate was shown to be dependent on the expression of mEH and to be inhibited by the bile acid transport inhibitor 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′disulfonic acid (DIDS), as well as by other bile acids. Kinetic analysis of this system indicated a Km of 26.3 µM and a Vmax of 117 pmol/mg protein/min. The Km value is essentially the same as that observed in intact hepatocytes. The transfected MDCK cells also exhibited sodium-dependent transport of cholate at levels 150% of taurocholate in contrast to hepatocytes where cholate transport is only 30% of taurocholate levels, suggesting that total hepatocyte bile acid transport is a function of multiple transport systems with different substrate specificities, where mEH preferentially transports cholate. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that a monoclonal antibody that partially protects (26%) taurocholate transport from inhibition by DIDS in hepatocytes provides almost complete protection (88%) from DIDS inhibition of hepatocyte cholate transport, suggesting that taurocholate is also taken up by an alternative system not recognized by this antibody. Additional support for this concept is provided by the observation that the taurocholate transport system is almost completely protected (92%) from DIDS inhibition by this antibody in MDCK cells that express mEH as the only bile acid transporter. These results demonstrate that mEH is expressed on the surface of hepatocytes as well as on transfected MDCK cells and is able to mediate sodium-dependent transport of taurocholate and cholate. Previous studies have suggested that the enzyme microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) is able to mediate sodium-dependent transport of bile acids such as taurocholate into hepatocytes (von Dippe, P., Amoui, M., Alves, C., and Levy, D.

These results demonstrate that mEH is expressed on the surface of hepatocytes as well as on transfected MDCK cells and is able to mediate sodium-dependent transport of taurocholate and cholate. Numerous studies have been concerned with characterizing the hepatocyte membrane transport systems that mediate the sodium-dependent uptake of organic anions such as bile acids. These compounds play a critical role in numerous physiological processes such as digestion, biliary excretion of cholesterol and metabolites of exogenous species such as carcinogens, and regulation of cholesterol metabolism (1Petzinger E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 123: 47-211Google Scholar, 2Tavoloni N. Berk P.D. Hepatic Transport and Bile Secretion. Raven Press Ltd., New York1993Google Scholar). These systems have been studied in perfused liver, intact hepatocytes, and sinusoidal plasma membrane vesicles. Kinetic studies have suggested the parallel functioning of several distinct sodium-dependent organic anion transporters with different substrate specificity profiles (3Yamazaki M. Suzuki H. Hanano M. Sugiyama Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G693-G701Google Scholar, 4Honscha W. Schulz K. Muller D. Petzinger E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 246: 227-232Google Scholar, 5Anwer M.S. Hegner D.

Two unrelated proteins with similar apparent molecular masses (∼50 kDa) have been proposed as putative sodium-dependent bile acid transporters. One of these proteins (Ntcp) was identified using expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes and was shown to mediate sodium-dependent taurocholate transport in oocytes as well as in transfected COS-7 cells with kinetic properties consistent with those observed in hepatocytes (6Boyer J.L. Ng O.-C. Ananthanarayanan M. Hofmann A.F. Schteingart C.D. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G382-G387Google Scholar, 7Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foruet M. Lubbert H.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5942-5945Google Scholar) indicated the involvement of an additional protein in the transport process. This protein was isolated and subsequently shown to be indistinguishable from the enzyme microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) (EC) (13von Dippe P. Amoui M. Alves C. Levy D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G528-G534Google Scholar), which also plays a central role in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogens (14Thomas H. Timms C.W. Oesch F. Ruckpaul K. Rein H. Principles, Mechanisms and Biological Consequences of Induction. Taylor and Francis Ltd., London1990: 278Google Scholar). It is pertinent to note that several other proteins such as dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (15Stolz A. Takikawa H. Ookhtens M. Kaplowitz N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 161-176Google Scholar), glutathione S-transferase (15Stolz A. Takikawa H. Ookhtens M. Kaplowitz N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 161-176Google Scholar, 16Coles B. Ketterer B. Crit.

The expression of mEH on the hepatocyte sinusoidal surface in addition to its well documented location in the endoplasmic reticulum raises a number of provocative questions concerning the mechanism of membrane protein targeting. Evidence to support the surface location of this protein was first suggested by studies using a variety of enzymatic markers (19Stasiecki P. Oesch F. Bruder G. Jarasch E.-D. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 21: 79-92Google Scholar) and subsequently confirmed by the demonstration that a mAb reacting with mEH could block labeling of sinusoidal plasma membranes in intact hepatocyte as well as partially protect hepatocytes from inhibition of taurocholate transport by the anion transport inhibitor, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′ disulfonic acid (DIDS) (10Ananthanarayanan M. von Dippe P. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8338-8343Google Scholar). Confocal immunofluorescence analysis of intact hepatocytes using a mAb against mEH also demonstrated the expression of this protein on the hepatocyte surface. 2P. von Dippe, R. H. Stellwagen, and D. Levy, manuscript in preparation. In addition to mEH, several cytochrome P-450 enzymes have been shown to be expressed on the surface of hepatocytes as well as the endoplasmic reticulum (20Robin M.-A.

Hepatology. 1990; 11: 850-858Google Scholar) with an orientation based on epitope mapping that would suggest the existence of two alternate topologies in the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent studies have demonstrated directly or indirectly that several proteins such as mEH (23Alves C. von Dippe P. Amoui M. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20148-20155Google Scholar), P-glycoprotein (24Khang J.-T. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18224-18232Google Scholar, 25Skach W.R. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6903-6908Google Scholar), several cytochrome P-450 enzymes (20Robin M.-A. Maratrat M. Loeper J. Durand-Schneider A.-M. Tinel M. Baller F. Beaune P. Feldmann G. Pessayre D. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 1110-1123Google Scholar), and ductin (26Dunlop J. Jones P.C. Finbow M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3609-3616Google Scholar) can exhibit two or more distinct topological orientations generated from a single population of nascent chains. Alternate protein topologies may thus result in differential targeting of these alternate forms, resulting in the expression of some proteins at multiple cell sites. In order to demonstrate directly the transport properties of mEH, which were suggested by previous studies on hepatocytes, and to assess its function in the absence of Ntcp, we have employed cDNA transfection procedures, which have established that this bifunctional protein, when expressed on the plasma membrane, is able to mediate the sodium-dependent uptake of taurocholate and cholate into transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The cDNA for mEH was prepared from rat liver poly(A)+ mRNA using reverse transcriptase and the polymerase chain reaction amplification procedure (27Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 21Google Scholar) and subsequently ligated into the BglII/KpnI sites of the pCB6 vector under the control of the butyrate-inducible cytomegalovirus promoter for expression in MDCK cells. Synthetic oligonucleotide primers for the polymerase chain reaction were targeted toward sequences in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of mEH beginning at position 85 and ending at position 1582 in the published cDNA sequence (28Porter T.D. Beck T.W. Kasper C.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 121-129Google Scholar). The primers were also designed to introduce new restriction sites for subsequent use in the construction of expression vector pCB6-mEH by standard techniques (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The fidelity of vector constructs was verified by restriction mapping and by DNA sequencing of the cDNA insert using the dideoxy procedure (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). MDCK (NLB-2) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MDCK cells were transfected with pCB6-mEH using calcium phosphate precipitation procedures (30Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Stable transformants were obtained by selecting in the presence of G-418 (500 µg/ml). After 3 weeks numerous resistant clones were obtained that expressed mEH. The transfected cells were subsequently treated with sodium butyrate (10 mM) for 20 h as described previously (31Weisz O.A. Machamer C.E. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22282-22288Google Scholar) to increase the expression of mEH. Transfected MDCK cells expressing tyrosine aminotransferase (32Kohli K.K. Stellwagen R.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 194-200Google Scholar) instead of mEH as well as untransfected cells were used as controls. MDCK cells or hepatocytes were solubilized, quantitatively immunoprecipitated with mAb 25D-1 (10Ananthanarayanan M. von Dippe P. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8338-8343Google Scholar), and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity of mEH was measured using [3H]cis-stilbene oxide as described (34Wixtrom R.N. Hammock B.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 1: 1-93Google Scholar). MDCK cells were removed from tissue culture dishes (100 mm) by initial treatment with 4.5 ml of a 0.002% trypsin solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 5 min at 37°C, followed by washing with 2 ml of medium/fetal bovine serum followed by 10 ml of PBS. The cells were then treated with 4.5 ml of EDTA (0.07-0.15 mM) in PBS for 5 min at 37°C so that the cells could be detached by moderate pipetting of this solution on the surface of the monolayer. The amount of EDTA used was dependent on the particular clone and on the time under culture conditions. Detached cells were washed in PBS, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2 by centrifugation for 2 min at 1000 × g, and the resultant pellets were suspended in either 140 mM NaCl or 140 mM choline chloride in 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4. The combined pellets derived from five plates were suspended in 800 µl of either of these buffers. Uptake was measured by adding 125 µl of buffer containing sodium or choline chloride with various amounts of [3H]taurocholate or [3H]cholate as well as unlabeled bile acid to 125 µl of buffer containing approximately 2 × 106 MDCK cells. Transport was measured at 37°C for the indicated time periods at various concentrations. Uptake was terminated by the rapid addition of 1 ml of buffer at 4°C, and the cell suspension was isolated by rapid centrifugation through light mineral oil and dibutyl phthalate (1:4). The surface of the pellet was washed with 0.4 ml of buffer followed by suspension of the pellet in 0.3 ml of 0.1 N NaOH, and the associated radioactivity was evaluated. These values were corrected for radioactivity associated with the cell pellet when cells in 1 ml of buffer at 4°C were added to the labeled substrate and immediately centrifuged. Inhibition studies using bile acids were affected by the simultaneous addition of these compounds with the particular substrate. DIDS inhibition was evaluated by preincubating the cells with this reagent (100 µM) for 20 min at 37°C prior to uptake measurements. The effect of mAb 25A-3 (1 mg/ml) on DIDS inhibition of bile acid transport was evaluated by preincubating the cells with the antibody for 30 min at 37°C prior to the addition of DIDS. Hepatocytes were obtained from the livers of Sprague-Dawley rats using a collagenase perfusion technique (35Zahlten R.N. Stratman F.W. Lardy H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3213-3218Google Scholar). Cell viability throughout the course of the experiments was estimated by trypan blue exclusion. All studies were carried out on hepatocyte suspensions with an 85-93% viability. The effects of DIDS and mAb 25A-3 on the transport of taurocholate and cholate were determined as described previously (10Ananthanarayanan M. von Dippe P. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8338-8343Google Scholar). All experiments (n = 3-20) were carried out with quadruplicate determinations. The data represent the means ± S.E. [3H-G]Taurocholic acid (3.47 Ci/mmol) and [2,4-3H(N)] cholic acid (27.5 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies Inc. The pCB6 vector was from James E. Casanova (Harvard Medical School). 3H-Labeled cis-stilbene oxide was from Dr. Bruce D. Hammock (University of California, Davis). The expression vector pCB6-mEH was transfected into MDCK cells, and stable transformants were selected based on G-418 resistance. Clones were tested for the expression of mEH by immunoprecipitation with mAb 25D-1 as shown in Fig. 1. Cells transfected with pCB6 lacking the mEH insert (Fig. 1, lane c) or untransfected cells (data not shown) did not express mEH. Transfection with PCB6-mEH followed by induction with butyrate gave the correct immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1, lane b). Butyrate treatment resulted in an approximately 10-fold increase in mEH expression to levels comparable with those found in hepatocytes (Fig. 1, lane a). In addition to the close correspondence of mEH levels and molecular weight in MDCK cells compared with hepatocytes, the specific enzymatic activity of mEH was also shown to be 85% of that observed in hepatocytes. Several of these clones were then tested for sodium-dependent bile acid transport capacity. The functional integrity of the transfected cells was shown to be extremely sensitive to the amounts of EDTA and trypsin used to remove the cells from the plate prior to transport measurements. Cells transfected with pCB6 without the mEH insert as described above resulted in negligible sodium-dependent transport as shown in Fig. 2 (lane 1). Similar results were obtained with pCB6-mEH transfected cells at 4°C or at 37°C without butyrate induction and when using untransfected MDCK cells (data not shown). Untransfected cells did exhibit an undefined bile acid association that was identical in the presence and the absence of Na+ (20 and 4 pmol/mg/min for 5 and 1 µM taurocholate and 8 pmol/mg/min for 1 µM cholate) and was also insensitive to DIDS or bile acid derivatives. Transfected MDCK cells, in the absence of Na+, also exhibited this background, which was unaffected by DIDS, bile acid derivatives, and serum albumin. The functional expression of sodium-dependent transport of taurocholate by MDCK cells was dependent on the expression of mEH (Fig. 2, lane 2). Treatment of these cells with 0.2% trypsin for 10 min at 37°C resulted in a 90% loss of transport capacity (data not shown). Sodium-dependent taurocholate transport was also significantly inhibited by the bile acid transport inhibitor DIDS (Fig. 2, lane 4) and by other bile acids where cholate was a considerably more effective inhibitor than taurochenodeoxycholate (Fig. 3). The inhibitory efficiency of these bile acids on taurocholate transport is reversed from that observed in isolated hepatocytes (5Anwer M.S. Hegner D. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1978; 359: 181-192Google Scholar) or COS-7 cells transfected with Ntcp (6Boyer J.L. Ng O.-C. Ananthanarayanan M. Hofmann A.F. Schteingart C.D. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G382-G387Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of a different substrate profile for Ntcp and mEH. Taurocholate uptake was also significantly inhibited by bovine serum albumin (75%) (Fig. 2, lane 5) in contrast to the stimulatory effect of this protein on taurocholate uptake mediated by Ntcp (4Honscha W. Schulz K. Muller D. Petzinger E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 246: 227-232Google Scholar). A similar inhibitory effect by bovine serum albumin has, however, been observed for bumetanide uptake in oocytes, mediated by a protein that also transports taurocholate but is different from Ntcp (4Honscha W. Schulz K. Muller D. Petzinger E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 246: 227-232Google Scholar). The relationship of the bumetanide transport protein and mEH remains to be elucidated. The time course for sodium-dependent uptake of taurocholate by the transfected MDCK cells, shown in Fig. 4 is linear for at least 30 s. The initial transport rates (15 s) as a function of substrate concentration (1-50 µM) are shown in Fig. 5. Analysis of these results on an Eadie-Scatchard plot indicated a Km of 26.3 µM and a Vmax of 117 pmol/mg protein/min. This Km value is essentially the same as that observed for taurocholate uptake in hepatocytes (1Petzinger E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 123: 47-211Google Scholar) as well as in oocytes and COS-7 cells expressing Ntcp (6Boyer J.L. Ng O.-C. Ananthanarayanan M. Hofmann A.F. Schteingart C.D. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B.

In contrast to hepatocytes, where sodium-dependent cholate uptake is approximately 30% of taurocholate uptake (3Yamazaki M. Suzuki H. Hanano M. Sugiyama Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G693-G701Google Scholar, 5Anwer M.S. Hegner D. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1978; 359: 181-192Google Scholar), cholate transport in the MDCK cell system (Fig. 6, lane 2) was 50% higher than taurocholate transport as shown in Fig. 3 (lane 1). Estimates from available data in the literature suggest that Ntcp expressed in oocytes primarily transports taurocholate (36Hagenbuch B. Jacquemin E. Meier P.J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 4: 198-205Google Scholar). These observations would indicate that the bile acid transport characteristics observed in hepatocytes may thus be comprised of contributions from Ntcp as well as mEH and possibly other as yet to be defined transport systems. Previous studies have demonstrated that mAb 25A-3, although incapable of directly inhibiting taurocholate transport, was able to protect hepatocytes from DIDS inhibition of taurocholate uptake by 26% (10Ananthanarayanan M. von Dippe P. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8338-8343Google Scholar). This low protection value suggests that there may be other transporters, such as Ntcp, that mediate taurocholate transport but that are not recognized by this antibody. To further probe this possibility, the MDCK cells transfected with pCB6-mEH and exhibiting sodium-dependent taurocholate transport capacity were also pretreated with mAb 25A-3. As shown in Table I, the observed DIDS inhibition (also shown in Fig. 2, lane 4) was now decreased by 92%, demonstrating that the antibody was effective in protecting the cell in question from DIDS inhibition, and in the case where mEH is the only functioning transporter, protection is essentially complete. In hepatocytes, where multiple transporters exist, protection is less pronounced (Table I). The above results suggest that the mEH system may be the primary system for sodium-dependent cholate transport in hepatocytes. In this regard, the ability of mAb 25A-3 to block DIDS inhibition of hepatocyte cholate transport was also investigated. As shown in Table I, this antibody was able to protect cholate transport by 88% as compared with 26% for taurocholate, further supporting the concept that sodium-dependent cholate transport is mediated primarily by mEH.Table ImAb (25A-3) protection of DIDS inhibition of taurocholate and cholate transport in hepatocytes and in transfected MDCK cells expressing mEHCellSubstrateInhibitionmAb protection of DIDS inhibitionDIDS25A-3/DIDS%HepatocyteTC58.943.626.0HepatocyteC85.410.188.2MDCKmEHTC57.14.592.1 Open table in a new tab Previous studies have suggested that mEH is able to mediate sodium-dependent bile acid transport into hepatocytes (10Ananthanarayanan M. von Dippe P. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8338-8343Google Scholar, 11von Dippe P. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14812-14816Google Scholar, 12von Dippe P. Levy D. J. Biol.

In order to further establish this functional role, MDCK cells were transfected with pCB6-mEH, which resulted in permanent transformants that expressed mEH (Fig. 1), as well as sodium-dependent bile acid transport (Fig. 2). These properties are not found in untransfected MDCK cells or in cells transfected without the mEH insert and are greatly reduced in cells expressing low levels of mEH prior to butyrate induction. Transport was shown to be stimulated by Na+ and significantly inhibited by the bile acid transport inhibitor DIDS as well as other bile acids (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The physiological significance of this transporter is supported by the Eadie-Scatchard analysis of the substrate concentration curve (Fig. 5), which indicated a Km value of 26.3 µM, which is similar to those values previously reported for hepatocytes (1Petzinger E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 123: 47-211Google Scholar) as well as for COS-7 cells transfected with Ntcp (6Boyer J.L. Ng O.-C. Ananthanarayanan M. Hofmann A.F. Schteingart C.D. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G382-G387Google Scholar). In contrast, the substrate specificities of these two systems are different, because mEH preferentially transports cholate (Fig. 6), whereas Ntcp transports primarily taurocholate (36Hagenbuch B. Jacquemin E. Meier P.J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 4: 198-205Google Scholar). The possibility of more than one sodium-dependent transport system has also been supported by kinetic studies, suggesting the functional contribution of two sodium-dependent taurocholate transport systems, one of which also transports cholate (3Yamazaki M. Suzuki H. Hanano M. Sugiyama Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G693-G701Google Scholar, 5Anwer M.S. Hegner D. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1978; 359: 181-192Google Scholar). Studies utilizing X. laevis oocytes have also suggested the existence of a mRNA fraction that upon oocyte injection results in the expression of a protein that mediates the sodium-dependent uptake of cholate and bumetanide as well as taurocholate. Oocytes expressing Ntcp, in contrast, preferentially transport taurocholate, have a reduced transport capacity for cholate and a negligible uptake of bumetanide, clearly establishing the existence of two distinct transporters (4Honscha W. Schulz K. Muller D. Petzinger E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 246: 227-232Google Scholar). Further evidence that the observed sodium-dependent uptake of bile acids is a result of the contribution from more than one transport system is derived from the antibody protection experiments described in Table I. The partial protective effect (26%) of mAb 25A-3 on the DIDS inhibition of taurocholate transport in hepatocytes suggests the parallel functioning of another transport system that is not affected by this antibody. In contrast, mAb 25A-3 afforded at least 92% protection from DIDS inhibition of taurocholate transport in the MDCK cells, which establishes that mEH is expressed on the surface of MDCK cells following transfection, with a topology in this system that is the same as in hepatocytes as adjudged by the recognition of the 25A-3 epitope on the cell surface. In addition, the high level of effectiveness of this antibody in protecting taurocholate transport from DIDS inhibition when mEH is the only functional bile acid carrier, suggests that the 26% protection observed in hepatocytes may in fact roughly approximate the contribution of mEH to the total uptake of taurocholate. The large protective effect of this antibody (88%) on hepatocyte cholate transport is also in agreement with the observed preferential uptake of this bile acid by mEH and suggests that this system appears to be the primary physiological transporter for cholate and possibly other, as yet to be defined, substrates, complementing the physiological role of Ntcp as the primary transporter of taurocholate. During development, mEH is expressed at 10% of adult levels at day 19 of gestation as assessed by immunoprecipitation procedures with mAb 25D-1 and is shown to reach adult levels approximately 50-60 days after birth (12von Dippe P. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5942-5945Google Scholar). This time course is also closely paralleled by the expression of mEH enzymatic activity and the increase in taurocholate transport capacity (37Stoming T.J. Bresnick E. Cancer Res. 1974; 34: 2810-2813Google Scholar, 38Suchy F.J. Balistreri W.F. Pediatr. Res. 1982; 16: 282-285Google Scholar, 39Horsfield B.P. Reidy G.F. Murray M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 815-818Google Scholar). A complementary study (40Ananthanarayanan M. Bucuvalas J.C. Shneider B.L. Sipple C.J. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G810-G817Google Scholar) exploring the identity of the sodium-dependent bile acid transporter was performed based on the observed ontogenic expression of a protein whose apparent molecular mass (48 kDa) and isoelectric point (approximately 9) were very close, if not indistinguishable from mEH (apparent molecular mass, 49 kDa; pI, 8.2). This protein was first detected at day 20 of gestation, and its intensity increased during post natal development at a rate corresponding to the ontogenic expression of sodium-dependent taurocholate transport activity. Monospecific, polyclonal antibodies raised against this protein directly inhibited transport by 50%, whereas proteoliposome reconstitution also implicated this protein in the transport process. Additional independent evidence demonstrates that the photoaffinity labeling of a 50-kDa protein utilizing a photoreactive analog of taurocholate was significantly reduced from the levels observed in adult hepatocytes when using hepatocyte plasma membranes from 9-day-old rats (41Ziegler K. Frimmer M. Mullner S. Fasold H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 980: 161-168Google Scholar). Taken together, our studies as well as those of Suchy and co-workers and Ziegler et al. (40Ananthanarayanan M. Bucuvalas J.C. Shneider B.L. Sipple C.J. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G810-G817Google Scholar, 41Ziegler K. Frimmer M. Mullner S. Fasold H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 980: 161-168Google Scholar) strongly implicate a 48-50-kDa protein whose level of expression increases over a period of approximately 50-60 days without a change in its molecular mass. The identity of the 48-kDa protein reported by Suchy has, however, not been published. This same group has reported an additional study (42Hardikar W. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20841-20846Google Scholar) on the ontogenic expression of a sodium-dependent bile acid transporter represented by Ntcp as elucidated by Meier and co-workers (7Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foruet M. Lubbert H. Meier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10629-10633Google Scholar), which is clearly not related to mEH or to the 48-kDa protein originally reported by Suchy and co-workers (40Ananthanarayanan M. Bucuvalas J.C. Shneider B.L. Sipple C.J. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G810-G817Google Scholar). Of particular note in this report is the fact that during development, Ntcp is expressed with a molecular mass of 39 kDa and is only converted to the adult form (50 kDa) by further glycosylation at some time after 4 weeks, clearly differentiating this processing from that observed for mEH. Surprisingly, the level of expression of Ntcp is 82% of adult levels on postnatal day 1 and reaches adult levels within the first week when the level of sodium-dependent taurocholate transport is only 25% of adult levels. Because there is no apparent change in the molecular weight or level of expression of Ntcp during the first 4 weeks, whereas transport capacity (Vmax) increases dramatically during this time period (38Suchy F.J. Balistreri W.F. Pediatr. Res. 1982; 16: 282-285Google Scholar), it appears that there is a significant discordance between the expression of Ntcp and sodium-dependent taurocholate transport during the first month of postnatal development. In contrast, the functional expression of sodium-dependent bile acid transport on the apical surface of the rat ileum during postnatal development (1-6 weeks) closely parallels the expression of the recently cloned ileum transporter for these substrates (43Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.-M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Google Scholar). A similar relationship is also observed for a hepatic sinusoidal sodium-independent organic anion transporter. 3A. W. Wolkoff, personal communication. The relative contributions of mEH and Ntcp in mediating the uptake of taurocholate as well as other bile acids and nonbile acid substrates in different physiological states remains to be established. An antibody against Ntcp that could directly demonstrate the functional role of Ntcp in hepatocytes, as we have reported in this and other studies for mEH, would be useful in establishing their respective physiological roles. Recently a study has been published that suggests an inability to correlate the expression of mEH in transfected BHK cells with the appearance of mediated transport for taurocholate, cholate, or bumetanide (44Honscha W. Platte H.-D. Oesch F. Friedberg T. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 975-979Google Scholar). Obtaining negative results in a particular heterologous expression system does not necessarily disprove a thesis. In the case of MDCK transfectants, numerous technical details needed to be established before a functional system was obtained. In this regard, we have demonstrated the sensitivity of transfected MDCK cells to trypsin treatment. Because Honscha et al. (44Honscha W. Platte H.-D. Oesch F. Friedberg T. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 975-979Google Scholar) have used this enzyme, albeit at an unstated concentration and time period, to remove the BHK cells from the plate prior to measuring transport, their procedures may have led to the inactivation of this transport system. Furthermore they have (a) failed to establish whether mEH was expressed on the surface of the transfected BHK cells; (b) reported that the enzymatic activity of mEH expressed in BHK cells was only 12% of the activity observed in hepatocytes; and (c) contradicted previous reports of one of the authors concerning the surface localization of mEH in hepatocytes (19Stasiecki P. Oesch F. Bruder G. Jarasch E.-D. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 21: 79-92Google Scholar). Their conclusions must therefore be questioned. In conclusion, the results presented in this paper strongly support our previous studies and directly demonstrate the ability of mEH to mediate the sodium-dependent transport of taurocholate and cholate into MDCK cells and to participate with Ntcp in the net uptake of these substrates in hepatocytes. The membrane topology and cell targeting of this protein as well as its interaction with nonbile acid substrates such as steroids and carcinogens is under investigation. Hepatocytes were obtained from the Cell Culture Facility of the U. S. C. Liver Disease Research Center.

The subcellular location of the receptor was visualized by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and quantified with the use of binding studies. The receptor redistributed into intracellular compartments following agonist treatment. This process was reversible upon removal of agonist and inhibited by antagonist. Acid treatment of the cells, which disrupts internalization via clathrin-coated vesicles, inhibited carbachol-stimulated internalization.

An increased expression of IGF-II was observed when these cells were treated with the DNA demethylating agents, 5-azacytidine or 2-deoxy-5-azacytidine. Allelic analysis indicated that, following DNA demethylation, the increment in IGF-II mRNA was primarily derived from the normally suppressed maternal allele. Examination of promoter usage revealed that only the most proximal promoter (mP3 in mouse and hP4 in human) responded to DNA demethylating agents, whereas the expression of IGF-II from the other promoters remained unchanged.

This is interesting in view of observations regarding the regulation of hexokinases in various physiologic circumstances. For example, skeletal muscle glucose utilization is increased by exercise (9Devlin J.T. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), an effect that can be explained in part by the observation that a single bout of acute exercise increases HKII gene transcription, mRNA, and protein in rat skeletal muscle (10O'Doherty R.M.

Other physiologic stimuli, such as cold stress, swimming, or the administration of β-adrenergic agonists, increase total hexokinase activity in rat and mouse brown adipose tissue and muscle (11Cooney G.J.

The mechanism of these effects is unknown but could involve cAMP.The regulation of gene transcription by cAMP has been analyzed quite extensively (15Lee K.A.W. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar, 17Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M.

Science. 1988; 242: 1430-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Hormones such as β-adrenergic agonists that couple cell surface receptors to adenylate cyclase result in increased intracellular levels of cAMP. Cyclic AMP, in turn, activates protein kinase A, which enters the nucleus and phosphorylates cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) on Ser133 (19Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7623-7630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated CREB, bound to the cyclic AMP response element (CRE), enhances transcription through linked promoters (21Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III, W.

Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1), a protein closely related to CREB, also binds CREs and mediates cAMP responsiveness in certain genes (23Rehfuss R.P. Walton K.M. Loriaux M.M. Goodman R.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6714-6720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A CCAAT box and an inverted CCAAT box mediate cAMP responsiveness in several promoters that lack typical CREs, but the factors that bind to these elements were not identified (25Boularand S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2307-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).We initiated an analysis of the HKII promoter in L6 cells, a cell line representative of rat skeletal muscle, to further understand how hormones influence HKII gene expression. The basal promoter consists of about 160 bp of 5′-flanking sequence that includes an inverted CCAAT box (henceforth referred to as the Y box), a CCAAT box, and the CRE. The CCAAT box and the CRE are both involved in cAMP responsiveness and are functionally redundant in this regard. The Y box does not play a role in cAMP responsiveness but does contribute to basal promoter activity. Several known transcription factors bind to these sequences, notably CREB and ATF-1 to the CRE and NF-Y to both the Y and the CCAAT boxes.DISCUSSIONThe promoter for the rat HKII gene was isolated and used to construct HKII-CAT fusion genes as a means of identifying cis-acting DNA elements important for HKII gene expression. The HKII-CAT fusion gene constructs were transiently expressed following transfection into differentiated L6 cells. Ichihara et al. (52Ichihara J. Shinohara Y. Kogure K. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) used a reporter gene similar to the 4A construct employed in this paper to direct the expression of a CAT fusion gene in the SR-3Y1-2 transformed fibroblast cell line. Mathupala et al. (53Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) recently reported that approximately 4.3 kb of the rat HKII promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene directed basal expression in AS-30D hepatoma cells and in cultured hepatocytes. The basal promoter activity directed by this construct was comparable in magnitude in both cell types; however, glucose, insulin, or glucagon increased fusion gene expression only in the hepatoma cells (53Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).We chose to study HKII gene expression in L6 cells, a cell line representative of skeletal muscle, which is a primary site of expression of the gene (4Katzen H.M. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5Grossbard L. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3546-3560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously used these cells to study the regulation of HKII gene transcription by insulin and cAMP (6Printz R.L. Koch S. Potter L.R. O'Doherty R.M. Tiesinga J.J. Moritz S. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5209-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Osawa H. Printz R.L. Whitesell R.R. Granner D.K. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1426-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and now extend these earlier studies by identifying three cis-acting DNA elements in the HKII promoter, a Y box, a CCAAT box and a CRE, that are required for basal gene expression. Two of these elements, the CCAAT box and CRE, are required for the induction of the gene by cAMP and have redundant, nonadditive roles in mediating this response.The Y box element, originally defined as an inverted CCAAT motif (CTGYY) in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes, plays an important role in tissue-specific gene expression (for review, see 47Benoist C. Mathis D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 681-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar and 48Glimcher L.H. Kara C.J. Annu. Rev.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6249-6253Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 54Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), stimulates gene transcription when bound to the Y box (55Framson P. Bornstein P. J. Biol.

Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). NF-Y is highly conserved among species and is composed of several subunits, referred to as NF-YA (CBF-B), NF-YB (CBF-A), and CBF-C; all these subunits bind to DNA as a complex (51Hooft van Huijsduijnen R.

Although the MHC class II genes are expressed in a cell-specific pattern, NF-Y is ubiquitously expressed (51Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 61Hooft van Huijsduijnen R.A.M. Bollekens J. Dorn A. Benoist C. Mathis D.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The present study shows that NF-Y binds two highly homologous sequences, the Y box and the CCAAT box, in the rat HKII promoter. Specific mutations in either the Y box or the CCAAT box that reduce binding of NF-Y have corresponding effects on the transcriptional activity of reporter genes that contain these elements.The HKII CRE binds both CREB and ATF-1, factors known to affect basal and cAMP responses in a variety of genes (23Rehfuss R.P. Walton K.M. Loriaux M.M. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18431-18434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liu F. Thompson M.A. Wagner S. Greenberg M.E. Green M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6714-6720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations of the HKII gene CRE that result in reduced binding of CREB and ATF-1 also result in decreased basal activity of the promoter. These mutations, however, had no effect on the cAMP response. Cyclic AMP induction is only lost when both the HKII CCAAT box and the CRE are mutated. Since mutations that affect only the CCAAT box have no effect on the cAMP response, the HKII CCAAT box-NF-Y complex and the CRE-CREB/ATF-1 complex have a redundant role in the cAMP response. To our knowledge, NF-Y has not been associated with cAMP responsiveness; nor has it been directly implicated as a regulator of genes involved in glucose metabolism. In this regard, it should be noted that an inverted CCAAT box mediates cAMP responsiveness of the human tryptophan hydroxylase gene and fatty acid synthase gene through an interaction with an unknown nuclear factor (25Boularand S. Darmon M.C. Ravassard P. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3757-3764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Rangan V.S. Oskouian B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2307-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, a CCAAT box mediates the cAMP response of the G-protein αi2 subunit gene, which lacks a typical CRE (26Kinane T.B. Shang C. Finder J.D. Ercolani L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24669-24676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see if NF-Y is involved in these effects.The apparent role of NF-Y in the cAMP response of the HKII gene was not expected. CREB and ATF-1 bind constitutively to CREs and support basal transcription. The phosphorylation of these proteins by PKA results in an enhanced rate of gene transcription (15Lee K.A.W. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liu F. Thompson M.A. Wagner S. Greenberg M.E. Green M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6714-6720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 69Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). PKA-mediated phosphorylation of NF-Y has not been reported, but the protein does contain several consensus phosphorylation sites (data not shown). Phosphorylation could increase the affinity of binding of NF-Y to the HKII CCAAT box, which has a lower binding affinity for the protein than does the consensus Y box. Alternatively, phosphorylation could enhance the transactivation potential of constitutively bound NF-Y, as happens with CREB.The orientation of the CCAAT box relative to the CRE did not alter the PKA response, but the introduction of a half turn in the DNA helix between the CCAAT box and the CRE reduces the PKA induction, and insertion of a full turn maintains the response. This suggests that a specific helical orientation of the binding factors NF-Y and CREB/ATF-1 is critical for the PKA response in the rat HKII gene. A similar stereospecific alignment of the Y box and X box is required for MHC class II DRA promoter function (70Vilen B.J. Cogswell J.P. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).As summarized in Fig. 8, NF-Y bound to the CCAAT box and CREB/ATF-1 bound to the CRE play important roles in both basal and cAMP-induced expression of the rat HKII gene. A third element important for basal HKII gene transcription, the Y box, also binds NF-Y. Finally, a typical TATA box is located near the transcription initiation site. It is not clear which of the combinations of CREB and ATF-1 are involved in the basal and cAMP-mediated responses through the CRE. It is also not clear how NF-Y is involved in these responses. Further experiments should help clarify these points.

Hormones such as β-adrenergic agonists that couple cell surface receptors to adenylate cyclase result in increased intracellular levels of cAMP. Cyclic AMP, in turn, activates protein kinase A, which enters the nucleus and phosphorylates cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) on Ser133 (19Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

The basal promoter consists of about 160 bp of 5′-flanking sequence that includes an inverted CCAAT box (henceforth referred to as the Y box), a CCAAT box, and the CRE. The CCAAT box and the CRE are both involved in cAMP responsiveness and are functionally redundant in this regard. The Y box does not play a role in cAMP responsiveness but does contribute to basal promoter activity. Several known transcription factors bind to these sequences, notably CREB and ATF-1 to the CRE and NF-Y to both the Y and the CCAAT boxes."

The affinity of binding was up to 20-fold lower using membranes preincubated with mitotic cytosol. In contrast, binding was not affected by mitotic pretreatment of p115. The reduction in p115 binding was mediated by phosphorylation, could be induced by a cyclin-dependent kinase, and was fully reversible. A shift of p115 from membranes to cytosol was also found after fractionating mitotic cells. The functional significance of the decreased binding was addressed by in vitro mitotic incubations which disassemble Golgi cisternae, predominantly producing transport vesicles. The addition of excess p115 decreased loss of membrane from cisternae, indicating that p115's action is limiting while transport vesicles accumulate. The cessation of intra-Golgi traffic in mitosis has been hypothesized to result from an inhibition of membrane fusion while budding of transport vesicles continues. This process also contributes to mitotic Golgi disassembly. Our results imply that there is a mitotic modification to Golgi membranes leading to a reduction in the affinity of the p115 receptor.

In this system, vesicle generation is temperature- and ATP-dependent and requires a supply of cytosolic proteins, including an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor distinct from NSF. Cytosolic proteins obtained from yeast were as effective as mammalian cytosolic proteins in supporting vesicle formation and had the same requirements. The vesicles produced (50-80 nm in diameter) are depleted of the trans Golgi marker sialyltransferase, contain the viral glycoprotein molecules with their cytoplasmic tails exposed, and do not show an easily recognizable protein coat. Vesicle generation was inhibited by brefeldin A, which indicates that it requires the activation of an Arf-like GTP-binding protein that promotes assembly of a vesicle coat. Vesicles formed in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate retained a nonclathrin protein coat resembling that of COP-coated vesicles, and sedimented more rapidly in a sucrose gradient than the uncoated ones generated in its absence.

https://openalex.org/W1966204112,"Heparin suppresses mitogenic responses in renal mesangial cells, and when quiescent mesangial cells are stimulated with serum, heparin blocks the induction of c-fos seen at 15 min. Because heparin is taken up by cells over a much longer time course, we addressed mechanisms whereby extracellular heparin might suppress c-fos induction at such early times. Quiescent cells were treated with serum, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, or low concentrations of Ca2+ ionophores that produced increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the physiological range. Each treatment caused an increase in c-fos mRNA, but they did so by different mechanisms. Serum activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and increased [Ca2+]i without affecting protein kinase C. Activation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester activated MAPK without much effect on [Ca2+]i. Ionophores increased [Ca2+]i without affecting basal levels of protein kinase C or MAPK. Heparin (1 µg/ml) suppressed the induction of c-fos initiated by all three treatments. It did not affect the activity of protein kinase C, but inhibited activation of MAPK by either serum or phorbol ester, suggesting a common site of action at or below the probable convergence of the induced signals at Ras/Raf-1 activation. Heparin also inhibited the serum-stimulated entry of extracellular Ca2+ to the same extent as verapamil, consistent with the ability of verapamil to block L-type Ca2+ channels and the known presence of these channels in mesangial cells. However, this effect does not appear to be related to heparin's ability to inhibit induction of c-fos. First, verapamil had no effect on induction of c-fos by serum. Second, heparin had no effect on changes in [Ca2+]i achieved by ionophores. We conclude that heparin suppresses induction of c-fos in mesangial cells by blocking at least two different points in signal transduction cascades, one upstream of MAPK and the other independent of MAPK, but dependent on intracellular Ca2+.

It is well known that heparin exerts antimitogenic and antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells (1Castellot Jr., J.J. Beeler D.J. Rosenberg R.D. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell.

Additional evidence for this was obtained by showing that residual serum-stimulated proliferation was insensitive to heparin in smooth muscle cells in which PKC had been down-regulated by prolonged treatment with phorbol ester (7Pukac L.A.

Mesangial cells are resident smooth muscle-like cells of the renal glomerulus that participate in regulating glomerular filtration and hence function. Normally quiescent, mesangial cells adopt a proliferating smooth muscle phenotype in a number of animal models of progressive renal disease (9Floege J. Johnson R.J. Couser W.G. Klin.

Eng E. Young B.A. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 369-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that both heparin and mesangial cell-derived heparan sulfates inhibit serum-stimulated proliferation of cultured mesangial cells at concentrations as low as 100 ng/ml (13Wang A. Templeton D.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 69: 437-448Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As in smooth muscle cells, this response at least partly involves inhibition of PKC signaling because these concentrations of heparin inhibited the induction of c-fos by phorbol ester. Because the inhibition of c-fos expression is seen as early as 15 min, before significant amounts of heparin have entered the cell, we proposed that interaction of heparin with cell-surface receptors is responsible (13Wang A. Templeton D.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 69: 437-448Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Heparin binds with high affinity to the α1-subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel (14Knaus H.-G. Scheffauer F. Romanin C. Schindler H.-G. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11156-11166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and blocks uptake of 45Ca2+ through this channel at an extracellular site (15Knaus H.-G. Moshammer T. Friedrich K. Kang H.C.

Intracellular heparin also inhibits binding of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate to its receptor and the subsequent release of intracellular Ca2+ (16Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S.

J. 1994; 303: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PKC-α is activated by Ca2+, and other isoforms of PKC act synergistically with Ca2+ to initiate intracellular signaling cascades (18Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar). Therefore, one aspect of heparin's effect on PKC-dependent processes may be through effects on Ca2+ signaling. This study was undertaken to examine the role of Ca2+ signaling in the inhibition of c-fos induction by heparin. NuSerum was a product of Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). Other culture media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Gibco/BRL (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). The radioisotopes [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (>4000 Ci/mmol) were from Du Pont Canada (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA), respectively. Fura-2/AM was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Verapamil, ionomycin, A23187, Pluronic F-127, and staurosporine were from Sigma. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Heparin, chondroitin sulfate type C (shark cartilage), and dextran sulfate (average molecular mass of 500 kDa) were from Sigma. Because commercial heparin preparations show batch-to-batch variation in their antiproliferative effects (19Zvibel I. Halay E. Reid L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a single lot (product No. 50H0010) of Sigma bovine lung heparin (average molecular mass of 15 kDa) was used for all experiments. We have previously shown that this product is of comparable antimitogenic potency to heparan sulfate chains isolated from rat mesangial cell cultures (20Wang A. Fan M.-Y. Templeton D.M. J. Cell.

AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor was from Sigma (product No. P0300), and affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-rat Erk-2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Myelin basic protein was a generous gift from Dr. Mario Moscarello (Hospital for Sick Children). A rat c-fos cDNA was cloned by T. Curran (22Curran T. Gordon M.B. Rubino K.L. Sambucetti L.C.

Aclar plastic coverslips (25 × 0.005 mm) were obtained from Proplastic Inc. (Linden, NJ). The Promega RNAgents total RNA isolation kit was from Fisher, and the random primer kit was from Gibco/BRL. An ECL Western blotting detection system was obtained from Amersham Canada (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Hybond-N nylon membranes were from Amersham Canada, and polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Bio-Rad. Quik Hyb hybridization solution was a product of Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Rat mesangial cells were cultured from glomeruli isolated by sieving kidneys of 100-150-g male Wistar rats. Cellular outgrowths in RPMI 1640 medium containing 17% FBS were identified as mesangial cells by their characteristic morphology, cytoskeletal components, and contractile properties as described previously (13Wang A. Templeton D.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 69: 437-448Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Wang A. Fan M.-Y. Templeton D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were passaged by trypsinization and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), and 10% FBS. All experiments were performed using the cells between passages 5 and 15. Quiescence was induced by transferring cultures at ∼30% confluence (2 × 104 cells/cm2) to medium with 0.4% FBS for 48 h prior to stimulation with medium supplemented with 5% NuSerum, TPA, or ionophores. Intracellular Ca2+ measurements were performed as described previously (23McDermott G.F. Hurst R.D. Whiteside C.I. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluence (3-4 days) on Aclar coverslips and loaded with fura-2/AM (2 µM) for 40 min at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 µl/ml Pluronic F-127. The coverslips were mounted in a chamber containing 1.5 ml of modified Krebs-Henseleit/HEPES solution (130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 5.5 mMD-glucose, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) with 0.8 mM Mg2SO4 and 0.1% albumin and placed in the sample compartment of a Nikon Diaphot-TMD inverted microscope at 37°C. Test agents were introduced by rapid infusion with a 21-gauge × 3/4-inch needle. Fluorescence intensity (F) at 500 nm was measured with alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm in a Spex DM3000 spectrofluorometer. For calibration, maximum fluorescence (Fmax) was determined by the addition of 2.5 mM Ca2+ and 25 µM ionomycin at the end of each experiment. Autofluorescence (Fauto) was analyzed by adding 8 mM Mn2+ to quench fura-2 fluorescence and was subtracted from all signals. The unquenched fluorescence in the presence of EGTA (Fmin) is a constant fraction of the corrected maximum signal (Fmax− Fauto) when the dye is saturated with Ca2+ and was found to be 0.07 × (Fmax− Fauto). Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was calculated as follows: [Ca2+] = Kd·(F′− Fmin)/(Fmax− F′), where F′ = F − Fauto and the Kd for fura-2 is 224 nM (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates at 2 × 104 cells/well, and after 16 h, the FBS content of the medium was decreased to 0.4% for 48 h. The cells were then washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium, treated under various conditions for 15 min, washed twice again, and incubated for 10 min at 30°C in 40 µl of reaction solution (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM Na2HPO4, 0.4 mM KH2PO4, 25 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 5.5 mMD-glucose, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM CaCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 100 µM ATP, and 50 µg/ml digitonin, pH 7.2) containing 120 µg/ml peptide VRKRTLRRL and 10 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP as described (21Williams B. Schrier R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2889-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Each reaction was terminated by adding 20 µl of ice-cold 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid on ice and spotted onto phosphocellulose circles prewashed sequentially with water, buffer, and 75 mM phosphoric acid. After standing for 15 min at room temperature, the circles were washed (4 min each with gentle shaking) three times in 75 mM phosphoric acid and once in 2.75 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, before liquid scintillation counting. Quiescent cells in 10-cm Petri dishes were treated under varying conditions for the times indicated in individual experiments and then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 800 µl of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 µg/ml leupeptin), and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM Na3VO4 and 1 mM NaF). Cells were sonicated for 5 s (Branson Model W-350 sonifier) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min. Cytosol was assayed for protein by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar), and aliquots containing ∼500 µg of protein were precleared by adding 1.0 µg of normal rabbit IgG with 20 µl of protein A-Sepharose and centrifuging for 5 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was incubated with 2 µg of anti-Erk-2 antibody for 3 h at 4°C, and immunoprecipitates were recovered by incubation with a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose for a further 2 h. Portions of the immunoprecipitates were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blotting with anti-Erk-2 antibody and detection with an Amersham ECL detection system. MAPK activity was determined by phosphorylation of the specific substrate myelin basic protein (MBP) (27Ahn N.G. Weiel J.E. Chan C.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were mixed with 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml MBP, 2 µM AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, 50 µM ATP, and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30°C for 20 min. Reaction mixtures were mixed with 2 × sample buffer for electrophoresis according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and separated on 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for silver staining and autoradiography. Total RNA was isolated from synchronized cells in 75-cm2 culture plates by lysis in guanidinium isothiocyanate and extraction with phenol/chloroform using a Promega RNAgents kit. Equal amounts of RNA (∼10 µg) were denatured by the method of Gong (28Gong Z. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 74-75PubMed Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-agarose gels (1.2% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM NaOAc, and 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0), and transferred by overnight capillary blotting to Hybond-N nylon membranes. Membranes were prehybridized for 15 min at 65°C in Quik Hyb solution, and hybridization was carried out at 65°C for 1 h in Quik Hyb solution containing 500 µg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA and a c-fos cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method. After hybridization, blots were washed twice for 15 min at 42°C in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and once for 30 min in 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and for an additional 30 min in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. Levels of mRNA were quantitated by densitometry of Northern blot autoradiographs and normalized to 28 S rRNA visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. We previously reported that stimulation of quiescent mesangial cells with either serum or the phorbol ester TPA causes a transient and heparin-sensitive induction of c-fos mRNA with levels measurable by Northern blotting at 15-120 min (13Wang A. Templeton D.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 69: 437-448Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in the present study, where heparin (1 µg/ml) suppressed the serum-dependent increase in c-fos mRNA by ∼60% and the TPA-induced signal to approximately the same extent (Fig. 1 and Table I). Because TPA activates Ca2+-dependent processes, whereas heparin binds to L-type Ca2+ channels and inhibits inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (see “Discussion”), we examined whether heparin might be affecting c-fos expression through Ca2+ signaling events.Table IEffect of various agents on c-fos mRNA levelsTreatmentc-fos mRNAn%&controlSerum1005Serum&+&heparin40.6&±&9.45Serum&+&chondroitin sulfate94&±&92Serum&+&dextran sulfate65&±&82Verapamil41Serum&+&verapamil101&±&382TPA1006TPA&+&heparin43.3&±&8.56TPA&+&verapamil241&±&1192Ionomycin55&±&132Ionomycin&+&heparin11&±&22A2318752&±&82A23187&+&heparin25&±&32 Open table in a new tab Stimulation of quiescent cells with NuSerum caused a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i from a base-line value of 108 ± 37 nM (mean ± S.D.) to a peak (phase I) of 300 ± 141 nM (p < 0.0005, n = 11). This was followed by a sustained signal above the base line (phase II), measuring 216 ± 79 nM (p < 0.001 versus base line) at 75 s after addition of serum (Fig. 2 and Table II). EGTA completely obliterated the sustained signal, with base-line levels achieved by 75 s, consistent with the interpretation that phase I represents mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores, while phase II depends on entry of extracellular Ca2+. Also consistent with this interpretation, the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist verapamil diminished phase II without affecting phase I (Table II). When heparin was added with serum, the peak rise in [Ca2+]i (phase I) was not significantly changed (280 ± 102 nM; n = 14), but phase II was decreased from ∼60% of the phase I value at 75 s to ∼30% (p < 0.001) (Table II). Chondroitin sulfate (a glycosaminoglycan control) had no effect on [Ca2+]i (Table II) and did not diminish serum-induced levels of c-fos mRNA (data not shown). Dextran sulfate, an unrelated polyanion that we reported earlier to have variable effects on [3H]thymidine incorporation in mesangial cells (13Wang A. Templeton D.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 69: 437-448Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar), likewise did not affect the serum-induced Ca2+ signal, but did decrease c-fos mRNA levels relative to serum controls.Table II.Effects of various treatments on intracellular Ca2+ levelsTreatment[Ca2+]iPhase II/phase IpnBase linePhase IPhase IInm%Serum108&±&37300&±&141216&±&7960&±&2411Serum&+&EGTA47&±&2126&±&1648&±&21.8&±&0.32Serum&+&verapamil (8&µM)78&±&27256&±&24131&±&2231&±&9NSaNS, not significant.3Serum&+&heparin102&±&42280&±&102149&±&4529&±&16<0.00114Serum&+&chondroitin sulfate154&±&88318&±&173228&±&7850&±&17NS4Serum&+&dextran sulfate113&±&41208&±&69157&±&5746&±&15NS4TPA80&±&13152&±&41146&±&3695&±&170.015TPA&+&heparin81&±&6178&±&36134&±&3252&±&16NS3a NS, not significant. Open table in a new tab Stimulating cells with TPA also caused a rapid and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, although of a more modest degree than elicited by serum. Although it is not clear that this represents a typical two-phase signal, we quantitated the sustained phase after 75 s for comparison with serum. While heparin did not significantly affect either the initial increase in [Ca2+]i or the sustained phase after addition of TPA, it caused a decrease in their ratio, back to a value observed with serum (Table II). Because heparin inhibited c-fos induction by both serum and TPA and also diminished the sustained Ca2+ signal (relative to the initial signal) elicited by both, we sought to determine whether sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i was sufficient to bring about c-fos induction. Ionomycin (100 nM) caused a plateau in [Ca2+]i of 382 ± 64 nM (Fig. 3). Heparin failed to block this increase, with [Ca2+]i reaching 410 ± 130 nM in the presence of ionomycin and 1 µg/ml heparin. Ionomycin induced c-fos expression in quiescent cells at 30 min, and heparin inhibited the induction (Fig. 4 and Table I). Very similar results were obtained with a second Ca2+ ionophore: A23187 (500 nM) increased [Ca2+]i transiently to ∼300 nM, and heparin actually increased this value to ∼450 nM (Fig. 3). This concentration of A23187 caused an increase in c-fos mRNA that was partially suppressed by heparin (Fig. 4 and Table I).Fig. 4Effect of ionophores on c-fos mRNA. Northern blots of total RNA were hybridized with labeled c-fos cDNA probe. A: RNA was isolated from quiescent cells (lane i) or 30 min after treatment (lanes ii-v) as follows: lane ii, 5% serum; lane iii, 5% serum + 1 µg/ml heparin; lane iv, 100 nM ionomycin; lane v, 100 nM ionomycin + 1 µg/ml heparin. Results from several experiments such as those shown here were corrected for 28 S rRNA, and the data are compiled in Table I. B: lane i, 500 nM A23187; lane ii, 500 nM A23187 + 1 µg/ml heparin. In lanes iii-vi, cells were held in 0.5% serum for 72 h instead of the usual 48 h used to induce quiescence, and 200 ng/ml TPA was added during the last 24 h to the cells in lanes v and vi to down-regulate PKC. RNA was isolated 30 min after treatment with either ionomycin (lanes iii and v) or A23187 (lanes iv and vi). Down-regulation of PKC with TPA did not block ionophore induction of c-fos (compare lanes iii and v and lanes iv and vi).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above results suggest that heparin can block serum-stimulated entry of extracellular Ca2+ (phase II) as well as depress induction of c-fos by serum, phorbol esters, and Ca2+ ionophores, but that these two events may be unrelated. If prevention of sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i is responsible for the effect of heparin on c-fos induction, abolition of phase II with verapamil should have a similar effect. Therefore, we measured c-fos mRNA levels after stimulation with either serum or TPA in the presence of verapamil. The results are summarized in Table I. Verapamil alone caused only slight increases in c-fos mRNA. Verapamil had no effect on the response of c-fos mRNA to serum and actually increased the levels in the presence of TPA as compared with TPA alone. Because heparin blocks induction of c-fos by both ionophores and TPA, we considered whether the ionophores could be signaling through Ca2+-dependent isoforms of PKC. Serum, heparin, or a combination of serum and heparin had no effect on the levels of PKC activity observed in quiescent cells, while staurosporine decreased activity below these basal levels (Fig. 5). TPA caused an ∼5-fold increase in PKC activity that was heparin-insensitive, but inhibited by staurosporine. Ionophores failed to activate PKC and actually produced a decrease below the basal levels observed in quiescent cells. To further assess the involvement of PKC, cells were rendered quiescent for 48 h as in all above experiments and then maintained under low serum conditions for an additional 24 h in the presence of 200 ng/ml TPA to down-regulate PKC. Under these circumstances, PKC activity was decreased below basal levels in quiescent cells and failed to respond to TPA, serum, or ionophores (Fig. 6). The additional 24 h of serum starvation used in this protocol had no effect on the response of the cells to ionophores; both ionophores increased c-fos mRNA to ∼50% of the level attained with serum in both the 48-h (Table I) and 72-h (Fig. 4) protocols. Down-regulation of PKC had no effect on the response to ionophores, indicating that, consistent with their failure to activate PKC, they do not act through PKC to induce c-fos. Consistently, down-regulation did not affect induction of c-fos by ionophores (Fig. 4B). MAPK activity was tested in cells treated with serum, TPA, and ionomycin. Similar amounts of immunoprecipitable Erk-2 were recovered before and after each treatment (Fig. 7A). However, as expected, both serum and TPA caused an increase in immunoprecipitable MAPK activity (Fig. 7B) that was maximal between 1 and 2 min (data not shown). Ionomycin, on the other hand, failed to produce measurable activity. Heparin caused a decrease in MAPK activity induced by either serum or TPA (Fig. 7), consistent with blockade of c-fos-inducing signals at or upstream of MAPK. Heparin added directly to the immunoprecipitation reaction mixture did not affect recovery of protein (Fig. 7A), and heparin added to the kinase assay did not alter measured activity (data not shown), so any heparin that might have remained associated with the cells upon harvesting is not a confounding factor in these experiments. Heparin microinjected into cells or added to permeabilized cells blocks inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate intracellular receptor binding and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-dependent Ca2+ release (16Worley P.F.

Acute addition of heparin to cell cultures has no such effect, consistent with our previous conclusion that uptake of effective concentrations of heparin by cells is slow relative to the time course of Ca2+ signaling and c-fos induction (13Wa"

https://openalex.org/W2063296286,"In this report, we have analyzed the function of two Sp1 sites present in the epithelium-specific MUC1 promoter. Using promoter-reporter gene (CAT) constructs, we found that mutagenesis of either of the Sp1 binding motifs at −576/−568 and −99/−90, reduced transcription in MUC1-expressing epithelial cell lines. However, abolition of the binding site at −99/−91 by mutagenesis also resulted in increased transcriptional activity in non-epithelial cell lines, suggesting involvement of the site in tissue-specific expression. In vitro binding assays revealed a novel binding motif at −101/−89 (AGGGGGCGGGGTT), which overlaps but differs from the Sp1 consensus motif by having an adenine residue in the 5′-flanking sequence. The 5′-flanking sequence appeared to be important for binding of an Sp1-unrelated factor (SpA) but not for binding of Sp1. Site-directed mutagenesis of the motif into a site able to bind Sp1, but unable to bind SpA, resulted in an increased level of transcription of the CAT reporter gene in all cell lines tested, suggesting a repressive effect of the novel factor on transcription. The ratio between the Sp1 and SpA binding activity in nuclear extracts correlated with both promoter activity and the levels of endogenous transcription in different breast cancer cell lines. Our results are consistent with the idea that the relative activities of the two factors may be involved in the up-regulation of expression of the MUC1 gene seen in breast and other carcinomas.

The human polymorphic epithelial mucin (MUC1) belongs to a family of heavily glycosylated molecules expressed by glandular epithelial cells. To date eight human mucin genes have been identified, which show different profiles of expression in epithelial tissues (1Gendler S. Spicer A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Google Scholar). In the case of MUC1, the gene is widely expressed at the apical surface of most glandular epithelial cells lining glands or ducts, but not by mesenchymal cells, squamous epithelia or liver (2Burchell J. Gendler S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Girling A. Lewis A. Millis R. Lamport D. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5476-5482Google Scholar, 3Zotter S. Hageman P.C. Lossnitzer A. Mooi W.J. Hilgers J. Cancer Rev. 1988; 11-12: 55-101Google Scholar). In addition to exhibiting epithelium-specific expression, other levels of regulation of the gene are observed. Thus, in the breast, expression is dramatically increased by at least 10-fold at lactation and in breast cancers (3Zotter S. Hageman P.C. Lossnitzer A. Mooi W.J. Hilgers J. Cancer Rev. 1988; 11-12: 55-101Google Scholar, 4Girling A. Bartkova J. Burchell J. Gendler S. Gillet C. Taylor-Papadimitriou J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1072-1076Google Scholar). The increased expression in malignancy is also seen in ovarian cancer and in some lung cancers, making the MUC1 gene product an important target antigen for therapies based on antibodies or immunotherapy (5Taylor-Papadimitriou J.T. Stewart L. Burchell J. Beverly P. Annal. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 690: 69-79Google Scholar). The increased expression of the MUC1 gene seen in breast cancers is paralleled by an increase in the expression of the corresponding messenger RNA, which probably reflects an increase in gene transcription (6Abe M. Kufe D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 226-231Google Scholar). Similarly, tissue specificity of expression is also seen at the level of mRNA. Therefore an analysis of the elements of the MUC1 promoter and the factors interacting with these elements that play a role in regulation of expression of MUC1 in epithelial cells and in tumors is of interest. Such an analysis should yield information that is useful not only for the understanding of how expression of the gene is regulated, but also for the design of a MUC1-based promoter for targeting genes to carcinomas. We have reported accurate tissue-specific expression of the human MUC1 gene in transgenic mice using a genomic fragment containing 1.6 kilobases of 5′-flanking sequence (7Peat N. Gendler S.J. Lalani E.-N. Duhig T. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1954-1960Google Scholar). Expression of the gene was strongly up-regulated at lactation and in mammary tumors developing in the transgenic mice cross-fostered on mouse mammary tumor virus-producing mice (8Graham R.A. Stewart L.S. Peat N.P. Beverley P. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Tumor Targeting. 1995; 1: 211-221Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro functional studies have identified a minimal promoter of around 600 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction. upstream from the transcription starting site (9Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Google Scholar, 10Abe M. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 282-286Google Scholar). These studies showed that the most important regions controlling transcription in breast cancer cell lines appear to lie between nucleotides −600/−400 and −150/−60, respectively. The former region contains enhancing elements able to transactivate heterologous promoters, and some of these elements have been shown to respond to exogenous stimuli (11Shirotani K. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Gendler S.J. Irimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15030-15035Google Scholar). Sequences between −150/+33 appear to contain elements involved in inhibiting expression in non-expressing cells since they direct tissue-specific expression when coupled to a foreign enhancer. These results indicate that the regulation of MUC1 expression is controlled by several transactivating factors. base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of the MUC1 promoter is highly GC-rich and contains several potential Sp1 binding sites (9Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Google Scholar, 12Vos H.L. de Vries Y. Hilkens J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 121-130Google Scholar) and at least one such site is located within each of the two regions of the promoter known to contain functional elements (−600/−400 and −150/−60). Sp1 sites have been shown to be functional in many housekeeping gene promoters, with the transcription factor acting as strong activators (13Dynan W.S. Sazek S. Tjian R. Schimke R.T. Nature. 1986; 319: 246-248Google Scholar, 14Anderson G.M. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1935-1943Google Scholar). These sites are found less frequently in tissue-specific promoters where their role in transcription of regulation is less well defined. In considering the role of Sp1 sites in regulation of transcription, the existence of a family of proteins able to bind the same core element (GGGCGG) (15Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4561Google Scholar, 16Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Google Scholar, 17Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Kuriyama Y.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Google Scholar) suggests that complex interactions of several factors may be involved in tissue-specific gene expression. In this study we have investigated the role of two high affinity Sp1 sites in the upstream and close proximal regions. Mutational analysis of the upstream Sp1 site demonstrated an important function for this sequence as an enhancing element. Analysis of the proximal Sp1 site at −99/−90 on the other hand suggested that in addition to Sp1 another factor could also bind to this element and negatively regulate expression of a reporter gene. The binding site has been termed SpA since it contains adenosine in the 5′ sequence flanking the Sp1 core recognition sequence. The data suggest that the SpA factor is involved in determining the level of expression of the MUC1 gene in breast epithelial cells by acting as a negative regulator of transcription, and that reduced activity of SpA may contribute to the increase in MUC1 expression seen in breast cancers. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene constructs were developed using the basic pGCAT-A vector (18Frebourg T. Brison O. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 315-318Google Scholar) and a promoterless pEnCAT vector (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis of Sp1 sites was done by recombinant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a pBS-Bluescript construct with 1.4 kilobases of 5′ upstream MUC1 sequences cloned into the SmaI site (8Graham R.A. Stewart L.S. Peat N.P. Beverley P. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Tumor Targeting. 1995; 1: 211-221Google Scholar). In the first step, the PCR was run in two separate reactions using: 1) a T3 oligonucleotide primer and a mutated upper strand primer and 2) a T7 primer with a mutated bottom strand primer. The sequences of only the upper strand of the mutated oligonucleotides are here shown with mutated nucleotides underlined: −107/−87, 5′-TAGGGGAGGGCGGGGTTTT-3′ (proximal Sp1 site); −586/−562: 5′-AAGTCCGGCTGGCGGGGACTGTG-3′ (distal Sp1 site). The PCRs yielded fragments of the expected length that were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, electroeluted (Biotrap, Schleicher & Schuell), and ethanol-precipitated. To obtain the integrated mutant promoter, approximately one half of the corresponding products were mixed and used as a template in a second step PCR run with T3 and T7 primers. The products were digested with KpnI/BamHI and inserted into the KpnI/BamHI-linearized pGCAT-A vector. Recombinant clones were sequenced over the mutated regions by the dideoxy method (Sequenase version 2, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). A series of deletion mutants were generated by amplification of relevant regions using −150/−134, −134/−117, −117/−98, −106/−88 forward, and +16/+33 reverse MUC1 primers, respectively. The PCR products were inserted into the SmaI site (dT-tailed) of the pBS-Bluescript vector, sequenced, and subcloned into the XbaI/PstI sites of pEnCAT. The mutant M1 construct of the −150/+33 sequence in pEnCAT was obtained by amplification using a mutant 63-bp primer of the −150/−88 MUC1 sequence (for the M1 mutation − see Table I).Table IWild type and mutant oligonucleotides covering Sp1 sites in the MUC-1 promoterSp1 consensusATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGSp1 site at −576/−567−582−561WT MUC1 (OL1)5′-CCGGCTGGGGCGGGGACTGTGG-3′M65′-CCGGCTGGCGGGGACTGTGG-3′Sp1 site at −99/−90−118−84WT MUC15′GAGGTAGGAGGTAGGGGAGGGGGCGGGGTTTTGTC 3′−114−89OL2TAGGAGGTAGGGGAGGGGGCGGGGTTM1TAGGAGGTAGGGGCTGGGGCGGGGTTM2TAGGAGGTAGGAGGGGGCGGGGTTM4TAGGAGGTAGGGGAGGGCGGGGTT−118−101OL3GAGGTAGGAGGTAGGGGA−107−87OL-4TAGGGGAGGGGGCGGGGTTTTM3TAGGGGAGGGGGCGCGGTTTT−103−84OL-5GGAGGGGGCGGGGTTTTGTCM5GGAGGGGGCGGGGCTTTGTCProposed target sequence (SpA)AGGGGGCGGGG Open table in a new tab Plasmid DNA for transfections was obtained using equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl-ethidium bromide density gradients.

Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Google Scholar) overnight (T47D, ZR-75 cells) or for 4-6 h (MCF-7, HT1080, HTB96) on cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 10 µg of the CAT construct DNA together with 2 µg of the luciferase expression plasmid pJ3Luc were used for each 60-mm dish, and duplicate dishes were analyzed for each sample in individual experiments. The luciferase activity in each aliquot was measured immediately after the lysis using an LKB 1251 luminometer. CAT activity was analyzed by acetylation of chloramphenicol and solvent extraction of the radiolabeled product (20Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-256Google Scholar). For each reaction, approximately one-eighth of the total cellular lysate obtained from one 60-mm dish was used and reaction was carried out with 0.1 µCi of 14C-labeled acetyl coenzyme A (usually about 10-40% of acetyl coenzyme A was converted into acetylchloramphenicol). Transcription activities have been expressed as the ratio of CAT and luciferase activity (cpm/time unit: luciferase units). All experiments were performed at least three times with two different plasmid preparations. In experiments where the CAT activity of the mutant and wild type construct was compared, the plasmid DNAs were prepared at the same time since we observed a significant decrease of transcription activity after prolonged storage of the constructs. Cells were harvested 40-48 h after the transfection and lysed immediately with buffer containing 0.65% Nonidet P-40. Approximately 5 × 108-109 cells were trypsinized, collected, and washed once with cold phosphate-buffed saline. Cells were then lysed in a 50-ml Falcon tube for 30 min at 4°C with 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 1 mM EDTA. Nuclei were pelleted at 2000 × g for 5 min and washed once with buffer that did not contain the detergent. Nuclear proteins were extracted from the final pellet with one volume (packed volume of cell pellet) of high salt extraction buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol) for 30 min at 4°C with occasional shaking. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation (twice at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C) in an Eppendorf tube. The protein concentration was estimated by the Bio-Rad Bradford assay. In most preparations the protein concentration was 3-4 µg/µl. All buffers contained protease inhibitors in the following concentrations: 0.5 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM benzimidine, and 1 µg/ml leupeptin. The nuclear proteins were kept at −70°C and used without dialysis in band shift assays. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were used in bandshift assays as probes (see Table I for sequences). Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared using cyanoethyl chemistry (Clare Hall Laboratories, Imperial Cancer Research Fund) and annealed by heating to 80°C for 3 min and then slowly cooled down to room temperature. 2-4 pmol of annealed oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ ends with 10-20 µCi of [gamma-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp., >5,000 Ci/mmol) in a T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction, gel-purified, electroeluted, and concentrated by a triple spin in a Centricon 10 ultraconcentrator (Amicon Corp.). A 20-µl binding mixture contained: 15,000-30,000 cpm of end-labeled oligonucleotide probe, 4% glycerol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 µg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), and 2-4 µg of nuclear proteins. The binding reaction was performed for 20-30 min at 4°C. Unlabeled competitors or antisera were incubated with the binding mixture for 5 min at 4°C prior to the addition of probe. For the detection of Sp1 binding, a specific polyclonal rabbit antiserum (2892-E provided by Dr. Steven Jackson, Institute of Cancer and Development Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used at a dilution of 1:40. The retarded complexes were electrophoretically separated on 6% native polyacrylamide gels (1:37.5, bisacrylamide to acrylamide ratio) at 75 V at room temperature. The dried gels were exposed to film for 6-16 h. Most cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. For cultivation of MCF-7 cells, RPMI 1640 medium was used. Culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and glutamine. The MUC1-expressing cell lines were derived from breast adenocarcinomas (ZR-75, MCF-7, and T47D); the non-expressing cell lines were derived from a human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) and an osteosarcoma (HTB96). The promoter of the MUC1 gene is GC-rich and among the several GC boxes are two core Sp1 sites (GGGGCGGGG) at positions −576/−568 and −99/−91 (8Graham R.A. Stewart L.S. Peat N.P. Beverley P. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Tumor Targeting. 1995; 1: 211-221Google Scholar, 11Shirotani K. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Gendler S.J. Irimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15030-15035Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of these sites to the regulation of transcription, null mutations were introduced into the core sequence (GGCGG converted to TTCGG) in each case (see Table I, mutations M6 and M4). Oligonucleotides with the mutated sequence did not form specific complexes with either the purified Sp1 protein or with nuclear extracts from expressing and non-expressing cells (data not shown and 14Anderson G.M. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1935-1943Google Scholar). The same mutations were introduced into reporter gene constructs in a pGCAT-A-based vector containing 1400 bp of 5′ MUC1 flanking sequence (−1400/+33) and transiently transfected cells were examined for expression of the CAT gene. A correction for transfection efficiency was applied by co-transfecting a luciferase plasmid (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 1, Fig. 2 show the level of expression of CAT in breast cancer cell lines that constitutively express the MUC1 gene and in cell lines that do not express the gene. The data show that the effect of mutations in the distal Sp1 site (Fig. 1) was deleterious to promoter activity in all the cell lines. In contrast, the mutation in the proximal Sp1 site showed a different effect in MUC1-expressing and non-expressing cell lines (Fig. 2 and 9Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Google Scholar). In the breast cancer cell lines, transcription was inhibited, whereas in the non-expressing HT1080 cell line, the reporter gene was expressed at a higher level than seen with the wild type construct. In the non-expressing HTB96 cell line, the transcriptional activity was relatively unchanged (80-90% of wild type).Fig. 2Effect of mutation of the core of the Sp1 site at −99/−90 on the activity of the MUC1 promoter. The GG at −97/−96 was mutated to TT in a 1.4-kilobase fragment of MUC1 5′ regulatory sequence to create the M4 mutation (see Table I). A construct expressing the reporter CAT gene driven by the wild type (WT) and mutated promoter (M4) were transfected into MUC1-expressing (ZR-75, T47D, and MCF-7) and non-expressing (HT1080 and HTB96) cells, together with the luciferase plasmid and expression of the reporter genes assayed. Standard deviations within and between experiments are as for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To see whether the two putative Sp1 binding sites were binding the same or different proteins, gel shift assays were performed. Using an oligonucleotide covering the sequence from −582 to −561 (OL-1; see Table I) as a probe, complexes were formed with nuclear extracts from both expressing and non-expressing cells, which could be competed out by either the self oligonucleotide or an Sp1 consensus sequence (Fig. 3). Using an oligonucleotide covering the proximal Sp1 site (−114/−89, OL-2; Table I), four major complexes C1-C4 were formed with extracts from both MUC1-expressing (ZR-75) and non-expressing (HT1080) cells (Fig. 4A). The fifth faster migrating complex indicated with an asterisk could represent degradation products of C1-C4 complexes, nonspecific binding, or both. Complexes C1, C3, and C4, but not C2, could be competed out using the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide shown in Table I. Moreover, after preincubation of the nuclear extract with antiserum to the Sp1 transcription factor, the C1 complex was reduced and a high molecular weight complex that did not enter the gel appeared. This suggests that the C1 complex was formed by binding of the Sp1 factor to OL-2. The C2 complex is of particular interest since it could not be competed out by the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide, and did not appear to be affected with antiserum to Sp1 (Fig. 4B). OL-2 is 26 bp long, and it was possible that C2 was formed by a protein binding to sequences flanking the Sp1 core recognition site. To determine the precise position of protein binding, overlapping oligonucleotides (OL-3, OL-4, and OL-5; see Table I) were used as competitors in a band shift assay using OL-2 as the labeled probe. To visualize only the C2 complex, all incubations contained an excess of the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide. Fig. 4B shows that only the oligonucleotides OL-4 and OL-5 containing the Sp1 site showed effective competition with OL-2, while sequences 5′ to the core Sp1 recognition sequence (−118/−101) were ineffective in competing out the complex. Fig. 4 suggests that there is a factor in nuclear extracts that binds to the sequence −102/−89 of the MUC −1 promoter containing the sequence GGGGCGGGG, but not to the consensus Sp1 sequence. Based on the reasoning that the specificity of binding might be governed by nucleotides flanking the core Sp1 recognition site, mutant oligonucleotides were prepared and tested for their ability to compete with binding of the wild type −114/−89 probe (OL-2). As with the experiments reported in Fig. 4B, all reactions contained excess consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide to give maximum exposure of the C2 complex. Fig. 5 shows the results of the gel shift assay, and it can be seen that oligonucleotides containing mutations in the Sp1 hexanucleotide core motif GGGCGG (M3 and M4; Table I) did not compete, thus emphasizing the importance of the Sp1 core. However, oligonucleotide M1, which contains mutations in the 5′-AG dinucleotide at −101 and −100, flanking the core did not compete out the C2 complex either, while it did compete for the Sp1 specific bands (data not shown). On the other hand, the mutation M5 at residue −90, 3′ to the Sp1 core motif (21Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Google Scholar), did not reduce the ability of OL-5 to compete with the formation of the C2 complex. The above data suggest that a higher sequence stringency 5′ to the Sp1 core motif is required for binding of the novel factor than is required for binding of Sp1. As the factor requires an adenosine residue 5′ of the Sp1 binding motif, we propose to call the factor SpA. As shown in Fig. 5, changing the AG dinucleotide 5′ to the Sp1 core sequence into CT (mutation M1) abolishes binding of the SpA factor, while the ability to bind Sp1 is retained. To study the function of the SpA motif in MUC1 promoter activity, the M1 mutation was introduced into a CAT reporter gene construct. We have previously found that a construct in the pEnCAT vector containing the SV40 enhancer and −150/+33 bp of the MUC1 gene sequence gives epithelium-specific expression of CAT in transient transfection experiments (9Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Google Scholar). The M1 mutation was introduced into this construct, and the activity of the promoter compared to that of the wild type construct in different cell lines. The results, illustrated in Fig. 6, show that in all the cell lines examined, the mutant construct displayed higher expression of the CAT reporter gene compared to the wild type construct, suggesting a role for the SpA factor in reducing the level of transcription. Gel shift experiments using nuclear extracts from various cell lines showed that the SpA factor is widely expressed (Fig. 7A). We determined the relative ratio between the Sp1 and SpA binding activity on the basis of phosphorimaging data obtained by counting radioactivity in the Sp1- and SpA-specific complexes in different cell lines (Fig. 7B). The data have been collected from two independent experiments in which different nuclear extracts preparations were used. The highest SpA/Sp1 ratio was seen in the MCF-7 cell line, which correlates with the observation that the largest increase in transcription with the M1 mutant form of the promoter was seen in this cell line (see Fig. 6). Although tissue-specific expression of the CAT gene can be obtained with 150 bp of 5′ upstream sequences of the MUC1 gene working with the SV40 enhancer in the pEnCAT vector (9Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Google Scholar), we have previously found that deletion of the promoter sequences to −60 results in loss of transcriptional activity in MUC1-expressing cells. We now find that deletion of the promoter sequences to only −107 results in increased transcription of the CAT gene (as compared to the −150 construct) in both expressing and non-expressing cells. The data, shown in Fig. 8 suggest the presence of silencing elements between −150 and −107. To test whether such a silencing effect could be obtained with a heterologous promoter, the sequences between −150 and −107 were cloned into the BglII site of a CAT construct driven by the SV40 promoter and enhancer. However, no decrease in transcription was observed, suggesting that the specific sequences were modifying the function of downstream MUC1 specific regulatory elements (data not shown). The effect of the presence or absence of the sequences between −150 and −107 on the complexes formed in gel shift analysis was examined by using two oligonucleotides, one containing these sequences (−150/−89) and a shorter oligonucleotide without upstream sequences (−107/−89). Fig. 9 shows that the dominant complex formed with the longer oligonucleotide appeared to be due to binding of the SpA factor, the Sp1 complex being of lower abundance. In contrast, when the short oligonucleotide was used, the predominant complex formed was with Sp1, the SpA complex only becoming apparent when the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide was present in excess. In this report we have focused on the analysis of two Sp1 sites in the MUC1 promoter located in regions previously characterized as being functionally important at −576/−567 and −99/−90, respectively. The functional role of the two Sp1 sites was assessed by testing the transcription ability of various mutant constructs in MUC1-expressing and non-expressing cell lines. Binding of oligonucleotides covering the Sp1 sites to factors in nuclear extracts was analyzed with gel shift assays. The data indicate that while both Sp1 sites are functional in activating transcription in MUC1-expressing breast cancer cell lines, the proximal site can bind an additional factor, SpA, which competes with Sp1 for binding and negatively regulates transcription. While mutation of the proximal site to abolish SpA binding and retain Sp1 binding results in increased transcription in both expressing and non-expressing cells, the largest effect was seen in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, which shows the highest ratio of SpA:Sp1 binding in gel shift assays. The results suggest a role for SpA binding in determining the level of expression of MUC1 in epithelial cells, where a functional Sp1 site is required for expression. In contrast the poor expression of MUC1 in non-expressing cells is only partly corrected by abolition of SpA binding, and transcription repression in these cells appears to involve other elements, such as the E-box at −84/−72 (9Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Google Scholar; see also Fig. 10). In vitro binding assays revealed that the distal Sp1 site behaves as a classical Sp1 sequence since the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide competed out all the bands formed with the −582/−561 MUC1 oligonucleotide. In contrast, a more complex interaction of factors binding to the sequences between nucleotides −114/−89 was observed in both expressing and non-expressing cell lines. As in the case of the distal GC box, a predominant complex was formed by the Sp1 transcription factor. In addition a slightly faster migrating complex was detected, which could not be competed out by an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide or by polyclonal Sp1 antiserum, suggesting binding of a protein unrelated to Sp1. Using a set of mutant oligonucleotides we identified a novel binding motif AGGGGGCGGGG in the MUC1 promoter, able to bind both Sp1 and an additional factor (SpA). While the Sp1 core hexanucleotide motif, GGGCGG, was shown to be involved in binding of both factors, the 5′ terminal AG dinucleotide appeared to be crucial for binding of the SpA factor but not for Sp1. This explains the failure of Sp1 “consensus” sequence oligonucleotide (flanked by TC at the 5′ end) to bind the SpA factor. The factor binding to the SpA motif in the MUC1 promoter is distinct from other members of Sp1 family (Sp3, Sp4) that have been identified so far, since these factors have been shown to bind the Sp1 “consensus” sequence (15Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4561Google Scholar, 16Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Google Scholar). However, binding of some of these factors to the site at −99/−90, in addition to the Sp1 or SpA, cannot be excluded, and they could be responsible for formation of complexes C3 and C4 (see Fig. 4). An inhibitory role for SpA in regulating transcription is suggested by the observation that conversion of the SpA motif into a site unable to bind the new factor, by mutagenesis of the 5′-AG dinucleotide, resulted in increased transcription of a CAT reporter gene in all cell lines tested. It is, however, not clear whether the factor binding to the SpA motif is a true repressor or whether it is just a weaker activator than Sp1. Attempts to clarify this issue by defining a sequence (by mutagenesis) that bound SpA but not Sp1 were unsuccessful, suggesting that, apart from the 5′ dinucleotide, which affected binding of SpA but not Sp1, the nucleotide sequence required for binding was the same for both factors. This might also serve as evidence for mutually exclusive binding of both factors to the site. An intriguing question arises as to what determines the sequence preferences of various GC box-binding proteins in vivo. Both Sp1 and SpA binding activity seem to be present in several different cell types, albeit at different levels. While it is possible that the balance between the levels of the factors contributes to the activity of the promoter, other factors may also play a role. The SpA element at −101/−90 is part of a 43-bp asymmetric DNA element in which a homopurine sequence at −133/−90 is interrupted by only 3 pyrimidine nucleotides (8Graham R.A. Stewart L.S. Peat N.P. Beverley P. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Tumor Targeting. 1995; 1: 211-221Google Scholar, 22Hollingsworth M.A. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C.D. Pahwa G.S. Maher III, L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1138-1146Google Scholar). A subsequence between −133/−102 termed M-PMR3 displays a mirror symmetry, is sensitive to single-strand specific probes, and single-stranded oligonucleotides form a specific complex with a 27-kDa protein (22Hollingsworth M.A. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C.D. Pahwa G.S. Maher III, L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1138-1146Google Scholar). We show here that the deletion of this region of mirror symmetry results in an increase in transcription of a reporter gene in all cell types tested, suggesting a negative function of the element. Band shift assays using a 65-bp oligonucleotide, including the 5′-asymmetric region (−150/−89), showed a remarkable change in the specificity of the SpA element. Using a shorter oligonucleotide, −107/−89, the Sp1 complex was the most abundant complex; the binding of the SpA factor being visible only in the presence of excess of cold consensus Sp1 competitor and with a high concentration of nuclear extracts. However, when the long oligonucleotide containing the M-PMR3 region was used the binding preference of the sequence at −101/−90 for the SpA was enhanced. We suggest that the profound strand asymmetry may account for the altered specificity of the site. Although the existence of single-stranded non-B DNA conformation in vivo has yet to be proved, the equilibrium between regular duplex and single-stranded conformations might be an interesting mechanism for regulating affinity of binding sites for common transcription factors. The effect on gene expression of the M1 mutation (AG → CT) in the 5′ sequence of the proximal Sp1 site shows that although this results in some increase in expression in non-epithelial cells, the increase is not sufficient to reach the level seen in the epithelial cell lines showing high expression of MUC1. However, the null mutation in the proximal Sp1 core sequence (M4) also results in increased expression in the non-expressing HT1080 cells (while inhibiting transcription in expressing cells). Moreover, previous data (9Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Google Scholar) suggest that a sequence more proximal to the transcriptional start site at −84/−72 (termed E-MUC1) may also be involved in tissue-specific regulation of expression since null mutations abolishing binding of factors to this sequence also show increased expression in non-epithelial cells, while reducing expression in epithelial cells. Since a double mutation in the proximal Sp1 and E-MUC1 sites resulted in a 12-fold increase in expression in non-epithelial cells, bringing the expression into the range seen in some epithelial cells, a synergistic interaction between the two sequences in controlling tissue-specific expression is indicated (9Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Google Scholar). In the double mutant, the distal Sp1 site must be acting with some other proximal element(s), possibly the GC box at −57/−44, to activate transcription in non-expressing cells. This element does not, however, appear to be used in expressing cells (9Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Google Scholar). An interesting possibility is that the proximal Sp1 site, which can bind the SpA factor, is in fact involved in the increased expression of the MUC1 gene seen in breast and other carcinomas. This suggestion is supported by the observation that the increase in transcription resulting from the mutation in the Sp1 site leading to loss of SpA binding is highest in MCF-7 cells, which also appear to have the highest relative ratio between SpA and Sp1 binding activity. In many respects MCF-7 cells represent the most differentiated of the breast cancer cell lines showing low transcription of MUC1 (9Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Google Scholar), polarity and apical expression of the mucin, 2A. Rughetti, unpublished observation. and a relatively normal glycosylation pattern of the MUC1 gene product (23Brockhausen I. Yang J. Burchell J. Whitehouse C. Taylor-Papadimitriou J.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 607-617Google Scholar), and as such could be closer in phenotype to the normal epithelial cells. Clearly a more detailed analysis of the expression and function of SpA in normal and malignant breast epithelial cells is warranted. We are grateful to Dr. Malcolm Parker and Dr. Clive Dickson for their critical reading of the manuscript and to Ian Goldsmith for help in supplying the oligonucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2112324969,"Repetitive transient increases in cytosolic calcium concentration (calcium spikes or calcium oscillations) are a common mode of signal transduction in receptor-mediated cell activation. Repetitive calcium spikes are initiated by phospholipase C-mediated production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and are thought to be generated by a positive feedback mechanism in which calcium potentiates its own release, a negative feedback mechanism by which calcium release is terminated, and a slow recovery process that defines the time interval between calcium spikes. The molecular mechanisms that terminate each calcium spike and define the spike frequency are not yet known. Here we show, in intact rat basophilic leukemia cells, that calcium responses induced by InsP3 are diminished for a period of 30-60 s following an InsP3-induced calcium spike. The sensitivity of calcium release for InsP3 was probed by UV laser-mediated photorelease of InsP3, and calcium responses were monitored by fluorescence calcium imaging. A maximal loss in sensitivity (desensitization) was observed for InsP3 increases that resulted in a near maximal calcium spike and was expressed as an 80-100% reduction in the calcium response to an equal amount of InsP3, released 10 s after the first UV pulse. When the amount of released InsP3 in the second pulse was increased 2-3-fold, desensitization was overcome and a second calcium response of equal amplitude to the first was produced. A power dependence of 3.2 was measured between the amount of released InsP3 and the amplitude of the triggered calcium response, explaining how a small decrease in InsP3 sensitivity can lead to a nearly complete reduction in the calcium response. Desensitization was abolished by the addition of the calcium buffers BAPTA and EGTA and could be induced by microinjection of calcium, suggesting that it is a calcium-dependent process. Half-maximal desensitization was observed at a free calcium concentration of 290 nM and increased with a power of 3.7 with peak calcium concentration. These studies suggest that reversible desensitization of InsP3-induced calcium release serves as a “saw-tooth” parameter that controls the termination of each spike and the frequency of calcium spikes.

https://openalex.org/W2114517650,"The Escherichia coli aspartate receptor Tar is involved in the thermotactic response. We have studied how its thermosensing function is affected by the modification of the four methyl-accepting residues (Gln295, Glu302, Gln309, and Glu491), which play essential roles in adaptation. We found that the primary translational product of tar mediates a chemoresponse, but not a thermoresponse, and that Tar comes to function as a thermoreceptor, once Gln295 or Gln309 is deamidated. This is the first identification of a thermosensing-specific mutant form, suggesting that the methylation sites of Tar constitute at least a part of the region required for thermoreception, signaling, or both. We have also investigated the inverted thermoresponse mediated by Tar in the presence of aspartate. We found that, whereas the deamidated-and-unmethylated form functions as a warm receptor, eliciting a smooth-swimming signal upon increase of temperature, the heavily methylated form functions as a cold receptor, eliciting a smooth-swimming signal upon decrease of temperature. Thus, it is suggested that Tar exists in at least three distinct states, each of which allows it to function as a warm, cold, or null thermoreceptor, depending on the modification patterns of its methylation sites.

INTRODUCTIONTemperature is one of the crucial environmental parameters that restrict growth and other biological activities in any organism. Therefore, virtually all organisms show some kind of response to an increase or decrease in temperature. It is, however, generally very difficult to investigate how an organism senses temperature shifts, since most higher organisms have no specialized thermosensing organ, and temperature affects a wide variety of cell functions. Thermotaxis in Escherichia coli, however, has been well characterized in terms of physiology, genetics, and biochemistry (1Imae Y. Eisenbach M. Balaban M. Sensing and Response in Microorganisms. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1985: 73Google Scholar). Thermal stimuli are sensed by the four closely related transmembrane receptors (2Maeda K. Imae Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They are reversibly methylated at four or five glutamate residues within their C-terminal cytoplasmic domains (14Springer M.S. Goy M.F. Adler J. Nature. 1979; 280: 279-284Google Scholar, 15Kehry M.R. Dahlquist F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10378-10386Google Scholar, 16Terwilliger T.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7719-7725Google Scholar). Methylation and demethylation are the basis of adaptation in chemo/thermotaxis and are catalyzed by CheR and CheB, respectively (17Springer W.R. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 533-537Google Scholar, 18Stock J.B. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3659-3663Google Scholar). An attractant stimulus, whether chemical or thermal, causes elevated methylation of the receptors, which shuts off the attractant signal output. In contrast, a repellent stimulus brings about lowered levels of methylation to counteract the repellent signal (15Kehry M.R. Dahlquist F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10378-10386Google Scholar). Increases and decreases in methylation levels correspond to the magnitudes of attractant and repellent stimuli, respectively. It should be noted that some of the methyl-accepting glutamate residues are derived from glutamine residues in the primary translational products (19Kehry M.R. Bond M.W. Hunkapiller M.W. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3599-3603Google Scholar, 20Sherris D. Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6051-6055Google Scholar). CheB is also responsible for the specific and irreversible deamidation of these groups.Extensive genetic and biochemical studies on bacterial chemotaxis have identified all of the protein components involved in the chemotactic signal transduction pathway from the detection of attractants and repellents to the control of swimming behavior (for review, see 10Bourret R.B. Borkovich K.A. Simon M.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 401-441Google Scholar, 11Stock J.B. Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys.

In brief, when a chemoreceptor binds to a repellent, it activates the cytoplasmic autophosphorylating protein kinase CheA that can transfer phosphate group to the cytoplasmic signaling protein CheY and the receptor methylesterase CheB. Phospho-CheY interacts with switch component(s) of the flagellar motor to cause its clockwise rotation; phospho-CheB demethylates chemoreceptor molecules to shut off the tumbling signal. On the other hand, binding of an attractant to a receptor causes inhibition of CheA kinase, which results in a decrease in CheY and CheB phosphorylation. The same signaling pathway (from the receptor to the flagellar motor) is utilized in thermotaxis, but the mechanism underlying thermosensing has not been elucidated.Each receptor forms a ternary complex with CheA and the coupling protein CheW (21Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Google Scholar). Since the complex is stable in vitro (21Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Google Scholar, 22Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1993; 365: 343-347Google Scholar) and in vivo (23Maddock J. Shapiro L. Science. 1993; 259: 1717-1723Google Scholar), receptor-mediated control of CheA activity is thought to occur through structural changes within this receptor-CheW-CheA complex. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the thermosensing mechanism involves similar structural changes in the ternary complex to those caused by increases and decreases in temperature. It should be stressed that temperature dependence of autophosphorylation, phosphotransfer, or dephosphorylation cannot simply explain thermotaxis. Rather, the receptors seem to be primary thermosensors (2Maeda K. Imae Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 91-95Google Scholar, 3Mizuno T. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 360-367Google Scholar, 4Lee L. Mizuno T. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4769-4774Google Scholar, 5Lee L. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 377-382Google Scholar, 6Nara T. Lee L. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1120-1124Google Scholar): they fall into two classes, namely warm receptors (Tsr, Tar, and Trg) and cold receptors (Tar in the presence of attractants (see below) and Tap). A warm receptor produces attractant and repellent signals upon increases and decreases in temperature, respectively, whereas a cold receptor mediates the opposite responses to the same stimuli (6Nara T. Lee L. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1120-1124Google Scholar).Interestingly, two lines of evidence suggest that covalent modification of the methyl-accepting sites might influence the thermosensing properties of the receptors. First, cheB-defective strains, which can respond to but cannot adapt to chemotactic stimuli, show no thermoresponse, whereas cheR-defective strains, which cannot adapt either, retain thermosensing abilities (2Maeda K. Imae Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 91-95Google Scholar, 24Imae Y. Mizuno T. Maeda K. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 368-374Google Scholar). The absence of a thermoresponse in cheB mutants might be due to the absence of deamidation and/or demethylation of the receptors. Alternatively, CheB might be involved in the thermosensing/signaling process: e.g. it might constitute a thermosensor complex with the receptor, CheW and CheA. Second, Tar produces inverted thermotactic signals in the presence of any of its specific attractants, such as aspartate and maltose (3Mizuno T. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 360-367Google Scholar, 5Lee L. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 377-382Google Scholar). Whereas it usually functions as a warm receptor, Tar appears to be converted into a cold receptor after adapting to an attractant. Enhanced methylation of Tar has been proposed to cause this attractant-dependent conversion of thermoreceptor function.In this study, we have studied the roles of the methyl-accepting residues (Gln295, Glu302, Gln309, and Glu491: the set of the four residues will be referred to as [QEQE] throughout this paper) in the thermosensing function of Tar, by examining thermosensing profiles in the various genetic background.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that the primary translational product of tar (Tar with [QEQE]) does not have thermosensing ability (Fig. 1), but acquires it by the deamidation of either Gln295 or Gln309 (Table I). The multifunctional nature of bacterial chemoreceptors has been exploited to isolate mutants defective only in the response for a specific chemoeffector, leading to the identification of the amino acid residues responsible for its recognition (for Tar and Tsr, see 5Lee L. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 377-382Google Scholar and 35Hedblom M.L. Adler J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 1048-1060Google Scholar, 36Kossmann M. Wolff C. Manson M.D. J.

This is the first identification of a thermosensing-specific mutant form of the receptor, since it has been reported for Tar (35Hedblom M.L. Adler J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 1048-1060Google Scholar, 42Dunten P. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1491-1496Google Scholar) and Tsr (43Lin L.-N. Li J. Brandts J.F. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6564-6570Google Scholar) that covalent modifications of a receptor do not severely affect its ligand binding affinity.One interpretation of the results presented here is that the methylation sites of Tar constitute at least a part of the region required for the recognition of temperature or thermotactic signal production. In this regard, it would be interesting to test whether a cytoplasmic fragment of Tar can mediate thermoresponse at all, since some cytoplasmic fragments of Tar and Tsr have been shown to retain abilities to produce chemotactic signals (44Oosawa K. Mutoh N. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2521-2526Google Scholar, 45Ames P. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6340-6348Google Scholar).We have also shown that the unmethylated ([EEEE]) and the heavily methylated ([EmEmEmEm]) forms of Tar function as a warm receptor and a cold receptor, respectively. The unmethylated form of Tar mediated a normal thermoresponse in the presence of glycerol (Fig. 2). However, under no conditions tested, did it show any characteristics of a cold receptor in the cheB cheR background. In contrast, the heavily methylated form (i.e. the genetically deamidated Tar expressed in the cheB background) mediated an inverted thermoresponse in the presence of aspartate (Fig. 4). Under no conditions tested did it show any characteristics of a warm receptor. Thus, the specific methylation, and possibly the presence of aspartate or any of the other Tar-mediated attractants also, are required for the conversion of Tar from a warm to a cold receptor.In summary, covalent modification of the four methyl-accepting residues of Tar modulates thermosensing properties of the receptor. These findings reinforce the notion that thermotaxis is resulted from a temperature-dependent shift in an equilibrium between the two signaling states (corresponding to smooth swimming and tumbling) of the receptor itself. Further investigation of the effects of covalent modification would provide an important clue to elucidate what kind of structural change of the receptor plays an essential role in thermosensing.

https://openalex.org/W2003625850,"It has been reported that protein kinase C (PKC) interacts at multiple sites in β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. Nevertheless, there is still controversy concerning the importance of this enzyme in glucose-induced insulin release. The present study was undertaken to clarify whether glucose, directly, or through changes in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, could promote translocation of PKC from the soluble to the membrane compartment. Whereas glucose, which increases [Ca2+]i, did not affect long-term distribution of PKC activity between soluble and membrane fractions, this distribution was reversibly affected acutely by the Ca2+ concentration in the extraction media. Translocation of PKC to the membrane by incubation of HIT cells for 10 min in the presence of 20 nM phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) resulted in a 5-fold increase in glucose-induced insulin release. This was prevented by 50 nM concentration of the PKC inhibitor staurosporine, provided that the cells were exposed to the inhibitor before the phorbol ester. Cells pretreated with TPA demonstrated increased insulin secretion in response to glucose for several hours. This time course extended beyond the disappearance of [3H]TPA from the cells, which was complete after 1 h. Activation of PKC increased both average insulin release and the amplitude of oscillations 2-fold, but did not affect oscillation frequency. The stimulatory effect of increased PKC activity on insulin release was not matched by changes in [Ca2+]i. We suggest that stimulation of the pancreatic β-cell with glucose promotes transient translocation of certain PKC isoforms from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane as a direct consequence of the increase in [Ca2+]i. Such a translocation may promote phosphorylation of one or several proteins involved in the regulation of the β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. This results in potentiation of glucose-induced activation of insulin exocytosis, an effect then not mediated by an increase in [Ca2+]i per se. Hence, pulsatile insulin release can be obtained under conditions where overall [Ca2+]i does not change, challenging the view that oscillations in [Ca2+]i are indeed driving the oscillations in hormone release.

The β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling is regulated by a sophisticated interplay among fuel secretagogues, hormones, and neurotransmitters (1Efendić S. Kindmark H. Berggren P.-O. J. Int. Med. 1993; 229: 9-22Google Scholar, 2Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Rorsman P. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5448-5454Google Scholar).

Some hormones and neurotransmitters modulate the β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling by interacting with receptors linked through a GTP-binding protein to the phospholipase C system. When this system is activated, there is a hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, which results in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG) (1Efendić S.

Interestingly, DAG may also be formed from α-glycerophosphate derived from glucose metabolism as well as by phospholipase D- and/or phospholipase A2-induced breakdown of phosphatidylcholine (3Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar, 4Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Google Scholar). Hence, in the β-cell there is more than one way whereby DAG can be formed, which permits activation of PKC by various stimuli to play a central modulatory role in the molecular mechanisms regulating insulin release. Nevertheless, the role of PKC in glucose-induced insulin release is still a matter of controversy (5Metz S. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 3-7Google Scholar, 6Wollheim C.B. Dunne M.J. Peter-Riesch B.

Arguments favoring a role for PKC in glucose-induced insulin secretion include the observations that glucose causes translocation of PKC to the β-cell plasma membrane (7Ganesan S. Calle R.

It cannot be excluded that part of the controversy concerning a possible role for PKC in glucose-induced insulin release is an illusion, partly related to not only the fact that the enzyme can be activated by DAG originating from different sources, but also that it has multiple functions in the stimulus-secretion coupling, each of which may be difficult to pinpoint. In addition, numerous PKC isoforms are present in the β-cell (8Ganesan S. Calle R. Zawalich K. Smallwood J.I. Zawalich W.S. Rasmussen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9893-9897Google Scholar, 10Arkhammar P. Juntti-Berggren L. Larsson O. Welsh M. Nånberg E. Sjöholm Å. Köhler M. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 9712-9716Google Scholar), with the dominant classical Ca2+, DAG-sensitive isoform being α-PKC. This isoform of classic PKC translocates to membranes upon an increase in [Ca2+]i (3Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar). It is clear that PKC operates in the pancreatic β-cell affecting the molecular mechanisms regulating both [Ca2+]i and exocytosis of insulin. The aim of the present study was to resolve the controversy whether glucose stimulation of insulin-secreting cells involved translocation of α-PKC from the cytosolic to the plasma membrane compartment and the extent to which such an effect was related to changes in [Ca2+]i and/or activation of the insulin secretory machinery. Clonal insulin-secreting tumor cells HIT-T15 were cultured in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium supplemented with 50 microunits/ml penicillin, 50 microunits/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% EDTA. Cells were used between passages 64 and 85. HIT cells grown in 12-well culture plates (Nunc) were washed three times with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing (in mM) 109 NaCl, 4.6 KCl, 5 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.15 Na2HPO4, 0.4 KH2PO4, 0.1 MgSO4, and 20 HEPES, pH 7.4, and preincubated in identical buffer for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing either 0 or 10 mM glucose for 30 min before taking samples for insulin secretion measurements. HIT cells were also harvested and sandwiched between two layers of cytodex-3 microcarrier beads (Sigma) in a column of 1 cm in diameter and with the height of 1.3 cm. The cells were perifused at a rate of 0.3 ml/min with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer. Cells were exposed to TPA for 5 min at the end of the preincubation period, to translocate PKC to the plasma membrane. Thereafter, the dynamics of glucose-induced insulin secretion were investigated and compared to that from control cells, where PKC had not been translocated to the plasma membrane with phorbol ester. Insulin was monitored by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research Inc., St. Louis, MO) in fractions of perifusion medium, which were collected at 0.5-min intervals. The effect of glucose on insulin release from HIT cells that were allowed to recover from treatment with TPA, DiC8 and DiC8 plus okadaic acid for various periods of time was also investigated. In this case, cells in culture were incubated for 10 min with 20 nM TPA, 30 min with 100 µM DiC8 or 100 µM DiC8 plus 1 µM okadaic in RPMI 1640 medium, washed once in the same RPMI 1640 medium without additions, and then incubated in similar medium until their ability to secrete insulin was studied. HIT cells were incubated for 10 min in multiwell plates in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with [3H]TPA (0.1 µCi/ml) (DuPont NEN) and 20 nM cold TPA. Following incubation, TPA was removed and cells were rinsed and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium without phorbol ester. Cells were extracted in Krebs buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 after various intervals, to determine amounts of associated TPA. Samples of medium were also collected prior to extraction of cells. 3H was determined in a Beckman scintillation counter. Cells were loaded with 2 µM fura-2/AM, in a HEPES-buffered Krebs medium (23Longo E.A. Tornheim K. Deeney J.T. Varnum B.A. Tillotson T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9314-9319Google Scholar) containing no glucose, for 20-30 min at 37°C. Fluorescence signals of suspensions of HIT cells were recorded using a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer, equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a temperature-statted cell holder. Wavelengths used were 340/380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission. For single cell measurements of [Ca2+]i in a microscopic system, HIT cells were grown on glass coverslips and loaded with fura-2, as described above. Thereafter, the coverslips were mounted in an open chamber which was placed onto the stage of a Zeiss IM-35 fluorescence microscope. After obtaining baseline recordings, the cells were stimulated with 10 mM glucose while [Ca2+]i was monitored continuously, using a time-sharing fluorometer with output to a video camera (IONOPTIX Corp., Boston, MA). [Ca2+]i was estimated by performing a pixel by pixel ratio between images, where background was subtracted, using IONOPTIX software. HIT cells were incubated in Petri dishes in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 30-60 min. Thereafter, they were harvested and incubated, while shaking, for an additional 10 min in similar buffer. Aliquots of cells were then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, quickly pelleted, and placed on ice. In some cases, cells were stimulated with 10 mM glucose, for 5-10 min, prior to being aliquoted. Incubation media were aspirated and replaced with 200 µl of cold Ca2+/EGTA buffers (World Precision Instruments) ranging from 0.01 to 3.2 µM free Ca2+ supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 µg/ml leupeptin, and 0.35%β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were disrupted by sonication at 4°C. Cell homogenates were then centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 35 min in a Beckman model airfuge. The supernatant was taken as the cytosolic fraction while the pellet was resuspended in the same Ca2+/EGTA buffer as the first extraction with the addition of 0.2% Triton X-100. The pellet was then vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. This supernatant was taken as the pellet fraction. Triton X-100 was left out of the resuspension buffer in those experiments in which the pellet was washed. PKC activity was determined as the difference between histone phosphorylation in the presence and absence of phosphatidylserine (20 µg/ml), DAG (2 µg/ml), and Ca2+ (0.6 mM). Cytosol and pellet fractions, prepared as described above, were diluted 1:15 in EGTA extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 µg of leupeptin, and 0.35%β-mercaptoethanol. 1-2 µg of protein (12.5 µl) were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 125 µl of 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.16 mg/ml histone (Type III S), 50 µM ATP (1-2 µCi of [γ-32]ATP/assay tube) (24Majumdar S. Rossi M.W. Fujiki T. Philips W.A. Disa S. Queen C.F. Johnston Jr., R.B. Rosen O.M. Corkey B.E. Korchak H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9285-9294Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by spotting the reaction medium onto filter paper and washing with 1 liter of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mM pyrophosphate. Filters were dried and counted without scintillant in a Beckman model scintillation counter. PKC mass was determined by subjecting the protein sample to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), followed by transfer to nitrocellulose filter (Hoeffer). The nitrocellulose filter was incubated with an α-PKC-specific polyclonal rat antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.), followed by an anti-rat monoclonal rabbit antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham), as described by Towbin (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Protein bands were detected using an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham). Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test for unpaired data. Upon incubation of HIT cells in modified Krebs-Ringer buffer, containing 0 or 10 mM glucose, for 10 min followed by extraction in buffer containing either 0.01 or 3.2 µM free Ca2+, glucose did not affect sustained distribution of PKC activity between cytosolic and membrane fractions, as determined by incorporation of [32P]ATP into histone (Fig. 1). However, it was of interest to note that this distribution was affected by the actual Ca2+ concentration in the extraction media (Fig. 1), suggesting that the extraction process could mask rapidly reversible changes that had occurred in the cell. The total PKC activity was not changed by glucose or the concentration of Ca2+ in the extraction media. To establish a possible effect of Ca2+ on PKC translocation, HIT cells were extracted in different Ca2+/EGTA buffers and separated into cytosolic and membrane fractions, and relative distribution of enzyme activity was determined. Cells disrupted in extraction buffers containing increasing concentrations of free Ca2+ (0.01, 0.32, and 3.2 µM, respectively) exhibited increased PKC activity in their membrane fractions (Fig. 2A). Cytosolic PKC activity in these extracts decreased concomitantly. Western blot analysis using an anti-α-PKC specific antibody showed that the change in total PKC activity was accompanied by a qualitatively similar change in the distribution of the mass of the α-PKC isoform (Fig. 2B). The translocation of PKC, resulting from increased free Ca2+ concentrations in the extraction media, was readily reversible, as clearly shown in experiments where membrane fractions from the high Ca2+ buffer (3.2 µM, Fig. 3A) were washed in buffer with a low Ca2+ concentration (0.01 µM). Under these experimental conditions, PKC activity dissociated from the membrane fraction (Fig. 3B). When washing was performed in buffer containing a high Ca2+ concentration, PKC activity remained in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3D). These results are consistent with the idea that glucose, by raising [Ca2+]i, can indirectly affect distribution of PKC activity in the β-cell. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that the Ca2+ concentration in the extraction buffer is likely to artificially change this distribution.Fig. 3PKC activity reversibly binds to HIT cell membrane fractions in the presence of high Ca2+.

The PKC inhibitor staurosporine, at a concentration of 50 nM, prevented TPA from enhancing glucose-induced insulin secretion, provided that the cells were exposed to the PKC inhibitor prior to stimulation with TPA. These results document a strong synergism between glucose and PKC activation and suggest that PKC may phosphorylate a substrate that remains phosphorylated for a prolonged period of time and is not inhibited by staurosporine. Thus, only brief activation of PKC allows for enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the phorbol ester somehow induces a conformational change of PKC so that it can no longer be inhibited by staurosporine (27Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17160-17165Google Scholar). 4-α-Phorbol, a nonactive phorbol ester, had no effect on insulin release (data not shown). In order to further characterize the molecular mechanism whereby the putative PKC substrate potentiates glucose-induced insulin release, a time course of recovery from stimulus treatment was performed. HIT cells were pretreated with 20 nM TPA for 10 min or 100 µM concentration of the metabolically active DiC8 for 30 min and allowed to recover for various periods of time before testing the ability of the cells to secrete insulin in response to 10 mM glucose (Fig. 5). Cells that had been pretreated with TPA demonstrated an increased insulin secretion in response to glucose for a prolonged (several hours) period of time (Fig. 5A). A second addition of TPA, after recovery of normal glucose-induced insulin secretion, also resulted in enhanced hormone release in response to the sugar (data not shown), demonstrating that the recovery could not simply be explained by an overall loss of glucose responsiveness. A shorter time course of recovery of enhanced insulin secretion was obtained when DiC8 was used to stimulate hormone release (Fig. 5B). In this case, cells exhibited normal glucose-induced insulin release within 30 min of removal of DiC8. Interestingly, exposure of the cells to 1 µM phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, prior to the addition of DiC8 (data not shown), extended the recovery phase of normal glucose-induced insulin release to at least 1 h. It is noteworthy that the time course of recovery of glucose-induced insulin release after stimulation with TPA did not correlate with the disappearance of [3H]TPA from the cells (Fig. 5C). [3H]TPA was redistributed from the cells to the media within 1 h after removal of the phorbol ester from the incubation buffer. Although the residual activity was close to background, TPA may still be bound to PKC and thereby maintain phosphorylation and activation of the substrate. The discrepancy in effects between TPA and the readily metabolizable DiC8, are in line with previous findings demonstrating that DAG and TPA bind with different affinities and at different sites as well as inducing distinct activated conformational forms of PKC (27Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17160-17165Google Scholar). Hence, both the TPA data and the data demonstrating that the effect of DiC8 was prolonged by pretreatment with okadaic acid may be viewed in support of the notion that PKC phosphorylates a substrate that maintains a long lasting function in the β-cell and hence can be responsible for the prolonged stimulatory effect of glucose on insulin release. Next, we were interested in clarifying whether the long-lasting stimulatory effect on insulin release, subsequent to exposure of the cells for 5 min to 20 nM TPA, affected glucose-induced (10 mM) pulsatility in insulin release from column-perifused HIT cells. Whereas frequency of oscillations was unaffected, both average insulin release and amplitude of oscillations were increased by 2-fold (Fig. 6). Since PKC is a well-known potentiator of glucose-induced insulin release, increases in insulin release were expected. More interestingly, the frequency of oscillations was not affected by PKC. Although the molecular mechanisms that directly regulate pulsatility in insulin release remain to be established, we have reasons to believe that enzymes in the glycolytic pathway play essential roles (28Nilsson T. Schultz V. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 91-94Google Scholar). Hence, if this is true, our results suggest that these enzymes do not serve as direct substrates for PKC-induced phosphorylation in the pancreatic β-cell. It is of interest to note that the stimulatory effect of increased PKC activity on glucose-induced insulin release in HIT cells was not associated with further increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 7). On the contrary, the net increase in [Ca2+]i subsequent to K+-stimulation as measured in suspensions of HIT cells in a cuvette in a spectrofluorometer (Fig. 7A) was significantly less in those cells that were exposed to TPA. Moreover, the increase in [Ca2+]i normally obtained subsequent to activation of the PLC system, in the present study 0.2 µM bombesin was used as an agonist, was also suppressed in the presence of the phorbol ester (Fig. 7B). In this case, there was a decrease even in basal [Ca2+]i. When [Ca2+]i was measured in single cells in a microscope-based imaging system (Fig. 7C), there was no potentiation of the glucose-induced oscillatory pattern subsequent to the addition of TPA. On the contrary, if anything, the phorbol ester seemed to suppress the oscillations in [Ca2+]i, which is in marked contrast to the effects obtained in the insulin release experiments where TPA dramatically increased the amplitude of the oscillations (cf. Fig. 6). These findings indeed support the notion (22Zaitsev S.V. Efendić S. Arkhammar P. Bertorello A.M. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9712-9716Google Scholar, 29Berggren P.-O. Larsson O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 12-18Google Scholar) that there is not always a direct coupling between overall changes in [Ca2+]i and insulin release. Over the years a number of studies have been performed to clarify the role of PKC in the insulin secretory process. For this purpose, different approaches have been taken, such as direct activation of PKC by low concentrations (10 nM) of the phorbol ester TPA or down-regulation of the enzyme by prolonged treatment with high concentrations of TPA (200 nM) (19Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Welsh M. Welsh N. Berggren P.-O. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 207-215Google Scholar, 30Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Google Scholar). These effects of the phorbol ester reflect interaction with the classic PKC and certain novel PKC isoforms (3Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Google Scholar) and indicate that such isoforms can have important modulatory effects on the insulin secretory process. In the normal pancreatic β-cell, activation of PKC with TPA enhances glucose-induced insulin release without further increasing [Ca2+]i (19Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Welsh M. Welsh N. Berggren P.-O. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 207-215Google Scholar, 22Zaitsev S.V. Efendić S. Arkhammar P. Bertorello A.M. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9712-9716Google Scholar). The dissociation between increases in [Ca2+]i and insulin exocytosis in response to PKC activation has been further substantiated by experiments demonstrating a PKC-mediated increase in insulin release under conditions where there was no change in [Ca2+]i when both parameters were measured simultaneously in a perifusion system (22Zaitsev S.V. Efendić S. Arkhammar P. Bertorello A.M. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9712-9716Google Scholar). The present study clearly shows that translocation of α-PKC from the cytosol to the plasma membrane is not dependent on glucose per se, but rather on an elevation in [Ca2+]i, which is in accordance with a permissive role for Ca2+ in the stimulatory effect of the kinase on exocytosis of insulin. The transient nature of Ca2+-mediated translocation would explain previous, apparently contradictory, observations of PKC translocation using in situ histochemical techniques (7Ganesan S. Calle R. Zawalich K. Greenawalt K. Zawalich W.S. Shulman G.I. Rasmussen H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 313-324Google Scholar, 8Ganesan S. Calle R. Zawalich K. Smallwood J.I. Zawalich W.S. Rasmussen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9893-9897Google Scholar), on the one hand, and failure to document enhanced glucose-stimulated PKC association with the membrane fraction following cell fractionation (12Easom R.A. Hughes J.H. Landt M. Wolf B.A. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 164: 27-33Google Scholar, 18Howell S.L. Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 114-116Google Scholar), on the other hand. The fact that this translocation of PKC was so strictly dependent on Ca2+, and reversible upon withdrawal of the ion, may suggest that the activity of the enzyme oscillates in parallel with oscillations in [Ca2+]i. If so, this might represent a component in the molecular regulation of the pulsatility in insulin release. A similar dependence for Ca2+, with regard to subcellular distribution of PKC, has been demonstrated in human neutrophils (31Phillips W.A. Fujiki T. Rossi M.W. Korchak H.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8361-8365Google Scholar). In that study, the authors suggested that the distribution of PKC between cytosol and membrane is a dynamic equilibrium controlled by levels of free Ca2+. The extent to which translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane implies that the enzyme has to be present in the membrane throughout the stimulatory event is not clear. Alternatively, the possibility that it is sufficient that PKC induces phosphorylation of one or several proteins that remain phosphorylated during exocytosis and are then responsible for promoting transport, targeting, and fusion of insulin secretory granules with the plasma membrane must be considered. The results obtained with the phorbol ester TPA in the present study do not clearly differentiate between these two possibilities. The fact that TPA only needed to be present for a short period of time prior to glucose stimulation, in order to potentiate not only insulin release but also its oscillatory pattern, suggests phosphorylation of some regulatory proteins that are then responsible for mediating this potentiation and supports the second possibility. Interestingly, the stimulatory effect of the phorbol ester on glucose-induced insulin release remained for at least 3 h, indicating that the phosphorylated proteins stay phosphorylated and hence active for a prolonged period of time. However, although removal of TPA from the plasma membrane seemed to be complete after 1 h, we cannot exclude the possibility that some TPA remained bound to PKC and thereby maintained phosphorylation and activation of the substrate. Speaking against this possibility are the results by Szallasi et al. (32Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27159-27162Google Scholar), showing that cellular dissociation of phorbol ester leads to rapid redistribution to the cytosol of α-PKC in mouse keratinocytes. Measurement of glucose-induced insulin release from cells that were pre-exposed to the short-chain PKC activator DiC8 or DiC8 plus the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, may suggest that PKC indeed induced phosphorylation of one or several regulatory proteins that maintain a brief stimulatory effect on insulin exocytosis. The fact that cells pre-exposed to DiC8 recovered with regard to potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release after 30 min and that this recovery was delayed in the presence of okadaic acid, speaks in favor of dephosphorylation of actual PKC substrates being responsible for the rather rapid loss in potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release subsequent to stimulation with DiC8. The different response pattern obtained with TPA and DiC8 may reflect distinct interactions of these compounds with PKC (27Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17160-17165Google Scholar). Physiological DAG activators of PKC have chain lengths of 16 to 20 carbons, are considerably more lipophilic than DiC8, and would be expected to be associated with membranes for a longer period of time. The finding that PKC activation suppressed K+-induced increases in [Ca2+]i in HIT cells is likely to reflect pronounced activation of the Ca2+-outward transport system (33Berggren P.-O. Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 416-421Google Scholar). Hence, regulation of [Ca2+]i is a complex function of multiple Ca2+ carriers such that outward transport of Ca2+, at least partly promoted by a Ca2+-ATPase, is highly effective in restoring [Ca2+]i in insulin-secreting cells under conditions when PKC is activated. Although activation of PKC with TPA suppresses the activity of the PLC system and thereby the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, as has been reported earlier (10Arkhammar P. Juntti-Berggren L. Larsson O. Welsh M. Nånberg E. Sjöholm Å. Köhler M. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2743-2749Google Scholar) and which was also verified in the present study using bombesin as an agonist, the kinase does not interfere with either intracellular buffering of [Ca2+]i or the ability of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to release Ca2+ from internal stores (19Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Welsh M. Welsh N. Berggren P.-O. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 207-215Google Scholar). Activation of PKC did not enhance oscillations in [Ca2+]i in HIT cells. Moreover, we have previously shown that activation of the kinase on the contrary suppresses [Ca2+]i oscillations in normal β-cells (34Kindmark H. Köhler M. Efendić S. Rorsman P. Larsson O. Berggren P.-O. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 85-90Google Scholar). When discussing a possible role for PKC in the β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling, it should be borne in mind that this kinase constitutes a family of enzymes that may have diverse functions, distinct intracellular localization as well as varying cell-specific expression, and sensitivity to PKC activators. It is noteworthy that the HIT cells used in the present study have a number of features, with regard to effects of PKC activation, that are similar to those previously reported in normal β-cells and clonal insulin-producing RINm5F cells, thus making them an appropriate model to define the sites of action of PKC in the complex chain of events constituting β-cell signal transduction. The underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the potentiating effect of PKC on the oscillatory pattern in insulin release is at the moment not clear. Obviously, the present study does not support a major role for changes in [Ca2+]i in this context, but on the contrary reinforces the notion (22Zaitsev S.V. Efendić S. Arkhammar P. Bertorello A.M. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9712-9716Google Scholar, 29Berggren P.-O. Larsson O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 12-18Google Scholar) that there indeed exist a number of situations where there is a clear dissociation between changes in [Ca2+]i and regulation of insulin exocytosis. The fact that only the amplitude, but not the frequency, of the oscillations was affected suggests that the effect of PKC reflects recruitment of cells or synchronization of the secretory activity in a large number of cells in the insulin release column perifusion system, thereby enhancing an already existing oscillatory pattern in hormone release. The extent to which such a synchronization involves a more efficient cell to cell coupling through gap junctional proteins within clusters of HIT cells and/or release of a synchronizer molecule merits further investigation. A direct effect of PKC on the oscillator, by whatever mechanism, should have affected the frequency of the oscillatory pattern in insulin release. However, a more simple explanation for the effect of PKC on insulin release is that the kinase potentiates an existing oscillatory secretory activity in the individual cells by, for example, effective phosphorylation of one or several proteins directly regulating exocytosis in general and known to exist in the pancreatic β-cell (35Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Berggren P.-O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-12491Google Scholar)."

TRs belong to a large superfamily of structurally related transcription factors that include receptors for steroids, vitamin D, and retinoids (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar, 2Lazar M.A. Chin W.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Ribeiro R.C. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). TRs bind to specific DNA elements and regulate transcription by binding to TH, commonly 3,5,3′-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). The intracellular concentration of free T3 determines the rate and degree of TR occupancy and, consequently, the extent of TH-regulated transcriptional responses (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar, 2Lazar M.A. Chin W.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Ribeiro R.C.

Moreover, few studies have addressed outward TH transport (19Rao G.S. Rao M.L. Thilmann A. Quednau H.D. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Docter R.

Various cells overexpressing mdr-related proteins have been shown to exhibit accelerated export of dexamethasone, corticosterone, and aldosterone, as well as attenuation of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (23Ueda K.

In addition, selective outward transport of dexamethasone by an ABC protein was shown to modulate the biological potency of this steroid in yeast (28Kralli A. Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4701-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, there is no prior evidence that mdr-related proteins transport TH and no direct evidence that hormone transport regulates the actions of nuclear-acting hormones in mammalian cells.We have investigated whether hormone transport can regulate hormone action in mammalian cells using poorly differentiated HTC rat hepatoma cells specially adapted for resistance to a permeable bile acid ester (HTC-R cells) (29Brown Jr., R.S. Lomri N. De Voss J. Rahmaoui C.M. Xie M.H. Hua T. Lidofsky S.D. Scharschmidt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HTC-R cells exhibit enhanced capability to export bile acids and overexpress several plasma membrane proteins representing apparently novel members of the ABC/mdr family (29Brown Jr., R.S. Lomri N. De Voss J. Rahmaoui C.M. Xie M.H. Hua T. Lidofsky S.D. Scharschmidt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we report that HTC-R cells show resistance to TH that can be explained by reduced cellular TH concentration due to enhanced TH efflux. Because verapamil, a known inhibitor of mdr/P-glycoprotein function (30Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar), inhibits TH efflux and reverses TH resistance, we suggest that mdr/P-glycoproteins mediate TH resistance in these cells.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe first assessed responsiveness to TH by co-transfecting both HTC parental (HTC cells) and HTC-R cells with cDNAs encoding the human TRβ1 (hTRβ1) as well as a reporter gene encoding a TH responsive element upstream of CAT coding sequences. In the absence of co-transfected TRs, CAT production in HTC parental cells was not stimulated by T3 (10−7M) indicating the absence or very low content of endogenous TRs in these cells. HTC-R cells required approximately 10-fold higher T3 concentration than HTC parental cells for half-maximal induction of relative CAT activity (EC50 2.2 ± 0.4), range 0.5-3.8 nM, n = 7 for HTC cells compared to 17.9 ± 4.6, range 8.0-40.7 nM, n = 8 for HTC-R cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). The absolute CAT activity, however, did not differ between HTC and HTC-R cells. Moreover, in contrast to TH, HTC-R and HTC parental cells exhibited equal sensitivity to estradiol (Fig. 1B), indicating selectivity in the HTC-R cells' hormone resistance.We then studied TH uptake to test whether the TH resistance of HTC-R cells is due to altered TH transport. Although initial uptake (to 5 min) of T3 by HTC-R cells was at least as rapid as for HTC cells (Fig. 2, inset), steady state T3 accumulation by HTC-R cells was significantly less (Fig. 2). The decreased T3 accumulation in conjunction with similar initial entry rates suggest enhanced TH efflux from the HTC-R cells.Fig. 2Uptake of T3 by resistant (HTC-R) and non-resistant parental (HTC) cells. Uptake was measured at 37°C in RPMI medium containing 0.01% newborn calf serum and 125I-T3 (1 nM). Uptake is depicted for the first 5 min (inset) as well as over 4 h (mean ± S.D. of triplicates of a representative experiment).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Efflux was therefore studied directly in cells pre-loaded with 125I-T3. T3 efflux curves were bi-exponential, showing a rapid initial component and a slower terminal component (Fig. 3A). T3 efflux could be described by a two-compartment model; a small rapidly exchanging compartment (postulated to represent plasma membrane binding) and a larger, more slowly exchanging compartment (postulated to be intracellular). In both cell types the slow compartment comprised at least 95% of total cellular T3. The difference in steady state T3 content between HTC and HTC-R cells was accounted for by the difference in fractional efflux rates from the larger, slow compartment (Table I). As shown in Fig. 3A and Table I, the fractional rate of T3 efflux was much greater from the HTC-R cells than from HTC cells at 37°C. In contrast to their differential handling of T3, no difference was observed between the cell types in the rate of efflux of 125I-estradiol (Fig. 3B), a finding in agreement with the similar sensitivity of both cell types to estradiol (Fig. 1B).Fig. 3Efflux of hormone from resistant (HTC-R) and non-resistant parental (HTC) cells. A, the efflux study of cells preincubated 125I-T3 (1 nM) was performed at 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min as shown. Verapamil (10−4M) was present both during the 3-h preincubation and the efflux periods. B, efflux study of HTC-R and HTC parental cells preincubated with 125I-estradiol (10−9M) according to the same protocol described for T3. The results of A and B are representative of at least three independent experiments and show the mean ± S.D. of triplicate plates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I.Rate constants for T3 efflux from HTC and HTC-R cells under various conditionsExperimental conditionT3 efflux rate constant (min−1)HTC cellsHTC-R cells37&°C control0.010 &&±&0.00270.034 &&±&0.0053ap &0.005&compared to parental HTC cell controls.&&4&°CbIncubation at 4&°C during efflux period only.0.0017&±&0.0010cp&<&0.005&compared to controls of the same cell type.0.0034&±&0.0006cp&<&0.005&compared to controls of the same cell type.37&°C&+&verapamil (100&µM)dVerapamil, excess T3 or excess T4 present in the indicated concentrations during preincubation and efflux periods.0.0080&±&0.00010.014 &&±&0.0055cp&<&0.005&compared to controls of the same cell type.37&°C&+&verapamil (10&µMdVerapamil, excess T3 or excess T4 present in the indicated concentrations during preincubation and efflux periods.Not tested0.027 &&±&0.0055ep <&0.01&compared to controls of the same cell type.37&°C&+&T3 (100&µM)dVerapamil, excess T3 or excess T4 present in the indicated concentrations during preincubation and efflux periods.0.011 &&±&0.00120.012 &&±&0.0059cp&<&0.005&compared to controls of the same cell type.37&°C&+&T4 (100&µM)dVerapamil, excess T3 or excess T4 present in the indicated concentrations during preincubation and efflux periods.0.0059&±&0.00320.0034&±&0.0027cp&<&0.005&compared to controls of the same cell type.a p &0.005&compared to parental HTC cell controls.b Incubation at 4&°C during efflux period only.c p&<&0.005&compared to controls of the same cell type.d Verapamil, excess T3 or excess T4 present in the indicated concentrations during preincubation and efflux periods.e p <&0.01&compared to controls of the same cell type. Open table in a new tab Analysis by chromatography of cells and media from 1 to 24-h incubations revealed progressive accumulation of metabolic products (mainly iodide) in the incubation media. However, T3 comprised more than 93% of radiolabel associated with both HTC and HTC-R cells as well as the radiolabel in the efflux media from these cells. Therefore, the difference in T3 content and in efflux cannot be ascribed to altered T3 metabolism.To characterize further the mechanism of enhanced T3 efflux by HTC-R cells, we studied the effects of excess TH, cold incubation, and verapamil. Preincubation with excess T3 or T4 in concentrations (10−4M) sufficient to produce a 30,000-70,000-fold increase in cell-associated hormone inhibited efflux of radiolabeled T3 in HTC-R cells, suggesting that the efflux mechanism in these cells is saturable. Excess T4 was at least as effective an inhibitor of T3 efflux as was excess T3, suggesting that both hormones share the same transporter (Table I). T3 efflux was also markedly slowed at 4°C (Table I, Fig. 3A). Verapamil had no significant effect on T3 efflux from HTC cells, but produced concentration-dependent inhibition of T3 efflux from the HTC-R cells (Table I). Fig. 3A shows that verapamil (10−4M) slowed TH extrusion in HTC-R cells, such that the percent T3 remaining in these cells at 60 min increased from 11.2 ± 2 to 34.2 ± 10% (p < 0.01), approaching values found in HTC cells (50.9 ± 11 and 56.6 ± 6% in the absence and in the presence of verapamil, respectively). These findings are also consistent with the presence in both cell types of a basal hormone efflux which is nonsaturable and verapamil-insensitive. Moreover, the presence of verapamil during a 3-h incubation with 125I-T3 (1 nM) increased total T3 content of HTC-R cells by a factor of 1.9 (p < 0.01; one-way analysis of variance and the Student-Neuman-Keul test) over that in HTC-R cells incubated without verapamil. In contrast, the drug had no significant effect on T3 content of HTC parental cells. Chromatographic analysis of cells and efflux media showed that verapamil, present during preincubation and efflux periods, did not affect T3 metabolism in either HTC or HTC-R cells. These data are consistent with enhanced T3 efflux as the major determinant of the lower T3 content in HTC-R cells.To test whether a verapamil-sensitive TH extrusion process plays a role in the observed TH resistance of HTC-R cells, we measured the functional response to T3 in both cell lines in the presence and absence of verapamil (10−4M). As shown in Fig. 4, there was a significant verapamil-induced shift in CAT activity toward greater T3 sensitivity in HTC-R cells (EC50 12.7 ± 4.4 nM with PBS compared to 5.4 ± 1.8 nM with verapamil; n = 4, p < 0.04; Student's paired t test) but not in HTC cells (EC50 1.9 ± 0.5 nM with PBS compared to 1.5 ± 0.4 nM with verapamil; n = 3, NS; Student's paired t test). The lack of an inhibitory effect of verapamil on estradiol efflux (not shown) or on T3 efflux from HTC cells (Table I) and the verapamil-induced reversal of TH resistance in HTC-R cells (Fig. 4) indicate that these verapamil-induced changes are not attributable to toxicity or other nonspecific effects.Fig. 4Response of resistant HTC-R (triangles) and parental HTC (circles) cells to T3 in the absence (PBS, open symbols) and presence of verapamil 10−4M (closed symbols) under the same conditions described in the legend to Fig. 1. Data are expressed as percent of maximal activity of fold activation (ratio of CAT activity of T3-treated cells to that of ethanol-treated controls). Fold activation of CAT activity was similar in the absence and presence of verapamil in both HTC and HTC-R cells. These results are representative of four (HTC-R) and three (HTC) independent experiments and show the mean of triplicate plates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, these findings suggest that (i) HTC-R cells exhibit a TH efflux mechanism which is greatly enhanced relative to HTC cells, (ii) T3 efflux from HTC-R cells is saturable and sensitive to verapamil, and (iii) decreased T3 content and resistance to T3 in HTC-R cells are due to enhanced T3 efflux.To obtain a preliminary indication of the potential physiological relevance of these observations we examined the effect of verapamil on TH extrusion mechanism by primary rat hepatocytes, cardiac atriocytes, ventriculocytes, and fibroblasts in primary culture. As shown in Fig. 5A, the rate of T3 efflux from rat hepatocytes was significantly inhibited by verapamil (10−4M). Verapamil also increased the total cellular and nuclear content of T3 of hepatocytes by 1.5- and 1.7-fold (p < 0.01), respectively (not shown). T3 efflux was inhibited by verapamil (10−4M) also in rat ventriculocytes, atriocytes, and fibroblasts (Fig. 5B and not shown), suggesting that TH extrusion mechanisms observed in HTC-R cells may occur in many mammalian tissues.Fig. 5Efflux of T3 from hepatocytes (panel A) and cardiac ventriculocytes (panel B). Rat hepatocytes and rat cardiac ventriculocytes were isolated as described previously and efflux of T3 was measured with and without verapamil (10−4M). These results are representative of at least three independent experiments and show the mean ± S.D. of triplicate plates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The accompanying paper (43Kralli A.

Altered hormone transport represents one potential explanation for hormone resistance syndromes that occur in the absence of receptor mutations (40Arai K. Chrousos G.P. Steroids. 1995; 60: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and for heterogeneity of response in different tissues in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and TH resistance (41Beck-Peccoz P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17152-17156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggest that active hormone efflux constitutes a novel mechanism for physiologic regulation of the action of TH and potentially other hormones that act through the nuclear hormone receptor gene superfamily. INTRODUCTIONThyroid hormones (THs) 1The abbreviations used are: THthyroid hormoneTRthyroid hormone receptorT33,5,3′-triiodo-L-thyronineABCATP-binding cassettemdrmultidrug-resistantHTCrat hepatoma cellstkthymidine kinaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePBSphosphate-buffered saline. regulate growth, differentiation, and other critical functions in a variety of cell types by acting through nuclear receptors (TRs). TRs belong to a large superfamily of structurally related transcription factors that include receptors for steroids, vitamin D, and retinoids (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar, 2Lazar M.A. Chin W.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Ribeiro R.C. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). TRs bind to specific DNA elements and regulate transcription by binding to TH, commonly 3,5,3′-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). The intracellular concentration of free T3 determines the rate and degree of TR occupancy and, consequently, the extent of TH-regulated transcriptional responses (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar, 2Lazar M.A. Chin W.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Ribeiro R.C. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).The role of cellular transport in modulating intracellular hormone concentration is poorly understood. Several studies of cellular TH accumulation have demonstrated saturable, stereospecific, energy-requiring TH uptake (4Rao G.S. Eckel J. Rao M.L. Breuer H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Moreover, few studies have addressed outward TH transport (19Rao G.S. Rao M.L. Thilmann A. Quednau H.D. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Docter R.

Various cells overexpressing mdr-related proteins have been shown to exhibit accelerated export of dexamethasone, corticosterone, and aldosterone, as well as attenuation of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (23Ueda K.

Gruol D.J. Newby R.F. Rajah F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, selective outward transport of dexamethasone by an ABC protein was shown to modulate the biological potency of this steroid in yeast (28Kralli A. Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4701-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, there is no prior evidence that mdr-related proteins transport TH and no direct evidence that hormone transport regulates the actions of nuclear-acting hormones in mammalian cells.We have investigated whether hormone transport can regulate hormone action in mammalian cells using poorly differentiated HTC rat hepatoma cells specially adapted for resistance to a permeable bile acid ester (HTC-R cells) (29Brown Jr., R.S. Lomri N. De Voss J. Rahmaoui C.M. Xie M.H. Hua T. Lidofsky S.D. Scharschmidt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HTC-R cells exhibit enhanced capability to export bile acids and overexpress several plasma membrane proteins representing apparently novel members of the ABC/mdr family (29Brown Jr., R.S. Lomri N. De Voss J. Rahmaoui C.M. Xie M.H. Hua T. Lidofsky S.D. Scharschmidt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we report that HTC-R cells show resistance to TH that can be explained by reduced cellular TH concentration due to enhanced TH efflux. Because verapamil, a known inhibitor of mdr/P-glycoprotein function (30Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar), inhibits TH efflux and reverses TH resistance, we suggest that mdr/P-glycoproteins mediate TH resistance in these cells.

AML1 is suggested to perform a pivotal role in myeloid cell differentiation, whereas it can cause neoplastic transformation when overexpressed in fibroblasts. In this study, we demonstrated that the reducing reagent, dithiothreitol (DTT), markedly enhances the DNA binding of AML1 expressed in COS7 cells. Oxidation by diamide or modification by N-ethylmaleimide of the free sulfhydryl residues inhibited the interaction of AML1 with DNA. The diamide effect was reversible with excess of DTT, whereas DTT could not restore the DNA binding of AML1 treated with N-ethylmaleimide. Site-directed mutagenesis of the amino acid residue 72, a highly conserved cysteine in the runt homology domain of AML1, to serine almost completely abolished DNA binding without altering the interaction with PEBP2β/CBFβ. This substitution also impaired transactivation through the consensus DNA sequence and transformation of fibroblasts induced by AML1b.

The only subunit of this enzyme functionally examined to date, yeast Sec11p, is related to signal peptidase I from bacteria. Since bacterial signal peptidase is capable of processing both prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal sequences as a monomer, it is unclear why the analogous enzyme in the ER contains proteins unrelated to signal peptidase I. To address this issue, the gene encoding Spc1p, the yeast homologue to mammalian SPC12, is isolated from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Spc1p co-purifies and genetically interacts with Sec11p, but unlike Sec11p, Spc1p is not required for cell growth or the proteolytic processing of tested proteins in yeast. This indicates that only a subset of the ER signal peptidase subunits is required for signal peptidase and protein degradation activities in vivo. Through both genetic and biochemical criteria, Spc1p appears, however, to be important for efficient signal peptidase activity.

Through both genetic and biochemical criteria, Spc1p appears, however, to be important for efficient signal peptidase activity. In eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, secretory signal sequences (signal peptides) function in the transport of polypeptide chains through membranes separating the extracytoplasmic space from the cytosolic milieu (reviewed in 1von Heijne G. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1Google Scholar). While not all signal peptides are proteolytically processed upon transport across the membrane, cleavable signals consist of a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids usually preceded by one or more positively charged amino acids and followed by the signal peptidase cleavage site. Signals exhibiting this motif are ubiquitous in nature as demonstrated by their presence in polypeptide chains targeted to and across membranes of bacteria and membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCPYcarboxypeptidase Yαfα-factorkbkilobase pair(s). mitochondria, and chloroplasts of eukaryotes. Furthermore, signal sequences of precursor proteins in bacteria and eukaryotic cells may be exchanged and then recognized and cleaved correctly by the signal peptidase of the other cell type both in vitro and in vivo. endoplasmic reticulum polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis carboxypeptidase Y α-factor kilobase pair(s). One of the earliest studied enzymes capable of precisely cleaving signal peptides off of newly synthesized precursors, signal peptidase I, resides within the inner cell membrane of the bacterium Escherichia coli (2Zwizinski C. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7973-7977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also referred to as leader peptidase I, this enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain and therefore contains all of the amino acids essential for catalyzing the signal peptide cleavage reaction. This enzyme contains three distinct regions, including an essential serine residue, common to members of the signal peptidase I family (3Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional members of this family include Sec11p of the ER signal peptidase complex in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and two distinct subunits in both the ER signal peptidase from mammals and the mitochondrial inner membrane protease from yeast. The requirement for two signal peptidase I homologues in the mammalian ER signal peptidase is unclear; however, it has been shown that different sets of precursor proteins are cleaved by different subunits of the mitochondrial inner membrane protease (5Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A similar theme is demonstrated by E. coli which contains signal peptidase II cleaving a different set of precursors from that recognized by signal peptidase I (6Innis M.A. Tokunaga M. Williams M.E. Loranger J.M. Chang S.-Y. Chang S. Wu H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4308-4312Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Yu F. Yamada H. Daishima K. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Signal peptidase isolated from the ER membrane is more complicated than other proteins in the signal peptidase I family in that it contains several polypeptide chains that are unrelated to signal peptidase I. There is some controversy, however, as to the number of polypeptide chains present in ER signal peptidase. The enzyme purified from canine pancreas contains five membrane-bound proteins with the following molecular masses: 25, 22/23 (a glycoprotein), 21, 18, and 12 kDa (8Evans E.A. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The analogous complex in yeast seems to consist of four proteins with molecular masses ranging from 13 to 25 kDa (9YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a two-subunit complex isolated from hen oviduct is sufficient to perform the signal peptide cleavage reaction in vitro (10Baker R.K. Lively M.O. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8561-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, canine SPC21 (mammalian signal peptidase complex protein with molecular mass of 21 kDa) and SPC18 are highly similar to Sec11p of the yeast signal peptidase complex (11Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Greenburg G. Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol.

Strong similarity also exists between Sec11p and one of the proteins in the two-subunit avian signal peptidase (14Lively M.O. Shelness G.S. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 59Google Scholar). The remaining protein of this two-subunit complex is homologous to mammalian SPC22/23 (15Newsome A. McLean J.W. Lively M.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). SPC22/23, SPC25 and SPC12 are dissimilar to each other and to proteins of the signal peptidase I family (16Greenburg G. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25354-25358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kalies K.-U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4325-4329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Shelness G.S. Kanwar Y.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17063-17070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These five canine subunits fall into two topologically distinct groups: single-spanning proteins exhibiting a type II orientation (the C terminus localizes to the luminal side of the membrane), and proteins containing two membrane-spanning segments oriented with their N and C termini facing the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Proteins in the first group, represented by SPC18, SPC21, and SPC22/23, possess relatively large C-terminal domains (19Shelness G.S. Lin L. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5201-5208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SPC12 and SPC25, which fall into the second topological group, contain large cytoplasmic domains and very short luminal stretches of amino acids (17Kalies K.-U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4325-4329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The fact that the catalytic site of signal peptidase is probably localized to the luminal side of the ER membrane suggests that SPC12 and SPC25 may not perform a direct role in enzyme activity (17Kalies K.-U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4325-4329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Yeast Sec11p is the only subunit of the ER signal peptidase that has been examined in vivo. Mutations affecting Sec11p prevent cell growth and the cleavage of tested precursor proteins (11Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17143-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These findings and the above-described protein sequence homologies suggest that Sec11p contains the catalytic site. Furthermore, the Sec11p-type protein appears to be important for the degradation of at least some abnormal membrane proteins within the ER of yeast (20Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17143-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and mammals (21Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To extend the in vivo analysis of the subunits of ER signal peptidase, we have cloned the yeast homologue to SPC12. Our data show that the homologue, termed Spc1p, is nonessential for signal peptidase and protein degradation activities but is important for efficient signal peptidase activity. Media, cell growth conditions, immunological procedures, and pulse-chase methods have been described elsewhere (20Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol.

A high copy (2µ) plasmid library marked with LEU2 (American Type Culture Collection ATCC no. 37323) was introduced into temperature-sensitive yeast strain CMYD1 (sec11) at 23°C, and 5,500 transformants were replicated onto agar plates at 32°C. The plasmid pSPC1 was obtained from a transformant that grew at 32°C and 35°C. A 0.5-kb SpeI restriction fragment from pSPC1 was subcloned into high copy plasmid pRS426 (2 µ, URA3) (24Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar) and low copy plasmid pRS316 (CEN URA3) (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the 0.5-kb SpeI fragment was determined using a Sequenase kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The plasmid used for disruption of SPC1 was constructed as follows. The 2.3-kb EcoRI fragment from pSPC1 was inserted into vector pUC19 (26Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11381) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was digested with SpeI, which removes the entire SPC1 coding region. A 0.8-kb NheI fragment containing the TRP1 gene was inserted into this SpeI site. The NheI fragment was obtained from a modified YDp-W plasmid (27Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.-A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) that contains TRP1 flanked by two NheI sites (a NheI linker was inserted at the SmaI site of the plasmid YDp-W). To verify construction of the Δspc1 mutation, genomic DNA was isolated from yeast cells according to previously described methods (28Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

For Southern analysis, genomic DNA was digested with SpeI, subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Corp.) and UV cross-linked (0.3 J/cm2) to the membrane. The SPC1 probe was amplified by PCR using pSPC1 as a template. The amplification reaction mixture contained α-35S-dATP (1,500 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN) at a molar ratio of 50:1 (radiolabeled:unlabeled). The forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers were 5′-GCTACGAACGATAGTGTT and 5′-CGCGGATCCTAGAGATAGCGATGGT, respectively. The radiolabeled probe was then hybridized to the membrane as described previously (29Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7247) Google Scholar). To construct the plasmid pHF314, the SPC1 gene was amplified by a PCR reaction using a forward oligonucleotide bearing a BamHI site followed by the start codon of SPC1 (5′-CGCGGATCCAATGTCTGAGATATTA) and the above-described reverse oligonucleotide primer which corresponded to a sequence located 120 nucleotides downstream of SPC1. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII (the HindIII site is located 60 nucleotides downstream of the SPC1 stop codon) and inserted into the BamHI and HindIII sites of vector pRS315 (CEN, LEU2) (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 0.7-kb BamHI fragment bearing the Gal1/Gal10 divergent promoter (30Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1442-1448Crossref Scopus (631) Google Scholar) was inserted into the above-described BamHI site immediately upstream of SPC1. This BamHI promotor fragment was obtained from a derivatized form of pBM272 (obtained from Dr. Mark Johnston, Washington University, St. Louis) that was constructed by inserting a BamHI linker into the blunt-ended HindIII site of pBM272. To construct a frameshift mutation in SPC1, plasmid pRS426 carrying a 0.5-kb SpeI fragment bearing SPC1 was digested with NcoI, which cleaves within the SPC1 gene. The protruding 5′ ends were then filled in by using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. The blunt-ended DNA was religated, thus creating a frameshift. Membranes from strain RSY521 were prepared and extracted as described elsewhere (31Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) with the modification that saponin was deleted from the first membrane extraction. Digitonin extract corresponding to 100 eq was supplemented with CaCl2 and MnCl2 (1 mM each) and was incubated overnight with 7 ml of Concanavalin A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 4°C. After washing with D buffer containing 420 mM potassium acetate, the salt concentration was diminished by a wash with D buffer alone. Bound proteins were eluted at room temperature with D buffer containing 1 Mα-methylmannoside for at least 4 h. The glycoproteins were then applied to 5 ml of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia) and signal peptidase was recovered from the flow-through of the column. This fraction was subjected to further purification using a 1-ml cartridge of SP-Sepharose HiLoad (Pharmacia). Elution was carried out at 4°C with a 42-ml linear salt gradient ranging from 0 to 500 mM potassium acetate. Signal peptidase was eluted with about 200 mM salt. The fractions of the SP-Sepharose chromatography were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Proteins corresponding to 8 eq of yeast membranes were applied per lane. Partial amino acid sequences of the two lowest protein bands were then obtained by sequencing of either the N terminus (Sec11p) or of fragments obtained after digestion with Lys-C (Spc1p). We used a high copy suppressor approach (32Esnault Y. Blondel M.-O. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Kepes F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4283-4293Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Kurihara T. Silver P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to search for genes encoding proteins of the ER signal peptidase complex (see “Experimental Procedures”). This search yielded the high copy (2µ) plasmid pSPC1 that contained a suppressor, termed SPC1, of the sec11 mutation. The growth pattern of sec11 mutant strain CMYD1 bearing and not bearing pSPC1 is shown in Fig. 1 (genotypes of relevant strains are listed under “Experimental Procedures”). Through subcloning of DNA fragments derived from pSPC1 into a high copy (2µ) plasmid, a 500-base pair SpeI restriction fragment was found to confer growth to sec11 mutant strain CMYD1 at 35°C (plasmid constructions are described under “Experimental Procedures”). A low copy (CEN) plasmid containing the SpeI fragment did not correct the growth defect of strain CMYD1 at 35°C, indicating the suppressor's effect on the sec11 mutant was dependent on its overexpression in cells. DNA sequencing of this 500-base pair SpeI fragment revealed the presence of an open reading frame containing 94 codons and no other open reading frame containing AUG followed by more than 40 codons. A frameshift mutation was constructed at codon 72 of the 94 codon open reading frame, and the mutated construct was introduced into a high copy plasmid. Strain CMYD1 transformed with this mutated construct failed to grow at 35°C, demonstrating that the 94 codon open reading frame corresponded to sec11 suppressor SPC1 (GenBank™ 2The nucleotide sequence of SPC1 has been submitted to GenBank™, and, independently, the nucleotide sequence of the region of chromosome 10 containing SPC1 has been entered into the data base through the effort of the yeast genome sequencing project (accession nos. Z49511, Z49510, and X87611). ). The calculated molecular mass of high copy suppressor protein Spc1p was 10.8 kDa, a size that was similar to the SPC12 subunit of the mammalian signal peptidase complex. Using the analysis of Kyte and Doolittle (34Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16673) Google Scholar), Spc1p and SPC12 contained two closely spaced stretches of hydrophobic amino acids, both of which were of sufficient length to span the membrane (amino acids contained within putative transmembrane segments are enclosed by a box in Fig. 2). The predicted isoelectric point of Spc1p was 9.3, in good agreement with SPC12 (pI = 9.4). Sequence comparisons were performed by aligning the putative transmembrane segments of Spc1p and SPC12, with the remainder of the amino acids aligned accordingly. From this comparison, the sequence identity was 17%, and the similarity was 50% (Fig. 2). Alternatively, an analysis that introduced gaps in the sequences of Spc1p and SPC12 (35Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9286) Google Scholar) gave an identity value of 24%, with the overall similarity equal to 63%. Taken together, these data indicated that Spc1p was a homologue of mammalian SPC12. Signal peptidase was partially purified from yeast cells to directly assess whether Spc1p was a signal peptidase subunit. A complex containing four prominent bands with apparent molecular masses of 12, 17, 18, and 25 kDa was identified (Fig. 3). These molecular masses were similar to sizes reported previously for subunits of partially purified signal peptidase from yeast (9YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As expected, the 17-kDa band corresponded to Sec11p as demonstrated by N-terminal sequencing which gave the sequence MNLRFE (11Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Internal peptide sequencing of the 12-kDa protein revealed distinct sequences that matched the predicted sequence of Spc1p (matched sequences are underlined in Fig. 2). These data thus indicate Spc1p is the lower of four prominent proteins in the ER signal peptidase isolated from yeast cells. Because Spc1p is a high copy growth suppressor (Fig. 1), we reasoned its overexpression may correct the sec11 defect as measured biochemically. To test this, strains CMYD1 (sec11) and CMYD1/pSPC1 were grown to log phase at 23°C, shifted to 35°C for 1 h; then signal peptidase activity was examined by pulse-chase (20Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17143-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using anti-Kar2p antibodies (36Rose M. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The data show that preKar2p, the precursor to ER resident protein Kar2p (36Rose M. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 37Normington K. Kohno K. Kozutsumi Y. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1223-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), was present in the sec11 mutant after the pulse (Fig. 4, lane 1), with a small amount of preKar2p conversion to mature Kar2p occurring during the chase (lane 2). This result is consistent with our previous observation that preKar2p is cleaved in the conditional sec11 mutant in a temperature-dependent manner (20Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17143-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Examination of the signal peptide cleavage reaction in sec11 mutant cells containing the SPC1 high copy expression plasmid (strain CMYD1 (sec11)/pSPC1) revealed no apparent processing of preKar2p during the pulse at 35°C (lane 3). However, a greater amount of preKar2p was converted to Kar2p during the chase in strain CMYD1 (sec11)/pSPC1 (lane 4) than in sec11 cells lacking pSPC1 (lane 2). Overexpression of SPC1 therefore increased the amount of preKar2p cleavage occurring in the sec11 mutant during a 30-min chase analysis. A plasmid construct was prepared containing a replacement of the entire SPC1 open reading frame with the TRP1 gene (Fig. 5A). This construct was linearized and introduced into diploid strain SEY6210.5 (Δtrp1). Transformed cells (Trp+) were sporulated and tetrads were dissected. This dissection revealed two Trp+ spores in each of ten tetrads. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed that the haploid spores phenotypically Trp+ contained a disruption of SPC1 (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, Southern blot analysis indicated SPC1 was present in only one copy in cells (Fig. 5C). From observing strain HFY401 (Δspc1) incubated on agar plates at various temperatures, it was apparent that the Δspc1 mutant grew normally at 18, 23, 30, and 37°C on minimal or rich media, indicating Spc1p is nonessential for cell viability. An in vivo pulse-labeling analysis (22Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) of preKar2p processing was employed to examine signal peptidase activity in the Δspc1 mutant. This analysis depicted in Fig. 6 shows that functional signal peptidase was present in wild-type strain HFY402 as measured by the presence of Kar2p after a 5-min pulse (lane 1). Control strain CMYD1 containing the temperature-sensitive sec11 mutation displayed preKar2p after a 5-min pulse at its nonpermissive temperature (37°C) (lane 2), while in Δspc1 mutant strain HFY401 preKar2p was converted to Kar2p in a manner similar to that observed in wild-type cells (compare lanes 1 and 3). These results thus show no measured defect in the processing of the preKar2p signal peptide in the Δspc1 mutant. We repeated the pulse-labeling analysis examining α-factor (αf), a secreted pheromone (38Kurjan J. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1982; 30: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a vacuolar protease (39Stevens T.B. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 443-448Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A 5-min pulse-labeling experiment (22Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) revealed that, while the control sec11 mutation inhibited the cleavage of the αf and CPY precursors, the Δspc1 mutation did not affect their processing (not shown). Moreover, since the active site of signal peptidase localizes to the ER lumen, the presence of cleaved forms of Kar2p, CPY, and αf demonstrate that the Δspc1 mutation does not strongly affect translocation pathways operating at the ER membrane in yeast cells (31Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 40Fang H. Green N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41Green N. Fang H. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 42Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1989; 67: 131-144Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although these data do not exclude the possibility that very small defects were present in the Δspc1 mutant or that signal peptides of proteins not examined were uncleaved, we conclude that Spc1p does not perform an essential role in the processing of tested precursor proteins, and, based on the absence of a measured growth defect, we further conclude that a sufficient level of processing of the precursors to essential proteins occurs in Δspc1 mutant cells. A diploid strain heterozygous for the Δspc1 and sec11 mutations was produced through a cross between strains CMYD1 (sec11) and HFY401 (Δspc1::TRP1). The heterozygote was allowed to sporulate, and tetrads were dissected. Interestingly, not all tetrads yielded four colonies at temperatures permissive for cells containing the sec11 mutation (23 and 18°C). Indeed, the tetratype (3 viable spores/1 Trp−ts, 1 Trp−, 1 Trp+):parental ditype (4 viable spores/2 Trp+, 2 Trp−ts):nonparental ditype (2 viable spores/2 Trp−) ratio of 7:5:8 was detected with tetrads incubated at 23°C. This pattern of viable and inviable progeny indicated the sec11 and Δspc1 mutations were synthetically lethal (i.e. the double mutant was unable to grow). In order to produce a viable sec11 Δspc1 double mutant for analysis of signal peptidase activity, we prepared a construct, pHF314, expressing SPC1 under control of the regulatable GAL1 promotor (see “Experimental Procedures”). pHF314 was introduced into the above-described diploid cells heterozygous for the Δspc1 and sec11 mutations. Transformants were sporulated, and random spores were placed on agar plates containing galactose. Out of 15 analyzed spores, 4 were identified that did not grow after shifting to medium containing glucose. These glucose-sensitive cells were temperature-sensitive for growth, demonstrating the presence of the sec11 mutation. PCR analysis, similar to that shown in Fig. 5B, confirmed that the glucose-sensitive cells contained a disruption of SPC1. A typical growth curve of the sec11 Δspc1 double mutant containing the regulatable SPC1 expression plasmid is shown in Fig. 7A. Strain CMY50 (sec11 Δspc1)/pHF314 was grown to early log-phase (A600 = 1.5); cells were then divided with one half of the cells suspended in a medium containing glucose and the other half remaining in the medium containing galactose. Through monitoring the optical densities of cultures in the respective growth media, it was apparent that, approximately 10 h after shifting to glucose, cell growth had begun to be inhibited. At this time point, an aliquot representing 3 A600 cell equivalents was removed from each flask, diluted to A600 = 1, then subjected to a pulse-chase analysis at 30°C, a condition that only partially inactivates signal peptidase in the sec11 mutant (20Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17143-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Data shown in Fig. 7B (lanes 1-3) demonstrate that cells utilizing galactose for growth (and thus phenotypically Spc1+) displayed partial processing of preKar2p. In contrast, cells grown in the presence of glucose to inactivate expression of plasmid-borne SPC1 displayed strong inhibition in the processing of preKar2p (lanes 4-6). This revealed a dependence for Spc1p in the sec11 mutant. The data presented thus far show that Spc1p is important for efficient signal peptidase activity as measured in sec11 mutant cells. If Spc1p does indeed function in facilitating enzyme activity, then it should be possible to demonstrate a role for Spc1p in cells wild-type for SEC11. To this end, we asked whether the signal peptidase enzyme lacking Spc1p could function efficiently in cells expressing precursor proteins and abnormal membrane protein AHDK2, a chimera containing a fragment of histidinol dehydrogenase tethered to the ER membrane through its attachment to a luminal domain of membrane protein arginine permease (20Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17143-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar). AHDK2 has been shown to be degraded with distinct proteolytic fragments produced in a Sec11p-dependent manner. The 2µ (high copy) expression plasmid pAHDK2 (20Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17143-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was introduced into strains HFY402 (wild-type) and HFY401 (Δspc1), then AHDK2 was visualized by pulse-chase using anti-histidinol dehydrogenase antibodies (22Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The data depicted in Fig. 8A show that AHDK2 was proteolyzed in wild-type cells (lanes 1 and 2) and in the Δspc1 mutant (lanes 3 and 4) with the concomitant production of f1, a proteolytic intermediate of AHDK2 degradation (20Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17143-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This demonstrates efficient processing of AHDK2 in the Δspc1 mutant even though AHDK2 was expressed from a high copy plasmid. The proteolysis of preKar2p in cells expressing high levels of AHDK2 was examined using a pulse-labeling analysis (22Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 8B show that preKar2p was converted to Kar2p in control strain HFY402/pAHDK2 (lane 1), indicating overexpression of AHDK2 did not strongly affect signal peptide cleavage by wild-type signal peptidase. In contrast, Kar2p and preKar2p were detected in strain HFY401 (Δspc1)/pAHDK2 (lane 2). We conclude from the presence of preKar2p in the Δspc1 mutant expressing AHDK2 (Fig. 8, lane 2) and from the absence of preKar2p in the Δspc1 mutant lacking AHDK2 (Fig. 6, lane 3) that Spc1p has a role in facilitating efficient signal peptidase activity in cells expressing abnormal membrane protein AHDK2. This degree of precursor accumulation in strain HFY401 (Δspc1)/pAHDK2 was insufficient, however, to produce an apparent growth defect. This study describes the first in vivo characterization of a signal peptidase subunit other than subunits from the bacterial signal peptidase I protein family. Spc1p, the yeast homologue of mammalian SPC12, co-purifies with Sec11p, an essential subunit of the yeast signal peptidase complex, and exhibits the following two genetic interactions with Sec11p. Overexpression of Spc1p suppresses the temperature-sensitive sec11 mutation, and the spc1 and sec11 mutations are synthetically lethal. Despite these genetic and physical interactions with an essential component of the signal peptidase complex, Spc1p is nonessential for the proteolytic cleavage of tested precursor proteins and the degradation of abnormal membrane protein AHDK2. Our results are therefore in good agreement with in vitro data obtained from analysis of enzymatically active avian signal peptidase which contains a Sec11p homologue but lacks a Spc1p homologue (10Baker R.K. Lively M.O. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8561-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results agree with topology studies (17Kalies K.-U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4325-4329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that mammalian SPC12 does not contribute amino acids to the catalytic site of signal peptidase. While Spc1p is probably not itself catalytic, we show that Spc1p is important for increasing the efficiency of signal peptidase action. Specifically, overexpression of Spc1p promotes cleavage of the preKar2p signal peptide in the temperature-sensitive sec11 mutant, and depletion of Spc1p exacerbates the sec11 defect. In addition, preKar2p accumulates in Δspc1 mutant cells expressing abnormal membrane protein AHDK2. The latter result argues that competition exists between preKar2p and AHDK2 for the active site of signal peptidase and supports the idea that abnormal membrane protein AHDK2 is degraded through a signal peptidase-dependent pathway. Since enzymatically active signal peptidase I purified from E. coli contains only one polypeptide, it was expected that Spc1p, which is unrelated to signal peptidase I, would be important for activities other than signal peptide cleavages. Instead, our data suggest that Spc1p is important for efficient signal peptidase activity. We thus conclude that either bacterial cells contain a homologue of Spc1p that does not bind tightly to signal peptidase I or eukaryotic cells have a particular requirement for noncatalytic subunits such as Spc1p. This requirement could derive from the fact that, in contrast to bacterial signal peptidase, ER signal peptidase must recognize signal peptides of proteins targeted to various compartments of the secretory pathway. Since signal peptides vary in length and primary sequence, the diversity of signal peptides recognized by the ER enzyme is probably greater than that encountered in bacteria. In addition to the demand placed on ER signal peptidase to efficiently process a variety of precursor proteins, the multisubunit signal peptidase complex is also involved in protein degradation. The observed accumulation of preKar2p in the Δspc1 mutant expressing abnormal membrane protein AHDK2 suggests that Spc1p may function to ensure efficient signal peptide cleavages in situations where the protein degradation activity within the ER is high.

Biologically unstable repeating CTG·CAG, CGG·CCG, and AAG·CTT triplet DNA sequences are involved in the etiology of several neurological diseases (reviewed in the accompanying paper (1Ohshima K.

To date, only these three types of repeating triplet sequences have been associated with human hereditary diseases; a total of 10 triplet repeats are possible.

Campbell, University of California at Los Angeles) (10Campbell D.A. van Bree M.P. Boothroyd J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2759-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was digested with SspI, and then the −1104 to −761 fragment (344 bp), which contained the TTA·TAA repeat and the neighboring (A + T)-rich sequences, was recloned into the HincII site of pUC19 to give pRW3143. pRW3148, pRW3146, and pRW3145 were constructed as described (19Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, pRW3143 was digested with SacI and HindIII, and regions corresponding to fragments with shorter TTA·TAA repeats (invisible by staining with ethidium bromide) were eluted from a 1.8% agarose gel. These components were recloned into the SacI-HindIII site of pUC19. All plasmid DNAs were isolated from Escherichia coli HB101 by the alkaline lysis method as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All DNA inserts were sequenced on both strands to determine the TTA·TAA repeat sizes of the plasmids. Three chemical probes, OsO4 (Aldrich), diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) (Aldrich), and chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) (Fluka), were used to modify the TTA·TAA repeat containing plasmids as described previously (21Hanvey J.C.

After the reactions, all samples were purified by gel filtration through Sephadex G-50 microcolumns equilibrated with H2O (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and precipitated with ethanol. Both strands of the modified plasmids were analyzed by primer extension (1Ohshima K. Kang S. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5449) Google Scholar). After chemical probing, the DNA was analyzed by the procedure described previously (1Ohshima K. Kang S. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16773-16783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Kang S. Ohshima K. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

The DNA was dissolved in 20 µl of a solution containing 0.2 M NaOH and 2 ng of 5′-32P-end-labeled primer. For primer extension analysis, two primers were used, namely M13/pUC forward sequencing primer 1211 (17-mer, New England Biolabs) and M13/pUC reverse sequencing primer 1201 (16-mer, New England Biolabs) for the bottom and top strands, respectively. The plasmid was heated for 90 s at 90°C followed by incubation for 4 min at room temperature. The DNA was neutralized with 0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and was precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was resuspended in 10 µl of a solution containing 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM 2′-deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and 5 units of a modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase Version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. After termination of the reaction by the addition of 95% formamide and 20 mM EDTA, the DNA was fractionated on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. The modified DNA was divided into two samples, digested with either SacI and HindIII or EcoRI and PstI, and labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the large fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). After isolation from a polyacrylamide gel, the DNA fragments were treated with 1 M piperidine for 30 min at 90°C, lyophilized, and applied to a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in parallel with sequencing markers generated by the chemical degradation method (24Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5449) Google Scholar). The bands were visualized by autoradiography. Topoisomers of plasmids were prepared as described previously (25Singleton C.K. Wells R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 122: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNAs with various supercoil densities were generated by incubating 6 µg of DNA in 100 µl of a solution containing 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 0-11 µM ethidium bromide, and chicken erythrocyte topoisomerase (26Germond J.E. Hirt B. Oudet P. Gross-Bellard M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1843-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) for 60 min at 37°C. The ethidium bromide and topoisomerase were removed by two phenol extractions followed by two ether extractions, and the pooled DNAs were resuspended in H2O after ethanol precipitation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (27Wang J.C. Peck L.J. Becherer K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 85-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mixtures of topoisomer populations prepared as described above were subjected to first-dimension gel electrophoresis in 1.25% agarose at 3.3 V/cm at 25°C in 0.5 × TBE buffer (pH 8.3) (0.5 × TBE, 45 mM Tris borate, 1 mM EDTA) or TAE buffer (pH 8.0) (TAE, 40 mM Tris acetate, 1 mM EDTA). The gel then was soaked in 0.5 × TBE buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.7-20 µM chloroquine diphosphate (Sigma) for 3 h. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was carried out at a 90° angle to the first dimension at 3.3 V/cm at 25°C in 0.5 × TBE buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.7-20 µM chloroquine diphosphate. Fig. 1 shows the cloned sequences in the recombinant plasmids and a list of the plasmids used in this study. Three plasmids with shorter TTA·TAA repeats were produced as described (19Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) from the original pRW3143, which contains (TTA·TAA)90. As expected, only a part of the perfect (TTA·TAA)90 repeat was deleted; inserts with 60, 30, and 18 repeats of TTA·TAA were produced. The plasmids were designated pRW3148, pRW3145, and pRW3146, respectively. To investigate the formation of unusual DNA (non-B DNA) structures, such as Z-DNA, triplexes, and cruciforms, chemical probes have been used (28Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 29Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, San Diego1994Google Scholar) because they can specifically modify bases in single-stranded or conformationally perturbed DNA or B-Z junctions. The modified base(s) can be detected by cleavage of the modified sites with a specific reagent (i.e. hot piperidine) or the primer extension assay which detects the inhibition of elongation by DNA polymerase. In this study, we used OsO4, DEPC, and CAA to evaluate the existence of non-B DNA structures in the TTA·TAA repeat sequences. OsO4 reacts at the C-5=C-6 double bond of pyrimidines (T ≫ C) in the presence of tertiary amines, such as pyridine and 2,2′-bipyridine, and is substantially more reactive to single-stranded DNA than to double-stranded DNA (21Hanvey J.C.

Cell. 1985; 42: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For inverted repeat sequences neighbored by (A + T)-rich sequences, OsO4 was used as a chemical probe to detect unpaired single-stranded DNA (32Lilley D.M.J. Palecek E.

Also, AT·AT repeat sequences were found to form cruciform structures by detection of single-stranded regions with OsO4 (40Greaves D.R. Patient R.K. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol.

DEPC carboxyethylates purines (A > G) at the N-7 position by the opening of the imidazole ring in single-stranded DNA as in triplexes (21Hanvey J.C. Klysik J. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

On the other hand, CAA as well as bromoacetaldehyde reacts at the N-1 and the C-6 amino groups of adenines or the N-3 and the C-4 amino groups of cytosines to generate 1,N6-ethenoadenine or 3,N4-ethenocytosine derivatives at unpaired adenines or cytosines (46Kayasuga-Mikado K.

Fig. 2 shows chemical reactivities with these three chemical probes (OsO4, DEPC, and CAA) on the bottom strand of pRW3146, which contains 18 repeats of TTA·TAA, as analyzed by the primer extension assay. By this analysis, the modified bases, thymines by OsO4 and adenines by DEPC or CAA, on the template strand were detected by the inhibition of elongation by the DNA polymerase (Sequenase) at the corresponding bases on the extended strand. Surprisingly, modifications were observed throughout the (TAA)18 sequence by all three chemical probes as a result of inhibition of elongation by Sequenase on the top strand (TTA strand) (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 3, and 5). The (A + T)-rich sequences, which are located on the 3′ side of (TTA)18 and contain (TTA)5 and (TTA)2, also were modified by DEPC and CAA (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 5) but not by OsO4 (Fig. 2, lane 1). We also determined that the modification pattern of bromoacetaldehyde was identical to that of CAA (data not shown). These observations may result from the fact that DEPC was reacted at 20°C for 30 min, a longer reaction time than with OsO4, and CAA was used at 37°C for 30 min, a higher temperature and a longer reaction time than with OsO4. On the other hand, on the bottom strand (TAA strand), modifications by OsO4, DEPC, and CAA gave the same pattern as those of the top strand (TTA strand) (data not shown), indicating the existence of unpaired regions in both strands of supercoiled pRW3146. We investigated the effect of the length of the TTA·TAA repeats. Fig. 3 shows the OsO4 modification patterns for different lengths of TTA·TAA repeat containing plasmids under the same conditions described above. From 18 up to 90 repeats of TTA·TAA, the modifications were evenly distributed throughout the TTA·TAA repeats on both strands (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7), indicating that unpaired regions exist in all of these lengths of TTA·TAA repeats. Recently, we observed that CTG·CAG repeat sequences derived from the myotonic dystrophy gene and CGG·CCG from the fragile X gene, even without chemical modification, caused pausings of DNA polymerases, namely Sequenase, the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, and human DNA polymerase β (13Kang S. Ohshima K. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27014-27021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This behavior was attributed to the formation of a new type of non-B conformation by this triplet repeat sequence. Parallel studies were performed on the TTA·TAA triplet repeats described herein. No pausing of Sequenase was found on both strands of all TTA·TAA inserted plasmids (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8), even with preincubation (at 37 or 50°C for 10 min) before primer extension, a condition which strongly enhanced the pausings for CTG·CAG repeat sequences (13Kang S. Ohshima K. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27014-27021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). No chemical probes were employed in this study. Also, there was no pausing with the Klenow fragment in the absence of chemical modifications, even under the preincubation conditions (data not shown). Hence, we conclude that TTA·TAA repeats do not adopt unusual DNA conformations that inhibit the progression of DNA polymerase, in contrast to the behavior with CTG·CAG and CGG·CCG repeats. The chemical probing described above revealed that TTA·TAA repeat sequences formed unpaired regions at the supercoil density of −0.06. Some unusual DNA structures (left-handed Z-DNA, cruciforms, triplexes) are known to be induced by negative superhelical density in recombinant plasmids (21Hanvey J.C. Klysik J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7386-7396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Accordingly, the effect of superhelical density on OsO4 modification on these TTA·TAA sequences was investigated. Fig. 4 shows the quantitation of the amount of OsO4 modification for pRW3146 as a function of average negative supercoil densities (−). At low supercoil density (≤0.025), few OsO4 modification sites were observed. In linearized pRW3146, no sites were observed by chemical degradation analyses (data not shown). As the torsional stress was increased, however, the degree of OsO4 modification increased. The reactivity relative to supercoiling shown in Fig. 4 is broad compared with the all-or-none transitions found for triplexes or cruciforms. 80% of the transition took place over 0.07 density units, whereas only ∼0.01 was required for the other conformational changes (35Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5950-5956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Collier D.A. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Thus, the gradual transition (Fig. 4) indicates that a larger duplex region is unpaired as more supercoil density is added to the system. Supercoil-dependent alternate structures of DNA, such as cruciforms, triplexes, and Z-DNA, have been detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (38Bowater R. Aboul-ela F. Lilley D.M.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11495-11506Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 39Bowater R.P. Aboul-ela F. Lilley D.M.J.

The chemical probe analyses described above suggested that unpaired DNA regions exist throughout the TTA·TAA repeat and in a part of the (A + T)-rich neighboring sequence, depending on the conditions employed. We used two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis to further investigate the unwound DNA regions revealed by the chemical probing results. The topoisomer populations of pUC19, pRW3146, and pRW3145 were analyzed as shown in Fig. 5. pRW3146 and pRW3145 exhibited an initial relaxation of 3.5 and 5 supercoil turns, respectively, at topoisomer numbers −10 and −11. This corresponded to relaxation of 37 and 53 bp at supercoil densities of −0.037 and −0.041, similar to the superhelical density at which the initiation of OsO4 modification occurred (Fig. 4 for pRW3146 and data not shown for pRW3145). The relaxation continued until topoisomer numbers −17 and −18 (superhelical density −0.061 and −0.063, respectively). The total relaxation for pRW3146 and pRW3145 was 10.5 and 12 supercoil turns corresponding to unpairing of 110 and 126 bp, respectively. These results indicate the relaxation of the entire region of the perfect TTA·TAA repeat (54 and 90 bp, respectively) and the neighboring (A + T)-rich 40-bp sequences. This observation was consistent with the results of the chemical probing in 0.5 × TBE buffer (pH 8.0) described below. No transition was observed for the control pUC19. The electrophoresis was repeated on the same samples in TAE buffer (pH 8.0). Interestingly, no transitions were observed. This result will be discussed in the next section. Similar studies were performed on pRW3143 which contains 90 repeats of TTA·TAA with 20 µM chloroquine in the second dimension. Whereas the resolution of the gel did not permit an accurate determination of the total number of topoisomers relaxed, at least 26 were detected indicating an unpairing of at least 270 bp. Temperature and salt concentration have been shown to affect the unpairing of (A + T)-rich sequences as well as AT·AT repeat sequences in a supercoiled molecule (37Furlong J.C. Sullivan K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2145415573,"We report the identification and biochemical characterization of an endogenous m5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) in the A2058 human melanoma cell line. This is the first demonstration of a m5AChR outside the central nervous system. The unusual effector coupling of this endogenous m5AChR is presented. The coding region amplified by polymerase chain reaction was identical to the known m5AChR sequence. Binding studies indicated a Kd of 99 ± 6 pM and a Bmax of 45 ± 4 fmol/mg membrane protein. This m5AChR coupled to stimulation of arachidonic acid release and to a 50% inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The inhibition of cAMP production was insensitive to pertussis toxin treatment, but was dependent upon extracellular calcium. In contrast to the odd mAChR pattern, no cAMP was produced in response to carbachol (CC) stimulation. Moreover, no release of inositol phosphates could be measured after CC treatment despite the presence of at least 2 phospholipase C isoforms in A2058 cells. CC-stimulated arachidonic acid release (EC50 = 17.8 ± 0.1 µM) was dependent upon external Ca2+, with marked reduction after coincubation with EGTA, Co2+, or high doses of verapamil (IC50 = 166 µM) or diltiazem (IC50 = 243 µM). Brief exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate augmented CC-stimulated arachidonic acid release, whereas prolonged phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment resulted in down-regulation of release. Activation of the m5AChR resulted in Ca2+ influx that was attenuated by muscarinic antagonism and removal of extracellular Ca2+. A2058 cells exposed to CC had no alteration of cell shape or growth potential in monolayer culture, however, a statistically significant reduction in density-independent growth was observed over the range of CC concentrations from 0.1 to 100 µM. This endogenous m5AChR has a novel signal transduction coupling profile and receptor activation reduces clonogenic potential.

Its distribution is predominantly in neural tissue or highly innervated smooth muscle-containing tissues. The odd-numbered receptors (m1, m3, and m5) have similar biochemical characteristics consisting of agonist-mediated generation of inositol polyphosphates, release of arachidonic acid, influx and internal release of calcium, tyrosine kinase activation, and production of cAMP (7Challis R.A.

All other mAChR receptor subtypes are found in the brain as well as other systemic sites. The m2 receptor is abundant in heart muscle and is found in smooth muscles, such as the small and large intestine, trachea, bladder, and uterus (1Bonner T.I.

In contrast, the odd-numbered receptors are not found in heart, and only the m3 subtype may be found in other smooth muscle-containing organs. Both m1 and m3 are located in glandular tissues such as lacrimal gland, exocrine pancreas, and salivary gland (22Dorje F. Levey A.I. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 459-462PubMed Google Scholar). Functional receptors have been found in a variety of brain cell lines and brain cancer cell lines. An adherent variant small cell lung cancer cell line has been shown to express the m3 subtype receptor. mAChRs have not been reported previously in melanomas, a malignancy of basal layer pigmented neuroepithelial cells. We now demonstrate and biochemically characterize a m5 AChR in an early passage human melanoma cell line. This m5 receptor is present in extremely low abundance and mediates the inhibition of anchorage independent proliferation. It is functionally associated with a unique combination of signal transduction pathway coupling including calcium mobilization, release of arachidonic acid, inhibition of the generation of cAMP, and lack of inositol polyphosphate production. All radioligands for signal transduction and binding studies ([5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid and N-[methyl-3H]scopolamine), molecular studies, and the IP3 radioreceptor assay were obtained from Du Pont NEN. Fura-2 AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Reagents for molecular analyses, polymerase chain reaction, cloning, and sequencing were from Life Technologies, Inc./BRL (Gaithersburg, MD), Perkin-Elmer Instruments (Norwalk, CT), Invitrogen Corp. (San Diego, CA), and Amersham Life Sciences. Reagents used in the radioimmunoassay of cAMP were purchased from Dr. Gary Brooker (Department of Biochemistry, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, D. C.). Vitrogen was obtained from Collagen Corp. (Palo Alto, CA). Monoclonal anti-bovine phospholipase Cγ-1 (PLCγ-1), anti-bovine phospholipase Cβ-1, and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). 125I-Protein A was from Amersham. All other reagents were analytical or molecular grade. The early passage A2058 human melanoma cell line (≤ passage 20) was maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium with 10% fetal calf serum, as described, and used for no more than 8 passages (23Kohn E.C. Liotta L.A. Schiffmann E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sublines derived by limiting dilution cloning (A2058-1F5, ≤ passage 25) were studied preferentially, unless indicated otherwise. This subline has identical growth and functional characteristics as the parental A2058 cell line. Where indicated, CHO cells stably transfected with the m5AChR (CHOm5) were used as controls for the muscarinic receptor responses; these cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Polymerase chain reaction, subcloning, and sequencing, followed by Southern blotting or Northern blot analysis, were used to identify the mAChR subtype found in the A2058 cells. Oligonucleotides for PCR were as follows: hu-m5AChR sense primer (bp 340-360: AGCAACGCTTCTGTCATGAAC), antisense primer (bp 1555-1435: ATAGCACAACCAATAGCCCAA) (19Bonner T.I. Young A.C. Branmn M.R. Buckley N.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar); hu-m2AChR, sense primer (bp 290-307: AGCTTGGCCTGTGCTGAC), antisense primer (bp 1291-1272: GATGAAAGCCAACAGAAT); hu-m4AChR, sense primer (bp 554-574: AGCTTGGCCTGTGCTGAC), antisense primer (bp 1603-1583: GATGAAAGCCAACAGAAT). A smaller m5-specific PCR fragment was isolated from CHOm5 cells for use in Southern blots of the PCR reactions. The primers for this component of the m5AChR were: sense primer (bp 973-993: TACAAGAGTCAGGGTAAGGAA), antisense primer (bp 1191-1171: ACAGCCATTGTTGGTCTCCTG). All PCR fragments were subcloned into TA plasmid for sequencing using the Sequenase kit (Amersham) and subsequent riboprobe production as directed (Promega). cDNAs made from total RNA extracted from CHO m1-m5 cells and A2058-1F5 cells were used for amplification with the primer sets described above. Reaction products were electrophoresed on 10-20% gradient polyacrylamide TBE gels (Novex, San Diego, CA), viewed by ethidium bromide staining, and when indicated transferred to GeneScreen (Du Pont) for hybridization. Southern blots were hybridized with the small m5-specific riboprobe or with an end-labeled oligonucleotide conserved in both m2AChR and m4AChR (5′-CAACAGTCACTGACTGAGGTGG). Plasma membranes were prepared from A2058-1F5 cells as described previously, and competition and saturation binding assays were performed with N-[methyl-3H]scopolamine as described (24Felder C.C. MacArthur L. Ma A.L. Gusovsky F. Kohn E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1706-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Assay solutions were incubated for 1 h at 30°C in a final assay volume of 0.5 ml and a final membrane concentration of 40-400 µg of protein/ml. Membranes were rapidly filtered over Whatman GF/B filters pretreated for 3 h with 0.1% polyethyleneimine (v/v, pH 7.4) using an Inotech (Lansing, MI) multi-position cell harvester, and washed 3 times (50 mM Tris, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Filters containing washed membranes were transferred to scintillation vials and incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) overnight before addition of scintillation mixture and counting. Binding data were analyzed with the GraphPad program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) which performs weighted non-linear least squares curve fitting to the general model of Feldman (25Feldman H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 317-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Carbachol (CC), a stable acetylcholine analog, was used as the agonist for all signaling experiments and data are presented as percent stimulation (mean ± S.E.) of at least three independent experiments. The release of cAMP in response to CC stimulation of A2058-1F5 cells was measured as described previously using a radioimmunoassay (9Felder C.C. Kanterman R.Y. Ma A.L. Axelrod J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20356-20362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Felder C.C. Ma A.L. Liotta L.A. Kohn E.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 257: 967-971PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP accumulation was measured in the presence of calcium-free Eagle's number 2 media containing either 1 mM added CaCl2 or with addition of 0.5 mM EGTA. Where indicated, cells were incubated with pertussis toxin for up to 18 h prior to assay. Arachidonic acid release assays were performed as described (10Felder C.C. Dieter P. Kinsella J. Tamura K. Kanterman R.Y. Axelrod J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 1140-1147PubMed Google Scholar) with the following changes. A2058-1F5 cells were plated at 100,000 per well in 24-well plates and grown for 24 h to 80% confluence, after which they were labeled with 0.25 µCi of [3H]arachidonic acid for 18 h. Bicarbonate-free Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 1.0 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was used as the reaction buffer (Buffer A). Release reactions were carried out for 15 min unless stated otherwise. Intracellular calcium measurements were made using single cell fluorescence videoimaging as described (11Felder C.C. Poulter M. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on glass coverslips precoated with 10 ng/ml poly-L-lysine, air dried, and then overcoated with 300 µg/ml vitrogen. For imaging, cells were loaded with 1 µM FURA-2-acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min at 37°C in growth media, washed once, and stored in Eagle's number 2 media containing 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) at 25°C for no more than 45 min prior to use. Cells were bathed in buffer containing reagents and calcium as indicated. FURA-2 fluorescence was measured at an emission wavelength of 510 nm in single cells mounted on a Nikon Diaphot microscope illuminated alternately with 350 and 380 nm light (band pass 4 nm) using a SLM-Aminco DMX-1000 spectrofluorometer with an intensified CCD camera as the emission detector (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL). Data are presented as the ratio of fluorescence 340/380, as an index of changes in intracellular calcium concentration. Several experimental protocols for the quantitation of inositol phosphates were tested using CC stimulation of A2058 cells. These included chloroform/methanol extraction and Dowex AG 1-8 anion exchange chromatography (23Kohn E.C. Liotta L.A. Schiffmann E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a modification of this procedure (27Felder C.C. Kanterman R.Y. Ma A.L. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2187-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and the commercially available radioreceptor assay IP3 kit (DuPont NEN). Varied cell numbers and reaction times of 0-60 s and up to 15 min were tested. In all experiments, CHOm5 cells were used as a positive control. A2058 cell lysates were made from subconfluent cells either untreated or incubated with 20 µM CC for either 5 or 15 min using modified RIPA buffer in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant recovered. Lysate samples, 50 µg, were electrophoresed on 4-12% gradient polyacrylamide gels, transferred, blocked, and probed with antibody against phospholipase Cβ-1, 5 µg/ml, or PLCγ-1, 0.1 µg/ml. Blots were washed, incubated with 125I-protein A, and exposed to film. For immunoprecipitations, equal protein quantities were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1 µg/100 µg of protein) or anti-PLCγ-1 (0.1 µg/100 µg of protein) for 90 min at 4°C. Immunocomplexes were collected with 50 µl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C, washed with RIPA buffer, eluted in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, and then processed as described for the immunoblot. Immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted overnight with anti-PLCγ-1 (0.1 µg/ml) and visualized as above (28Kohn E.C. Alessandro R. Spoonster J. Wersto R. Liotta L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The effect of CC on colony formation in soft agar was determined as described (24Felder C.C. MacArthur L. Ma A.L. Gusovsky F. Kohn E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1706-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Kohn E.C. Felder C.C. Jacobs W. Holmes K.A. Day A.F. Freer R. Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty million A2058 cells were plated into a top 3% agar layer in complete media with CC, atropine, both agents, or neither. After culture for 10 days, colonies were counted under phase-contrast microscopy. Data presented are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Unpaired Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. Oligonucleotides from conserved transmembrane domains were used initially to PCR amplify a segment of the A2058 mAChR. When the initial fragments were sequenced and confirmed to have high homology to the m5 subtype, further PCR amplification reactions used more selective oligonucleotides. Fig. 1 shows the results of PCR amplification of RNA from CHO cells stably transfected with the human m1-m5AChR (lanes 1-5 in each panel) for comparison to the results for the A2058-1F5 line (lane 6). In Fig. 1A, one major band with a size of 1200 bp was amplified using primers selected for m5 and was found only in CHOm5 and A2058-1F5 lanes. This fragment size agreed with the expected size of the amplified region for the m5AChR gene but is not the correct size for the smaller m1 and m3 transcripts, 900 and 983 bp, respectively. No amplified products were observed from the reactions using cDNA from CHOm1, m2, m3, and m4 cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-4, respectively). To rule out undetectable products from m1-m4 and to confirm the identify of the band in the m5 and 1F5 lanes, Southern analysis was performed using as a probe a 200-bp PCR product selective for a segment of the third cytoplasmic domain of the m5AChR (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). In order to show that there is only one species of AChR in the A2058 cells, further PCR amplification was done using oligonucleotides selective to the even-numbered AChRs. A band of approximate size of 900 bp was demonstrated only in the CHO m2 and m4 cells after amplification with m2/m4 oligonucleotide pairs. Southern blot hybridization of those gels with an internal and selective m2/4 oligonucleotide confirmed that the 900-bp transcript was present only in the CHOm2 and m4 cells and not in the A2058-1F5 cells. The full coding length of the A2058 AChR has been amplified, subcloned, and sequenced and was found to be homologous to that of the hu-m5AChR. These results demonstrate that the mAChR on the A2058 cells is genetically a m5 muscarinic receptor. m5 receptor expression level and receptor affinity were determined by radioligand binding experiments. Saturation binding experiments were performed in which N-[methyl-3H]scopolamine was used to define total binding and unlabeled 10 µM atropine was added to saturate specific binding. Fig. 2 shows the binding characteristics of this receptor. Greater than 90% specific binding was observed in A2058 plasma membranes with binding constants of Kd = 99 ± 6 pM and Bmax = 45 ± 4 fmol/mg of membrane protein. Forskolin treatment of A2058 cells resulted in production of cAMP as shown in Fig. 3A. No production of cAMP was observed when A2058-1F5 cells were exposed to CC in concentrations up to 1 mM (data not shown), as would be expected for an odd-numbered muscarinic receptor signaling profile. In contrast, CC exposure inhibited the stimulation of cAMP production in response to forskolin in a dose dependent fashion, but only by 60%. This was investigated further by exposure to pertussis toxin and by removal of extracellular calcium from the reaction medium. When cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin for up to 18 h prior to activation with forskolin, with or without additional CC, no reversal of the effect of CC on cAMP production was demonstrated. Treatment with pertussis toxin did not effect the basal levels of cAMP produced in response to CC treatment alone but increased the forskolin-stimulated cAMP, suggesting the relief of a tonic inhibition by the pertussis toxin incubation. Removal of extracellular calcium from the reaction mixture resulted in abrogation of 50% of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. While this effect was observed independently of concomitant exposure to CC, it abrogated the CC-sensitive component (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the CC-mediated inhibition of cAMP production may be due to mAChR-stimulated influx of calcium and that there may be multiple isotypes of adenylyl cyclase activated by forskolin in these cells (described below, Fig. 8).Fig. 8Effect of carbachol on intracellular calcium release and calcium influx. A2058 cells were plated and allowed to adhere overnight on coated coverslips, washed free of serum, and loaded with the cell permeant FURA-2 AM, 1 µM. Cells were perifused with medium containing 2 mM calcium or with calcium-free Eagle's number 2 medium containing 0.5 mM EGTA as indicated. Results are expressed as the ratio of 510 nm emission intensity measured following excitation at 350 nm/380 nm wavelengths. Data presented are representative traces from a single cell randomly selected from at least three experiments with at least 5 cells measured during each experiment. A, demonstration of internal calcium release followed by receptor-operated calcium influx. Cells were exposed to CC in calcium-containing media after which atropine, 10 µM, was added. B, separation of intracellular release and calcium influx in response to CC. In calcium-free media, cells were exposed to CC, washed free of CC, and re-exposed to CC as indicated. Following emptying of the intracellular stores, cells were perifused with calcium-containing media and calcium influx is observed. C, desensitization of internal release in the absence of refilling of internal stores. Continuous exposure to CC in the absence and presence of calcium-containing media is associated with desensitization of the internal release response to CC that required calcium influx to allow internal pool refilling in the absence of stimulus prior to second response to CC with internal release of calcium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of CC to stimulate production of inositol polyphosphates in the A2058 cells was approached with several different experimental designs. These included two different organic solvent separations and an inositol trisphosphate radioreceptor assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, no stimulation of inositol trisphosphate could be detected with the very sensitive radioreceptor assay in the face of a 2-fold stimulation in the CHOm5 control cells. Inositol monophosphate, diphosphate, or total inositol polyphosphates were not detectable using organic extraction and anion exchange chromatography methods in response to CC exposure of A2058 cells. Inositol trisphosphate production has been demonstrated previously in these cells in response to autocrine motility factor activation (23Kohn E.C. Liotta L.A. Schiffmann E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunoblot was used to investigate the expression of phospholipase C isozymes in the A2058 cells. Fig. 4B shows the presence of both phospholipase C-β1 and phospholipase C-γ isozymes in lysates of A2058 cells. Since phospholipase C-γ requires phosphorylation for activation, the ability of CC to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation was tested with 5- and 15-min exposures to CC (Fig. 4C). Very minimal phosphorylation was observed at either time point, suggesting that this isotype is not a major downstream effector of the m5AChR in these cells. CC stimulated a concentration-dependent release of arachidonic acid from the A2058-1F5 cells (EC50 = 17.8 ± 0.1 µM, Fig. 5A). Arachidonic acid release was blocked by co-incubation with atropine, the muscarinic receptor antagonist (Fig. 5B). CC-stimulated arachidonic acid release was first observed within 2 min of agonist addition. A plateau was reached by 10 min and was sustained for 30-60 min (Fig. 5A). All further arachidonic acid release experiments were allowed to proceed for 15 min. A2058 cells were incubated with PMA for 15 min, 1, or 24 h to determine the effect of activation and down-regulation of protein kinase C on release of arachidonic acid (Fig. 6). Inclusion of PMA alone for 15 min resulted in a 200% increase in released arachidonic acid which rose to 400%, equivalent to that seen with CC treatment, at a 1-h exposure. An additive effect was observed when cells were exposed to PMA for 1 h followed by CC treatment, suggesting that arachidonic acid release could be stimulated in A2058 cells by protein kinase C, independently of muscarinic receptor-mediated activation. A 24-h exposure of A2058 cells to PMA to down-regulate cellular protein kinase C activity inhibited the CC-stimulated response by approximately 50% and abrogated the PMA-induced arachidonic acid release seen at 1 h, consistent with a requirement for protein kinase C in activation of this response. The mAChR-stimulated release of arachidonic acid from A2058 cells was partially dependent upon extracellular calcium as shown in Fig. 7. Inclusion of the heavy metal cobalt or the Ca2+ chelator EGTA in the reaction media markedly reduced CC-induced arachidonic acid release (Fig. 7A). Mobilization of calcium through calcium influx can occur through voltage-dependent or independent channels. The voltage-sensitivity of the stimulated arachidonic acid release was fur"
https://openalex.org/W2111438894,"Secretogranin III (SgIII) is an acidic protein of unknown function that is present in the storage vesicles of many neuroendocrine cells. It is coexpressed with the prohormone proopiomelanocortin in the intermediate pituitary of Xenopus laevis. We developed an antiserum to investigate the biosynthesis of SgIII in pulse-chase incubated Xenopus neurointermediate lobes. SgIII was synthesized as a 61- or 63-kDa (N-glycosylated) protein and processed to a 48-kDa form which, in turn, was partially cleaved to fragments of 28 and 20 kDa. The 48-, 28-, and 20-kDa cleavage products, but not their precursors, were secreted. This secretion is regulated and can be blocked in parallel with that of proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides by the hypothalamic factors dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and neuropeptide Y. Coexpression of Xenopus SgIII with prohormone convertase (PC)1 or PC2 in transfected fibroblasts was sufficient to reconstitute the processing events observed in the neurointermediate lobes. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Xenopus SgIII is cleaved at two dibasic sites, namely Lys68-Arg69 and Arg237-Arg238. Pulse-chase incubations of lobes with Na2[35S]SO4 showed that SgIII is sulfated in the trans-Golgi network before it is processed. Finally, SgIII processing was found in several neuroendocrine cell types from various species. We conclude that SgIII is a precursor protein and that the intact molecule can only have an intracellular function, whereas an extracellular role can only be attributed to its cleavage products.

We conclude that SgIII is a precursor protein and that the intact molecule can only have an intracellular function, whereas an extracellular role can only be attributed to its cleavage products. A hallmark of neuroendocrine cells is their ability to synthesize, store, and release biologically active peptides in a regulated fashion. Most neuropeptides and peptide hormones are generated from inactive precursor proteins that are proteolytically processed at pairs of basic amino acids and often further modified to yield a functional product (1Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Google Scholar). The bulk of these modifications occurs subsequent to the sorting of peptide precursors, along with their processing enzymes, into secretory granules. These specialized storage vesicles deliver their contents to the cell surface only in response to an external signal. Besides peptides and processing enzymes, secretory granules contain a group of acidic secretory proteins, collectively known as the granin (chromogranin/secretogranin) family (2Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Google Scholar). Within this family, only chromogranin A (CgA) 1The abbreviations used are: CgchromograninBFAbrefeldin AGABAγ-aminobutyric acidNILneurointermediate lobeNPYneuropeptide YPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCprohormone convertasePOMCproopiomelanocortinSgsecretograninTGNtrans-Golgi network. and CgB (secretogranin I, SgI) show a structural relationship. Granins are characterized by acidic isoelectric points and by the presence of numerous pairs of basic amino acids, some of which are used by endoproteolytic enzymes. Unlike peptide hormones and processing enzymes, which have well defined functions in the neuroendocrine system, the physiological role of the granins is unclear. One hypothesis is that granins themselves are precursors for biologically active peptides. This notion is supported by the observation that peptides derived from proteolytic processing of CgA and SgII are capable of modulating secretion in an autocrine or paracrine manner (3Galindo E. Rill A. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1426-1430Google Scholar, 4Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G. Feistner G.J. Barchar J.D.

However, recent experimental evidence suggests that at least some granins function intracellularly as helper proteins in the sorting and proteolytic processing of prohormones. For instance, overexpression of CgB in anterior pituitary-derived AtT20 cells was found to promote the aggregation-dependent sorting of proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived cleavage products into secretory granules (6Huttner W.B. Natori S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 242-245Google Scholar). Furthermore, the neuroendocrine protein 7B2 (SgV) physically interacts with the proform of prohormone convertase PC2 and seems to regulate both transport and activation of this processing enzyme in the secretory pathway (7Martens G.J.M.

One of the granins whose function has remained elusive is SgIII. Its transcript was originally identified from rat brain during a search for mRNAs that are exclusively expressed in the central nervous system (11Ottiger H.-P. Battenberg E.F. Tsou A.P. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3135-3147Google Scholar). The protein was detected in many brain areas, especially in neurons participating in auditory, olfactory, and extrapyramidal motor functions, as well as in those related to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Moreover, SgIII was found in cells of the intermediate and anterior pituitary, whereas ultrastructural studies demonstrated its presence in intracellular vesicles (11Ottiger H.-P. Battenberg E.F. Tsou A.P. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3135-3147Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of the gene in mice revealed that animals lacking SgIII survive without any obvious impairment in viability, fertility, or locomotor behavior (12Kingsley D.M. Rinchick E.M. Russell L.B. Ottiger H.-P. Sutcliffe J.G. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 395-399Google Scholar). Consequently, many of the cell types that normally express SgIII can function in the absence of this protein, perhaps because its physiological role can be replaced by that of another gene product. Recently, we cloned the first nonmammalian homolog of SgIII from the amphibian Xenopus laevis. This was achieved by a differential screening strategy designed to identify genes coexpressed with POMC in the melanotrope cells of the intermediate pituitary (13Holthuis J.C.M. Jansen E.J.R. Van Riel M.C.H.M. Martens G.J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3295-3305Google Scholar). In these cells, the production levels of POMC-derived melanophore-stimulating peptides can be manipulated in vivo by changing the background color of the toad. When the animal is placed on a black background, the mRNA levels of SgIII in the intermediate pituitary increase dramatically (up to 35-fold) and in parallel with that of POMC (30-fold increase) (14Holthuis J.C.M. Martens G.J.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), suggesting that SgIII has a role in the production and release of peptide hormones. In the present study, we investigate the biosynthesis of SgIII in Xenopus melanotropes, taking advantage of the high metabolic activity of these cells in black-adapted animals. We find that SgIII is a sulfated precursor protein and demonstrate that proteolytic processing occurs at two dibasic sites that are recognized by the prohormone convertases PC1 and PC2. South-African clawed toads, Xenopus laevis, were adapted to a black background by keeping them in black buckets under constant illumination for at least 3 weeks at 22°C. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against recombinant Xenopus SgIII produced in Escherichia coli using the Qiagen expression system (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). For this purpose, a 1.5-kb BamHI fragment of Xenopus SgIII cDNA clone X8596 (14Holthuis J.C.M. Martens G.J.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar) was ligated into the BamHI site of the prokaryotic expression vector pQE-30. This allowed the production of recombinant protein composed of Xenopus SgIII residues −8 to 437 with a hexahistidine tail at its amino terminus. Following purification of the protein by Ni2+-NTA agarose affinity chromatography, a 500-µg initial dose emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant was administered to rabbits at 20 subcutaneous sites. After 3 and 6 weeks, rabbits were boosted with 250 µg of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The production of specific antibodies was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NILs from black-adapted Xenopus were dissected and preincubated in incubation medium (IM, 112 mM NaCl; 2 mM KCl; 2 mM CaCl2; 15 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mg/ml glucose, pH 7.4) at 22°C for 20 min. Pulse labeling of newly synthesized proteins was performed by incubating lobes in IM containing 1.7 mCi/ml Tran[35S]-label (ICN Radiochemicals) for the indicated periods at 22°C. Subsequent chase incubations were in IM containing 5 mML-methionine. Pulse labeling of sulfated proteins was achieved by incubating lobes in 1.3 mCi/ml Na2[35S]SO4 (ICN Radiochemicals). Subsequent chase incubations were in IM containing 1 mM Na2SO4. Drugs and secretagogues described in the text were added in the 20-min preincubation period and remained present during subsequent pulse and chase incubations. Lobes were homogenized on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Tween 20, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Homogenates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 7 min at 4°C), supplemented with 0.1 volume of 10% SDS and diluted 10-fold in lysis buffer before addition of anti-SgIII antiserum (1:5000 dilution). Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (LKB-Pharmacia) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography. A 1.7-kb BamHI fragment of Xenopus SgIII cDNA clone X8596-1 encoding the entire protein (14Holthuis J.C.M. Martens G.J.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar) was subcloned downstream of the cytomegalovirus promotor into the BamHI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). A 2.7-kb HindIII-EcoRV fragment of plasmid pIP83 covering the entire open reading frame of human PC1 (a generous gift of Dr. A. Roebroek, University of Leuven) (15Creemers J.W.M. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 82-88Google Scholar) was subcloned in the HindIII/EcoRV sites of pcDNA3. The pcDNA3 vector containing a full-length 2.2-kb human PC2 cDNA was obtained from Dr. J. Creemers (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom). DNA for transfection studies was isolated using the Qiagen plasmid kit (Qiagen Inc.). A 1.7-kb BamHI fragment of Xenopus SgIII cDNA clone X8596-1 was subcloned into the BamHI site of the pALTER-1 vector, and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed on single-stranded DNA using the pALTER system (Promega, Madison, WI). The desired mutations were checked by restriction enzyme digestion and double-stranded DNA sequencing. Correctly mutagenized SgIII DNA inserts were subcloned into pcDNA3. Oligonucleotides used to create amino acid substitutions in dibasic cleavage sites of SgIII were 5′-GGTGATGTGACTAGTAGTGGAAGC-3′ (KR69→ TS69) and 5′-CTGTGGAGAGCTCGAACGAATTA-3′ (RR238→ SS238). All cell culture media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Green monkey CV-1 kidney fibroblasts were cultured in Iscove's modified Eagle's medium, mouse anterior pituitary-derived AtT20 cells, and mouse glucagon-producing αTC4 cells in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and mouse insuloma βTC3 cells in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Transfection of CV-1 and AtT20 cells was accomplished by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (16Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Google Scholar). AtT20 cells were transfected with the Xenopus SgIII-pcDNA3 construct and after 48 h selected for stable expression of SgIII in medium containing 750 µg/ml neomycin (Boehringer Mannheim). For transient expression studies, CV-1 cells were plated in 20-mm culture dishes, grown until 30% confluency, and transfected with 2.5 µg of DNA per construct per dish. CV-1 cells (48 h after transfection) and other cell types were starved for 60 min in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN Biochemicals) supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subsequently pulsed for 180 min in the same medium with 0.2 mCi/ml Tran[35S]-label. Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer, and the cell lysates and incubation media were processed for immunoprecipitation analysis as described above. To investigate the biosynthesis of SgIII in the neurointermediate lobe (NIL) of Xenopus, we raised a polyclonal antiserum against a recombinant protein comprising Xenopus SgIII residues −8 to 437 (Fig. 1). In immunofluorescence studies on primary cultures of NILs dissected from black-adapted animals, the antiserum gave a bright staining of the melanotrope cells, whereas no immunostaining above background was detected in other (minor) cell types (e.g. stellate cells, endothelial cells). 2J. C. M. Holthuis, E. J. R. Jansen, and G. J. M. Martens, unpublished observations. These findings suggest that the melanotropes constitute the primary site of SgIII production in the NIL. When NILs from black animals were pulsed for 15 min with Tran[35S]-label and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with the antiserum, two major radiolabeled proteins of 63 and 61 kDa were detected (Fig. 2, lane 2). These proteins were not immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum (Fig. 2, lane 1), indicating that they represent newly synthesized SgIII. Pulse-chase incubations revealed that these proteins are proteolytically processed, first yielding a 48-kDa product which is then partially cleaved into fragments of 28 and 20 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 3-5). Analysis of the chase media showed that only the 48-, 28-, and 20-kDa cleavage products, but not the 63- and 61-kDa precursors, are released into the medium (Fig. 2, lane 9). Collectively, these data demonstrate that SgIII is a secretory precursor protein and suggest that at least two of the seven potential dibasic cleavage sites present within its sequence (Fig. 1) are used by endoproteolytic enzymes.Fig. 2Immunoprecipitation analysis of intracellular and secreted forms of SgIII produced by Xenopus neurointermediate lobes. Lobes were pulsed for 15 min with Tran[35S]-label or pulsed for 15 min and chased for 30, 60, or 240 min. Radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated from lobe extracts (two lobes per lane) and chase media using preimmune serum (lane 1) or anti-SgIII antiserum (lanes 2-9). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Protein markers for molecular mass (M) are indicated on the left. Migration positions of newly synthesized POMC and an 18-kDa POMC-derived cleavage product in total protein extracts (lanes 10-17; 0.04 lobe per lane) are indicated on the right. Note the presence of a nonspecifically reacting 37-kDa POMC band in some of the immunoprecipitates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When NILs were preincubated and pulsed in the presence of tunicamycin (a blocker of N-linked glycosylation), the mobility of the 63-kDa precursor protein increased by 2 kDa, whereas the migration of the 61-kDa precursor and the three cleavage products remained unchanged.2 This result indicates that SgIII is partially glycosylated at Asn47, the single putative acceptor site for N-linked glycosylation found within its primary sequence (Fig. 1). Moreover, it can be concluded that when intact SgIII is converted to the 48-kDa cleavage product, the glycosylated amino-terminal portion of the protein is cleaved. The mobility of nonglycosylated intact SgIII produced by Xenopus melanotropes in SDS-PAGE gels (61 kDa) is considerably slower than one would predict from its amino acid sequence (calculated molecular mass, 49,744 Da). Similar discrepancies were found for other members of the granin family (17Benedum U.M. Baeuerle P.A. Konecki D.S. Frank R. Powell J. Mallet J. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1495-1502Google Scholar, 18Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Phillips E. Baeuerle P.A. Frank R. Argos P. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12009-12015Google Scholar). At present, it is unclear to what extent post-translational modifications contribute to this phenomenon (i.e. phosphorylation, O-linked glycosylation, and sulfation) or whether the highly acidic nature of these proteins causes anomalous behavior on SDS-PAGE in the Laemmli system. The release of the POMC-derived peptide α-MSH from melanotrope cells is negatively controlled by various factors of hypothalamic origin. These include dopamine, GABA, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) (19Verburg-van Kemenade B.M.L. Jenks B.G. Driessen A.G.J. Brain Res. Bull. 1986; 17: 697-704Google Scholar, 20Verburg-van Kemenade B.M.L.

Neurosci. 1992; 12: 864-871Google Scholar). To investigate whether secretion of the SgIII-derived cleavage products is a regulated event, NILs were pulsed for 60 min and chased for 210 min in the absence or presence of these secretagogues. Secretion of the SgIII cleavage products was completely blocked by the D2 dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine, as well as by GABA and NPY (Fig. 3). In all three cases, the inhibition led to an accumulation of SgIII cleavage products in the lobes while the precursor proteins did not accumulate, indicating that these secretagogues had not interfered with SgIII processing. Analysis of the incubation media and lobe extracts showed that the transport of POMC-derived cleavage products was affected in a similar way. These results demonstrate that the secretion of SgIII- and POMC-derived peptides by Xenopus melanotropes is regulated in a coordinated manner. To determine the secretory compartment in which processing of SgIII occurs, we conducted pulse-chase experiments on NILs in the presence or absence of the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) or the sodium ionophore monensin. BFA causes an accumulation of newly synthesized secretory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (22Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Google Scholar), whereas monensin is known to interfere with protein transport between Golgi compartments (23Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Google Scholar). Treatment of the lobes with these drugs strongly inhibited the generation of SgIII cleavage products and completely blocked their release into the medium, whereas an intracellular accumulation of the SgIII precursor forms was observed (Fig. 4). These findings suggest that the first proteolytic conversion of SgIII does not occur before the protein has reached the distal part of the Golgi apparatus. The minor amount of 48-kDa cleavage product formed in the drug-treated lobes indicates that some SgIII had escaped from the blocks. This was also found for some newly synthesized POMC,2 a prohormone whose processing is known to occur distal to the site of action of these drugs (24Devault A. Zollinger M. Crine P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 259: 5146-5151Google Scholar). Tyrosine sulfation is a post-translational modification mediated by a protein tyrosine-sulfotransferase found in the TGN (25Niehrs C. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 35-42Google Scholar). This modification may affect the biological activity or intracellular transport of a protein (26Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 363-376Google Scholar). We noticed that the Xenopus SgIII sequence contains a putative sulfation site on Tyr110 (Fig. 1), and we decided to analyze sulfated forms of SgIII in order to further define the compartment where its processing occurs. After a 10-min pulse of NILs with Na2[35S]SO4, the majority of immunoprecipitable radioactivity was found associated with the 61- and 63-kDa precursor forms of SgIII (Fig. 5). Following a 20-min pulse, only a small amount of the 48-kDa cleavage product was observed. After an additional chase of 40 min, most of the radioactivity was associated with the 48-kDa cleavage product. A chase of 120 min allowed detection of both the 48- and 20-kDa cleavage products but not the 28-kDa fragment, whereas the radioactivity associated with the 61- and 63-kDa precursors further decreased. Only the 48- and 20-kDa forms could be detected in the chase medium. Together, these data demonstrate that sulfation of SgIII precedes its proteolytic processing and that the protein reaches the TGN in an intact form. Tooze et al. (27Tooze S.A. Flatmark T. Tooze J. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1491-1503Google Scholar) showed that in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells the sulfation and subsequent sorting of SgII from the TGN to immature secretory granules occurs within a time interval of 20 min. Our pulse-chase analysis revealed a lag period of about 20 min between SgIII sulfation and the appearance of the first cleavage product (Fig. 5). This finding suggests that SgIII processing in Xenopus melanotropes starts in the immature secretory granules. To determine if the proteolytic system responsible for SgIII processing is restricted to cells of neuroendocrine origin, CV-1 kidney fibroblasts were transfected with a Xenopus SgIII cDNA construct and pulsed with Tran[35S]-label for 180 min. Immunoprecipitation analysis of the cell lysate and incubation medium revealed two newly synthesized proteins of 61 and 63 kDa (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2) whose migrations on SDS-PAGE are identical to those of the intact SgIII precursors produced in Xenopus NILs (Fig. 6, lane 3). Both lysates and incubation media of transfected cells were devoid of SgIII-derived cleavage products, indicating that CV-1 fibroblasts are not equipped with the proteolytic system by which SgIII is processed in Xenopus melanotropes. The prohormone convertases PC1 (also termed PC3) and PC2 represent two neuroendocrine-specific members of the subtilisin family of endoproteases and are responsible for the proteolytic conversion of a wide range of prohormones and other peptide precursors at pairs of basic amino acids (28Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Google Scholar, 29Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 175-188Google Scholar). To investigate their possible involvement in SgIII processing, CV-1 cells were cotransfected with SgIII and PC1 or PC2 cDNA constructs, pulse-labeled, and analyzed for the biosynthesis of SgIII. The incubation medium of cells cotransfected with SgIII and PC2 contained, in addition to the SgIII precursor forms, three smaller immunoreactive proteins whose sizes were indistinguishable from the SgIII-derived cleavage products generated in Xenopus NILs (Fig. 6, compare lanes 3 and 6). The same set of radiolabeled proteins could be immunoprecipitated from the incubation medium of cells cotransfected with SgIII and PC1 (Fig. 6, lane 8). The 20-kDa cleavage product generated in CV-1 cells often appeared as a smear in the gel (e.g. see Fig. 6, lane 7), hampering its detection in some of our experiments. This smearing, which was also evident for the 63-kDa precursor form, may relate to additional post-translational modifications of SgIII when produced in fibroblasts. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that both PC1 and PC2 recognize SgIII as a suitable substrate. Unlike PC1, PC2 is a highly abundant protein in Xenopus melanotropes (13Holthuis J.C.M. Jansen E.J.R. Van Riel M.C.H.M. Martens G.J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3295-3305Google Scholar, 30Braks J.A.M. Goldenmond K.C.W. Van Riel M.C.H.M. Coenen A.J.M. Martens G.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 305: 45-50Google Scholar) and therefore represents the most likely enzyme to be responsible for the processing of SgIII in these cells. Xenopus SgIII contains seven potential dibasic cleavage sites (Fig. 1). As mentioned above, the first cleavage yielding the 48-kDa product is in the amino-terminal region of the protein, yet carboxyl-terminal of the N-linked glycosylation site (Asn47). We noticed that upon cleavage of the 48-kDa product, 2- to 3-times more radioactivity remains associated with the 28-kDa fragment than with the 20-kDa fragment (see Fig. 2 or 3). Combined with the distribution of methionines in the SgIII polypeptide sequence (Fig. 1), these observations led us to predict that the first cleavage of SgIII occurs at the Lys68-Arg69 site and the second cleavage at the Arg237-Arg238 site. To test this hypothesis, amino acid substitutions were introduced at these sites, and the mutated proteins were coexpressed with PC2 in CV-1 fibroblasts. The mutant in which the Lys68-Arg69 site was substituted by Thr68-Ser69 gave rise to the SgIII precursor forms and a single cleavage product of 28 kDa (Fig. 7, lane 3). Other potential SgIII fragments were undetectable, even in overexposed gels. When the Arg237-Arg238 site was substituted by Ser237-Ser238, only one cleavage product of 48 kDa was detected (Fig. 7, lane 4). The intact precursors but no cleavage products were observed after expressing the mutant that carried substitutions at both sites (Fig. 7, lane 5). Together, these results confirm our prediction that the endoproteolytic conversion of SgIII in Xenopus melanotropes results from cleavages at Lys68-Arg69 and Arg237-Arg238. A schematic representation of SgIII processing in Xenopus melanotropes is given in Fig. 8.Fig. 8Schematic representation of SgIII processing in Xenopus melanotrope cells. Data from Figs. 2, 4, 5, and 7 are summarized. The amino-terminal (partially N-glycosylated) fragment formed after cleavage at the KR69 site was not detected in our pulse-chase experiments, probably because it is not recognized by the antiserum.

See text for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Western blot analysis revealed that Xenopus brain and anterior pituitary lobes contain the same set of SgIII-derived cleavage products as those generated in Xenopus NILs,2 indicating that SgIII is processed in a variety of neuroendocrine cell types. Following immunoprecipitation analysis of pulse-labeled NILs and anterior pituitary lobes from rat, a single SgIII precursor of 62 kDa and two cleavage products of 48 and 31 kDa were detected.2 Radiolabeled proteins of the same sizes were also immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and incubation media of pulsed mouse insuloma βTC3 cells, glucagon-producing αTC4 cells, and anterior pituitary-derived AtT20 cells (Fig. 9, lanes 1-6). When AtT20 cells were stably transfected with Xenopus SgIII, additional products of 63-, 28-, and 20 kDa were found (Fig. 9, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, the dissimilarities in SgIII cleavage patterns observed between Xenopus and rodent cells probably result from species-related differences in the primary structures of the proteins. For example, rodent SgIII lacks the functional Lys68-Arg69 cleavage site found in the Xenopus protein (14Holthuis J.C.M. Martens G.J.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). The identification of a bovine chromaffin granule-associated peptide corresponding to the region amino-terminal of the dibasic Arg95-Lys96 in rodent SgIII (31Sigafoos J. Chestnut W.G. Merrill B.M. Taylor L.C.E. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. J. Anat. 1993; 183: 253-264Google Scholar), a pair not present in the Xenopus protein, further substantiates the notion that SgIII processing in the various species involves dibasic sites that are not conserved during vertebrate evolution. Ottiger et al. (11Ottiger H.-P. Battenberg E.F. Tsou A.P. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3135-3147Google Scholar) previously reported on a single SgIII protein of ∼57 kDa which was detected by Western blot analysis in various regions of the rat brain. We did not observe a newly synthesized SgIII-related protein of this size in rat pituitary or mouse endocrine cells. In view of the present data, the possibility should be considered that the protein detected by Ottiger and co-workers (11Ottiger H.-P. Battenberg E.F. Tsou A.P. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3135-3147Google Scholar) does not represent intact SgIII but is a SgIII-derived cleavage product. In this study, we have shown that SgIII is a sulfated precursor protein whose endoproteolytic processing is a wide-spread phenomenon in the neuroendocrine system of vertebrates. At present, the significance of SgIII processing is unclear. The possibility that it serves to liberate functionally important peptides, conforming to what has been proposed for CgA and SgII (3Galindo E. Rill A. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1426-1430Google Scholar, 4Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G. Feistner G.J. Barchar J.D. Nature. 1986; 324: 476-478Google Scholar, 5Saria A. Troger J. Kirchmair R. Fischer-Colbrie R. Hogue-Angeletti R. Winkler H. Neuroscience. 1993; 54: 1-4Google Scholar), is unlikely. First, the majority of potential dibasic cleavage sites in SgIII is not conserved during vertebrate evolution (14Holthuis J.C.M. Martens G.J.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Moreover, our present data demonstrate that Xenopus SgIII is fully processed at the nonconserved Lys68-Arg69 site, whereas only partial cleavage occurs at the conserved Arg237-Arg238 site (as diagrammed in Fig. 8). Therefore, if SgIII belongs to the group of prohormones and neuropeptide precursors, it would represent a notable exception since the members of this class are generally cleaved at conserved dibasic sites (32Martens G.J.M. Civelli O. Herbert E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13685-13689Google Scholar). Second, a comparative analysis of SgIII protein sequences from Xenopus and rodents showed that regions with the highest degree of sequence identity (over 90%) are not flanked by dibasic sites (14Holthuis J.C.M. Martens G.J.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), in contrast to what one would expect for a genuine peptide precursor. In fact, the two functional cleavage sites in Xenopus SgIII each reside within a poorly conserved region where the degree of sequence identity has dropped below 30%. If not to liberate bioactive peptides, what then is the purpose of SgIII processing? It may terminate a function exerted by the intact protein in the early secretory compartments. An interesting example in this respect concerns the neuroendocrine protein 7B2 (SgV). When travelling through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments, the uncleaved form of 7B2 is associated with and appears to prevent premature activation of pro-PC2 (7Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5787Google Scholar, 8Braks J.A.M. Martens G.J.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 263-273Google Scholar, 10Benjannet S. Savaria D. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2303-2311Google Scholar). Upon arrival in the TGN, 7B2 is cleaved and dissociates from pro-PC2, allowing the proenzyme to mature. Given the existence of a private chaperone for PC2, it is conceivable that additional helper proteins interact with other enzymes in the secretory pathway. If SgIII represents such a helper protein, then its processing could trigger complex dissociation. Another possibility is that SgIII promotes the selective aggregation of luminal proteins and their subsequent packaging into secretory granules, whereby its processing serves to dissolve and/or facilitate maturation of the granular content. Alternatively, the proteolytic conversion of SgIII may simply reflect the fate of the protein in the regulated secretory pathway rather than being essential for its mechanism of action. The function of SgIII remains to be established. Neither the genetic ablation of its gene in mice (12Kingsley D.M. Rinchick E.M. Russell L.B. Ottiger H.-P. Sutcliffe J.G. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 395-399Google Scholar) nor its overexpression in cultured neuroendocrine cells2 has provided any clue with respect to the role of this protein in the neuroendocrine system. The results of our present study show that SgIII itself is a precursor molecule and can only have an intracellular function, whereas an extracellular role can only be attributed to SgIII-derived peptides. We are grateful to K. Janssen and Y. Croes for technical assistance, R. Engels for animal care, and D. Eib and M. van Horssen for critically reading the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W1968930028,"Apoptotic cell death has been correlated to DNA fragmentation into discrete segments corresponding to the length of nucleosomal protected fragments of 180–200 base pairs or multiples of it. This DNA degradation has been ascribed to endonuclease activity that cleaves internucleosomally, thus giving rise to a ladder distribution upon electrophoretic migration. This strict correlation was, however, shown to have notable exceptions, since in some cases only single strand cleavage in the internucleosomal DNA regions has been observed (Tomei, D. L., Shapiro, P. J., and Cope, O. F. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 853–857). In the present work we show that mouse muscle cells, able to differentiate in vitro, if subjected to apoptosis present no DNA degradation into ladder form unless differentiation is previously induced. Furthermore, C3H/10T1/2 fibroblast cells, known to undergo apoptosis without DNA ladder formation, if converted to a myogenic program by MyoD expression, display internucleosomal DNA degradation upon induction of differentiation.

Furthermore, C3H/10T1/2 fibroblast cells, known to undergo apoptosis without DNA ladder formation, if converted to a myogenic program by MyoD expression, display internucleosomal DNA degradation upon induction of differentiation. A set of biochemical and morphological features characterizes the process of cell death by apoptosis (1Martin J.S. Douglas R.G. Cotter G.T. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 26-28Google Scholar). This phenomenon, associated with several developmental processes and tissue homeostasis, is often called programmed cell death to indicate a physiological, naturally occurring cell death (2Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Google Scholar, 3Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Google Scholar). In addition to physiological stimuli, apoptosis can also be induced both in vivo and in vitro by a variety of cytotoxic drugs and physical stimuli (4Barry M.A. Behnke C.A. Eastman A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 2352-2362Google Scholar, 5Bertrand R. Kerrigan D. Saragan M. Pommier Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 77-85Google Scholar, 6Chow S.C. Peters I. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 149-159Google Scholar) and is characterized by some typical parameters such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, nuclear apoptotic bodies, and DNA degradation that clearly differentiate this cell death from necrosis (for reviews on apoptosis and programmed cell death see 1Martin J.S. Douglas R.G. Cotter G.T. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 26-28Google Scholar and 7Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Google Scholar, 8Vaux L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For many years it was thought that the strictest marker of apoptosis was the DNA degradation in fragments of oligonucleosomal size (multiples of approximately 180 base pairs). This fragmentation is easily evidenced by the electrophoretic migration of DNA into a ladder configuration. Although internucleosomal DNA degradation has long been considered the cause of chromatin morphological alterations, in the last years many investigators have observed apoptotic phenotypes in the absence of ladder formation. In these cases, however, other types of DNA modification have been observed, such as single strand breaks (10Tomei D.L. Shapiro P.J. Cope O.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 853-857Google Scholar) or cleavage into large DNA fragments of 50–300 kilobase pairs (11Oberhammer F. Wilson W.T. Dive C. Morris D.I. Wakeling E.A. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3679-3684Google Scholar) (see also Table 1 in 9Bortner D.C. Oldenburg B.E.N. Cidlowski A.J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 5: 21-26Google Scholar). Evidence now suggests that DNA degradation could be a late, dispensable step in the apoptotic process, perhaps important in vivo for a safe elimination of apoptotic cells by the organism (12Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3037-3039Google Scholar, 13Oberhammer F. Bursch W. Tiefenbacher R. Froschl G. Pavelka M. Purchio T. Schulte-Hermann R.

Several nucleases have been invoked as responsible for apoptotic DNA degradation (15Peitsch M.C. Polzar B. Tschopp J. Mannherz H.G. Cell Death & Differ. 1994; 1: 1-6Google Scholar, 16Eastman A. Cell Death & Differ. 1994; 1: 7-9Google Scholar, 17Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski A.J. Cell Death & Differ. 1994; 1: 11-17Google Scholar), but their involvement in this process is supported only by indirect evidence. It is not clear yet whether it is always the same or there are different nucleases that participate in DNA fragmentation in different cell systems and in different apoptosis inducing conditions or whether this enzymatic activity results from the activation of a preexisting nuclease or from its de novo synthesis. Our present results deal with the observation that apoptosis in myoblast cells displays different degradation patterns correlated with the degree of cell differentiation. The possibility to modulate the pattern of apoptosis renders this cell system useful for the investigation of the pathways leading to DNA fragmentation. Mouse myoblast C2 cell clone 7 was obtained from Dr. M. Buckingham, Institute Pasteur, Paris, France; the subline expressing Polyomavirus large T (LT.N2) was derived from parental C2.7 myoblasts (18Maione R. Fimia G.M. Holman P. Schaffhausen B. Amati P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 231-237Google Scholar); embryonic fibroblasts C3H-10T1/2 expressing the myogenic determinant MyoD were kindly provided by Dr. M. Caruso (19Martelli F. Cenciarelli C. Santarelli G. Polikar B. Felsani A. Caruso M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3579-3590Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) 1The abbreviations used are: FCSfetal calf serumHShorse serumMHCeembryonic myosin heavy chainPBSphosphate-buffered salineDAPI4′,6′-diamine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochlorideMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidMHCmyosin heavy chain. (and under constant selection of 400 µg/ml geneticin (Sigma) in the case of N2 cell line and C3H-10T1/2-MyoD) in a humidified 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. Cells were passaged by standard trypsinization and seeded directly onto tissue culture plastic. To induce cell differentiation 3 × 103 cells/cm2 were seeded and grown to confluence in 20% FCS for 4 days and then were shifted to a lower serum concentration (0.5% FCS) or to a medium containing 10% horse serum (HS).

In the cases of induction of cell death with apoptotic agents, etoposide (0.1 µM) or puromycin (1 µg/ml) was added to proliferating cells or to differentiated cells kept 48 h in 10% HS medium. The induction of apoptosis was analyzed after 16 and 36 h of treatment. For determination of cell viability and chromatin condensation, ethidium bromide (4 µg/ml, Sigma) was added to the culture medium (20McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 153-185Google Scholar); the dye uptake by dead cells was instantaneous. Microscopic observation of cells was then performed, without fixation, under conditions of normal illumination or fluorescent light using a phase contrast inverted microscope. Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed by immersion in methanol/acetone (3:7, v/v) for 15 min at −20°C and then air dried. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mouse monoclonal anti-embryonic myosin heavy chain antibody (MHCe) MF20 (21Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Google Scholar) as undiluted hybridoma supernatant. After three washes with PBS, the coverslips were incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG rhodamine-conjugated IgG fraction (Cappel Immunochemicals) diluted 1:100 in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then washed repeatedly with PBS. A final stain of 10 min with 1 µg/ml DNA binding fluorochrome 4′,6′-diamine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Boehringer Mannheim) was carried out. The coverslips were washed and mounted with 70% glycerol in PBS. The samples were analyzed under phase contrast and appropriate fluorescent light. To examine nucleosome laddering, an equal number of cells was seeded as described before in 60-mm diameter culture dishes. At different times after starvation or induction of cell death with apoptotic agents, both attached and floating cells were collected, centrifuged, and washed with PBS (containing 5 mM MgCl2) twice. DNA was extracted as described in 22Bissonnette R.P. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 552-556Google Scholar. In brief, the pelleted cells were resuspended and disrupted in cold Tris/EDTA buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA) containing 0.5% Triton. The lysates were centrifuged for 20 min to separate fragmented DNA (soluble) from intact chromatin. At that point the samples were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 20 µg/ml RNase. Proteinase K was then added to the mixture adjusted to 100 µg/ml in 1% SDS and incubated for 3 h at 50°C. The DNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, using glycogen as coprecipitating agent. Pellets were air dried and resuspended in distilled water. Neutral agarose gels (1.5%) were prepared using multipurpose agarose according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA samples were prepared in a neutral loading buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol ff, and 30% glycerol in water), and the DNA samples were then added to the gel. Electrophoretic separation was performed at 100 V for 30–60 min. The DNA was visualized by UV illumination after ethidium bromide staining. Cells were assayed for expression of myosin by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cell lines by acidic guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction as described (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) at different times after serum starvation. Twenty µg of total RNA were loaded per lane and electrophoresed in formaldehyde/agarose gel in MOPS buffer. The gels were blotted on nylon filters (Hybond, Amersham Corp.) in 10 × SSC (saline sodium citrate) for 16–20 h, cross-linked, and prehybridized in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 0.5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h. [α-32P]dATP random primed cDNA probe generated from a PstI fragment of the plasmid MHCe 2.2 (24Weydert A. Daubas P. Lazaridis I. Barton P. Garner I. Leader D.P. Bonhomme F. Catalan J. Simon D. Guenet J.L. Gros F. Buckingham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7183-7187Google Scholar), specific for embryonic mouse myosin heavy chain transcript, was used for Northern blot analysis. To provide evidence that the RNA samples were not degraded and to normalize their amounts, the filter was rehybridized with a probe for the constitutively expressed gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (25Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Marty L. Dani C. Panabieres S. El Sabouti P. Fort P. Jeanteur P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6951-6953Google Scholar). The probe was hybridized to the immobilized RNA for 16–20 h at 42°C in the prehybridization buffer containing 500 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was washed (under high stringency conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions) four times. The first wash was with 2 × SSPE (sodium saline phosphate EDTA), 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42°C, then at 65°C for 30 min, and finally with 1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65°C. The last wash was with 0.2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature. In the course of our studies on C2 myoblast differentiation (18Maione R. Fimia G.M. Holman P. Schaffhausen B. Amati P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 231-237Google Scholar) we observed that the induction of differentiation by mitogen deprivation (0.2-0.5% FCS) was accompanied by some cell death showing many of the characteristics of apoptosis. In order to verify whether the observed cell death could be ascribed to an apoptotic phenomenon, confluent grown cells were deprived of mitogens and DNA fragmentation was analyzed for 4 consecutive days, until full myogenic differentiation was obtained. No typical ladder distribution of the DNA was observed until 48 h after lowering the serum concentration to 0.5% (Fig. 1a), although all other apoptotic characteristics may be observed from 12 h on (Fig. 1b). Thereafter, the internucleosomal degradation of DNA augmented until it reached the normal apoptotic DNA fragmentation. This increase went along with differentiation, as shown by the expression of the muscle-specific marker myosin heavy chain (MHC) (Fig. 1c). To better analyze the possible correlation between internucleosomal DNA degradation and the degree of differentiation of muscle cells, we treated C2 cells with apoptotic agents at different times after the induction of differentiation. Myoblast differentiation is dependent on the arrest of cell cycle (26Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Google Scholar), and this is generally obtained by removing growth factors from the medium. Contact inhibition, however, also contributes to the growth arrest so that confluent cultures can still differentiate in the presence of small amounts of mitogens. In this case differentiation was induced with 10% horse serum, a condition that does not cause cell death and still allows differentiation. As apoptotic agents we used the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (5Bertrand R. Kerrigan D. Saragan M. Pommier Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 77-85Google Scholar) or the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin (6Chow S.C. Peters I. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 149-159Google Scholar). Results reported in Fig. 2 show that treatment with both agents resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation only in cells previously kept in differentiation medium, despite the fact that the apoptotic phenotype was induced in both undifferentiated and differentiated cultures. A prolonged exposure (36 h) of proliferating myoblasts to apoptotic agents showed that oligonucleosomal fragmentation was completely absent and not simply delayed with respect to differentiated myoblast in which DNA ladder was already present after 16 h of treatment. The extensive cell death and the irreversible damage of cells undergoing apoptosis in the absence of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was confirmed by a strong reduction in their clonogenic potential; the plating efficiency (clonogenic survival) of etoposide-treated, undifferentiated cells was more than 10-fold lower with respect to that of untreated controls, after only 16 h of treatment (data not shown). These results show the correlation of DNA ladder formation with the degree of cell differentiation. In all cases in which apoptosis was induced in the absence of DNA ladder formation the DNA of dead cells appeared in a high molecular weight soluble form. In a previous work we have shown that C2 cells constitutively expressing the Polyomavirus large T oncogene were unable to terminally differentiate, despite their ability to perform some early steps of differentiation (18Maione R. Fimia G.M. Holman P. Schaffhausen B. Amati P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 231-237Google Scholar). Therefore, to further correlate the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation with muscle differentiation, LT.N2 cells were subjected to treatment with etoposide or puromycin in proliferating or differentiating conditions. The obtained results demonstrate that the inhibition of differentiation correlates with the absence of the DNA internucleosomal degradation (Fig. 3) in spite of the presence of apoptotic phenotype (data not shown). When differentiation is induced in low serum medium (0.2-0.5% FCS), LT.N2 cells undergo a consistent phenomenon of cell death, much more pronounced even than that observed in the parental C2 cell line; also in this case there is no trace of DNA ladder (data not shown). Again, the DNA of apoptotic LT.N2 cells appeared in a soluble form and at high molecular weight. C3H/10T1/2 cells were shown to undergo apoptosis in the absence of internucleosomal double-stranded DNA degradation (10Tomei D.L. Shapiro P.J. Cope O.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 853-857Google Scholar). These fibroblast cells can be converted to myoblast cells by the expression of the exogenous myogenic determinant MyoD (27Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Google Scholar). It therefore appears a suitable system for testing the correlation between the kind of DNA degradation and muscle differentiation. C3H/10T1/2 cells stably transfected with a MyoD expression vector (10TMyo) and their parental untransfected cells were analyzed for their ability to degrade internucleosomally their apoptotic DNA. Confluent grown cells were transferred to low serum medium, and at different intervals DNA degradation was determined. Results reported in Fig. 4a show that myogenic conversion confers to C3H/10T1/2 apoptotic cells the ability to degrade DNA internucleosomally upon induction of differentiation. The degree of myogenic differentiation was determined by muscle-specific gene expression. Furthermore, by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4b) we observed that the nuclei included in myotubes remain always intact and that the apoptotic nuclei are restricted to the differentiated mononucleated cells. In this report we have described how the induction of differentiation of cultured myoblast cells alters the pattern of apoptotic DNA degradation. Undifferentiated myoblasts, when treated with apoptosis-inducing agents, undergo cell death showing the typical apoptotic morphology, characterized by chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, but lack the typical internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. This finding is not surprising, since apoptosis in the absence of ladder distribution of degraded DNA has been already observed in other cell systems, mainly in epithelial and fibroblast cell lines (9Bortner D.C. Oldenburg B.E.N. Cidlowski A.J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 5: 21-26Google Scholar). Our finding, therefore, supports the hypothesis that the changes in nuclear morphology occurring during apoptosis are not dependent on a previously activated internucleosomal DNase activity. The high molecular weight, soluble DNA extracted from undifferentiated apoptotic myoblasts is likely to correspond to the large DNA fragments of 50–300 kilobase pairs, described as an early event in many forms of apoptosis (11Oberhammer F. Wilson W.T. Dive C. Morris D.I. Wakeling E.A. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3679-3684Google Scholar, 14Cohen G.M. Sun X.M. Snowden R.T. Dinsdale D. Skilleter D.N. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 331-334Google Scholar) and probably correlated with the size of chromatin loop domains. After the induction of differentiation, myoblast cells acquire the ability to degrade their DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments. The correlation between myogenic differentiation and such an endonucleolytic activity is strongly supported by the effect of myogenic conversion of C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells by MyoD expression. Apoptotic DNA from C3H10T1/2 is not degraded in oligonucleosomal form (10Tomei D.L. Shapiro P.J. Cope O.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 853-857Google Scholar) whereas its myogenic derivative (10TMyo), if induced to differentiate, displays a ladder distribution of its DNA. Moreover, Polyomavirus large T oncogene-transformed myoblasts, inhibited in the myogenic program, lose the ability to activate the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, differentiated apoptotic cells, from both C2 and 10TMyo cell lines, have been found to be mononucleated. This observation could probably reflect that apoptotic DNA fragmentation occurs in a differentiative stage preceding the fusion into myotubes where nuclei are protected from apoptosis. This finding is consistent with the view that apoptosis represents a mechanism to eliminate cells that do not perform correctly their differentiative program. The ability of differentiated cells to degrade their DNA into small fragments could reflect a modification in the level or in the activity of a nuclease or, alternatively, a modification in the chromatin structure that allows the access of some nuclease to the DNA. Nuclear extracts from both differentiated and undifferentiated myoblasts contain a high nuclease activity migrating with an 18-kDa molecular mass, as we determined by the gel nuclease assay used by Gaido and Cidlowski (28Gaido M.L. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18580-18585Google Scholar) to identify the nuclease NUC 18 from apoptotic thymocytes (data not shown). This result excludes only the possibility of myoblast differentiation being associated with an increased level of this nuclease, leaving open all possible activity modifications including a different availability of the substrate. A more detailed biochemical analysis is necessary to clarify this issue. Apoptosis in muscle cells has not been previously described, and the role of programmed cell death in muscle development has not been defined (the behavior of C2 myoblasts could be a particular characteristic of an immortal cell line). However, in the past decades, consistent phenomena of cell death have been observed during the development of many tissues, included myotome and embryonic muscle (29Glucksmann A. Biol. Rev. 1951; 26: 59-86Google Scholar). The acquisition of the ability, by muscle cells, to perform the ultimate step of apoptosis, which may be necessary in particular physiological contexts, could reflect a possible role for this process during in vivo differentiation. We are indebted to Prof. Paolo Amati for continuous support during the development of this work and for help in discussing and writing the manuscript."

G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) is a 20-kDa, helical glycoprotein cytokine, and it belongs to the hemopoietic growth factor family (2Nagata S. Thomson A.W.

G-CSF binds to its specific receptor and stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophilic progenitor cells. The G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) is a type I membrane protein belonging to the hemopoietic growth factor receptor family (3Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Harada N. Yokota T. Arai K. Annu. Rev.

Most members of the hemopoietic growth factor receptor family consist of two different subunits, and a heterodimer binds the cognate ligand with high affinity, thus transducing the signal. G-CSFR, the receptors for erythropoietin and growth hormone are made of a single polypeptide, and the ligand seems to induce homodimerizaton of the receptor, which transduces the signal (2Nagata S. Thomson A.W. The Cytokine Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London1994: 371Google Scholar). Exogenous expression of G-CSFR in an IL-3-dependent myeloid precursor such as FDC-P1 makes the cells respond to G-CSF by proliferation (5Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of G-CSFR have indicated that a domain of about 200 amino acids in the extracellular region of G-CSFR, which shows a similarity with other hemopoietic growth factor receptors, is the G-CSF binding site (5Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).Fas, also called APO-1 or CD95, is a 45-kDa type I membrane protein expressed in various tissues and cells and belongs to the TNF/nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor family (6Itoh N.

This family is comprised of TNF receptors (type I, β or 55 kDa; type II, α or 75 kDa), low affinity NGF receptor, the B cell antigen CD40, as well as the T cell antigens CD27, CD30, OX40, and 4-1BB. Most ligands of the TNF/NGF receptor family belong to the TNF family, which includes TNF, lymphotoxin, Fas ligand (FasL), CD40 ligand, etc. (8Nagata S. Golstein P.

FasL is synthesized as a type II membrane protein with a molecular mass of 40 kDa (11Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar), and under certain conditions, a trimeric soluble form of FasL is produced by proteolytic cleavage (12Tanaka M.

The membrane-bound form of FasL, the soluble form of human FasL, or the agonistic antibodies against Fas induce apoptosis by binding to Fas in Fas-bearing cells (6Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A.

Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this study, we constructed hybrids between G-CSFR and Fas, which belong to different cytokine receptor families (hemopoietic growth factor and TNF/NGF receptor families). The chimeric receptor carrying the cytoplasmic region of G-CSFR transduced the growth signal, whereas that carrying the Fas cytoplasmic region transduced the apoptotic signal when they dimerized or oligomerized, respectively. These results indicated that the role of the ligand is just to induce dimerization or oligomerization of the respective receptors to activate them.DISCUSSIONA single transmembrane region of the cytokine receptor divides the molecule into the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions. The receptor activation due to extracellular ligand binding therefore should be transferred across the membrane barrier to activate the cytoplasmic signal-transducing domain of the receptor. In cytokine receptors containing the tyrosine-kinase domain, the ligand induces dimerization of the receptor, and molecular interaction of the adjacent cytoplasmic domains leads to activation of the kinase (27Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 28Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Among the hemopoietic growth factor receptors, receptors for G-CSF and growth hormone as a homodimer bind the respective ligand with high affinity (29Nagata S. Fukunaga R. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The structural analysis of the complex between growth hormone and its receptor indicated that a single molecule of growth hormone bridges two receptor molecules to induce its dimerization (30de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Since G-CSF and growth hormone have a similar tertiary structure (31Hill C.P. Osslund T.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), G-CSF also seems to induce dimerization of the receptor to activate. Here we have shown that binding of polyclonal anti-G-CSFR antibody to G-CSFR activated the G-CSF cytoplasmic region to transduce the growth signal. Furthermore, binding of FasL to a chimera consisting of the Fas extracellular and G-CSFR cytoplasmic regions also activated the chimeric receptor for the growth signal. The G-CSFR antibody is polyvalent, and FasL is a trimer (12Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor by these molecules suggested that not only dimeric but also the trimeric or oligomeric structure of the G-CSFR can transduce the signal (Fig. 6).TNF-α and TNF-β have a trimeric structure (32Eck M.J. Ultsch M. Rinderknecht E. de Vos A.M. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2119-2122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol.

X-ray analysis indicated that a TNF-β trimer makes a complex with three molecules of the extracellular region of the TNF receptor (35Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), suggesting that TNF induces trimerization of the receptor to transduce the signal. However, it was not clear whether the bringing together of only two receptor molecules would be sufficient for signal transduction. FasL is a member of the TNF family (11Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar) and exists as a trimer (12Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that G-CSF, which induces dimerization of G-CSFR, could not activate the Fas cytoplasmic region in the chimera consisting of the G-CSFR extracellular and Fas cytoplasmic regions, whereas polyvalent anti-G-CSFR antibody activated the Fas cytoplasmic region of the chimera and killed the cell. These results indicated that dimerization of Fas cytoplasmic region is not sufficient to transduce the signal, and it should be oligomerized (probably, trimerized) to cause apoptosis. Previously, Dhein et al. (36Dhein J. Daniel P.T. Trauth B.C. Oehm A. Möller P. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3166-3173PubMed Google Scholar) observed that the F(ab)2 fragment of the monoclonal anti-APO-1 antibody recognizing Fas did not cause apoptosis, but it induced apoptosis if they were cross-linked with the anti-F(ab)2 antibody (36Dhein J. Daniel P.T. Trauth B.C. Oehm A. Möller P. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3166-3173PubMed Google Scholar). Several groups have recently isolated Fas-associated cytoplasmic proteins (FADD/MORT1, RIP) by the yeast two-hybrid system (37Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D.

Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar), and one of them (FADD/MORT1) was found to bind Fas after its oligomerization (40Kischkel F. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P. Peter M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). These findings agree with the notion that an oligomer (probably trimer) but not a dimer of Fas can transduce the signal. In hemopoietic growth factor receptors that work as a dimer, the signal transducers such as JAK kinases and STAT proteins also work as dimers (hetero- or homodimer) (41Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 42Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). In this regard, it would be interesting to examine whether the signal transducers of Fas-mediated apoptosis in the cytoplasm work also as a trimer.We showed that the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions of the different cytokine receptor families can be functionally exchanged. There are many orphan receptors of which ligands have not been identified. The successful swapping between members of the different receptor families suggests that a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular region of the orphan receptor and the cytoplasmic region of the known receptor can be used to identify the respective ligand. Specifically, the G-CSFR cytoplasmic region would be a good system since several IL-3-dependent cell lines such as FDC-P1 and BAF-B03 are strictly dependent on the signal from G-CSFR for their growth (5Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). By exchanging the extracellular region of G-CSFR and Fas, we have generated a death factor receptor that transduces the growth signal in response to the death factor. It will be possible to generate transgenic mice carrying such chimeric receptors using the gene-targeting strategy. In these mice, the cells that should die in response to the death factor would now grow. In the reverse orientation, it may be also possible to produce transgenic mice in which specific cells responding to a certain growth factor are killed by the growth factor. Such transgenic mice may be useful to study the function of specific cells in mammalian development.

The chimeric receptor carrying the cytoplasmic region of G-CSFR transduced the growth signal, whereas that carrying the Fas cytoplasmic region transduced the apoptotic signal when they dimerized or oligomerized, respectively. These results indicated that the role of the ligand is just to induce dimerization or oligomerization of the respective receptors to activate them. Cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are regulated by protein factors, collectively called cytokine(s). Cytokines are grouped into at least three subfamilies based on structure, cystine knot growth factors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorCSFcolony-stimulating factorG-CSFgranulocyte colony-stimulating factorG-CSFRG-CSF receptorILinterleukinNGFnerve growth factorFasLFas ligandPCRpolymerase chain reactionCRHcytokine receptor-homologousCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. and helical cytokines (1Davies D.R.

G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) is a 20-kDa, helical glycoprotein cytokine, and it belongs to the hemopoietic growth factor family (2Nagata S. Thomson A.W. The Cytokine Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London1994: 371Google Scholar). G-CSF binds to its specific receptor and stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophilic progenitor cells. The G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) is a type I membrane protein belonging to the hemopoietic growth factor receptor family (3Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Harada N. Yokota T. Arai K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 295-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 4Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar), which includes the receptors for interleukins (ILs), colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), and growth hormone. Most members of the hemopoietic growth factor receptor family consist of two different subunits, and a heterodimer binds the cognate ligand with high affinity, thus transducing the signal. G-CSFR, the receptors for erythropoietin and growth hormone are made of a single polypeptide, and the ligand seems to induce homodimerizaton of the receptor, which transduces the signal (2Nagata S. Thomson A.W. The Cytokine Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London1994: 371Google Scholar). Exogenous expression of G-CSFR in an IL-3-dependent myeloid precursor such as FDC-P1 makes the cells respond to G-CSF by proliferation (5Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S.

These results indicated that the role of the ligand is just to induce dimerization or oligomerization of the respective receptors to activate them. DISCUSSIONA single transmembrane region of the cytokine receptor divides the molecule into the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions. The receptor activation due to extracellular ligand binding therefore should be transferred across the membrane barrier to activate the cytoplasmic signal-transducing domain of the receptor. In cytokine receptors containing the tyrosine-kinase domain, the ligand induces dimerization of the receptor, and molecular interaction of the adjacent cytoplasmic domains leads to activation of the kinase (27Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 28Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Among the hemopoietic growth factor receptors, receptors for G-CSF and growth hormone as a homodimer bind the respective ligand with high affinity (29Nagata S. Fukunaga R. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The structural analysis of the complex between growth hormone and its receptor indicated that a single molecule of growth hormone bridges two receptor molecules to induce its dimerization (30de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Since G-CSF and growth hormone have a similar tertiary structure (31Hill C.P. Osslund T.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), G-CSF also seems to induce dimerization of the receptor to activate. Here we have shown that binding of polyclonal anti-G-CSFR antibody to G-CSFR activated the G-CSF cytoplasmic region to transduce the growth signal. Furthermore, binding of FasL to a chimera consisting of the Fas extracellular and G-CSFR cytoplasmic regions also activated the chimeric receptor for the growth signal. The G-CSFR antibody is polyvalent, and FasL is a trimer (12Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor by these molecules suggested that not only dimeric but also the trimeric or oligomeric structure of the G-CSFR can transduce the signal (Fig. 6).TNF-α and TNF-β have a trimeric structure (32Eck M.J. Ultsch M. Rinderknecht E. de Vos A.M. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2119-2122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol.

X-ray analysis indicated that a TNF-β trimer makes a complex with three molecules of the extracellular region of the TNF receptor (35Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), suggesting that TNF induces trimerization of the receptor to transduce the signal. However, it was not clear whether the bringing together of only two receptor molecules would be sufficient for signal transduction. FasL is a member of the TNF family (11Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar) and exists as a trimer (12Tanaka M. Suda T. Takahashi T. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that G-CSF, which induces dimerization of G-CSFR, could not activate the Fas cytoplasmic region in the chimera consisting of the G-CSFR extracellular and Fas cytoplasmic regions, whereas polyvalent anti-G-CSFR antibody activated the Fas cytoplasmic region of the chimera and killed the cell. These results indicated that dimerization of Fas cytoplasmic region is not sufficient to transduce the signal, and it should be oligomerized (probably, trimerized) to cause apoptosis. Previously, Dhein et al. (36Dhein J. Daniel P.T. Trauth B.C. Oehm A. Möller P. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3166-3173PubMed Google Scholar) observed that the F(ab)2 fragment of the monoclonal anti-APO-1 antibody recognizing Fas did not cause apoptosis, but it induced apoptosis if they were cross-linked with the anti-F(ab)2 antibody (36Dhein J. Daniel P.T. Trauth B.C. Oehm A. Möller P. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3166-3173PubMed Google Scholar). Several groups have recently isolated Fas-associated cytoplasmic proteins (FADD/MORT1, RIP) by the yeast two-hybrid system (37Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D.

Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar), and one of them (FADD/MORT1) was found to bind Fas after its oligomerization (40Kischkel F. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P. Peter M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). These findings agree with the notion that an oligomer (probably trimer) but not a dimer of Fas can transduce the signal. In hemopoietic growth factor receptors that work as a dimer, the signal transducers such as JAK kinases and STAT proteins also work as dimers (hetero- or homodimer) (41Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 42Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). In this regard, it would be interesting to examine whether the signal transducers of Fas-mediated apoptosis in the cytoplasm work also as a trimer.We showed that the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions of the different cytokine receptor families can be functionally exchanged. There are many orphan receptors of which ligands have not been identified. The successful swapping between members of the different receptor families suggests that a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular region of the orphan receptor and the cytoplasmic region of the known receptor can be used to identify the respective ligand. Specifically, the G-CSFR cytoplasmic region would be a good system since several IL-3-dependent cell lines such as FDC-P1 and BAF-B03 are strictly dependent on the signal from G-CSFR for their growth (5Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). By exchanging the extracellular region of G-CSFR and Fas, we have generated a death factor receptor that transduces the growth signal in response to the death factor. It will be possible to generate transgenic mice carrying such chimeric receptors using the gene-targeting strategy. In these mice, the cells that should die in response to the death factor would now grow. In the reverse orientation, it may be also possible to produce transgenic mice in which specific cells responding to a certain growth factor are killed by the growth factor. Such transgenic mice may be useful to study the function of specific cells in mammalian development. A single transmembrane region of the cytokine receptor divides the molecule into the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions. The receptor activation due to extracellular ligand binding therefore should be transferred across the membrane barrier to activate the cytoplasmic signal-transducing domain of the receptor. In cytokine receptors containing the tyrosine-kinase domain, the ligand induces dimerization of the receptor, and molecular interaction of the adjacent cytoplasmic domains leads to activation of the kinase (27Schlessinger J.

It will be possible to generate transgenic mice carrying such chimeric receptors using the gene-targeting strategy. In these mice, the cells that should die in response to the death factor would now grow. In the reverse orientation, it may be also possible to produce transgenic mice in which specific cells responding to a certain growth factor are killed by the growth factor. Such transgenic mice may be useful to study the function of specific cells in mammalian development. -We thank Dr. T. M. Dexter for FDC-P1 cells and K. Enari for secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2091870640,"L-Lactate monooxygenase (LMO) from Mycobacterium smegmatis was mutated at glycine 99 to alanine, and the properties of the resulting mutant (referred to as G99A) were studied. Mutant G99A of LMO was designed to test the postulate that the smaller glycine residue in the vicinity of the α-carbon methyl group of lactate in wild-type LMO has less steric hindrance, leading to the retention and oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate in the active site, a unique property of LMO in contrast to other members of the FMN-dependent oxidase/dehydrogenase family. G99A has been shown to be readily reduced by L-lactate at a rate similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The binding of pyruvate to reduced G99A is 4-fold weaker than that to the wild-type enzyme. A dramatic change of this mutation is that G99A has a much lower oxygen reactivity than the wild-type enzyme. Pyruvate-bound reduced G99A reacts with O2 at a rate ∼105-fold slower than the wild-type enzyme, and free reduced G99A reacts with O2 at a rate ∼100-fold slower than the wild-type enzyme. Due to the very low oxygen reactivity of the pyruvate-bound reduced enzyme, G99A has been shown to catalyze the oxidation of L-lactate to pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide instead of acetate, carbon dioxide, and water, the normal decarboxylation products of pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the mutation alters the enzyme from its L-lactate monooxygenase activity to L-lactate oxidase activity. However, compared with L-lactate oxidase, G99A has a much lower reactivity toward oxygen. Our results also reveal that the small steric change around N-5 of the flavin causes a profound change in the electronic distribution in the catalytic cavity of the enzyme and imply that electrostatic interactions in the active site provide an important factor for control of O2 reactivity.

L-Lactate monooxygenase (LMO 1The abbreviations used are: LMOL-lactate monooxygenaseHRPhorseradish peroxidase. ; EC) catalyzes the oxidation of L-lactate to acetate, carbon dioxide, and water with the incorporation of molecular oxygen into acetate and water (1Hayaishi O.

The physiological role of LMO in the mycobacterial species is unknown. However, the enzyme has been purified in good yields from Mycobacterium smegmatis. The gene of the protein has been subsequently cloned, expressed, and purified from Escherichia coli (3Giegel D.A. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6626-6632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Müh U. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LMO was found to be an octamer with identical subunits containing one FMN on each subunit (5Sullivan P.A. Choong Y.S. Schreurs W.J. Cutfield J.F. Shepherd M.G. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of each monomer is ∼43 kDa with 393 amino acid residues (3Giegel D.A. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6626-6632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LMO is a member of a family of FMN-dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of L-α-hydroxy acids, including L-lactate oxidase (6Maeda-Yorita K. Aki K. Sagai H. Misaki H. Massey V. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), lactate dehydrogenase (flavocytochrome b2) (7Lederer F. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 153Google Scholar), glycolate oxidase (8Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 20877-20881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of L-lactate monooxygenase has been intensively studied (12Ghisla S. Massey V. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 243Google Scholar). It has been shown that, within this family, L-lactate monooxygenase is unique in forming a ternary complex (EFlox-pyr-H2O2 as shown in Fig. 1) that results in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. The reaction scheme is depicted as the inner pathway (or coupled pathway) in Fig. 1 with acetate, carbon dioxide, and water as the reaction products. Fig. 1 also shows the reactions catalyzed by the other enzymes as the outer pathway (or uncoupled pathway) with the reaction products of pyruvate and H2O2. The unique property of LMO within the family to follow the coupled pathway has been traced to the fact that pyruvate dissociates slowly from reduced LMO, and the complex reacts rapidly with oxygen before pyruvate dissociates from the enzyme. A difficulty of the study of L-lactate monooxygenase arises from the lack of a crystal structure. However, the crystal structures of flavocytochrome b2 and glycolate oxidase have been solved (8Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3624-3628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Xia Z.X. Mattews S.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 837-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 14Xia Z.X. Shamala N.

The two enzymes show a strong similarity in the folding pattern around the flavin. Based on the fact that there is strong homology in the amino acid sequences within the family and that the six amino acid residues involved in substrate binding and the reaction mechanism are highly conserved (3Giegel D.A. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6626-6632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Maeda-Yorita K. Aki K. Sagai H. Misaki H. Massey V.

Cortial S. Becam A.H. Hanmout P.Y. Perez L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a basic assumption has been made that the three-dimensional structures of the family of enzymes are similar and that the substrates bind similarly with respect to FMN and the active-site residues. It is believed that all enzymes in this family have a common initialization of reactions, the abstraction of a proton from the α-carbon of the substrate by a histidine residue (for reviews, see 7Lederer F. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 153Google Scholar and 12Ghisla S. Massey V. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 243Google Scholar). The protonated histidine is stabilized by a nearby aspartate residue. The resulting carbanion is then proposed to attack FMN at N-5. The anionic form of the flavin could be stabilized by a lysine residue that is close to N-1 of the flavin. There are also two tyrosine residues and one arginine residue that are postulated to be involved in substrate binding as shown in Fig. 2. Based on the crystal structure studies and reactions with 5-deaza-8-hydroxy-FMN-substituted LMO (18Manstein D.J. Massey V. Ghisla S. Pai E.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2300-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Manstein D.J. Pai E.F. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6807-6816Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), substrates of this family of flavoenzymes have been shown to bind on the si-face of the flavin. The size of the fourth substituent of the substrate α-carbon varies considerably within this family. The fact that flavocytochrome b2, lactate oxidase, and lactate monooxygenase work differently with the common substrate, L-lactate, strongly suggests that some structural differences exist in this group of enzymes. Crystal studies show that the residue directly extending toward the methyl group of lactate, on the re-face of the flavin, is an alanine in flavocytochrome b2 and in glycolate oxidase. The analogous residue in lactate oxidase is also an alanine, but it is Gly-99 in LMO (Fig. 2). It is possible that the smaller glycine residue in LMO has a greater steric tolerance around flavin N-5 than the larger alanine residue in the other family members and therefore may be responsible for the slow release of pyruvate from the reduced enzyme. In this study, Gly-99 has been replaced with an alanine in L-lactate monooxygenase, and the mutant enzyme is referred to as G99A. The larger residue is expected to have a greater steric hindrance, which might force the substrate to bind abnormally and convert the monooxygenase activity to oxidase activity, as in lactate oxidase. Oligodeoxynucleotide was synthesized with an Applied Biosystems model 380A DNA synthesizer by the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Center at the University of Michigan. The mutagenesis reaction was done by using the Amersham mutagenesis kit (or the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system). The restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs Inc. Yeast extract and Tryptone extract were from Difco or Life Technologies, Inc. Q-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Sephadex G-25, imidazole, L-lactate (lithium salt), D-lactate (lithium salt), pyruvate (sodium salt), oxalate (dilithium salt), glycine, methyl methanethiosulfonate, o-dianisidine·2HCl (3,3′-dimethoxybenzidine dihydrochloride), 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were from Sigma. The A403/A280 ratio of the HRP solution was 3.4. Catalase from bovine liver was obtained from Calbiochem. The 5-deazaflavin used in photochemical studies was as described previously (20Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). DL-2-Hydroxy-3-butynoic acid was a gift from Dr. Sandro Ghisla (University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany). Cells were harvested with a Beckman centrifuge. A Branson sonicator was used for lysing the cell suspension in a Branson rosette cell (500 ml) chilled on ice. Chromatography was performed on a Waters fast protein liquid chromatograph (model 650E, Millipore Corp.). Spectroscopic determinations of dissociation constants and absorbance spectra were carried out with Cary model 3 and model 219 recording spectrophotometers or with a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrophotometer (model 8452A). Excitation and emission spectra were recorded with a spectrofluorometer built by Dr. D. P. Ballou and G. Ford at the University of Michigan. Rapid reaction studies were performed with a Hi-Tech stopped-flow apparatus. The experimental data were analyzed by a computer program called Program A, which was developed by Dr. D. P. Ballou, Chung-Jen Chiu, Rong Chang, and Joel Dinverno (University of Michigan). The program permits the analysis of experimental data by exponential fits based on the Marquardt algorithm (21Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1969: 235Google Scholar). All stopped-flow experiments were carried out at least three times, and the average data are presented in this paper. The variations of the data for each set of conditions was <5%. A Clark-type oxygen electrode and a Yellow Springs oxygen monitor (model 53) were used to monitor oxygen consumption during turnover. All experiments were carried out at 25°C, unless otherwise indicated, and light was excluded from the reaction solutions as much as possible because LMO is very susceptible to light, forming the semiquinone species. The vectors used for generating G99A of lactate monooxygenase and the expression plasmid were as described previously (4Müh U. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutagenesis of glycine 99 (codon GGG) was performed with the oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTCCCATCGTCATA*GCGCTGTGCG-3′ (the codon for alanine is underlined). A silent mutation at isoleucine 101 (marked with an asterisk) was also introduced in order to create an Eco47III site (5′-AGCGCT-3′). Successful mutagenesis was thereby screened for the addition of the Eco47III site. The NcoI-MunI fragment (321 base pairs) was ligated into the appropriate position of the expression plasmid pUM01. Successful insertion was confirmed by digesting with Eco47III and finally by plasmid sequencing. G99A was grown in 6 × 1 liter of Terrific Broth and purified as described previously (4Müh U. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, the wet weight of cells was ∼30-35 g. The majority of the mutant was found in an insoluble form. Only the soluble fraction was isolated and purified. The purity of the protein was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207460) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Blue. The extinction coefficient for G99A was determined by denaturing the protein with SDS. A 10-µl aliquot of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to 1 ml of enzyme solution in 10 mM imidazole HCl buffer, pH 7.0, at 25°C. The extinction coefficient for the flavin bound to lactate monooxygenase was determined based on the amount of released FMN. The concentration of free FMN was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 12,500 M−1 cm−1 at 445 nm. The extinction coefficient of the enzyme-bound flavin of LMO has been reported to be very dependent on the nature of the buffer (2Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8097-8106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sullivan P.A. Choong Y.S. Schreurs W.J. Cutfield J.F. Shepherd M.G. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, all the experiments in this work were carried out in 10 mM imidazole buffer, pH 7.0, unless otherwise indicated. The stopped-flow syringes were filled overnight with a mixture of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate dioxygenase to scrub oxygen. For the stopped-flow experiment, one syringe was filled with oxidized G99A (∼10 µM), which was made anaerobic by alternate cycles of evacuation and filling with oxygen-free argon in a tonometer. Another syringe was filled with anaerobic L-lactate at concentrations from 2.5 to 200 mM. The L-lactate was made anaerobic by bubbling with oxygen-free argon for 20 min. The reduction of enzyme-bound flavin was followed by the absorbance decrease at 460 nm. Fully reduced G99A (∼20 µM) was made by the addition of 1 eq of L-lactate from the side arm of an anaerobic cuvette attached to a tonometer. The stopped-flow experiment was performed with one syringe filled with reduced G99A and the other syringe filled with 10 mM imidazole buffer, which was bubbled with varied oxygen concentrations for 20 min. The reaction was followed by the reoxidation of flavin at 460 nm. For the oxidation of pyruvate-bound reduced G99A by oxygen, free reduced G99A was kept in one syringe, and the other syringe was filled with 50 mM pyruvate and varied oxygen concentrations. The reaction was followed by the absorbance increase at 460 nm. The reactivity of G99A (∼15.7 µM) with DL-2-hydroxy-3-butynoic acid (23Walsh C. Schonbrunn A. Lockridge O. Massey V. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6004-6006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ghisla S. Ogata H. Massey V. Schonbrunn A. Abeles R.H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was tested by tipping in the inhibitor from the side arm of an anaerobic cuvette to a final concentration of 6.6 mM. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically with time. Lactate monooxygenase was reduced photochemically by the method described previously (20Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 25Massey V. Hemmerich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5612-5614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycine was used as photoreductant instead of EDTA since EDTA photochemically breaks down to glyoxalate, which is a substrate for lactate monooxygenase (26Massey V. Ghisla S. Kieschke K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2796-2806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme in 0.1 M glycine solution was treated with alternate cycles of evacuation and oxygen-free argon in an anaerobic cuvette in the dark. Once the solution was made anaerobic, 5-deazaflavin was tipped in from the side arm to a final concentration of 1 µM. Full semiquinone was obtained by light irradiation with visible light from a sun gun for ∼10 min. The thermodynamic stability of the semiquinone was tested by the addition of benzyl viologen (1 µM final concentration), which acts as a mediator between the flavin semiquinone in the octameric protein. The spectra of the mixture were followed for 24 h. Enzyme at the flavin semiquinone level was prepared by photoreduction of the oxidized enzyme as described above and put into one syringe of the stopped-flow apparatus. The other syringe was filled with buffer that had been bubbled with varied oxygen concentrations for 20 min. The reaction was followed by both the absorbance decrease at 400 nm and the absorbance increase at 460 nm. A large excess of pyruvate (∼10 mM) was mixed with enzyme semiquinone (∼30 µM) from the side arm of an anaerobic cuvette. On opening to air, the mixture was quickly loaded on a Sephadex G-25 column at 4°C. Semiquinone-pyruvate complex free of excess pyruvate was thereby obtained in the same way as described previously for the wild-type enzyme (27Choong Y.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8672-8677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solution was equilibrated to 25°C, and the stability of the complex to air was followed spectrophotometrically with time. Enzyme turnover was determined by oxygen consumption measurements with an oxygen electrode. At air saturation, varied concentrations of L-lactate from 5 to 150 mM were used. The reaction was initiated by the addition of G99A to a final concentration as high as 40 µM in order to obtain accurate measurements. When catalase was used in the measurements, it was added to the solution before the addition of G99A. The turnover numbers were calculated from the tangents to the initial portion of the traces. H2O2 formation was measured colorimetrically by the oxidation of o-dianisidine in the presence of horseradish peroxidase. Typically, 1.0-ml samples containing buffer, 0.4 mM o-dianisidine, 0.1 µM HRP, and various concentrations of L-lactate were used, and the reaction was followed at 460 nm after the addition of enzyme. The extinction coefficient of the oxidized o-dianisidine at 460 nm is 1.16 × 104M−1 cm−1 (2Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8097-8106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pyruvate formation was followed spectrophotometrically by the formation of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative (28Walsh C.T. Schonbrunn A. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6855-6896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of hydrogen peroxide was also determined indirectly by the formation of HRP compound I (HRP-I) at varied oxygen concentrations by stopped-flow experiments. A mixture of 1 µM G99A and 8 µM HRP at air saturation was placed in one syringe of the stopped-flow apparatus. The other syringe was filled with varied oxygen concentrations and L-lactate at concentrations of 9.7, 19.4, 49.7, and 200 mM. The reaction was followed at 398 nm, which is the isosbestic point of HRP-I and HRP-II. The extinction difference of native HRP and HRP-I at 398 nm is 4.35 × 104M−1 cm−1 (29Dunford H.B. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Advances in Inorganic Biochemistry. Elsevier Biomedical, New York1982: 41Google Scholar). Pure G99A did not show normal flavin absorbance characteristics in the 370 nm region, having an A280/A456 ratio of ∼16, which is higher than the usual value of ∼9.5 for the wild-type enzyme and other mutants (4Müh U. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Müh U. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7989-7993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Müh U. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7994-8000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon addition of an excess of methyl methanethiosulfonate, the flavin absorbance was observed to increase with time as shown in Fig. 3. The reaction mixture shows a final absorption spectrum similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The plot of A460 versus time yields a t1/2 of 44 min for this reaction. A similar phenomenon has been observed previously with the R293K mutant (32Müh U. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1994: 201Google Scholar). As with that mutant, it is concluded that the G99A enzyme contains a mixture of a flavin N(5)-cysteine adduct and the normal flavin enzyme free thiol. Methyl methanethiosulfonate reacts with the equilibrium concentration of free thiol, and by doing so displaces the equilibrium to abolish completely the N-5 adduct. To remove the adduct, an ∼10-fold excess of L-lactate was used to reduce the enzyme under anaerobic conditions. Following reduction, there was a slow increase in absorbance in the 360 nm region, with a t1/2 of ∼50 min. Thus, as expected, reduction shifts the equilibrium between the normal flavin and the N(5)-cysteine adduct, and eventually, ∼100% of the normal flavin enzyme was obtained. The excess L-lactate and keto acid were removed by gel filtration with Sephadex G-25. Such enzyme could be stored at 4°C for 1 month without re-formation of the adduct. Typically, ∼25 mg of G99A was isolated from 6 liters of bacterial growth, compared with ∼66 mg of wild-type enzyme. After treatment and gel filtration, the oxidized enzyme shows absorbance peaks at 457 and 370 nm as shown in Fig. 4. The ratio A280/A456 has decreased to 9.6, and the spectrum resembles that of the wild-type enzyme. The extinction coefficient at 456 nm was determined to be 11,360 M−1 cm−1. Like the wild-type enzyme, the oxidized enzyme is nonfluorescent, but becomes fluorescent upon reduction. The reduced enzyme shows maximum excitation at 365 nm and maximum emission at 510 nm, similar to the wild-type enzyme (33Ghisla S. Massey V. Lhoste J.M. Mayhew S.G. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The presence of phosphate and chloride ions does not show any effect on the absorption spectrum of oxidized G99A (data not shown), which is in contrast with the wild-type enzyme (2Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8097-8106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As was found with the wild-type enzyme (2Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8097-8106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a charge transfer complex is formed between the reduced enzyme and pyruvate, characterized by an absorbance band extending out to 600 nm. The dissociation constant for the reduced G99A-pyruvate complex was determined to be 11.5 mM by following the absorbance increase at 540 nm as a function of pyruvate concentration. The Kd for the wild-type enzyme under the same conditions is 2.5 mM (2Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8097-8106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, pyruvate binds to reduced G99A ∼4-fold weaker than to the wild-type enzyme. Under anaerobic conditions, the enzyme was reduced rapidly by L-lactate. The reaction was monitored by the flavin absorbance decrease at 460 nm with time. Fig. 5 shows a series of time traces at 460 nm at varied L-lactate concentrations. The reaction is biphasic, and it is clear that the first phase is L-lactate concentration-dependent and that the second phase is independent of L-lactate concentration. The kinetic measurements yield the reduction rate of G99A by L-lactate to be 13,000 min−1, as shown in Fig. 5 (inset). From this kinetic saturation curve, the apparent dissociation constant for binding of L-lactate to G99A was estimated to be 30 mM (34Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with the 50 mM dissociation constant for the wild-type enzyme (2Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8097-8106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), L-lactate binds to G99A tighter than to the wild-type enzyme, even though the binding is still weak (Table I).Table I.Comparison of the values of wild-type LMO and mutant G99A (in 10&mM imidazole HCl, pH 7.0,&at 25&°C)LMOWild-typeG99ADissociation constantsL-Lactate (M)5.0&×&10−23.0&×&10−2D-Lactate (M)1.7&×&10−31.7&×&10−3Oxalate (M)1.6&×&10−533&×&10−5Pyruvate to EredaEred, reduced enzyme; SQ, enzyme semiquinone; ND, not determined.(M)2.5&×&10−311.5&×&10−3Pyruvate to SQ (M)1.4&×&10−52.0&×&10−5Kinetic constantsk2 (min−1)14,00013,000k3 (min−1)2.54.7k−3 (M−1 min−1)1034.1&×&102k4 (M−1 min−1)1.1&×&1081.3&×&103k5 (min−1)11,300NDk6 (M−1 min−1)5.4&×&1055.1&×&103a Ered, reduced enzyme; SQ, enzyme semiquinone; ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The second phase of the stopped-flow traces yields the rate constant of pyruvate release from the reduced enzyme. The average value of 4.7 min−1 was obtained, independent of the concentration of L-lactate. Compared with 2.5 min−1 for the wild-type enzyme, the mutation thus shows a 2-fold faster release of pyruvate from the reduced enzyme. Oxalate has been used as an analog of the presumed carbanion transition state of the reductive half-reaction. The binding of oxalate to the enzyme induces a pronounced perturbation of the absorption spectrum of the oxidized enzyme (35Ghisla S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference spectrum between the uncomplexed and fully complexed forms of the wild-type enzyme shows positive maxima at 391, 425, 450, and 483 nm and negative maxima at 370, 470, and 504 nm, with Δε = 2000 M−1 cm−1 at 504 nm. The isosbestic points are at 323, 382, 462, 478, and 485 nm. Fig. 6 depicts the difference spectrum of the titration of oxalate with G99A. It has a shape similar to that of the wild-type enzyme and with the isosbestic points changed to 321, 384, 461, 475, and 489 nm. The positive maxima are at 394, 425, 452, and 482 nm. The negative maxima occur at 371, 468, and 504 nm, with Δε = 1800 M−1 cm−1 at 504 nm. The dissociation constant of the G99A-oxalate complex was determined to be 3.3 × 10−4M by monitoring the absorbance change at 504 nm. Binding is therefore ∼20-fold weaker than with the wild-type enzyme, for which a Kd of 1.6 × 10−5M has been reported (35Ghisla S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; see Table I). The wild-type enzyme-oxalate complex is converted photochemically to a fluorescent flavin N(5)-carbonate adduct, which decays aerobically back to the oxidized enzyme with a t1/2 of 3.8 h at 25°C (36Ghisla S.

Ligands stabilize the closed conformation, whereas the open conformation predominates in the substrate-free species. In its closed form, the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of maltose-binding protein (MBP) are proposed to be aligned to allow residues in both domains to interact simultaneously with complementary sites on the MalF and MalG proteins of the maltodextrin uptake system or with the Tar chemotactic signal transducer.

We introduced cysteines (G69C and S337C) by site-directed mutagenesis into each domain of MBP and found that they formed an interdomain disulfide cross-link that should hold the protein in a closed conformation. This mutant MBP confers a dominant-negative phenotype for growth on maltose, for maltose transport, and for maltose chemotaxis.

Szmelcman S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 139-149Google Scholar). Ligand-bound MBP interacts with a membrane-bound complex of the MalF, MalG, and MalK proteins (2Froshauer S. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10896-10903Google Scholar, 3Dassa E. Hofnung M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2287-2293Google Scholar) to take up maltodextrins via a transmembrane channel formed by MalF and MalG (4Shuman H.A. Silhavy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 560-562Google Scholar, 5Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Google Scholar, 6Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Google Scholar). The NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of MBP appear to bind to MalG and MalF, respectively (7Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 809-822Google Scholar). Certain mutations in malF and malG allow cells lacking MBP to transport maltodextrins (8Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5455-5461Google Scholar, 9Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 654-660Google Scholar). These mutant MalF-MalG (MalFG) complexes can stimulate ATP hydrolysis by MalK in the absence of MBP (6Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding of MBP to the periplasmic face of the MalFG complex normally activates MalK in the cytoplasm.Ligand-bound MBP interacts with the Tar chemotactic signal transducer to initiate an attractant response to maltose (10Hazelbauer G.L.

Janacik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.-H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Google Scholar) evidence indicates that the attractant L-aspartate binds at the dimer interface of the periplasmic domain of Tar, contacting residues in both subunits. Recent data from intergenic complementation studies (53Gardina, P., 1995, Attractant Binding and Signaling in the E. coli Aspartate Receptor. Ph.D. thesis, Texas A&M University.Google Scholar) is consistent with the prediction from computer modeling (19Stoddard B.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 774-776Google Scholar) that MBP also contacts both subunits of Tar.MBP is thought to function as a monomer in which the globular NH2- and COOH-terminal domains are connected by a flexible hinge (20Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar, 21Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Google Scholar). Short maltodextrins, like maltose and maltotriose, are buried in a cleft between the two domains when MBP closes (20Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar). The nonreducing end of longer maltodextrins hangs out of the cleft, and bulky, nonphysiological ligands like cyclomaltoheptaose may prevent closure of the cleft almost completely when they bind to MBP (22Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10553-10559Google Scholar). A bound maltodextrin forms extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds with residues on each wall of the cleft to stabilize the closed conformation. To achieve the closed conformation, one domain of MBP undergoes a 35° rotation and an 8° lateral twist in the hinge relative to the other domain (21Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Google Scholar).A working hypothesis is that when MBP assumes its closed conformation, residues in the two domains are brought into the correct spatial relationship to interact with complementary sites on the MalF-MalG complex or with the Tar dimer (14Zhang Y. Conway C. Rosato M. Suh Y. Manson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22813-22820Google Scholar, 19Stoddard B.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 774-776Google Scholar, 20Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar). However, since MBP (23Shilton B.H. Mowbray S.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1346-1355Google Scholar, 24Bohl E. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Theor.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8931-8936Google Scholar) equilibrate between open and closed forms in the presence or absence of ligands, it is uncertain whether MalFG and Tar first interact with the open, closed, or some intermediate form of MBP.We have introduced mutations into a plasmid-borne malE gene to create the amino acid substitutions G69C and S337C in the normally cysteine-free MBP. Based on the crystal structure of the ligand-bound, closed form of MBP (20Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar), 2J. C. Spurlino and F. A. Quiocho, unpublished data. we anticipated that cysteines at these positions could form an interdomain disulfide bridge. We have determined that this cysteine-substituted MBP does form such an intramolecular cross-link. Growth experiments, transport measurements, and chemotaxis assays strongly suggest that this cross-linking occurs in the periplasm in vivo. The double mutant MBP does not function in maltose transport or chemotaxis, and it inhibits, in a dose-dependent fashion, the function of wild-type MBP in transport and chemotaxis. This result demonstrates that the cross-linked protein, which we infer is in the closed conformation, retains biological activity and competes with wild-type MBP for interaction with MalFG and Tar in vivo.DISCUSSIONThe specificity of interaction of bacterial substrate-binding proteins with membrane-protein complexes responsible for transport and chemoreception has focused on the large conformational changes of the binding proteins as they go from their open to closed forms. An attractive model is that docking of the binding proteins with their membrane counterparts involves residues in both the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of the binding proteins. In the open form of the binding protein these residues are not in the right spatial relationship to interact simultaneously with their docking partners. The large conformational change that occurs as the binding protein assumes a closed form would then bring these residues into the correct juxtaposition to interact with the membrane partner. For MBP, this model is supported by structural (20Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar, 21Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A.

Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 774-776Google Scholar) studies.Recent work from several laboratories (25Walmsley A.R. Shaw J.G. Kelly D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8064-8072Google Scholar, 26Walmsley A.R. Shaw J.G. Kelly D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11175-11181Google Scholar, 27Wolf A. Shaw E.W. Nikaido K. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8931-8936Google Scholar) has suggested that binding proteins are in equilibrium between closed and open forms in the absence or presence of ligand. Rather than triggering closure of the binding proteins, as had originally been proposed (45Quiocho F.A. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London B. 1990; 326: 341-351Google Scholar), recent data suggest that hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic stacking interactions between the ligand and the cleft-exposed faces of the two domains shift the equilibrium in favor of the closed conformation for the two binding proteins, MBP and the lysine-arginine-ornithine-binding protein, for which both open and closed structures have been solved (20Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar, 21Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Google Scholar, 46Oh B.-H. Pandit J.

Techniques used to detect the closed/substrate-free form of periplasmic binding proteins include fluorescence changes of the C4-dicarboxylate-binding protein (DctP) of Rhodobacter capsulatus (25Walmsley A.R. Shaw J.G. Kelly D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8064-8072Google Scholar, 26Walmsley A.R. Shaw J.G. Kelly D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11175-11181Google Scholar); trapping by conformation-specific antibodies with the histidine-binding protein (HisJ) of Salmonella typhimurium (27Wolf A. Shaw E.W. Nikaido K. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23051-23058Google Scholar); and crystallization of the closed/substrate-free form of the galactose/glucose-binding protein (MglB) of S. typhimurium (28Flocco M.M. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8931-8936Google Scholar).The ligand-free form of binding proteins is not functionally inert. In a reconstituted histidine transport system employing purified HisJ and right-side-out membrane vesicles containing HisQMP, it was found that excess substrate-free HisJ inhibited transport (47Prossnitz E. Gee A. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5006-5014Google Scholar). Also, the best fit to the data for maltose transport in Escherichia coli as a function of the concentration of maltose and periplasmic MBP (31Manson M.D. Boos W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Rasmussen B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9727-9733Google Scholar) was obtained when the theoretical model considered that the ligand-bound and the ligand-free forms of MBP compete for interaction with MalFG (23Shilton B.H. Mowbray S.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1346-1355Google Scholar, 24Bohl E. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 172: 83-94Google Scholar).It has usually been assumed that binding proteins initiate interaction with membrane transport proteins or chemotactic signal transducers when the binding proteins are in the closed conformation. However, the available data do not, in our view, rule out a priori that a binding protein, already associated with ligand, may have to assume an open form that can then “clamp down” on the membrane components. Ligand would then stabilize this complex. One scenario requiring such a mechanism would be that an element on a membrane protein might sterically interfere with binding of the closed form of MBP. This element might be accommodated in, or even contribute to, the ternary complex. In the case of transport, such an “intrusive” element could even facilitate subsequent opening of the binding protein to allow substrate release. Wolf et al. (48Wolf A. Shaw E.W. Oh B.-H. De Bondt H. Joshi A.K. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16097-16106Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutant HisJ proteins defective in closing fail to interact normally with the HisQMP membrane transport complex. However, although this result is consistent with a requirement for the closed form in binding to HisQMP, the defect in closing could also interfere with a “clamping down” process of the type just described.Interdomain disulfide cross-bridges have been used before to study the properties of sulfate-binding protein (49Jacobson B.L. He J.J. Vermersch P.S. Lemon D.D. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 27-30Google Scholar) and galactose/glucose-binding protein (50Careaga C.L. Sutherland J. Sabeti J. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3048-3055Google Scholar) in vitro. MBP containing introduced cysteines at residues 69 and 337 (G69C and S337C) spontaneously forms such cross-bridges in the periplasmic space. This circumstance has allowed us to test whether such a cross-linked binding protein can bind to membrane transport and chemotaxis components in vivo.Besides G69C/S337C MBP, we constructed two other double mutant MBPs: S233C/P298C and S233C/A301C. In either mutant protein, if cross-bridges formed they would link the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of MBP at the other end of the cleft from the 69-337 cross-bridge (Fig. 1). We confirmed the presence of the S233C, P298C, and A301C substitutions by DNA sequencing, but no bands with a mobility different from that of wild-type MBP were observed during SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). We inferred that the cross-linking did not occur. We learned later that the 233 and 301 residues may be too far apart in the closed form of MBP to cross-link efficiently. 4F. A. Quiocho, personal communication. The 233 and 298 residues should be close enough to allow cross-linking,4 but the proline to cysteine substitution at residue 298 may distort local secondary structure, thus precluding cross-linking between Cys233 and Cys298. The distortion cannot be global, however, since the P298C and S233C/P298C proteins retain nearly wild-type function (data not shown).G69C/S337C MBP does not function in maltose transport (Fig. 5, Table II) or maltose chemotaxis (Fig. 7). The slow growth and residual transport observed in strains expressing G69C/S337C MBP probably depend on the fraction of the protein that remains noncross-linked (Fig. 3). Reduction of the disulfide bridge in vivo restores transport function to G69C/S337C MBP (Fig. 6, Table II), demonstrating that the two introduced cysteine residues per se do not seriously impair MBP function. Until the structure of the cross-linked form of the protein is determined, we cannot be certain what exact relationship its structure bears to that of the closed form of ligand-bound wild-type MBP.The conclusion that there is a good match between the structure of the cross-linked form of MBP and the closed, ligand-bound form of wild-type MBP is supported by the observation that G69C/S337C MBP is negatively co-dominant for growth on maltose and for maltose chemotaxis (Figs. 8, 9, 10). This result establishes that the cross-linked protein does not have a null phenotype, because it competes with wild-type MBP for MalFG and Tar. The specificity of the competition is demonstrated by the finding that the negative dominance of G69C/S337C MBP is greater when the amount of wild-type MBP is reduced by malE signal-sequence mutations (Fig. 9, Fig. 10).Three lines of evidence strongly suggest that G69C/S337C MBP forms an interdomain disulfide bridge in the periplasm. 1) Oxidizing agents other than atmospheric oxygen were not required to produce the cross-linked protein. 2) Singly cysteine-substituted mutant proteins and the double mutant protein formed nonspecific cross-links to many proteins when cells were lysed under nonreducing conditions, but only the double mutant protein was cross-linked in periplasmic fractions prepared by osmotic shock. 3) The purified G69C/S337C protein yielded the same band of about 45 kDa apparent molecular mass during SDS-PAGE that was seen in osmotic shock fluid. This last result rules out the possibility that the more slowly migrating form of G69C/S337C MBP is cross-linked to another membrane or periplasmic protein.Because the purified double mutant protein migrates at a molecular mass close to that of wild-type MBP in both native and denaturing gels (Fig. 4), the disulfide cross-link appears to be intramolecular, as we predicted, rather than intermolecular. The slight differences in mobility of the double mutant protein on native gels may reflect the presence of two conformations of MBP, even after reduction. One might predict the protein could assume the following forms: 1) an open, reduced conformation without maltose bound; 2) a closed, reduced form with maltose bound; 3) a closed, oxidized form with maltose bound; 4) a closed, oxidized form without maltose bound. Any or all of these forms could migrate somewhat differently on a native gel. Ligand-bound (closed) and ligand-free (open) forms of lysine-arginine-ornithine-binding protein are resolved by high pressure liquid chromatography (51Nikaido K. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20706-20712Google Scholar). Furthermore, maltose bound to some fraction of the purified double mutant MBP could prevent the reduced form of the protein from opening, favoring rapid reoxidation and reformation of the cross-link. The separation of mutant, but not wild-type, liganded and unliganded forms may reflect that the cysteine substitutions alter the equilibrium thermodynamics or the kinetics of MBP opening and closing. Clearly, more work will be required to resolve these alternatives.An important, and still unanswered, question is whether the cross-linked G69C/S337C MBP must harbor maltose in its substrate-binding cleft in order to compete effectively with wild-type MBP. Jacobson et al. (49Jacobson B.L. He J.J. Vermersch P.S. Lemon D.D. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 27-30Google Scholar) showed that an interdomain cross-linked form of G46C/S129C sulfate-binding protein has reduced interdomain flexibility and exhibits a much slower dissociation of sulfate. However, the Cys69-Cys337 cross-bridge is at one end of the cleft (Fig. 1), and it is possible that limited movement between domains still occurs at the other end of the cleft, allowing maltose to enter and leave the binding site. We wanted to make an MBP with two cross-bridges, one at each end of the cleft, which presumably would be truly “locked shut.” Unfortunately, as described above, we have not yet identified another pair of cysteine residues that could provide this second cross-link.Cross-linked MBP was observed in shock fluid prepared from cells grown in glycerol-minimal medium (Fig. 3), in which periplasmic maltose concentrations should be low or nonexistent. Also, preliminary investigations indicate that strains expressing G69C/S337C MBP show increased methylation of Tar in cells grown in minimal glycerol medium with or without maltose, whereas cells producing wild-type MBP show increased methylation of Tar only when they are grown with maltose. 5Y. Zhang, unpublished data. Thus, the double mutant protein appears to be able to induce an attractant signal via Tar without its having been exposed, at least intentionally, to maltose. We plan to measure the kinetics of maltose binding of purified cross-linked G69C/S337C MBP. It will be more difficult, although worthwhile, to determine rigorously whether cross-linked G69C/S337C MBP isolated from cells grown in maltose-free or maltose-replete medium is bound to maltose.We think that the cross-linked MBP will be a useful tool for further investigations of maltose transport and chemotaxis, both in vivo and in vitro. An advantage of our system for such studies is that any decrease in maltose affinity caused by chemotaxis-defective or transport-defective malE mutations should not influence the outcome, thus simplifying the analysis.Treptow and Shuman (7Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 809-822Google Scholar) reported the isolation of malE missense mutations causing specific defects in maltose transport. Some of these have already been shown to be co-dominant (52Hor L.-I. Shuman H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 659-670Google Scholar). Mutations in malE that cause transport defects can be introduced into the G69C/S337C mutant, and the ability of the triple mutant protein to inhibit transport mediated by wild-type MBP can be determined. If the triple mutant protein no longer inhibits, then the transport-defective mutation probably blocks MBP-MalFG binding. If the triple mutant protein still inhibits, then the mutation may interfere with the ability of MBP to initiate transmembrane signaling by MalFG rather than binding. Cross-linked MBP may also prove useful for measuring MBP-stimulated activities of the MalFGK transport complex in vitro (5Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Google Scholar, 6Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Google Scholar). Can, for example, binding of cross-linked MBP to MalFG stimulate ATP hydrolysis by MalK, and if so, how many rounds of ATP hydrolysis does the interaction trigger?We have accumulated a set of malE mutations that disrupt maltose chemotaxis (14Zhang Y. Conway C. Rosato M. Suh Y. Manson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22813-22820Google Scholar), but analogous to the situation with the transport-defective malE mutations, we do not know whether the mutations interfere with binding of MBP to Tar or with generation of the chemotactic signal after the mutant MBP has bound to Tar. We can create triple-mutant MBP species similar to those described above for analyzing transport and ask if the third mutation eliminates the negative dominance for chemotaxis imposed by G69C/S337C MBP. We can also determine whether the triple mutant protein can stimulate increased methylation of Tar in the absence of maltose. The lack of an in vitro assay for MBP binding to Tar, largely because of the apparent low affinity of MBP for Tar (estimated in vivo at 250 µM; 31Manson M.D. Boos W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Rasmussen B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9727-9733Google Scholar), requires us to resort to another method to examine the structure/function relationships of the MBP-Tar interaction. We think that studying the effects of particular mutations on the negative-dominant phenotype of G69C/S337C MBP constitutes such a viable alternative. INTRODUCTIONThe product of the malE gene of Escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP), 1The abbreviations used are: MBPmaltose-binding proteinDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. binds maltose and other maltodextrins with high affinity (1Kellermann O. Szmelcman S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 139-149Google Scholar). Ligand-bound MBP interacts with a membrane-bound complex of the MalF, MalG, and MalK proteins (2Froshauer S. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10896-10903Google Scholar, 3Dassa E. Hofnung M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2287-2293Google Scholar) to take up maltodextrins via a transmembrane channel formed by MalF and MalG (4Shuman H.A. Silhavy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 560-562Google Scholar, 5Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Google Scholar, 6Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Google Scholar). The NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of MBP appear to bind to MalG and MalF, respectively (7Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 809-822Google Scholar). Certain mutations in malF and malG allow cells lacking MBP to transport maltodextrins (8Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5455-5461Google Scholar, 9Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 654-660Google Scholar). These mutant MalF-MalG (MalFG) complexes can stimulate ATP hydrolysis by MalK in the absence of MBP (6Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding of MBP to the periplasmic face of the MalFG complex normally activates MalK in the cytoplasm.Ligand-bound MBP interacts with the Tar chemotactic signal transducer to initiate an attractant response to maltose (10Hazelbauer G.L.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22813-22820Google Scholar). Tar is proposed to form a homodimer (15Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Google Scholar, 16Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Google Scholar). Genetic (12Kossmann M. Wolff C. Manson M.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4516-4521Google Scholar, 13Gardina P. Conway C. Kossmann M. Manson M. J.

Janacik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.-H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Google Scholar) evidence indicates that the attractant L-aspartate binds at the dimer interface of the periplasmic domain of Tar, contacting residues in both subunits. Recent data from intergenic complementation studies (53Gardina, P., 1995, Attractant Binding and Signaling in the E. coli Aspartate Receptor. Ph.D. thesis, Texas A&M University.Google Scholar) is consistent with the prediction from computer modeling (19Stoddard B.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 774-776Google Scholar) that MBP also contacts both subunits of Tar.MBP is thought to function as a monomer in which the globular NH2- and COOH-terminal domains are connected by a flexible hinge (20Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar, 21Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Google Scholar). Short maltodextrins, like maltose and maltotriose, are buried in a cleft between the two domains when MBP closes (20Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar). The nonreducing end of longer maltodextrins hangs out of the cleft, and bulky, nonphysiological ligands like cyclomaltoheptaose may prevent closure of the cleft almost completely when they bind to MBP (22Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10553-10559Google Scholar). A bound maltodextrin forms extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds with residues on each wall of the cleft to stabilize the closed conformation. To achieve the closed conformation, one domain of MBP undergoes a 35° rotation and an 8° lateral twist in the hinge relative to the other domain (21Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Google Scholar).A working hypothesis is that when MBP assumes its closed conformation, residues in the two domains are brought into the correct spatial relationship to interact with complementary sites on the MalF-MalG complex or with the Tar dimer (14Zhang Y. Conway C. Rosato M. Suh Y. Manson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22813-22820Google Scholar, 19Stoddard B.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 774-776Google Scholar, 20Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar). However, since MBP (23Shilton B.H. Mowbray S.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1346-1355Google Scholar, 24Bohl E. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Theor.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8931-8936Google Scholar) equilibrate between open and closed forms in the presence or absence of ligands, it is uncertain whether MalFG and Tar first interact with the open, closed, or some intermediate form of MBP.We have introduced mutations into a plasmid-borne malE gene to create the amino acid substitutions G69C and S337C in the normally cysteine-free MBP. Based on the crystal structure of the ligand-bound, closed form of MBP (20Spurlino J.C. Lu G.-Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar), 2J. C. Spurlino and F. A. Quiocho, unpublished data. we anticipated that cysteines at these positions could form an interdomain disulfide bridge. We have determined that this cysteine-substituted MBP does form such an intramolecular cross-link. Growth experiments, transport measurements, and chemotaxis assays strongly suggest that this cross-linking occurs in the periplasm in vivo. The double mutant MBP does not function in maltose transport or chemotaxis, and it inhibits, in a dose-dependent fashion, the function of wild-type MBP in transport and chemotaxis. This result demonstrates that the cross-linked protein, which we infer is in the closed conformation, retains biological activity and competes with wild-type MBP for interaction with MalFG and Tar in vivo."

We have examined here the effect of lysine, cysteine, arginine, histidine, and tyrosine side chain chemical modification on the DNA binding, homo- and heterodimerization properties of the full-length human retinoic acid receptor α (hRARα). Lysines are the only residues to be engaged in the dimerization with human retinoid X receptor α (hRXRα) in the absence of DNA, whereas histidines are selectively involved in the homodimerization of hRARα in the presence of a RARE. Arginine modification affected the DNA binding activity of each type of dimer, whereas cysteines and tyrosines were primarily involved in the homo- or heterodimerization process in the presence of the same RARE. Modified lysines, interfering with the dimerization with hRXRα, were identified by receptor labeling and peptide mapping. They are located in the hormone binding domain eighth heptad repeat, at positions 360 and 365. In keeping with these results, mutation of Lys360, Val361, and Lys365 diminished strongly the DNA binding activity of hRARα as a homodimer or a heterodimer. Our results thus provide direct evidence for the differential involvement of basic, polar, or aromatic amino acids in the DNA binding, homodimerization, and heterodimerization properties of hRARα. Furthermore, they demonstrate the use of distinct dimerization interfaces and identify the type of amino acids involved in these protein-protein interactions.

Kliewer S.A. Provencal J. Evans R.M. Wright P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 639-650Google Scholar) contain, like the glucocorticoid receptor DBD (17Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Google Scholar), two perpendicular α-helical structures located at the C-terminal end of each zinc finger (noted CI and CII). The first α-helix maps to the so-called P box, and establishes direct contacts with base pairs in the major groove of the core recognition motif, whereas the second α-helix lies perpendicularly to the first one. The D box, located at the N terminus of the second zinc finger, is involved in the heterodimerization of RAR and T3R with RXR when bound to DR5 and DR4, respectively (18Zechel C. Shen X.Q. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1414-1424Google Scholar). Spacing restrictions are imposed by the interaction of the D box of RXR and DR boxes of T3R and RAR. The location of DR boxes is different according to the spacing of the two half-sites of the response element (18Zechel C. Shen X.Q. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1414-1424Google Scholar, 19Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Google Scholar, 20Zechel C. Shen X.Q. Chen J.Y. Chen Z.P. Chambon P.

Although protein-protein interactions between DBDs of each dimerization partner are necessary and sufficient to impose the binding repertoire of the dimer (22Mader S. Chen J.Y. Chen Z.P. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5029-5041Google Scholar), hormone binding domains (HBDs) are also taking a notable part in the dimerization process. Nine heptad repeats were identified in RAR, VDR, and T3R HBDs, and were predicted to be organized in a leucine zipper-like structure (23Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1293-1301Google Scholar). The ninth heptad repeat is required for heterodimerization and different interfaces are involved in the absence or the presence of the cognate ligand (24Aufliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Google Scholar). Amino acids located in this region of RAR, T3R, and RXR have a critical role in regulating the ligand-dependent homo- and heterodimerization properties of these receptors, and may even be determining the binding of RXR/RAR dimers to a DR1 element (22Mader S. Chen J.Y. Chen Z.P. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5029-5041Google Scholar). The first and fifth heptad repeats have also been shown to be required for heterodimerization of hRARα with hRXRα (25Rosen E.D. Beninghof E.G. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11534-11541Google Scholar, 26Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Google Scholar). All of the studies mentioned above demonstrate that multiple interfaces are available to enable homodimerization or heterodimerization of RAR, T3R, VDR, and RXR. Chemical modification of proteins by specific reagents is an useful tool to identify critical residues for a given function of a protein (for review, see 27Glazer A.N. DeLange R.J. Sigman D.S. Work S.R. Work E. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 68-119Google Scholar and references therein). We and others have used cysteine-specific reagents to assess the function of these residues in the ligand binding activity (28Burollaud T. Danze P.M. Tbarka N. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 217-225Google Scholar, 29Chakraborti P.K. Hoeck W. Groner B. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2530-2539Google Scholar, 30Stancato L.F. Hutchison K.A.

Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8436-8442Google Scholar). We also used a similar approach to study the ligand binding properties of hRARα (33Dallery N. Sablonniere B. Grillier I. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12428-12436Google Scholar). In this report, we have assessed the contribution of cysteines, arginines, lysines, histidines, and tyrosines to the DNA binding, homodimerization, and heterodimerization of hRARα. We found that these residues are involved differentially in the different activities of the receptor. Functional, exposed NH2 groups from lysyl residues were mapped to the hormone binding domain of the receptor and more precisely to the eighth heptad repeat motif. Our method therefore defines a general strategy to identify amino acids critical for nuclear receptor functions. Antiproteases, 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, and diethyl pyrocarbonate were purchased from Sigma. p-Hydroxyphenylglyoxal and N-ethylmaleimide were from Pierce, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and tetranitromethane was supplied by Aldrich. Taq DNA polymerase, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG), ampicillin, and kanamycin were from Appligene (Strasbourg, France). Restriction enzymes were from Promega (Madison, WI), and oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Le Sart-Tilman, Belgium). Acrylamide and bisacrylamide mix (Protogel) were from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). The plasmid pHK1, containing the cDNA of hRARα (34Giguere V. Ong E.S. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 624-629Google Scholar), was obtained from V. Giguere and R. M. Evans (Salk Institute, H.H.M.I., La Jolla, CA.). The pQE-9 vector was obtained from Diagen Gmbh (Dusseldorf, Germany). The hRARα cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification and inserted into the pQE-9 vector as a BamHI-HindIII fragment, in order to generate an in-frame fusion protein made of a histidine tag followed by the sequence coding for the receptor. The identity of the amplified cDNA was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. Furthermore, microsequencing of BrCN-generated fragments of the purified protein yielded the expected amino acid sequences. Histidine residues do not to interfere with the ligand binding properties of hRARα (35Lefebvre B. Rachez C. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5477-5485Google Scholar). F1-hRXRα was created by inserting in frame the hRXRα cDNA (36Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Google Scholar) as a HindIII-BglII fragment into the expression vector pF1 (IBI-Kodak, Rochester, NY) containing the Flag epitope. DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) cells were used for routine subcloning procedures, and M15 or SG 13009 (Diagen) bacterial strains containing the Rep4 plasmid coding for the lac repressor were the host cells for overexpression of His-tagged hRARα. JM109 cells were used to overexpress F1-hRXRα. The chicken progesterone receptor (form B), the human glucocorticoid receptor, the human RXRα and the human RARα were synthesized by coupled transcription/translation using the Promega TnT lysate system and [35S]methionine (Dupont NEN, 800-1000 Ci/mmol). Protein synthesis efficiency was monitored by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of an aliquot of the translation reaction. The plasmids coding for cPR-B (Δ10Fx), rGR (T3.1118), hRXRα (SG5-hRXRα), hVDR, and hRARα were kindly provided by H. Gronemeyer (INSERM U.184, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France), K. R. Yamamoto (University of California, San Francisco, CA), U. Reichert (CIRD-Galderma, Sophia-Antipolis, France), J. Wesley-Pike (Ligand Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA), and R. M. Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA), respectively. Transformed M15 or SG13009 bacteria were grown in LB broth supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 25 µg/ml kanamycin to an A600 = 0.7-0.9. Derepression by 1 mM IPTG proceeded for 3 h after which cells were pelleted and washed with 50 ml of ice-cold 1 × PBS. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer PNI0β (2 × PBS, pH 7.4, 0.4 M NaCl, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol). The solution was brought to 150 µg/ml of lysozyme and incubated 30 min on ice, then adjusted to 0.05% deoxycholate and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were lysed by two freeze-thawing cycles when required, and the lysate was brought to 20 mM MgCl2. The lysate was submitted to DNase I digestion (100 units/ml of extract) until the viscosity had significantly decreased. The homogenate was then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4°C, and the supernatant was adjusted to 10% glycerol and stored at −80°C. A procedure similar to that described above was followed, except that LB broth did not contain kanamycin and derepression was initiated by 2 mM IPTG for 5 h. RXR was partially purified from bacterial extracts (40-fold) by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Mono-Q ion exchange chromatography. 500 µl of agarose coupled to nitrilotriacetic acid (NiTA resin, Diagen Gmbh, Dusseldorf, Germany) were poured in a column (1 cm × 10 cm) and packed by gravity flow. The resin was washed by 10 ml of PNGI0 buffer (2 × PBS, 0.4 M NaCl, 20% glycerol) and 2-5 ml of the bacterial extract were layered on the resin by 500 µl of the fraction. The column was then washed successively with 80 ml of PNGI0 buffer and 200 ml of PNGI30 buffer (buffer PNGI0 supplemented with 30 mM imidazole). All steps were performed at 4°C. At this stage, the receptor was eluted from the column by 2 ml of PNGI200 buffer (buffer PNGI0 supplemented with 200 mM imidazole) at room temperature. When polypeptides were submitted to microsequencing procedures, an additional purification step was used to obtain the modified receptor purified to homogeneity (see Fig. 2B). After performing the labeling step, samples were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were visualized by reversible KCl staining. The hRARα polypeptide was then electroeluted using a BioTrap apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) in SDS-PAGE running buffer at 160 V overnight. Oligonucleotides containing the DR5 response elements (see below) and the consensus half-site AGTTCA were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and 10 µCi of γ-[32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The ability of hRARα to heterodimerize with hRXRα, homodimerize, or bind to DNA was assayed as follows. 3 pmol of purified, native, or modified hRARα were incubated with 10-20 pmol of partially purified F1-hRXRα, 20 fmol of the labeled DR5, 1 µg of salmon sperm DNA in a binding buffer giving a final concentration of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Electrophoresis were run in 0.5 × TBE on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run at 150 V for 3 h at room temperature. These conditions were modified when hRARα binding to the DR5 DNA or to the half-site were assayed. 9 pmol of native or modified receptor were incubated as above with the labeled DR5 probe, except that 0.1 µg of nonspecific DNA was used. 12 pmol of native or modified receptor were incubated with the labeled half-site (20 fmol) in the absence of nonspecific DNA. DNA binding reactions were for 30 min on ice, in a final volume of 20 µl. Protein-DNA complexes were then resolved as above except that the stringency of the electrophoresis was reduced (0.25 × TBE at 4°C). Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −70°C. The protocol used is essentially derived from that described in Kurokawa et al. (12Nurokawa R. Yu V.C. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z.H. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Google Scholar) and allowed for the quantitative analysis of His6-hRARα/35S-hRXRα interaction in the absence of a specific DNA response element. Purified His6-hRARα, modified or not by treatment with a specific reagent, was diluted to a final concentration of 20 µg/ml in 1 × PBS and adsorbed (∼0.5 µg/well) to a Corning 96-well tissue culture-treated plate for 16 h at 4°C. Wells were then washed three times with 1 × PBS and coated for 3 h with a 5% fetal calf serum solution in 1 × PBS to saturate nonspecific binding sites. Wells were washed three times with 1 × PBS, and 106 cpm of 35S-labeled hRXRα were loaded in each well and incubated for 90 min at 4°C in 30 µl of binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 130 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol). Unbound hRXRα was removed by four washes with ice-cold binding buffer, and the specifically adsorbed 35S-labeled hRXRα was released by incubation with 50 µl of 0.1% SDS, 0.4 M HCl. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. Alternatively, cross-linking experiments were performed to control for the effect of reagents on the dimerization of His6-hRARα with hRXRα in solution. In these experiments, similar amounts of labeled hRXRα and purified His6-hRARα were mixed and incubated in conditions similar to that used for EMSA, except that Tris-HCl was substituted for HEPES. Dimethyl suberimidate (Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM for 1 h at 4°C, and the cross-linking reaction was quenched by bringing the mix to 400 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Products were then resolved on a 8% SDS-PAGE. A strategy was devised to assess the functionality of hRARα after modification by amino acid-specific reagents and is detailed in Fig. 1. 150 pmol of purified hRARα (5.8 µM) were incubated in the presence of an increasing molar excess of the reagent, such that the ratio of the concentration of the reagent to the amino acid content of the receptor varied from 2 to 40. Note that the His6-hRARα fusion protein contains 18 Cys, 25 Arg, 27 Lys, 13 His, and 10 Tyr residues. All reactions were carried out in a total volume of 26 µl at 12°C, yielding reagents concentrations ranging from 0.012 mM to 13 mM. In all cases, control reactions were performed by omitting only the modifying reagent. The procedure was essentially that described by Yamasaki et al. (37Yamasaki R.B. Vega A. Feeney R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 32-40Google Scholar). Briefly, purified hRARα was incubated in the dark for 120 min in the presence of p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal (HPG) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. The reaction was quenched by bringing the reaction mix to 20 mM arginine. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PyrP) was used essentially as described earlier (27Glazer A.N. DeLange R.J. Sigman D.S. Work S.R. Work E. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 68-119Google Scholar). PyrP was allowed to react with the receptor for 50 min in 20 mM HEPES, pH 6.8, in the dark, and the reaction was quenched by bringing the mix to 20 mM glycine. The resulting Schiff bases were then reduced by 5 mM sodium borohydride (NaBH4) for 5 min at 4°C. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) was used in conditions adapted from that previously established in our laboratory (33Dallery N. Sablonniere B. Grillier I. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12428-12436Google Scholar). Briefly, purified hRARα was incubated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 1 h with varying concentrations of NEM, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) was used in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, as described in Cheng and Nowak (38Cheng K.-C. Nowak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19666-19676Google Scholar). In this case, hRARα was, prior to treatment with DEPC, desalted through a Chromaspin column (2 × 0.5 cm, Clontech) to avoid quenching of the reaction by imidazole, which is used to elute hRARα from the NiTA resin. The reaction was for 120 min and was stopped by bringing the solution to 20 mM imidazole. Tetranitromethane (TNM) was used according to Sokolowski et al. (39Sokolowsky M. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3582-3589Google Scholar). RARα was incubated in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, for 120 min, and the reaction was ended by 20 mM dithiothreitol in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Control reactions were treated similarly in the presence of vehicle (final concentration 0.2% in ethanol (HPG, NEM, DEPC) or H2O/NaBH4 (PyrP)). Upon completion of the chemical modification, the receptor was immediately submitted to the various assays as described above. To further determine the localization of modified lysyl residues within the receptor, purified His6-hRARα was labeled with [3H]formaldehyde (DuPont NEN, 25-100 Ci/mmol). Labeled formaldehyde was diluted twice with unlabeled formaldehyde, and increasing concentrations of reagent were used to react with the receptor (0.3-12 mM final concentration). Variations in reagent concentration did not affect the qualitative outcome of the labeling (data not shown). Cyanogen borohydride (NaBH3CN) was used as a reducing agent and was added in equimolar concentration just prior to the addition of formaldehyde. The reaction was stopped by addition of NaBH3CN (0.5-2.0 mM, according to the concentration of formaldehyde used) and glycine (20 mM final concentration) after a 1-h incubation at 12°C. The receptor was then purified to homogeneity by electroelution as described above (see also Fig. 2B). Samples were lyophilized and dissolved in 70% formic acid. CNBr (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 50-100 mg/ml, and incubation proceeded overnight at room temperature. The reaction mix was lyophilized twice to remove formic acid and the excess of CNBr, and peptides were fractionated by reverse-phase high performance chromatography using a C18 Delta-Pack 15-µm column (300 × 7.5 mm; Waters, Milford, MA). Peptides were eluted by a linear gradient of H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 80% acetonitrile, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions were collected every 30 s, assayed for radioactivity by scintillation counting, and subjected to microsequencing analysis when appropriate. Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection of RARα was performed as described previously using the IBI Enzygraphic Web system (40Tahayato A. Lefebvre P. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1642-1653Google Scholar). The anti-hRARα monoclonal antibody Rα10 was raised against a synthetic peptide from the F domain of hRARα (41Ali M. Torian B.E. Vedeckis W.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1032-1039Google Scholar) and purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Neshanic Station, NJ). The protein content of receptor preparation was assayed by the Bradford assay (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The percentage of receptor in the preparation was estimated by densitometry of silver-stained gels, using a Hoefer GS300 scanning densitometer. The following oligonucleotides and their complements, flanked by BamHI and HindIII sites, were synthesized: (i) a DR5 retinoic acid response element from the promoter P2 of the RAR-β gene (43de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H.G. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Google Scholar) and (ii) a consensus half-site (44Kurokawa R. Direnzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Google Scholar). The sequences of these oligonucleotides are as follows: (i) DR5: gatcGGGTAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCAT, (ii) half-site: agctAGGAGGTCAAATGC. Core recognition sequences are indicated in bold. Point mutations were introduced in the hRARα cDNA using the ExSite polymerase chain reaction-based site directed mutagenesis kit and all reactions were carried out as suggested by the manufacturer (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides were designed to convert Lys360, Val361, and Lys365 into Thr, Gly, and Thr, respectively (mutations are indicated in bold, underlined characters). In addition, a silent mutation was introduced at position 356, converting the CTG codon (Leu) into CTC, thereby introducing a XhoI site used for the initial screening of mutants (indicated in bold). The mutagenic primers sequences were: K360T, 5′-CCGCTGCTCGAGGCGCTAAGGTCTACGTGCG-3′; V361G, 5′-CCGCTGCTCGAGGCGCTAAAGGGCTACGTGCG-3′; K365T, 5′-CCGCTGCTCGAGGCGCTAAAGGTCTACGTGCGGAGCGGAGG-3′. The second oligonucleotide (OLIG), used to synthesize the noncoding strand, had the following sequence: OLIG, 5′-CTCCTGCAGCATGTCCACCCGGTCCGGCTGCTCC-3′. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing, and fragments containing the desired mutations were subcloned into pQE9-hRARα. In addition, the identity of the overexpressed proteins was established using the anti-hRARα antibody Rα10 (data not shown). Microsequencing of peptides was performed on a gas-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems 470A) using the O3RPTH program. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of amino acids were identified on-line as described previously (45Sautière P. Martinage A. Belaiche D. Arkhis A. Chevaillier P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11059-11062Google Scholar). All reactions were carried out using the Sequanase 2.0 sequencing kit as indicated by the manufacturer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Several experimental approaches can be considered to identify and localize functionally important amino acids of hRARα, necessary for either DNA binding or dimerization in the presence or the absence of DNA. Chemical modification of amino acids has some advantages over mutational studies, i.e. studying the protein under its native conformation, and it may also turn out to be a prerequisite for obtaining information about the nature and the localization of functionally important amino acids. Therefore, we used side chain-specific reagents to modify accessible groups in the native, purified hRARα, keeping in mind limitations imposed by optimal reaction conditions for each reagent and the stability of the receptor. These conditions were determined in preliminary experiments using crude extracts, and the reversibility of chemical modifications was assessed whenever possib"
https://openalex.org/W2063833792,"Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides containing the muscle creatinine kinase enhancer sequence (mef-1) and a mutant of the enhancer sequence (mmef-1) were tested for their ability to block muscle differentiation in mouse C2 cells in culture. Maximum inhibition of fusion of myoblasts was observed at 10 µM concentration of mef-1 oligomer. No appreciable inhibition of fusion with the mmef-1 oligomer at the same concentration was observed. Synthesis of myogenin, muscle creatinine kinase, and myosin heavy chain polypeptides were reduced in mef-1 oligomer-treated cells. In contrast, no significant reduction in the synthesis of these polypeptides in mmef-1-treated cells was detected. The overall protein synthesis was not affected. These results suggest that muscle differentiation may be disrupted by competition of the oligomer with the endogenous promoter for specific transcription factor(s)."
