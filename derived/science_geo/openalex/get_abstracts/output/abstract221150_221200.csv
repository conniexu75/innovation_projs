Whether such cytoplasmic inclusions contribute to neuronal death or protect cells from the toxic effects of misfolded proteins remains controversial. In this report, the role of aggresomes in cell viability was addressed in the context of over-expressing α-synuclein and its interacting partner synphilin-1 using engineered 293T cells. Inhibition of proteasome activity elicited the formation of juxtanuclear aggregates with characteristics of aggresomes including immunoreactivity for vimentin, γ-tubulin, ubiquitin, proteasome subunit, and hsp70. As expected from the properties of aggresomes, the microtubule disrupting agents, vinblastin and nocodazole, markedly prevented the formation of these inclusions. Similar to LBs, the phosphorylated form of α-synuclein co-localized in these synphilin-1-containing aggresomes. Although the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells, it had no impact on the percentage of aggresome-positive cells. Finally, quantitative analysis revealed aggresomes in 60% of nonapoptotic cells but only in 10% of apoptotic cells. Additionally, α-synuclein-induced apoptosis was not coupled with increased prevalence of aggresome-bearing cells. Taken together, these observations indicate a disconnection between aggresome formation and apoptosis, and support a protective role for these inclusions from the toxicity associated with the combined over-expression of α-synuclein and synphilin-1.

The LB is a well recognized pathologic feature in several additional age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including dementia with LBs and Alzheimer's disease (1Hashimoto M. Masliah E. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms that lead to the genesis of LBs have not been fully elucidated, several lines of evidence suggest that dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is generally involved in the pathogenesis of PD (2McNaught K.S. Olanow C.W. Halliwell B. Isacson O. Jenner P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). For example, LBs are rich in ubiquitin and proteasome subunits (3Iwatsubo T. Yamaguchi H. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Ihara Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Am. J.

Furthermore, two more gene products associated with hereditary PD, namely, the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1, are both LB components (12Schlossmacher M.G.

Whether LBs are cytotoxic or cytoprotective to neuronal cells remains debatable. These inclusions could potentially be deleterious, because the number of cortical LBs reportedly correlates with the severity of clinical symptoms in dementia with LBs (13Hurtig H.I. Trojanowski J.Q. Galvin J. Ewbank D. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Clark C.M. Glosser G. Stern M.B. Gollomp S.M. Arnold S.E. Neurology. 2000; 54: 1916-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 14Mattila P.M. Rinne J.O. Helenius H. Dickson D.W. Roytta M. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 100: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Alternatively, LB formation may protect neurons by sequestering toxic molecular species. The latter notion is based primarily on the observation that LB-bearing neurons seem to be healthier than neighboring neurons (15Tompkins M.M. Hill W.D. Brain Res. 1997; 775: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and asymptomatic aged individuals often have LBs upon postmortem studies (16Forno L.S. Langston J.W. Neurodegeneration. 1993; 2: 19-24Google Scholar). And lastly, LBs could represent inert end products of a parallel, perhaps non-pathogenic, process. Overexpression of certain proteins such as parkin (17Junn E. Lee S.S. Suhr U.T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47870-47877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), huntingtin (18Waelter S. Boeddrich A. Lurz R. Scherzinger E. Lueder G. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1393-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), presenilin 1 (19Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J.

A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), androgen receptor (21Taylor J.P. Tanaka F. Robitschek J. Sandoval C.M. Taye A. Markovic-Plese S. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (19Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar), as well as inhibition of proteasomal activity have been associated with the formation of stable, multi-ubiquitinated aggregates termed aggresomes. These inclusions are characterized by their localization to the centrosome and by the redistribution of intermediate filaments. The function of aggresomes is thought to be the disposition of misfolded or otherwise damaged proteins that accumulate in cells because of oxidative stress, proteasomal impairment, or other cellular insults. Their formation requires an energy-dependent intracellular transport mechanism, because the intermediate state of aggresomes or micro-aggregates that form in the peripheral cytoplasm are transported to the centrosome through the microtubular cytoskeleton mediated by dynein/dynactin complexes (22Johnston J.A. Illing M.E. Kopito R.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2002; 53: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, aggresomes presumably form as a cellular defense mechanism against elevated concentrations of unwanted proteins (23Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). However, a cytoprotective function for aggresome has not been directly demonstrated. Recently, several similarities between LBs and aggresomes have been observed. In cellular models, the aggresomes that result from parkin over-expression and proteasomal inhibition have both morphologic and immunocytochemical features of LBs, including the core and halo organization and the presence of vimentin, γ-tubulin, α-synuclein, synphilin-1, proteasome subunits, and chaperones (17Junn E. Lee S.S. Suhr U.T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47870-47877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Further, postmortem studies with Parkinson-affected brains have confirmed that LBs contain centrosome components including γ-tubulin, pericentrin, PA700, and P28 (24McNaught K.S. Shashidharan P. Perl D.P. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2136-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, LBs seem to be formed through a mechanism similar to that of aggresomes. To date, two point mutations, A53T and A30P in the α-synuclein gene have been associated with autosomal dominant PD (9Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di Iorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L.

Transgenic mice and flies over-expressing wild-type or mutant α-synuclein have abnormal cellular accumulation of α-synuclein, neuronal dysfunction, and degeneration (26Masliah E. Rockenstein E.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8968-8973Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). These two mutants also show greater toxicity in cellular models than wild-type α-synuclein (31Lee M. Hyun D. Halliwell B. Jenner P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 32Tanaka Y. Engelender S. Igarashi S. Rao R.K. Wanner T. Tanzi R.E. Sawa A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 919-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of α-synuclein has been attributed to its tendency to self-aggregate. In particular, the intermediate oligomeric protofibrillar form has been suggested as the most toxic species (33Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In vitro biophysical studies have shown that pathogenic mutations in α-synuclein facilitate protofibril formation rather than fibrillization (34Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 35Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), although the aggregation pattern of this protein is greatly dependent upon experimental conditions (36Hoyer W. Antony T. Cherny D. Heim G. Jovin T.M. Subramaniam V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Synphilin-1 was isolated as an α-synuclein-interacting protein (37Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and the binding domains in these two partners have been identified (38Kawamata H. McLean P.J. Sharma N. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Neystat M. Rzhetskaya M. Kholodilov N. Burke R.E. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 325: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, a point mutation in synphilin-1 was found in a few German individuals with sporadic PD, further supporting involvement of synphilin-1 in the pathogenesis of PD (40Marx F.P. Holzmann C. Strauss K.M. Li L. Eberhardt O. Gerhardt E. Cookson M.R. Hernandez D. Farrer M.J. Kachergus J. Engelender S. Ross C.A. Berger K. Schols L. Schulz J.B. Riess O. Kruger R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Synphilin-1 is a presynaptic protein associated with synaptic vesicles (41Ribeiro C.S. Carneiro K. Ross C.A. Menezes J.R. Engelender S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23927-23933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and is also present in LBs, especially in the core region (42Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Tanaka Y. Yoshimoto M. Mori F. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Acta Neuropathol. 2002; 103: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Co-expression of α-synuclein and synphilin-1 in cellular models gives rise to eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (37Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and the over-expression of synphilin-1 alone can also produce inclusions in cultured cells (43O'Farrell C. Murphy D.D. Petrucelli L. Singleton A.B. Hussey J. Farrer M. Hardy J. Dickson D.W. Cookson M.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 97: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We reported previously (44Lee G. Junn E. Tanaka M. Kim Y.M. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that synphilin-1 is polyubiquitinated and subjected to proteasomal degradation. Upon proteasomal impairment, synphilin-1 is preferentially concentrated in perinuclear aggregates in 293T cells together with ubiquitin and α-synuclein. Additionally, synphilin-1 overexpression increases the vulnerability to the toxicity of proteasome inhibitors (44Lee G. Junn E. Tanaka M. Kim Y.M. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed the question whether aggresomes are cytoprotective or cytotoxic. We first characterized aggresomes formed in synphilin-1-engineered cells challenged by proteasome inhibitors. We then examined the role of these inclusions in apoptotic cell death. We found that aggresome formation does not directly correlate with cell death. Rather, aggresomes seem to promote cell survival. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—293T cells (ATCC) were transfected with FLAG-synphilin-1 to isolate stable transformant lines (named Synph-293) and cultured in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (44Lee G. Junn E. Tanaka M. Kim Y.M. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Synph-293 or 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. The following antibodies were used: FLAG Cy3-conjugated monoclonal (1:2000, Sigma), GTU-88 γ-tubulin monoclonal (1:1000, Sigma), V9 vimentin monoclonal (1:2000, Oncogene, San Diego, CA), 20S proteasome subunit rabbit polyclonal (1:200, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), Hsp70 rabbit polyclonal (1:200, Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA), ubiquitin rabbit polyclonal (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (1:400, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An antibody raised against phosphorylated α-synuclein at Ser-129 was described previously (45Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). MG132 and lactacystin were purchased from Calbiochem, vinblastin sulfate and nocodazole from Sigma, and z-VAD-fmk from Promega (Madison, WI). cDNA Constructs and Transfection—An expression vector for FLAG-tagged synphilin-1 was cloned as described before (44Lee G. Junn E. Tanaka M. Kim Y.M. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Wild-type, A53T, and A30P α-synuclein cloned previously (46Kanda S. Bishop J.F. Eglitis M.A. Yang Y. Mouradian M.M. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) were transferred to pcDNA3.1 by restriction enzyme cleavage. To generate α-synuclein cDNA with an S129A substitution, wild-type α-synuclein cDNA was used as template to introduce the T385G point mutation using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate method using a commercially available kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Seven micrograms of DNA were suspended with calcium phosphate in HEPES-buffered saline per each 6-cm plate. After a 10-h incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with fresh medium. As appropriate, 0.35 μg of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) was mixed with DNA. Immunocytochemistry—Synph-293 cells grown on poly-lysine-coated glass coverslips were rinsed once with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and treated with 1% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 20 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody diluted with 1% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. Coverslips were rinsed with PBS five times and then incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody at 4 °C. After removing from the antibody solution, cells were incubated with 10 μm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 2 min. And after washing with PBS three times for 5 min each, the coverslips were mounted with the anti-fading medium (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) and visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Quantification of Apoptotic Cells and Aggresome Formation—Cells transfected with the indicated cDNA(s) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were transferred to a glass coverslip coated with polylysine and cultured for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 10 μm MG132 or lactacystin. In certain experiments, 100 μm z-VAD-fmk, 1 μm of vinblastin, or 100 ng/ml of nocodazole were added as indicated. After incubation for 14 h, cells were fixed and immunostained using anti-FLAG Cy3-conjugated antibody, followed by staining with DAPI as described above. EGFP-expressing cells were visualized using a fluorescence microscope with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter and were determined to be apoptotic based on DAPI staining that showed condensed or fragmented chromatin. Aggresome formation was detected as a single perinuclear anti-FLAG-positive inclusion and was confirmed by the indented shape of the nucleus. For each cell condition, more than 200 transfected cells from randomly selected fields were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Optiphot-2, Nikon) and IPLab software (Biovision Technologies, Exon, PA). Each experiment was repeated three times. Consistent with our previous report (44Lee G. Junn E. Tanaka M. Kim Y.M. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), 293T cells stably over-expressing synphilin-1 (Synph-293) developed perinuclear round structures immunoreactive to FLAG-synphilin-1 after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 14 h (Fig. 1). To confirm that these inclusions represented aggresomes and to demonstrate their similarities to LBs, further characterization was undertaken. (i) Vimentin immunoreactivity, which distributes diffusely throughout the cytoplasm under basal conditions (data not shown), localized to the halo of synphilin-1-positive perinuclear inclusions upon proteasome inhibition (Fig. 1a). (ii) γ-Tubulin, which is a normal component of the centrosome (24McNaught K.S. Shashidharan P. Perl D.P. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2136-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 47Zheng Y. Jung M.K. Oakley B.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 817-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and is only weakly immunoreactive in untreated cells (data not shown), acquired an intense signal upon MG132 challenge (Fig. 1b). (iii) Synphilin-1 aggregates were immunoreactive to antibodies against ubiquitin (Fig. 1c), 20S proteasome subunit (Fig. 1d), and to Hsp-70 (Fig. 1e), all of which are components of LBs (4Ii K. Ito H. Tanaka K. Hirano A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 28Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 48Kuzuhara S. Mori H. Izumiyama N. Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Acta Neuropathol. 1988; 75: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In particular, the immunoreactivity to Hsp-70 localized intensely to the halo of the aggregates (Fig. 1e), whereas that of ubiquitin and 20S proteasome subunit distributed homogeneously in both the core and halo (Fig. 1, c and d). Finally, an antibody raised against phosphorylated α-synuclein at Ser-129 immunostained these inclusions (Fig. 1f), similar to LBs (45Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis indicated that only about 7% of Synph-293 cells harbored synphilin-1-positive aggresomes in the absence of a proteasome inhibitor, but that this percentage increased dramatically to 48% in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 2). Treatment with microtubule destabilizing agents, vinblastin or nocodazole, reduced the number of aggregate-containing cells, consistent with the properties of aggresomes (23Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Thus, aggresomes formed in Synph-293 cells are dependent upon the microtubule-mediated intracellular transport system. The relationship between aggresome formation and apoptotic cell death upon proteasomal inhibition was assessed next (Fig. 3). FLAG-synphilin-1-positive aggresomes co-localizing with ubiquitin were detected in both non-apoptotic as well as apoptotic cells identified by condensed DAPI-stained nuclei (Fig. 3a). Similarly, vimentin immunoreactive aggresomes were observed in some apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells (Fig. 3b). Thus, aggresomes can be detected even in relatively late stages of apoptosis. However, neither FLAG-synphilin-1 (Fig. 3a) nor vimentin immunoreactivity (Fig. 3b), along with DAPI staining, revealed a strong correlation between aggresomes and apoptotic nuclei. Some aggresome-bearing cells were found not to be apoptotic, whereas some aggresome-negative cells were clearly apoptotic. To begin quantifying the relationship between cell viability and aggresome formation in the context of synphilin-1 and α-synuclein over-expression, Synph-293 cells were transiently co-transfected with different cDNA isoforms of α-synuclein. In addition, EGFP was co-transfected to distinguish transfected cells from non-transfected ones. Approximately 30% of cells were fluorescent by EGFP in each transfection experiment. Green fluorescent positive cells were evaluated for apoptosis by DAPI staining and for aggresome content by FLAG immunoreactivity, as in Fig. 3a. The pathogenic mutants of α-synuclein, A53T and A30P, exacerbated cell death more than their wild-type counterpart, whereas the phosphorylation mutant S129A did not increase cell death (Fig. 4). The rank order of apoptotic cell death was: mock control < wild-type = S129A < A30P < A53T. Toxicity due to pathogenic α-synuclein mutants increased significantly by 2.0- to 2.5-fold, compared with mock control cells. On the other hand, aggresome formation in α-synuclein-transfected cells was only minimally higher than in empty vector transfected cells. The count of aggresome-bearing cells with A30P expression, for example, was merely 1.3-fold higher than mock control. These data suggest that aggresome formation does not necessarily correlate with apoptotic cell death. To further examine a possible connection between aggresome formation and apoptosis, these two parameters were measured in cells co-expressing wild-type α-synuclein and synphilin-1 after treatment with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk in the presence of MG132. Proteasome inhibition resulted in apoptotic morphology in about 19% of these cells. As expected, this percentage diminished significantly down to 10% in the presence of z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 5a). Aggresome count, on the other hand, which was about 50% in the presence of MG132 alone, was not affected by addition of the caspase inhibitor (Fig. 5b). These observations confirmed that the increased cell death due to co-expression of α-synuclein and synphilin-1 is dissociated from aggresome formation. To determine the role of aggresomes in cell death, formation of these inclusions in apoptotic cells was quantified directly. Synph-293 cells transfected with various α-synuclein isoforms were individually categorized based on apoptotic morphology and aggresome formation (Fig. 6). Among apoptotic cells, a much larger proportion was aggresome-negative compared with aggresome-positive cells (Fig. 6a). For example, about 20% of A53T α-synuclein-transfected cells were apoptotic but aggresome-negative, whereas only about 2% were apoptotic and aggresome-positive. Notably, the increase in cell death due to co-expression of synphilin-1 and α-synuclein derived exclusively from aggresome-negative cells, whereas cells bearing aggresomes did not seem to be susceptible to this form of cell death (Fig. 6a). On the other hand, among non-apoptotic cells over-expressing α-synuclein isoforms, aggresome-positive cells were slightly more prevalent than aggresome-negative cells (Fig. 6b). Among cells transfected with α-synuclein isoforms, aggresomes were present in 53–60% of non-apoptotic cells but only in 10–13% of apoptotic cells. Similar results were obtained when counting aggresomes based on vimentin immunostaining (data not shown). Taken together, we concluded that cells with aggresomes are more resistant to toxicity associated with the co-expression of α-synuclein and synphilin-1 than cells without aggresomes in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. The present data highlight three aspects of inclusion body formation associated with synphilin-1 and α-synuclein overexpression and with proteasomal impairment. (i) These cytoplasmic inclusions represent aggresomes based both on morphological and molecular characteristics, including the round structure with a core and halo organization and the juxtanuclear localization, as well as on immunocytochemical evidence confirming the presence of centrosome comp"

Formation of the signaling IL-1 receptor complex results in the activation and hyperphosphorylation of IRAK-1, which leads to a pronounced shift of its apparent molecular mass in gel electrophoresis. Presently, the individual residues phosphorylated in IRAK-1 and the consequences for IRAK-1 function are unknown. We define sequential phosphorylation steps in IRAK-1, which are, in vitro, autophosphorylation. First, IRAK-1 is phosphorylated at Thr209. By fluorescence energy transfer experiments, we demonstrate that Thr209 phosphorylation results in a conformational change of the kinase domain, permitting further phosphorylations to take place. Substitution of Thr209 by alanine results in a kinase-inactive IRAK-1. Second, Thr387 in the activation loop is phosphorylated, leading to full enzymatic activity. Third, IRAK-1 autophosphorylates several times in the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich ProST region between the N-terminal death domain and kinase domain. Hyperphosphorylation of this region leads to dissociation of IRAK-1 from the upstream adapters MyD88 and Tollip but leaves its interaction with the downstream adapter TRAF6 unaffected. This identifies IRAK-1 as a novel type of adapter protein, which employs its own kinase activity to introduce negative charges adjacent to the protein interaction domain, which anchors IRAK-1 at the active receptor complex.

Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The TIR family comprises the IL-1 receptor subfamily, recognizing the endogenous proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-18, and the members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) subfamily, recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (reviewed in Ref. 2O'Neill L.A. Dinarello C.A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 206-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, all members of the TIR family form multimeric receptor complexes. These receptors share the cytoplasmic TIR domain, which is indispensable for signal transduction. The TIR domain serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of adapter proteins. This results in the activation of a core signaling module consisting of MyD88, IRAK-4 and IRAK-1, and TRAF6. Subsequently, several central signaling pathways are activated in parallel, the activation of NF-κB being a hallmark of the inflammatory response.

Presently, the family of human IRAK molecules consists of four members: IRAK-1 (7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), IRAK-2 (8Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), IRAK-M (9Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Although these molecules share significant sequence and structural homologies, they also show pronounced differences. Thus, deletion of IRAK-4 abrogates cell responsiveness to IL-1 and a series of other ligands of the TIR family (11Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A.

Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of IRAK-1 only drastically reduces IL-1, IL-18, and lipopolysaccharide responsiveness (12Thomas J.A.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). IRAK-1 was the first family member identified due to its association with the activated IL-1 receptor complex (16Martin M. Bol G.F. Eriksson A. Resch K. Brigelius-Flohe R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1566-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and its pronounced autophosphorylation (7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). During IL-1 stimulation, IRAK-1 is recruited to the IL-1 receptor complex, where it is anchored via protein-protein interactions to the adapter proteins MyD88 (8Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M.

Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Recently, additional adapter molecules have been described that interact with IRAK-1 and participate in the formation of a signaling complex at the receptor. They interact directly with IRAK-1 and include Pellino1 (21Jiang Z. Johnson H.J. Nie H. Qin J. Bird T.A. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10952-10956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and Pellino2 (22Yu K.Y. Kwon H.J. Norman D.A. Vig E. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4075-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Others facilitate interaction of IRAK-1 with the downstream adapter TRAF6 such as TIFA (23Takatsuna H. Kato H. Gohda J. Akiyama T. Moriya A. Okamoto Y. Yamagata Y. Otsuka M. Umezawa K. Semba K. Inoue J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12144-12150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). During activation, IRAK-1 becomes heavily phosphorylated, giving rise to a pronounced shift in gels, now accepted as a hallmark of IRAK activation. Hyperphosphorylated IRAK-1 leaves the receptor complex and interacts with TRAF6 (24Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) and TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 (25Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). At least in vitro, IRAK-1 autophosphorylates, demonstrating that it is an active protein kinase. Interestingly, however, no substrate for IRAK-1 has been identified downstream of IRAK-1 yet. In fact, the only substrates known so far are IRAK-1 itself, Tollip (19Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and Pellino2, an adapter molecule that is phosphorylated by IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 (26Strelow A. Kollewe C. Wesche H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was reported that the consequences of phosphorylation of IRAK-1 were dissociation from MyD88 (7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), termination of the interaction with Tollip (20Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), and massive alteration of the half-life of IRAK-1 (27Jensen L.E.

However, none of these reports identified the individual domains or the precise amino acids that actually become phosphorylated in IRAK-1 or explained why IRAK-1 shows such a drastic shift in electrophoretic mobility upon activation. The lack of downstream targets and the observation that IRAK-1 kinase activity is dispensable for IL-1 signaling (9Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 15Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell.

Volpe F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) suggest that the kinase activity of IRAK-1 may serve functions other than relaying and amplifying IL-1 signals. We sought to identify and characterize the sites of IRAK-1 (auto)phosphorylation and to describe the consequences of (auto)phosphorylation for the function of IRAK-1 in IL-1 signaling. Here we show that phosphorylation of IRAK-1 is due to three sequential phosphorylation steps, which in vitro are autophosphorylation steps. We identify Thr209 as the critical amino acid for activation of IRAK-1 kinase activity and demonstrate that Thr387 in the activation loop is required to achieve full enzymatic activity. The result of full kinase activation is hyperphosphorylation in the ProST region. We show that this hyperphosphorylation regulates the interaction of IRAK-1 with its upstream adapters MyD88 and Tollip but leaves its interaction with the downstream adapter TRAF6 unaffected. These data suggest that IRAK-1 uses its kinase activity to autophosphorylate and thereby limit its own availability as an adapter protein in IL-1 signaling. Recombinant human IL-1β was kindly provided by D. Boraschi (Dompé, L'Aquila, Italy), and recombinant human TNF-α was from BASF AG (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Anti-FLAG reagents were from Sigma. Antisera to human IRAK-1, TRAF6, and MyD88 were kindly provided by Z. Cao (Tularik Inc., South San Francisco, CA). EL-4 6.1 cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1 mm pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 2 mml-glutamine. Human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293 cells and murine IRAK-1-deficient fibroblasts (IRAKminus) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Mammalian expression vectors encoding wild-type human IRAK-1 (pRK5-IRAK) and human IRAK-1 with a defective ATP-binding site (IRAK K239S) were kind gifts of Z. Cao (Tularik) and have been described previously (7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The control plasmid pRK5* was generated from pRK5-IRAK by excision of the insert and religation of the vector. N-terminally FLAG-tagged fragments of IRAK-1 were constructed by inserting PCR-generated cDNA fragments in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-FLAG (kind gift of B. Lüscher, Aachen, Germany). Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) exactly as specified by the manufacturer and as described previously (9Wesche H. Gao X.

IRAK-1 deletion mutants (ΔProST, ΔKD) were generated by PCR using the plasmid coding for FLAG-tagged IRAK-1wt as template. The primers were designed to flank the regions to be eliminated with overhangs resulting in a hemagglutinin tag at the site of deletion. The program PEST-FIND (available on the World Wide Web at www.at.embnet.org/embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind/) (31Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar) was used with window size set to 10. 2 × 106 HEK 293 cells were seeded into 100-mm Petri dishes (Falcon, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) and transfected the following day by calcium phosphate precipitation with a total of 10 μg of DNA. The amounts of coding plasmids used were optimized for each construct and thus differed respectively. By adding empty vector, the total amount of DNA was kept constant in all transfections. After an overnight incubation period, the medium was changed, and 24 h later cells were collected, washed, and lysed for 30 min in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 5 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Nuclei and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Proteins were precipitated either with M2-agarose beads (Sigma) using their FLAG tag or by the indicated antibodies and Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing with lysis buffer, the beads were either subjected to in vitro kinase assays (see below) or were heated in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunostained with the indicated antibodies. Reactive bands on Western blots were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Pull-down experiments were performed with the indicated antibodies as described previously (7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 18Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in a kinase reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2,1 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was stopped by heating in SDS sample buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, and autoradiographies were performed. Enzymatic Digest—The Coomassie-stained IRAK-1 KDL4 and IRAK-1 K239S KDL bands from one-dimensional SDS-PAGE were excised, destained, reduced, alkylated, and digested in-gel with trypsin (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate by using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The tryptic digestion was carried out for 12 h at 37 °C. Liquid Chromatography/Electrospray Ionization-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (n = 2, 3) was performed on an LCQDECA ion trap mass analyzer interfaced with a Surveyor HPLC system (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA), and a 0.18-mm inner diameter × 100-mm length reverse-phase C18 column BioBasic 18 (ThermoHypersil-Keystone, Bellefonte, PA) was used. The flow rate was 25 μl/min. A precolumn split directed ∼3 μl/min of HPLC effluent to the mass spectrometer. A gradient of 10 min of 100% solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) followed by 60 min of 0–70% solvent B (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) was employed. 5 μl of in-gel tryptic digest was diluted to 20 μl with 14 μl of solvent A and 1 μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid before injection into the LC column. IRAK-1 KDL4 (aa 194–536) cDNA was amplified via PCR with a 5′ XhoI recognition sequence, followed by the FLAG coding sequence and a3′ EcoRI recognition sequence. The PCR product was inserted into the vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) via XhoI and EcoRI, excised via AgeI and EcoRI together with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cDNA, and inserted into pQBI50-fN1 (Q-BIOgene, Heidelberg, Germany). The plasmids were kindly provided by M. Gaestel (Institute for Biochemistry, Hannover Medical School). HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA coding for either wild type or T209A mutated EGFP-KDL4-enhanced blue fluorescent protein. 40 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 270 mm sucrose, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), pH 7.0). DNA was pelleted by 15,000 × g centrifugation for 20 min and lysates were cleared by an additional 100,000 × g centrifugation step. Fluorescence emission spectra of lysates were measured from 400–600 nm with an excitation wavelength of 378 nm (direct excitation of enhanced blue fluorescent protein). After subtraction of the emission spectrum of lysate from empty vector-transfected cells, the relative fluorescence intensity was normalized against the fluorescence intensity at 508 nm when EGFP was directly excited at 473 nm. Additionally, the fusion proteins were affinity-purified on M2-agarose, eluted with FLAG peptide, and then analyzed. Fluorescence measurements were performed at the Biophysics Department of the Hannover Medical School with the kind support of Dr. U. Curth. 1 × 107 HEK293RI cells (stably overexpressing the type I IL-1 receptor) were seeded into 100-mm Petri dishes and on the next day stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-1β for the indicated periods of time. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Lysis, immunoprecipitation with anti-IRAK-1 antibody 2A9, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunostaining with 2A9 were performed as described above. For phosphatase treatment, washed immunoprecipitates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.125 units/μl protein phosphatase 1 (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 30 °C in the provided reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.0). After removing the buffer, beads were heated in SDS sample buffer. All experiments were routinely performed at least three times with comparable results. IRAK-1 is a multidomain protein containing four individual domains: an N-terminal death domain (aa 1–109) (32Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar); a stretch rich in proline, serine, and threonine residues (aa 110–211), termed the ProST region by us and previously named the undetermined region by Li et al. (33Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); a conserved serine/threonine-specific protein kinase domain (aa 212–536); and a unique C terminus (aa 537–712) containing three TRAF6 interaction consensus motifs (34Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H.

Identification of Phosphorylated IRAK-1 Domains—Although it has been known for a long time that IRAK-1 becomes heavily phosphorylated upon IL-1 stimulation of cells or upon overexpression, the domains phosphorylated or the individual amino acids have not yet been defined. At least in vitro, IRAK-1 is capable of autophosphorylation, which results in a shift identical to the one observed in cells stimulated with IL-1. Furthermore, recombinant IRAK-1 produced in insect cells and purified to homogeneity yields the typical IRAK-1 shift after incubation in an in vitro kinase assay in the absence of any further proteins (data not shown). First we defined the domains and amino acids phosphorylated in IRAK-1. Since these questions cannot be addressed with endogenous IRAK-1, we chose overexpression systems in which IRAK-1 is known to autophosphorylate (7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). This allowed us to generate IRAK-1 mutants lacking individual domains or containing defined point mutations. A series of constructs was produced including the individual domains, and these were tested either for their autophosphorylative capacity or whether they could serve as a substrate for IRAK-1 (Fig. 1A). All proteins carried an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag. They were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, either alone or in combination with full-length IRAK-1. Then co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP) were performed using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody beads, and the precipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. We developed this experimental set-up (forced co-IP; schematically depicted in Fig. 1B), because it closely resembles the situation in IRAK-1 dimers or oligomers that form by the homotypic interaction of IRAK-1 death domains at the receptor complex (9Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), possibly facilitated by MyD88 dimers (17Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, IRAK-N208, composed of death domain and most of the ProST region and thus not enzymatically active (Fig. 1C, lane 1), served as a substrate for full-length IRAK-1 (lane 2). The kinase domain (KDL) autophosphorylated (lane 3). Neither the death domain (aa 2–109) nor the C terminus (aa 537–712) were phosphorylated by IRAK-1 (data not shown). These results identify the ProST region and the kinase domain as the two domains of IRAK-1 that become phosphorylated. Kinase Activity of IRAK-1 Depends on the Phosphorylation of Threonine 209 —Interestingly, the protein comprising exactly the minimal homology sequence of the kinase domain (Fig. 1, KD; aa 212–536) did not autophosphorylate (Fig. 1C, lane 5), whereas a protein containing part of the ProST region (KDL; aa 149–536) was enzymatically active (Fig. 1C, lane 3). We sequentially truncated KDL (aa 149–536) to KDL4 (aa 194–536), which was still enzymatically active (Fig. 2A). This N-terminal extension contained three phosphorylatable amino acids (Ser196, Ser206, and Thr209). By substituting these three amino acids with alanine residues, Thr209 was identified as the critical amino acid for maintaining kinase activity. Mutating Thr209 into alanine completely abolished auto-phosphorylation in the kinase domain of IRAK-1 (Fig. 2A) or in full-length IRAK-1 (Fig. 2B). Substitution of Thr209 by the negatively charged amino acids glutamate or aspartate did not result in a constitutively active kinase but rendered these IRAK-1 Thr209 mutant proteins as inactive as IRAK-1 K239S in which the ATP binding site was mutated (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that Thr209 is essential for enzymatic activity, and they strongly suggest that Thr209 is a site of phosphorylation. In order to ascertain whether threonine 209 was indeed phosphorylated, we performed liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (n = 2, 3) experiments on peptides derived from IRAK-1 KDL4 (and IRAK-1 K239S KDL as unphosphorylated control; data not shown). The MSn was operated to isolate and fragment target ions based on the predicted mass of the tryptic peptide containing the phosphorylated threonine 209 (aa 208–217, GTpHNFSEELK; m/z 1242.2). Fig. 2C shows the MS2 spectrum of +2 charged peptide ions of aa 208–217 (m/z 621.6). In agreement with previous findings (35DeGnore J.P. Qin J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 36Cao P. Stults J.T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1600-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the dominant ion (+2; m/z 572.5) corresponded to the loss of 98 Da (H3PO4), but a large series of b- and y-type ions were also observed. According to Fig. 2C (upper panel), a partial series of y ions (y5, y7), which did not contain a phosphate group, and b3, which contained a phosphate group, clearly indicated that the phosphorylation site was located at position of threonine 209. To investigate further the phosphorylation of this peptide, a MS3 experiment was carried out by isolating and fragmenting the dominant product ion (m/z 572.5). Fig. 2C (lower panel) shows the MS3 spectrum of m/z 572.5. Extensive fragmentation along the peptide backbone was observed because of the facile loss of the phosphate group. In agreement with the MS2 results, y ion series from y5 to y8–18 (loss of H2O) did not contain dehydroalanine (phosphorylated serine that has lost H3PO4), and b3 ion contained dehydroaminobutyric acid (phosphorylated threonine that has lost H3PO4). From these results, threonine 209 was unambiguously determined as the phosphorylation site in the peptide aa 208–217.

Here, we report that during neuroexcitotoxicity, calcineurin A (CnA) is directly cleaved by calpain in vitro and in vivo, resulting in the enzyme being converted to an active form. Mass spectrometry identified three cleavage sites in CnA, two of which were constitutively active forms. Overexpression of the cleaved CnA induced caspase activity and neuronal cell death. Calpain inhibitors and membrane-permeable calpastatin peptides not only blocked the cleavage of CnA, but also protected against excitotoxic neuronal cell death in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that CnA is a crucial target for calpain, and the calpain-mediated activation of CnA triggers excitotoxic neurodegeneration.

Neuronal cell death in stroke, trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis has been proposed to result from the accumulation of high local concentrations of excitatory amino acids, particularly glutamate (1Oleny J.W. de Gubareff T.

Despite years of investigation, the detailed molecular events involved in neuronal degeneration following intracellular Ca2+ overload have been unclear. Calcineurin and calpain, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase and a Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, respectively, are thought to be two of the most important Ca2+-dependent effectors involved in neuronal cell death. Calcineurin is abundant in several neural regions such as the hippocampus, neocortex, striatum, and cerebellum, all of which have been shown to be highly vulnerable to neuroexcitotoxic attacks (8Matsui H.

One proposed mechanism that calcineurin triggers dysfunction of the mitochondria in degenerative neurons has been strongly supported (10Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Kjrajewski S. Yamaguchi Y.

Subsequently, cytochrome c release from the mitochondria is enhanced and the released cytochrome c activates the caspase pathway, resulting in neuronal apoptosis (10Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M.

On the other hand, calpain is also thought to play a critical role in a form of neuronal cell death involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and focal or global cerebral ischemia (14Saido T.C.

The phosphatase becomes active when calmodulin binds to the binding site in CnA because the binding triggers the release of the autoinhibitory domain from the catalytic active site (21Klee C.B.

However, it has not been elucidated whether CnA undergoes cleavage in response to certain pathological conditions and whether the cleaved CnA induces neuronal cell death in vivo.

Neuronal Cultures—Primary cultures of hippocampal and cortical neurons from E17-19 Wistar rats (Japan SLC Inc.) were prepared as described previously (24Matsushita M. Tomizawa K. Moriwaki A. Li S-T. Terada H. Matsui H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 15: 6000-6007Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the cortex and hippocampus were dissected on ice in Hank's balanced salt solution (Sigma) and dissociated with 0.25% trypsin in HBSS. Neurons were seeded to a density of 2.7 × 103/mm2 on dishes coated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml). After 24 h, neurobasal growth medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum was replaced with neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen) instead of serum. The cultures were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 10-14 days. Western Blotting Analysis—Western blotting analysis was performed as described previously (25Tomizawa K. Ohta J. Matsushita M. Moriwaki A. Li S-T. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2590-2597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the polyclonal antibodies against CnA were from StressGen Biotech (Victoria, BC, Canada); the monoclonal CnB antibodies were produced as described previously (26Moia L.J. Matsui H. de Barros G.A. Tomizawa K. Miyamoto K. Kuwata Y. Tokuda M. Itano T. Hatase O. Brain Res. 1994; 648: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); the polyclonal antibodies against cabin-1 and non-erythroid α-spectrin mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), positive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (25Tomizawa K. Ohta J. Matsushita M. Moriwaki A. Li S-T. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2590-2597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after being treated under different experimental conditions, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) for 15 min and were then membrane-permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After blocking with 10% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h, cells were incubated with anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 antibodies (1:200 dilution, Sigma) or anti-active caspase-3 antibodies (1:200 dilution, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then incubated with secondary TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (1:200 dilution, Sigma). Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss confocal microscope. Recombinant Adenovirus Preparation—The recombinant adenoviruses encoding 48-kDa truncated CnA α isoform (T-CnA), wild-type CnB and lacZ cDNAs were produced as described previously (12Springer J.E. Azbill R.D. Nottingham S.A. Kennedy S.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7246-7251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rat CnA α isoform cDNA corresponding to T-CnA (amino acid residues 1-424) and wild-type rat CnB cDNA were subcloned into pAxCAwt cosmid vector (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant adenovirus of T-CnA (pAdex-CnA-T) and CnB (pAdex-CnB) containing chicken β-actin promoter and SV40 polyadenylation signal were produced using the Adenovirus Expression Vector kit (Takara). The recombinant adenoviruses were purified and concentrated using the CsCl step-gradient method as described previously (27Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S-T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y-F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus of lacZ (pAdex-lacZ) was also produced following the manufacturer's protocol. Detection of Neuronal Cell Death—Immunostained neurons were incubated with Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml) for 1 min, and then the morphology of the nucleus was observed with a fluorescence microscope. Apoptotic neuronal cells were identified by the presence of highly condensed or fragmented nuclei. Representative graphs are shown for experiments where at least 4 randomly chosen fields with 150 cells were scored. TUNEL assays were performed following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics). The staining was observed using a confocal microscope (Zeiss). Representative graphs are shown for experiments where at least 4 randomly chosen fields with 100 cells were scored. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Rat wild-type CnA α isoform, truncated CnAs encoding 57-kDa, 48-kDa, and 45-kDa CnA α isoform, and the wild-type CnB cDNAs were subcloned into a mammalian cell expression vector (pcDNA3.1/myc-His, Invitrogen). These plasmids (1 μg) were transfected into ∼70% confluent HEK 293 cells by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. To measure the NFAT transcriptional activity, 1 μg luciferase reporter vector (pNFAT-TA-Luc, BD Biosciences Clontech) was also transfected into HEK 293 cells. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (2 μm, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 5 min and then cultured for 1 h. The cells were then harvested and luciferase activities were measured with a luminometer using a reagent kit (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan). The background luciferase activity was subtracted from all experiments. Calcineurin Activity Assay—Calcineurin activity was assessed using Calcineurin Cellular Activity Assay kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, RII phosphopeptide (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVpSVAAE), the well known substrate for calcineurin, was used as the substrate. Cortical neurons were collected 12 h after 500 μm glutamate treatment for 15 min and were then lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm EDTA, 50 μm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was incubated with RII phosphopeptide (1.64 mg/ml) in assay buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 500 nm okadaic acid with or without 10 mm EGTA. After 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by adding 100 μl GREEN™ and fluorescence was measured at 620 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). In Vivo Experiments—Male FVB/N mice (25.0-30.0 g, 9 weeks old) were housed individually on a 12-h light/dark schedule with free access to food and water. N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methional (ALLM) (20 mg/kg, Calbiochem) was injected 30 min prior to kainite (KA, TOCRIS Cookson Inc., Ballwin, MO) injection and injected once a day for five consecutive days. After intraperitoneal (ip) administration of KA (20 mg/kg), mice were continuously monitored for seizure activity for 2 h. For Western blotting analysis, the hippocampi were obtained from the KA-injected mice 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after KA injection. Nissl staining was performed as described previously (28Moriwaki A. Lu Y.F. Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, the brains of the KA-injected mice were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight. The fixed brains were embedded in paraffin by following a standard procedure. Thirty-micrometer sections were cut coronally with a microtome at the level of the dorsal hippocampus and then stained with 1% Nissl. In Vitro Proteolysis of CnA by Calpain—Cleavage of calcineurin by calpain was analyzed by a modified procedure as described previously (29Tallant E.A. Brumley L.M. Wallace R.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2205-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Purified bovine calcineurin (1 μm, Calbiochem) was incubated with 1 μm recombinant m-calpain (Calbiochem) in a reaction buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 μm calmodulin at 30 °C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by an addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the reaction mixtures were then loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The cleavage of calcineurin was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. Mass Spectrometry—Standard peptides, angiotensin III, and oxidized insulin B chain were obtained from Sigma. For MALDI-TOF/MS analysis, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Wako, Osaka, Japan) was used as a matrix. The water used for all experiments was obtained from a MilliQ UV plus water purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Sequencing-grade unmodified trypsin, Glu-C, and Asp-N were obtained from Roche Diagnostics, Lys-C was from Wako, and n-octyl glucoside was obtained from Dojin (Kumamoto, Japan). In-gel Digestion—Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands were destained by soaking the gel pieces in a mixture of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile. Then, the gel pieces were vigorously shaken with 400 μl of methanol/water/acetic acid = 50:40:10 (MWA) for 30 min as a washing step. After four replacements of MWA, the gel pieces were soaked with 400 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate solution for 5 min, then with 400 μl of acetonitrile for 5 min, and dried completely in a Speedvac evaporator (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). The dried gel pieces were re-swollen in 2 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 0.02 μg of protease and 0.1% n-octyl glucoside. Then, 30 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate was further added and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight. After incubation, the digested peptides were extracted twice with 30 μl of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid = 50:25:0.1 by sonication for 15 min. The combined extracts were dried in a Speedvac. MALDI-TOF/MS—The dried peptides were redissolved in 5 μl of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid = 95:5:0.1 and a 0.5-μl aliquot was used for MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. Matrix solution was prepared by saturating 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid = 33:67:0.1 and 4-fold-diluted before being mixed with the peptide solution. Preparation of co-crystals was done by applying 0.5 μl of the peptide solution and 0.5 μl of the diluted matrix solution together on the same spot on a MALDI plate and allowing the mixture to dry at room temperature. MALDI-TOF/MS spectra were obtained from a Voyager linear DE or oMALDI-QSTAR pulsar I instrument (Applied Biosystems) operated in delayed-extraction mode. The spectra were calibrated using internal standards, angiotensin III, and oxidized insulin B chain. Statistical Analysis—Values are reported as the mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using either the Student's t test to compare the two conditions or the Scheffe's post hoc analysis following two-way ANOVA to compare the multiple conditions, and a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Calpain-mediated Cleavage of CnA in Glutamate- and Kainate-treated Cultures of Primary Cortical Neurons—To demonstrate whether calcineurin is involved in neuronal excitotoxicity, we investigated the expressional changes of calcineurin in cultures of primary cortical neurons during glutamate and KA excitotoxicity. In glutamate-exposed neurons, interestingly, we detected two or three truncated products of CnA by Western blotting analysis using anti-CnA antibodies recognizing the amino acid residues from 264 to 283 of human CnA (Fig. 1A). The cleavage bands appeared 30 min after a 15-min application of 500 μm glutamate, and the expression gradually increased in a time-dependent manner. The truncated products of CnA were clearly observed until 24 h after glutamate exposure (Fig. 1A). In contrast, no expression of the cleaved CnB was detected in glutamate-treated neurons (data not shown). Calpain is activated under extreme conditions that result from a sustained elevation of the cytosolic calcium levels including glutamate insult (30Siman R. Noszek J.C. Kegerise C. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1579-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31White B.C. Sullivan J.M. DeGracia D.J. O'Neil B.J. Neumar R.W. Grossman L.I. Rafols J.A. Krause G.S. J. Neurol. Sci. 2000; 179: 1-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that calpain might be involved in the cleavage of CnA and tested the effect of ALLM, a selective inhibitor of calpain, on the glutamate-induced cleavage of CnA. Pretreatment with ALLM (25 μm) completely inhibited the cleavage 3 and 24 h after glutamate exposure in neurons (Fig. 1A). To elucidate whether calpain activity was actually induced in glutamate-exposed neurons, we examined the expression of cleaved non-erythroid α-spectrin, a 240-kDa protein and a well defined physiological substrate of calpain (14Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamate exposure induced the cleavage of α-spectrin into the characteristic 145-kDa and 150-kDa fragments in a time-dependent manner, confirming that calpain was activated after glutamate exposure (Fig. 1B). We next examined the expression of the cleaved CnA in the KA-exposed neurons. The cleavage bands of CnA were also detected 3 and 24 h after an application of 500 μm KA for 15 min and ALLM inhibited the cleavage (Fig. 1C). As it has not been excluded that ALLM might inhibit the activity of other proteases in neurons, we examined the inhibitory effect of a cell membrane-permeable calpastatin peptide (11R-CS; 32Wu H-Y. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Lu Y-F. Li S-T. Matsui H. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 47: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) on the KA-induced cleavage of CnA. The 11R-CS is composed of calpastatin peptides (CS), a 27-residue peptide encoded by Exon 1B of human calpastatin, and a specific calpain inhibitor (17Chen M. He H. Zhan S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C.

Terada H. Matsui H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 15: 6000-6007Crossref Google Scholar, 27Takenobu T. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Li S-T. Moriwaki A. Lu Y-F. Matsui H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1043-1049PubMed Google Scholar). The 11R-CS blocked the expressions of the cleaved CnA and the two characteristic fragments of α-spectrin 3 and 24 h after KA exposure for 15 min (Fig. 1C). As a negative control of the peptides, a scramble peptide (11R-CS-R) with an identical amino acid composition and a random sequence was employed and found to have no inhibitory effect on the cleavage of both CnA and α-spectrin (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results may suggest that calpain is activated and mediates the cleavage of CnA in primary cultured neurons during glutamate/KA-induced neuroexcitotoxicity. To demonstrate whether calpain-mediated cleavage of CnA by prolonged glutamate or KA application in cultured neurons is physiologically significant, we compared calpain-sensitive cleavage of CnA versus cabin-1, which has previously been shown to play a role in calcineurin activation and calcium-mediated cell death (18Kim M.J. Jo D.G. Hong G.S. Kim B.J. Lai M. Cho D.H. Kim K.W. Bandyopadhyay A. Hong Y.M. Kim D.H. Cho C. Liu J.O. Snyder S.H. Jung Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9870-9875Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In cultured neurons, the expression of full-length cabin-1 was decreased at 3 and 24 h by 15-min application of either glutamate (500 μm) or KA (500 μm) (Fig. 2A, a), and ALLM inhibited the reduction of the expression of full-length cabin-1 (Fig. 2A, b). We compared the quantitative cleavage of cabin-1 and CnA in response to glutamate/KA excitotoxicity. Quantitative assay of the relative expression revealed that both full-length cabin-1 and CnA decreased at the similar degree (full-length cabin-1, glutamate, 70.67% at 3 h, 45.57% at 24 h; KA, 56.16% at 3h, 18.36% at 24 h (Fig. 2B); full-length CnA, glutamate, 72.42% at 3 h, 42.42% at 24 h; KA, 48.88% at 3h, 27.31% at 24 h (Fig. 2C)). This result may suggest that calpain-mediated cleavage of CnA is physiologically as relevant to glutamate/KA-induced neuroexcitotoxicity as calpain-mediated cleavage of cabin-1. Present results showed that glutamate exposure induced the cleavage of CnA but the cleavage was partial (Fig. 1). To investigate whether the partial cleavage of CnA influence the calcineurin activity in neurons, calcineurin activity in cultured neurons during glutamate excitotoxicity was examined in vitro. There was no change in calcineurin activity between control neurons and glutamate exposed neurons in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2D, control, 0.34 ± 0.03; glutamate (Glu.), 0.39 ± 0.04, n = 4 each). Interestingly, calcineurin activity in glutamate-treated neurons was significantly higher than that of control neurons in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2D, control, 0.03 ± 0.003; glutamate (Glu.), 0.21 ± 0.007, n = 4 each, p < 0.05). These results may suggest that the partial cleavage of CnA after glutamate treatment induced Ca2+-independent calcineurin activity but not the Ca2+-dependent activity. Calpain-mediated Truncations of CnA in Vitro and Determination of the Cleavage Sites—To examine whether calpain cleaved CnA, we digested purified calcineurin with recombinant m-calpain under various conditions in vitro (Fig. 3). Incubation of calcineurin with recombinant m-calpain for 1 h at 30 °C led to the complete digestion of full-length CnA as determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 3A) and Western blotting analysis (Fig. 3B). The cleaved sites depended on the presence of calmodulin. One truncation product of CnA with an apparent molecular mass of ∼45 kDa was generated in the absence of calmodulin (black arrow in Fig. 3, A and B), whereas one more truncation product of CnA with a molecular mass of ∼48 kDa appeared in the presence of calmodulin (black arrowhead in Fig. 3, A and B). To clarify whether calpain-dependent cleavage sites of CnA were calmodulin-dependent or whether calmodulin only delayed the cleavage of CnA, we investigated the time-dependent cleavage of CnA by m-calpain in the presence of calmodulin (Fig. 3C). CnA was immediately cleaved by calpain within 30 s (Fig."

The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, which acts through inhibition of collagen degradation, is synthesized by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) in response to fibrogenic substances. The capacity of leptin to induce TIMP-1 and its signaling molecules were investigated in a human HSC cell line, LX-2. Leptin stimulated TIMP-1 protein, mRNA, and promoter activity. JAK1 and -2, as well as STAT3 and -5, were activated. After leptin, there was increased expression of tyrosine 1141-phosphorylated leptin receptor, which may contribute to STAT3 activation. AG 490, a JAK inhibitor, blocked JAK phosphorylation with concomitant inhibition of STAT activation, TIMP-1 mRNA expression, and promoter activity. Leptin also induced an oxidative stress, which was inhibited by AG 490, indicating a JAK mediation process. ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 were activated, which was prevented by catalase, indicating an H2O2-dependent mechanism. Catalase treatment resulted in total suppression of TIMP-1 mRNA expression and promoter activity. SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, prevented p38 activation and reduced TIMP-1 message half-life with down-regulation of TIMP-1 mRNA. These changes were reproduced by overexpression of the dominant negative p38α and p38β mutants. PD098059, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, opposed ERK1/2 activation and TIMP-1 promoter activity, leading to TIMP-1 mRNA down-regulation. Thus, leptin has a direct action on liver fibrogenesis by stimulating TIMP-1 production in activated HSC. This process appears to be mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway via the leptin receptor long form and the H2O2-dependent p38 and ERK1/2 pathways via activated JAK.

These findings implicated leptin as a mediator in the development of liver fibrosis but did not elucidate the mechanisms and cell types involved.

Hepatol. 2002; 36: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that ERK1/2 mediates TIMP-1 production in liver myofibroblasts in response to oncostatin M, which is, like leptin, a member of the interleukin-6 cytokine family that signals through class I cytokine receptors. These findings raise the possibility that leptin may stimulate TIMP-1 production, using the H2O2-dependent p38 and ERK1/2 signal transduction pathways via JAK activation.Specifically, our aims were to assess whether the fibrogenic actions of leptin involve the induction of TIMP-1 in the LX-2 cell line-derived human HSC, the principal cells that mediate hepatic fibrogenesis (42Friedman S.L.

In these experiments, LX-2 cells were used from passages 20 to 30.Rat Hepatic Stellate Cells—HSCs were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics until subconfluence as previously described (39Cao Q. Mak K.M. Lieber C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1051-G1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized, subcultured, and used 3 days later (as passage 1). Animal experimental procedures followed the National Research Council's recommendations for animal care and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.TIMP-l mRNA Analysis by Northern Blot—Total cellular RNA was extracted from HSCs and used for Northern blot analysis as previously described (24Cao Q. Mak K.M. Lieber C.S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2002; 139: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A cDNA probe for human TIMP-l or β-actin was labeled with [32P]dCTP, using a random priming DNA labeling kit. Levels of mRNA were quantified by measuring the intensity of the bands on x-ray film, using the Evaluating Image Analysis Systems MCID™ (Imaging Research, Inc., St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada).TIMP-l Protein Assay—TIMP-l in culture media of LX-2 cells and rat HSC was quantified by ELISA, using the Quantikine Human TIMP-1 ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. The absorbance was determined at 450 nm in an ELISA reader. Data were calculated against a standard curve and adjusted to nanograms/ml culture medium.JAK and STAT Phosphorylation Assays—Whole cell lysates were extracted on ice using a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaC12, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteinase inhibitor mixture was added to the buffer. The content was sonicated for 2 s to shear the DNA to reduce its viscosity, followed by centrifugation. The supernatants (200 μl) were incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p-JAK1, p-JAK2, p-STAT1, p-STAT3, or pSTAT5 and then immobilized to agarose hydrazide beads by incubating overnight with gentle rocking at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed in the lysis buffer. A 20-μl sample was boiled for 5 min, cooled on ice, and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by transblotting to a nitrocellulose membrane. After an overnight incubation with the respective primary antibodies (1:500 or 1:1000) at 4 °C, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG (1:1000). Equal protein loading was controlled by immunoblotting of the corresponding nonphosphorylated JAK1, JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5, using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the respective proteins. Immunoreactive proteins were revealed with Immun-Star Enhancer and Immun-Star Substrate (1:100) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and then exposed to x-ray film. Signal intensities were analyzed using the Evaluating Image Analyzing System MCID.Oxidative Stress Assessment—Oxidative stress was assessed as previously described using fluorescent probes (42Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The amount of fluorescence was determined in a spectrofluorometer.H2O2Generation—Intracellular H2O2 was assessed by adding 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate to LX-2 culture at a final concentration of 20 μm. The generation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate is proportional to the H2O2 produced. DCF fluorescence was measured at 488 nm for excitation and 525 for emission.Superoxide Anion O2˙- Generation—This was determined by the addition of hydroethidine to LX-2 culture at a final concentration of 10 μm. Hyrothidine is oxidized by O2˙- produced by the cells. Hence, the loss of fluorescence is proportional to the amount of superoxide generated. Hydroethidine fluorescence was measured at 352 nm for excitation and 434 nm for emission.Lipid Peroxidation—This was assessed by the addition of cis-parinaric acid to LX-2 culture at a final concentration of 5 μm. Subsequent to peroxidative stress, cis-parinaric acid is degraded, resulting in decreased intensity. The loss of fluorescence is proportional to lipid peroxidation. The cis-parinaric acid fluorescence was measured at 325 nm for excitation and 413 nm for emission.Reduced Glutathione Measurement—GSH levels in LX-2 cells were determined, using the Cayman's GSH assay kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. p38 and ERKI/2 MAPK Phosphorylation Assays—These were performed by Western blots, using the components provided in the PhosphoPlus p38 MAPK and ERKl/2 MAPK antibody kits as previously described (39Cao Q.

ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected using the rabbit polyclonal phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody. The antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) was used as the secondary antibody. Equal protein loading was controlled by immunoblotting of corresponding nonphosphorylated p38 or ERK1/2 proteins. Immunoreactive proteins on the blots were visualized using the LumiGLO chemiluminescent reagents and then exposed to x-ray film. Signal intensities were quantified with the Evaluating Image Analysis System MCID. p38 Kinase Activity Assay—This was performed by the detection of phosphorylation of activating transcription factor (ATF)-2, a substrate of p38, using the p38 MAP Kinase Assay kit as described previously (39Cao Q. Mak K.M. Lieber C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1051-G1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates (200 μl) were immunoprecipitated with a 20-μl aliquot of monoclonal phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) antibody immobilized to agarose beads. The immunoprecipitated pellet was incubated with 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein in the presence of 100 μm ATP and 50 μl of kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C.

https://openalex.org/W1994418770,"Proteasome inhibitor PS-341 is one of the most promising novel agents against multiple myeloma (MM). We have previously shown that PS-341 inhibits IL-6 triggered phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 (also known as p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases) in MM cells. In this study, we further examined whether clinically achievable concentrations of PS-341 could inhibit IL-6 triggered signaling cascades in MM. We found that PS-341 inhibited not only ERK, but also signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 3 as well as Akt phosphorylation. Since gp130 (CD130) dimerizes and is phosphorylated after IL-6 binding to gp80 (IL-6 receptor), we hypothesized that gp130 could be involved in PS-341-induced blockade of signaling cascades mediating MM cell growth, survival, and drug resistance in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. In this study, we first demonstrate that PS-341 induces downregulation of gp130 in a time- and dose-dependent manner in vitro, prior to MM cell death. Conversely, downregulation of gp130 is completely abrogated by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, suggesting that downregulation of gp130 is mediated via caspase activation. Z-VAD-FMK also abrogates the inhibitory effect of PS-341 on IL-6-triggered signaling cascades. Importantly, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of ERK, STAT3, and Akt in MM.1S cells induced by either exogenous IL-6 or by binding of MM cells to BM stromal cells is abrogated by PS-341. These studies, therefore, define another novel mechanism whereby PS-341 can overcome the growth and survival advantage in MM cells conferred by the BM milieu. Importantly, this effect on cytokine-induced gp130 signaling cascades may account, at least in part, for the remarkable preclinical sensitivity and clinical responses achieved in MM with PS-341 treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2028929568,"The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), comprising CDK9 and cyclin T, stimulates transcription of cellular and viral genes by phosphorylating RNA polymerase II. A major portion of nuclear P-TEFb is sequestered and inactivated by the coordinated actions of the 7SK snRNA and the HEXIM1 protein, whose induced dissociation from P-TEFb is crucial for stress-induced transcription and pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. The 7SK·P-TEFb interaction, which can occur independently of HEXIM1 and does not by itself inhibit P-TEFb, recruits HEXIM1 for P-TEFb inactivation. To study the control of this interaction, we established an in vitro system that reconstituted the specific interaction of P-TEFb with 7SK but not other snRNAs. Using this system, together with an in vivo binding assay, we show that the phosphorylation of CDK9, on possibly the conserved Thr-186 in the T-loop, was crucial for the 7SK·P-TEFb interaction. This phosphorylation was not caused by CDK9 autophosphorylation or the general CDK-activating kinase CAK, but rather by a novel HeLa nuclear kinase. Furthermore, the stress-induced disruption of the 7SK·P-TEFb interaction was not caused by any prohibitive changes in 7SK but by the dephosphorylation of P-TEFb, leading to the loss of the key phosphorylation important for 7SK binding. Thus, the phosphorylated P-TEFb is tagged for inhibition through association with 7SK. We discuss the implications of this mechanism in controlling P-TEFb activity during normal and stress-induced transcription.

P-TEFb also functions as a specific host cellular cofactor for the HIV-1 Tat protein. Stimulation of Pol II elongation is essential for HIV transcription, during which P-TEFb is recruited to the nascent mRNA by Tat (15Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol.

Tat binds to CycT1 and recruits P-TEFb through formation of a stable ternary complex containing P-TEFb, Tat, and the HIV TAR RNA structure located at the 5′-end of the nascent viral transcript. Once recruited, P-TEFb phosphorylates the CTD and stimulates the production of the full-length HIV-1 transcripts. It is important to point out that not all forms of P-TEFb in the cell can display transcriptional activity. In fact, at least half of P-TEFb in HeLa cells are sequestered in the 7SK snRNP, where their kinase and transcriptional activities are suppressed (6Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O.

Cell. 2003; 12: 971-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, renamed as MAQ1 in 18Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). HEXIM1 has previously been identified as a nuclear protein whose expression is rapidly induced in cells treated with hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) (19Ouchida R. Kusuhara M. Shimizu N. Hisada T. Makino Y. Morimoto C. Handa H. Ohsuzu F. Tanaka H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), a potent inducer of cell differentiation (20Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Int. J. Hematol. 1996; 63: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While the binding of 7SK to P-TEFb can occur in the absence of HEXIM1, the binding of HEXIM1 to P-TEFb is strictly 7SK-dependent (17Yik J.H.N. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 7SK binding alone is not sufficient to inhibit P-TEFb. P-TEFb is inhibited by HEXIM1 in a process that specifically requires 7SK for bridging the HEXIM1·P-TEFb interaction. This allows HEXIM1 to inhibit transcription both in vivo and in vitro (17Yik J.H.N. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The amount of the HEXIM1/7SK-bound P-TEFb does not remain unchanged. In fact, treatment of cells with several stress-inducing agents rapidly releases 7SK and HEXIM1 from P-TEFb (6Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 7Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 17Yik J.H.N. Chen R.

Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These agents have been shown to stimulate CTD phosphorylation and HIV transcription (21Valerie K. Delers A. Bruck C. Thiriart C. Rosenberg H. Debouck C. Rosenberg M. Nature. 1988; 333: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Casse C. Giannoni F. Nguyen V.T. Dubois M.-F. Bensaude O. J. Biol.

Thus, the induced release of 7SK/HEXIM1 and activation of P-TEFb may contribute directly to the stress-induced HIV and cellular gene expression. The activation of P-TEFb through release of 7SK also contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy, a disease characterized by the enlargement of cardiac myocytes due to a global increase in RNA and protein contents. P-TEFb activity is limiting for normal cardiac growth. Hypertrophic signals induce the dissociation of 7SK (presumably also HEXIM1) from P-TEFb, activating P-TEFb to stimulate Pol II transcription (23Sano M. Schneider M.D. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Sano M. Abdellatif M. Oh H. Xie M. Bagella L. Giordano A. Michael L.H. DeMayo F.J. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Given the importance of the 7SK·P-TEFb interaction in recruiting HEXIM1 for P-TEFb inactivation, we would like to understand how this interaction is regulated. This will aid the future elucidation of the signaling pathways that control the formation and disruption of the 7SK snRNP in response to physiological stimuli. Here, we report the establishment of an in vitro system that reconstituted the specific 7SK·P-TEFb interaction. Our data reveal that the phosphorylation of CDK9, on possibly the conserved Thr-186 in the T-loop, was crucial for this interaction. This phosphorylation was not caused by CDK9 autophosphorylation or the general CDK-activating kinase CAK, but rather by a yet-to-be-identified HeLa nuclear kinase. Finally, the stress-induced dissociation of 7SK from P-TEFb was not caused by any changes or modifications in 7SK but rather by the dephosphorylation of P-TEFb, resulting in the loss of the key phosphorylation important for 7SK binding. In Vitro Reconstitution of 7SK·P-TEFb Interaction—The reconstitution was performed in two main steps. During the immunoprecipitation step, 250 μg of nuclear extract (NE) prepared from either F1C2 (an engineered HeLa cell line stably expressing FLAG-tagged CDK9) (7Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) or HeLa cells (as a negative control) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 10 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma). After binding, the beads were washed extensively with buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.3 m KCl (D0.3M), then buffer D0.8M, and finally D0.1M. The second wash with D0.8M stripped 7SK and HEXIM1 off P-TEFb. After virtually all the liquid was removed, the beads were preblocked at room temperature for 30 min with 15–20 μl of a blocking solution containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mg/ml poly(C) (Amersham Biosciences), and 2.5 mg/ml Escherichia coli tRNA. During the reconstitution step, the preblocked beads were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 100 μg of HeLa NE in buffer D0.1M plus 0.5 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2 or 100 μg of HeLa NE depleted of the endogenous ATP by treatment with hexokinase and glucose (25Zamore P.D. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2000; 101: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the incubation, the beads were washed extensively with buffer D0.4M and then D0.1M. The reconstituted 7SK snRNP was finally eluted off the beads with 0.4 mg/ml of FLAG peptide (Sigma) prepared in D0.1M. RNA used in the specified reconstitution reactions was transcribed in vitro from a 7SK DNA template by T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) or extracted from HeLa NE or the D0.8M-stripped 7SK fraction with phenol and chloroform. After precipitation with ethanol, the RNA pellet was dissolved in D0.1M. Phosphatase Treatment of Immobilized P-TEFb—After washing away nonspecific factors with D0.3M, the immobilized 7SK(+) P-TEFb was washed with 90 mm sodium citrate and incubated with 0.3 units of PAPP (potato acid phosphatase, Sigma) in 50 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 45 min, the complex was washed with D0.3M and then eluted by Flag peptide. For treatment of the immobilized 7SK/HEXIM1-free P-TEFb with PP1 (type 1 protein phosphatase, NEB), the D0.8M-stripped P-TEFb was washed with the PP1 solution (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm MnCl2) and then incubated at 30 °C with 12.5 units of PP1 in 20 μl for 45 min. After washing with D0.3M, the dephosphorylated P-TEFb was used in the reconstitution reactions. Affinity Purification of CDK9, CycT1, and Their Associated Factors for Northern and Western Analyses—FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant CDK9 and CycT1 and their associated factors were isolated by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation from NE of transfected HeLa cells. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the immunoprecipitates were washed with D0.3M. The FLAG peptide-eluted materials were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-CDK9, and anti-CycT1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Northern blotting using the full-length 7SK antisense RNA as a probe. In Vitro Kinase Reactions—P-TEFb containing wild-type or mutant CDK9-FLAG were immunoprecipitated from NE of transfected HeLa cells, washed with D0.8M to remove the associated 7SK and HEXIM1, and eluted with FLAG peptide prepared in D0.1M. The kinase reactions contained P-TEFb, 1 μg of immobilized GST-CTD, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm cold ATP, and 1 μl of [γ-P32]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and were incubated at 30 °C for 25 min in 20-μl volume. The phosphorylated GST-CTD was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Treatment of Cells with Drugs—The HeLa-based F1C2 cells (3 × 106) expressing CDK9-FLAG (7Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) were seeded in 15-cm dishes 1 day before the treatment. 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazol (DRB) (100 μm), H7 (100 μm), staurosporine (0.5 μm), and actinomycin D (1.2 μg/ml) were added to the culture medium for 1 h. NE was prepared from the treated cells and subjected to further analysis. Phosphorylation-dependent Interaction of 7SK with P-TEFb— To investigate the mechanism controlling the 7SK·P-TEFb interaction, we asked whether protein phosphorylation might play a role in this process. Previously, it has been shown that treatment of HeLa cells with the kinase inhibitor DRB causes a rapid dissociation of 7SK from P-TEFb (6Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). To determine whether other kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine and H7 (1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine) would produce a similar effect, a HeLa-based cell line (F1C2) stably expressing CDK9-FLAG (7Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) was treated with DRB, staurosporine, H7, or the control solvent Me2SO (DMSO). CDK9-FLAG and its associated CycT1 and 7SK were immunoprecipitated from the NE of the treated cells and analyzed by Western and Northern blotting. All three kinase inhibitors significantly weakened the binding of 7SK to P-TEFb without affecting the CycT1-CDK9 interaction or the steady state levels of CDK9, CycT1, and 7SK in NE (Fig. 1A), suggesting that a protein phosphorylation event may be crucial in promoting the binding of 7SK to P-TEFb. To determine whether a direct phosphorylation of a component of the 7SK·P-TEFb complex is required for this binding, we incubated the immobilized 7SK-bound P-TEFb with PAPP. While the CycT1-CDK9 interaction remained unaffected, 7SK was dissociated from P-TEFb following the incubation with PAPP and the subsequent washes (Fig. 1B, left panel). This effect was blocked by phosphatase inhibitors (data not shown). The PAPP preparation was free of any RNases and did not degrade 7SK when incubated with the peptide-eluted 7SK·P-TEFb complex in solution (Fig. 1B, right panel). Together, these in vivo and in vitro data implicate the phosphorylation of a component of the 7SK-bound P-TEFb as important for the binding of 7SK to P-TEFb. Requirement of Both CDK9 and CycT1 Subunits but Not CycT1 Phosphorylation for 7SK·P-TEFb Binding—CDK9 and CycT1 are both phosphoproteins, and CycT1 is phosphorylated by CDK9 in the C-terminal half (26Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the phosphorylation of CycT1 is important for the 7SK·P-TEFb binding, a C-terminally truncated CycT1-(1–333)-FLAG lacking all the phosphorylation sites (26Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was analyzed for its binding to CDK9 and 7SK in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates derived from NE of transfected HeLa cells. To test the contribution of CDK9 to the 7SK·P-TEFb binding, two additional CycT1 mutants 1–254 and 2M were also analyzed (Fig. 2A). Wild-type CycT1 and its two C-terminal deletion mutants 1–333 and 1–254 all contained an intact cyclin-box, and as expected, were able to bind to CDK9 (Fig. 2B). Although 1–333 was expressed to a higher level than wild-type CycT1 and 1–254 based on per microgram of DNA transfected, a similar level of CDK9 was found to co-precipitate with all three CycT1 molecules, indicating the formation of a similar amount of the CycT1/CDK9 heterodimers (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions, 7SK bound strongly to the P-TEFb containing either wild-type CycT1 or 1–333 but not 1–254. Thus, a region between amino acids 255 and 333, which is C-terminal to the Tat/TAR recognition motif (TRM) (28Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), contributed to 7SK·P-TEFb binding. However, the C-terminal phosphorylation of CycT1 after residue 334 was clearly dispensable for the binding. Finally, unlike the HIV TAR RNA, which can interact with only the monomeric CycT1 in conjunction with Tat (9Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 28Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), 7SK appeared to require also CDK9 for binding to the CycT1/CDK9 heterodimer. For example, the mutant CycT1(2M), with Lys-93 changed to Leu and Glu-96 to Lys within the cyclin-box, bound to neither CDK9 (29Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7791-7796Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) nor 7SK (Fig. 2B). Requirement of Conserved Thr-186 in CDK9 T-loop for in Vivo 7SK·P-TEFb Binding—Since CDK molecules have built-in structural flexibility that is most often controlled by phosphorylation (30Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 31Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar), we next investigated the requirement of CDK9 phosphorylation for the 7SK·P-TEFb binding. A group of Ser/Thr residues, located near the CDK9 C terminus in a region not conserved with other CDKs, are phosphorylated when CDK9 undergoes autophosphorylation (27Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This induces a conformational change in P-TEFb critical for the formation of the P-TEFb·Tat·TAR complex (26Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As a member of the CDK family, the activity and conformation of CDK9 are also affected by phosphorylation on other amino acids, which are conserved among several or all CDK family members (31Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of a conserved threonine (Thr-186 in CDK9) located at the tip of a flexible loop (the T-loop) in all CDKs is known to induce a major movement of the loop and allow the access to the catalytic center by the substrate (32Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a conserved Ser residue in the T-loops of CDK7 (Ser-164) and CDK9 (Ser-175) can also be phosphorylated (33Martinez A.M. Afshar M. Martin F. Cavadore J.C. Labbe J.C. Doree M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Larochelle S. Chen J. Knights R. Pandur J. Morcillo P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Suter B. Fisher R.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Next, FLAG-tagged CDK9 mutants containing point mutations at these phosphorylation sites were analyzed for their interactions with 7SK and CycT1 in transfected HeLa cells. Unlike the binding of P-TEFb to Tat/TAR, which requires the phosphorylation of several Ser/Thr residues near the CDK9 C terminus (27Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6958-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), substitution of 4 (C4S/T-A: Ser-347, Ser-353, Thr-354, and Ser-357) or 8 (C8S/T-A: Ser-329, Thr-330, Thr-333, Ser-334, Ser-347, Thr-350, Ser-353, and Thr-354) Ser/Thr in and around this region with Ala had no or only minor effect on CDK9 binding to 7SK and CycT1 (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the Ser-175 to Ala (S175A) mutation in the T-loop only slightly decreased the binding to 7SK, which was fully restored when Ser-175 was changed to Asp (S175D). In contrast, mutation of Thr-186 to either Ala (T186A) or Glu (T186E) completely abolished the binding to 7SK, although neither mutation significantly affected the CycT1-CDK9 interaction. Thus, among all the known phosphorylation sites in CDK9, Thr-186 was the only one essential for the 7SK·P-TEFb binding. Since this conserved threonine is invariably phosphorylated in all activated CDKs, the phosphorylation-dependent 7SK·P-TEFb binding could potentially be attributed to the phosphorylation of Thr-186. The Phosphorylation Critical for 7SK·P-TEFb Binding Is Not Caused by CDK9 Autophosphorylation—We next performed kinase reactions to examine whether the T-loop mutations could affect P-TEFb ability to phosphorylate GST-CTD. Prior to the reactions, the immunoprecipitated CycT1/CDK9-FLAG were washed with a high salt (0.8 m KCl) buffer, which removed the associated 7SK and HEXIM1 without disrupting the CycT1-CDK9 binding (see below). In kinase reactions, the T186A, T186E, and S175A mutations all inactivated P-TEFb, whereas S175D fully restored P-TEFb kinase activity (Fig. 2D), revealing a requirement for a negatively charged amino acid at position 175. More importantly, the ability of S175A to inactivate the P-TEFb kinase without significantly affecting P-TEFb binding to 7SK suggests that the CDK9 kinase activity is not required for the binding. This notion was further supported by the observation that another P-TEFb complex containing the D167N mutant CDK9 was completely inactive as a kinase (Fig. 2D), but fully capable of binding to 7SK (Fig. 2E). Moreover, as with the wild-type 7SK-bound P-TEFb, treatment of the D167N-containing complex with phosphatase also released 7SK (Fig. 2F), indicating that phosphorylation was required for this kinase-defective P-TEFb to bind to 7SK. Because D167N cannot phosphorylate itself or any associated proteins, it is possible that the phosphorylation, possibly on Thr-186, was caused by another unrelated kinase. This issue will be revisited later. In Vitro Reconstitution of the 7SK·P-TEFb Interaction—To further study the control of the 7SK·P-TEFb interaction, we decided to reconstitute this interaction in vitro. Since CDK9 phosphorylation has been implicated as critical for the interaction, we tried to assemble the 7SK·P-TEFb complex from P-TEFb that had acquired the key phosphorylation in vivo. We took advantage of an observation (35Shore S.M. Byers S.A. Maury W. Price D.H. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 307: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that 7SK could be washed off the immobilized P-TEFb with buffers containing greater than 0.6 m KCl (e.g. 0.8 m KCl in buffer D0.8M), whereas the CycT1/CDK9-FLAG dimer was mostly unaffected and remained tightly bound to the beads (Fig. 3A). HEXIM1, which bound to P-TEFb through 7SK, was also stripped off P-TEFb by the same D0.8M buffer (17Yik J.H.N. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The 7SK/HEXIM1-free P-TEFb thus obtained was then incubated with HeLa NE, protein-free total RNA extracted from NE, purified native 7SK RNA or heat-denatured (Δ) 7SK to reconstitute the 7SK·P-TEFb interaction (Fig. 3B). The purified 7SK was from a fraction (termed 7SK fraction) that was stripped off the immobilized P-TEFb by buffer D0.8M (Fig. 3B). After the incubation and washing with buffer D0.4M, the reconstituted 7SK·P-TEFb complex was eluted with FLAG peptide and analyzed by Western and Northern blotting. The control reactions in lanes 6–10, Fig. 3C used HeLa NE in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation, which retained no P-TEFb on the beads. Compared with these reactions, the 7SK-free CycT1/CDK9-FLAG derived from F1C2 NE interacted with 7SK from all four sources (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–5), which contained a similar level of 7SK (lanes 11–14). Even the heat-denatured 7SK interacted with P-TEFb, probably because the RNA quickly adopted an active conformation once in the reaction. Thus, no additional protein from HeLa NE was required for the reconstituted 7SK·P-TEFb interaction. Dependence on Thr-186 for Reconstituted 7SK·P-TEFb Interaction—To test the specificity of the reconstituted 7SK·P-TEFb interaction, we examined whether Thr-186 in the CDK9 T-loop was required. P-TEFb containing wild-type or mutant (T186A or D167N) CDK9-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from the transfected HeLa cells and then washed with D0.8M to remove 7SK/HEXIM1. While both wild-type and the D167N P-TEFb bound to 7SK present in total RNA and HeLa NE, the T186A P-TEFb failed (Fig. 4A). Thus, like the situation in vivo (Fig. 2E), Thr-186 was also required for the 7SK·P-TEFb binding in vitro. Moreover, a Thr-186-dependent binding could be detected between P-TEFb and the in vitro transcribed 7SK by T7 RNA polymerase (Fig. 4A). This binding was as efficient as the one involving the native HeLa 7SK (data not shown), ruling out a significant role of any potential 7SK modification in the binding. Specific Reconstituted Intera"

HD is associated with expansions in excess of 35 CAG repeats, which are translated into an abnormally long glutamine tract (polyQ) within htt. This is believed to confer a deleterious gain-of-function onto the protein (2Ho L.W. Carmichael J. Swartz J. Wyttenbach A. Rankin J. Rubinsztein D.C. Psychol. Med. 2001; 31: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HD belongs to a family of nine neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyQ expansions, including spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17; spinobulbar muscular atrophy; and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy.

PolyQ diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and by the formation of intraneuronal protein aggregates containing the mutant proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3Ross C.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1147-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Although the precise roles of these aggregates in the disease process are still under debate, recent findings have shown them to have a possible pathogenic role in vivo (4Sanchez I. Mahike C. Yuan J. Nature. 2003; 421: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Normally, htt is distributed predominantly within the cytoplasm, although some full-length htt and N-terminal cleavage fragments are also found in the nucleus (5Martindale D. Hackam A. Wieczorek A. Ellerby L. Wellington C. McCutcheon K. Singaraja R. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Devon R. Kim S.U. Bredesen D.F. Tufaro F. Hayden M.R. Nat.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7466-7476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For mutant htt, however, nuclear localization is increased, suggesting that transcriptional disruption may be a possible mechanism for polyQ disease pathogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 7Sugars K.L. Rubinsztein D.C. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 233-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Soluble and aggregated polyQ proteins have been shown to interact/associate with a number of transcription factors and co-factors, which in several cases results in their functional impairment (reviewed in Ref. 7Sugars K.L. Rubinsztein D.C. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 233-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). To date, most attention has fallen on disruption of the transcriptional co-activator protein cAMP response element-binding protein (CBP). CBP facilitates gene transcription under normal conditions by acting as a bridge between specific upstream transcription factors and the basal transcriptional machinery (reviewed in Refs. 8Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar and 9Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). It also possesses histone acetyltransferase activity, making it able to open up chromatin structures (reviewed in Refs. 8Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. 3rd Ed.

CBP directly interacts with mutant polyQ proteins and has been detected within aggregates in a number of polyQ diseases, including HD (10McCampbell A. Taylor J.P. Taye A.A. Robitschek J. Li M.

In particular histone deacetylase inhibitors have been shown to be protective in both Drosophila and transgenic mouse models of HD (16Steffan J.S Bodai L. Pallos J. Poelman M. McCampbell A. Apostol B.L. Kazantsev A. Schmidt E. Zhu Y.-Z. Greenwald M. Kurokawa R. Housman D.E. Jackson G.R. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M.

A. 2003; 100: 2041-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar); however, these inhibitors are imperfect as they will do more than specifically reverse the loss of CBP-dependent acetyltransferase activity. Additionally, up-regulation of endogenous CBP in Drosophila reduces both polyQ protein aggregation and neurodegeneration (18Taylor J.P. Taye A.A. Campbell C. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Fischbeck K.H. Min K.-T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), demonstrating more specifically a role for CBP disruption in the disease process. CBP is an important co-factor for several transcriptional regulatory pathways (reviewed in 8Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar and 9Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), and two of these, the cAMP response element (CRE) and retinoic acid response element (RARE) pathways have been implicated in HD. We previously reported disruption of CRE-dependent transcription in an exon 1 HD model (19Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that increasing intracellular cAMP levels with cAMP or forskolin attenuated polyQ toxicity. However, raised cAMP can signal to many other pathways, so our previous data do not conclusively demonstrate that one can modulate polyQ toxicity specifically at the level of CREB-mediated transcription. Many RARE-responsive genes have also been shown to be down-regulated in HD exon 1 transgenic mice by microarray analysis (20Luthi-Carter R. Hanson S.A. Strand A.D. Bergstrom D.A. Chun W. Peters N.L. Woods A.M. Chan E.Y. Kooperberg C. Krainc D. Young A.B. Tapscott S.J. Olson J.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1911-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), suggesting that this pathway may be impaired. However, the data of Yohrling et al. (21Yohrling G.J. IV Farrell L. A. Hollenberg A. N. Cha J.-H. J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) at a single time point in an exon 1 PC12 cell model do not support this expectation. In this study, we tested whether there was disruption to three CBP-dependent pathways, CRE, RARE, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), in an exon 1 cell model, at various time points after transgene induction. We report down-regulation of both CRE- and RARE-dependent transcription, with the CRE pathway showing by far the earliest disruption. In contrast, we find that the NF-κB pathway actually becomes activated in our exon 1 cell model. Because human HD genes are full-length, it is important to test whether changes in exon 1 models are reproduced in full-length models. Accordingly, we have developed PC12 full-length htt stable inducible cell lines and report the first transcriptional studies in such a model. A significant finding of this study is that, of the three transcriptional pathways examined in our exon 1 model, only CRE-dependent transcription shows any disruption in the full-length model, at the time points examined. Again, this disruption occurs early. As the CRE pathway represents the earliest transcriptional anomaly we see, and is pertinent to full-length mutant htt expression, we sought to test its functional relevance to disease. We report that direct activation of this pathway by the overexpression of transcriptionally active CREB is able to both reduce mutant htt aggregation and protect against cell death. The full-length htt cDNAs, containing either a wild type (17Q) or mutant (136Q) polyQ tract (kindly provided by Michael Hayden and Cheryl Wellington; University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada), were cloned into the BD Biosciences TET-inducible system using an intermediate purpose-built cloning vector, pTre2Hyg:3×FLAG. This vector is designed to express cDNAs with an N-terminal triple FLAG epitope and consists of the pTre2Hyg vector (BD Biosciences, Oxford, United Kingdom (UK)) with a PCR linker encoding a triple FLAG epitope plus additional cloning sites, within the multiple cloning site. The triple FLAG epitope sequence was amplified from the Sigma (Poole, UK) triple FLAG vector (pFLAG) using two successive rounds of PCR using primers containing MluI and NheI restriction sites. The PCR product was digested with these restriction enzymes and ligated into pTre2Hyg in a single step. Wild type and mutant htt cDNAs were excised from their parental vectors using HpaI and NotI and then ligated into NruI/NotI-digested pTre2Hyg:3×FLAG in a blunt/sticky reaction. The resulting vectors, pTre2Hyg:3×FLAG:htt 17QFL and pTre2Hyg:3×FLAG:htt 136QFL, were subsequently shown to express well using transient transfections without Tet-ON. These constructs were co-electroporated with pTK-Hyg (BD Biosciences) into PC12 Tet-ON cells (BD Biosciences) using a 10:1 molar excess of htt construct to allow selection of stably transformed cells in the presence of hygromycin (150 μg/ml). Single-cell derived colonies for each construct were isolated by ring cloning and then subjected to a further round of single-cell clonal selection by aliquoting into 96-well plates to derive new colonies. Cell morphology, background transgene expression versus doxycycline inducibility, and the presence of non-truncated forms of the transgene were assessed in all hygromycin-resistant lines. Two independent clonal lines were obtained for both the wild-type (Q17) and mutant (Q136) constructs. These were given clonal identifiers E13 or F17 for Q17 and K7 or L14 for Q136. Cells were then maintained as described (19Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All PC12-derived cell lines were cultured as described (19Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were cultured as described (22Wyttenbach A. Carmichael J. Swartz J. Furlong R.A. Narain Y. Rankin J. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2898-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol on ice for 45 min. Protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay system (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%, unless stated otherwise) and Western blotting performed as described (28Kim Y.J. Yi Y. Sapp E. Wang Y. Cuiffo B. Kegel K.B. Qin Z.-H. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12784-12789Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were 1:1000 mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma), 1:500 mouse anti-htt MAB2166 (Chemicon, Harrow, UK), 1:1000 diluted rabbit anti-phospho-CREB (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, CA), 1:1000 diluted rabbit anti-CREB (Cell Signaling Technology), 1:1000 rabbit anti-RARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), 1:1000 rabbit anti-RXRα (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), 1:2500 rabbit anti-actin (Sigma), 1:2000 mouse anti-GFP (BD Biosciences). All blots were visualized using the ECL™ detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Cells were induced with doxycycline for the appropriate time and cell death analyzed using the Oncogene™ Annexin V-Biotin apoptosis detection kit (CD Biosciences, Nottingham, UK) as per instructions from the manufacturer. Cells were measured using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur with CellQuest software. Early/late apoptotic and necrotic cells are as defined by the Oncogene™ system. PC12 stable lines were grown on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) in 6-well plates and induced for the indicated times. To determine the localization of exogenously expressed proteins, cells were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated expression vector. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described (23Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.-P. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were: 1:500 rabbit anti-CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), 1:1000 mouse anti-FLAG™ (Sigma), and 1:500 rabbit anti-RARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Secondary antibodies were Cy3-conjugated (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) secondary antibodies, which were used at 1:200. Cells were mounted in Citifluor™ (Citifluor, London, UK) containing (3 μg/ml) supplemented with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to allow visualization of nuclei. Staining was analyzed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Promoter Constructs—CRE-luciferase constructs, containing either wild type or mutant CRE consensus motifs (pGL3-CREwt/pGL3-CREmut), were generated as described (19Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RARE-TK-luciferase plasmid (containing three binding motifs for retinoid receptors) along with its empty vector control plasmid (TK-109-luciferase) were kindly provided by Henk Stunnenberg (University of Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands). The NF-κB-luciferase construct was obtained from the Mercury™ pathway profiling system (BD Biosciences), along with its empty vector control plasmid pTAL. DNA Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Two clonal lines of stably transfected PC12 lines expressing exon 1 (21.20/21.7 and 72.1b/72.8a) or full-length huntingtin (E13/F17 and K7/L14) were transfected using LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Cells were transfected in 24-well plates with 750 ng of the appropriate luciferase plasmid, along with 300 ng of a plasmid containing the gene for β-galactosidase linked to the cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMVβ, BD Biosciences). Cells were induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline at the indicated times prior to harvesting so that all cells were in culture and transfected for an identical period of time; all cells were harvested simultaneously. In the case of 6-day induced full-length lines, cells were induced 4 days prior to transfection and then transfected as above during the following 48 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter assays were performed as described (24Coles R. Caswell R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity from each well was normalized to its β-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiency. To determine the luciferase activity specifically caused by the particular transcription factors, the activities obtained from the empty vector or mutant control wells were subtracted from test wells. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Cell pellets were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 20 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min. Nuclei were then pelleted and nuclear proteins extracted in 20 mm Hepes (pH 8), 25% glycerol, 450 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h. Dialysis was then performed for 2 h and protein concentration determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were prepared from fresh mouse brains using the nuclear extract kit (Active Motif Europe, Rixensart, Belgium). Binding Assay—5 μg of total nuclear protein was analyzed for binding to a CRE consensus motif using the TransAM™ system (Active Motif Europe) for phospho-CREB. This assay employs an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based system, whereby nuclear proteins are bound to an immobilized CRE motif within a 96-well plate. The amount of phospho-CREB binding to its recognition sequence is then detected using an antibody specific to this protein followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based detection, allowing accurate quantitation. COS-7 cells were plated onto coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of a plasmid containing EGFP linked to exon 1 of htt containing 72 CAG repeats (EGFP-Q74) using LipofectAMINE™ reagent. Cotransfections were also performed either with 1 μg of the empty vector pCDNA3 or with constitutively active (pCREB) or constitutively inactive (iCREB) CREB expression vectors. The pCREB and iCREB vectors were a kind gift from Marc Montminy (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). In cells transfected with EGFP-Q74 alone, salmon sperm DNA was used in place of the expression vectors. Cells were incubated for 72 h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were washed and mounted in Citifluor supplemented with 3 μg/ml DAPI to allow visualization of nuclei. Cells were analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse E500 fluorescent microscope. PolyQ aggregation and cell death were then scored as previously described (23Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.-P. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To determine the statistical significance of changes in reporter gene activity, we employed two-tailed t-tests (Macintosh Statview™ 4.5 for Windows or SPSS 9 software). Changes in aggregate formation and cell death, assessed in multiple experiments, were calculated as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Odds ratios and p values were determined by unconditional logistical regression analysis using SPSS 9 software (25Carmichael J. Sugars K.L. Bao Y.P. Rubinsztein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33791-33798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this study we have employed stable, inducible PC12 models of HD expressing wild-type and mutant alleles, either in the context of an exon 1 fragment or the full-length protein. The advantage of these models is that we can study events without the confounds of cell death, because cell death in the mutant, mitotic lines is very low and is no higher than in the wild type lines at the time points we have assayed transcription (19Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exon 1 lines have been described and characterized previously (19Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They display both time- and polyQ length-dependent aggregate formation in cycling and differentiated cells. These aggregates stain positively for ubiquitin and associate with both proteasome and heat shock proteins (19Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Establishment of a Stable, Inducible, Full-length Cell Model of HD—To complement the exon 1 model, we have established an inducible full-length cell model of HD in the well characterized PC12 neuronal precursor cell line. These stable, inducible cell lines express the full-length htt protein, containing either 17 or 136 glutamine residues (HDFL-Q17 or HDFL-Q136), fused downstream of a triple FLAG epitope. Expression of this transgene is driven by a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter under the control of a tetracycline-responsive element and becomes induced in the presence of doxycycline (19Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We grew independent single cell clones for both the wild-type and mutant lines and, after two rounds of selection, isolated two clones of each for further analysis. These exhibited normal morphology and growth patterns, which were indistinguishable from the parental PC12 Tet-ON line, together with high transgene inducibility and low background. Specifically, inducible full-length transgene expression was detectable in both the wild-type and mutant lines by Western analysis using antibodies against either the FLAG epitope (Fig. 1A) or against the htt protein itself (Fig. 1B). We found that our cell lines expressed similar levels of endogenous and exogenous mutant htt (Fig. 1B), analogous to the heterozygous condition. In addition to the detection of the full-length protein, we also detected additional bands by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Several of these bands are compatible with those predicted for the cleavage of huntingtin, which occurs at multiple sites (26Lunkes A. Lindenberg K.S. Ben-Haiem L. Weber C. Devys D.

As with our exon 1 model, these full-length cell lines exhibited very low levels of cell death in cycling cells, which was no higher in mutant cells compared with wild-type up until 12 days after induction (Fig. 1C). The mutant polyQ HDFL-Q136 lines also exhibited time-dependent aggregate formation, in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, which reached a maximum after 6 days of induction (Figs. 1D and 5A). As expected, no aggregates were detected in the wild-type HDFL-Q17 lines in which transgene expression was predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 5A). This localization of full-length huntingtin is compatible with previous studies (reviewed in Ref. 7Sugars K.L. Rubinsztein D.C. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 233-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and is in contrast to the distribution of the exon 1 fragment, which is uniform throughout the cell (Fig. 5B), highlighting the difference in expression patterns between these two transgenes.Fig. 5Aggregate localization and their association with nuclear transcription factors in HD cell lines.A, full-length HD cell lines exhibit predominately cytoplasmic transgene expression but both nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates.

We present evidence for an equally important role of KLF4 in maintaining the integrity of the G2/M checkpoint following DNA damage. HCT116, a colon cancer cell line with wild type p53 alleles, underwent sustained G2 arrest up to 4 days after γ-irradiation. In contrast, HCT116 cells null for p53 were able to enter mitosis following irradiation. Western blot analyses of irradiated HCT116 cells showed increased levels of p53, KLF4, and p21WAF1/CIP1 and decreased levels of cyclin B1 when compared with unirradiated controls. In contrast, the levels of cyclin B1 increased in irradiated HCT116 p53-/- cells, in which KLF4 failed to increase due to the absence of p53. When KLF4 was inhibited by small interfering RNA, irradiated HCT116 cells exhibited increased mitotic indices and a rise in cyclin B1 levels. Conversely, irradiated HCT116 p53-/- cells that were infected with KLF4-expressing adenoviruses demonstrated a concurrent reduction in mitotic indices and cyclin B1 levels. In each case, Cdc2 kinase measurements showed an inverse correlation between Cdc2 kinase activities and KLF4 levels. Co-transfection experiments showed that KLF4 repressed the cyclin B1 promoter through a specific GC-rich element. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both KLF4 and HDAC were associated with the cyclin B1 promoter in irradiated HCT116 cells. We conclude that KLF4 is essential in preventing mitotic entry following γ-irradiation and does so by inhibiting cyclin B1 expression. Previous studies indicate that Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4 or GKLF) controls the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint upon DNA damage.

The eukaryotic cell cycle is divided into several phases: gap (G1), DNA replication (S), gap 2 (G2), mitosis (M), and a resting or quiescent phase (G0) (1Nurse P. Masui Y. Hartwell L. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The events in the cell cycle are ordered into dependent pathways so that late events cannot begin until early events are completed. For example, mitosis is dependent on the completion of DNA replication. Control mechanisms that enforce the dependence of the cell cycle are called checkpoints (2Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Elimination of the checkpoints may result in cell death, infidelity in the distribution of chromosomes, or increasing susceptibility to environmental perturbations such as DNA-damaging agents. There are three major checkpoints in the cell cycle: G1/S, G2/M, and mitotic or spindle checkpoints (3Murray A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 5Russell P. Trends Biochem.

Controlling the checkpoints are three families of proteins: cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), 1The abbreviations used are: Cdkcyclin-dependent kinaseChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationCkiCdk inhibitorPBSphosphate-buffered salineDPBSDulbecco's phosphate-buffered salineFBSfetal bovine serumGKLFgut-enriched Krüppel-like factorHDAChistone deacetylaseKLF4Krüppel-like factor 4siRNAsmall interfering RNATSAtrichostatin AGygray(s)ntnucleotide(s)GFPgreen fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: Cdkcyclin-dependent kinaseChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationCkiCdk inhibitorPBSphosphate-buffered salineDPBSDulbecco's phosphate-buffered salineFBSfetal bovine serumGKLFgut-enriched Krüppel-like factorHDAChistone deacetylaseKLF4Krüppel-like factor 4siRNAsmall interfering RNATSAtrichostatin AGygray(s)ntnucleotide(s)GFPgreen fluorescent protein. and inhibitors of Cdk (Cki) (6Murray A.W.

In response to DNA damage such as that caused by ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, cells are arrested at the transition from G1 to S phase and G2 to M phase (10Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2626) Google Scholar, 11Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 12Smith A.P.

Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Arrest in these checkpoints prevents DNA replication and mitosis in the presence of chromosomal alterations. The tumor suppressor, p53, plays a pivotal role in controlling both the G1/S and G2/M transitions following DNA damage (14Perry M.E. Levine A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

Upon its activation by upstream mediators, p53 transcriptionally induces a Cki, p21WAF1/CIP1, which in turn inhibits G1 cyclin-Cdk complexes and is mainly responsible for the resulting G1/S arrest (17el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7903) Google Scholar, 18Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). Both p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 are also required for sustained arrest in the G2 phase following γ-irradiation (19Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which p53 accomplishes this task are thought to be multiple and include its ability to transcriptionally suppress cdc2 and cyclin B1 (20Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.L. Schonthal A.H. Katula K.S. Stark G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which are required for entry into mitosis (21Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar). A second mechanism is through the induction of 14-3-3σ expression (22Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 23Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), which sequesters cyclin B1-Cdc2 complex in the cytoplasm (24Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Third, p21WAF1/CIP1 inhibits cyclin B1-Cdc2 and prevents entry into mitosis (25Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar, 26Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Last, 14-3-3σ and p21WAF1/CIP1 have also been shown to exert a cooperative effect in controlling the G2/M checkpoint (27Chan T.A. Hwang P.M. Hermeking H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1584-1588PubMed Google Scholar). Although the induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression has been shown to be a consequence of direct binding of p53 to its promoter, evidence implicates many other transcription factors in regulating p21WAF1/CIP1 transcription (28Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Among these is Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4; also known as gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor or GKLF), a member of the mammalian KLF family of transcription regulators (29Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 30Bieker J.J. J. Biol.

Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). KLF4 was initially identified as an epithelially enriched gene with preferential expression in the terminally differentiated, postmitotic epithelial cells of the intestine and epidermis (32Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 33Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, expression of KLF4 is associated with conditions that lead to growth arrest such as serum deprivation or contact inhibition (32Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, constitutive expression of KLF4 inhibits DNA synthesis and reduced cell proliferation (32Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 34Geiman D.E. Ton-That H. Johnson J.M. Yang V.W.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3424-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This is in part due to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary as a result of the ability of KLF4 to transcriptionally activate expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 (36Chen X. Johns D.C. Geiman D.E. Marban E. Dang D.T. Hamlin G. Sun R. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30423-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 37Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T.

Yang V.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In support of a checkpoint function for KLF4, we recently showed that its expression is activated in a p53-dependent fashion upon DNA damage by agents such as methyl methane sulfonate and γ-irradiation (37Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2101-2105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This induction is correlated with an increase in the levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 with consequent G1/S cell cycle arrest in cells with wild type p53 (39Yoon H.S. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2101-2105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Importantly, inhibition of KLF4 expression in such cells after γ-irradiation results in abrogation of the G1 arrest in a manner similar to the cell cycle profile seen in irradiated cells that are null for p53 (39Yoon H.S. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2101-2105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Conversely, conditional expression of KLF4 in irradiated cells null for p53 restored G1 arrest as if the they were wild type for p53 (39Yoon H.S. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2101-2105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that KLF4 is a necessary and sufficient mediator of p53 for the G1/S cell cycle arrest resulting from DNA damage and does so by activating p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. Since p21WAF1/CIP1 has also been shown to be required for sustained G2 arrest following γ-irradiation (19Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar), we sought to determine in the present study whether KLF4 may also be involved in controlling the G2/M checkpoint after DNA damage. Cell Lines—The colon cancer cell lines wild type and null for p53, HCT116 p53+/+, and HCT116 p53-/-, respectively, were generous gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University) (19Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. EcR116 p53-/- cells were established by stably transfecting pVgRXR (36Chen X. Johns D.C. Geiman D.E. Marban E. Dang D.T. Hamlin G. Sun R. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30423-30428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), which contains VgEcR and RXR that form a receptor for the insect hormone, ecdysone, into the parental HCT116 cell line and selected with 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). The level of RXR expression was determined by Western blot analysis. γ-Irradiation—γ-Irradiation of cultured cells was performed using a 137Cs γ-irradiator at 0.8 Gy/min for 15 min, for a total of 12 Gy. Cells were harvested at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after γ-irradiation for subsequent assays. Medium was changed at the time of collection for the remaining plates. FACS Analysis—Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously described (39Yoon H.S. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2101-2105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Mediatech, Inc.), treated with trypsin, and resuspended in McCoy's medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed with DPBS, collected again by centrifugation, resuspended in 70% ethanol, and fixed at -20 °C overnight. Cells were pelleted once again by centrifugation and resuspended in a solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 50 μg/ml RNase A, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm EDTA at room temperature for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Measurement of Mitotic Indices—At each time point, cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 15 min. Cold 100% methanol was then added, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were then rinsed three times with DPBS. A Hoechst 33258 solution (10 μg/ml) was added to each dish to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml, which was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After the incubation, cells were rinsed five times with DPBS, and nuclei were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon). A minimum of 400 cells were examined per experiment. Mitotic figures were scored for cells with condensed chromosomes. Mitotic trapping experiments were performed by adding nocodazole to the culture media to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Media containing nocodazole were replaced every 24 h. Mitotic figures were examined following nuclear staining. Adenovirus Infection—The recombinant adenoviruses containing GFP and KLF4 (AdEGI-KLF4) or GFP alone (AdEGI) were described previously (36Chen X. Johns D.C. Geiman D.E. Marban E. Dang D.T. Hamlin G.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EcR116 p53-/- cells were grown to 40% confluence in 10-cm dishes and replenished with fresh media containing 2% FBS followed by the addition of 108 plaque-forming units of recombinant virus per dish. Infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, at which time cells were γ-irradiated, and the media were changed. Cells were treated with 5 μm ponasterone A (Invitrogen) for 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h and then collected for further analysis. Medium was changed at the time of collection for the remaining plates. Preparation of Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) and Transfection— The KLF4-specific siRNA was described previously (39Yoon H.S. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2101-2105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A nonspecific, double-stranded siRNA with identical length was also generated based on the sequence of an unrelated protein and used as a control. HCT116 p53+/+ cells were grown to 40% confluence in 10-cm dishes, γ-irradiated for a total of 12 Gy, and transfected with annealed siRNA using DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) for 6 h as recommended by the manufacturer. McCoy's media containing 20% FBS and 2% penicillin/streptomycin were added to each dish to a final concentration of 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were harvested at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h for further assays. Medium was changed at the time of collection for the remaining plates. Western Blot Analysis—Cell protein extraction and Western blot analyses were performed using standard procedures. Protein samples were mixed with loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel in electrophoresis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. Protein was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the Trans-Blot semidry system (Bio-Rad). The membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies against KLF4 (32Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, Cdc2, cyclin B1, or β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Following incubation with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG; 1:10,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), proteins were visualized with the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Cdc2 Kinase Assay—Cdc2 kinase activities were determined as previously described (20Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.L. Schonthal A.H. Katula K.S. Stark G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared by lysing pelleted cells in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Lysates were incubated with a Cdc2 monoclonal antibody. Immune complexes were isolated with protein G-conjugated affinity gel (Sigma). The gel pellets were collected with centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μg of histone H1 (Hoffman LaRoch), 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 20 μl. Phosphorylated histone H1 was resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and visualized with autoradiography. Transfection Assay—Co-transfection experiments were performed with the -287 cyclin B1 promoter-luciferase reporter, pGL-cyclin B1 (-287) (42Katula K.S. Wright K.L. Paul H. Surman D.R. Nuckolls F.J. Smith J.W. Ting J.P. Yates J. Cogswell J.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 811-820PubMed Google Scholar), the expression construct containing KLF4, PMT3-KLF4 (37Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18391-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and an internal control Renilla luciferase. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce a 3-nt mutation into the putative KLF4-binding site in the cyclin B1 promoter (nt -137 to -142; 5′-GGGGCG-3′ to 5′-GGTTAG-3′) using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Two mutagenic primers containing the desired mutation were synthesized (5′-GCCTCACTGTGGCCCCTTACCTCTCGAACGCCT-3′ and 5′-AGGCGTTCGAGAGGGGATTGGCCACAGTGAGGC-3′) and annealed to pGL-cyclin B1 (-287). Mutagenesis was performed using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The mutated sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Luciferase activities were determined 1 day following transfection using the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega). All firefly luciferase activities were standardized to the Renilla luciferase internal control. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed based on a published protocol (43Chun A.C. Jin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37439-37450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HCT116 p53+/+ cells were irradiated or not for the amount of 12 Gy and maintained in culture for an additional 48 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, followed by the addition of 1% formaldehyde in PBS, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, the cross-linking was terminated by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and lysed with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were then sonicated to yield chromatin fragments of ∼600 bp, as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100), and the diluted extracts were precleared by incubation with 45 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and sheared salmon sperm DNA. After centrifugation for 5 min at 7,000 × g, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Immunoprecipitation was performed by rocking overnight at 4 °C the precleared cell lysates with the appropriate antibodies. Immune complexes were then precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads and sheared salmon sperm DNA. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice sequentially with radioimmune precipitation assay wash buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA), wash buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA), wash buffer III (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA), and wash buffer IV (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 1 mm EDTA). The immunoprecipitates were eluted by adding 200 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) to the washed beads followed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. After centrifugation for 5 min at 7,000 x g, DNA was extracted from the supernatant using a Qiagen PCR purification kit. A 3-μl DNA sample was then subjected to amplification using primers encompassing nt -287 and +23 of the cyclin B1 promoter (5′-TCTTGCCCGGCTAACCTTTCCAGG-3′ and 5′-TTCCGCCGCAGCACGCCGAGAAGA-3′). Trichostatin A (TSA) Treatment—HCT116 p53+/+ cells were irradiated or not at day 0 and fed with media containing 2 μm TSA or vehicle alone for 2 days. Cell extracts were then harvested for Western blot analysis of cyclin B1 and β-actin content. p53 Is Required for Preventing Mitotic Entry in HCT116 Cells following γ-Irradiation—The tumor suppressor p53 exerts critical checkpoint functions. To demonstrate a dependence of sustained G2 arrest on p53 following DNA damage, we irradiated HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53-/- with a 12-Gy γ-ray and examined daily the cell cycle profiles up to 4 days following irradiation. Consistent with previous findings (19Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Cells with deleted p53 alleles (p53-/-) were arrested mostly in G2 for the same duration. However, although a substantial number of cells were arrested in G2 for both genotypes, morphological examination shows a steady increase in the number of HCT116 p53-/- cells that entered mitosis beginning at day 2 following irradiation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, irradiated HCT116 p53+/+ cells had a persistent decrease in the percentage of cells in mitosis from days 1 to 4 when compared with that before irradiation (Fig. 1B). Control unirradiated cells displayed a steady and equal level of mitotic indices for both genotypes (Fig. 1A). Both HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/- cells had an intact mitotic apparatus as evidenced by their ability to be become trapped in mitosis temporarily by the microtubule-disrupting agent, nocodazole (19Bunz F.

However, only HCT116 p53-/- cells were able to enter mitosis following γ-irradiation in the presence of nocodazole (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that p53 is required for sustaining G2 arrest and preventing mitotic entry in HCT116 cells following DNA damage. Levels of G2/M Markers in HCT116 p53+/+ Cells Are Decreased after γ-Irradiation—To determine the mechanism by which p53 sustains G2 arrest and prevents mitosis in irradiated HCT116 cells, we performed Western blot analysis on several markers of the G2/M checkpoint. In particular, Cdc2 and cyclin B1 were selected, since they have been shown to be required for entry into mitosis. As seen in Fig. 2, there was a persistent increase in the levels of p53 in irradiated HCT116 p53+/+ cells from day 1 to 4 following irradiation when compared with unirradiated cells. The levels of KLF4 and p21WAF1/CIP1 were concomitantly increased in irradiated cells. In contrast, there was a significant and sustained decrease in the levels of cyclin B1 in irradiated cells. The levels of Cdc2 were also decreased following γ-irradiation but to a lesser extent than that of cyclin B1. These results suggest that the reduced levels of Cdc2 and cyclin B1 contributed to the sustained G2 arrest observed in irradiated HCT116 p53+/+ cells. Inhibition of KLF4 Expression in HCT116 p53+/+ Cells Results in Abrogation of G2/M Arrest following γ-Irradiation— Previous studies show that p21WAF1/CIP1, the expression of which is p53-dependent, is required for the sustained G2 arrest following γ-irradiation (19Bunz F.

In C. elegans, a mutation of the conserved transmembrane Gly123 in APH-1 (mutant or28) leads to a notch/glp-1 loss-of-function phenotype. In this study, we show that the corresponding mutation in mammalian APH-1aL (G122D) disrupts the physical interaction of APH-1aL with hypoglycosylated immature nicastrin and the presenilin holoprotein as well as with mature nicastrin, presenilin, and PEN-2. The G122D mutation also reduced γ-secretase activity in intramembrane proteolysis of membrane-tethered Notch. Moreover, we found that the conserved transmembrane Gly122, Gly126, and Gly130 in the fourth transmembrane region of mammalian APH-1aL are part of the membrane helix-helix interaction GXXXG motif and are essential for the stable association of APH-1aL with presenilin, nicastrin, and PEN-2.

It is now generally believed that the enzyme responsible for the intramembrane proteolysis of these substrates is the high molecular mass, multiprotein γ-secretase complex, which consists of a heterodimer of the presenilin amino- and carboxyl-terminal endoproteolytic fragments (NTF 1The abbreviations used are: NTFamino-terminal fragmentCTFcarboxyl-terminal fragmentTMRtransmembrane regionHAhemagglutininCHAPSO3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acidNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidWTwild-type. and CTF, respectively) as the putative catalytic subunit (2De Strooper B.

It has been reported that mutation of Gly123 to aspartic acid within the fourth putative transmembrane region (TMR) of C. elegans APH-1 (mutant or28) inhibits notch/glp-1 signal transduction and leads to the “anterior-pharynx-defective” phenotype associated with the loss of aph-1, aph-2 (nicastrin), or sel-12 plus hop-1(presenilins) (5Goutte C.

This glycine residue in C. elegans APH-1 has been conserved during evolution and corresponds to Gly122 in mammalian APH-1aL and APH-1aS and Gly121 in mammalian APH-1b. APH-1aL and APH-1aS are alternative spliced forms of APH-1a that differ at the carboxyl termini (7Lee S.-F. Shah S. Li H. Yu C. Han W. Yu G. J. Biol.

Because it is known that the role of the APH-1 proteins in Notch signaling is conserved during evolution and is associated with γ-secretase function, we set out to investigate the biochemical function of the conserved glycine residue in the assembly and activity of the γ-secretase complex. In this study, we used human APH-1aL as an example to demonstrate that the equivalent mutation in human APH-1aL (G122D) affects the ability of APH-1 to associate with the immature as well as the mature γ-secretase complex and inhibits the intramembrane proteolysis of Notch. Moreover, we found that Gly122, Gly126, and Gly130 in APH-1aL belong to a conserved GXXXGXXXG motif (where X represents any amino acid) generally accepted as a major determinant in transmembrane helix-helix protein interactions (17Lemmon M.A. Treutlein H.R.

The in vitro activity assay involved lysis of membrane proteins with 1% CHAPSO, 50 mm PIPES (pH 7), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged proteins with immobilized anti-Myc antibody 9E10.

This N100 substrate, which was overexpressed and purified from Sf9 cells, harbors Val1711–Glu1809 of the mouse Notch-1 receptor and a carboxyl-terminal FLAG/His tag. The γ-secretase-cleaved N100-FLAG/His fragment was detected with anti-FLAG antibody. Miscellaneous—All experiments are repeated at least four times, and representative data are presented. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies, and processed using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Digitonin-solubilized membranes were fractionated using a 10–30% linear glycerol velocity gradient as described (25Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D.

Immunofluorescence was analyzed using anti-Myc antibody A14 and Alexa Fluor® 568-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) on a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning spectral confocal microscope. Gly122 in APH-1aL Is Critical for γ-Secretase Assembly—To understand the effect of the G122D mutation on the γ-secretase complex, we analyzed the ability of human APH-1aL (either wild-type (WT) or G122D mutant) to interact with the predominant in vivo active presenilin species, the endogenous presenilin endoproteolytic fragments. To assist in this objective, we generated HEK293 cells stably expressing APH-1aLWT-Myc/His or APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His and examined cell lines that expressed a comparable level of either wild-type or mutant Myc/His-tagged proteins. No obvious difference was observed in the level of endogenous presenilin-1 NTF between the APH-1aLWT-Myc/His and APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4). In Ni-NTA-agarose pull-down experiments, we observed that endogenous presenilin-1 NTF was able to coprecipitate with APH-1aLWT-Myc/His, an observation consistent with a previous report (7Lee S.-F. Shah S. Li H. Yu C. Han W. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45013-45019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the amount of presenilin-1 NTF that coprecipitated with APH-1aLWT-Myc/His was much higher than the amount that co-isolated with APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–8). Using a co-immunoprecipitation approach, we similarly observed that a minute amount of presenilin-1 NTF or presenilin-2 NTF coprecipitated with APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His compared with the ample amount of presenilin-1 and -2 fragments that coprecipitated with APH-1aLWT-Myc/His (Fig. 1B). Based on these observations, we concluded that the G122D mutation abrogates the association of APH-1aL with the mature presenilin species. Next, we tested whether Gly122 in human APH-1aL is required for interaction with the immature presenilin holoprotein. Given that the endogenous presenilin holoprotein is usually maintained at a low or undetectable steady-state level, we transiently overexpressed full-length presenilin-1 in cell lines stably expressing APH-1aLWT-Myc/His and APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His and performed Ni-NTA-agarose pull-down experiments. We found that significantly less full-length presenilin-1, as well as presenilin-1 endoproteolytic fragments, coprecipitated with APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His compared with APH-1aLWT-Myc/His (Fig. 2, lanes 1–8). These findings suggest that the G122D mutation disrupts the ability of APH-1aL to interact with both the mature presenilin endoproteolytic fragments and the immature presenilin holoprotein.Fig. 2Mutation G122D disrupts the interaction of APH-1aL with the presenilin holoprotein and nicastrin. Full-length presenilin-1 was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells stably overexpressing LacZ-Myc/His (lanes 1 and 5), APH-1aLWT-Myc/His (lanes 2 and 6), or APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His clone 1 (lanes 3 and 7) or clone 2 (lanes 4 and 8), and the cells were solubilized in 1% digitonin. After having determined that the presenilin-1 holoprotein and Myc/His-tagged proteins were expressed at similar levels in each set of cells, we subjected equal amounts of proteins (lanes 1–4) to Ni-NTA pull-down experiments. The resultant Ni-NTA pull-down products (lanes 5–8) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibody against amino-terminal presenilin-1 to identify the presenilin-1 holoprotein (PS1-holo) and presenilin-1 NTF (PS1-NTF) and with antibodies against nicastrin (NCT) and the Myc epitope as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our next investigation focused on the ability of immature and mature nicastrin to coprecipitate with APH-1aL. According to published reports, hypoglycosylated immature nicastrin is mainly associated with immature full-length presenilin, whereas fully glycosylated mature nicastrin is associated with presenilin NTF/CTF fragments (29Tomita T.

In our study, we observed that APH-1aLWT-Myc/His coprecipitated with more of the immature than the mature species of nicastrin in cells overexpressing APH-1aL and the presenilin-1 holoprotein (Fig. 2, lane 6), an observation consistent with earlier studies (10Hu Y.

Moreover, we found that much less immature and mature nicastrin co-isolated with APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His compared with APH-1aLWT-Myc/His (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). We also observed that cells stably expressing APH-1aLWT-Myc/His contained slightly more immature nicastrin than cells stably expressing APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His (Fig. 2, lanes 1–4), suggesting that the G122D mutation may also affect the reported ability of wild-type APH-1 to stabilize immature nicastrin (10Hu Y. Fortini M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16LaVoie M.J. Fraering P.C. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W.J. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37213-37222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we conclude that Gly122 mediates the association of APH-1aL with both immature and mature nicastrin either directly or indirectly during the assembly process of the γ-secretase complex. To test the effect of the G122D mutation on the interaction between APH-1aL and PEN-2, we transiently expressed HA-tagged PEN-2 in either the APH-1aLWT-Myc/His or APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His cells. Detergent extracts of these cells were then subjected to Ni-NTA pull-down experiments. We observed that the association between APH-1aL and overexpressed HAPEN-2 was not significantly affected by the G122D mutation, even though the interactions between APH-1aL and both presenilin-1 and nicastrin were disrupted (Fig. 3A). To examine whether the G122D mutation affects the association of endogenous PEN-2 with APH-1aL, we next performed the same Ni-NTA pull-down experiments with detergent-solubilized HEK293 cells stably expressing APH-1aLWT-Myc/His or APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His. In contrast to overexpressed HA-PEN-2, endogenous PEN-2 did not strongly coprecipitate with mutant APH-1aL compared with wild-type APH-1aL (Fig. 3B). The reason that the G122D mutation affected binding of APH-1aL to endogenous (but not overexpressed) PEN-2 is unclear. One possibility is that overexpressed PEN-2 exists in a state parallel to immature nicastrin and the presenilin holoprotein, whereas endogenous PEN-2 exists mostly in a “mature” state similar to the presenilin endoproteolytic fragments and mature nicastrin. In this context, “immature” overexpressed PEN-2 and APH-1aL can directly interact with each other in the absence of both presenilin-1 and nicastrin, perhaps via a site or sites other than Gly122 in APH-1aL. Because the active γ-secretase complex is not stable when any one of the four components is missing (2De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), the failure of mature PEN-2 to interact with G122D mutant APH-1aL might be an indirect consequence of the disruption of the association of APH-1 with presenilin and nicastrin (see “Discussion”). Mutation G122D in APH-1aL Inhibits γ-Secretase Activity— Having established that the G122D mutation in APH-1aL disrupted the structural assembly of the γ-secretase complex, we proceeded to investigate whether this structural defect could lead to deleterious effects on γ-secretase activity. We tested the effect of the G122D mutation in APH-1aL on the production of the Notch intracellular domain (a product of γ-secretase activity) in a cell-based Gal4/VP16-dependent luciferase transactivation assay. This assay, which indirectly measures γ-secretase activity, utilizes a γ-secretase substrate consisting of a chimeric membrane-tethered Notch receptor trimmed in the extracellular domain (NΔE) and Gal4 and VP16 domains (GV) inserted at the junction between the transmembrane and intracellular domains of NΔE (7Lee S.-F. Shah S. Li H. Yu C. Han W. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45013-45019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 27Karlstrom H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Naslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells stably expressing robust amounts of APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His, we observed a 50–60% reduction in luciferase reporter activity compared with control cells expressing comparable amounts of APH-1aLWT-Myc/His (Fig. 4A). No analysis could be performed on cells expressing higher levels of APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His because these cells did not grow well (possibly because of toxic effects of the G122D mutation). However, the modest reduction in γ-secretase activity in cells stably expressing APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His obtained in the transactivation assay contrasts with the dramatic effect of the G122D mutation imposed on the structural assembly of the γ-secretase complex and the loss-of-function notch/glp-1 phenotype observed in the C. elegans or28 mutant. A likely explanation for this discrepancy could be that the effect of the G122D mutation on γ-secretase activity is masked by the presence of endogenous APH-1 proteins in the cells. To examine the effect of the G122D mutation on γ-secretase activity in the absence of endogenous APH-1, we immunoprecipitated the γ-secretase complex containing either APH-1aLWT-Myc/His or APH-1aLG122D-Myc/His from the respective CHAPSO-solubilized membranes and measured the ability of the immunoprecipitate to cleave a purified Notch substrate containing the transmembrane S3/γ-secretase-like cleavage site (N100) in an in vitro γ-secretase activity assay. We observed a much more robust N100 cleavage in the immunoprecipitate containing wild-type APH-1aL compared with mutant APH-1aL. The presence of the N100 proteolytic intracellular fragment was also sensitive to two different γ-secretase inhibitors (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these findings show that the G122D mutation in APH-1aL has an inhibitory effect on γ-secretase activity. Our studies suggest that the G122D mutation perturbs the ability of APH-1aL to participate in the initial assembly process of the γ-secretase complex and to associate with and stabilize the active γ-secretase complex to directly modulate the intramembrane proteolysis of Notch. However, we currently cannot rule out the possibility that the G122D mutation affects proper trafficking of APH-1aL within cells and thus the formation of the γ-secretase complex. We attempted to address this issue by assessing the cellular distribution of wild-type and G122D mutant APH-1aL. Immunofluorescence data revealed similar intracellular punctate/vesicular staining patterns for both wild-type and G122D mutant APH-1aL (Fig. 5A), suggesting that G122D mutant APH-1aL does not have a gross trafficking defect that could account for its effect on γ-secretase assembly and activity. We also used linear glycerol density centrifugation to examine the native state of wild-type and G122D mutant APH-1aL and found that the G122D mutation did not significantly alter the native state of APH-1aL (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, G122D mutant APH-1aL, like wild-type APH-1aL, existed in similar high molecular mass glycerol density fractions (Fig. 5B"

Malaria, the deadliest of the human parasitic diseases, is transmitted exclusively by Anopheles mosquito vectors. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to complete a complex developmental program in the mosquito for transmission to occur (2Ghosh A. Edwards M J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Parasitol.

Within minutes after a mosquito ingests an infected blood meal, gametocytes emerge from red blood cells and differentiate into male and female gametes. After fertilization, zygotes differentiate into ookinetes that move within the blood bolus. After crossing the peritrophic matrix and the midgut epithelium, the ookinetes lodge beneath the basal lamina, facing the hemocoel, and differentiate into oocysts. Each oocyst undergoes about 12 rounds of nuclear divisions to produce thousands of sporozoites that, upon oocyst maturation, are released into the hemocoel.Difficulties with the development of an effective malaria vaccine and the emergence of drug-resistant parasites make the search for alternative weapons to fight the disease a critical priority. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that direct parasite development in its mosquito host. The molecular dissection of Plasmodium development in the mosquito may lead to new targets for malaria control. Of the ∼5000 predicted Plasmodium genes (4Hoffman S.L. Subramanian G.M. Collins F.H.

With the long term goal of understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive Plasmodium differentiation, we constructed cDNA libraries enriched for Plasmodium and Anopheles transcripts induced during early parasite development in the mosquito. Numerous novel Plasmodium and mosquito transcripts were isolated from these libraries. This work led to initial insights as to how the mosquito uses induction of cell death genes as a possible defense mechanism and to the identification of a candidate parasite antigen for transmission blocking vaccine.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParasites and Mosquito Infection—See the accompanying report (1Srinivasan P.

Ookinete Culture and Enrichment—Plasmodium berghei ookinetes were cultured in vitro and enriched as described (12Sinden R.E. Winger L. Carter E.H. Hartley R.H. Tirawanchai N. Davies C.S. Moore J. Sluiters J.F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1987; 230: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A typical enrichment yielded 70-80% ookinetes containing 15-20% blood-stage parasites.Subtraction Library Construction—Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). Polyadenylated RNA was isolated using oligo(dT) (Stratagene) cellulose column chromatography. For enriched cDNA library construction, cDNA subtraction was carried out using the Clontech PCR select cDNA subtraction kit (catalog number K1804-1). Secondary PCR products were cloned into pGEMT-easy (Promega) and transformed into high efficiency DH5α Escherichia coli to yield the subtracted libraries. Two subtraction libraries, enriched ookinete and enriched early oocyst, were constructed (see “Results” for details).cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—Individual clone inserts from the subtracted libraries were amplified using T7 and SP6 primers and sequenced on a CEQ 2000 DNA sequencing instrument (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) (1Srinivasan P. Abraham E.G. Ghosh A.K. Valenzuela J. Ribeiro J.M.C. Dimopoulos G. Kafatos F.C. Adams J.H. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Biol.

Sequences with significant similarity on BlastX (BlastX, e ≥ 10-4) were grouped based on the function of the homologous protein. Sequences with no significant BlastX similarity were grouped based on their BlastN (BlastN e ≥ 10-10) similarity.Northern Analysis and Hybridization—Northern analysis of total RNA was done as previously reported (13Edwards M.J. Lemos F.J. Donnelly-Doman M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A mosquito mitochondrial rRNA gene was used as a loading control (13Edwards M.J. Lemos F.J. Donnelly-Doman M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Antibody Production, Immunoblotting, and Immunofluorescence— WARP was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase fused to amino acids 45-303 of WARP) using the pGEX-4T1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) in E. coli strain BL21. The purified protein was used to raise anti-WARP antibody in a rabbit. Inhibition of oocyst formation and immunofluorescence assays were performed using anti-WARP IgG purified with the Immunopure A IgG purification kit (Pierce). Mosquito gut sheets were prepared by dissecting mosquito guts fed on infected or non-infected mice. Guts were opened longitudinally, and the resulting sheets were washed in PBS to remove blood. The sheets were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, blocked for 2 h in PBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with WARP antibody (×1000 dilution). Antibody binding was detected with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma).Full-length ancaspase-7-His6 was expressed using the pET-15b expression vector in E. coli (BL21). The purified protein was used to raise anti-ancaspase-7 antibody in a rabbit. Antibody was affinity-purified with immobilized ancaspase-7 protein using the AminoLink plus immobilization kit (Pierce, product #44894). For immunoblotting, 20 gut sheets (see above) from mosquitoes fed on infected or non-infected mice were suspended in 120 μlof1× Laemmli buffer containing 4 m urea and boiled for 10 min, and 12 μl were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE followed by a electrotransfer to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. A prestained protein ladder (Benchmark, Invitrogen) was used as molecular weight marker. The membrane was incubated with ancaspase-7 antibody (1:20,000), and the bound antibody was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Pierce, 1:30,000 dilution) by exposing the blots to x-ray films.Passive Immunization—To measure inhibition of oocyst formation by passive immunization, a batch of 30-40 female mosquitoes (control) were fed on a P. berghei-infected mouse for 20 min. Next, 1 mg of anti-WARP IgG (or pre-immune IgG as a control) was injected into the tail vein of the same mouse followed 20 min later by feeding of another batch of 30-40 mosquitoes (experimental). Fully engorged mosquitoes were selected, and the number of oocysts that formed in the gut of the surviving mosquitoes was counted 15 days later (14Ghosh A.K. Ribolla P E. Jacobs-Lorena M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 96: 13278-13281Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar).RESULTSSubtraction Libraries—To construct an enriched ookinete library, blood-stage parasite cDNAs were subtracted from a pool of ookinete cDNAs from four different developmental stages (6, 12, 18, and 24 h). The subtraction was expected to significantly reduce common cDNAs (e.g. housekeeping genes) and enrich for ookinete stage-specific cDNAs. Similarly, an enriched early oocyst library was constructed by subtracting midgut cDNAs from mosquitoes fed a non-infected blood meal plus blood-stage parasite cDNAs, from midgut cDNAs from mosquitoes fed a P. berghei-infected blood meal. This library was expected to be enriched for two classes of ESTs, ookinete- and early oocyst-specific ESTs and mosquito ESTs corresponding to genes induced by the parasite. To construct the enriched early oocyst library, guts were dissected at 24, 36, and 52 h after a non-infected or infected blood meal. Ookinete invasion of the midgut and the initial stages of ookinete differentiation into oocysts occurred during this period.To assess efficiency of the enrichment procedure, Southern blots of cDNAs before and after enrichment were hybridized with a mosquito actin probe. A ∼7-fold weaker signal was obtained with the subtracted cDNA compared with non-subtracted cDNA, indicating that the enrichment procedure was effective (see Supplemental Fig. 1). Enrichment was further confirmed by PCR analysis of the enriched cDNAs using circumsporozoite- and thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP)-related protein (CTRP), an ookinete-specific gene (15Dessens J.T. Beetsma A.L. Dimopoulos G. Wengelnik K. Crisanti A. Kafatos F.C. Sinden R.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6221-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A ∼4-fold stronger signal was observed with the enriched cDNA template than with the non-enriched template (see Supplemental Fig. 1).Putative Ookinete ESTs—The 457 sequence reads from the enriched ookinete library could be grouped into 175 unique ESTs (Table I). Most of these (169 or 97%) had an (A+T) content higher than 55% (average 65%) and had homology with Plasmodium sequences in databases. This indicates that sequences with >55% (A+T) content have a high likelihood of being of Plasmodium origin (the library was constructed from in vitro transformed ookinetes, free of any mosquito tissues). Of the six (3%) ESTs with <55% (A+T), two were of mouse and four were of Plasmodium origin. The ESTs were further grouped based on their similarity with sequences in the NR and PlasmoDB databases (Fig. 1A). A high proportion (29%) of the ESTs had no similarity to proteins in the NR data base but had significant similarity to sequences in the Plasmodium genomic databases, indicating that these are novel Plasmodium genes expressed during ookinete development. Moreover, 18% of the ESTs had similarity only to the Plasmodium EST data base, not to any known protein sequences. These are presumed to represent genes expressed in blood stages or mature sporozoites, since all ESTs deposited to date in databases are from blood-stage parasites or from sporozoites. The remaining ESTs belonged to various functional classes, as illustrated in Fig. 1A. A complete tabulation of all genes is provided in Supplemental Table 1A.Table ICharacteristics of the enriched libraries The name of the library heads each of the two right columns. All entries (except for insert size) represent the number of sequences. The percentage of the total is given in parenthesis. Unique sequences were classified into unknown, Plasmodium, mosquito, and mouse according to the results of BlastN searches (e × 10-10 cutoff value) for each of the sequences. Most sequences with >55% (A+T) are likely to be of Plasmodium origin, whereas sequences with <55% (A+T) are likely to be of mosquito origin.OokineteEarly oocystAverage size of inserts380 bp221 bpTotal number of sequences457652Number of unique sequences175 (38%)346 (53%)Unique sequences with >55% (A+T)169 (97%)120 (35%) Unknown06 Plasmodium16988 Mosquito026Unique sequences with <55% (A+T)6 (3%)226 (65%) Unknown029 Plasmodium43 Mosquito0194 Mouse20 Open table in a new tab Putative Early Oocyst ESTs—The 652 sequence reads from the enriched early oocyst library could be grouped into 346 unique ESTs (Table I). Of the 120 presumed Plasmodium ESTs (>55% A+T), 43 correspond to putative Plasmodium proteins with similarity to adhesive proteins, proteases and proteasomes, stress-related proteins, structural proteins, and proteins involved in transcription and translation (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Table 1B). Also, 12 ESTs corresponded to rRNA. An additional 19 ESTs had homology to Plasmodium EST data base (no presumed function) and are assumed to encode genes expressed in blood stages or mature sporozoites. Moreover, 10 showed homology only to Plasmodium genomic DNA but not to ESTs or other protein databases, suggesting that these are novel Plasmodium genes expressed during development in the mosquito. Finally, six sequences did not have any similarity upon BlastN (nucleotide-nucleotide) and BlastX (nucleotide query-protein) data base searches and were classified as unknown. We note that 21% (26/120) of the sequences with >55% (A+T) had homology to the Anopheles data base. Similarly, only 1% (3/226) of the sequences <55% (A+T) had homology to Plasmodium databases (Fig. 1B).Putative Mosquito ESTs—Of the 226 presumed mosquito unique ESTs (<55% A+T), 45 encode putative mosquito proteins with similarity to structural proteins, chitin-binding proteins, apoptosis-related proteins, detoxification and antioxidants, stress-related proteins, serpins, transmembrane proteins, proteins involved in carbohydrate and ornithine metabolism, proteases and proteasomes, and proteins involved in transcription and translation (Fig. 1B, Supplemental Table 1B). An additional 64 had homology to Anopheles gambiae genomic sequences encoding predicted proteins. Moreover, 71 had homology only to A. gambiae genomic sequences for which no open reading frame is predicted, suggesting that these are novel mosquito genes. These results should facilitate the ongoing annotation efforts. Although a number of the parasite ESTs had matches to Plasmodium rRNA genes (Fig. 1, A and B), no EST was identified with homology to mosquito rRNA. Possibly, Plasmodium rRNAs were primed by oligo(dT) relatively efficiently during reverse transcription because of its high (A+T) content.Expression Profiles—Seven randomly selected transcripts from the ookinete library having no significant similarity to the NR or Plasmodium EST databases were selected for expression analysis. As discussed below the presumed function of some of the gene products became known after the experiments were initiated. Fig. 2A shows the results obtained with five of the seven ESTs. The mRNA for Pbs21, an abundant ookinete surface protein, served as a Plasmodium sexual stage loading control (16Vervenne R.A. Dirks R.W. Ramesar J. Waters A.P. Janse C.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As expected, none of the clones hybridized to RNAs obtained from the non-infected guts (Fig. 2A). O934 has similarity to an Arabidopsis thaliana putative non-clathrin coat protein (accession number NM_119610) and to a P. falciparum predicted protein. O934 transcript abundance increased 2 h after a blood meal, relative to Pbs21 (Fig. 2A). Expression of O1222, an EST with similarity to the human microtubule-organizing protein centrin 1 (17Lee V.D. Huang B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11039-11043Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), was similar to O934. Expression of O2189 and O1198 also increased at the 2-h time point, whereas O1238 expression paralleled that of P. berghei ribosomal protein gene (Fig. 2, A and B). The expression profiles of O2091 and O1044 were similar to that of the ribosomal protein gene (data not shown), indicating that these may not have a specific function during ookinete differentiation. Thus, four of the seven ESTs from the ookinete library are up-regulated during ookinete differentiation.Fig. 2Temporal patterns of gene expression of selected sequences. Total RNA (5 μg/lane) from blood-stage (bl) parasites or from midguts dissected at different times (2 h to 6 days (d)) after an infected or non-infected blood meal as indicated was fractionated by electrophoresis on agarose gels and blotted onto nylon membranes. The blots were hybridized with the probes indicated to the left of each panel. An A. gambiae mitochondrial rRNA probe was used for the mosquito loading control. A, expression profile of clones isolated from the ookinete subtraction library. Pbs21, a sexual stage- and ookinete-specific protein, was used as a control. O1238 shows similarity to an uncharacterized Plasmodium yoelii EST 94471827. B, expression profile of putative Plasmodium clones (>55% A+T) from the early oocyst subtraction library. E3108 had no significant matches to the Anopheles or Plasmodium databases, but further experiments indicated that it is of mosquito origin (E. G. Abraham and M. Jacobs-Lorena, unpublished observations). C, expression profile of putative mosquito clones (<55% A+T) from the early oocyst subtraction library. All panels in this figure are from Northern blots prepared with RNA from the same infection (90% infection prevalence, mean 50-70 oocysts/gut). Similar results were obtained with RNAs from three separate infections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The analysis of five putative Plasmodium genes (>55% A+T) from the early oocyst library is shown in Fig. 2B. These ESTs were selected based on their similarity to Plasmodium genomic sequences except for E3108, which had no significant similarity with sequences of any data base. Each of the five randomly selected genes has a unique expression pattern. E125 may be expressed only in blood stage parasites. E351 appears to be induced early (2 h), whereas E182, E294, and E3108 are induced at progressively later times after infection. The absence of hybridization to RNA from non-infected guts is in agreement with the initial assignment of these clones as Plasmodium ESTs.Expression profiles of four putative mosquito genes (<55% A+T) from the early oocyst library are shown in Fig. 2C. Consistent with the tentative mosquito assignment, no signal is detected for any of the four sequences with blood stage parasite RNA and all were hybridized with RNA from mosquito guts that had ingested a non-infected blood meal. Interestingly, expression of E151, E2864, and E2998 is induced, whereas E2954 is repressed by the parasite (compare infected with non-infected). E2954 is similar to A. gambiae G12 (accession number Z22925). E2864, which has similarity to 1-Cys peroxiredoxin-like sequences, may function as an antioxidant enzyme to protect cells against oxidant-induced membrane damage (18Manevich Y. Sweitzer T. Pak J.H. Feinstein S.I. Muzykantov V. Fisher A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11599-11604Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).An Anopheles Effector Caspase Gene Is Induced during Ookinete Invasion—Recent work suggested that apoptosis is triggered in midgut cells that are invaded by ookinetes (19Han Y.S. Thompson J. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6030-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 20Zieler H. Dvorak J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11516-11521Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, a group of genes showing similarity to apoptosis-related proteins was identified among early oocyst library sequences (Fig. 1B and Supplemental Table 1B). These included three caspases and one gene containing a death domain. One of the caspases was further characterized. The isolated cDNA has an open reading frame of 289 amino acids, and the putative protein shares 40% identity (60% similarity) with Drosophila DECAY (accession number NP_477462) and 39% identity (54% similarity) with mammalian caspase-7 (accession number NP_203124) (Fig. 3A). As is the case for DECAY and vertebrate effector caspases, the putative Anopheles caspase lacks a long amino-terminal pro-domain and carries a QARCG sequence encompassing the putative catalytic Cys167 residue (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Analysis of the ancaspase-7 gene.A, ClustalW alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of Ancaspase-7 with Drosophila DECAY-1 (NP_477462) and human caspase-7 (NP_203124).

B, Northern blot of total RNA (5 μg/lane) from A. stephensi fed on non-infected or P. berghei-infected blood. The probe was a full-length ancaspase-7 cDNA. bl, RNA from infected mouse blood; 0h, RNA from guts dissected before a blood meal. The time (in days) after a non-infected or infected blood meal at which guts were dissected is also indicated. The Ancaspase-7 mRNA was about 3-fold more abundant in the infected 1d sample than in the non-infected 1d sample. An A. gambiae mitochondrial rRNA probe was used for the loading control. C, immunoblot of A. stephensi gut sheets 30 h after a non-infected or P. berghei-infected blood meal (98% infection prevalence, mean oocyst intensity 404/gut) incubated with Ancaspase-7 antibody, washed, and detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody. A band of 19 kDa is detectable only in infected gut sheets, indicating that Ancaspase-7 activated during parasite invasion. Mobility of molecular mass markers (in kDa) is indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Basal levels of the Ancaspase-7 transcript are detected in mosquito guts before a blood meal with a little or no further accumulation after a non-infected blood meal (Fig. 3B). However, after an infected blood meal, transcript abundance remains unchanged during the first 8 h (data not shown) and increases about 3-fold at 1 day compared with non-infected blood fed guts, suggesting that this gene is transcriptionally activated by the parasite (Fig. 3B). To further analyze the mechanism of gene regulation, an anti-Ancaspase-7 antibody was raised and used for immunoblot experiments. The purified antibody recognized a protein of ∼33 kDa in gut sheets from mosquitoes fed a non-infected or a P. berghei-infected blood meal (Fig. 3C). In addition, a ∼19-kDa band was detected only in gut sheets from P. berghei-infected mosquitoes (Fig. 3C). This apparent proteolytic cleavage product appears to be due to parasite invasion in that the ∼19-kDa band was not detected either in guts from mosquitoes fed a non-infected blood meal (Fig. 3C) or in guts from mosquitoes fed a P. berghei-infected meal, dissected before the start of parasite invasion (15 h) or after invasion was completed (2 days) (data not shown). Moreover, detection of the 19-kDa band required high infection rates (mean oocyst intensity >380 oocysts/gut). These results suggest that Ancaspase-7 activation in the mosquito gut is linked to ookinete invasion of the midgut and occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.The WARP Gene Plays an Essential Role in Early Parasite Development in the Mosquito—Subtraction library clones were analyzed with microarray experiments for P. berghei genes specific for mosquito stages of parasite development. 2Y. Dong, J. X. Xu, A. Kocan, E. G. Abraham, P. Srinivasan, S. Islam, B. Mimana, J. M.-C. Ribeiro, M. Jacobs-Lorena, F. C. Kafatos, and G. Dimopoulos, manuscript in preparation. One clone was further characterized. A full-length cDNA was isolated from a non-subtracted cDNA library prepared from mosquito guts dissected 24, 48, and 52 h after feeding with a P. berghei-infected blood meal. The cDNA was 1679 bp long and had a 303-amino acid-long open reading frame. While this work was in progress, the same gene was independently identified and named WARP (21Yuda M. Yano K. Tsuboi T. Torii M. Chinzei Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The putative protein has an amino-terminal signal sequence and a vWA-like domain (Fig. 4A). This domain is found in Plasmodium proteins expressed in invasive stages, such as ookinete CTRP and sporozoite TRAP. A BlastX search identified CTRP and TRAP as the closest related proteins. However, WARP contains only one vWA domain (as opposed to six in CTRP) and does not have a predicted transmembrane domain (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Structure and expression"
https://openalex.org/W2036211930,"Residues Leu720-Leu764 within the II-III loop of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) α1S subunit represent a critical domain for the orthograde excitation-contraction coupling as well as for retrograde DHPR L-current-enhancing coupling with the ryanodine receptor (RyR1). To better understand the molecular mechanism underlying this bidirectional DHPR-RyR1 signaling interaction, we analyzed the critical domain to the single amino acid level. To this end, constructs based on the highly dissimilar housefly DHPR II-III loop in an otherwise skeletal DHPR as an interaction-inert sequence background were expressed in dysgenic (α1S-null) myotubes for simultaneous recordings of depolarization-induced intracellular Ca2+ transients (orthograde coupling) and whole-cell Ca2+ currents (retrograde coupling). In the minimal skeletal II-III loop sequence (Asp734-Asp748) required for full bidirectional coupling, eight amino acids heterologous between skeletal and cardiac DHPR were exchanged for the corresponding cardiac residues. Four of these skeletal-specific residues (Ala739, Phe741, Pro742, and Asp744) turned out to be essential for orthograde and two of them (Ala739 and Phe741) for retrograde coupling, indicating that orthograde coupling does not necessarily correlate with retrograde signaling. Secondary structure predictions of the critical domain show that an α-helical (cardiac sequence-type) conformation of a cluster of negatively charged residues (Asp744-Glu751 of α1S) corresponds with significantly reduced Ca2+ transients. Conversely, a predicted random coil structure (skeletal sequence-type) seems to be prerequisite for the restoration of skeletal-type excitation-contraction coupling. Thus, not only the primary but also the secondary structure of the critical domain is an essential determinant of the tissue-specific mode of EC coupling.

Therefore, skeletal-type EC coupling is independent from the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (5Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F.M. Horowicz P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Garcia J. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), in contrast to cardiac EC coupling where Ca2+ influx is required to trigger the release of intracellular Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores (8Nabauer M. Callewaert G. Cleemann L. Morad M. Science. 1989; 244: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), which in turn activates contraction. In skeletal muscle EC coupling the voltage-sensing DHPR undergoes voltage-driven conformational changes that are allosterically communicated to RyR1 via the cytoplasmic loop connecting the homologous repeats II and III of the pore-forming DHPR α1S subunit (2Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 9Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The II-III loop is not only important for transmitting this orthograde EC coupling signal to the RyR1, it also receives a retrograde, current-enhancing signal from the RyR1 to the DHPR (10Nakai J.

Beside unequivocally strong indications for an essential role of the II-III loop for this bidirectional coupling mechanism, accumulating evidence suggests an additional influence of other regions of the DHPR α1S subunit and/or of the accessory β subunit (12Ahern C.A.

Nevertheless, one sequence portion of the skeletal DHPR α1S II-III loop (Leu720-Leu764) was previously shown to be essential for bidirectional coupling (11Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J.

These 45 residues inserted into the corresponding regions of α1 subunit chimeras that contain II-III loops incapable of direct skeletal-type (Ca2+-independent) coupling, like the cardiac II-III loop (11Grabner M.

Based on the observation that bidirectional coupling was unaffected by drastic alterations of the sequence surrounding skeletal residues Leu720-Leu764 in the chimeric Musca loop, it was concluded (15Wilkens C.M. Kasielke N. Flucher B.E. Beam K.G. Grabner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that the critical domain Leu720-Leu764 of the skeletal DHPR II-III loop represents a potential site of protein-protein interaction necessary for the functional coupling of DHPR and RyR1, whereas adjacent II-III loop sequences play little or no role. However, the mechanism by which this domain activates the RyR1 upon depolarization or receives the retrograde signal is still poorly understood. In an effort to elucidate the structural bases of this bidirectional DHPR-RyR1 signaling interaction, we fine-mapped the critical DHPR-RyR1 interaction domain down to the single amino acid level in chimeras with the highly dissimilar Musca II-III loop (15Wilkens C.M. Kasielke N. Flucher B.E. Beam K.G. Grabner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as a protein-protein interaction-inert neutral sequence background. Our results indicate a striking structure-function correlation between EC coupling properties of the individual chimeras or point mutants and the predicted secondary structure of the interaction domain. Whenever amino acid exchanges resulted in conversion of a predicted random coil structure (skeletal sequence-type) to an α-helical structure (cardiac sequence-type) of a negatively charged amino acid cluster in the center of this DHPR-RyR1 interaction domain, skeletal-type EC coupling was significantly reduced. On the other hand, a predicted random-coiled structure of the negatively charged cluster seems to be required for direct, skeletal-type coupling. Thus, the secondary structure of the DHPR-RyR1 interaction domain in the DHPR α1 subunit II-III loop may be a decisive factor in the tissue-specific mode of interaction between the DHPR and the RyR1 in skeletal muscle EC coupling. Construction of DHPR Chimeras—The design of the DHPR II-III loop chimeras used in the present study was based on the sequence of chimeras GFP-SkLM and GFP-SkLMS45 (15Wilkens C.M. Kasielke N. Flucher B.E. Beam K.G. Grabner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, GFP-SkLM is composed of rabbit skeletal muscle DHPR α1S sequence (16Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) except for a II-III loop derived from the housefly body wall muscle DHPR α1 subunit (17Grabner M. Bachmann A. Rosenthal F. Striessnig J. Schultz C. Tautz D. Glossmann H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (residues Asp665-Ser790). For GFP-SkLMS45, 45 rabbit α1S residues (Leu720-Leu764) were introduced into the Musca II-III loop of GFP-SkLM, thus substituting for Musca α1 residues Glu724-Thr755. Sequence portions of rabbit skeletal muscle (Sk) (16Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S.

Schwartz A. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) DHPR α1 subunits were introduced into the Musca (M) II-III loop (“L”) of GFP-SkLM. Chimeras were N-terminal fused to a modified GFP as described previously (20Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Chimeras had amino acid compositions in their II-III loops as follows: GFP-SkLMS30, Sk sequence (Leu720-Glu749) replaced a portion of the Musca α1 sequence of GFP-SkLM (residues Glu724-Gly740). For the succeeding chimeras, a different portion of Musca α1 sequence of GFP-SkLM (residues Leu738-Thr755) was exchanged by the following sequences: GFP-SkLMS31, Sk (Asp734-Leu764); GFP-SkLMS15C16, Sk (Asp734-Asp748), C (Glu880-Leu895); GFP-SkLMC31, C (Ser865-Leu895); GFP-SkLMCSC, C (Ser865-Gly874), Sk (Asp744-Asp748), C (Glu880-Leu895); GFP-SkLMK31, K (Asp750-Leu780). Point mutants D734S, A739P, D740E, F741T, P742T, D744E, D745E, and E746D were based on the sequence of GFP-SkLMS15C16 with the following skeletal residues replaced by the corresponding cardiac residues: D734S: Sk (Asp734) by C (Ser865); A739P: Sk (Ala739) by C (Pro870); D740E: Sk (Asp740) by C (Glu871); F741T: Sk (Phe741) by C (Thr872); P742T: Sk (Pro742) by C (Thr873); D744E: Sk (Asp744) by C (Glu875); D745E: Sk (Asp745) by C (Glu876); E746D: Sk (Glu746) by C (Asp877). The cDNAs of the DHPR II-III loop chimeras were cloned into a proprietary mammalian expression vector (20Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and were constructed as follows (nucleotide numbers (nt) are given in parenthesis, and asterisks indicate restriction enzyme (RE) sites introduced by PCR technique using proofreading Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene)). GFP-SkLMS30: The Sk/M transition site (nt Sk2247/M2221) was introduced by using the gene SOEing PCR technique (21Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar) with GFP-SkLMS45 as the upstream and GFP-SkLM as the downstream cDNA template. The PCR-generated AflII*-XhoI fusion fragment (nt Sk2159-Sk2654) was ligated into the corresponding AflII*/XhoI RE sites (nt M2171/Sk2654) of subclone pMux (15Wilkens C.M. Kasielke N. Flucher B.E. Beam K.G. Grabner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For the construction of subclone pMux, three artificial RE sites were PCR-introduced into the Musca II-III loop of GFP-SkLM to be later used for cassette cloning: AflII* (nt M2171), XbaI* (nt M2177/M2258) as a “helper” RE site, and ClaI* (nt M2265). In detail, the MfeI-XbaI* fragment from the Musca DHPR α1 subunit (nt 2024-2177) was coligated with the XbaI*-XhoI fragment of GFP-SkLM (nt M2258-Sk2654) into the MfeI/XhoI-cleaved GFP-SkLM cDNA. The PCR antisense primer was used to introduce together with the XbaI* helper RE site (nt M2177) an upstream AflII* site (nt M2171). Similarly, the sense primer introduced an additional ClaI* RE site (nt M2265) downstream of the XbaI* (nt M2258) helper site. GFP-SkLMS31: SOE-PCR was used to generate the M/Sk transition site (nt M2211/Sk2200) with GFP-SkLM as the upstream and GFP-SkLMS45 as the downstream cDNA template. The MfeI-ClaI* cDNA fusion fragment (nt M2024-Sk2292) was ligated together with the SalI*-MfeI fragment of GFP-SkLMS45 (nt -5-M2024) into the corresponding SalI/ClaI* RE sites (5′ polylinker/M2265) of pMux. GFP-SkLMS15C16: Fusion PCR technique was used to generate the Sk/C transition (nt Sk2244/C2638) with GFP-SkLMS31 and α1C as the respective cDNA templates. Simultaneously, a ClaI* site (nt C2685) was introduced by the antisense primer. Subsequently, the resultant MfeI-ClaI* PCR fragment (nt M2024-C2685) was coligated with the SalI*-MfeI fragment of GFP-SkLMS45 (nt -5-M2024) into the SalI/ClaI*-cleaved (5′ polylinker/M2265) subclone pMux. For each of the subsequent chimeras and point mutants SOE-PCR was used to generate MfeI-ClaI* PCR fragments, which were coligated with the SalI*-MfeI fragment of GFP-SkLMS45 (nt -5-M2024) into subclone pMux according to the ligation protocol as described for GFP-SkLMS31. GFP-SkLMC31: GFP-SkLMS31 and α1C were used as the respective cDNA templates to introduce the M/C transition (nt M2211/C2593) as well as a ClaI* RE site (nt C2685) to generate the corresponding MfeI-ClaI* PCR fragment (nt M2024-C2685). GFP-SkLMCSC: SOE-PCR technique was used to create the C/Sk transition (nt C2622/Sk2230) with GFP-SkLMC31 as the upstream and GFP-SkLMS15C16 as the downstream cDNA template. Hence, the downstream Sk/C transition (nt Sk2244/C2638) is derived from clone GFP-SkLMS15C16. GFP-SkLMK31: GFP-SkLM and carp α1S cDNA were used as the respective cDNA templates to introduce the M/K transition site (nt M2211/K2248) by SOE-PCR technique. Simultaneously, the antisense PCR primer introduced a ClaI* RE site (nt K2339) to generate the MfeI-ClaI* PCR fragment (nt M2024-K2339). Point mutants D734S, A739P, D740E, F741T, P742T, D744E, D745E, E746D: Base exchanges from skeletal to the corresponding cardiac coding triplets within the skeletal sequence portion (nt 2200-2244) of clone GFP-SkLMS15C16 were introduced by SOE-PCR to yield the respective MfeI-ClaI* PCR fusion fragments (nt M2024-C2685). For simplicity, we will refer to the GFP-tagged chimeras in the following text without the GFP attachment whenever appropriate. The integrity of all cDNA sequences generated and modified by PCR was confirmed by sequence analysis (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Cell Culture and Transfection—Myotubes of the homozygous dysgenic (mdg/mdg) mouse cell line GLT were cultured as previously described (22Powell J.A. Petherbridge L. Flucher B.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). At the onset of myoblast fusion (2 days after addition of differentiation medium) GLT cultures were transfected using FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics). 3-5 days after transfection, expressing myotubes were used for biophysical experiments after identification by their GFP fluorescence. Electrophysiological Characterization—The whole-cell patch clamp technique (23Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar) was used to simultaneously record voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ currents and depolarization-induced intracellular Ca2+ transients (24Garcia J. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes (borosilicate glass, Harvard apparatus LTD) had resistances of 1.5-3 MΩ when filled with (mm): 145 Cs-aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.1 Cs-EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP (pH 7.4 with CsOH). Fluorescent signals of intracellular Ca2+ transients were collected microphotometrically (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ) during whole-cell recordings by including 0.2 mm pentapotassium Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the pipette solution. The extracellular bath solution contained (mm): 10 CaCl2, 145 tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). Currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Data acquisition and command potentials were controlled by pClamp software (version 7.0; Axon Instruments). Test pulses were preceded by a 1-s prepulse to -30 mV to inactivate endogenous T-type Ca2+ channels (25Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Currents were determined with 200-ms depolarizing steps from a holding potential of -80 mV to test potentials between -50 and 80 mV in 10-mV increments. Leak currents were digitally subtracted by a P/3 prepulse protocol. Recordings were low-pass Bessel-filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. As shown in Equation 1, peak currents were normalized to total cell capacitance (pA/pF), plotted as a function of test potential, and fitted according toI=Gmax·(V-Vrev)/{1+exp[-(V-V1/2)/k]}(Eq. 1) where Gmax is the maximal L-channel conductance of the cell, Vrev is the extrapolated reversal potential of the Ca2+ current, V1/2 is the potential for half-maximal activation of Gmax, and k is a slope factor. Only currents with a maximal voltage error <10 mV attributable to series resistance were analyzed. Transient changes in fluorescence (ΔF) were normalized by the resting fluorescence (F). For the recordings of immobilization-resistant intramembrane charge movements (gating currents), ionic Ca2+ currents were blocked by the addition of 0.5 mm Cd2+ and 0.1 mm La3+ to the extracellular recording solution, and depolarizing steps of the prepulse protocol were reduced to 50 ms. As recently reported (26Ahern C.A. Sheridan D.C. Cheng W. Mortenson L. Nataraj P. Allen P.D. De Waard M. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 942-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the OFF component of the immobilization-resistant charge is less likely to be contaminated by a nonlinear outward current than the ON component. Thus, charge movements were analyzed from the integrated OFF components (26Ahern C.A. Sheridan D.C. Cheng W. Mortenson L. Nataraj P. Allen P.D. De Waard M. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 942-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of Ca2+ conductance (G), of intracellular Ca2+ release (ΔF/F), and of gating currents (Q) were fitted according to a Boltzmann distribution as shown in Equation 2A=Amax/{1+exp[-(V-V1/2)/k]}(Eq. 2) where A is G, ΔF/F, or Q and Amax is Gmax, (ΔF/F)max, or Qmax. V1/2 is the potential at which A = Amax/2, and k is a slope factor. Recordings were performed at room temperature (∼23 °C), and data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test. Data were analyzed using Clampfit® 8.0 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and SigmaPlot® 6.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) software. Skeletal Muscle DHPR II-III Loop Residues Asp734-Leu764 Are Required for the Bidirectional Signaling Interaction with RyR1—In previous studies, residues Leu720-Leu764 of the rabbit skeletal muscle DHPR α1S II-III loop were demonstrated to be essential for the full restoration of skeletal-type EC coupling (11Grabner M.

A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as for retrograde coupling, which is the RyR1-mediated enhancement of Ca2+ influx through the DHPR (11Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Ahern C.A. Bhattacharya D. Mortenson L. Coronado R. Biophys.

A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To better understand the molecular mechanism underlying the direct skeletal DHPR-RyR1 interaction, we identified the minimum sequence within α1S residues Leu720-Leu764 required for the bidirectional coupling. Because chimera GFP-SkLMS45 (Fig. 1A) had coupling properties comparable with wild-type GFP-α1S (15Wilkens C.M. Kasielke N. Flucher B.E. Beam K.G. Grabner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it was used as the reference for skeletal-type EC coupling and enhancement of Ca2+ currents. On the other hand, chimera GFP-SkLM (Fig. 1B), which contains the entire Musca DHPR II-III loop, was used as the reference for constructs not supporting orthograde or retrograde signaling (15Wilkens C.M. Kasielke N. Flucher B.E. Beam K.G. Grabner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). First, we further restricted the bidirectional signaling domain by generating two daughter chimeras of chimera SkLMS45: SkLMS30 containing the upstream sequence Leu720-Glu749 and SkLMS31 containing the downstream Asp734-Leu764 portion of the S45 insert with a 15-amino acid overlap (Fig. 1B). Simultaneous recordings of depolarization-induced intracellular Ca2+ transients and whole-cell Ca2+ currents from GFP-fluorescing cells revealed that the Ca2+ current densities as well as the amplitude and voltage dependence of Ca2+ transients of SkLMS31 were similar to those of SkLMS45, whereas the values of SkLMS30 were similar to SkLM (p >0.05) (Fig. 1, C and D). As previously described (15Wilkens C.M. Kasielke N. Flucher B.E. Beam K.G. Grabner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the small Ca2+ transients of SkLM and hence those of SkLMS30 appeared to be a direct consequence of Ca2+ influx through the DHPR. In contrast, SkLMS31 fully restored both orthograde and retrograde coupling with RyR1. Fine-mapping of the Skeletal DHPR II-III Loop Sequence Asp734-Leu764 Important for Bidirectional Coupling—To identify individual amino acids of the skeletal muscle DHPR II-III loop essential for bidirectional signaling, sequence portions within the S31 insert of chimera SkLMS31 were exchanged for the corresponding rabbit cardiac (18Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) or for the evolutionary distant carp skeletal (19Grabner M. Friedrich K. Knaus H.-G. Striessnig J. Scheffauer F. Staudinger R. Koch W.J. Schwartz A. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) DHPR sequences (Fig. 2A). The latter diverges from the S31 insert in six amino acids; nonetheless, bidirectional coupling was fully restored by the carp sequence portion Asp750-Leu780 in chimera SkLMK31 (Fig. 2B). Next, we analyzed the similarities and differences between the S31 insert and the corresponding cardiac sequence Ser865-Leu895. As depicted in Fig. 2A, the two α1 subunits differ in 13 of the 31 residues, 5 of which are conservative Asp/Glu and Glu/Asp exchanges. In both sequences Asp and Glu residues form a central cluster of 7 negative charges. Among the total of 13 amino acid exchanges, 10 are positioned in the N-terminal half, and only 3 are located in the C-terminal half. Neither skeletal-type EC coupling nor Ca2+ current enhancement was restored when the entire 31-residue sequence was cardiac. Chimera SkLMC31 yielded small Ca2+ currents and marginal Ca2+ transients similar to SkLM (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, when only the C-terminal half of the 31-amino acid insert Glu880-Leu895 was cardiac sequence (chimera SkLMS15C16) full bidirectional coupling was restored. Thus, the N-terminal half (Asp734-Asp748) of the S31 insert was sufficient to restore both orthograde and retrograde signaling with RyR1, regardless of whether cardiac or skeletal sequence was positioned downstream. This was not surprising because this downstream sequence is highly conserved between the two isoforms. By contrast, if the highly heterologous Musca sequence were located downstream of the S15 portion, bidirectional coupling was abolished (chimera SkLMS30) (Fig. 2B). To investigate whether the S15 insert (Asp734-Asp748) of chimera SkLMS15C16 could be further reduced without impairing bidirectional coupling, two additional chimeras were examined. In chimera SkLMCSC, the cluster of negatively charged residues was skeletal, embedded in an otherwise cardiac 31-residue cassette. This chimera was unable to restore bidirectional coupling (Fig. 2B) indistinguishable from SkLMC31 (p > 0.05). In the second chimera, SkLCS18 (Fig. 2B), the cluster of negatively charged residues was cardiac instead of skeletal compared with the 31-residue cassette of SkLMS15C16. Despite the fact that only conservative Asp/Glu exchanges occurred within this negatively charged cluster, SkLCS18 lost its ability to restore retrograde or full orthograde coupling as had been previously shown (11Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the reduction of EC coupling and of Ca2+ currents observed for chimeras SkLMC31 and SkLMCSC resulted from reduced membrane expression, we recorded immobilization-resistant charge movements (gating currents) as an accurate measure of expression density of voltage-gated ion channels in the surface membrane. The maximum charge movements (Qmax) obtained from SkLMC31 and SkLMCSC were compared with that of SkLMS15C16, which fully restored bidirectional coupling. Regardless of the ability to restore bidirectional coupling or not, Qmax values of chimeras SkLMS15C16 (5.8 ± 0.6 nC/μF, n = 15), SkLMC31 (6.1 ± 0.8 nC/μF, n = 10), and SkLMCSC (5.6 ± 0.6 nC/μF, n = 15) were statistically indistinguishable (p > 0.7). Qmax values of chimeras SkLM, SkLMS45, and SkLCS18 had been determined in"

Subtractive hybridization cDNA libraries were constructed that are enriched for Plasmodium berghei and Anopheles stephensi genes expressed during oocyst differentiation on the midgut. Sequencing of 1485 random clones led to the identification of 1137 unique expressed sequence tags. Of the 608 expressed sequence tags with data base hits, 320 (53%) had significant matches to the non-redundant protein data base, whereas 288 (47%) with matches only to genomic data bases represent novel Plasmodium and Anopheles genes. Transcription of six novel parasite genes and two previously identified asexual stage genes was up-regulated during oocyst differentiation. In addition, the mRNA for an Anopheles fibrinogen domain gene was induced on day 2 after an infectious blood meal, at the time of ookinete to oocyst differentiation. The subcellular distribution of MAEBL, a sporozoite surface protein, is developmentally regulated from presumed storage organelles in day 15 oocysts to uniform distribution on the surface in day 22 oocysts. This redistribution may reflect a sporozoite maturation program in preparation for salivary gland invasion. Furthermore, apical membrane antigen 1, another parasite surface molecule, is translationally regulated late in sporozoite development, suggesting a role during infection of the vertebrate host. The present results and those of an accompanying report (Abraham, E. G., Islam, S., Srinivasan, P., Ghosh, A. K., Valenzuela, J., Ribeiro, J. M., Kafatos, F. C., Dimopoulos, G., & Jacobs-Lorena, M.

Malaria is the major vector-borne infectious disease. Nearly 40% of the world's population is at risk, and close to 2 million persons (mostly children under the age of five) die every year. Despite considerable efforts to contain the disease, the number of infected persons is raising (2Breman J.G Egan A. Keusch G.T. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: 4-7Google Scholar). The lack of an effective vaccine and the emergence of drug-resistant parasites and insecticideresistant mosquitoes warrant the search for alternate strategies to combat this disease. The parasite undergoes a complex developmental program in the mosquito (3Ghosh A. Edwards M J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 196-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Sinden R.E. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 25-49Google Scholar). After traversing the midgut, the parasite lodges itself between the midgut epithelium and the basal lamina, giving rise to an oocyst. Upon maturation, sporozoites formed inside the oocyst are first released into the hemocoel and then invade the salivary glands. To date only a handful of parasite genes expressed specifically during differentiation in the mosquito have been identified. Oocyst differentiation, a process that leads to sporozoite formation, takes close to 2 weeks. Identifying genes that are required for this process and for the subsequent release of sporozoites could provide novel targets to interfere with parasite development. Thus far only two genes, namely circumsporozoite protein (CS) 1The abbreviations used are: CScircumsporozoite proteinESTexpressed sequence tagFBNfibrinogenAMA1apical membrane antigen 1AsFBN1A. stephensi fibrinogen domain protein 1.1The abbreviations used are: CScircumsporozoite proteinESTexpressed sequence tagFBNfibrinogenAMA1apical membrane antigen 1AsFBN1A. stephensi fibrinogen domain protein 1. and a scavenger receptor-like protein, have been shown to be required for sporozoite formation (5Menard R.

The mosquito responds to the presence of the parasite by mounting an immune response. A variety of immune genes are induced during ookinete penetration of the midgut and again at the time of sporozoite release into the hemocoel (7Dimopoulos G. Richman A. Muller H.M. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11508-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The parasite elicitors of these responses are not known. circumsporozoite protein expressed sequence tag fibrinogen apical membrane antigen 1 A. stephensi fibrinogen domain protein 1. circumsporozoite protein expressed sequence tag fibrinogen apical membrane antigen 1 A. stephensi fibrinogen domain protein 1. The lack of methods to fractionate oocysts from mosquito midgut tissues has hindered the molecular analysis of oocyst development. An additional limitation is that only a small proportion of the RNA extracted from infected mosquito guts originates from the parasite. In an attempt to overcome some of these limitations we used a subtractive hybridization strategy to enrich for Plasmodium berghei and Anopheles stephensi genes that are induced during oocyst development in the midgut. Numerous novel genes both of parasite and of mosquito origin were identified. A mosquito fibrinogen-like gene that is induced by the parasite and two Plasmodium surface proteins, MAEBL and apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), were further characterized. Parasites—P. berghei ANKA strain, clone 2.34, was maintained by passage in Swiss Webster mice. Mice with 15-20% parasitemia and 2-3 exflagellations per field (40× magnification) were used for mosquito infections. Mosquito Infection—A. stephensi mosquitoes were fed on infected mice in a 21 °C incubator. Mosquito infection was assessed by counting oocyst numbers of 10-15 guts dissected on day 15 after an infectious blood meal. For each experiment the average oocyst number per gut was 75 or higher. RNA Preparation and Subtraction Library Construction—Total RNA was isolated with Trizol (Molecular Research Center) and polyadenylated RNA was prepared by chromatography on an oligo(dT) column. Polyadenylated RNA corresponding to 75 μg of total RNA of each sample was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) to remove any remaining genomic DNA. The samples were then reverse-transcribed using the SMART cDNA synthesis primer (modified oligo(dT), Clontech), as described by the manufacturer. Equal amounts of cDNA from each sample was pooled as indicated in Fig. 1, and subtraction was carried out using the Clontech PCR Select cDNA subtraction kit (catalog number K1804-1). The subtraction products were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and transformed into Escherichia coli (DH5α) competent cells. Inserts were PCR amplified using T7 (5′-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and SP6 (5′-GATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′) primers and sequenced with a nested primer, PN1 (5′-TCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT-3′) in an ABI377 sequencer. Clustering and Data Base Analysis—Vector sequences were first removed computationally from all sequences followed by clustering of identical clones by internal BLAST analysis. Each cluster was searched for homology using the non-redundant data base and the Malaria Genetics and Genomics data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the BLASTN and BLASTX algorithm. In addition, sequences were also searched against the Plasmodium data base at www.Plasmodb.org, The Institute of Genomic Research (www.tigr.org), and Sanger (www.sanger.com). Sequences with significant BLASTX similarity (P(N) ≤ 10-5) were grouped based on the predicted function of the homologous protein. Sequences with no significant BLASTX similarity were grouped based on their BLASTN similarity (P(N) ≤ 10-10). Preparation of cDNA Blots—After PCR amplification, subtracted and non-subtracted cDNAs were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and transferred onto positively charged nylon membranes. A mosquito actin probe was generated by PCR with primers actin F (5′-TCAAGATGTGCGACGAAGAGG-3′) and actin R (5′-CGAGAGATGTGGTGTGTTGTTTCTC-3′) and labeling with [P32]dCTP using random hexamers. Reverse Transcription-PCR Expression Analysis—RNA was isolated from midguts dissected at various times after an infectious or a non-infected blood meal and from blood-stage parasites. Total RNA (1 μg) from each sample was reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT) primer and PCR amplified (25 cycles) using the following gene-specific primers: PbRP.F (5′-GACTAACAAGAGCGGCAAGA-3′) and PbRP.R (5′-GTACATAAAATCCCATTCCATAT-3′); CS.F (5′-GTACCATTTTAGTTGTAGCGTC-3′) and CS.R (5′-CATCGGCAAGTAATCTGTTG-3′); AMA1.F (5′-CCTTCAGGTAAATGTCCAGT-3′) and AMA1.R (5′-TTTCCCAATCATCACGCA-3′); M184.F (5′-GCCTAAATGTGTTGCGAAGAGC-3′) and M184.R (5′-CAGAAAGGGTGTATAATGATGG-3′); L1144.F (5′-AAGGATGGTTTTGACTGTTT-3′) and L1144.R (5′-ATTTAATTTCTCCAATGGGT-3′); L1147.F (5′-TAAAAGGCAGCAATAACAG-3′) and L1147.R (5′-CATCAACAGATCCGACAC-3′); L457.F (5′-ATGCCTCTTTTATCTGTCTA-3′) and L457.R (5′-GATTACCAGCCGTATGTTGC-3′); L1085.F (5′-TATCATATTCCGCCTTTGC-3′) and L1085.R (5′-TGTGTGCATATTTACATAATCCT-3′); L1096.F (5′-TGATGAAACAATCCAAACTG-3′) and L1096.R (5′-AATTTATCATGGCCCAACT-3′); L2451.F (5′-TGGAGCAACTTGGTGTAA-3′) and L2451.R 5′-CCAGTATTGGTAGGGAAT-3′); L3593.F 5′-ATTCCGAAGTTTAATACCAA-3′) and L3593.R (5′-TATGACCAGCTTTAGCAC-3′). Primers were designed such that their annealing temperature was 45-55 °C and the product size 100-250 bp. The PCR products were blotted and hybridized with a radioactive probe prepared from DNA amplified with the same primer using the cloned insert as the template. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Guts were dissected on days 15 and 22, and salivary glands were dissected on day 25 after an infectious blood meal. Sporozoites obtained by gentle homogenization of guts or salivary glands were spotted on glass slides and fixed in ice-cold methanol. For double labeling, the fixed sporozoites were then incubated for 2 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation for 1 h with polyclonal antisera against the carboxyl cysteine-rich region of P. berghei MAEBL and a monoclonal antibody against CS (3D11, kindly provided by Dr. Victor Nussenzweig). Monoclonal antibody 28G2dc1 (kindly provided by Dr. Alan Thomas) that recognizes a highly conserved C-terminal region from several Plasmodium species was used to localize AMA1. The following secondary antibodies were used: rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), and rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Immuno-electron Microscopy—P. berghei sporozoites isolated from salivary glands were fixed for 20 min at 4 °C with 1% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Fixed samples were washed, dehydrated, and embedded in LR White resin (Polysciences). Thin sections were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% w/v nonfat dry milk and 0.01% v/v Tween 20 (PBTM). Grids were then incubated with anti-AMA 1 primary antibody (diluted 1:50 in PBTM for 16 h at 4 °C. Control grids were incubated with normal mouse serum in PBTM at the same dilution. After washing grids were incubated for 1 h in 15-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% w/v bovine serum albumin and 0.01% v/v Tween 20 (PBTB), rinsed with PBTB, and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde to stabilize the gold particles. Samples were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined in a Zeiss CEM902 electron microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—Full-length cDNA for A. stephensi fibrinogen domain protein 1 was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using primers M2015F (5′-GTTCGAAATTGGAGACGAGC-3′) and M2015R (5′-CACCATGCTCCAGCAAACG-3′). Sequence analysis was performed at the Expasy Molecular Biology Server (www.Expasy.ch). Sequence alignment was done using ClustalW software. Construction and Characterization of the Subtraction Libraries—To construct libraries enriched for P. berghei and A. stephensi transcripts expressed during mid-oocyst (day 4-8) and late-oocyst (day 10-14) stages of parasite development, gut cDNAs of non-infected mosquitoes and of blood-stage parasites were subtracted from the cDNAs of guts harboring developing oocysts (Fig. 1). This procedure was expected to enrich for parasite transcripts expressed during oocyst differentiation and for mosquito transcripts induced in the gut by the parasite. Any common transcripts (e.g. genes expressed in both infected and non-infected guts or genes expressed in both blood-stage and mosquito-stage parasites) are depleted by the procedure. Subtraction efficiency was assessed by hybridizing a mosquito actin probe to Southern blots of cDNAs obtained before and after the subtraction procedure. The signal was much weaker in the “after subtraction” lanes, indicating effective depletion of common genes by the subtraction protocol (see Supplemental Fig. 1 and data not shown). A total of 1485 clones from both libraries was sequenced and analyzed (Table I). The 804 sequences from the mid-oocyst library could be grouped into 689 unique clusters, of which 623 were singletons (sequences isolated only once). Of the 689 sequences, 367 (53%) had data base hits and were grouped according to their presumed function (Fig. 2A). Similarly, 681 sequences from the late-oocyst library could be grouped into 448 unique clusters, of which 334 were singletons. Of the 448 sequences, 241 (55%) had data base hits and were classified based on their predicted function (Fig. 2B). The high proportion of singletons in both libraries suggests that the subtraction procedure resulted in efficient normalization (removal of redundant sequences). As construction of the library involves digestion of cDNAs with a restriction enzyme, some of the clusters might represent non-overlapping regions of the same geneTable ICharacteristics of the subtraction libraries Singletons refer to ESTs found only once. Clusters with database similarities were based on BLASTN and/or BLASTX searches at NCBI, PlasmoDB, TIGR, and Sanger with a probability cutoff of P (N) ≤ 10-10 (BLASTN) or P (N) ≤ 10-5 (BLASTX).LibraryMid-oocystLate-oocystESTs sequenced and submitted804681Singletons623334Total number of clusters (unique sequences)689 (100%)448 (100%)Clusters with database hits367 (53%)241 (55%)BLASTX matches191 (28%)129 (29%) Open table in a new tab A number of mosquito genes involved in maintenance of the redox state of the cell were identified. These include ESTs with homology to thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin-1, metallothionein, glutathione transferase, and glutathione peroxidase (Fig. 2, A and B, and Supplemental Table I). In addition, several components of the electron transport chain, which is a major source of reactive oxygen species, were also identified (Supplemental Table I). Interestingly, transcripts from putative anti-apoptotic genes such as inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (IAP1) and Bax inhibitor 1 were found in mid- and late-oocyst libraries, respectively (Supplemental Table I). This is in contrast to the ookinete/early oocyst library, which contained ESTs corresponding to apoptosis-promoting rather than anti-apoptotic genes (1Abraham E.G. Islam S. Srinivasan P. Ghosh A.K.

A. stephensi Fibrinogen Domain Protein 1 (AsFBN1) Is Induced by the Parasite—Two overlapping ESTs (accession numbers CB602443 and CB602444) with similarity to fibrinogen domain proteins were isolated from the mid-oocyst library. There is evidence that in mosquitoes and horseshoe crabs, members of this gene family are induced in response to foreign organisms (8Gokudan S. Muta T. Tsuda R. Koori K. Kawahara T. Seki N. Mizunoe Y. Wai S.N. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10086-10091Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 9Dimopoulos G. Christophides G.K. Meister S. Schultz J. White K.P. Barillas-Mury C. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8814-8819Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA was cloned by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The resulting 921-bp sequence predicts a protein of 306 amino acids, including a 19-amino acid secretion signal sequence at the N terminus and a 200-amino acid fibrinogen domain at the C terminus (Fig. 3A). AsFBN1 is related to horseshoe crab tachylectins 5A and 5B (25% identity, 26% similarity), suggesting that it could act as a broad specificity immune molecule by binding carbohydrate molecules on glycoproteins (8Gokudan S. Muta T. Tsuda R. Koori K. Kawahara T. Seki N. Mizunoe Y. Wai S.N. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10086-10091Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). AsFBN1 and the Anopheles gambiae homologue are 72% identical, including six conserved cysteine residues in the secreted portion of the protein and two in the signal peptide (Fig. 3A). Analysis of AsFBN1 gene expression revealed that it is induced at 48 h by a parasite-containing blood meal but not by a non-infected blood meal (Fig. 3, B and C). This suggests that induction is likely to be triggered by the presence of the differentiating oocyst. Temporal Patterns of Plasmodium Gene Expression—Reverse transcription-PCR was used to assess changes in parasite mRNA abundance as a function of time after mosquito infection (Fig 4A). In initial experiments, the assay was run by resolving PCR products on agarose gels followed by ethidium bromide staining. Quantification by this protocol was not reliable because many of the target mRNAs were rare in the samples and required large number of PCR amplification cycles for detection. The radioactive hybridization approach (cf. “Materials and Methods”) proved to be much more sensitive, linear, and reproducible. Fig. 4B shows that under the conditions used the signal is proportional to RNA concentration. To partially compensate for the presence of large numbers of blood-stage parasites in the 24h inf sample, more template was used for this than later time points (Fig. 4A, PbRP). Note that all blood-stage parasites eventually die and are eliminated from the mosquito guts. CS, which is expressed during oocyst development (5Menard R. Sultan A.A. Cortes C. Altszuler R. van Dijk M.R. Janse C.J. Water A.P. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. Nature. 1997; 385: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control (Fig. 4A). To analyze temporal expression patterns, eight ESTs that had hits to the Plasmodium data bases were chosen (Fig. 4A). Of these, six (L1085, L2451, L1147, L1144, M184, L1096) are novel, and two (L457 and L3593) had been isolated previously. All but L1096 and L3593 appear to be induced specifically during the mosquito stages and have an expression profile consistent with the library (mid-oocyst or late-oocyst) from which they were derived (Fig. 4A). L1085, L2451, and L1147 start being expressed at different times but all have peak expression during the terminal stages of oocyst differentiation (day 15). These gene products could function in final stages of oocyst differentiation and/or be stored for use during sporozoite invasion of the mosquito salivary gland or vertebrate liver. L2451 encodes a thioredoxin domain protein. Thioredoxins play a crucial role in defense against free radicals (10Rahlfs S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1024-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Aslund F. Beckwith J. Cell. 1999; 96: 751-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and may be involved in protection against reactive oxygen species generated by the mosquito immune system. L1147 may also be expressed in ookinetes (24 h). M184 and L1144 had peak expression at mid-oocyst stages (day 9) followed by a sharp decrease of transcript abundance, indicating that these gene products may be required for intermediate steps in sporozoite differentiation. L1096 is expressed at all stages of parasite development. The predicted protein has homology to halo-acid dehalogenase family proteins. This family includes L-2-haloacid dehalogenase (12Tsang J.S. Sam L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6003-6009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and epoxide hydrolases (13Argiriadi M.A. Morisseau C. Hammock B.D. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) that function in halo-carbon metabolism and detoxification of epoxide substrates, respectively. This family also includes certain phosphatases. The expression of two ESTs (L457 and L3593) with similarity to previously identified Plasmodium genes were also analyzed (Fig. 4A). L3593 encodes a homologue of Rab6, a protein associated with the Golgi apparatus of blood-stage P. falciparum (14de Castro F.A. Ward G.E. Jambou R. Attal G. Mayau V. Jaureguiberry G. Braun-Breton C. Chakrabarti D. Langsley G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is of interest because there has been no morphological evidence of a functional secretory pathway in the mosquito stages of parasite development. The finding that L3593 is expressed during sporozoite differentiation raises the possibility that the oocyst employs a Golgi-like pathway for protein trafficking. MAEBL (L457) and AMA1, two proteins originally thought to be expressed only in blood stages, were found to be strongly activated at late stages of oocyst differentiation (Fig. 4A). Further studies on these two genes are described below. Differential Localization of MAEBL during Sporozoite Maturation—Two non-overlapping ESTs (accession numbers CB603466 and CB603325) corresponding to the C-terminal region of the erythrocyte-binding protein MAEBL were recovered from the late-oocyst library. MAEBL was initially identified as a blood-stage gene whose protein localizes to the apical organelles of merozoites (15Kappe S.H.I. Curley G.P. Noe A.R. Dalton J.P. Adams J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Kappe S.H.I. Noe A.R. Fraser T.S. Blair P.L. Adams J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1230-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, MAEBL was reported to be expressed also in sporozoites (17Kappe S.H.I. Gardner M.J. Brown S.M. Ross J. Matuschewski K. Ribeiro J.M. Adams J.H. Quackenbush J. Cho J. Carucci D.J. Hoffman S.L. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9895-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Ghai M. Dutta S. Hall T. Freilich D. Ockenhouse C.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 123: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We found that the gene is sharply induced during late stages of oocyst maturation (Fig. 4A). Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that MAEBL subcellular localization changes as the sporozoite matures. In immature sporozoites (day 15) the protein was restricted to the apical end, presumably confined to secretory organelles (Fig. 5). In contrast, CS, which is another major sporozoite surface protein, was uniformly distributed in the same sporozoites. In mature midgut sporozoites (day 22) and in sporozoites that had invaded the salivary glands both MAEBL and CS were uniformly distributed on the sporozoite surface. The deployment of the protein to the sporozoite surface upon maturation is consistent with the observation that MAEBL is essential for salivary gland invasion (19Kariu T. Yuda M. Yano K. Chinzei Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The mechanism that regulates MAEBL translocation from the apical end to the surface is unknown. In blood stage parasites, MAEBL has been shown to transit through the ER-Golgi secretory pathway (20Noe A.R. Fishkind D.J. Adams J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The sporozoites could employ a similar secretory system. Reverse transcription-PCR performed using primers representing both N- and C-terminal regions of the coding sequence indicates that MAEBL is also expressed in liver-stage parasites (results not shown). Thus, MAEBL may be required both for salivary gland and liver invasion, as is the case for CS (21Warburg A. Touray M. Krettli A.U. Miller L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 75: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Clavijo P. Santos M.J. Nussenzweig V. Cell. 1992; 70: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). AMA1 Expression Is Post-transcriptionally Regulated during Oocyst Development—The expression of MAEBL during oocyst development prompted the analysis of other blood-stage parasite surface proteins, including MSP1 and AMA1. MSP1 expression seems to be restricted to blood forms of the parasite (not shown). However, AMA1 is strongly induced during the final stages of oocyst maturation (Fig. 4A). In contrast to CS and MAEBL, AMA1 protein expression could not be detected in sporozoites isolated from either day 15 or day 22 oocysts (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, protein can only be detected after sporozoite invasion of salivary glands (day 25, Fig. 6A). Moreover, immuno-electron microscopy revealed that AMA1 is localized on the surface of salivary gland sporozoites (Fig. 6B). In agreement with the immunofluorescence results (Fig. 6A), no immunogold staining was observed with midgut sporozoites (not shown). Thus, the presence of the transcript (Fig. 4A) but not of the protein (Fig. 6A) in midgut sporozoites indicates that AMA1 is translationally regulated during sporozoite maturation. The presence of the AMA1 protein only on the surface of salivary gland sporozoites (Fig. 6B) suggests that AMA1 might be required for invasion of hepatocytes. In this study we report the identification of candidate genes of both mosquito and parasite origin that are induced during oocyst development on the mosquito midgut. The lack of suitable techniques to purify oocysts from mosquito midgut tissues and the small proportion of parasite RNA in total RNA from infected midguts have seriously hampered the molecular analysis of Plasmodium development in the mosquito. The recent demonstration of sexual stage parasite development in an in vitro system (23Al-Olayan E.M. Beetsma A.L. Butcher G.A Sinden R.E. Hurd H. Science. 2002; 295: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) has yet to be adapted for large scale cultures. The present study has partially overcome these limitations by the construction of stage-specific subtraction libraries. By reverse transcription-PCR we demonstrate that these libraries indeed contain genes induced during oocyst development on the mosquito midgut. Ongoing microarray analysis of clones from the two subtraction libraries promises to provide a more detailed survey of mosquito and parasite genes differentially regulated during oocyst differentiation. A large proportion of the Plasmodium life cycle in the mosquito is dedicated to the differentiation of the oocyst, resulting in the formation of thousands of sporozoites. Parasite genes expressed at specific stages of the differentiation process are likely to participate in these events. For instance, M184 and L1144 may be required for intermediate steps in sporozoite differentiation because they have peak expression at midoocyst stages (day 9, Fig. 4) and L1085, L2451, and L1147 may be required in terminal stages, as indicated by their activation late during oocyst differentiation (day 15, Fig. 4). It is well established that the mosquito responds to the presence of the invading parasite (ookinete) by mounting an innate immune response (7Dimopoulos G. Richman A. Muller H.M. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11508-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Less well known are the responses against the developing oocyst. This study provides the first insights on the response of the mosquito to this stage of the parasite (Supplemental Table 1, A and B). Some of the transcripts identified include genes with homology to anti-oxidants and key antiapoptotic proteins such as inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and Bax inhibitor 1. Annotation of the recently completed A. gambiae genome revealed the presence of a large family of fibrinogen-related proteins (FBN; Refs. 24Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T. Collins F.C. Danielli A. Dimopoulos G. Hetru C. Hoa N.T. Hoffman J.A. Kanzok S.M. Letunic I. et al.Science. 2002; 298: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar and 25Zdobnov E.M. von Mering C. Letunic I. Torrents D. Suyama M. Copley R.R. Christophides G.K. Thomasova D.

Some FBN family genes are induced either immediately after a bacterial challenge or 24 h after a Plasmodium-infected blood meal (9Dimopoulos G. Christophides G.K. Meister S. Schultz J. White K.P. Barillas-Mury C. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8814-8819Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In contrast, As-FBN1 is induced on day 2 after an infectious blood meal, at which time ookinete-to-oocyst transformation is completed. It is likely that this induction is triggered by the developing oocyst. Because fibrinogen can interact with thrombospondin I (26Bonnefoy A. Hantgan R. Legrand C. Frojmovic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5605-5612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the possibility arises that AsFBN1 recognizes thrombospondin I domains of Plasmodium surface proteins, such as circumsporozoite protein and thrombospondin-related adhesive protein. Surprisingly, MAEBL localization was found to be developmentally regulated in sporozoites, from apical localization (presumably in secretory organelles) in immature sporozoites to uniform distribution on the entire surface in mature sporozoites. After invasion of the salivary glands, MAEBL remains on the sporozoite surface, indicating that the protein might be required for vertebrate stage (liver) infection. The mechanism that regulates MAEBL translocation from the apical end to the surface is unknown. AMA1 has been shown in various Plasmodium species to be required for invasion of erythrocytes (27Triglia T. Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and as such is a candidate for a blood-stage vaccine in both rodent and primate models (28Narum D.L. Ogun S.A. Thomas A.W. Holder A.A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2899-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Stowers A.W. Kennedy M.C. Keegan B.P. Saul A. Long C.A. Miller L.H. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6961-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). AMA1, which was thought to be a surface protein specific to the asexual stages of the parasite life cycle, was found to be strongly induced in day 15 oocysts. The mRNA is translationally regulated, since the protein appears on the sporozoite surface only after invasion of the salivary gland. This raises the intriguing possibility that AMA1 is required during invasion of the vertebrate liver. The ESTs generated by this and the accompanying study (1Abraham E.G. Islam S. Srinivasan P.

For instance L1085 has homology to the Plasmodium nucleotide data base but has no predicted open reading frame. Many of the genes identified in this study are novel, and elucidation of their function will provide a stronger foundation for understanding parasite development and Plasmodium interactions with the mosquito.

Here, we exploited a non-desensitizing P2X2/P2X1 chimera that includes the entire P2X1 ectodomain (Werner, P., Seward, E. P., Buell, G. N., and North, R. A. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 15485–15490) to obtain a macroscopic representation of intrinsic receptor kinetics without bias arising from the overlap of channel activation and desensitization. From the stationary currents made amenable to analysis by this chimera, an EC50 for ATP of 3.3 nm was derived, representing a >200- and >7000-fold higher ATP potency than observed for the parental P2X1 and P2X2A receptors, respectively. Also, other agonists activated the P2X2/P2X1 chimera with nanomolar EC50 values ranging from 3.5 to 73 nm in the following rank order: 2-methylthio-ATP, 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP, α,β-methylene-ATP, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Upon washout, the P2X2/P2X1 chimera deactivated slowly with a time constant (ranging from 63 to 2.5 s) that is inversely related to the EC50 value for the corresponding agonist. This suggests that deactivation time courses reflect unbinding rates, which by themselves define agonist potencies. The P2X2/P2X1 chimera and the P2X1 receptor possess virtually identical sensitivity to inhibition by the P2X1 receptor-selective antagonist NF279, a suramin analog. These results suggest that the P2X1 ectodomain confers nanomolar ATP sensitivity, which, within the wild-type P2X1 receptor, is obscured by desensitization such that only a micromolar ATP potency can be deduced from peak current measurements, representing an amalgam of activation and desensitization.

Extracellular ATP is a ubiquitous signaling molecule that exerts fast effects by directly gating cation-conducting channels designated P2X receptors, which exist on a large variety of cells, including many excitable cells and different leukocytes (1North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Seven genes encoding P2X subunits (P2X1–7) are known in mammals. All P2X subunits share a common membrane topology, with two hydrophobic membrane-spanning segments (M1 and M2) separated by a large extracellular loop of ∼300 amino acid residues, which comprise the ATP-binding domain. At least part of the pore of the P2X receptor is lined by M2 (2Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which includes a conserved glycine residue that is likely to constitute the channel gate (3Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but also residues of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail appear to play a role in controlling channel permeability (4Eickhorst A.N. Berson A. Cockayne D. Lester H.A. Khakh B.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic N-terminal tails of the various subunit isoforms are approximately the same length (∼30 amino acid residues), whereas the cytoplasmic C-terminal tails are highly variable in length. Both chemical cross-linking studies and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of wild-type and concatenated P2X1 and P2X3 receptors indicate that P2X receptors feature a trimeric architecture, which is unique among ligand-gated ion channels (5Nicke A.

Further details of the structure of P2X receptors are unknown because neither high resolution electron micrographs nor x-ray or NMR analyses have been published.Various homo- and heteromeric P2X receptors have been characterized in heterologous expression systems. Based on their sensitivity to the ATP analog α,β-MeATP 1The abbreviations used are: α,β-MeATP, α,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-trisphosphate lithium salt; 2-MeSATP, 2-(methylthio)adenosine 5′-triphosphate tetrasodium salt; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) tetralithium salt; BzATP, 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate tetraethylammonium salt (mixed isomers); rP2X, rat P2X. 1The abbreviations used are: α,β-MeATP, α,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-trisphosphate lithium salt; 2-MeSATP, 2-(methylthio)adenosine 5′-triphosphate tetrasodium salt; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) tetralithium salt; BzATP, 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate tetraethylammonium salt (mixed isomers); rP2X, rat P2X. and the rate of current desensitization, homomeric P2X receptors are generally divided into at least two categories: rapidly desensitizing (P2X1 and P2X3) and slowly or non-desensitizing (P2X2A, P2X4, and P2X7) receptors. The term P2X2A distinguishes the nondesensitizing full-length P2X2A subunit from the desensitizing C-terminal splice variant termed P2X2B, which lacks a stretch of 69 amino acids C-terminal to M2 (8Lynch K.J.

The different rates of desensitization have been attributed by mutational analysis to various structural motifs, including N- and C-terminal domains (9Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated recently that nanomolar ATP concentrations drive significant fractions of the rapidly desensitizing P2X1 receptor pool into a long lasting refractory closed state, from which it recovers only slowly with a time constant of ∼12 min (12Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A 50% steady-state P2X1 receptor desensitization was achieved by the sustained exposure of rP2X1 receptor-expressing oocytes to as little as 3 nm ATP. Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that the P2X1 receptor enters the desensitized state both at low and high ATP concentrations exclusively through the open conformation. Such behavior can be adequately described by a minimal three-state model, closed-open-desensitized, according to which P2X1 receptor activation and desensitization follow the same reaction pathway, i.e. without significant closed-to-desensitized transition. Recovery from desensitization occurs without channel opening, i.e. exclusively from desensitized to closed.One conclusion of our previous desensitization study (12Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) is that the nanomolar potency of ATP for receptor desensitization can be attributed to the large ratio between the fast activation rate and the slow recovery rate from desensitization. The affinity for binding of ATP to the resting state of the P2X1 receptor could not be deduced from our experiments, but model calculations based on simulated data allowed us to estimate an upper limit of 100 nm for the ATP affinity of this step. Up to this concentration, the ATP binding affinity seems to have no influence on the EC50 values for receptor activation and desensitization. This suggests that the resting P2X1 receptor state possesses a higher affinity for ATP than revealed by peak current measurements, which provide only an EC50 value determined under non-steady-state conditions that is significantly biased by the rapid rate of P2X1 receptor desensitization.Desensitization can be fully eliminated in the P2X1 receptor by simply replacing the first 47 amino acids of the P2X1 subunit with a complementary portion of the P2X2 subunit corresponding to the cytoplasmic N-terminal tail and almost the entire first transmembrane domain (9Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because these regions comprise only intracellular portions of the subunit and ATP interacts exclusively with the ectodomain (13Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 14Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the ATP binding properties of such a P2X2/P2X1 chimera can be expected to be identical to that of the genuine P2X1 receptor. In this study, we exploited this non-desensitizing P2X2/P2X1 chimera for a more rigorous evaluation of agonist and antagonist potencies under steady-state conditions without the bias of desensitization. We found that elimination of desensitization unmasks nanomolar ATP potency for the P2X1 receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—ATP (disodium salt) was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). α,β-MeATP, 2-MeSATP, ATPγS, and BzATP were from Sigma (München, Germany).

To generate an rP2X2/P2X1 chimera comprising the first 47 N-terminal amino acids of the rP2X2 subunit joined in-frame with Val48–Ser399 of the 399-amino acid rP2X1 subunit (9Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), SnaBI sites were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis, cutting just before the corresponding Val48 codons of the pNKS2-rP2X1 and pNKS2-His6-rP2X2A plasmids, respectively. The N-terminal His6-rP2X2A sequence was excised with HindIII and SnaBI and ligated in-frame between the HindIII site of the vector and the inserted SnaBI cleavage site of pNKS2-rP2X1, yielding pNKS2-rP2X2/P2X1.Capped cRNAs were synthesized from linearized plasmids, and 50-μl aliquots were injected into follicle cell-free Xenopus oocytes (17Schmalzing G. Gloor S. Omay H. Kröner S. Appelhans H. Schwarz W. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) at 0.5 μg/μl (P2X1 cRNA), 2.5 ng/μl (P2X2A cRNA), and 25 ng/μl (rP2X2/P2X1 cRNA). Prior to electrophysiological experiments, the injected oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in sterile oocyte Ringer's solution (90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin.Electrophysiology—Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed 1–3 days after cRNA injection. Microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass, filled with 3 m KCl, and broken at the tips to achieve electrical resistances below 1.0 and 1.5 megaohms for the current and potential electrode, respectively. Currents were recorded with a Turbo TEC-05 amplifier (npi electronic, Tamm, Germany), low pass-filtered at 200 Hz, and sampled at 500 Hz (INT-10 AD/DA converter, npi electronic) using commercially available software (Cell-Works, npi electronic). To avoid activation of endogenous Cl- channels, a nominally Ca2+-free oocyte Ringer's solution (MgCl2 substituted for CaCl2 and therefore designated MgCl2/oocyte Ringer's solution) was used for superfusion of oocytes. Measurements were performed at ambient temperature (20–22 °C). The holding potential was -60 mV. Recordings were made in a small chamber (bath volume of ≈10 μl), which was superfused by gravity flow at a constant rate of ≈200 μl/s to allow for rapid solution exchange. Current signals were elicited by switching automatically via magnetic valves between agonist-free and agonist-containing MgCl2/oocyte Ringer's solutions in an order controlled by the CellWorks software as described in detail previously (12Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Data Analysis—rP2X1 receptor responses were quantified by measuring the peak current amplitude relative to the base-line holding current recorded immediately preceding agonist application. Analysis of the non-desensitizing rP2X2 receptor and the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera was performed using steady-state currents. Concentration-response curve parameters were determined by nonlinear curve fitting of the Hill equation to the data using Origin software (Version 5.0, Microcal Corp., Northampton, MA). The concentration of agonist giving half-maximal activation (EC50) was obtained using Equation 1. IImax=11+(EC50/[ATP])nH(Eq. 1) The concentration-inhibition curves and the resulting IC50 values were derived from nonlinear least-squares fits of the Hill equation to the pooled data points (Equation 2), IImax=11+([NF279]/IC50)nH(Eq. 2) where Imax is the current response in the absence of NF279, I is the current response at the respective NF279 concentration, and nH is the Hill coefficient.Agonist concentration-response curves and EC50 values in the presence of different concentrations of NF279 were obtained using Equation 3.

Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The two portions were joined using Val48, which is a conserved residue in both subunits, as a junction point.At a near-saturating ATP concentration of 10 μm, the rP2X1 receptor-mediated inward current rose fast to its peak and then declined in ∼1 s, leading to a complete loss of the response in the sustained presence of ATP as a result of receptor desensitization (Fig. 1A). The term desensitization as used here refers to a reversible functional inactivation by a conformational transition of the receptor itself rather than to down-regulation by receptor internalization and related cellular processes, which lead to a reduction in the number of receptor molecules in a given plasma membrane (18Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast to the rP2X1 receptor, the rP2X2A receptor generated a stationary current as long as superfusion with ATP was maintained. Removal of ATP from the bath was accompanied by a virtually immediate channel closure (Fig. 1B), the time course of which could not be resolved because it occurred with a time constant below the solution exchange time of our system (t10–90% = 150 ms). On the other hand, the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera showed little or no desensitization and thus exhibited a P2X2A receptor-like phenotype, confirming that the first 47 amino acid residues fully eliminate desensitization in the P2X1 receptor (9Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, in striking contrast to the behavior of the rP2X2A receptor, ATP washout was followed by a rather slow deactivation of the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera, as inferred from the slow monoexponential decay (τ = 63 ± 2 s, n = 15) of the current to the base-line level (Fig. 1C).One feature that characterizes some (although not all) P2X receptor channels is that they conduct inward current more easily than outward current (16Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), a characteristic referred to as inward rectification. To examine whether the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera exhibits rectification, current-voltage (I-V) relationships were determined. The I-V relationships of the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera and the rP2X1 receptor were virtually indistinguishable, but differed markedly from that of the rP2X2A receptor, which showed stronger rectification (Fig. 1D).ATP Activates the rP2X2/P2X1 Chimera with Nanomolar Potency—To examine the possibility that the slow channel closure of the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera is indicative of a high ATP potency conferred by the rP2X1 ectodomain, we established ATP concentration-response curves. In the rP2X1 and rP2X2A receptors, half-maximal inward currents were produced by 0.7 ± 0.1 μm ATP (nH = 1.1 ± 0.1) and 24 ± 2 μm ATP (nH = 1.6 ± 0.1), respectively (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the micromolar EC50 values of ATP for the parental P2X receptors, the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera was half-maximally activated by 3.3 ± 0.1 nm ATP (nH = 1.6 ± 0.1) (Fig. 2, A and B), corresponding to almost 4 orders of magnitude higher potency than for the rP2X2A receptor and still >200-fold higher potency than for the rP2X1 receptor. Strikingly, virtually the same concentration of 3.2 nm ATP was previously found to half-maximally desensitize the wild-type rP2X1 receptor by sustained exposure to low levels of ATP (12Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Comparison of ATP potencies for the rP2X1 and rP2X2A receptors and the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera.

Currents were normalized to those elicited by saturating ATP concentrations of 10 μm (rP2X2/P2X1), 30 μm (rP2X1), and 300 μm (rP2X2A). Although 100 nm ATP was sufficient to maximally activate the chimera, 10 μm was used to exclude that the plateau at nanomolar concentrations represents a local saturation. Continuous lines represent fits of the Hill equation to the data. C, ATP concentration-response curves for the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera expressed in folliculated (•) or denuded (▪) oocytes. Responses were normalized to those evoked by 10 μm ATP in the same group of oocytes. Folliculated oocytes were obtained by reducing the incubation time with collagenase from 4 to 2 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The nanomolar potency of ATP for the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera could be observed only with completely defolliculated oocytes, which are virtually devoid of ecto-ATPase activity (19Failer B.U. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Zimmermann H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1802-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression of the chimera in incompletely defolliculated oocytes resulted in a profound reduction of ATP potency (Fig. 2C) in a manner attributable to rapid ATP breakdown by ecto-ATPases located on residual follicle cells (20Ziganshin A.U. Ziganshina L.E. King B.F. Burnstock G. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Deactivation Rates Define Agonist Potencies for the rP2X2/P2X1 Chimera—The stable ATP analog α,β-MeATP is a high potency agonist for the rapidly desensitizing P2X1 and P2X3 receptors, but a low potency agonist for the P2X2A receptor (EC50 > 300 μm) (21Haines W.R. Migita K. Cox J.A. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32793-32798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Accordingly, α,β-MeATP can be used to distinguish between P2X1- and P2X2-like agonist properties. Consistent with P2X1 receptor-like agonist properties, the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera was efficiently activated at low concentrations of α,β-MeATP (Fig. 3G). Virtually equal currents could be elicited by maximally effective ATP and α,β-MeATP concentrations of 1 μm each (Fig. 3A). Upon α,β-MeATP washout, the current declined also monoexponentially (τ = 2.5 ± 0.3 s, n = 8), but at a 25-fold higher rate than after ATP washout (Fig. 3F), although still slow enough to be resolved unbiased by the rate of solution exchange in our system. Strikingly, a similar 20-fold ratio difference existed also between the EC50 values for α,β-MeATP and ATP, 67 ± 3 nm (nH = 1.7 ± 0.1) and 3.3 ± 0.1 nm (nH = 1.6 ± 0.1), respectively (Figs. 2B and 3G). This led us to hypothesize that deactivation rates are inversely related to EC50 values.Fig. 3Correlation between potencies and deactivation rate constants for various agonists of the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera. A, currents activated by saturating concentrations (1 μm) of α,β-MeATP (black bar) and ATP (gray bar) demonstrating that both agonists elicited virtually the same maximal response. B–F, original current traces recorded in response to ATP, 2-MeSATP, BzATP, ATPγS, and α,β-MeATP, respectively. Agonists were applied for the periods indicated by the horizontal bars.

The inset shows the region near the origin on an expanded scale to allow two overlapping data points to be seen separately.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine this issue further, we determined the deactivation time constants (Fig. 3, B–F) and EC50 values (Fig. 3G) for three additional well known P2X receptor agonists: 2-MeSATP, BzATP, and ATPγS. Upon washout, currents declined monoexponentially to the base-line level in response to all of the agonists (Fig. 3, B–F), yet with markedly different rates. A similar slow deactivation as with ATP was observed after washout of 2-MeSATP (τATP = 63 ± 2s versus τ2-MeSATP = 53 ± 2 s), which activated the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera as potently as ATP (EC50 = 3.5 ± 0.1 and 3.3 nm, respectively) (Fig. 3G). In contrast, washout of the significantly less potent agonists ATPγS and α,β-MeATP (EC50 = 73 ± 4 and 67 ± 3 nm, respectively) was followed by a much faster deactivation (τATPγS = 3.9 ± 0.2 s and τα,β-MeATP = 2.5 ± 0.3 s). BzATP showed intermediate potency (EC50 = 16.6 ± 0.7 nm) and, upon washout, resulted in an intermediate deactivation rate (τBzATP = 23.8 ± 0.5 s). Plotting the EC50 values for the various agonists against the corresponding deactivation rate constants revealed a linear relationship (Fig. 3H), thus lending support to the hypothesis that deactivation rates define agonist potencies for the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera.Antagonist Binding Properties of the rP2X2/P2X1 Chimera— In a further attempt to characterize the ligand binding properties of the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera, we took advantage of NF279, a derivative of the classical P2X antagonist suramin. The P2X receptor selectivity profile of NF279 is different from that of suramin. In particular, NF279 allows one to distinguish between recombinant rP2X1 and rP2X2A receptors, which are blocked at 1 and 10 μm ATP with IC50 values for NF279 of 19 nm and 0.76 μm, respectively (22Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. Damer S. Muller G. Nickel P. Lambrecht G. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2044-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 4B). To examine the inhibitory potency of NF279 for the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera, we co-applied 1–100 nm NF279 and 5 nm ATP (Fig. 4A), a concentration that elicited an approximately half-maximal response in the absence of NF279 (Fig. 2). The extent of NF279-induced inhibition of the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera is apparent from the current amplitudes recorded before and after NF279 washout in the sustained presence of ATP (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows the corresponding concentration-inhibition curves. A fit of the Hill equation to the data yielded an IC50 value of 16.4 ± 0.8 nm (nH = 2.0 ± 0.2) compared with an IC50 value of 19 ± 0.8 nm for the wild-type rP2X1 receptor (22Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. Damer S. Muller G. Nickel P. Lambrecht G. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2044-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The almost identical IC50 values and the virtually overlapping concentration-inhibition curves indicate that NF279 produces a equipotent inhibition of the ATP response for both the rP2X1 receptor and the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera. For half-maximal inhibition of the rP2X2A receptor, an ∼50 times higher NF279 concentration is required.Fig. 4Competitive inhibition of rP2X2/P2X1 chimera-mediated currents by NF279. A, original current traces recorded upon co-application of 5 nm ATP (black bars) and the indicated concentrations of NF279 (gray bars) to oocytes expressing the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera. B, NF279 concentration-inhibition curves for the rP2X1 receptor (IC50 = 19.1 ± 0.8 nm and nH = 1.7 ± 0.1, n = 5–8) (▪), rP2X2A receptor (IC50 = 0.76 ± 0.05 μm and nH = 1.4 ± 0.1, n = 12–17) (•), and rP2X2/P2X1 chimera (IC50 = 16.4 ± 0.8 nm and nH = 2 ± 0.2, n = 5–6) (▴). Continuous lines represent fits of the Hill equation to the data. Note that the fast desensitization of the rP2X1 receptor to ATP and the comparably slow binding of NF279 required a 10-s pre-equilibration of the rP2X1 receptor with NF279 before stimulation with ATP. This period is sufficient to ensure that a binding equilibrium between NF279 and the rP2X1 receptor is reached (22Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. Damer S. Muller G. Nickel P. Lambrecht G. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2044-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, the steady-state inhibition of the non-desensitizing receptors can be directly deduced from the current plateaus attained in the simultaneous presence of ATP and NF279. C, the rightward shift of the ATP concentration-response curves at increasing concentrations of NF279 (0, 30, 100, and 300 nm) combined with the absence of depression of maximal current indicates that NF279 acts as a competitive antagonist with ATP for the rP2X2/P2X1 chimera.

These proteins prevent cellular accumulation of cytotoxic drugs either by acting as an efflux pump, increasing outward transport of drugs, or by translocating the drugs to the external leaflet of the membrane, from which they eventually diffuse (5Sharom F.J.

Recent studies have indicated that virtually all MDR cells exhibit a deviating sphingolipid composition, most typically, increased levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) (10Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L.

Detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane domains (DIGs) are among other lipids such as sphingomyelin and cholesterol highly enriched in GlcCer (13Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 14Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). DIGs share their lipid composition and insolubility in cold non-ionic detergents with caveolae (15Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Caveolae are non-clathrin-coated plasma membrane vesicular invaginations of which caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is the major coat protein. Cav-1 is a 21-kDa integral membrane protein that is necessary for the formation of caveolae (16Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that Cav-1 expression, as well as caveolae themselves are up-regulated in Pgp-overexpressing cells and that a substantial fraction of Pgp was located in Cav-1-containing DIGs (17Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32380-32383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation studies suggested that Pgp and Cav-1 physically interact (18Demeule M. Jodoin J. Gingras D. Béliveau R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the present study we employed a human ovarian MDR tumor cell line, which overexpresses Pgp and GlcCer and turns out to be devoid of Cav-1. In addition we used a human colon MDR tumor cell line, which overexpresses MRP1 and GlcCer and does express Cav-1. We show that both ABC transporters, Pgp and MRP1, are predominantly located in (Lubrol-based) DIGs independently of caveolae. Materials—A2780 and 2780AD cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. E. G. E. de Vries and Dr. H. Timmer-Bosscha (Dept. of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands). The HT29col cell line was obtained from HT29G+ cells by selection with colchicine (11Kok J.W. Veldman R.J. Klappe K. Koning H. Filipeanu C.M. Muller M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Doxorubicin was obtained from the hospital's pharmacist.

Lubrol was obtained from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). All PCR primers were from Invitrogen Life Technologies and the High Fidelity PCR Master kit was from Roche Applied Science. Cell Culture and Experimental Conditions—A2780 and 2780AD cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal calf serum. The medium of the 2780AD cells was supplemented with 1 mg/ml doxorubicin. The cultures were passed twice a week. HT29G+ and HT29col cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal calf serum. The cultures were passed once a week. The medium of the HT29col was supplemented with 50 nm colchine, 48 h after the weekly passage of the cells. All cells were maintained in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. All experiments took place during the exponential growth phase of the cells. Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy Mini Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from RNA (1 μg) using oligo(dT)12-18 primer (0.5 μg), Superscript RT (200 units), 5× First Strand Buffer (4 μl), dithiothreitol (10 mm), and 0.5 mm of each dNTP in a total volume of 20 μl. The RNA sample + oligo(dT)12-18 primer were denatured at 65 °C for 15 min and placed on ice for 5 min, before adding them to the reaction mixture. Reverse transcription was performed for 1 h at 37 °C and the samples were subsequently heated for 5 min at 99 °C to terminate the reverse transcription reaction. PCR was performed with High Fidelity PCR Master, using 2.5 μl of the cDNA obtained and 7.5 pmol of sense and 7.5 pmol of antisense primer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final reaction volume was 25 μl. The tubes were incubated in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT) at 94 °C for 5 min to denature the primers and cDNA. The cycling program was 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s and comprised 20-35 cycles. For each primer set, an increasing number of PCR cycles were performed with otherwise fixed conditions to determine the optimal number of cycles to be used. The number of cycles was 35 for Cav-1 and 25 for β-actin. The following primer sequences were employed: Cav-1: sense, 5′-AGCATGTCTGGGGGCAAATA-3′; and antisense, 5′-CTTGAAATTGGCACCAGGAA-3′ (608-bp amplified product); β-actin: sense, 5′-AACACCCCAGCCATGTAC-3′; and antisense, 5′-ATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′ (254-bp amplified product). In each experiment, β-actin was used as an internal control. Water as well as RNA were used as negative controls, to check for potential contamination. Ten microliters of PCR product was loaded on a 2.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Isolation of DIGs—DIGs were isolated from cells as described (19Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Sargiacomo M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For each isolation, confluent cells from two 75-cm2 flasks were washed once with HBSS, harvested by scraping in 3 ml of ice-cold Tris-NaCl-EDTA buffer (TNE) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 or 0.5% (w/v) Lubrol and vortexed. After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells were homogenized further by passing the lysate at least 10 times through a 21-gauge needle. Of this lysate, 2 ml were transferred to a centrifuge tube and mixed with 2 ml of 80% (w/v) sucrose in TNE. On top of this, 4 ml of 35% (w/v) and 4 ml 5% (w/v) sucrose in TNE were successively loaded, resulting in a discontinuous gradient. All solutions contained the following protease inhibitors: 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 μm each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 swing-out rotor at 36,000 rpm for 18-20 h at 4 °C. Twelve fractions of 1 ml each were collected (from top to bottom), vortexed, and stored at -80 °C. The protein content of all fractions was measured using bovine serum albumin as standard. Immunoprecipitation—The DIG containing fractions were adjusted to 3 ml with ice-cold TNE and centrifuged in a Beckman TLA 100.3 fixed rotor at 49,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resupended in 200 μl of TNE, containing Triton X-100 or Lubrol and protease inhibitors (see “Isolation of DIGs”). After protein determination, 5 μg of the DIGs was immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-Cav-1 antibody, conjugated to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads prepared with dimethyl pimelimidate. Beads were spun down by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, for 1 min, at 4 °C and washed five times with TNE, containing Triton X-100 or Lubrol and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with sample buffer (Tris-HCl (0.25 m) pH 6.8, containing 5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) by boiling for 4 min (the boiling step was omitted with MRP1). Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with HBSS and harvested with a rubber policeman. The total amount of cellular protein was determined, using bovine serum albumin as standard. Subsequently, a known amount of cells was dissolved in sample buffer at the ratio 1:1 (v/v) and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. In the case of MRP1 immunoblotting, the 95 °C step was omitted. Protein from the DIG fractions was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and resuspended in sample buffer. Cells, immunoprecipitated proteins, or trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins (DIGs) were resolved on SDS-PAGE (10%) minigels. Proteins were electrotransferred onto Trans-Blot Transfer Medium membrane. The membranes were rinsed with PBS and incubated (1-2h,20 °C) with 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS. Membranes were rinsed in washing buffer (PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20) and incubated (2 h, 20 °C) with a primary antibody against Pgp (1:300), MRP1 (1:1000), Cav-1 (1:500), TR (1:500), β-actin (1:500), or c-Src (1:500) in washing buffer containing 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Membranes were rinsed in washing buffer and subsequently incubated for 2 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:7500) (ECL) in washing buffer containing 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (2 h, 20 °C). Membranes were incubated in chemiluminescence substrate solution, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and immunoreactive complexes were visualized by exposure of Kodak Biomax film. Microscopy—After treatment with detergent, cells were fixed and permeabilized in methanol (-20 °C) over 5 min. Thereafter, cells were washed four times with PBS, followed by a 30-min incubation with PBS/1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Fixed cells were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with a primary antibody against MRP1 (1:300), Cav-1 (1:150), TR (1:150), or Pgp (1:100) in PBS/1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, followed by two washes with PBS/1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Thereafter, fixed cells were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with the appropriate TRITC-conjugated antibody (1:30) or Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibody (1:1000) in PBS/1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, followed by two washes with PBS/1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After mounting, images from the cells were taken with a confocal scanning laser microscope (True Confocal Scanner SP2; Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with argon-krypton and neon lasers and coupled to a Leica DM RXE microscope. Alexa Fluor 488 images were taken at λex = 488 nm and λem = 505-530 nm, and Alexa Fluor 594 images were taken at λex = 543 nm and λem = 580-620 nm. TRITC images were taken at λex = 543 nm and λem = 570-620 nm, in the case of single staining, and at λem = 580-620 nm, in the case of double staining. Caveolin-1 Expression Is Not Altered in MDR Tumor Cells—It was previously shown that caveolae and Cav-1 expression are up-regulated in Pgp overexpressing HT29 cells (17Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32380-32383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We compared Cav-1 expression of two human MDR tumor cell lines, which had acquired their drug resistance through selection with chemotherapeutic agents, with the drug-sensitive parental cell lines. Ovarian 2780AD tumor cells overexpress Pgp, while colon HT29col tumor cells overexpress MRP1 (11Kok J.W. Veldman R.J. Klappe K. Koning H. Filipeanu C.M. Muller M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Veldman R.J. Klappe K. Hinrichs J. Hummel I. van der Schaaf G. Sietsma H. Kok J.W. Faseb. J. 2002; (10.1096/fj. 01-0863com)Google Scholar). Lysates of HT29G+, HT29col, A2780, and 2780AD cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and analyzed for Cav-1 immunoreactivity (see “Experimental Procedures”). The levels of Cav-1 were similar in drug-resistant HT29col cells and their parental HT29G+ counterpart (Fig. 1A). No clear Cav-1 expression was detectable in 2780 cells, either in the parental A2780 cells or in drug-resistant 2780AD cells (Fig. 1A). The slight staining at the molecular weight of Cav-1 observed especially in the A2780 cells is most likely unspecific, since multiple bands of similar intensity were seen throughout the blot in all four cell lines. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that specific Cav-1 staining was absent in 2780 cells (A and AD) as judged by confocal scanning microscopy after immunostaining with anti-Cav-1 antibody (Fig. 1B). To further confirm that Cav-1 expression did not occur in 2780 ovarian carcinoma cells, we examined Cav-1 expression at the mRNA level by RT-PCR, using specific primers (see “Experimental Procedures”). No expression of Cav-1 was observed in either A2780 or 2780AD cells (Fig. 1C). In conclusion, Cav-1 is not expressed at all in 2780 cells and not up-regulated in drug-resistant HT29 cells. ABC Transporters Are Predominantly Located in Lubrol-based DIGs of MDR Cancer Cells—Pgp overexpressing 2780AD cells did not express Cav-1 and therefore lack caveolae. We next examined whether Pgp is localized in non-caveolar DIGs. Triton X-100-based lysates were prepared from 2780AD cells, followed by fractionation in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient and analysis of the fractions for Pgp immunoreactivity. Pgp was enriched in the detergent-insoluble fractions 4 and 5, but a considerable amount was located in the detergent-soluble fractions 8-12 (Fig. 2A). c-Src, an established marker of Triton X-100-based DIGs (20Yamamura S. Handa K. Hakomori S Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), was indeed predominantly concentrated in the detergent-insoluble fractions 4-6, while the non-DIG markers TR and β-actin were localized in the detergent-soluble fractions 8-12 (Fig. 2A). Compared with Pgp in 2780AD cells, MRP1 in HT29col cells was less enriched in the detergent-insoluble fractions 4 and 5, while most of this transporter was located in the detergent-soluble fractions 8-12 (Fig. 3A). As controls, Cav-1 and c-Src were localized in the detergent-insoluble fractions 4-6, while TR and β-actin were localized in the detergent-soluble fractions 8-12 (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Localization of MRP1 in low density, detergent-insoluble membrane domains. Triton X-100 (A) or Lubrol (B) lysates prepared from HT29col cells were fractionated by flotation in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. Aliquots of each fraction, containing 10 μg of protein, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (see “Experimental Procedures”). Monoclonal antibodies against MRP1, TR, and β-actin and polyclonal antibodies against Cav-1 and c-Src were employed. Shown are typical results from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When a different non-ionic detergent, Lubrol, was used to prepare DIGs from MDR cells, both Pgp and MRP1 were almost completely localized in the detergent-insoluble fractions 3-7, in 2780AD (Fig. 2B) and HT29col (Fig. 3B) cells, respectively. MRP1 co-fractionated with both Cav-1 and c-Src (Fig. 3B), while Pgp also co-fractionated with c-Src (Fig. 2B). As expected, β-actin was localized in the detergent-soluble fractions 8-12, but surprisingly, TR shifted completely to the detergent-insoluble fractions in both cell lines (Figs. 2B and 3B). These observations were confirmed with confocal scanning laser microscopy (Fig. 4). Pgp was only partly resistant to Triton X-100 treatment (Fig. 4, J and K), and plasma membrane localized MRP1 even to a lesser extent (Fig. 4, A and B). However, both Pgp (Fig. 4, J and L) and MRP1 (Fig. 4, A and C) were completely resistant to Lubrol treatment. TR was completely resistant to Lubrol treatment but very strongly reduced after Triton X-100 treatment in both HT29col (Fig. 4, G-I) and 2780AD cells (Fig. 4, M-O), while Cav-1 was completely resistant to both Triton X-100 and Lubrol treatment (Fig. 4, D-F). MRP1 Is Not Localized in Caveolae—MRP1 co-fractionated with Cav-1 in Lubrol-based DIGs, but not in Triton X-100-based DIGs, suggesting that the two proteins do not co-localize in caveolae in intact cells. This was further examined by double immunostaining and confocal scanning microscopy (Fig. 5, A-C). Hardly any colocalization of MRP1 and Cav-1 was observed, as indicated by the virtual absence of yellow staining in the merged image (Fig. 5C). MRP1 was homogeneously distributed over the membrane in contrast to Cav-1, which displayed a dot-like staining pattern, indicative of local accumulation. Also TR and Cav-1 showed hardly any colocalization (Fig. 5, D-F), while TR and MRP1 did colocalize to a large extent (Fig. 5, G-H). Cav-1 and MRP1 Are Localized in Different Regions of Lubrol DIGs—Although MRP1 and Cav-1 did not colocalize, they were both found in the Lubrol-based DIG fractions. We therefore investigated if these two proteins might be localized in different regions of the Lubrol-based DIGs. Triton X-100-based and Lubrol-based lysates were prepared from MRP1 overexpressing HT29col cells and fractionated in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. The detergent-insoluble floating fractions 4-6 were used to immunoprecipitate proteins with anti-Cav-1 antibodies. During the immunoprecipitation procedure the detergent-resistant fractions were treated with solubilization buffer containing either Triton X-100 or Lubrol. The anti-Cav-1 immunoprecipitated complexes that were retained during this procedure were analyzed for MRP1 or TR immunoreactivity. Starting with Triton X-100-based DIGs neither MRP1 nor TR was co-immunoprecipitated with Cav-1 (Fig. 6). This was also the case when Lubrol-based DIGs were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cav-1, using Triton X-100 in the solubilization buffer. However, when Lubrol was used in the solubilization buffer instead of Triton X-100, both MRP1 and TR were co-immunoprecipitated with Cav-1. Fig. 6 also shows that Cav-1 was immunoprecipitated under all conditions. In fact, Cav-1 appears to be somewhat more concentrated in Triton X-100-based DIGs compared with Lubrol-based DIGs, but still does not co-immunoprecipitate MRP1 or TR. In conclusion, our data indicate that Cav-1 is localized in a Triton X-100 insoluble region of the Lubrol DIGs, while MRP1 and TR are localized in a Triton X-100-soluble region of the same Lubrol-based DIGs. It has been shown that caveolae, as well as their main constituent Cav-1, are up-regulated in MDR tumor cells (17Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32380-32383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Moreover, a substantial fraction of Pgp was located in Cav-1-containing DIGs of both sensitive and MDR tumor cells (17Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32380-32383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Demeule M. Jodoin J. Gingras D. Béliveau R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A strong correlation between MDR of tumor cells and their altered sphingolipid metabolism and composition has become apparent in recent years. Most typically, increased levels of GlcCer were observed in many MDR tumor cells (10Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 11Kok J.W. Veldman R.J. Klappe K. Koning H. Filipeanu C.M. Muller M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Veldman R.J. Klappe K. Hinrichs J. Hummel I. van der Schaaf G. Sietsma H. Kok J.W. Faseb. J. 2002; (10.1096/fj. 01-0863com)Google Scholar). This opens the possibility that in MDR tumor cells both Pgp and GlcCer are up-regulated and localized in caveolae, resulting in an increased number of these membrane domains. However, it is difficult to distinguish between caveolar and non-caveolar DIGs as the site of Pgp and GlcCer localization, given the detergent-insolubility and co-fractionation properties they have in common. In this study, we set out to determine whether caveolae are necessary in MDR tumor cells to accommodate their overexpressed ABC transporters. While several MDR cancer cells express high Cav-1 levels and exhibit a high surface density of caveolae (17Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32380-32383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 21Yang C.P. Galbiati F. Volonte D. Horwitz S.B. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the question remains how crucial caveolae are for the development of MDR. We investigated two human MDR cell lines, which have in common that they overexpress a functional ABC transporter and display enhanced GlcCer levels (11Kok J.W. Veldman R.J. Klappe K. Koning H. Filipeanu C.M. Muller M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Veldman R.J. Klappe K. Hinrichs J. Hummel I. van der Schaaf G. Sietsma H. Kok J.W. Faseb. J. 2002; (10.1096/fj. 01-0863com)Google Scholar). Moreover, they differ according to the type of ABC transporter (Pgp or MRP1), allowing us to draw more generalized conclusions as to the localization of members of the ABC transporter family. To investigate if the increased levels of GlcCer could possibly be explained by an increase of caveolae we compared Cav-1 expression between the MDR cell lines and the sensitive counterparts they originated from. The 2780AD model provided a clear answer. 2780AD cells had obtained a high level of Pgp expression and MDR in the complete absence of caveolae. Although Cav-1 was expressed in HT29 cells, it was not up-regulated in drug-resistant HT29col cells. Furthermore, MRP1 and Cav-1 did not appear to colocalize in HT29col cells. Only a minor fraction of the MRP1 was localized in the Cav-1-containing DIG fractions obtained after extraction with Triton X-100 (Fig. 3A). In addition, we used Lubrol as a different non-ionic detergent to obtain DIGs. The so-called Lubrol-based DIGs were first identified in MDCK cells transfected with the pentaspan membrane protein prominin (22Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, transfected with Pgp, it was shown that Lubrol rafts are involved in the apical trafficking of Pgp (23Aït Slimane T. Trugnan G. van Ijzendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Using Lubrol, MRP1 was almost completely localized in Cav-1-containing DIG fractions (Fig. 3B). This does not mean, however, that MRP1 and Cav-1 are necessarily colocalizing. Indeed, using immunoprecipitation, we were able to dissociate MRP1 and Cav-1 in Lubrol-based DIGs. Triton X-100- and Lubrol-based DIGs were isolated and Cav-1 was immunoprecipitated from these DIGs. In contrast to Triton X-100-based DIGs, MRP1 initially coimmunoprecipitated with Cav-1 in Lubrol-based DIGs, when Lubrol was used in the solubilization buffer. However, when Lubrol was replaced by Triton X-100 in the solubilization buffer during the immunoprecipitation procedure, MRP1 no longer co-immunoprecipitated with Cav-1 (Fig. 6). Apparently, Triton X-100 in the solubilization buffer partly solubilized Lubrol-based DIGs, resulting in the dissociation of MRP1 and Cav-1. This shows that at least some Lubrol-based DIGs contain both MRP1 and Cav-1 (as well as TR), but Cav-1 is located in a Triton X-100-insoluble region of these DIGs, while MRP1 (and TR) are located in a Triton X-100-soluble region. This is in agreement with a recent study, showing in human macrophages and fibroblasts that Lubrol-based DIGs contain a considerable part of Triton X-100-based DIGs (24Drobnik W. Borsukova H. Bottcher A. Pfeiffer A. Liebisch G. Schutz G.J. Schindler H. Schmitz G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, confocal scanning laser microscopy showed hardly any co-localization between MRP1 (or TR) and Cav-1 (Fig. 5, A-F), while MRP1 and TR were co-localizing (Fig. 5, G-I). It should be noted that although MRP1 did not localize to caveolae, a possible role of Cav-1 in the process of MDR in HT29col cells could not be excluded. Caveolae could possible play a role in the cholesterol flux to the DIGs. As Cav-1 is thought to be an important factor in the transport of cholesterol to the plasma membrane (25Smart E.J. Ying Y-S Donzell W.C. Anderson G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), caveolae could than act as plasma membrane terminals from where free cholesterol flows to non-caveolar regions of the membrane, e.g. DIGs (26Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2506-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that caveolin-dependent cholesterol efflux pathways may play a role in delivering drugs from various intracellular membranes, into which they partition, to plasma membrane-localized drug efflux pumps (28Liscovitch M. Lavie Y Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 530-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). While the role of caveolae in MDR is still not clear, this study shows that the presence of caveolae is not an absolute requirement for the development of MDR. We have shown that ABC transporters are preferably localized not in caveolae, but rather in non-caveolar Lubrol-based DIGs. The physiological significance of this localization is at present unknown. It has been shown that disturbance of DIG integrity by cholesterol depletion does not necessarily affect the functioning of Pgp, located in these DIGs (29Luker G.D. Pica C.M. Kumar A.S. Covey D.F. Piwnica-Worms D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7651-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cholesterol depletion did disturb the normal apical trafficking of Pgp in HepG2 cells (23Aït Slimane T. Trugnan G. van Ijzendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, we obtained evidence showing that MRP1 and GlcCer are coordinately up-regulated and enriched in rafts during multidrug resistance acquirement in HT29col cells. 2K. Klappe, J. W. J. Hinrichs, B. J. Kroesen, H. Sietsma, and J. W. Kok, unpublished observations. This indicates that DIGs may indeed be important determinants in MDR acquirement and MDR-associated changes in sphingolipid composition."

The cellular death that occurs after ischemic insult has long been associated with necrosis. However, recent reports have established apoptosis as a significant contributor to cell death after I/R. Hypoxia, or decreased oxygen tension (pO2), arises during a variety of pathophysiological states such as ischemia, respiratory diseases, and tumorigenesis. Cell death may occur during the hypoxic phase preceding reoxygenation, in which case early membrane damage leads to the deregulation of degradative systems (necrosis) as well as the activation of cell death programs (apoptosis). Sublethal hypoxia damage may sensitize cells to reoxygenation-induced cell injury. Of particular clinical interest, an additional loss of parenchymal cells occurs during reoxygenation.

Two main apoptotic pathways have been defined in endothelial cells, an extrinsic pathway mediated by death receptor family proteins (i.e. Fas) and an intrinsic pathway mediated by the mitochondria. The initiation of the apoptotic process of cell death by H/R involves several possibilities. The expression of Fas ligand (FasL) during H/R may trigger Fas-dependent death pathways (1Vogt M.

Debatin K.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) involving the recruitment and activation of caspase-8 and subsequent activation of effector caspases. This death cascade may also be amplified by caspase-8-dependent Bid activation, leading to mitochondrial damage and release of apoptogenic factors. H/R may cause irreparable mitochondrial damage because mammalian cells depend on mitochondria for long term viability. In human fetal alveolar type II epithelial cells the antiapoptotic proto-oncogene Bcl-2 displayed maximum abundance in hypoxia and mild reoxygenation (3Haddad J.J. Land S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hypoxia also induced a time-dependent mitochondrial translocation of Bax, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, with the subsequent release of cytochrome c (4Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Bax reciprocally control apoptosis by respectively inhibiting or stimulating mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Cytosolic cytochrome c and Apaf-1 cooperatively activate initiator caspase-9 that triggers a caspase cascade leading to apoptosis (5Cain K. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), originally identified as a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes, exerts potent motogenic, mitogenic, and morphogenic activities on a wide variety of cells by activating the receptor tyrosine kinase cMet. The role of HGF-cMet signaling in the antiapoptotic effects of HGF remains unclear. The binding of HGF to cMet activates specific signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent Akt phosphorylation (6Xiao G.H. Jeffers M. Bellacosa A. Mitsuuchi Y. Vande Woude G.F. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Akt, a crucial antiapoptotic signal transducer with pleiotropic downstream effects, can inhibit apoptosis through phosphorylation and inactivation of the proapoptotic protein, Bad (7Datta S.R.

Furthermore, cMet can inhibit apoptosis by binding to and sequestering the death receptors (i.e. Fas) to prevent receptor oligomerization and clustering (8Wang X. DeFrances M.C. Dai Y.

Hypoxic conditions enhanced HGF expression whereas cMet expression was inhibited in cultured rat islets (10Vasir B. Reitz P. Xu G. Sharma A. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). HGF protected myocardium from ischemia/reperfusion injury (11Nakamura T. Mizuno S. Matsumoto K. Sawa Y. Matsuda H.

HGF significantly increased Bcl-2 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas HGF failed to affect Bcl-XL and Bax in human endothelial cells (12Yamamoto K. Morishita R. Hayashi S. Matsushita H. Nakagami H.

We have examined the intracellular signals triggered by hypoxic stress that result in cell death during reoxygenation. Using murine lung endothelial cells (MLEC) we show for the first time that, in addition to the mitochondrial translocation of Bax, hypoxia induces a time-dependent cleavage of Bid via a death-inducing signal complex (DISC) formation and activation of caspase-8. HGF protects against H/R-induced apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of FLICE-like inhibiting protein (FLIP), an inhibitor of caspase-8, by phosphorylating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and by blocking the mitochondrial translocation of Bax. Chemicals and Reagents—Antibodies anti-Bax, anti-Bid, anti-Bak, anti-caspase-3, -8, and -9, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-XL/S, anti-Fas, and anti-FLIP were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-p38 and anti-phospho-p38 from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA); recombinant human HGF from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN); digitonin from Sigma; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay kit from Roche Diagnostics Corp.; adenovirus-Hu-FLIP and adenovirus-LacZ were supplied by the Center for Biotechnology & Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh (www.vectorcore.pitt.edu). PD98059, wortmannin, and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Isolation and Culture of MLEC—The isolation of endothelial cells by an immunobead protocol has been reported elsewhere (13Tang Z.L. Wasserloos K.J. Liu X. Stitt M.S. Reynolds I.J. Pitt B.R. St. Croix C.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse lungs were digested in collagenase and filtered through 100-μm cell strainers, centrifuged, and washed twice with medium. Cell suspensions were incubated with a monoclonal antibody (rat anti-mouse) against platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with buffer to remove unbound antibody and were resuspended in a binding buffer containing washed magnetic beads coated with sheep anti-rat IgG. Attached cells were washed four to five times in cell culture medium and then were digested with trypsin/EDTA to detach the beads. Bead free cells were centrifuged and resuspended for culture. After two passages the cells were incubated with fluorescent labeled diacetylated low density lipoprotein, which is taken up only by endothelial cells and macrophages and sorted to homogeneity by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Cell Culture and Treatments—The MLEC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 6.32 g/liter Hepes, and 3.3 ml of endothelial cell growth supplements in humidified incubators at 37 °C. For adenoviral infections, the cells were grown to 30% confluence and changed to serum free medium containing 106 plaque-forming units/ml of an adenoviral vector inserted with Hu-FLIP or LacZ. Infected cells were incubated for 3 h and then restored to normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for an additional 2 days of incubation. For hypoxia treatment, the MLEC were grown to 90% confluence, changed to fresh medium, and transferred to a COY anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratory Products, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) with 95% N2, 5% CO2 for 24 h. After hypoxia incubation, the cells were restored to 95% air, 5% CO2 for various reoxygenation intervals. For HGF treatment, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 6.32 g/liter Hepes, and 3.3 ml of endothelial cell growth supplements for 12 h and then treated with HGF (50 ng/ml) for 2 h prior to the initiation of hypoxia/reoxygenation. LDH Release Assay—LDH release was measured using a commercially available assay (Cytotoxicity Detection Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After gentle agitation, 200 μl of culture medium was removed at various times for the assay. The samples were incubated (30 min) with buffer containing NAD+, lactate, and tetrazolium. LDH converts lactate to pyruvate generating NADH. The NADH then reduces tetrazolium (yellow) to formazan (red), which was detected by absorbance (490 nm). Mitochondrial Isolation—At various times following exposure to H/R, MLEC were harvested in 0.05% digitonin in an extraction buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2 with protease inhibitors. The cell extracts were spun at 700 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and then centrifuged again at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The resulting supernatants were removed, and the pellets were retained for Western blotting. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were isolated from the culture of MLEC with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). For immunoprecipitation, 1 μg of anti-Fas antibody was added to 500 μg of total protein in 500 μl, rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, and then incubated with 20 μl of beads (protein A-sucrose, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for another 2 h, spun down at 500 × g, and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Then, 20 μl of loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) was added. For SDS-PAGE, samples containing equal amounts of protein were boiled in the loading buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and stained with the primary antibodies for 2 h at the optimal concentrations. After five washes in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20, the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied, and the blot was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. H/R Induces Cell Death and Activation of Caspases—To investigate the effect of H/R on pulmonary cell death, we used LDH release as a measure of cell death. MLEC were exposed to hypoxia (95% N2, 5% CO2) for 24 h and then reoxygenated to normal culture conditions (normoxia, 95% air, 5% CO2) for the indicated periods of time. As shown in Fig. 1A, after 3 h of reoxygenation the cell death was significantly increased compared with the cells in normoxia. Next we tested the hypothesis that cell death induced by H/R occurred via apoptosis, which is a caspase-mediated event. Flow cytometric analysis with PI/annexin-V double staining revealed that, after 24 h of continuous hypoxia, followed by 24 h of reoxygenation, 10–15% of the MLEC cells were apoptotic (Fig. 1B). After 24 h of hypoxia, followed by 3 h of reoxygenation, caspase-9 and -3 were activated (Fig. 1C). Based on these results we concluded that H/R induced caspase activation resulting in a time-dependent apoptotic cell death in MLEC. H/R-induced Apoptosis Activates Both Bax and Bid—To elucidate the pathways involved in H/R-induced apoptosis in MLEC, we measured the DISC formation and the expression of Bax and Bid in MLEC during H/R. The formation of the DISC, as represented by the association of caspase-8 with Fas, occurred as an early event in H/R-induced injury. DISC formation reached an apparent maximum immediately following the hypoxia treatment and decayed rapidly within 1 h of reoxygenation (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, both Bax and Bid were detected following H/R. Bax levels were highest at 12–24 h of reoxygenation following 24 h of hypoxia. The p15-truncated Bid (activated form) could be detected after hypoxia and then increased during the reoxygenation phase in a time-dependent manner. Bcl-XL Was Down-regulated during Reoxygenation—The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibit Bax- and/or Bid-induced apoptosis by blocking mitochondrial cytochrome c release that occurs in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli (4Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 14Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). We examined the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL during H/R in MLEC. Bcl-XL levels did not change during hypoxia, relative to normoxic controls, but were down-regulated after 3 h of reoxygenation (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the expression levels of Bcl-2 (Fig. 2D), FLIP, and Bak (Fig. 2E) did not change during the entire H/R treatment. These results suggest that Bcl-XL but not Bcl-2 participates in the modulation of apoptotic MLEC injury and death during reoxygenation. HGF Protects MLEC from H/R-induced Cell Death by Blocking Bax Translocation and Inhibiting Bid Activation—We examined the effect of HGF treatment (50 ng/ml) on H/R-induced apoptosis in MLEC. As shown in Fig. 3A, HGF treatment significantly protected (p < 0.01) MLEC from cell death induced by H/R. Given that H/R induces MLEC apoptosis via both Bax- and Bid-dependent pathways and HGF significantly decreases H/R-induced cell death, we hypothesized that HGF might inhibit both apoptotic pathways. We found that HGF blocked the mitochondrial translocation of Bax (Fig. 3B) and totally inhibited Bid cleavage (Fig. 3C). This HGF-mediated blockage of Bax translocation was not the result of a decrease in the level of Bax protein following these treatments because analysis of these same cell lysates indicated no change in the overall protein levels of Bax (Fig. 3B). HGF Inhibited Bid Cleavage by Decreasing DISC Formation and Up-regulating FLIP Expression—To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in HGF-mediated inhibition of Bid cleavage, we tested the hypothesis that HGF may block the formation of the DISC. H/R enhances the expression of Fas ligand (1Vogt M. Bauer M.K. Ferrari D. Schulze-Osthoff K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Martin-Villalba A. Habazettl H. Schenkel J. Boekstegers P. Debatin K.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), which may trigger the Fas-driven apoptotic pathway. We examined the status of apoptotic mediators starting with the most proximal events in the Fas-induced apoptotic pathway, the hallmark of which is DISC formation. Activation of Fas results in receptor oligomerization and the rapid recruitment of Fas-associated death domain and caspase-8 to the cytoplasmic death domain of Fas. We treated the cells with HGF (50 ng/ml) for various times in low serum media (0.5% fetal bovine serum). As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment with hypoxia resulted in the formation of the DISC. Recruitment of caspase-8 to Fas was detectable after hypoxia but not under conditions of HGF treatment (Fig. 4A). Given that hypoxia activates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and that DISC formation can be decreased by HGF, we hypothesized that HGF may inhibit caspase-8 activation by modulation of a caspase-8 inhibitor such as FLIP. Indeed, HGF induced the levels of FLIP protein after hypoxia and during the reoxygenation phase (Fig. 4B). To gain further insight into the role of FLIP in H/R, we applied exogenous human FLIP to MLEC by adenoviral infection using adenoviral LacZ as a control. After 2 days the transfected cells were treated with H/R and assayed for apoptosis. The expression of FLIP in transfected cells is shown in Fig. 5A. As shown in Fig. 5B, FLIP significantly inhibited cell death (p < 0.05) after hypoxia. The amount of living cells was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the FLIP-infected cultures than in the LacZ-infected cultures after 3 h of reoxygenation. HGF Blocked Bax Translocation via the p38 MAPK Signaling Pathway—MAPK are signaling intermediaries that allow eukaryotic cells to interpret and respond to multiple stimuli. The p38 MAPK pathway has been traditionally associated with the stress and immune responses and more recently with the regulation of apoptosis and some differentiation processes (15Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). HGF may activate p38 MAPK in different cell types (16Cartwright J.E. Tse W.K. Whitley G.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Muller M. Morotti A. Ponzetto C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1060-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms of the blockage of Bax translocation by HGF, we used three inhibitors, PD98059, a selective MEK1 inhibitor; wortmannin, which acts on the ATP binding site of PI3K and blocks the Akt signaling pathway; and SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK. After culturing the MLEC for 12 h in low serum, the compounds were added and incubated for 2 h before HGF treatment. We found that HGF can promote the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 6A). HGF inhibited Bax translocation via activation of p38 MAPK because Bax translocation could be completely reactivated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (Fig. 6B). The PI3K/Akt inhibitor, wortmannin, slightly reactivated HGF-inhibitable Bax translocation. Furthermore, HGF can block Bid cleavage (Fig. 6B). The MEK/ERK 1/2 signaling pathways were apparently not involved in the suppression of Bax translocation by HGF (Fig. 6B). SB203580 aggravated H/R-induced cell injury and prevented HGF from protecting against H/R-induced cell injury (Fig. 6C). The ability of HGF to protect against H/R-induced cell injury was also compromised by wortmannin; however, this compound did not modulate H/R-induced cell injury in the absence of HGF. These data suggest that p38 MAPK kinase plays a critical role in H/R-induced cell injury. PI3K/Akt may play a partial role in HGF-mediated protection. HGF Stabilizes Bcl-XL Protein Levels after Reoxygenation—It is well known that Bcl-XL can block mitochondrial release of cytochrome c induced by Bax or Bid. Here, Bcl-XL was down-regulated after 3 h of reoxygenation (Fig. 2D). After treatment of MLEC with 50 ng/ml HGF, Bcl-XL protein was stable during reoxygenation compared with the cells that did not receive HGF treatment (Fig. 6D). These results suggest that another mechanism of HGF-mediated cytoprotection in MLEC may involve enhanced Bcl-XL expression, which inhibits Bax- and Bid-induced apoptotic cell death despite the mitochondrial translocation of these species. The lung serves as the portal for O2 delivery to the body, and the physiological mechanisms it adopts in response to hypoxia regulate the quantity of O2 that is delivered to other organs. Acute exposure to hypoxia leads to vasoconstriction of resistance-sized pulmonary arteries, increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, and a redistribution of blood flow from the basal to the apical portion of the lung (18Hansen T.N. Le Blanc A.L. Gest A.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1985; 58: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). H/R, which generates cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and promotes the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes, causes lung injury and cell death involving both necrotic and apoptotic events. Endothelial cells appear to be the first cell type injured by reactive oxygen species generated during I/R (19Sunnergen K.P. Rovetto M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: H1211-H1217PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms of apoptotic cell death induced by H/R, however, are not well understood, especially in endothelial cells. Consistent with previous studies (4Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), H/R treatments enhanced Bax translocation in MLEC without significantly changing total Bax protein levels (12Yamamoto K. Morishita R. Hayashi S. Matsushita H. Nakagami H. Moriguchi A. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The modulation of Bax translocation during H/R is not understood. The Bax induced by H/R is subject to inhibition by Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-XL, which block cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (4Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that the Bid-mediated mitochondrial pathway is critical to ischemic neuronal apoptosis and focal cerebral ischemia in a murine model (20Plesnila N. Zinkel S. Le D.A. Amin-Hanjani S. Wu Y. Qiu J. Chiarugi A. Thomas S.S. Kohane D.S. Korsmeyer S.J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence that the Bid-mediated apoptotic pathway was activated in MLEC during H/R, especially at early time points. The precise mechanism by which Bid is proteolytically activated in the lung after hypoxia is unclear at the present time. Several intracellular molecules, including caspase-8, granzyme B, and caspase-3, can activate Bid. The most efficient mechanism for Bid cleavage in various cell types is the Fas/Fas-associated death domain/caspase-8 pathway, which also appears to be a major pathway for Bid cleavage in MLEC. An increased expression of Fas ligand was observed during H/R in other cell types (1Vogt M. Bauer M.K. Ferrari D. Schulze-Osthoff K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Martin-Villalba A. Habazettl H. Schenkel J. Boekstegers P. Debatin K.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and in MLEC during the present study. We observed DISC formation after hypoxia (Fig. 2A), which cleaves caspase-8 to an active form that subsequently cleaves Bid. The proteolysis of Bid by caspase-3 may represent an important feedback loop for the amplification of apoptotic cell death (21Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). After6hof reoxygenation the caspase-8 in the DISC was significantly decreased (Fig. 4) because a similar amount of the truncated p15 Bid could be detected at 6 and 12 h of reoxygenation (Fig. 2C) in MLEC. Therefore the role of caspase-3 as a direct activator of Bid in H/R may be considered but not at the early times of cell injury (22Yin X.M. Luo Y. Cao G. Bai L. Pei W. Kuharsky D.K. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42074-42081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). HGF is present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of normal adult rats and is responsible for most of the mitogenic effects of lavage fluid on alveolar epithelial cells (23Mason R.J. McCormick-Shannon K. Rubin J.S. Nakamura T. Leslie C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L46-L53PubMed Google Scholar). HGF expression increased in whole lung in a rat model of I/R (24Yamada T. Hisanaga M. Nakajima Y. Mizuno S. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Nakano H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this model, whole lung HGF mRNA increased by 24 h after I/R, followed by an increase in whole lung HGF protein that peaked at day 3 after I/R. Administration of an anti-HGF antibody aggravated I/R lung injury and reduced postinjury DNA synthesis in the lung, suggesting that endogenous HGF plays an important role in the reparative response to lung injury (24Yamada T. Hisanaga M. Nakajima Y. Mizuno S. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Nakano H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HGF has been reported to be a survival factor for endothelial cells (25Ma H. Calderon T.M. Fallon J.T. Berman J.W. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 164: 79-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and protects against human endothelial cell death during H/R in vitro (12Yamamoto K. Morishita R. Hayashi S. Matsushita H. Nakagami H. Moriguchi A. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We report here that HGF significantly prevents MLEC death during H/R (Fig. 3A). Collectively, from the results of our study and previously published reports, it appears that HGF inhibits I/R- or H/R-induced apoptosis by inhibition of DISC formation, inhibition of Bax translocation, and enhancement of Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-XL expression. HGF increased the expression of FLIP protein (Fig. 4B), which can inhibit MLEC death after hypoxia and after reoxygenation (Fig. 5B). FLIP is a cytoplasmic protein with sequence homology to caspase-8. FLIP is capable of binding to Fas-associated death domain yet cannot undergo cleavage to an active caspase because of a substitution of a tyrosine for an active site cysteine, thus preventing the initiation of the death pathway (26Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). Cells with high levels of FLIP relative to caspase-8 are generally resistant to apoptosis (27Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Therefore, HGF inhibits Bid cleavage completely in MLEC during H/R (Fig. 3C). FLIP is regulated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (28Panka D.J. Mano T. Suhara T. Walsh K. Mier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6893-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Whereas the PI3K/Akt inhibitor wortmannin slightly reversed the effect of HGF on Bax activation (Fig. 6B), we did not detect a significant modulation of Akt activation in MLEC with HGF treatment (data not shown). HGF inhibits Bax mitochondrial translocation induced by high d-glucose concentration in endothelial cells (29Nakagami H. Morishita R. Yamamoto K. Taniyama Y. Aoki M. Yamasaki K. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2604-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, we show here that HGF blocks Bax translocation in MLEC during H/R, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In the presence of HGF, the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, reactivated the mitochondrial translocation of Bax and abolished the cytoprotective effect of HGF. In the absence of HGF inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB203580 increased H/R-induced cell death. These results indicate that p38 MAPK plays a critical role in H/R-induced cellular apoptosis. Our data suggest that both Bid and Bax are involved in apoptotic cell death but with potentially different roles. The importance of Bid may increase during the hypoxic phase and at early reoxygenation times whereas Bax may be important at later reoxygenation times, and likely does not cause cell death during the hypoxic phase. The antiapoptotic molecules in the Bcl-2 family (i.e. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) may be down-regulated in several cell types during H/R (30Saikumar P. Dong Z. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3341-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). HGF significantly increased Bcl-2 in human endothelial cells (12Yamamoto K. Morishita R. Hayashi S. Matsushita H. Nakagami H. Moriguchi A. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and increased Bcl-XL in MLEC (Fig. 6D). HGF triggers the phosphorylation and inactivation of the proapoptotic Bad protein via the PI3K/Akt pathway and simultaneously up-regulates Bcl-XL (31Liu Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F624-F633PubMed Google Scholar). HGF blocked the induction of apoptosis by various DNA-damaging agents in breast cancer cells by preventing down-regulation of Bcl-XL (32Fan S. Wang J.A. Yuan R.Q. Rockwell S. Andres J. Zlatapolskiy A. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The modulation of Bcl-XL by HGF potentially involves three possible pathways, PI3K-dependent inactivation of Bad, NFκB activation (33Chen F. Demers L.M. Vallyathan V. Lu Y. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35591-35595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and up-regulation of Bcl-XL through unknown mechanisms. Recently, HGF has been reported to activate the signal transduction pathway for up-regulation of Bcl-XL but not the PI3K-dependent pathway (11Nakamura T. Mizuno S. Matsumoto K. Sawa Y. Matsuda H. Nakamura T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1511-11519Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 34Kitta K. Day R.M. Kim Y. Torregroza I. Evans T. Suzuki Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4705-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the results reported here. In summary, we have examined apoptotic cell death in primary cultures of MLEC exposed to H/R stress and found that both extrinsic (Fas/caspase-8/Bid) and intrinsic (Bax/mitochondrial) pathways are involved. HGF can inhibit apoptotic cell death by increasing FLIP, which antagonizes DISC formation, thereby inhibiting caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage. HGF also blocks Bax mitochondrial translocation and enhances the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL, which is down-regulated during reoxygenation."

Cell surface receptors act through a complex regulatory molecular network that includes guanine exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase activating proteins, and guanine dissociation inhibitors to achieve the coordinated activation and deactivation of Rho proteins, thereby controlling cell motility and ultimately cell fate. Here we found that a member of the RGL-containing family of Rho guanine exchange factors, PDZ RhoGEF, which, together with LARG and p115RhoGEF, links the G12/13 family of heterotrimeric G proteins to Rho activation, binds through its C-terminal region to the serine-threonine kinase p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4), an effector for Cdc42. This interaction results in the phosphorylation of PDZ RhoGEF and abolishes its ability to mediate the accumulation of Rho-GTP by Gα13. Moreover, when overexpressed, active PAK4 was able to dramatically decrease Rho-GTP loading in vivo and the formation of actin stress fibers in response to serum or LPA stimulation. Together, these results provide evidence that PAK4 can negatively regulate the activation of Rho through a direct protein-protein interaction with G protein-linked Rho GEFs, thus providing a novel potential mechanism for cross-talk among Rho GTPases.

Together, these results provide evidence that PAK4 can negatively regulate the activation of Rho through a direct protein-protein interaction with G protein-linked Rho GEFs, thus providing a novel potential mechanism for cross-talk among Rho GTPases. Rho GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, play a key role in the regulation of cellular processes that involve actin cytoskeleton remodeling, such as cell migration, polarity, morphogenesis, and axon guidance (1Van Aelst L. Symons M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1032-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar), as well as in the control of gene expression and cell cycle progression (3Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar, 4Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

Although these GTPases are often studied in diverse biochemical and biological systems individually, emerging evidence suggests that Rho proteins act as part of a complex and highly coordinated signaling network. Indeed, in certain cellular systems Cdc42 can cause the hierarchical activation of Rac and Rho (6Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar). Most often, however, the activation of one Rho GTPase can prevent the activation or the effector function of another Rho GTPase. For example, in neuronal cells, Cdc42 antagonizes the effects of Rho in growth cone chemo-repulsion (7Yuan X.B. Jin M. Xu X. Song Y.Q. Wu C.P. Poo M.M. Duan S. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2003; 5: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and in motile cells, Rac prevents the phosphorylation of myosin light chain through its effector PAK1 by phosphorylating myosin light chain kinase, thus decreasing the contractile effect exerted by Rho (8Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This particular process balances the protrusive forces, generated by Rac and Cdc42, and the contractile forces, promoted by Rho, a critical requirement for directional cell movement (9Burridge K. Science. 1999; 283: 2028-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to counteracting the downstream effectors of Rho, Rac can lead to a decrease of active GTP-bound Rho by the generation of reactive oxygen species, which act as diffusible second messengers by promoting the inhibition of a low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (10Nimnual A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). That results in the prolonged phosphorylation and activity of p190 RhoGAP, thus inhibiting Rho by promoting the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Rho (10Nimnual A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Together, these recent findings revealed the existence of a complex interplay among Rho GTPases, whose underlying molecular mechanisms are just beginning to be understood. The activity of Rho GTPases is tightly regulated by guanine exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine exchange factorsDHDbl homologyPHpleckstrin homologyPRGPDZ RhoGEFp115p115 RhoGEFRGLregulator of G protein signaling-likePDZPSD-95/DlgA/Z0-1 binding domainPAK4p21 activated kinase 4PAK4-CC-terminal part of PAK4HAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseGST-RBDGTP-dependent binding domain of rhotekinwtwild typeRBDrhotekin binding domainLPAl-α-lysophosphatidic acidPBSphosphate buffered salineADGAL4 transactivation domainX-α-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-2-d-galactopyranosideCRIBCdc42/Rac interactive binding domainMBPmyelin basic protein.1The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine exchange factorsDHDbl homologyPHpleckstrin homologyPRGPDZ RhoGEFp115p115 RhoGEFRGLregulator of G protein signaling-likePDZPSD-95/DlgA/Z0-1 binding domainPAK4p21 activated kinase 4PAK4-CC-terminal part of PAK4HAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseGST-RBDGTP-dependent binding domain of rhotekinwtwild typeRBDrhotekin binding domainLPAl-α-lysophosphatidic acidPBSphosphate buffered salineADGAL4 transactivation domainX-α-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-2-d-galactopyranosideCRIBCdc42/Rac interactive binding domainMBPmyelin basic protein. that promote GDP release, leading to GTP loading and activation of Rho proteins, and by GTPase activating proteins and GDP-dissociation inhibitors that act as negative regulators by either accelerating the intrinsic GTPase activity or by preventing their release of GDP, respectively (11Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 12Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Rho GEFs are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) module that is responsible for the exchange activity toward Rho proteins (12Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). These GEFs include a number of distinct functional domains that enable them to interact with and be regulated by a diverse array of cell surface and cytoplasmic molecules, thus mediating the activation of Rho GTPases in response to external or intracellular signals (12Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Of interest, PDZ RhoGEF (PRG), LARG, and p115 RhoGEF (p115) represent a distinct GEF family that is characterized by the presence of a regulator of G protein signaling-like (RGL) domain by which they bind the α-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins of the G12/13 protein family and thereby increasing their GEF activity toward Rho (13Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 14Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1661-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). PRG and LARG can also associate through their peptide-binding domain Z (PDZ) domains with the insulin-like growth factor receptor (15Taya S. Inagaki N. Sengiku H. Makino H. Iwamatsu A. Urakawa I. Nagao K. Kataoka S. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and Plexin B (16Perrot V. Vazquez-Prado J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), an axon-guiding semaphorin receptor, thus suggesting that their GEF activity can be regulated by complex protein-protein interactions. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the ability of these Rho GEFs to induce Rho activation are still poorly defined. guanine exchange factors Dbl homology pleckstrin homology PDZ RhoGEF p115 RhoGEF regulator of G protein signaling-like PSD-95/DlgA/Z0-1 binding domain p21 activated kinase 4 C-terminal part of PAK4 hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase GTP-dependent binding domain of rhotekin wild type rhotekin binding domain l-α-lysophosphatidic acid phosphate buffered saline GAL4 transactivation domain 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-2-d-galactopyranoside Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain myelin basic protein. guanine exchange factors Dbl homology pleckstrin homology PDZ RhoGEF p115 RhoGEF regulator of G protein signaling-like PSD-95/DlgA/Z0-1 binding domain p21 activated kinase 4 C-terminal part of PAK4 hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase GTP-dependent binding domain of rhotekin wild type rhotekin binding domain l-α-lysophosphatidic acid phosphate buffered saline GAL4 transactivation domain 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-2-d-galactopyranoside Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain myelin basic protein. Recently, we have observed that the C-terminal region of PRG, LARG, and p115 mediates their ability to homo- and hetero-oligomerize (18Chikumi H. Barac A. Behbahani B. Gao Y. Teramoto H. Zheng Y. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of their C termini enhances the ability of these GEFs to activate Rho in vivo and unleashes their high transforming potential, thus supporting the view that the C-terminal region represses the function of these GEFs in vivo (18Chikumi H. Barac A. Behbahani B. Gao Y. Teramoto H. Zheng Y. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that this C-terminal inhibitory region of PRG associates specifically with p21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4), a Cdc42 effector, which leads to a decreased activation of Rho in vivo by Gα13 and its coupled receptors. These findings suggest the existence of a novel biochemical route by which PAKs can regulate the activation of Rho, thus providing a direct mechanism for the cross-talk among small GTPases of the Rho family. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A human brain cDNA library was screened using the Matchmaker system III (Clontech, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The C-terminal region of PRG (amino acids 1081-1523) was cloned in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain into pGBKT7 vector and used as the bait. Transformants were grown under high stringency conditions using growth media lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan (Clontech, CA). Specificity of the interaction was confirmed by using expression plasmids pGADT7-T and pGBKT-53 as control prey and control bait, respectively. An X-α-gal assay was performed as per manufacturer's instructions. Constructs—The C-terminal part of PAK4 (amino acids 252-597), PAK4-C, was subcloned from the library expression plasmid pACT2 into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV myc (Clontech, CA) as an EcoRI-BglII fragment.

The PCR product was ligated into HindIII and NotI restriction sites of pCEFL myc and pCEFL hemagglutinin (HA) expression vectors to obtain pCEFL myc PAK4 and pCEFL HA PAK4, respectively. PAK4 445N and PAK4 350 m mutants were generated by changing Ser-445 to Asn-445 or Lys-350 to Met-350, respectively, using QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The expression plasmids for AU1-tagged PRG, p115 Rho GEF, LARG, PRG deletion mutants (Δ702, ΔDH-PH and ΔC), the DH-PH domain (DH-PH, amino acids 702-1160), and the HA-tagged C-terminal region of PRG (PRG-C, amino acids 1081-1523) were described previously (18Chikumi H.

Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with the lysis buffer.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), using purified GST-RBD previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (Amersham Pharmacia, Sweden) beads to affinity-precipitated GTP-bound Rho. Western blot analysis of total and active Rho was performed by using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (26C4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fluorescence Microscopy—Swiss 3T3 cells were grown in six-well plates on cover-slips and transfected with pCEFL HA PAK4 445N, pCEFL HA PAK4 350 m, or the control expression vector. Cells were serum-starved for 36 h and then stimulated with 0.5 μm LPA (Sigma) or serum (10%) for 20 min, washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Cover-slips were washed with PBS three times, blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with mouse anti-HA antibody (1:200) for one hour. After incubation, cover-slips were washed with PBS three times and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse-IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for one hour. Cells were then washed with PBS and stained with Texas Red-X phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Coverslips were mounted by using Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and visualized by using an Axioplan2 microscope (Zeiss). As the C-terminal region of PRG has an important role in the regulation of its in vivo GEF activity, we searched for potential interacting proteins by a yeast two-hybrid approach, using the C-terminal 341 amino acids of PRG (Fig. 1A, PRG-C) fused in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain as bait to screen a human brain GAL4 transactivation domain (AD) fusion cDNA library. Upon screening 0.8 × 106 independent transformants, we identified only few clones that exhibited efficient growth under high stringency conditions, such as growth in the absence of adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan (-AHLT). Of interest, one clone encoded for the entire C-terminal kinase domain of the serine-threonine p21-activated kinase 4 (Fig. 1A, PAK4-C). The specificity of this interaction was first verified in yeasts where expression plasmids for PAK4-C and SV40 large T antigen fused to GAL4 AD were cotransformed with either PRG-C or p53 fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain and tested for their ability to grow on -AHLT plates in the presence of X-α-Gal. As shown in Fig. 1A, only transformants expressing a known interacting pair, p53 and the large T antigen, or expressing the PRG-C together with PAK4-C were able to grow at high stringency conditions and turn the yeast colonies blue in the presence of X-α-Gal, indicating the expression of the α-galactosidase promoter. To investigate whether PAK4-C and PRG-C can also interact in eukaryotic cells, we transfected expression plasmids for a myc-tagged PAK4-C and HA-tagged PRG-C in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, these proteins were readily detectable by Western blotting with the corresponding anti-tag antibodies, and HA PRG-C co-immunoprecipitated with myc PAK4-C from co-transfected cells but not from control lysates. In line with these observations, this interaction was also observed when using the corresponding tagged full-length proteins, HA PAK4 and AU1 PRG (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, when AU1 PRG was expressed in 293T cells, it also interacted with endogenous PAK4 protein (Fig. 1D). PAK4 is a member of the p21-activated kinase family that consists of at least six members, which can be divided into two groups based on their structural features and sequence similarities (Fig. 2A). Group I includes PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3; they share a Cdc42/Rac, p21 binding domain (PBD), an autoinhibitory domain, and a kinase domain; PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6 represent a recently described group II of PAKs that shares a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain (CRIB) domain and a related kinase domain but lacks an autoinhibitory region (25Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Whereas PAK2 and PAK4 are widely expressed, other members of these groups exhibit a tissue-restricted distribution (25Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To examine whether PRG can also interact with members of group I of the PAKs, we co-expressed in 293T cells AU1 PRG together with myc-tagged PAK1 or V5-tagged PAK2 and HA-tagged PAK4 as a control. After anti-AU1 immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with the specific anti-tag antibodies, we observed that only PAK4 associated with PRG (Fig. 2A). Next, we tested whether other RGL-containing GEFs, LARG and p115, can bind PAK4 (Fig. 2B). As judged by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, PAK4 was able to bind strongly only to PRG, whereas it showed much weaker binding to p115 and no interaction with LARG. Collectively, these experiments supported the preferential interaction between PAK4 and PRG. To map more precisely the domains intervening in the binding of PAK4 to PRG, we co-expressed myc-tagged PAK4 together with the AU1- or HA-tagged deletion mutants of PRG indicated in Fig. 2C. Myc-PAK4 was able to bind to full-length PRG, PRG lacking its N-terminal 702 amino acids (Fig. 2C, Δ702), or its DH-PH domains (Fig. 2C, ΔDH-PH), but its ability to bind PRG was abolished when the C-terminal portion of PRG was deleted (Fig. 2C, ΔC). Furthermore, PRG C terminus alone (Fig. 2C, PRG-C) was able to bind to myc PAK4 when co-expressed in 293T cells, whereas the DH-PH domain (DH/PH) could not be detected in the anti-myc immunoprecipitates. Together, these results indicated that the C-terminal region of PRG is required and sufficient to bind PAK4. To assess the functional significance of PAK4-PRG interaction, we engineered a constitutively active mutant of PAK4 (HA PAK4 S445N). This mutation has been reported previously to stabilize the catalytic loop and elevate strongly the kinase activity of PAK4 toward His-4 (26Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, when HA-tagged versions of the wild type and active PAK4 were expressed in 293T cells and tested for kinase activity, the activated form of PAK4 showed much higher MBP and auto-phosphorylating activity than wt PAK4 (Fig. 3A). We also tested the activity of a kinase inactive PAK4 mutant (PAK4 350 m) that contains a methionine residue in place of a conserved lysine in subdomain II, which disrupts the ability of PAK4 to bind ATP and, thus, its kinase activity. Consistent with previous reports (27Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), PAK4 350 m was unable to autophosphorylate and had low MBP phosphorylating activity. Next, we examined whether activated PAK4 was able to bind PRG protein in vitro. As the most C-terminal amino acids of PRG participate in the association with PAK4, this region from PRG, and LARG as a control, were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins (GST PRG-C and GST LARG-C), purified and coupled to Sepharose beads. Using these purified proteins, we observed that PRG-C, but not similar amounts of LARG-C (Fig. 3B, Comassie stain), was able to affinity-precipitate HA PAK4 445N (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the “pulled down” PAK4 strongly phosphorylated PRG-C when kinase reactions were performed on the precipitates (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the C-terminal part of PRG binds PAK4 and serves as a PAK4 substrate. We then co-transfected full-length AU1 PRG with HA PAK4 445N in 293T cells to examine whether active PAK4 kinase can phosphorylate PRG in vivo. As an approach, we used both a polyclonal anti-phosphothreonine antibody that recognizes phosphorylated threonines independently of the neighboring amino acids, and an anti-phosphoserine antiserum that was raised against a consensus (R/K)X(phosphoS)(Hyd)(R/K) motif. This motif shows high homology to the amino acid sequence within the activation loop of PAK4 (RKSLV, amino acids 472-476) that has been shown to be a high affinity in vitro substrate for the kinase (28Callow M.G. Clairvoyant F. Zhu S. Schryver B. Whyte D.B. Bischoff J.R. Jallal B. Smeal T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 550-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and thus could represent a likely PAK4 phosphorylation motif; this possibility is suggested by the observation that the anti-R/KXpSHydR/K antiserum recognized the autophosphorylated PAK4 (not shown). When anti-AU1 precipitates were probed with anti-phosphothreonine and anti-phosphoserine (Fig. 3C), we observed a strong increase in threonine phosphorylation on PRG in the presence of active PAK4, which was even more remarkable for serine phosphorylation within that consensus site. Together, these results suggested that PRG may represent an in vivo substrate for PAK4 kinase. As an approach to address the consequences of PAK4 interaction with RGL-containing GEFs, we tested whether PAK4 may interfere with the signaling ability of receptors and G protein α-subunits that utilize these GEFs to stimulate Rho. One of the hallmarks of Rho activation is the rapid formation of actin stress fibers as a result of LPA or serum stimulation (6Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar), a process that is dependent upon the activation of the G12/13 family of heterotrimeric G proteins and the subsequent stimulation of RGL-containing RhoGEFs (29An S. Goetzl E.J. Lee H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; : 147-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To explore whether PAK4 affects LPA-induced Rho activation, we treated control-transfected HA PAK4 445N and HA PAK4 350 m-transfected Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with LPA and examined the cytoskeletal changes by staining polymerized actin. As expected, LPA and serum treatment of control-transfected fibroblasts led to a rapid change in cell shape and appearance of stress fibers (Fig. 4A and data not shown). These events were abolished in cells transfected with HA PAK4 445N. However, transfection of PAK4 350 m did not affect LPA-induced morphological changes, indicating that the kinase activity of PAK4 is required for the inhibition of stress fiber formation. To test whether the inhibition of stress fiber formation occurs upstream or downstream to Rho, we examined LPA-induced accumulation of endogenous Rho-GTP in vivo in 293T cells in the presence or absence of activated PAK4. As shown in Fig. 4B, using a Rhotekin pull-down assay (30Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that LPA stimulation led to a strong increase in Rho GTP-loading. Interestingly, Rho-GTP levels were dramatically reduced upon expression of activated PAK4 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that PAK4 can, indeed, interfere with the ability of LPA to induce Rho activation. A similar inhibitory effect of active PAK4 on Rho activation was also observed in response to serum (Fig. 4C). To examine more directly whether PAK4 interferes with the ability of the G12/13 proteins to stimulate the guanine exchange activity toward Rho, we measured the generation of Rho-GTP levels in 293T cells co-transfected with active mutant α-subunit of G13 heterotrimeric protein (HA Gα13QL) together with increasing concentrations of HA PAK4 445N (Fig. 4D). Although transfection of Gα13QL led to a strong increase in Rho-GTP accumulation, the expression of HA PAK4 445N led to a dramatic decrease in the level of Rho-GTP. This effect was even more dramatic considering that increasing concentrations of HA PAK4 445N can consistently promote higher expression of HA-Gα13QL by unknown mechanisms. Together, these experiments provide evidence that PAK4 can act as a negative regulator of the Rho activation pathways induced by Gα13, as well as by LPA and serum, which stimulate Gα12/13-dependent pathways. The nature of the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex interplay among small GTPases of the Rho family is still poorly understood. In search of molecules regulating the activity of a recently described Rho GEF, PRG, we found that PAK4 can bind specifically to its inhibitory C-terminal region. PAK4 can also phosphorylate the PRG C terminus in vitro, and it promotes the phosphorylation of full-length PRG in vivo. Furthermore, we provide evidence that PAK4 can inhibit the stimulation of Rho induced by G12/13-coupled receptors and by the activated forms of Gα13. Thus, the interaction between PAK4 and Rho GEF may represent a direct mechanism by which small GTP-binding proteins acting on PAK4, such as Cdc42 and its related GTPases, may interfere with Rho activation, resulting in the inhibition of stress fiber formation. The precise mechanism by which PAK4 inhibits signal transmission from G protein-coupled receptors and Gα13 proteins to Rho through PRG is still unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that the in vitro activity of RGL-containing Rho GEFs does not fully reflect their likely complex regulation in vivo. For example, these Rho GEFs are poorly activated in vitro by Gα12, despite the strong evidence that Gα12 interacts and activates the GEF activity of this class of Rho GEFs in vivo (13Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 31Wells C.D. Liu M.Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similarly, the removal of the potent inhibitory activity exerted by the C-terminal region of p115, PRG, and LARG in vivo does not result in the enhanced ability of these GEFs to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Rho in vitro (18Chikumi H. Barac A. Behbahani B. Gao Y. Teramoto H. Zheng Y. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In line with the latter findings, phosphorylation of PRG by PAK4 did not affect the in vitro GEF activity of PRG (data not shown). Similarly, we did not detect any changes in the ability of Gα13 to bind PRG upon co-expression with active PAK4, nor did this kinase affect the overall cellular distribution of PRG in the resting state or that in response to Gα13-QL expression. However, we cannot rule out at this time whether PAK4 interferes with the targeting of PRG by activated Gα13 to a particular subcellular fraction or membrane microdomain. On the other hand, PAK4 did not phosphorylate the DH-PH module (data not shown); thus, it is also possible that PAK4 phosphorylation may promote the association of PRG to a yet to be identified negative regulatory molecule, which, for example, may hinder the ability of the catalytic DH-PH domain to interact with Rho in vivo. These, as well as additional possibilities, are under current intense investigation. The observation that PAK4 binds PRG may have important implications for the PAK family of serine-threonine protein kinases, which are key mediators of Rac and Cdc42 function. Of interest, PAK4 is widely expressed and has been shown to interact with Cdc42 and to participate in its cytoskeletal effects by inducing sustained filopodia formation (27Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Active PAK4 also induces a decrease in actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, and may participate in tumor invasion and metastasis (26Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 550-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), but its downstream effectors are still poorly defined (33Dan C. Kelly A. Bernard O. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32115-32121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this regard, our current results indicate that PRG may represent a direct target for PAK4. These findings may help explain how PAK4 inhibits Rho function, as this kinase may limit the accumulation of GTP-bound Rho by inhibiting the activation of Rho GEFs. This unexpected finding raises the possibility that other PAK family members may similarly regulate other Rho GEFs, thereby providing a direct mechanism by which one small GTP-binding protein may affect, either positively or negatively, the activation of another Rho family member. In summary, our observations suggest that signaling pathways regulating PAK4, such as those promoting the activation of Cdc42 and its related GTPases, may interfere directly with the local activation of Rho by inhibiting the activity of a GEF that links heterotrimeric G proteins and their coupled receptors to Rho. This potential molecular mechanism of cross-talk among Rho GTPases, together with recently published reports (10Nimnual A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), support the emerging notion that the activation of Rho GTPases is a highly spatial and temporally coordinated process, which can be achieved by the complex interplay between the downstream targets of one Rho protein and the molecules that regulate the state of activation of another GTPase."

AP-1 is composed of a dimeric combinatorial complex of members of the Jun homodimers (c-Jun, JunD, and JunB) or Jun heterodimer with Fos family members (c-Fos, Fos B, Fra1, and Fra2) (reviewed in Refs. 1Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2334-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and 2Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). The Jun dimerization protein, JDP2, was identified following a two-hybrid screen with c-Jun leucine zipper as bait (3Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). JDP2 is a bona fide member of the basic leucine zipper family. Thus, similar to the Jun family members, JDP2, is able to bind DNA as a homo- and a heterodimer (3Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 4Jin C. Ugai H. Song J. Murata T. Nili F. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Yokoyama K.K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Following dimerization with Jun members, DNA binding is potentiated, but transcription of AP-1-dependent genes is inhibited. JDP2 inhibits transcription by multiple mechanisms that involve competition on DNA binding and generation of inactive AP-1 complexes and act through the indirect recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 (5Jin C. Li H. Murata T. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Chiu R. Yokoyama K.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4815-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). JDP2 is expressed in all cell lines tested, and similar to the other members of the AP-1 family, it is regulated at multiple levels. JDP2 is rapidly phosphorylated on threonine 148 by JNK and p38 in response to stress stimuli (6Katz S. Heinrich R. Aronheim A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Katz S. Aronheim A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The precise role of JDP2 phosphorylation for its biological function is currently unknown. A number of processes such as skeletal muscle cell differentiation (8Ostrovsky O. Bengal E. Aronheim A. J.

JDP2 was found to interact with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-γ, a member of the CAAT family (10Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ATF2 (4Jin C. Ugai H. Song J. Murata T. Nili F. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Yokoyama K.K.

Aronheim A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5451-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). JDP2 serves as a co-activator of transcription for the progesterone receptor via direct interaction with pCAF and p300/CBP co-activators (11Wardell S.E. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Adelman J.S. Aronheim A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5451-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although JDP2 efficiently counteracts AP-1 action (3Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), it was identified as a candidate oncogene in a high throughput viral insertional mutagenesis screen collaborating with p27kip loss of function mutation (12Hwang H.C. Martins C.P. Bronkhorst Y. Randel E. Berns A. Fero M. Clurman B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11293-11298Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, JDP2 was found to transform chicken embryo fibroblast but failed to induce anchorage-independent growth in these cells (13Blazek E. Wasmer S. Kruse U. Aronheim A. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2151-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we show that JDP2 overexpression in NIH3T3 cells inhibits cell transformation by Ras. We also tested the expression levels of JDP2 in a number of human tumors and found that only a minor fraction of tumors express higher levels of JDP2 as compared with normal cells. In addition, we used a hormone-independent prostate carcinoma cell line as a model for tumorogenesis in SCID mice to show that JDP2 strongly inhibits tumor cell growth. JDP2 action as a tumor suppressor gene inhibits AP-1 activity through the increase of JunB, JunD, and Fra2 protein levels and decrease of c-Jun expression.

Retroviruses expressing JDP2 or empty vector (as control) were generated by transfection into a viral packaging cell line 293gp, expressing the gag and pol genes (15Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The medium of transfected 293gp cells containing retroviruses was used to infect PC-3 cells. Infected cells were selected with puromycin (3 μg/ml) and pooled following 2 weeks of selection. Tumor Generation in Mice—SCID mice (7–8 weeks old) were injected subcutaneously with the different PC-3 stable cell lines (107 cells/mouse). Three weeks later, when tumors developed, mice were administered intraperitoneally with 5′-bromo-2′-deoxy-uridine (BrdUrd, catalog no. 280879, Roche Applied Science; 2 mg/10 g of body weight) 2 h before euthanization. Tumors were dissected, weighted, and fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde solution (containing 4% formaldehyde, 0.4% sodium phosphate monobasic, and 0.65% sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—PC3 cell lines (0.5 × 106) were serum-starved for 72 h and then were stimulated with 5% serum for 24 h. Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS at room temperature. Ice-cold absolute ethanol was added (4 ml) for cell fixation with high speed vortexing. Cells were left in ethanol at -20 °C for 15 min. Ethanol was discarded, and cells were rehydrated in PBS and incubated in the presence of 50 μg/ml RNase at 37 °C for 0.5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of staining buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and propidium iodide (Molecular Probes Inc., 1 μg/ml) was added to cell suspension for 15 min at room temperature followed by flow cytometry analysis. TUNEL Staining—Sections were stained by the in situ death detection POD kit (Roche Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer's instructions, modified as described (16Nagler R.M. Kerner H. Laufer D. Ben-Eliezer S. Minkov I. Ben-Itzhak O. Cancer Lett. 2002; 186: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts and nuclear extracts were prepared and collected as described previously (17Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar, 18Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). For protein extraction from tumor slices, ∼1 g of tissue was homogenized in ∼3 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture) followed by a 30-min incubation. Total cell lysates were collected after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins were separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted on a Hybond membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h and subsequently probed with the following primary polyclonal antibodies: anti-c-Jun, anti-JunD, anti-JunB, and anti-Fra2 (all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-JDP2 (3Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used for protein loading control levels. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit or goat-anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were used as secondary antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Biological Industries) according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized by autoradiography. Histology and Immunohistochemical Stainings—Tumor slices derived from injected SCID mice were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned at 6-μm intervals, and mounted on slides (polylysine-coated Super Frost Plus, Menzel-Glaser). Sections were routinely processed for deparaffinization through three washes of xylene followed by graded washings of alcohols (100 and 95%) for 5 min each. Tissue sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for general morphology. For hydration, slides were washed (with 5-min intervals) twice with H2O and once with PBS. For antigen unmasking, sections were heated in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min, and then washed three times (with 5-min intervals) with H2O and once with PBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% fetal calf serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature followed by the addition of anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (DAKO ALS, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:25 in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed with PBS followed by the addition of Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), diluted 1:100 in blocking solution, for 1 h at room temperature. Following three PBS washings, nuclei were stained for 10 min at room temperature with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma, prepared as 1 mg/ml H2O stock and diluted 1:1000 in PBS) followed by washings in PBS. The tumor sections were stained with primary anti-active caspase-3 (R&D Systems Inc.) diluted 1:3000 followed by washing and detected by the streptavidin-biotin complex method as described previously (16Nagler R.M. Kerner H. Laufer D. Ben-Eliezer S. Minkov I. Ben-Itzhak O. Cancer Lett. 2002; 186: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sections were visualized using an Olympus Model BX50 fluorescence microscope at a magnification of ×200 and were photographed with a digital camera. Inhibition of Ras Transformation in NIH3T3 Cells—The overexpression of JDP2 in chicken embryo fibroblast resulted in the loss of contact inhibitory cell growth and generation of foci characteristic of cell transformation (13Blazek E. Wasmer S. Kruse U. Aronheim A. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2151-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To test the ability of JDP2 to transform mammalian cells, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with either pCEFL expression vehicle plasmid or pCEFL expression plasmid encoding for HA-JDP2. Cells were grown to high density for 2 weeks in 5% calf serum. The cells transfected with JDP2 exhibited contact-inhibited growth similar to the vector control-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). This result prompted us to examine the ability of JDP2 to inhibit cell transformation by a well established oncogene. Toward this end, we co-transfected NIH3T3 cells with pCEFL-RasV12 expression plasmid together with either vector control or expression plasmid encoding for JDP2. Although Ras-transfected cells exhibited loss of contact growth inhibition and typical foci formation, cells co-transfected with RasV12 together with JDP2 exhibited a significant reduction in size, and only 16% of the number of foci formed as compared with RasV12 alone (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that JDP2 has a potential to serve as a tumor suppressor gene. JDP2 Expression in Human Tumors—To examine whether differential JDP2 gene expression may be relevant to human cancer, we have used a matched tumor/normal expression array nylon membrane (Clontech) in which cDNA samples derived from 53 patients diagnosed with cancer were immobilized to membrane representing seven different tumors. From each patient, a pair of cDNA samples was derived from the tumor and the corresponding normal tissue as a control. We probed the membrane with radiolabeled hJDP2 cDNA and determined the level of radioactivity obtained in the normal tissue as compared with the level obtained in the tumor. A housekeeping gene, ubiquitin, was used to correct for cDNA loading deviations (Fig. 2). Although 58.4% of patients exhibited no change in JDP2 expression levels, 35.8% of patients exhibited higher levels of expression of JDP2 in normal tissue as compared with the matched tumor tissue. Only a small percentage (5.7%) of patient-derived tumors exhibited significantly higher JDP2 levels in the tumor as compared with the normal tissue. From this analysis, we concluded that JDP2 is more likely to play a role as a tumor suppressor gene. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that in specific genetic lesions, overexpression of JDP2 may be involved in or play a role in tumorogenesis of human cancer. JDP2 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines—Since prostate cancer patients (3 out of 3 patients) exhibited elevated JDP2 levels in normal tissue as compared with the tumor tissues (Fig. 2), we decided to focus our further analysis on prostate cancer cell lines. First, we examined the level of JDP2 and c-Jun protein in Western blots with nuclear extract derived from three different prostate carcinoma cell lines using the corresponding antibodies. Nuclear extract was prepared from LNCaP, representing the androgen-dependent cell line, and two androgen-independent aggressive prostate cancer cell lines, DU-145 and PC-3. Although JDP2 protein levels were found relatively high in LNCaP cells, the expression was much lower in DU-145 and undetectable in PC-3 cell-derived extracts (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Moreover, c-Jun showed reverse correlation with JDP2 expression in these cell lines, i.e. c-Jun was barely detectable in LNCaP cells and in relatively high levels in both DU-145 and PC-3 cell-derived extracts (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Ectopic Expression of JDP2 in a PC-3-derived Cell Line—The androgen-independent prostate cell line, PC-3, exhibited the lowest level of JDP2 expression. Therefore, we next studied the consequence of ectopic expression of JDP2 in these cells. We used either the pBabe retrovirus expression vector control or the pBabe-JDP2 expression vector to infect the 293gp-packging-cell line to produce the corresponding retroviruses. Retroviruses produced were used to infect PC-3 cells that were subsequently selected for puromycin resistance. The cell lines generated were designated PC-Babe and PC-JDP2, respectively. Nuclear extract derived from these cell lines was subjected to Western blot analysis with JDP2-antibodies and tubulin-antibodies. The latter served as loading control. A strong cross-reacting band corresponding to the 18-kDa JDP2 protein was observed in the PC-JDP2-derived extract. The endogenous JDP2 expression level, however, was below the detection sensitivity in the PC-Babe control cell line (Fig. 3B, upper panel). The expression of tubulin was similar in both cell lines (Fig. 3B, bottom panel), suggesting that the high expression of JDP2 in PC-JDP2 cells is the result of stable integration of the virus into the cell genome. The PC-JDP2 cell line exhibited slower growth rate as compared with the PC-Babe control cell line. Culturing cells in the absence (Fig. 4A) or in the presence of 1% serum (Fig. 4B) showed that PC-JDP2 cells have slower growth rate and lower saturation density as compared with PC-Babe control cells. Serum-starved PC-Babe cells stimulated by 5% serum for 24 h exhibited 2- and 5-fold increase in cells entering to S and G2/M phases, respectively, whereas PC-JDP2 cells exhibited only 2.3-fold increase in the number of cells found in G2/M phase. No significant changes were observed in the number of PC-JDP2 cells entering to S phase (Fig. 4C). Moreover, PC-Babe and PC-JDP2 cell lines showed no significant difference in the number of cells found in apoptotic sub-G1 phase. Taken together, these results suggest that JDP2 overexpression resulted in an inhibition of cell growth in vitro. JDP2 Inhibits Cell Growth of PC-3 Cells in SCID Mice—To examine whether the slower growth rate of cells ectopically expressing JDP2 also reduced their tumorogenic potential, we injected 107 cells subcutaneously into SCID mice and followed tumor growth 3 weeks after injection. In control mice injected with PC-Babe cells, large tumors were readily observed, whereas in mice injected with PC-JDP2 cells, significantly smaller tumors as compared with PC-Babe-injected mice were observed (Fig. 5, A and B). Tumors were dissected from a total of 12 mice, and the weight of each tumor was determined (Fig. 5, C and D). The tumors derived from PC-JDP2-injected mice were significantly smaller in size (3.7-fold) as compared with tumors derived from PC-Babe-injected mice. In addition, the histology of the tumor derived from PC-Babe-injected mice showed densely packed cells and congested capillaries, whereas in the PC-JDP2-injected tumors, the cells were more dispersed within the tissue, and the capillaries appeared normal (Fig. 5, E and F). Both PC-Babe- and PC-JDP2-derived tumors were defined as solid, anaplastic, infiltrative, with a high Gleason-grade of 10 (5 + 5)/10 (19Gleason D.F. Mellinger G.T. J. Urol. 1974; 111: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). To determine the proliferation rate of the tumors, mice were administered with BrdUrd at 2 h prior to euthanization. Tumors were fixed, and paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with anti-BrdUrd antibodies (Fig. 6, A and B). Although 34% of cells derived from PC-Babe-injected tumors were positive for BrdUrd incorporation, only about 2% of cells derived from PC-JDP2-injected tumors showed proliferation capacity (Fig. 6C). Since smaller tumor size can result from increase in cell death as well, we examined apoptosis in PC-Babe- and PC-JDP2-derived tumor sections for activated caspase-3 and by TUNEL assay (Fig. 6D). In both assays, no significant changes were observed between PC-Babe- and PC-JDP2-stained sections, suggesting that cell proliferation is more likely to explain the differences in tumor size.Fig. 6JDP2-dependent suppression of DNA synthesis in PC-3-derived tumors. Mice described in the legend for Fig. 5 were administered intraperitoneally with BrdUrd (2 mg/10 g of body weight) 2 h prior to tumor dissection and fixation in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde. Paraffin-embedded tissues from mice injected with PC-Babe (A) and PC-JDP2 (B) were immunostained with anti-BrdUrd antibodies (red staining). Cell nuclei were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue staining). Representative co-stained fields are shown. As shown in C, BrdUrd-labeled cells were counted relative to the number of nuclei. The results presented were derived from tumors excised from 12 mice in which at least 20 fields consisting of 200 cells each and represent the mean ± S.D. BrdU, BrdUrd.

Total cell lysate of the tumors was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-JDP2 antibodies (Fig. 7A). Consistent with the expression of JDP2 in the PC-JDP2 cell line, JDP2 was highly expressed in the tumor. In addition, we measured the level of expression of several AP-1 family members using Western blot analysis. We observed increased levels of JunB, JunD, and Fra2 (Fig. 7A), whereas c-Jun levels were dramatically decreased. Consistent with this, we observed an increase in total human collagenase-TRE DNA binding activity in lysate derived from PC-JDP2-derived tumor (Fig. 7B). This result suggests that ectopic expression of JDP2 resulted in the generation of a well established anti-proliferative AP-1 complex. JDP2 was shown to repress transcription from TRE and cAMP-responsive element DNA elements and to inhibit AP-1-dependent transcription activity (3Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Although the role of AP-1 in cell proliferation and cancer is well established (2Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar), the role of JDP2 in malignant cell transformation is currently under debate. In the above study, we provide strong evidence for the role of JDP2 in inhibition of tumorigenesis. First, JDP2 efficiently inhibited Ras-dependent cell transformation in NIH3T3 cells. Second, we showed that in a human tumor panel consisting of 53 patients, only a small fraction (5.7%) of cancer patients display higher expression of JDP2 in the tumors as compared with the normal tissues. In the latter case, it is unlikely that the high levels of JDP2 are responsible for the initiation of tumorogenesis but are probably the result of the tumor progression or are important for tumor maintenance. Understanding the mechanism for JDP2 overexpression in those tumors is of great importance since JDP2 may have tumor suppressor function in other tumors, and therefore, manipulating JDP2 expression levels may be used to inhibit malignant transformation. Third, interestingly, we observed a high incidence of loss of JDP2 expression in prostate cancer patients (representing prostate adenocarcinoma) and in cell lines (PC-3 and DU-145) representing more aggressive and progressive stages of the disease. Importantly, ectopic expression of JDP2 in PC-3 significantly reduced its proliferative properties both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, no significant differences were observed when apoptotic markers were examined, therefore suggesting that cell proliferation but not cell death is more likely to be an explanation for the differences found in tumor size. The present study showed that tumors derived from PC-Babe-injected mice developed large, highly vascularized tissue. These tumors are characterized with a higher proliferating index as compared with the PC-JDP2-derived tumors, which may explain the differences observed in the tumor vascularization and thus are not necessarily a direct consequence of JDP2 expression. JDP2 was shown previously to serve as a co-activator of the progesterone receptor (11Wardell S.E. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Adelman J.S. Aronheim A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5451-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since the lack of detectable JDP2 protein correlates with loss of androgen-dependence, it may be possible that JDP2 cooperates with the androgen receptor in the initial stages of androgen-dependent prostate cancer, and either upon loss or upon part of the transition to androgen-independent stage, JDP2 expression is lost. Thus, it would be interesting to test the possible cooperation between the androgen receptor and JDP2. Previous work with dominant negative mutants of c-Jun, designated TAM67, also demonstrated the ability of this artificial reagent to inhibit AP-1-dependent breast cancer tumor growth (20Liu Y. Ludes-Meyers J. Zhang Y. Munoz-Medellin D. Kim H.T. Lu C. Ge G. Schiff R. Hilsenbeck S.G. Osborne C.K. Brown P.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7680-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism suggested for inhibition was through the inhibition of the major AP-1 component c-Jun and inhibition of transcription of Jun-dependent genes important for cell cycle progression, such as cyclin D1, and therefore, highlighting c-Jun importance in multiple malignant cell transformation. In this study, the ectopic expression of JDP2, an otherwise ubiquitously expressed protein, was shown to inhibit cell transformation. The results, on the one hand, establish the role of JDP2 as a tumor suppressor gene, and on the other hand, may provide a potential therapeutic tool for inhibition of cell transformation upon JDP2 overexpression. In addition, the mechanism of JDP2 inhibition of cell transformation is not solely dependent on inhibition of AP-1-dependent transcription but also can be explained in part by increasing the expression levels of JunB, JunD, and Fra2. JunB was shown to increase the expression of p16ink4a (21Passegue E. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), whereas JunD was shown to collaborate with the tumor suppressor protein, Menin (22Agarwal S.K. Guru S.C. Heppner C. Erdos M.R. Collins R.M. Park S.Y. Saggar S. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Collins F.S. Spiegel A.M. Marx S.J. Burns A.L. Cell. 1999; 96: 143-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), to inhibit cell growth. Interestingly, the shorter (34 kDa) JunB species found in PC-JDP2-derived tumor (Fig. 7A) is associated with quiescent postmitotic cell state (23Sheerin A. Thompson K.S. Goyns M.H. Cancer Lett. 2002; 177: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). PC3 cells are derived from bone metastatic lesions of a prostate cancer patient, in which the increased levels of JunD and Fra2 are correlated with post-proliferative osteoblasts (24Yeung F. Law W.K. Yeh C.H. Westendorf J.J. Zhang Y. Wang R. Kao C. Chung L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2468-2476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to uncover whether JDP2 directly regulates the JunB and JunD promoters or their higher expression represents indirect JDP2 effect. In addition, consistent with the ability of JDP2 to inhibit c-Jun expression in F9 cells (5Jin C. Li H. Murata T. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Chiu R. Yokoyama K.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4815-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we observed a strong decrease in c-Jun expression in PC-JDP2-derived tumor lysate. Previous study has shown that JDP2 represses p53 expression; nevertheless, PC3 cells are hemizygous for mutated p53 gene (25Carroll A.G. Voeller H.J. Sugars L. Gelmann E.P. Prostate. 1993; 23: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 expression in the PC3 cell lines and tumor-derived extracts could not be detected. In this study, we established the role of JDP2 in inhibition of cell transformation. Nevertheless, one cannot exclude the possibility that under certain genetic alterations, JDP2 cooperates in cell transformation. A case in point is the overexpression of JDP2 in the background of loss of function of p27kip (12Hwang H.C. Martins C.P. Bronkhorst Y. Randel E. Berns A. Fero M. Clurman B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11293-11298Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or yet to be discovered mutations. Indeed, we observed, although at low incidence, higher expression of JDP2 in tumor tissues as compared with normal tissues in the normal/tumor panel (Fig. 2); however, the fact that a combination of other genetic alterations might have occurred in these patients along with JDP2 overexpression should be further analyzed. In addition, in chicken embryo fibroblast, JDP2 overexpression resulted in partial cell transformation (13Blazek E. Wasmer S. Kruse U. Aronheim A. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2151-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It was already shown that cell transformation in chicken embryo fibroblast does not necessarily represent the oncogenic potential of a given protein. For example, whereas ectopic expression of c-Jun was found to transform chicken embryo fibroblast, it was not sufficient for transformation of rat embryo fibroblast cells (26Su Z. Shi Y. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3411-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that JunB transforms chicken embryo fibroblast and promotes growth in soft agar (27Castellazzi M. Spyrou G. La Vista N. Dangy J.P. Piu F. Yaniv M. Brun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, in mouse embryonic fibroblast, JunB overexpression results in premature senescence (21Passegue E. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Another possible explanation for the ability of JDP2 to partially transform chicken embryo fibroblast could be the lack of JunB in avian cells. In PC-JDP2-derived tumors, JunB was shown to be elevated and may explain in part JDP2 anti-proliferative action. It would be of great interest to generate animal models in which JDP2 expression is genetically manipulated toward gain/loss of function. These animal models would enable us to determine at which stage of tumorogensis JDP2 expression is required to rescue malignant transformation and examine the contribution of loss of JDP2 expression in multiple carcinogenesis models in vivo.

In contrast, Y14 and magoh, which remain stably associated with mRNA after export to the cytoplasm, join the EJC during or after completion of exon-exon ligation.

It has recently become apparent that pre-mRNA splicing serves not only to remove introns but also to enhance the utilization of the spliced mRNA in subsequent steps of the gene expression pathway (3Dreyfuss G.

The components of the EJC function in post-splicing events (for example, Aly/REF) enhance the export of mRNAs, likely by recruiting the mRNA export factor TAP (12Zhou Z. Luo M.J. Straesser K. Katahira J. Hurt E. Reed R. Nature. 2000; 407: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 18Rodrigues J.P. Rode M. Gatfield D. Blencowe B.J. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Y14, magoh, and RNPS1 can also interact with TAP (10Kataoka N. Diem M.D. Kim V.N. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6424-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1836-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), suggesting they may help recruit additional TAP molecules to mRNAs and play a role in mRNA transport. Components of the EJC also appear to function in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (20Culbertson M.R. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 21Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E.

NMD is a quality control process that surveys and selectively degrades mRNAs that contain premature termination codons, because the translation of such mRNAs may result in production of potentially harmful carboxyl-terminal-truncated proteins. Factors required for NMD have been previously isolated from various organisms and termed Upf1, -2, and -3. Among these factors, Upf3 has been shown to interact with Y14 and be a component of the exon-exon junction complex (16Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2001; 293: 1832-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that the EJC proteins have the capacity to communicate critical information on mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the translation-dependent process of NMD occurs (in addition, there may be nuclear NMD) (26Cheng J. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 1892-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 27Aoufouchi S. Yelamos J. Milstein C.

There is further supporting evidence for the role of the EJC in NMD. When tethered downstream of a legitimate stop codon, RNPS1, and to a lesser extent Y14, can elicit NMD (19Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1836-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). RNPS1 can also be co-immunoprecipitated with Upf proteins (19Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1836-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), suggesting that it can recruit Upf proteins onto mRNA. Another EJC protein is magoh, the human homologue of the Drosophila mago nashi protein. Magoh binds avidly and specifically to Y14. These two proteins remain stably associated with newly exported mRNAs in the cytoplasm in the same position near the exon-exon junction, whereas most of the EJC components rapidly dissociate during or immediately after mRNA export (7Kataoka N.

Translation of the mRNA is required for removal of Y14 and magoh (34Dostie J. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1060-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Both Y14 and magoh (also referred to as Tsunagi and Mago nashi in Drosophila, respectively) are essential for cell viability in Drosophila, and mutants of Y14 and mago nashi show mislocalization of oskar mRNA in Drosophila oocytes (35Hachet O. Ephrussi A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1666-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 36Mohr S.E. Dillon S.T. Boswell R.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2886-2899PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cytoplasmic remnants of the EJC, comprising at least Y14 and magoh, also have important roles in cytoplasmic events such as mRNA localization. Although the formation of the EJC is splicing-dependent, little is known about the process of assembly of the EJC. The splicing factor UAP56, a DEXD-box-type RNA helicase, has been shown to interact with Aly/REF; this interaction is evolutionarily conserved among Saccharomyces cerevisae, Drosophila, and human (37Gatfield D. Le Hir H. Schmitt C. Braun I.C. Kocher T. Wilm M. Izaurralde E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1716-1721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 38Jensen T.H. Boulay J. Rosbash M.

This provides an explanation for why Aly/REF is enriched in spliced mRNA. However, it is not known where and how the EJC is formed from its individual components during or after splicing. Here we show that EJC formation is an ordered stepwise process and that its known components can be separated into three groups based on when they begin to associate with the pre-mRNA/mRNA substrate. Aly/REF, RNPS1, and SRm160 make up the first, early group. These three proteins are found enriched on pre-mRNA prior to the first catalytic step of splicing and remain bound to the mRNA. Upf3b, on the other hand, mainly associates with the splicing intermediates 5′ exon and intron-lariat with 3′ exon, prior to exon ligation, and therefore forms a second group. Interestingly, Y14 and magoh, which persist on mRNAs in the cytoplasm after other EJC proteins have been removed, join the EJC at a later step of splicing after several of the other EJC proteins have already been added and form the third group. Plasmid Construction—Aly/REF, RNPS1, DEK, Srm160, and Y14 were PCR-amplified and cloned into FLAG-pcDNA3 using BamH1 and XhoI (16Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2001; 293: 1832-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). FLAG-magoh and FLAG-hUpf3b were described previously (10Kataoka N. Diem M.D. Kim V.N. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6424-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2001; 293: 1832-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cell culture was done as described previously (41Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Calphos™ mammalian transfection kit (Clontech) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Whole Cell Extract Preparation—24 h post-transfection, HEK293T cells were harvested and whole extracts were prepared. Briefly, the cells were washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) each time. The cells were scraped, resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the PBS was completely removed. The resulting pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer E (20 mm Hepes-KCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). 200 μl of buffer E was used per 10-cm plate. The resuspended cells were disrupted by sonication with an Ultrasonic processor Model VC130PB (Sonics & Materials Inc., Newtown, PA). The cells were sonicated at 30% continuous setting for 5 s three times with a 30-s incubation on ice between bursts and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was saved as whole cell extracts, which were quickly frozen in small aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described previously (41Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG tag polyclonal antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:500 dilution as the manufacturer recommends. In Vitro Splicing and Immunoprecipitation—The template plasmids for in vitro transcription were generous gifts from Dr. Christopher W. J. Smith (University of Cambridge). In vitro transcription and splicing were performed as described previously (42Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Briefly, a typical 40-μl splicing reaction contained 4 μl of 10×SP (42Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), 24 μl of HEK293T whole cell extract, and 32P-labeled transcript. Following a 3-h incubation at 30 °C, immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody M2 beads was carried out as described previously (10Kataoka N. Diem M.D. Kim V.N. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6424-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2001; 293: 1832-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To study the interaction of proteins with pre-mRNAs and splicing intermediates and assess their roles in splicing, we have previously described a system that allows for the rapid expression of proteins and preparation of active splicing extracts. To do so, we expressed tagged proteins by transfection in HEK293T cells, which allow efficient transient protein expression; we produced extracts from these cells and combined them with standard HeLa nuclear extracts for in vitro splicing. The tagged proteins could then be isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-tag antibodies, and the RNAs with which they associate could be identified (10Kataoka N. Diem M.D. Kim V.N. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6424-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2001; 293: 1832-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We have now improved and simplified this system further. Production of active HeLa nuclear extracts is time-consuming and labor intensive and involves multiple centrifugation and dialysis steps, resulting in batch-to-batch variation. To simplify this system and combine it with the high transfection efficiencies of HEK293T cells, we produced HEK293T whole cell extract, made by simply sonicating the cells in the splicing buffer followed by centrifugation and collection of the resulting supernatant for in vitro splicing. The HEK293T cells were first transfected with FLAG-tagged cDNA under the control of a mammalian promoter that allowed the use of anti-FLAG affinity beads for subsequent immunoprecipitations after the in vitro splicing reaction in the lysate of these cells. As shown in Fig. 1, HEK293T whole cell lysate maintains a splicing activity. The splicing efficiency of the whole cell lysates is almost similar with several different pre-mRNAs (data not shown). To further verify the validity of this system, antibodies against heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/2, Y14, and Aly/REF were used to immunoprecipitate 32P-labeled RNA from the splicing reaction. As reported previously, anti-heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/2 antibody preferentially immunoprecipitated pre-mRNA (Fig. 1, lane 2) and anti-Y14 antibody predominantly immunoprecipitated mRNA (Fig. 1, lane 3) (7Kataoka N. Yong J. Kim V.N. Velazquez F. Perkinson R.A. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), whereas anti-Aly/REF immunoprecipitated both species (Fig. 1, lane 4) (38Jensen T.H. Boulay J. Rosbash M. Libri D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1711-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, HEK293T whole cell lysates are active in splicing and give consistent results when compared with HeLa nuclear extracts. Furthermore, transfected FLAG-tagged proteins work efficiently at immunoprecipitation of in vitro spliced pre-mRNA (10Kataoka N. Diem M.D. Kim V.N. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6424-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2001; 293: 1832-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We therefore used whole cell lysates of HEK293T cells that were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged cDNAs for in vitro splicing and immunoprecipitation. This system allowed us to set up the assays using only anti-FLAG affinity beads; this avoided the need to produce the proteins separately, purify them, and obtain antibodies specific to each protein for immunoprecipitations. Moreover, the use of the same anti-FLAG antibodies for all the proteins studied allowed a better comparison of the differences between the various proteins. To study the association of the various EJC proteins with pre-mRNAs, splicing intermediates, and mRNAs, we produced whole cell lysates that express FLAG-tagged EJC components. The level of expression of each of the FLAG-tagged proteins was determined by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, all FLAG-tagged proteins were expressed as full-length and the expression level was comparable, except for magoh, which consistently gave a lower signal (10Kataoka N. Diem M.D. Kim V.N. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6424-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This may be the result of less efficient expression of magoh, but it is also possible that the lower signals are simply because of poor transfer or lower retention of magoh on the membrane because of this protein's small size. We also checked the efficiency of immunoprecipitation for each protein from splicing reaction to ensure that the epitope used for the immunoprecipitation (FLAG tag) is accessible in all of them. The results presented in Fig. 2B show that each protein was immunoprecipitated with very similar efficiency (10-15%). These results indicate that this system allows us to compare the association of these EJC proteins with RNA. The lysates were then used for in vitro splicing of a pre-mRNA construct, designated GC + DX, derived from α-tropomyosin gene pre-mRNA (43Liu Z.R. Laggerbauer B. Lührmann R. Smith C.W. RNA. 1997; 3: 1207-1219PubMed Google Scholar). We chose to study this pre-mRNA because of the availability of a derivative of this pre-mRNA that contains a stem-loop structure in the intron that blocks splicing between the first and second catalytic steps (see below). There was no detectable difference in splicing efficiency among the extracts produced from the cells transfected with the various constructs (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation following splicing was then carried out using anti-FLAG affinity beads. Aly/REF, RNPS1, and SRm160 efficiently co-immunoprecipitated pre-mRNA (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 3, and 5), whereas Y14 and magoh pulled down mainly mRNA (lanes 6 and 7). Interestingly, splicing intermediates such as the 5′ exon and the intron-lariat with 3′ exon were efficiently immunoprecipitated by Upf3b (lane 8). There was no detectable immunoprecipitation of RNA from either the DEK- or mock-transfected extracts (lanes 4 and 9). The observed differences in the intermediates that were immunoprecipitated from the various extracts suggest that the EJC is not pre-assembled and does not assemble on the mRNA all at once but rather that there is an order in which the EJC components assemble on spliced mRNA. For instance, because Upf3b associates with the 5′ exon and intron-lariat intermediates, this protein most likely interacts with the RNA substrate during or immediately after the first catalytic step of splicing, whereas Aly/REF, RNPS1, and SRm160 associate with pre-mRNA prior to the first catalytic step. Y14 and magoh, on the other hand, only significantly associate with the mRNA and therefore probably interact only at a late stage of splicing. To further investigate the stepwise assembly of the EJC we used HP1 pre-mRNA as the splicing substrate. HP1 pre-mRNA is derived from the GC + DX pre-mRNA, but it contains a stable stem-loop structure that blocks the second catalytic step of splicing and thus results in the accumulation of splicing intermediates (Fig. 3B, lane 10) (43Liu Z.R. Laggerbauer B. Lührmann R. Smith C.W. RNA. 1997; 3: 1207-1219PubMed Google Scholar). As before, the pre-mRNA substrate was used in an in vitro splicing reaction and interacting RNA intermediates were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG affinity beads and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Aly/REF, RNPS1, and SRm160 again predominantly immunoprecipitated pre-mRNA (Fig. 3B, lanes 11, 12, and 14). Upf3b, on the other hand, efficiently immunoprecipitates the splicing intermediates 5′ exon and intron-lariat with 3′ exon from the splicing reaction (Fig. 3B, lane 17). In contrast, Y14 and magoh showed no significant interaction with either the pre-mRNA or the splicing intermediates (Fig. 3B, lanes 15 and 16). No co-immunoprecipitation of RNA was observed for DEK- or mock-transfected lysates (Fig. 3B, lanes 13 and 18). Taken together, Aly/REF, RNPS1, and SRm160 associate with the pre-mRNA prior to or during spliceosome assembly, whereas Upf3b associates during or immediately after the first catalytic step. Y14 and magoh, however, are only enriched on spliced mRNA and thus associate during or after the second catalytic step. These findings indicate that EJC formation is a stepwise process and is splicing-dependent. Using a simplified whole cell lysate system for in vitro splicing in conjunction with transfection of tagged proteins as a way to obviate the need for separate production of proteins or the need for protein-specific antibodies, we investigated the assembly of the EJC. We expressed the EJC proteins individually as FLAG-tagged fusions from the corresponding cDNAs and identified the splicing precursors, intermediates, and products with which they associate by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies. This strategy also eliminated differences that may result from different efficiencies of the various antibodies against the individual EJC components and thus allowed for a better direct comparison among them. We tested the seven known components of the EJC and found they could be divided into three groups based on when in the course of the splicing reaction they become associated with the RNA. A schematic representation of these observations is provided in Fig. 4. Aly/REF, RNPS1, and SRm160 associate with pre-mRNAs before the first catalytic step and comprise the first group (Fig. 3). Aly/REF was shown to interact with the splicing factor UAP56, a DEXD-box helicase, and this interaction is conserved from human to yeast (37Gatfield D. Le Hir H. Schmitt C. Braun I.C. Kocher T. Wilm M. Izaurralde E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1716-1721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 38Jensen T.H. Boulay J. Rosbash M. Libri D. Curr.

UAP56 is an essential splicing factor that is required for stable association of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein with the branch point and for spliceosome assembly (44Fleckner J. Zhang M. Valcárcel J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 45Kistler A.L. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 46Libri D. Graziani N. Saguez C. Boulay J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 47Zhang M. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that UAP56 promotes the binding of Aly/REF to pre-mRNA during splicing at an early step, consistent with our observation that Aly/REF stably bound to pre-mRNA before the first catalytic reaction. RNPS1 also associates with pre-mRNA (13Mayeda A. Badolato J. Kobayashi R. Zhang M.Q. Gardiner E.M. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). SRm160 interacts with SR proteins, factors that have essential roles in splicing during early spliceosome assembly, and it cannot associate with pre-mRNA in the absence of SR proteins (14Blencowe B.J. Issner R. Nickerson J.A. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 996-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 48Eldridge A.G. Li Y. Sharp P.A. Blencowe B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that SR proteins recruit or stabilize the interaction of SRm160 with the pre-mRNA during this early stage. Upf3b, which associates with the splicing intermediates, comprises the second group in the EJC assembly pathway (Fig. 3). Upf3b is a nuclear protein that has a role in NMD (15Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 49Serin G. Gersappe A. Black J.D. Aronoff R. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and is a component of the EJC (16Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2001; 293: 1832-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Le Hir H. Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4987-4997Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Upf3b can interact with RNPS1 (19Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1836-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and it is therefore possible that RNPS1 facilitates the association of Upf3b with the spliceosome once it associates with the pre-mRNA. Y14 and magoh can be classified as the third group. These two proteins remain bound to the mRNA even after export (7Kataoka N. Yong J. Kim V.N. Velazquez F. Perkinson R.A. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Mol.

The association of Y14 and magoh with the mRNA at a late step of splicing may serve as a mark that splicing is complete (Fig. 3). Because ALY/REF, RNPS1, and Upf3 all have the capacity to interact with Y14 (10Kataoka N. Diem M.D. Kim V.N. Yong J. Dreyfuss G.

We note that we did not observe an association between DEK, another reported component of the EJC (8Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2778-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported on the EJC assembly in HeLa nuclear extract. They suggest that Aly/REF is bound to the pre-mRNA prior to spliceosome assembly but becomes enriched during splicing, whereas Y14, magoh, RNPS1, and SRm160 enter the spliceosome prior to exon ligation. Upf3b was not examined in this study, but the general conclusions are in partial agreement with our results, with some exceptions. First, we do not observe significant amounts of Y14 and magoh prior to exon ligation; second, we do detect RNPS1 and SRm160 interacting strongly with the pre-mRNA prior to intron-lariat and 5′ exon formation. Upf3b is the only protein we see becoming enriched on the 5′ exon and intron-lariat. It is possible that some of the differences are because of differences in the experimental approaches and perhaps also to transcript-specific differences. In either case, both sets of data point to EJC formation being a stepwise process that is in concert with splicing. How the multiple proteins of the EJC all bind to a small region of the RNA and how this occurs specifically at ∼-20 nucleotides upstream of the exon-exon junction in a position-specific but sequence-independent manner remains to be clarified. Finally, the simple whole cell lysate system we described here should facilitate rapid and small-scale preparation of active splicing lysates from many different cell types and tissues. We thank Drs.

Reconstitution of the 4Fe-4S cluster of SNR did not affect the reductive capacity for PAPS or APS.

The interconversion of the clusters is thought to serve as oxygen-sensitive switch that suppresses SO3 formation under aerobiosis. Plants, fungi, and many bacteria reduce inorganic sulfate to sulfide to cover their need for the element sulfur. This assimilatory type of sulfate reduction has two reductive steps in which sulfate is reduced to sulfite and sulfite is reduced further to sulfide. The reduction of sulfate to sulfite requires two electrons at a redox potential of -517 mV, which is considered too high for physiological electron carriers. Chemical activation of the sulfate by forming a mixed anhydride between phosphoric and sulfuric acid as in adenylyl sulfate (APS) 1The abbreviations used are: APS, adenylylsulfate; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; Grx, glutaredoxin; IMPACT, intein-mediated purification with an affinity chitin binding tag; IscA and IscS, iron-sulfur cluster (assembling) proteins; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate; SNR, sulfonucleotide reductase; Trx, thioredoxin; DTT, dithiothreitol; Bs, B. subtilis. 1The abbreviations used are: APS, adenylylsulfate; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; Grx, glutaredoxin; IMPACT, intein-mediated purification with an affinity chitin binding tag; IscA and IscS, iron-sulfur cluster (assembling) proteins; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate; SNR, sulfonucleotide reductase; Trx, thioredoxin; DTT, dithiothreitol; Bs, B. subtilis. or 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (PAPS) lowers the potential to mE0 = -60 mV, which is covered by thiols or pyrimidine nucleotides. The reduction is catalyzed by APS- and PAPS reductases. These proteins have a similar core protein of ∼30 kDa in which the reactive center is located in a conserved ECG(L/I)H motif. Small redox proteins like thioredoxin (Trx) and glutaredoxin (Grx) are the physiological reductants for this group of reductases, whereas the APS reductases from higher plants also use monothiols like glutathione. Plant APS reductases that can use glutathione are larger than the Trx/Grx-dependent reductases because of an extension at their C terminus of ∼16 kDa. This extension with its YAPWCXXC motif shows structural and functional similarities to thioredoxins or glutaredoxins (1Setya A. Murillo M. Leustek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The core protein of the plant APS reductase and many of the PAPS reductase homologues found in different bacteria of the phytosphere contain a second CXXC and a Cys-Cys double cysteine motif. APS reductases of the plant type differ from PAPS reductases of the Trx-Grx type in that they contain a 4Fe-4S group (4Suter M. von Ballmoos P. Kopriva S. Op den Camp R. Schaller J. Kuhlemeier C.

In view of the structural similarity between plant APS reductase and the reductases from Rhizobia (6Abola A.P. Willits M.G. Wang R.C. Long S.R. J.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it appeared plausible to suggest that these bacteria also reduce APS instead of PAPS. Williams et al. (8Williams S.J.

They concluded that the Bacillus gene product was an APS-specific sulfonucleotide reductase because Bacillus subtilis cysH1 complemented an APS kinase-deficient strain of Escherichia coli (JM81A cysC). Based on a comparison of the primary structure of sulfonucleotide reductases from higher plants and bacteria, Kopriva et al. (9Kopriva S. Büchert T. Fritz G. Suter M. Benda R. Schünemann V.

In this study, we analyzed B. subtilis sulfonucleotide reductase (SNR), the cysH gene product as model enzyme to explore the substrate specificity, and the reaction kinetics under steady state conditions using a recombinant sulfonucleotide reductase. The enzyme was isolated and analyzed as a tag-free protein obtained by using the intein-catalyzed self-cleavage expression system. Data from ultraviolet-visible absorption, EPR, and Mössbauer spectroscopy were collected to elucidate the nature and function of the prosthetic group. The Mössbauer data presented here show that the enzyme from B. subtilis is a 4Fe-4S protein. The function of the 4Fe-4S group in the reduction of APS and PAPS was investigated using Bs apoprotein in which the iron-sulfur group was first removed by treatment with an oxidant in combination with a chelator and then reassembled using the iron-sulfur cluster-synthesizing proteins IscA1 and IscS. The effect of this treatment on substrate specificity for APS or PAPS was tested with either substrate in combination with recombinant thioredoxin or glutaredoxin from E. coli as reductants.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacteria Strains, Plasmids, and Oligonucleotides—E. coli BL21(DE3) used for expression was obtained from Novagen (Bad Soden), and plasmid pTYB12 was from New England Biolabs. Plasmid pBscysH is a derivate of pTYB12 harboring a 732-base pair cysH PCR fragment from B. subtilis. The cysH fragment was amplified from a pET16bcysH subclone 2A. Prior, unpublished data. of pBS170 (10Mansilla M.C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 976-981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using NdeI, 5′-GAGAGACATATGTTAACGTATGATAATTGGGAAGAACC-3′, and SmaI, 5′-CTCTCTCCCGGGTTCATGCAGTCCCGATTCTGTTTTCGC-3′, primers. NdeI/SmaI restriction sites (underlined) were introduced to enable in-frame cloning in pTYB12. Correct insertion and error-free amplification of the BscysH1 gene cloned in pTYB was verified by DNA sequencing.Growth of Bacteria—Transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were grown in mineral medium (11Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a constant pH of 7.6 in a chemostat. The medium was supplemented with 2% glycerol, 0.5% glucose, 1% mineral Pfennig-medium SL4 (12AnonymousCatalogue of Strains: Media. Deutsche Sammlung Mikroorganismen, DSM Göttingen, Germany1989: 280Google Scholar), 20 μm thiamin, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The fermenter (Meredos GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) was inoculated with a mid-log phase culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) at a concentration of 2% (v/v) harboring plasmid pTYB12BscysH. Cells were grown under vigorous aeration at 35 °C. When the cells had reached a density of A600 0.7–0.8, adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm induced 0.8 expression of cysH. The temperature was reduced to 12 °C, and the cells were grown for 16 h until harvest by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min (yield 3–3.5 × g × liter-1). They were washed once in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and kept frozen at -28 °C until use.Preparation of SNR—Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES buffer/NaCl to give 0.1 g of wet weight/ml. The cells were disrupted by two consecutive passages through a French press (Ribi Cell Fractionator) applying 14.2 megapascals at 5–10 °C. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 45 min and loaded to a column (24-mm-inner diameter × 35 mm) packed with chitin beads (IMPACT-CN system, New England Biolabs). Self-cleavage of the chitin affinity intein tag was induced by on-column reaction of the bound protein with 50 mm cysteamine at 12 °C for 48 h. Tag-free protein was eluted with HEPES buffer/NaCl. The protein was concentrated by pressure dialysis under N2 in an Amicon-type of a concentrator using a YM3 membrane. The average yield per liter of broth was 5 mg of SNR.Protein intended for Mössbauer spectra was isolated from bacteria grown under virtually identical conditions in a medium containing 57Fe(NH4)2SO4 as the only source of iron. The protein (in HEPES buffer/NaCl) was purified as described above and enriched by ultrafiltration and pressure dialysis to give a final concentration of approximately 0.7 mm SNR.SNR Assay, Preparation of 35S-labeled Substrates, and Auxiliary Enzymes—Initial rates of SNR were measured as the formation of [35S]sulfite from either [35S]APS or [35S]PAPS as described previously (13Schwenn J.D. Schriek U. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and modified (for details see Ref. 14Lillig C.H. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Aslund F. Ritz D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7695-7698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The assay for kinetic constants contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 μg of SNR, 10 mm dithiothreitol (or 10 mm reduced glutathione), thioredoxin 1 varied from 1.3 to 100 μm (or glutaredoxin 1 varied from 1.3 to 80 μm), [35S]APS (1.3–60 μm) (or [35S]PAPS (1.3–50 μm)), and 10 mm Na2SO3. [35S]PAPS was prepared as described previously (15Schriek U. Schwenn J.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using recombinant APS kinase (16Lillig C.H. Schiffmann S. Berndt C. Berken A. Tischka R. Schwenn J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). [35S]APS was made from PAPS by nuclease treatment and purified by chromatography on a Fractogel/DEAE 650 (s) ion-exchanger.Recombinant IscS and IscA1 gene products from Synechocystis PCC 6803 were prepared as described previously (17Wollenberg M. Berndt C. Bill E. Schwenn J.D. Seidler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1662-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). His-tagged Trx1 and Grx1 were expressed as described in Ref. 14Lillig C.H.

Concentrations of Trx1 and Grx1 were determined using molar absorption coefficients at 280 nm (15.222 m-1 cm-1 and 10.810 m-1 cm-1), whereas soluble protein was routinely measured as Coomassie Brilliant Blue R dye complex (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as reference. The purity was examined by SDS-PAGE replacing DTT for β-mercaptoethanol.Determination of Acid-labile Sulfide, Iron, and UV-visible Spectra— Hydrogen sulfide was measured colorimetrically as methylene-blue complex at 650 nm adapting the method of Beinert (19Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) as modified previously (20Broderick J.B. Henshaw T.F. Cheek J. Wojtuszewski K. Smith S.R. Trojan M.R. McGhan R.M. Kopf A. Kibbey M. Broderick W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).The content of iron in Bs SNR was determined by atom absorption spectroscopy in a Zeiss AAS3 spectrometer using a solution of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 in HEPES buffer/NaCl as reference. Column effluents were measured by the rapid colorimetric micromethod of Fish (21Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar).Optical spectra during SNR reconstitution were recorded on a Kontron Uvikon 810 two-beam spectrophotometer under anaerobic conditions using a slit width of 2 nm and 1-cm light path. The reference cuvette contained the reaction mixture without SNR. Spectra under aerobic condition were recorded using a diode array spectrophotometer (Beckmann DU 7400).Reconstitution of Bs SNR—The Fe-S cluster of Bs SNR was completely removed by treatment with ferricyanide and extraction of the metal with EDTA (22Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8194-8198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a typical set up, 15 μm SNR in 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, were incubated on ice with 0.3 mm K3Fe(CN)6 and 0.75 mm EDTA for 10 min (ratio of enzyme, EDTA:K3Fe(CN), approximately 1:50:20). The apoprotein was then rapidly separated from ionic contaminants by gel filtration on PD10 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with HEPES buffer. For reassembly of the 4Fe-4S cluster, approximately 200 pmol of SNR were incubated with 800 pmol of IscA1 precharged by IscS with 2Fe-2S cluster equivalents in HEPES buffer and DTT as described previously (17Wollenberg M. Berndt C. Bill E. Schwenn J.D. Seidler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1662-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Uncharged IscA1 or Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and Na2S were used as control. The progress of reassembly of the 4Fe-4S cluster was tested measuring SNR activity with samples of 0.3 μg. IscA1 or IscS did not exhibit any SNR activity.The transition from 4Fe-4S to 2Fe-2S cluster was analyzed following the changes in activity and spectra of 20 μm SNR incubated in HEPES buffer with 0.2 μm IscA1, 0.2 μm IscS, 80 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 200 μm cysteine, 5 mm DTT, and 10 μm pyridoxal phosphate. The kinetics of the 4Fe-4S cluster decomposition were measured at 35 °C under aerobic conditions following the changes in activity and spectra of 30 μm SNR.Mössbauer and EPR Spectra—Mössbauer data were recorded with a spectrometer of the alternating constant acceleration type. The minimum experimental line width was 0.24 mm s-1 (full width at half-height). The sample temperature was maintained constant either in an Oxford Instruments Variox or an Oxford Instruments Mössbauer Spectromag cryostat. Isomer shifts are quoted relative to iron metal at 300 K.EPR Spectra—X-band EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer equipped with a helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments ESR 910), an NMR gaussmeter, and a Hewlett-Packard frequency counter.RESULTSB. subtilis is the best characterized member of the Gram-positive bacteria. The wealth of available information regarding this bacterium has made B. subtilis the paradigm for analysis of the physiology of Gram-positive bacteria, of bacterial differentiation, and of useful application of bacterial products. However, the mechanism of sulfate reduction and cysteine biosynthesis remains poorly understood (23Grundy F.J. Henkin T. Sonenshine A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Relatives: From Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 245-254Google Scholar). B. subtilis PAPS reductase was originally discovered in a Tn917-mutagenized strain of BD170 screened for lipoic acid auxotrophy. Nutritional and complementational analysis of the transposon-treated strain indicated that the resultant auxotrophs were impaired for cysteine biosynthesis. Restoration to prototrophy of an E. coli cysH-deficient strain showed that the DNA region affected by insertional mutagenesis represented an ortholog of E. coli cysH (10Mansilla M.C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 976-981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We subcloned cysH from B. subtilis in the vector/host system required for the intein-mediated purification with a chitin binding affinity tag. Because of its inducible self-cleavage activity, this expression system produces a gene product without affinity tag in a single chromatographic step. Yet, the main reason for using the intein system was because recombinant APS and PAPS reductases with a polyhistidine tag were observed to bind unspecifically divalent metal ions. Recombinant Bs SNR obtained with the intein expression system was homogeneous and migrated to a position corresponding to 29 kDa when examined by SDS-PAGE. This size is in good agreement with the mass predicted from the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1, Mr = 26.974).Fe-S Cluster Sensitivity Toward Oxygen—The cysH gene product was eluted from the affinity matrix as brownish protein. The color faded rapidly under low ionic strength (e.g. gel filtration) and under aerobic conditions. In the early stages of protein purification, we observed that SNR recovered from column effluents had lost its activity together with most of its iron and the brownish color. As dilution and aerobic conditions appeared to induce de-coloration and loss of enzymatic activity, the purified protein intended for kinetic analysis was concentrated by pressure dialysis under nitrogen immediately after elution from the affinity column and kept in the highly concentrated form in 50% glycerol until use.UV-visible absorption spectroscopy showed in addition to the absorption maximum for polypeptides at 280 nm a broad absorption band between 350 and 500 nm with a shoulder at around 410 nm. The brownish color faded rapidly upon exposure to air. Difference spectra of un-oxidized versus oxidized protein showed that the bleaching at 410 nm was accompanied by appearance of a new maximum at 468 nm (Fig. 2). This transition very strongly resembled the oxygen-induced conversion of the 4Fe-4S cluster of fumarate nitrate reduction protein reported by Koroshilova et al. (24Khoroshilova N. Popescu C. Münck E. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6087-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The absorption spectra obtained from native (and from reconstituted protein) were taken as evidence that the enzyme contains an iron-sulfur cluster. The occurrence of a Fe-S center was not unexpected because the primary structure of the homologous plant-type APS reductase was already described to contain a 4Fe-4S cluster (5Kopriva S. Büchert T. Fritz G. Suter M. Weber M. Benda R. Schaller J. Feller U. Schürmann P. Schünemann V. Trautwein A.X. Kroneck P.M.H. Brunold C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42881-42886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The plant-type APS reductase is 33% identical with a similarity of the core protein of approximately 53% also containing the typical SIGCAPC and Cys-Cys motifs in addition to the ECGL-catalytic center cysteine. To gain information regarding the atomic composition of an iron-sulfur cluster in Bs SNR, the content of iron was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy, whereas the content of acid-labile sulfur was determined colorimetrically (19Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 20Broderick J.B. Henshaw T.F. Cheek J. Wojtuszewski K. Smith S.R. Trojan M.R. McGhan R.M. Kopf A. Kibbey M. Broderick W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). When purified Bs SNR was tested, 3.9 ± 0.03 equivalents of Fe and 4.8 ± 0.5 equivalents of sulfur as acid-labile sulfide were obtained per monomer of SNR (concentration of 0.21 mm per assay, three independent determinations).

The spectrum recorded at 80 K is depicted in Fig. 3A. It shows an asymmetric doublet that could be deconvoluted in two independent symmetric quadrupole doublets with Lorentzian line shapes and isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings as follows: δ = 0.44 mm s-1, ΔEQ = 1.07 mm s-1 (subspectrum I, Γfwhm = 0.33 mm s-1, 87% abundance) and δ = 0.32 mm s-1, ΔEQ = 0.44 mm s-1 (subspectrum II, Γfwhm = 0.30 mm s-1, 13% relative abundance).Fig. 3Mössbauer spectrum of B. subtilis sulfonucleotide reductase.A, spectrum of Bacillus subtilis SNR (0.7 mm) taken at 80 K from the tag-free protein as isolated is shown. SNR protein was not treated for Fe-S cluster reconstitution as in Fig. 5. The solid lines are fits with Lorentzian doublets. Parameter for subspectrum I and subspectrum II are as given in the text. Spectrum I is taken as a clear indication of a 4Fe-4S cluster in B. subtilis SNR, whereas spectrum II indicates either the presence of [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters or traces of unspecifically bound iron oxide. B, spectrum of B. subtilis SNR (0.3 mm) taken at 80 K from the tag-free protein exposed to air for 120 min at 35 °C. The solid lines are fits with Lorentzian doublets. Parameter for subspectra I, II, and III are as given in the text. Subspectra I and II represent the same species as in Fig. 3A, and subspectrum III accounts for FeIII in oxygen or nitrogen coordination.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Mössbauer parameters of the major “subspectrum I” are typical for [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters with an average iron oxidation state Fe2.5 that arises from valence delocalization of formally two Fe(II) and two Fe(III) (25Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Particularly, the isomer shift, which is a measure of the charge density at the iron nucleus site, is very close to the average limiting values found for typical tetrahedral Fe(III)S4 moieties found in oxidized [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters (δ = 0.27mm s-1) and the valence localized Fe(II)S4 site of the reduced [2Fe-2S]+ clusters (δ = 0.64 mm s-1) as expected for oxidized [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. The experimental spectrum of SNR shown in Fig. 3A does not show indication of magnetic broadening, which is in accord with the S = 0 ground state of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster.The low isomer shift and quadrupole splitting of “subspectrum II” resemble the values of iron(III) as it appears in [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters. Although the archetypical [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters in plant type ferredoxins (with all-cysteine coordination) show somewhat lower isomer shifts (0.27 mm s-1), the value for subspectrum II in the SNR sample matches that of the His2-Cys2-coordinated ferric ions in Rieske-type [2Fe-2S]2+ centers (δ = 0. 32 mm s-1, ΔEQ = 0.91 mm s-1 (26Fee J.A. Findling K.L. Yoshida T. Hille R. Tarr G.E. Hearshen D.O. Dunham W.R. Day P. Kent T.A. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 124-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Therefore, it is tempting to assign subspectrum II to an oxidized [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster, which are probably Cys2-Xaa2-coordinated units, because they would be formed by conversion of [4Fe-4S]2+ centers in Cys4 coordination.Alternatively, however, we cannot readily exclude an interpretation of subspectrum II as a contribution from iron-hydroxide contaminations (e.g. γ-FeOOH, which would have had δ = 0.30 mm s-1, ΔEQ = 0.55 mm s-1 (at 291 K)). It might be not unusual to find precipitations of iron (oxi)hydroxides attached to the protein. Small particles sizes of such oxidic contaminations would show superparamagnetic behavior with fast spin relaxation, which leads to apparently pure quadrupole spectra with completely collapsed magnetic hyperfine splitting. Such superparamagnetic contaminations can be virtually EPR-silent.Bs SNR similar to the plant APS reductase is EPR-silent (e.g. SNR spectra measured at 20, 10, and 4.2 K). Reduction by dithionite (S2O42-) or by the physiological reductant thioredoxin (plus DTT) failed to produce a signal that would indicate a reduced [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster. Quite similarly, oxidation by PAPS of a Trx-reduced SNR did not induce new EPR signals. Purified SNR, however, displayed a very weak FeIII signal (at g = 4.267). This high spin FeIII signal is believed to represent an artifact of the enzyme preparation. It is possibly related to the ferric iron contamination observed in the Mössbauer spectrum. In this respect, its noteworthy that E. coli PAPS reductase, which lacks a CXXC and Cys-Cys motif, does not bind extra iron FeIII and lacks this g signal.Decomposition and Reassembly of the Fe-S Clusters—Enzymatic activity in Bs SNR was correlated with the presence of a 4Fe-4S cluster. Destruction of this group affected the reduction of APS and PAPS alike (Fig. 5). Half-life of the enzyme under air in the Tris-buffered assay system was τ/2 = 12 min with glycine betaine at 2.5 m as the compatible solute lifetime was increased slightly to τ/2 = 22 min. When Bs SNR inactivation was monitored by absorbance spectroscopy, an intermediate between 4Fe-4S and fully decomposed cluster was observed, which displayed spectral properties of a 2Fe-2S cluster (ϵmax = 468 nm) (Fig. 4). Mössbauer spectra taken from this nearly fully decomposed form support the view that the 4Fe-4S cluster may have decomposed into a 2Fe-2S cluster before complete degradation. The 80-K Mössbauer spectrum of the oxidatively degraded SNR sample is an asymmetric pattern that could be deconvoluted in three symmetric quadrupole doublets as shown in Fig. 3B. Quadrupole splittings and isomer shifts of subspectra I and II were constrained to the values found in the native sample (as shown in Fig. 3A). Under this condition, a third subspectrum (subspectrum III) is found with δ = 0.50 mm s-1, ΔEQ = 0.65 mm s-1, and 72% relative abundance. The values are typical of iron(III) in oxygen or"
https://openalex.org/W2000895856,"Aggregation of the neurotoxic amyloid β peptide 1-42 (Aβ-(1-42)) in the brain is considered to be an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Par-4 (prostate apoptosis response-4) is a leucine zipper protein that is pro-apoptotic and associated with neuronal degeneration in AD. Overexpression of Par-4 significantly increased production of Aβ-(1-42) after initiation of apoptotic cascades, indicating factors regulating apoptotic pathways may also affect processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). AATF (apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor) was recently identified as an interaction partner of DAP-like kinase (Dlk), a member of the DAP (death-associated protein) kinase family. AATF antagonizes apoptosis induced by Par-4, suggesting that AATF might directly or indirectly participate in regulation of Par-4 activity. We now report that AATF colocalizes with Par-4 in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, and it interacts directly and selectively with Par-4 via the leucine zipper domain in neural cells. Par-4 induced an aberrant production and secretion of Aβ in neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells after apoptotic cascades are initiated. Co-expression of AATF completely blocked aberrant production and secretion of Aβ-(1-42) induced by Par-4, and AATF/Par-4 complex formation was essential for the inhibitory effect of AATF on aberrant Aβ secretion. These results indicate that AATF is an endogenous antagonist of Par-4 activity and an effective inhibitor of aberrant Aβ production and secretion under apoptotic conditions.

We now report that AATF interacts directly with Par-4 via the leucine zipper domain, and blocks Par-4 mediated aberrant production of Aβ-(1-42) in IMR-32 cells. Our data suggest that AATF may function as an endogenous inhibitor of Par-4 activity in APP processing. Selective enhancement of AATF expression in neuronal cells may therefore provide a potential therapeutic approach for aberrant production of Aβ-(1-42) in AD. Hippocampal Neuronal Cultures—Dissociated hippocampal cell cultures were prepared from postnatal day 1 mouse pups using methods similar to those described previously (47Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi were removed and incubated for 15 min in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hank's balanced saline solution (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.2% papain. Cells were dissociated by trituration and plated into polyethyleneimine-coated plastic or glass-bottom culture dishes containing minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). Following cell attachment (3-6-h post-plating), the culture medium was replaced with Neurobasal Medium with B27 supplements (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). Experiments were performed in 7-day-old cultures. Generation and Characterization of IMR-32 Cell Lines and Trophic Factor Withdrawal—Methods used in transfection experiments and induction of apoptosis by trophic factor withdrawal were described in our previous studies (40Guo Q.

A. 1999; 96: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In brief, human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells (ATCC) were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. A full-length Par-4 cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pRc/CMV, yielding a recombinant construct pCMV-Par-4, which encodes a 1.2-kb RNA species and a full-length 38kD Par-4 protein. A cDNA fragment containing Par-4 lacking the leucine zipper domain (Par-4ΔLeu.zip) was similarly subcloned into pRc/CMV expression vector, yielding a recombinant construct pCMV-Par4ΔLeuzip that encodes an 862-bp RNA species and an ∼30-kDa protein. A cDNA fragment containing full-length wild-type AATF and cDNAs containing various deletion mutants of AATF (see Ref. 50Page G. Lodige I. Kogel D. Scheidtmann K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), including AATF 390 (deletion of the C terminus NLS2), AATF 279 (deletion of the C terminus NLS2 and NSL1), AATF 179 (deletion of the C terminus NLS2, NSL1 and the putative leucine zipper domain), were subcloned into the pREP4 expression vector (Invitrogen), yielding recombinant constructs pREP4-AATF, pREP4-AATF390, pREP4-AATF279, and pREP4-AATF179. Human IMR-32 cell lines stably expressing Par-4 or Par4ΔLeuzip were established by transfection using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Inc.) with pCMV-Par-4 or pCMV-Par4ΔLeuzip. Transfected cells were selected with G418 (400 μg/ml) for 4 weeks, and surviving clones were selected. IMR-32 cells expressing AATF, AATF 390, AATF 279, and AATF 179 were similarly established except that the transfected cells were selected with hygromycin (400 μg/ml). Additional double-transfected IMR-32 cell lines were generated where two proteins (Par-4/AATF, Par4ΔLeuzip/AATF, Par-4/AATF390, Par-4/AATF279, or Par-4/AATF179) were co-expressed. For control purposes, parallel cultures of IMR-32 cells were stably transfected with pRc/CMV and pREP4 vectors alone. After the cells became confluent in the culture flasks, the culture medium were replaced with fresh media and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C to condition the medium for Aβ measurement. Trophic factor withdrawal was initiated by washing cultures four times with Locke's buffer (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) with subsequent incubation in 1 ml of Locke's buffer. Generation of AATF Antibody, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Levels of expression of Par-4 and AATF in hippocampal neurons were determined by Western blot analysis as described (46Guo Q. Fu W. Xie J. Luo H. Sells S.F. Geddes J.W. Bondada V. Rangnekar V.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 47Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A suitable peptide sequence (LDTDKRYSGKTTSRKAWKE, corresponding to rat AATF terminus amino acids 64-82) from AATF was chosen based on its antigenicity and other considerations. The BLAST program was used to compare the peptide sequence against known sequences in the major databases to avoid similarity and cross-reactivity with other related and unrelated proteins. The peptide was conjugated to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and used to immunize rabbits to generate AATF antisera (Sigma-Genosys, The Woodlands, TX) according to standard protocols. Crude antisera were affinity-purified further by adsorption of antibodies to the peptide that had been immobilized to Sepharose. Purified antibodies were eluted with ImmunoPure Gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer. The antibody was finally dialyzed, concentrated, and used at a dilution of 1:100 in Western blots. The specificity of the AATF antisera was analyzed by passing it down affinity columns containing the immobilized peptide and analyzing both the unbound fractions and eluted fractions in Western blots. We have found that the antibody recognizes rat, mouse and human AATF on Western blots. It revealed a strong band at about 70 kDa in whole cell protein extracts from both human IMR-32 cells and mouse primary neurons. The antibody recognizes AATF390, AATF 279, and AATF 179 as well as full-length AATF. The Par-4 antibody is a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against full-length rat Par-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). This antibody reacts with Par-4 of mouse, rat, and human origin, and recognizes both full-length Par-4 as well as the deletion mutant of Par-4 (Par-4ΔLeu.zip) that lacks the leucine zipper domain. In addition, the antibody recognizes both human and rodent Par-4 proteins at about 38 kDa. For immunoprecipitation, aliquots of cell lysates containing 200 μg of protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with appropriate dilutions of mouse anti-Par-4 or rabbit anti-AATF antibodies in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6). Protein A-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences, 30 μl/sample) was then added to the extracts for collection of the immunocomplexes, which was then washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, and solubilized by heating in Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 4 min. The solubilized proteins were separated by electro-phoresis on a 4-12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. For Western blot analysis, the nitrocellulose sheet was blocked with 5% milk followed by a 1-h incubation in the presence of primary anti-AATF or anti-Par4 antibody. The membrane was further processed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and immunoblotted proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To examine if AATF or Par-4 interacts with c-Jun, a leucine zipper containing transcription factor of about 39 kDa, a mouse monoclonal anti-c-Jun antibody (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) was used in the immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis. Equal loading was verified by probing the blots with the anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma). Western blot images were acquired and quantified using Kodak Image Station 2000R and Kodak Digital Science 1D 3.6. software. Immunocytochemistry by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—The cultured cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and membranes were permeabilized by incubation in 0.2% Triton-X100 in PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h in blocking serum (5% normal goat serum in PBS). Cells were then exposed to primary antibodies (1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-AATF polyclonal antibody and 1:100 mouse anti-Par-4 monoclonal antibody) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1 h with a mixture of Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit and fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images of Par-4 and/or AATF immunofluorescence were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (dual wave-length scan) with a ×60 oil immersion objective. All images were acquired using the same laser intensity and photodector gain, to allow quantitative comparisons of relative levels of fluorescence in the cells. The average pixel intensity per cell and sites of colocalization of immunoreactivities were determined using the Fluoview 2.0 software. Preparation of Whole Cell, Cytosolic, Membrane, and Nuclear Extracts—After washing 3 times with cold PBS, whole cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer as described in our previous studies (37Guo Q. Xie J. Chang X. Zhang X. Du H. Brain Res. 2001; 903: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 46Guo Q. Fu W. Xie J. Luo H. Sells S.F. Geddes J.W. Bondada V. Rangnekar V.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Nuclear, cytosolic and membrane fractions from IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells were isolated as described previously (59Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with cold PBS and homogenized in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer in cold lysis buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm bestatin, and 1 μm E64. 0.5 ml of the cell lysate was then layered onto a solution of 1.1 m sucrose in lysis buffer (0.5 ml) and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from this step contains cytosolic as well as membrane fractions, while the pellet contains nuclear extract. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant and pellet were cytosolic and membrane fractions, respectively. The nuclear pellet was washed by resuspension in 1 ml of 1.1 m sucrose in lysis buffer and recentrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The identity of these fractions has been confirmed previously by immunoblotting studies using various specific organelle markers (59Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Quantification of Extracellular and Intracellular Levels of Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) by Sandwich ELISAs—Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) levels in the conditioned culture media were measured using a fluorescence-based sandwich ELISA described in detail in our previous studies (40Guo Q. Xie J. Chang X. Du H. J..Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16040-16044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The C-terminal-specific sandwich ELISAs use a monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal region of human Aβ and two other antibodies specific for Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) (see Ref. 40Guo Q.

To investigate the molecular mechanism of protein sorting into COPII vesicles, we have developed an in vitro budding reaction comprising purified coat proteins and cargo reconstituted proteolipsomes. Emp47p, a type-I membrane protein, is specifically required for the transport of an integral membrane protein, Emp46p, from the ER. Recombinant Emp46/47p proteins and the ER resident protein Ufe1p were reconstituted into liposomes whose composition resembles yeast ER membranes. When the proteoliposomes were mixed with COPII proteins and GMP-PNP, Emp46/47p, but not Ufe1p, were concentrated into COPII vesicles. We also show here that reconstituted Emp47p accelerates the GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p as stimulated by its GTPase-activating protein, Sec23/24p, both of which are components of the COPII coat. Furthermore, this GTP hydrolysis decreases the error of cargo sorting. We suggest that GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p promotes exclusion of improper proteins from COPII vesicles.

In eukaryotic cells, intracellular protein transport between the organelles of the secretory pathway is mediated by vesicular carriers that are released from a donor organelle and fuse with an appropriate acceptor organelle. The starting point of the secretory route is the ER. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; COPII, coat protein complex II; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; GMP-PNP, guanyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate; NBD, 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)); MBP, maltose-binding protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). Transport of newly synthesized secretory proteins from the ER are sorted from ER-resident proteins and packaged into COPII-coated vesicles (1.Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). COPII coat consists of the small GTPase Sar1p (2.Nakano A. Muramatsu M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), the Sec23/24p complex, and the Sec13/31p complex that sequentially bind on the ER membrane (3.Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Budding from the ER involves activation of Sar1p-GDP to Sar1p-GTP by the ER-resident protein Sec12p, a Sar1p-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (4.Nakano A. Brada D. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5.Barlowe C. Schekman R. Nature. 1993; 365: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Sar1p-GTP bound to the ER membrane promotes Sec23/24p and Sec13/31p assembly, which drives vesicle budding (6.Springer S. Spang A. Schekman R. Cell. 1999; 97: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Reconstitution experiments demonstrate that this minimal set of COPII proteins is sufficient to form COPII vesicles from synthetic liposomes (7.Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that certain cargo possesses a binding affinity for COPII subunits, resulting selective packaging into COPII vesicles (8.Mossessova E. Bickford L.C. Goldberg J. Cell. 2003; 114: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 9.Miller E.A. Beilharz T.H. Malkus P.N. Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Cell. 2003; 114: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In this process, the pre-budding complex consisting of Sar1p-GTP and Sec23/24p bound to cargo is formed on the ER membrane (10.Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), (11.Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This pre-budding complex is then gathered by the Sec13/31p complex to form COPII vesicles. Conversely, the Sec23p subunit stimulates the GTP hydrolysis of Sar1p (12.Yoshihisa T. Barlowe C. Schekman R. Science. 1993; 259: 1466-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), which reverses the coat assembly process. Thus, the Sar1p GTPase cycle is thought to regulate both coat assembly and cargo sorting. To study precise molecular mechanisms of cargo sorting into COPII vesicles, it is important to examine GTP hydrolysis of Sar1p during coat assembly and cargo sorting. However, such studies have so far been difficult with in vitro budding assays using the fractionated organelle. In this report, we have overcome this and developed a new in vitro budding assay comprising purified coat proteins and cargo-reconstituted proteoliposomes. Our evidence supports the view that Sar1p serves directly in the cargo selection process. Plasmids—To construct pKSE131, pKSE132, and pKSE133 carrying the Strepx2-myc-EMP47, Strepx2-HA-EMP46, and Strepx2-myc-EMP47-Δ281–333, respectively, these fragments were generated by PCR and subcloned into pASK-IBA4 (Sigma). The plasmid pKSE136 encoding MBP-UFE1 was constructed by cloning the PCR fragment of UFE1 into pMAL-p2 (New England Biolabs). Protein Expression and Purification—Strepx2-myc-Emp47p, Strepx2-HA-Emp46p, and Strepx2-myc-Emp47p-Δ281–333 were purified from Escherichia coli JM109 cells containing the respective plasmids. The cells were cultured at 30 °C and induced with tetracycline (200 μg/liter). After 3 h, the cells were collected and washed once with buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm KOAc). The total membrane fraction was prepared by sonication in buffer A with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifugation at 42,000 rpm (Hitachi P45AT rotor). The membrane was solubilized with 2.5% (w/v) N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside in buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 160 mm KOAc) containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 1 h. After the removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation, supernatant was applied to a Streptactin-Sepharose (Sigma) column equilibrated with buffer B containing 1.25% (w/v) N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The column was washed with the same buffer, and then Strep-tagged protein was eluted with buffer B containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. MBP-Ufe1p was purified from JM109 cells carrying the plasmid pKSE136. After 3-h induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the total membrane fraction was solubilized by the same method as above. The solubilized membrane was applied to an Amylose resin (New England Biolabs), washed with the same buffer, and then MBP-Ufe1p was eluted with buffer B containing 10 mm maltose. Preparation of Proteoliposomes—Lipid composition of the major-minor mix and PC/PE has been described previously (7.Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). All proteoliposomes used contained 80% phospholipids and 20% of cholesterol. Aliquots of lipid solutions in chloroform (0.99-mg lipids) were placed in a glass tube, and solvents were removed by a gentle stream of nitrogen to yield a lipid film. Lipids were hydrated with buffer B containing 1.25% (w/v) N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside by bath sonication, and then protein solution was added (total 1 ml). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the solution was dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer B containing Bio-Beads SM-2 at room temperature for 3 h and then overnight at 4 °C. Proteoliposomes were recovered by flotation in a Nycodenz (Sigma) step gradient. Each 1-ml dialysate was mixed with the same amount of 80% (w/v) Nycodenz in buffer B and then overlaid with 2 ml of 30% (w/v) Nycodenz in buffer B followed by 1 ml of buffer B. The sample was then centrifuged in an RPS65T rotor (Hitachi) at 60,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The proteoliposomes were collected from the 0/30% Nycodenz interface followed by ultracentrifugation to recover proteoliposomes, which were resuspended in buffer B and stored at -80 °C. Size distribution profiles of proteoliposomes were measured by dynamic light scattering using LB-500 (Horiba) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Solubilization of proteoliposomes followed by size exclusion chromatography of reconstituted Emp46/47p was performed as described previously (13.Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Assay of COPII Binding to Proteoliposomes—Reactions contained 1.6 μg of Sar1p, 1.7 μg of Sec23/24p, 2 μg of Sec13/31p, 0.1 mm GMP-PNP or GDP, and 9.9 μg (lipids) of proteoliposomes in buffer B containing 1 mm MgOAc (total volume 50 μl). After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, reactions were mixed with the equal volume of 80% (w/v) Nycodenz in buffer B and then overlaid with 75 μl of 30% (w/v) Nycodenz in buffer B followed by 10 μl of buffer B. The resulting step gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a Hitachi 100AT3 rotor for 1 h. Samples (25 μl) were collected from the top and the recovery of NBD-labeled phospholipids were determined by the fluorescence. After normalization for lipid recovery, proteins in the fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Vesicle Budding Assay—For proteoliposome budding assays, proteoliposomes (corresponding to 9.9 μg of phospholipids) were incubated with 8.4 μg of Sar1p, 10 μg of Sec23/24p, 11 μg of Sec13/31p, and 0.1 mm GMP-PNP or GDP in buffer B containing 1 mm MgOAc (total volume 100 μl) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was loaded on a 20–40% sucrose gradient in buffer B with 1 mm MgOAc and centrifuged for 22 h in an RPS40T rotor at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient, and the fluorescence peak fraction was used as the vesicle fraction. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. For microsome budding assays, microsomes expressing indicated proteins were incubated with saturate amount of COPII proteins with 0.1 mm guanine nucleotides, 1 mm ATP, and ATP regeneration system as described before (13.Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Vesicles were generated from proteoliposomes as described above, and the COPII vesicle peak was collected by ultra-centrifugation and processed for thin-section electron microscopy as described previously (14.Matsuoka K. Schekman R. Methods. 2000; 20: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Light Scattering and Tryptophan Fluorescence Assays—The scattering of light (λ = 350 nm) was measured at 90° in a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-2500) equipped with a thermostatically controlled cell holder. The cuvette initially contained a suspension of proteoliposomes (corresponding to 9.9 μg of phospholipids) in buffer B containing 1 mm MgCl2. Sar1p, Sec23/24p, Sec13/31p, and GMP-PNP or GTP were added at the indicated times. Tryptophan fluorescence was recorded at 340 nm upon excitation at 298 nm. Free Mg2+ concentration in the reaction was temporarily decreased by the addition of EDTA to accelerate GDP/GTP exchange as described before. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Reconstitution of Cargo Proteins—Emp47p, a type-I membrane protein, is specifically required for the transport of an integral membrane protein, Emp46p, from the ER (13.Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal tail of Emp47p includes COPII binding signals and this protein was shown to be packaged into COPII vesicles (15.Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2518-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We chose these Emp46/47p and resident ER membrane protein, Ufe1p, for this study. To express Emp47p and Emp46p on E. coli membrane, the signal sequences of Emp46/47p were replaced with that of E. coli OmpA followed by two tandem repeats of Strep-tag for affinity purification. Ufe1p was tagged with a maltose-binding protein (MBP) at its NH2 terminus to express on E. coli membrane. These proteins were separately expressed on E. coli membranes and purified by affinity chromatography. The full-length proteins were obtained in a detergent solution and the purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To reconstitute the Emp46/47p and MBP-Ufe1p into liposomes, phospholipids whose composition resembles yeast ER membranes (major-minor mix), previously defined as the optimal composition for coat recruitment (7.Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), were mixed with purified proteins in the presence of the octylglucoside. After detergent removal by dialysis, the resulting proteoliposomes were isolated by flotation in a density gradient (Fig. 1a). A quantitative assessment of the protease accessibility to the NH2 terminus of reconstituted Emp46/47p and MBP-Ufe1p revealed that 20–30% of Emp46/47p and 100% of MBP-Ufe1p were inserted with the same relative orientation as in the ER membrane (data not shown). Both dynamic laser light scattering and transmission electron microscopy indicated a mean diameter of the resulting proteoliposomes of about 200 nm, and no vesicles smaller than 100 nm were observed (Fig. 1b). We have shown before that Emp47p alone forms a 600-kDa homooligomer through the coiled-coil region of the luminal domain in the ER, which is essential for the exit of Emp47p from the ER. In contrast, Emp46p alone exists as a monomer in the ER, and 600-kDa heterooligomer formation with Emp47p is required for the Emp46p to be incorporated into COPII vesicles (13.Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although no such heterooligomer formation was observed when separately purified Emp47p and Emp46p were mixed in octylglucoside solution before reconstitution, they assembled efficiently into a 600-kDa heterooligomer when they were reconstituted into liposomes as judged by gel filtration (Fig. 1c). When proteoliposomes were prepared with the coiled-coil deleted mutant, Emp47p-Δ281–333, or Emp46p, these proteins were eluted at lower molecular mass positions, most consistent with their monomer sizes. Thus, it seems unlikely that the 600-kDa complex is nonspecific aggregates or monomeric forms of each molecule surrounded by detergent micelles. We conclude that Emp47p and Emp46p spontaneously form heterooligomers on the reconstituted membrane. Efficient Formation of COPII-coated Vesicles Requires Assembled Emp47p—We tested the ability of COPII components to bind to the proteoliposomes (Fig. 1d). Assembly of Sec23/24p and Sec13/31p onto synthetic liposomes (major-minor-mix) was observed in a Sar1p-GMP-PNP-dependent manner as has been shown before (7.Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Similarly, Sec23/24p and Sec13/31p formed a Sar1p-GMP-PNP-dependent complex on Emp47p-reconstituted proteoliposomes. We next addressed whether COPII components might bind directly to reconstituted Emp47p. It has been shown previously that Sar1p-GMP-PNP binds to neutral liposomes (PC/PE) but that the subsequent binding of Sec23/24p requires the presence of acidic phospholipids (7.Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Emp47p was reconstituted into the neutral liposomes that do not support the Sec23/24p recruitment and COPII recruitment was assessed. When Emp47p alone was reconstituted into the neutral liposomes, the efficiency of incorporation was ∼10% compared with the major-minor mix liposomes. Successful reconstitution of Emp47p into the neutral liposomes required the co-existence of MBP-Ufe1p for unknown reasons. The presence of Emp47p in the neutral liposomes supported the recruitment of Sec23/24p and Sec13/31p in a Sar1p-GMP-PNP dependent manner, although the recruitment efficiency was quite low (less than 5% of the major-minor mix). Because the carboxyl-terminal region of Emp47p in the neutral liposomes is the only portion that could interact directly with Sec23/24p, we conclude that COPII directly binds to reconstituted Emp47p. Since COPII binding to proteoliposomes behaved similarly to plain liposomes, we assessed the real-time coat assembly using a light-scattering assay (Fig. 1e). Binding of COPII proteins to liposomes leads to an increase in mass that can be detected by monitoring changes in light scattering (16.Antonny B. Madden D. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The addition of GMP-PNP to the Sec23/24p, Sec13/31p, and Sar1p-loaded liposomes generated a large increase in light scattering within 350 s. In contrast, the kinetics of Sec23/24p and Sec13/31p recruitment to the Emp47p-reconstituted proteoliposomes was increased (150 s). Inclusion of monomeric Emp47p-Δ281–333 in liposomes, which we have shown previously to bind COPII but not allow COPII vesicle incorporation (13.Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), yielded a rapid increase in light scattering, which was almost identical to the case of Emp47p. Our data demonstrate that the presence of cargo on membranes enhances the rate of COPII recruitment and suggest that the cargo molecules actively participate in the recruitment of the COPII coat. This high affinity binding of COPII subunits to cargo might significantly improve the capture of cargo molecules as does the binding to acidic phospholipids. Based on the finding that COPII coat can bind directly to reconstituted Emp47p with an increased rate, we next asked whether the presence of cargo in the membrane affects COPII budding from proteoliposomes. It has been shown before that synthetic COPII vesicles bud from protein-free liposomes in the presence of Sec23/24p, Sec13/31p, and Sar1p-GMP-PNP (7.Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes containing Emp46/47p and MBP-Ufe1p were incubated with purified Sec23/24p, Sec13/31p, and Sar1p in the presence of GMP-PNP or GDP, and then the reaction was centrifuged on a linear sucrose-density gradient to separate the coated vesicles from the parental proteoliposomes. The recovery of lipids in each fraction was monitored by measuring the fluorescence of NBD-phospholipids included in the proteoliposomes. When incubated with GMP-PNP, the high density peak (fractions 5–9) was detected with a corresponding decrease in the low density peak (fractions 1–3), whereas the proteoliposomes incubated with GDP remained at the top of the gradient (Fig. 2a). The high density fractions expected to contain coated vesicles were further analyzed by electron microscopy to examine their identity, and we confirmed that this high density peak indeed consisted of coated vesicles (Fig. 2c). The fractions were also analyzed by immunoblotting to establish the distribution of Emp46/47p. Most of Emp46/47p was found (∼80%) in the high density peak (fractions 5–8) along with the phospholipid peak when incubated with GMP-PNP, whereas almost all of Emp46/47p remained at the top of the gradient in the presence of GDP. In contrast, when proteoliposomes containing monomeric Emp47p-Δ281–333 and Emp46p were tested, both of which were shown to be deficient in the ER export, a decreased level of coated vesicle budding was observed (Fig. 2b). Considering that monomeric forms of Emp47p and Emp46p can bind the COPII coat, our data indicate that the simple binding of COPII components to the membrane via monomeric cargo is not sufficient for efficient COPII vesicle production, but binding to oligomerized cargo is required. In other words, COPII binding to oligomerized cargo with a particular spatial arrangement on the membrane probably promotes efficient coat polymerization which drives vesicle formation. We next monitored the extent of incorporation of Emp46/47p and MBP-Ufe1p into vesicles generated from proteoliposomes (Fig. 2d). Starting proteoliposomes were compared with gradient-purified COPII vesicles by quantitative immunoblotting normalized to the intensity of NBD phospholipid fluorescence. A range of 1.5–2-fold concentration of Emp46/47p was detected in several replications of this experiment. This efficiency of sorting is not what can be achieved with microsomes and purified COPII components (3∼4-fold enrichment of Emp47p relative to phospholipid). 2K. Sato and A. Nakano, unpublished data. One reason for this might be that the parental proteoliposomes (mean diameter 200 nm) used in this assay can vesiculate into only a small number of COPII vesicles (50∼60 nm). Furthermore, our system includes only 20∼30% of correctly oriented Emp46/47p, thereby the opposite oriented species provide low estimation of cargo enrichment. On the other hand, control protein, MBP-Ufe1p, was neither concentrated nor depleted in proteoliposome-derived COPII vesicles (∼1.1-fold enrichment). Although it is not clear whether the ER resident protein Ufe1p has a nature to prevent its ER export, the above result showed that our system comprising the minimal set of COPII proteins do not includes active exclusion mechanisms of ER residents. Effect of Emp47p on the GTPase-activating Protein Activity of Sec23p—Sec23/24p interacts with membrane-bound Sar1p-GTP and the export motifs of transmembrane cargos to form the pre-budding complex, which is prerequisite for Sec13/31p recruitment to yield COPII vesicles. The fact that the GTPase-activating protein of Sar1p, Sec23p, is a subunit of the coat complicated this event and if and how this step is regulated on the membrane by cargo molecules remains unknown. This issue is now testable with our budding-competent proteoliposomes. We examined a single round of real-time coat assembly and disassembly in the presence of GTP by light scattering as reported before (Fig. 3a) (16.Antonny B. Madden D. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). On Sar1p-GTP pre-loaded plain liposomes, addition of Sec23/24p yielded an instant increase in light scattering that persisted for ∼200 s. Strikingly, addition of Sec23/24p to Emp47por Emp47p-Δ281–333-reconstituted proteoliposomes also generated an immediate binding signal, but this signal was more transient, continuing for ∼120 s. We next examined whether this accelerated pre-budding complex disassembly in the presence of the cargo might be due to activated GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p (Fig. 3b). We directly tested the GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p as stimulated by Sec23/24p using a tryptophan fluorescence assay that perceives Sar1p-GTP and Sar1p-GDP as established before (16.Antonny B. Madden D. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In the presence of Emp47p or Emp47p-Δ281–333, the GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p was ∼1.4-fold more efficient than without cargo, in agreement with the more transient binding in the presence of cargo detected by light scattering. To study the role of GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p more precisely in terms of cargo sorting, we performed in vitro budding assays with microsomes in the presence of GMP-PNP or GTP to determine whether GTP hydrolysis influenced the cargo sorting into COPII vesicles (Fig. 3c). COPII vesicle fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The signals were then compared with a standard curve of known amounts of microsomal membranes. When a budding reaction was performed in the presence of GTP, a lower level (0.3%) of monomeric Emp47p-Δ281–333 was detected in the COPII vesicle fraction as compared with wild-type oligomeric Emp47p (3.8%) as we reported before. In marked contrast, when vesicles were generated in the presence of GMP-PNP, the level of Emp47p-Δ281–333 was significantly higher (1.6%). The levels of other cargos found in the vesicle fractions such as wild-type Emp47p, Sec22p, and Sed5p were similar under GTP and GMP-PNP conditions, indicating a preferential incorporation of monomeric Emp47p-Δ281–333 in the absence of Sar1p GTP hydrolysis. The Emp47p-Δ281–333 mutant lacking the ability to assemble into an oligomer might mimic the transient state of newly synthesized unassembled Emp47p in the ER. Such an unassembled cargo has an ability to bind coat subunits via the COOH-terminal signal but should be efficiently excluded from COPII vesicles. From these data, we suggest that Sar1p selectively promotes exclusion of improper proteins from COPII vesicles by GTP hydrolysis. It has been shown that GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p triggers uncoating of the COPII coat from the vesicles, in which case Sar1p may not play a direct role for cargo sorting. This scenario is based on the facts that in vitro generated COPII vesicles in the presence of GMP-PNP or GTPγS remain coated and could be a functional intermediate of transport after coat removal (3.Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) (17.Oka T. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As GTP hydrolysis of Sar1p leads to the release of COPII coat from the ER membrane, i.e. COPII coat has a short intrinsic lifetime on membranes (16.Antonny B. Madden D. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), a counteracting mechanism was thought to be needed to support vesicle formation (17.Oka T. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (18.Antonny B. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The proposed model was that the GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p in the pre-budding complex is temporally restricted to ensure cargo capture and coat polymerization. In the light of our new findings, an alternative model should be developed to explain the cargo-dependent stimulation of Sar1p GTPase during COPII vesicle formation, and we favor the existence of an additional role for GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p besides that shown in uncoating. We propose here a “kinetic proof-reading” model outlined in Fig. 4. The pre-budding complex with assembled cargo has a high rate to polymerize into COPII vesicles before GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p (Fig. 2a). By contrast, the pre-budding complex with unassembled cargo also has an ability to bind COPII coat (Fig. 1e), but polymerization proceeds slowly (Fig. 2b). The high GTP hydrolysis rate of Sar1p counteracts the pre-budding complex polymerization with unassembled cargo, ensuring that only the pre-budding complex with correct cargo is successfully incorporated into COPII vesicles. COPI-dependent sorting of Golgi resident proteins has been reported to require GTP hydrolysis by ARF1 (19.Lanoix J. Ouwendijk J. Lin C.C. Stark A. Love H.D. Ostermann J. Nilsson T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4935-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 20.Lanoix J. Ouwendijk J. Stark A. Szafer E. Cassel D. Dejgaard K. Weiss M. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1199-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although similar components are required for both COPII- and COPI-dependent transport and similar basic mechanisms operate commonly, they may adopt different ways for protein sorting. COPI binds to the membrane proteins that are retrieved back from the Golgi to the ER via the COOH-terminal K(X)KXX motifs in their cytosolic tails (21.Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 22.Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, no such a simple transplantable motif for COPII binding has yet been identified, and multiple signals including oligomer formation are required in many cases (13.Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23.Doms R.W. Keller D.S. Helenius A. Balch W.E. J.

A requirement for multiple signals in ER cargos might be important in terms of the ER quality control. ER contains a certain amount of newly synthesized unassembled cargo, which should be segregated from secretory proteins. A requirement for combinational signals could operate efficient exclusion of unassembled cargo from COPII vesicles, thereby the ER might require different mechanisms from Golgi in protein sorting. Our results indicating stimulation of the Sar1p GTPase activity by cargo do not exclude the contribution of other factors in this process. Nevertheless, the unpredicted function of Sar1p during cargo sorting shown in this study provides an avenue toward the investigation of molecular mechanisms of cargo sorting during vesicle formation.

In this study, we examined whether rodent fibroblasts that conditionally express c-Myc undergo a similar mechanism of cell death in response to serum or oxygen deprivation. Our results demonstrate that murine embryonic fibroblasts from bax-/-bak-/- mice that conditionally express c-Myc did not die in response to either oxygen or serum deprivation. Fibroblasts from p53-/- mice that conditionally express c-Myc died in response to oxygen (but not serum) deprivation. The inability of p53 to regulate oxygen deprivation-induced cell death was due to the lack of induction of p53 target genes Puma, Noxa, and Pten. In contrast, serum deprivation transcriptionally induced Puma and Pten in cells that conditionally express c-Myc. The failure of p53 to regulate oxygen deprivation-induced cell death led us to hypothesize whether hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) might be a critical regulator of cell death during oxygen deprivation. Fibroblasts from HIF-1β-/- cells that conditionally express c-Myc were not able to transcriptionally activate HIF during oxygen deprivation. These cells died in response to oxygen deprivation. Thus, oxygen deprivation-induced cell death in fibroblasts with deregulated expression of c-Myc is independent of p53 or HIF-1 status, but is dependent on the Bcl-2 family member Bax or Bak to initiate mitochondrial dependent cell death.

The proto-oncogene c-Myc is a transcription factor that forms a heterodimer with Max and activates genes involved in proliferation (1Amati B. Brooks M.W. Levy N. Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Land H. Cell. 1993; 72: 233-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, cells expressing c-Myc rapidly undergo cell death under conditions in which survival factors are limiting (reviewed in Ref. 2Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2967-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The molecular machinery that regulates c-Myc-induced cell death is distinct and independent from proliferation because activation of the molecular machinery mediating cell cycle progression is not required for c-Myc-induced cell death (3Conzen S.D.

The fact that c-Myc can sensitize to so many different triggers of cell death suggests an action at some common point in the death machinery. Previous studies have demonstrated that Myc-induced sensitization to death stimuli is mediated through changes in outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol (14Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 15Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell.

Recent studies have indicated that key regulators of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization are the Bcl-2 family proteins (reviewed in Refs. 16Green D.R.

Bcl-2 family proteins are also key downstream targets of the transcription factor p53 or survival-signaling pathways such as that initiated by insulin-like growth factor-1. Insulin-like growth factor-1 or loss of p53 can inhibit growth factor or serum deprivation-induced death in cells with deregulated c-Myc (4Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N.

The ability of Myc to concurrently induce proliferation and cell death has led to the proposal that death due to inadequate survival factors provides a mechanism to guard against the appearance of neoplastic clones that can lead to unrestrained cell growth. Tumors with deregulated Myc expression require a continuous supply of survival factors or the acquisition of mutations such as in the p53 pathway or overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (32Alarcon R.M Rupnow B.A. Graeber T.G.

Two survival factors that are likely to be limiting to induce cell death in tumors with deregulated c-Myc are growth factors and oxygen. Presently, it remains unknown whether loss of either oxygen or growth factors elicits a similar death pathway in cells with deregulated c-Myc expression. In this study, we investigated the role of p53 and Bcl-2 proteins in regulating oxygen deprivation-induced cell death in fibroblasts that express a conditionally active c-Myc and compared these genetic manipulations in the same cells exposed to serum deprivation.

Primary MEFs were generated from wild-type, p53-/-, or bax-/-bak-/- embryos. Rat1a fibroblasts or MEFs stably expressing a cDNA encoding human c-Myc fused at its C terminus to the hormone binding domain of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-responsive mutant murine estrogen receptor (MycER) were established by retroviral infection as previously described (35Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Rat1a fibroblasts containing MycER and expressing Bcl-xL or dominant-negative p53 (GSE56) were established by retroviral infection as described previously (36Gottlob K. Kennedy S. Kandel E.

Primary MEFs were generated from HIF-1β+/+ and HIF-1β-/- embryos and subsequently immortalized with a plasmid containing the large T antigen.

Measurement of Cell Death—Cell death was assayed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity in culture supernatants from cells plated on 60-mm culture plates using the cytotoxicity detection kit from Roche Applied Science according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 500 μl of medium was removed, and the remaining cells were lysed by adding the same volume of 0.5% Triton X-100. After 30 min, 500 μl of the lysate was removed. The samples were incubated for 30 min with buffer containing NAD+, lactate, and tetrazolium. Lactate dehydrogenase converts lactate to pyruvate, generating NADH. The NADH then reduces tetrazolium (yellow) to formazan (red), which was detected at 490 mm. Lactate dehydrogenase release is expressed as the percentage of the lactate dehydrogenase measured in the medium over the total lactate dehydrogenase released after treating with Triton X-100. Measurement of Cytochrome c Release and Caspase-9 Activation— Rat1a/MycER cells were plated on 60-mm culture dishes at 30-40% confluence and exposed to experimental conditions. Both adherent and non-adherent cells were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g. The resulting pellet was then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged again for 5 min at 200 × g. The cells were subsequently resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged on microscope glass plates at 200 × g for 5 min (Cytospin®-3 Cytocentrifuge, Shandon). The cells were then incubated at 20 °C for 5 min in methanol/acetone (1:1) and blocked for 45 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Following blocking, the cells were removed, air-dried, and incubated for 2 h with a 1:500 dilution of anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody 7H8.2C12 (Pharmingen) at 37 °C in a humidified environment. The cells were then washed for 4 × 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, air-dried, and incubated for 1 h with a 1:50 dilution of a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon International, Inc.). Subsequently, the cells were washed as before, air-dried, and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The cells were then visualized via fluorescence microscopy (15Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 enzymatic activity was determined in cytosolic extracts by LEHD-cleaving activity using a fluorometric assay kit (R&D Systems). Data were normalized using total protein concentration as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Reporter Assays—Transfections of HIF-1β+/+ and HIF-1β-/- MEFs were carried out on cells plated on 60-mm Petri dishes at 50% confluence using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A typical transfection was performed using 2.0 μg of a firefly luciferase reporter driven by a trimer of a hypoxic response element (HRE-luciferase) and 50 ng of Renilla luciferase driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (TK-luciferase; Promega). HRE-luciferase reporter constructs consisted of a trimerized 24-mer containing 18 bp of sequence from the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega). Values are reported as a ratio of HRE-luciferase to TK-luciferase. RNA Isolation and Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells grown in monolayers using a modified guanidine isothiocyanate protocol (TRIzol reagent, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression of p21, Puma, Noxa, and Pten was determined by real-time quantitative PCR using the ABI 7700 sequence detector system (PDAR, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the TaqMan gold reverse transcription-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). Murine primers and probes were selected based on nucleotide sequences downloaded from the NCBI Data Bank and designed by Primer Express Software 1.0 (Applied Biosystems): Puma sense, 5′-TGCACTGATGGAGATACGGACTT-3′; Puma antisense, 5′-ACCATGAGTCCTTCAGCCCTC-3′; Puma TaqMan probe, 5′-CCTGGCCTCCCGAAAGCCAGG-3′; Pten sense, 5′-GCCACAGGCTCCCAGACAT-3′; Pten antisense, 5′-TCCATCCTCTTGATATCTCCTTTTG-3′; Pten TaqMan probe, 5′-ACAGCCATCATCAAAGAGATCGTTAGCAGAA-3′; p21 sense, 5′-CTGTTCCGCACAGGAGCAA-3′; p21 antisense, 5′-CGCAACTGCTCACTGTCCA-3′; p21 TaqMan probe, 5′-TGTGCCGTTGTCTCTTCGGTCCC-3′; Noxa sense, 5′-CTGGGAAGTCGCAAAAGAGC-3′; Noxa antisense, 5′-CCTTCAAGTCTGCTGGCACC-3′; and Noxa TaqMan probe 5′-ATGAGGAGCCCAAGCCCAACCC-3′. The TaqMan probe consists of an oligonucleotide with a 5′-reporter dye (6-carboxyfluorescein) and a 3′-quencher dye (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine). The reaction mixture was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). All samples were read in duplicate, and values were normalized for base-line expression and for expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (internal reference). Immunoblotting—The primary antibodies used for immunoblotting were anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene Research) at a concentration of 4.0 μg/ml and anti-α-tubulin clone B-5-1-2 (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (Cell Signaling) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Cell lysates were prepared using cell lysis buffer (New England Biolabs Inc.) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. c-Myc Sensitizes Rat1a Fibroblasts to Serum or Oxygen Deprivation-induced Cell Death—Deregulated c-Myc expression in Rat1a fibroblasts without serum or oxygen has been demonstrated to cause death (6Evan G.I.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Rat1a fibroblasts were stably transfected with a fusion protein containing a modified hormone-binding domain of the murine estrogen receptor and the full-length human c-Myc protein (Rat1a/MycER cells) (35Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). This c-Myc chimeric protein can be activated by the addition of (100 nm) to cell cultures. Rat1a/MycER cells were cultured at low confluence (30-40%) under normal oxygen conditions (21% O2) in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 25 mm HEPES to buffer any changes in pH. Rat1a/MycER cells were incubated with or without OHT for 16 h. Subsequently, Rat1a/MycER cells were deprived of either serum or oxygen for 16 and 24 h. Total cell death was measured by lactate dehydrogenase release. The addition of OHT accelerated cell death in these cells when deprived of either serum or oxygen (Fig. 1, A and B). In accordance with previous studies, our present data demonstrate that expression of c-Myc accelerates cell death following oxygen or serum deprivation. c-Myc Sensitization to Serum (but Not Oxygen) Deprivation-induced Cell Death Requires p53—The cell death activity of p53 has been suggested to be responsible for suppression of Myc-mediated tumorigenesis (38Schmitt C.A Fridman J.S. Yang M. Baranov E. Hoffman R.M. Lowe S.W. Cancer Cells. 2002; 1: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Studies have also demonstrated that c-Myc-mediated cell death is dependent on p53 in rodent fibroblasts (4Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). We examined the role of p53 in our Rat1a/MycER cells by stably expressing a dominant-negative mutant of p53 (DNp53). In control experiments, Rat1a/MycER cells containing DNp53 were markedly protected against daunorubicin-induced cell death (Fig. 2A). Rat1a/MycER cells containing DNp53 and incubated with OHT were protected from serum (but not oxygen) deprivation-induced cell death (Fig. 2, B and C). We further confirmed our findings by expressing the conditional OHT-dependent c-Myc protein in MEFs from wild-type (p53+/+/MycER MEFs) and p53-null (p53-/-/MycER MEFs) animals. Both p53+/+/MycER and p53-/-/MycER cells were incubated with OHT for 16 h and subsequently deprived of either serum or oxygen for 24 h. p53-/-/MycER cells incubated with OHT were protected from serum deprivation-induced cell death (Fig. 3). In contrast, p53-/-/MycER cells incubated with OHT were not protected from oxygen deprivation-induced cell death. Collectively these results indicate that p53 is required for serum (but not oxygen) deprivation-induced cell death in rodent fibroblasts that conditionally express c-Myc.Fig. 3Wild-type or p53-/- MEFs that express a conditional OHT-dependent c-Myc protein were incubated under normal oxygen conditions with 10% FBS in the presence of OHT (100 nm) for 16 h. Subsequently, cell death was measured in cells deprived of either oxygen or serum for 24 h.

In accordance with these previous reports, stable overexpression of Bcl-xL prevented cell death in Rat1a/MycER cells incubated with OHT for 16 h and subsequently deprived of either serum or oxygen for 16 and 24 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Recent studies have indicated that the ability of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL to inhibit cell death is through prevention of Bax or Bak from causing outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (reviewed in Ref. 39Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). To test whether Bax or Bak is required for oxygen or serum deprivation-induced cell death in cells overexpressing c-Myc, the conditional OHT-dependent c-Myc protein was expressed in MEFs from wild-type (WT/MycER MEFs) and Baxand Baknull animals (bax-/-bak-/-/MycER MEFs). Both WT/MycER and bax-/-bak-/-/MycER MEFs were incubated with OHT for 16 h and subsequently deprived of either serum or oxygen for 24 h. The bax-/-bak-/-/MycER cells incubated with OHT were protected from both serum and oxygen deprivation-induced cell death (Fig. 5). These results indicate that both serum and oxygen deprivation-induced cell death pathways converge on Bax or Bak to cause outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization.Fig. 5Wild-type or bax-/-bak-/- fibroblasts that express a conditional OHT-dependent c-Myc protein were incubated under normal oxygen conditions with 10% FBS in the presence of OHT (100 nm) for 16 h.

Cells release cytochrome c early in the course of cell death due to loss of outer mitochondrial membrane integrity. Cytochrome c in the cytosol binds to Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor-1), which then undergoes a conformational change that allows the cleavage and activation of caspase-9 (40Li P.

Rat1a/MycER cells were incubated with OHT for 16 h, subsequently deprived of either serum or oxygen for 16 h, and analyzed for cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation. It is important to note that there was minimal cell death at 16 h in response to either death stimulus (see Fig. 1). The addition of OHT resulted in increased levels of cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation in Rat1a/MycER cells following oxygen or serum deprivation compared with cells that did not receive OHT (Fig. 6). Rat1a/MycER cells overexpressing Bcl-xL did not release cytochrome c or activate caspase-9 upon deprivation of serum or oxygen in the presence of OHT (Fig. 6). In contrast, Rat1a/MycER cells containing DNp53 in the presence of OHT released cytochrome c and activated caspase-9 in response to oxygen (but not serum) deprivation (Fig. 6). Thus, Bcl-xL prevents both the cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation in Rat1a cells conditionally expressing c-Myc upon serum or oxygen deprivation. The loss of p53 function prevents only serum deprivation-induced cell death in Rat1a fibroblasts conditionally expressing c-Myc at a level upstream of cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation. Oxygen Deprivation Fails to Activate p53 Target Genes in Cells with Deregulated c-Myc Expression—To further understand why p53 is required only under conditions of serum (but not oxygen) deprivation, we examined p53 protein levels and p53 transcriptionally regulated genes p21, Puma, Noxa, and Pten in WT/MycER MEFs in the absence of either serum or oxygen. Puma and Noxa are BH3 proteins that can activate Bax or Bak and have been implicated in p53-dependent cell death (44Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). Pten is a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent cellular survival signal and has been shown to be required for p53-mediated cell death in immortalized MEFs (45Stambolic V. MacPherson D. Sas D. Lin Y. Snow B. Jang Y. Benchimol S. Mak T.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 317-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that c-Myc favors the initiation of cell death by inhibiting the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and allowing the p53-dependent expression of cell death genes such as Puma (46Seoane J. Le H.V. Massagué J. Nature. 2002; 419: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). WT/MycER MEFs were incubated with OHT for 16 h and deprived of either serum or oxygen for 6 h (prior to any cell death), and the levels of p53 protein and p53 target genes were assessed. WT/MycER MEFs treated with OHT stabilized p53 protein levels under normal oxygen conditions as well as serum or oxygen deprivation (Fig. 7A). However, the p53 target genes Puma and Pten were expressed only under normal oxygen conditions or serum deprivation in the presence of OHT (Fig. 7B). Noxa mRNA levels"

Some of these intermediates are very transient and difficult to obtain in significant amounts, due to the high efficiency and processivity of integrase, the lack of requirements for external energy factors or metal ions, and the highly reversible nature of each of the intermediates. We have previously used mixture-based combinatorial libraries to identify hexapeptides that trap 40–60% of recombination substrates at the Holliday junction stage of the reaction. These inhibitors discriminate between the four pathways, blocking one of them (bent-L recombination) more severely than the others and blocking the excision pathway least. We presume that these differences reflect specific conformational differences of the nucleoprotein intermediates in each pathway. We have now identified new inhibitors of the excision pathway. One of these, WRWYCR, is over 50-fold more potent at inhibiting excision than the previously identified peptides. This peptide stably traps Holliday junction complexes in all recombination pathways mediated by integrase as well as Cre. This finding and other data presented indicate that the peptide's target is a common feature shared by the Holliday junction complexes assembled by tyrosine recombinases.

This assay is particularly useful for determining junction resolution rates in cases where complexes directly assembled on junction substrates undergo little or no catalysis. Tyrosine recombinases catalyze site-specific recombination between partner sequences via two rounds of single-stranded cleavage, exchange, and ligation (see Fig. 1) (1Van Duyne G.D. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 93-117Google Scholar, 2Azaro M.A. Landy A. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 117-148Google Scholar). Because catalysis on the “top” strands of each substrate is separated temporally from catalysis on the “bottom” strands, a Holliday junction is made during the first round of catalysis and resolved during the second round. Normally, the Holliday junction is extremely transient, and no more than ∼2% of substrates accumulate at this stage, making this intermediate recalcitrant to study. We have previously identified several hexapeptides that trap substrates at the Holliday junction stage (3Casell G.D. Klemm M. Pinilla C. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1193-1202Google Scholar).

Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 117-148Google Scholar). In addition to these two pathways, Int catalyzes recombination between two attL partner sites; the IHF-stimulated bent-L pathway is as efficient as integration and excision, whereas the IHF-inhibited pathway is very inefficient (6Kikuchi A.

When we tested the ability of the WKHYNY and KWWCRW hexapeptides to trap Holliday junctions in these pathways, we found that they are most effective at trapping junctions in bent-L recombination and integration but 10–20-fold less effective in excisive recombination (4Klemm M. Cheng C. Cassell G. Shuman S. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1203-1216Google Scholar, 5Cassell G.D. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 413-429Google Scholar). Peptides WKHYNY and KWWCRW were isolated using the bent-L pathway during the screening process. In order to understand how the target of the peptides differs among the Int-mediated pathways, we repeated our screen for peptides using excisive recombination as the assay. We have identified a new set of hexapeptides that act as dimers and trap Holliday junctions in the excision pathway as well as in the other pathways. Like peptide KWWCRW, they also inhibit DNA cleavage by type I topoisomerases and restriction endonucleases at high concentration. Reversal of the dimerization by DTT results in dissociation of the peptides from the Holliday junction complexes and allows their resolution by the stably bound Int. We now have a way both to stop the reaction in the middle and measure the accumulation rate of Holliday junctions and to release the block and measure the disappearance rate of junctions due to resolution in the context of the actual reaction intermediates.Table IThe four pathways of phage λ Int-mediated recombinationIntegrationExcisionBent-LStraight-LSubstratesattB, attPattL, attRattLaFor this pathway, the P′1 arm site has to be mutated in vitro but not in vivo (attL tenP′1) to prevent Int binding at this locationattLRequirementsInt, IHF, scbsc attP, supercoiled attP; supercoiling of the attP site is necessary for its synapsis with attB in this pathway attPInt, IHF, Xis, FIScFIS is required only in vivo for this pathway; in vitro, a second Xis monomer fulfills the function of FISInt, IHFIntEfficiencyHighdWe consider a pathway to be highly efficient when >20% of the substrate is converted to product (usually 30-50% for bent-L and >50% for integration and excision; because the latter pathways are unidirectional, accumulated products cannot recombine to regenerate substrates, as in the bent-L pathway)HighHighLowDirectionalityUnidirectionalUnidirectionalBidirectionalBidirectionala For this pathway, the P′1 arm site has to be mutated in vitro but not in vivo (attL tenP′1) to prevent Int binding at this locationb sc attP, supercoiled attP; supercoiling of the attP site is necessary for its synapsis with attB in this pathwayc FIS is required only in vivo for this pathway; in vitro, a second Xis monomer fulfills the function of FISd We consider a pathway to be highly efficient when >20% of the substrate is converted to product (usually 30-50% for bent-L and >50% for integration and excision; because the latter pathways are unidirectional, accumulated products cannot recombine to regenerate substrates, as in the bent-L pathway) Open table in a new tab EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Substrates and Proteins—DNA substrates were generated by PCR using plasmid templates containing cloned attL, attLtenP′1, attR, attB, or lox sites. Substrates were radiolabeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Supercoiled attP and pUC19 plasmids were isolated from Escherichia coli strains and purified using the Promega Wizard Plus SV Midiprep kit. Int was expressed under the control of a phage T7 promoter in the BL21(DE3)pLysS expression strain. It was purified as previously described (8Nash H.A. Bauer C.E. Gardner J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4049-4053Google Scholar), 2C. Robertson and H. A. Nash, personal communication. with the modification that a Macro-Prep High S Support (Bio-Rad) column was used in lieu of a hydroxylapatite column. The buffers and salt gradient used for eluting the protein from the S resin column were identical to those used for the hydroxylapatite column by C. Robertson. The resulting protein is greater than 99% pure judged by Coomassie Blue staining of a protein gel.The Xis protein was expressed from a plasmid generated by Steven Goodman, encoding the xis gene with an N-terminal 6× His tag, under control of the T7 promoter. The plasmid was freshly transformed into the BL21(DE3)pLysS expression strain. An overnight culture was subcultured 1:100 into LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol (to maintain the pLysS plasmid) and 50 μg/ml neomycin (to select the Xis plasmid). The culture was incubated at 37 °C until it reached an A600 of 0.5, and then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The culture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4 h, and then cells were pelleted and stored at -20 °C overnight. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 0.8 m KCl) and homogenized with a mortar and pestle. Protease inhibitors were added (50 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg of leupeptin, 50 μg of pepstatin A, 100 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor) along with a one-twentieth volume of lysozyme (10 mg/ml in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was transferred to a 5-ml tube and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then it was divided into four thick walled microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C for 45 min in a Sorvall ultramicrocentrifuge. Supernatants were combined in a new tube, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Supernatants were thawed on ice, and Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) was added at a ratio of 200 μl of washed resin (in binding buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.3 m KCl, 10% glycerol) per 600 μl of supernatant. The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h and then spun at low speed to gently pull down the resin. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of extraction buffer and rotated 30 min at 4 °C. After another wash step, the pellet was resuspended in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.375 m KCl, 10% glycerol) containing 0.2 m imidazole, rotated, and pelleted. Several wash steps with the same buffer containing increasing amounts of imidazole (0.4, 0.6, and 1 m imidazole) were performed, and the imidazole fractions were frozen and stored at -80 °C until use. Each fraction was assayed for purity (Coomassie Blue-stained gel), amount of Xis (Western analysis), and activity (excisive recombination assay). The protein is ∼80% pure.IHF was a gift from S.-W. Yang and H. Nash (National Institutes of Health). Cre protein was a gift from K. Ghosh and G. Van Duyne (University of Pennsylvania), E. coli topoisomerases I and III were gifts from K.

Int, IHF, and Xis were present at 50, 35, and 50 nm final concentration, respectively. During the screening process, peptides were added to a complete excision reaction mix on ice; once all peptides were added, the entire reaction set was moved to room temperature to incubate for 60 min. The final concentrations of peptides are listed for each experiment but typically ranged from 100 μm to 100 pm with at least seven intermediate concentrations. Reactions were stopped with 0.25 volumes of 2% SDS containing xylene cyanol, loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide Tris/SDS gels, and electrophoresed in 1× Tris/Tricine/SDS at 100 mA (9Segall A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24258-24265Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed to an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager screen, visualized and quantitated with ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences.Bent-L recombination reactions were performed as above with the exception of using 1 nm labeled attLtenP′1 (179 bp), 4 nm unlabeled attLtenP′1 (496 bp), and only Int and IHF (7Segall A.M. Nash H.A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 453-463Google Scholar).

Final peptide concentrations tested were 100, 10, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 μm, unless otherwise specified. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, stopped with 0.25 volumes of 2% SDS containing xylene cyanol, and then electrophoresed as above (11Abremski K. Frommer B. Wierzbicki A. Hoess R.H. J. Mol.

Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Google Scholar). Final peptide concentrations tested were 100, 66, 33, and 1 μm. Reactions were incubated 30 min at 37 °C and stopped with 0.25 volumes of stop mix (25% glycerol, 5% SDS, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue). Reactions were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel and electrophoresed at 80 V. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, visualized with a Stratagene Eagle Eye instrument, and quantitated using the Amersham Biosciences program ImageQuant.Vaccinia Topoisomerase Plasmid Relaxation Assay—Reactions were performed in a volume of 10 μl and contained 50 ng of supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA, 25 nm enzyme, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 5 mm MgCl2 (3Casell G.D. Klemm M. Pinilla C. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1193-1202Google Scholar, 13Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Google Scholar). Peptide concentrations tested were 100, 66, 33, and 1 μm. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C and analyzed as the human topoisomerase reactions above.E. coli Topoisomerase I and III Plasmid Relaxation Assays—E. coli Topo I assays were performed in a volume of 20 μl and contained 250 ng of supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA, 25 nm enzyme, 14.6% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 44.5 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 1.1 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) (14Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Google Scholar). Peptide concentrations tested were 100, 66, 33, and 1 μm. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, stopped with 0.25 volumes of 2% SDS containing xylene cyanol and analyzed as the human topoisomerase reactions.E. coli Topo III assays were performed in a volume of 20 μl and contained 200 ng of supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA, 25 nm enzyme, 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8), 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 40% glycerol (15Zhang H.L. Malpure S. Li Z. Hiasa H. DiGate R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9039-9045Google Scholar). Peptides were tested at a concentration of 50 μm. Reactions were incubated at 52 °C for 30 min, and gel loading dye (15% Ficoll, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue) (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was added. Reactions were loaded on a 1% agarose gel and electrophoresed at 60 V, whereas subsequent steps were identical to analysis of human topoisomerase reactions.Restriction Enzyme Assays—Reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl and contained 1× appropriate New England Biolabs reaction buffer, 200 ng of pUC19 supercoiled plasmid DNA, and 10 units of NdeI or HindIII enzyme. Peptide concentrations tested were 100, 75, 50, 25, and 5 μm. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, allowing roughly 50% cleavage of the substrate. Reactions were then separated on agarose gels and visualized as described above for human topoisomerase.Peptides—Peptide libraries were synthesized with a C-terminal amide group using TBOC-protected amino acid residues (17Pinilla C Appel J R. Campbell G.D. Buencamino J Benkirane N. Muller S. Greenspan N.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 1013-1025Google Scholar) at the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies. Peptides of specific sequence, also with a C-terminal amide, were synthesized at Sigma-Genosys using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected l- or d-amino acid residues. The dual defined position peptide libraries and the final peptides were solubilized in 50–100% Me2SO; therefore, we tested the effect of Me2SO on recombination in each pathway and found no effect at the concentrations used: at most 1% and typically much less than 1% (data not shown). WRWYCR and WRWYAR homodimers linked to each other via the α and ϵ NH2 groups of a Lys residue (Lys-dimers) were synthesized and purified at the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies. Peptide structures and purity levels were verified by high pressure liquid chromatography and/or by mass spectrometry.Bismaleimidohexane (BMH)-cross-linked Peptide—WRWYCR was cross-linked with BMH, an irreversible homobifunctional cross-linker reactive to sulfhydryl groups with a 16.1-Å tether separating the maleimide groups (Pierce). Cross-linking reactions were performed, according to the manufacturer's specifications, in a 50-μl volume containing 20 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7), 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmol of WRWYCR, 1.5 mmol of BMH, and 13.6% Me2SO. Reactions were incubated 60 min at room temperature and quenched with β-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 50 mm.Holliday Junction Accumulation and Resolution—Excision Holliday junctions were isolated as described in Ref. 5Cassell G.D. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 413-429Google Scholar, except that excision reactions were performed in the presence of peptide WRWYCR at a final concentration of 0.5 μm to trap the junction intermediates. Typically, 4–8 × 50-μl (2.5×) reactions were necessary to provide sufficient substrate for several experiments. The HJs were isolated by running the reactions on a Tris-SDS-5% polyacrylamide gel (29:1), exposing to film, and excising the appropriate band. The DNA was isolated from the gel using a crush/soak passive elution into Tris-EDTA (10 mm:1 mm) with 0.1% SDS followed by centrifugation through an empty spin column. The DNA was precipitated using ethanol and sodium acetate, resuspended in Tris-EDTA (10 mm:1 mm), and quantitated by A260. The purified HJs were added, at a final concentration of 2 nm, to a reaction identical to that in which they were generated, except that proteins were absent. This reaction is held at 37 °C and initiated by the addition of a mix consisting of (room temperature-prewarmed) Int (50 nm final concentration), IHF (35 nm), and Xis (50 nm). After the indicated time, the reactions were stopped with SDS at a final concentration of 1% and analyzed as described above. Note that if the proteins are preincubated with the substrate at 4 °C, significant resolution (about 6–10% in 5 min) occurs.The Holliday junctions for the “DTT release” assays were formed in normal recombination reactions containing linear attL and attR substrates, Int, IHF, and Xis and peptide WRWYCR at 0.5 μm, as above. After incubating for 45 min to allow the maximum HJs to form, 10 mm DTT (final concentration) was added. The reduced peptides dissociate, allowing the bound Int to resolve the junctions. The addition of DTT is considered t = 0 with respect to junction resolution, and the reactions are stopped at various times and analyzed as above.RESULTSPreviously, our laboratory has identified several hexameric peptide inhibitors potent in the accumulation of Holliday junctions by screening synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries using a positional scanning strategy (3Casell G.D. Klemm M. Pinilla C. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1193-1202Google Scholar). The bent-L pathway was used as the target of the screen, an efficient Int-mediated pathway with relatively simple requirements (Table I) (7Segall A.M. Nash H.A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 453-463Google Scholar). Whereas the original peptides were quite potent in this pathway, their potency was as much as 10–50-fold lower in other Int-mediated pathways (Table II) (4Klemm M. Cheng C. Cassell G. Shuman S. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1203-1216Google Scholar, 5Cassell G.D. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 413-429Google Scholar). We hypothesized that, by rescreening peptide libraries using the excision pathway, we may identify a more potent inhibitor of excision. This has indeed been the case.Table IISummary of peptide inhibitory activities (IC50, μm) Open table in a new tab Peptide Library Screening—To screen for excisive recombination inhibitors that lead to accumulation of pathway intermediates, we used the same positional scanning approach described previously for the identification of inhibitors of Int-mediated recombination (3Casell G.D. Klemm M. Pinilla C. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1193-1202Google Scholar, 17Pinilla C Appel J R. Campbell G.D. Buencamino J Benkirane N. Muller S. Greenspan N.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 1013-1025Google Scholar), illustrated in Fig. 2. The first step involved testing the effect on excision of 20 separate hexapeptide mixtures, each of which has one of the 20 amino acids fixed at one of the six positions and an equimolar mixture of 19 amino acids (all except cysteine) at the other five positions. Each mixture was tested at two concentrations at least twice; the concentrations of the mixtures were 3–10-fold lower than in our previous screen (3Casell G.D. Klemm M. Pinilla C. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1193-1202Google Scholar). In addition, each reaction contained 100 ng of salmon sperm DNA in order to minimize the effect of nonspecific DNA binding by the peptides. The individual peptide mixture was added to an excision reaction, incubated for 60 min, and analyzed on a Tris/Tricine/SDS gel. Holliday junctions accumulated in each reaction were quantitated, and the mixtures were ranked accordingly. This process was repeated with mixtures in which each of the other five positions were fixed in turn. A total of 120 peptide mixtures were tested during the first step (Fig. 2). The most active mixtures were compared with each other in more extensive dose-response assays in order to reduce the number of candidate residues at each position to four or five (residues marked by asterisks in Fig. 3A).Fig. 2Strategy for deconvolution of the synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries. In step 1, one position in the hexapeptide is fixed (denoted by O) with one of the 20 amino acid residues, and the remaining positions (denoted by X) are mixtures of 19 residues (all except cysteine). The same complexity of peptides can be found in libraries used in step 2 of the deconvolution process; these are known as dual defined position libraries, because each hexapeptide contains two fixed positions, whereas the remaining four positions contain one of 19 residues. Because of this, a set of 400 dual defined libraries in which positions 1 and 2 are fixed represent the same complexity as 40 single defined libraries in which either position 1 or position 2 is fixed. However, individual dual defined libraries are much less complex than each single defined library. Instead of testing all possible 1200 dual defined libraries, we tested only those libraries that contained the best candidate residues at each position of the library in step 1. Finally, step 3 entails testing peptides of completely defined sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Results of screening single and dual defined peptide mixtures.A, the effect of single defined peptide libraries on excisive recombination. Recombination reactions were treated with mixtures with a single position defined at the final concentration shown in the figure. The amino acid residue at the fixed position is denoted along the x axis. Values for percentage of HJs in the reaction were calculated as the radioactive counts measured for the junction expressed as a percentage of total counts in the lane. The mixtures chosen for the second step of deconvolution are marked with an asterisk. These mixtures were chosen not only on the basis of the data shown here but also based on the results of dose-response assays with the top six candidate mixtures at each position (the concentrations used for the dose-response assays were between 1 and 0.0003 mg/ml final concentration). On occasion, if two closely related residues (e.g. lysine and arginine) were among the top candidates at a position, only one of these was chosen for the second step to facilitate the inclusion of more unique residues. B, the effect of dual defined peptide libraries on excisive recombination. 8–16 mixtures were tested for each position pair. Shown is the activity of the most potent six mixtures. The final total concentration of peptides added to each reaction is shown. Values for percentage of HJ accumulation were calculated as in A. The minimum and maximum amounts of HJs accumulated from all of the dual defined mixtures tested for each library are indicated under the x axis. The mixtures that were most potent at blocking recombination after dose-response assays and that consequently were chosen for inclusion in final peptides are marked with an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the second screening step, we used dual defined mixtures in which pairs of positions in the hexapeptides were fixed with all combinations of the most effective residues identified in the first step of the deconvolution (Fig. 2). As before, the dual defined mixtures were significantly more inhibitory than the single defined mixtures (3Casell G.D. Klemm M. Pinilla C. Segall A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1193-1202Google Scholar, 17Pinilla C Appel J R. Campbell G.D. Buencamino J Benkirane N. Muller S. Greenspan N.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 1013-1025Google Scholar); the most potent single fixed mixtures accumulated 20–40% junctions at 30 μg/ml final concentration (Fig. 3A), whereas many of the dual defined mixtures accumulated the same amount of junctions at 5 μg/ml final concentration (Fig. 3B). This is most likely due to the higher concentration of individual peptides in the dual defined mixtures. Four hundred mixtures represent all possible combination"
https://openalex.org/W2008345875,"A number of studies have identified a role for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in regulating angiogenesis, although results from these investigations have been controversial. Among key cellular components of an angiogenic vessel are endothelial cells (ECs), which are known to express several components of the fibrinolytic system, including PAI-1. Thus, alterations in expression of this protein may have direct effects on cell functions involved in vascular development. In this study, ECs were isolated from sections of murine arterial trees from wild-type and PAI-1-deficient mice, and low passage (passages 3-4) homogeneous subpopulations of these cells were obtained by immunomagnetic absorption to antibodies against CD105/CD106. The homogeneity of these cells was further assessed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of a number of EC markers. Comparative analyses of EC proliferation (one event associated with angiogenesis) in wild-type and PAI-1-deficient ECs demonstrated enhanced rates of cell growth for PAI-1-deficient cells relative to wild-type cells. Additional studies demonstrated similar levels of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein and enhanced levels of VEGF receptor-1 (Flt-1) mRNA in PAI-1-deficient cells relative to wild-type cells. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that phosphorylation of Akt was also enhanced in PAI-1-deficient cells, implicating VEGF-induced cell signaling alterations in PAI-1-deficient cells, the result of which may contribute to alterations in cell proliferation.

The development of transgenic and targeted gene-altered mice has allowed for the ability to identify and characterize the roles of individual genes in physiological and pathophysiological events. However, although much has been learned utilizing these mice, technological challenges arise due to the small size of the animal and limited tissue availability, which have hampered further cell-based in vitro investigations.

Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2001; 18: 110-113PubMed Google Scholar), aortic smooth muscle cells transfected with PAI-1 antisense RNA resulted in diminished expression of PAI-1 concomitant with a decrease in VEGF expression. This indicates that PAI-1 could potentially regulate, either directly or indirectly, the expression of the pro-angiogenic growth factor (VEGF). Additionally, increases in PAI-1 mRNA have been shown to be localized to cells at the edge of wounded bovine microvascular and aortic ECs and is inhibited by antibodies to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (6Pepper M.S. Sappino A.P. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, PAI-1 has been shown to inhibit bFGF-induced angiogenesis in a chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay (7Stefansson S. Petitclerc E. Wong M.K. McMahon G.A. Brooks P.C. Lawrence D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8135-8141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). One study utilizing adenoviral delivery of two mutant forms of PAI-1 to PAI-1-deficient (PAI-1-/-) mice demonstrated that PAI-1 facilitates tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting proteolytic activity rather than by interacting with vitronectin, indicating that excess plasmin proteolysis prevents the stable assembly of tumor vessels (8Bajou K. Masson V. Gerard R.D. Schmitt P.M. Albert V. Praus M. Lund L.R. Frandsen T.L. Brunner N. Dano K. Fusenig N.E. Weidle U. Carmeliet G. Loskutoff D. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Foidart J.M. Noel A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, other investigations utilizing PAI-1 variants ascribed this activity to both antiprotease and vitronectin binding functions (7Stefansson S. Petitclerc E. Wong M.K. McMahon G.A. Brooks P.C. Lawrence D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8135-8141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in vitro studies utilizing aortic rings from PAI-1-/- mice cultured in collagen or Matrigel demonstrated enhanced capillary sprouting (9Brodsky S. Chen J. Lee A. Akassoglou K.

Therefore, the function of PAI-1 in neovessel formation remains controversial. plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor-1-deficient endothelial cell vascular endothelial growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor basic fibroblast growth factor wild-type phosphate-buffered saline fetal bovine serum bovine serum albumin endothelial cell protein C receptor reverse transcription intercellular adhesion molecule vascular cell adhesion molecule urokinase-type plasminogen activator urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Tris-buffered saline extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. We believed that in vitro studies of specific properties of isolated ECs related to angiogenesis would be valuable in identifying functions of PAI-1 in this process. This work presents a characterization of such cells isolated from wild-type and PAI-1-/- aortas and compares their growth factor-induced proliferative capacities as one step in the angiogenic process. In this study, low passage ECs were isolated from the thoracic aortas of WT and PAI-1-/- mice, and the comparative proliferative properties of these cells and potential mechanisms are described herein. PAI-1-/- mice have been described previously (10Carmeliet P. Kieckens L. Schoonjans L. Ream B. van Nuffelen A. Prendergast G. Cole M. Bronson M.R. Collen D. Mulligan R.C. J. Clin.

WT C57BL/6J (>F8) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were used as controls. All animals were housed in micro-isolation cages on a 12-h light/dark cycle with controlled temperature and humidity and had access to food and water ad libitum. Male mice between 8 and 12 weeks of age were exclusively employed for this work. WT and PAI-1-/- male mice (six mice/genotype/preparation) were anesthetized intraperitoneally with a rodent mixture of 0.015 mg of xylazine, 0.075 mg of ketamine, and 0.0025 mg aceprozamine/g of body weight. An incision was made into the peritoneal cavity and diaphragm. A bilateral thoractomy was then performed to expose the lungs and heart. An incision was made into the right atrium, and the animal was perfused through the left ventricle with sterile saline. The rib cage was then cut at the base of the throat to expose the thymus, which was removed to visualize the aortic arch. Fat was excised from the aortic tree starting at the arch and then working posteriorly. The aortic tree was freed from attachment to the heart, carotids, and subclavian artery and, in the peritoneal cavity, from the kidneys and iliac branch point. The aortic tree was then placed in sterile saline to remove debris and blood and transferred to complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma), 20% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA), 50 μg/ml endothelial growth factor supplement (BD Biosciences), 2 mml-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (100 units of penicillin, 0.1 mg of streptomycin, 0.25 μg of amphotericin B; Sigma), 0.1 mm amino acids (Invitrogen), and 1 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen) and kept on ice until further processing. The initial harvesting of ECs was as described previously (12Kreisel D. Krupnick A.S. Szeto W.Y. Popma S.H. Sankaran D. Krasinskas A.M. Amin K.M. Rosengard B.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 254: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the exception that the cells were maintained on a collagen-coated surface at all times due to the potential effects of plastic and other surfaces on the trans-differentiation of these cells (13Frid M.G. Kale V.A. Stenmark K.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). For the initial plating, a collagen mixture was prepared by the addition of 9 ml of collagen type I rat tail (1 mg/ml; BD Biosciences) to 1 ml of sterile 0.1 n NaOH, 3.5 ml of 3× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 2.25 ml of 1× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. An aliquot of 1 ml was added to each well of a 12-well plate and allowed to gel at 37 °C for 60 min. The gel was then equilibrated overnight with 0.5-1.0 ml of complete medium, and the medium was aspirated from the gel. The aorta was cut into 10 pieces coronally, washed with culture medium, and then opened longitudinally to assure that all blood was removed. Each segment was then positioned lumen side down onto the gel (one segment/well) and placed in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 36 h. One ml of medium was applied per well. After 7-10 days, once visible outgrowth from the tissue was observed, the aortic segment and medium were removed. One ml of a 0.3% solution of collagenase I (Invitrogen) was then added to the attached cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The solution containing the cells was centrifuged, and the cells were reseeded onto a 100-mm collagen-coated plate containing 10 ml of complete medium. When cells were confluent, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Four ml of 0.3% collagenase I was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30-40 min. The cells were then diluted with the medium, centrifuged, and washed with PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A 30-μm pre-separation filter (MACS, Miltenyi Biotech GmbH) was washed three times with the same buffer. The cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 1% FBS and passed through the pre-separation filter to remove clumps. The filter was washed twice. The cells were then centrifuged, and 0.3 ml of biotin-free diluent Fc receptor blocker (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) was added to 106 cells and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS containing 1% FBS. Rat anti-mouse CD105 and CD106 antibodies (10 μg/ml final concentration for both; both from Pharmingen) were added to the cells, and the volume was adjusted to 50 μl with RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were incubated on ice for 1 h, washed first with RPMI 1640 medium and then with PBS/FBS, and resuspended in an equal volume of PBS/FBS and MACS goat anti-rat IgG microbeads (100 μl of bead suspension/107 cells). The cells and beads were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. During the incubation, the MiniMACS separation unit was attached to the MACS multistand, and the MACS separation column was placed in the MiniMACS separation unit. The column was washed twice with 0.5 ml of PBS and 1% FBS. The cells were then washed once with PBS and 1% FBS, resuspended in degassed PBS/FBS, and loaded onto the column. Cells that were positive for CD105 and CD106 were retained on the column, whereas cells that were negative for these two EC markers passed through the column. The column was then removed from the separator, and the cells were flushed using a plunger supplied with the column. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in complete medium, and plated onto 100-mm collagen-coated plates in 10 ml of complete medium. When confluent, cells were released from the collagen matrix by incubation with 0.3% collagenase I and recounted. An aliquot of 1 × 105 cells was transferred to a 1.5-ml amber microcentrifuge tube and washed twice with dye loading buffer containing Hanks' balanced saline solution (Invitrogen), 20 mm Hepes (Sigma), and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma). Cells were stained with 100 μl of 0.5 μm calcein (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark and then washed twice with 1 ml of staining buffer containing PBS, 2% BSA, and 0.05% NaN3 (ACROS Organics, Pittsburgh, PA). The cells were stained with either rat anti-mouse CD105 or CD106 antibody (10 μg/ml) in staining buffer for 1 h on ice. They were then washed twice with staining buffer and labeled with 2 μg/ml Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in 100 μl of staining buffer, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min in the dark. The cells were washed twice with staining buffer and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in cell buffer (cell assay reagents, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). A cell assay LabChip (Agilent Technologies) was primed with priming solution (Agilent Technologies), after which 10 μl of the cell suspension (20,000 cells) was added to one of six channels. A focusing dye was applied to another chamber, which acted as a reference for the optical detection system. The chip was then placed in an Agilent Technologies Model 2100 bioanalyzer, which utilizes a vacuum to move cells, single file, through the microfluidic channels past a fluorescent detector. Fluorescent emission from the cells was detected at 510-540 and 674-696 nm. Typically, 500-1000 events/240 s are recorded. Fluorescent events were plotted against the fluorescent intensity (frequency histogram). A gate was then set on the calcein-positive cells (live cells), and a software program was used to determine the percent positive for the CD markers within the gated calcein-positive cells. Additional confirmation of cell homogeneity was accomplished by manual immunohistochemical analyses. Cells were plated onto collagen-coated Oncyte slides (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in the cell cultures and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Cells were washed and blocked for endogenous biotin, avidin, and peroxidase activities (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Preimmune rabbit serum was used to block nonspecific antibody interactions for CD105 and CD106, and preimmune goat serum was used for the EC protein C receptor (EPCR). Slides were then incubated with primary antibody (rat anti-mouse CD106 or CD105 monoclonal antibody or chicken anti-mouse EPCR polyclonal antibody (generated in-house)) overnight in a humidified chamber at room temperature. After washing, biotinylated secondary antibody against the appropriate primary antibody species was then added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (BioGenex Labs, San Ramon, CA) was added to the slides and incubated for 30 min. Nova Red (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) was used as the chromogen. All immunostained cells were counterstained with hematoxylin QS (Vector Labs, Inc.). The negative control consisted of samples without the addition of primary antibody. To determine percent positive for the marker of interest, three slides were immunostained per marker, and three fields/slide were counted. The percentage of cells positive for the marker from the total cells counted in the field was determined and averaged over the total number of fields. Extraction of RNA—Total RNA was extracted from WT and PAI-1-/- murine ECs in culture using the QIAGEN RNeasy mini-extraction kit. RNA was then treated with DNase I according to the manufacturer's instructions. Design and Construction of Primers/Probes for Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—PCR primers and probes for EPCR, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), VEGF isoforms (VEGF120, VEGF164, and VEGF188), VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), PAI-1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and HPRT were designed using the software Primer Express™ 1.5a and published sequences and were synthesized by MWG Biotech Inc. (Highpoint, NC) and Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA), respectively. PCR amplicons crossed an intron-exon boundary, assuring that they were then specific for cDNA, or amplified a region of the 3′-untranslated region if multiple isoforms of a gene existed, i.e. VEGF. HPRT or GAPDH genes were used as housekeeping genes for purposes of data normalization. The specificity of the primer set was first tested by RT-PCR and melting curve analysis using the ABI SYBR® Green kit and the ABI Prism™ 7700 sequence detector. Subsequently, each PCR product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis; and if a single product of the predicted molecular size was observed, the corresponding probe was then synthesized. Primers were also analyzed in BLAST searches to ensure specificity for the gene of interest. RT-PCR—RT and PCR were carried out using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master hybridization probe kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A coupled RT-PCR was performed using TaqMan chemistry in the Roche LightCycler instrument. The principles of TaqMan PCR have been reported (14Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 100 ng of total RNA, 2 μl of 10× Master mixture (dNTP mixture with dUTP instead of dTTP), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 nm each primer, 100 nm probe, 16 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), 2 units of Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems Inc.), and diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to a final volume of 20 μl. Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 48 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min, with fluorescent readings at the end of each cycle. The amount of mRNA detected was quantitated against individual standard curves. All samples were run in triplicate. Normalization of TaqMan PCR Results—The housekeeping genes HPRT and GAPDH were used to normalize input RNA for each reaction. The results were extrapolated from standard curves and are expressed as a ratio of the total RNA of the gene of interest to that of HPRT or GAPDH ± S.E. RT-PCR results for VEGF transcripts were validated by detection of VEGF protein in cell culture media collected from plates and passed through a 0.22-μm filter prior to RNA extraction. The Quantikine® M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used, and the assay was performed in triplicate. The results were compared with a standard curve utilizing murine recombinant VEGF (7.8-500 pg/ml). An aliquot of 2 × 103 ECs suspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium was plated onto collagen (1 mg/ml)-coated multiwell chambered coverslips (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The next day, the medium was removed, and the cells were gently washed with complete medium without EC growth supplement. At various times (0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h), the cells were rinsed twice with 1× PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, followed by two rinses with PBS. The cells were treated with Peroxoblock (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 45 s to quench endogenous peroxidase activity and then permeabilized by treating cells with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and 0.1% Triton for 30 min. Cells were washed and treated with normal swine serum (diluted 1:5 in TBS/BSA; Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody interactions. The cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt primary antibody (diluted 1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) or primary antibody treated with a phospho-Ser473 Akt-blocking peptide (Cell Signaling Technology) as a control for specificity of the antibody/antigen interaction. The cells were incubated overnight at room temperature in a humidified chamber. The cells were then washed three times for 5 min and treated with swine anti-rabbit biotin F(ab)2 IgG (diluted 1:500 in TBS/BSA) for 30 min. The cells were washed three times for 5 min and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (diluted 1:50) for 30 min. After washing three times for 5 min, the chromogen Nova Red was used to visualize positive antibody interactions. The cells were then washed three times for 5 min. For counterstaining, the cells were rinsed six times with double-distilled water and stained with hematoxylin QS for 30 s and then rinsed six times with double-distilled water. The cells were allowed to dry overnight at room temperature and coverslipped with permanent mounting medium. The SP5.2 peptide (NGYEIEWYSWVTHGMY) was synthesized using a standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protocol and purified from crude product by high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column using 22-50% water/acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for 40 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The mass of the peptide (2035 Da) was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry using the micromass Quattro LC (University of Notre Dame Mass Spectrometry Facility). Cells at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h during proliferation were washed with PBS and then harvested from the collagen-coated plates with collagenase. For some studies, the SP5.2 peptide (10 μm final concentration), which blocks VEGF/Flt-1 interaction and downstream effects (15El-Mousawi M. Tchistiakova L. Yurchenko L. Pietrzynski G. Moreno M. Stanimirovic D. Ahmad D. Alakhov V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46681-46691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), was added to the medium at 48 h, and cells were then collected 24 h later. The cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Igepal CA-630, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaF, 200 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 20 min at 4 °C, and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by the micro-BCA protein assay (Pierce), and 50 μg of total protein was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The protein was then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Osmonics, Inc., Minnetonka, MN) and washed with TBS at room temperature for 5 min. The membrane was then incubated in blocking buffer (TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat milk powder) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with either rabbit anti-Akt primary antibody or rabbit anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt antibody, both of which were previously diluted 1:1000 times in buffer containing 1× TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% BSA. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation and washed three times for 5 min with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. It was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer for 1 h with gentle agitation. After this, the membrane was washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 5 min, and the proteins were detected using the Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were then exposed to x-ray film and developed. As controls, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Akt extracts (Cell Signaling Technology) were used. Prestained broad-range molecular markers (Bio-Rad) were also used to determine the molecular mass of the Akt protein. For densitometric analyses of Akt, Bioquant NOVA software (Version 4.00.8, R & M Biometrics, Inc., Nashville, TN) was used to measure the density of the signals in the autoradiograms. Integrated optical densities were calculated using the green channel after background correction was applied. Cell proliferation was measured by manual counts. Cells were resuspended at 2 × 104 cells/ml in complete medium with EC growth factor supplement. An aliquot of 1 ml was added to collagen-coated 24-well plates. The cells were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. After this time, the medium was removed, and fresh complete medium without EC growth factor supplement (±5 ng/ml human recombinant bFGF (BD Biosciences) or 10 ng/ml human recombinant VEGF (Antigenix America, Inc., Huntington Station, NY)) was added to the adherent cells. The plates were then incubated for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Manual cell counts were performed at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. For this, the medium was removed, and the wells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then stained with hematoxylin. The cells were viewed with a Nikon E600 microscope, and images were recorded. Cell counts were performed in triplicate/time point/genotype (three fields/well) utilizing the Bioquant Nova software program. Data are expressed as average number of cells/field ± S.E. Two separate batches of EC preparations/genotype were analyzed. Isolation of Aortic ECs and Confirmation of Homogeneity—Six aortic trees were processed per batch of EC preparation. After the initial plating of cells onto 100-mm plates, where one plate represents one aortic tree, typically 20 × 106 cells were collected per six aortic trees prior to purification on the immunomagnetic beads. After purification, ∼10% of the cells were recovered and were positive for CD105 and CD106. They were then replated onto 100-mm plates at an initial cell density of 0.5 × 106 cells/plate. Utilizing Agilent technology to confirm homogeneity of the cell population and antibodies to CD105 and CD106, >3000 fluorescent events were recorded. Fluorescent events were plotted against the fluorescent intensity and graphed as a frequency histogram (Fig. 1). A gate was then set on the calcein-positive cells (live cells), and the percent positive for the CD markers indicated that >95% were positive for CD105 (Fig. 1, a and b) and CD106 (Fig. 1, c and d). A negative control study (no primary antibody) was performed to confirm specificity (Fig. 1e). The purity of the cells was further confirmed by manual immunohistochemistry with cells"
https://openalex.org/W1971263689,"The crystalline bacterial cell surface layer (S-layer) protein SbsB of Geobacillus stearothermophilus PV72/p2 was dissected into an N-terminal part defined by the three consecutive S-layer homologous motifs and the remaining large C-terminal part.

Evidence for functional and structural integrity of the two truncated forms was provided by optical spectroscopic methods and electron microscopy. In particular, binding of the secondary cell wall polymer revealed a high affinity dissociation constant of 3 nm and could be assigned solely to the soluble rSbsB1–178, whereas rSbsB177–889 self-assembled into the same lattice as the full-length protein. Furthermore, thermal as well as guanidinium hydrochloride induced equilibrium unfolding profiles monitored by intrinsic fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy allowed characterization of rSbsB1–178 as an α-helical protein with a single cooperative unfolding transition yielding a ΔG value of 26.5 kJ mol–1. The C-terminal rSbsB177–889 could be characterized as a β-sheet protein with typical multidomain unfolding, which is partially less stable as stand-alone protein.

Recently, SbsB has been used to generate chimeric S-layer proteins by fusion of SbsB with streptavidin either on the N-terminal or on the C-terminal end of SbsB (12Moll D. Huber C. Schlegel B. Pum D.

These chimeric S-layer proteins combine both the ability to form monomolecular protein lattices on different surfaces and the binding of biotinylated compounds. Such a functional biomolecular matrix with repetitive features in the subnanometer range allows a unique approach for immobilizing compounds with defined spacing on a surface. surface layer(s) fluorescein-labeled SCWP Gibbs free energy of protein unfolding guanidinium hydrochloride change in free energy with respect to the change in GdmHCl concentration secondary (accessory) cell wall polymer S-layer homologous motif. The second feature of S-layer proteins is their specific anchoring to the cell wall, which has frequently been assigned to S-layer homologous (SLH) motifs. SLH motifs (13Lupas A. Engelhardt H. Peters J. Santarius U. Volker S. Baumeister W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1224-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) consist of a conserved sequence of 50–60 amino acids and are found in triplicate at the N terminus of many S-layer proteins (10Kuen B.

They have also been identified at the C-terminal end of cell-associated exoenzymes and other exoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria (20Matuschek M. Burchhardt G. Sahm K. Bahl H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3295-3302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where they occur in single copies. SbsB possesses three N-terminal SLH motifs that recognize a secondary (accessory) cell wall polymer (SCWP) in the rigid cell wall as specific binding partner (21Ries W. Hotzy C. Schocher I. Sleytr U.B. Sára M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3892-3898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sára M. Dekitsch C. Mayer H.F. Egelseer E.M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4146-4153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This glycan is mainly composed of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmannosamine in a molar ratio of 2:1 and contains pyruvic acid residues (22Sára M. Dekitsch C. Mayer H.F. Egelseer E.M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4146-4153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their high physiological expense (S-layer protein synthesis can occupy up to 15% of the whole capacity in protein synthesis of the cell (23Sleytr U.B. Messner P. Pum D. Sára M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) and the widespread occurrence in all major phylogenetic groups of bacteria, no structural model at atomic resolution of any S-layer protein is available. This fact may be explained by the molecular mass of the subunits being too large for NMR analysis and by their high tendency to form two-dimensional lattices preventing the formation of isotropic three-dimensional crystals required for x-ray crystallography. In addition, the very low solubility of isolated subunits is a general hindrance for both methods. Attempts like sequence-structure alignment are hindered by the absence of significant sequence similarities to proteins with known structure (1Sára M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 24Engelhardt H. Peters J. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 276-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, even recognition of further domains other than those formed by SLH motifs remains problematic. According to their molecular mass ranging from 40 to 200 kDa S-layer proteins are large multidomain proteins. Thus, direct determination of domain properties is not only more challenging than for small proteins, but often impossible for wild-type proteins. In the present study, the “dissection approach,” frequently applied to cytoskeleton proteins, e.g. titin (25Pfuhl M. Improta S. Politous A.S. Pastore A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 242-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Joseph C. Stier G. O'Brien R. Politou A.S. Atkinson R.A. Bianco A. Ladbury J.E. Martin S.R. Pastore A.

Biol. 2002; 315: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), was applied to an S-layer protein. The aim of the study was to dissect the multidomain protein SbsB into its two functional domains, one binding the SCWP and the other one comprising the self-assembly ability. The maintenance of function and structure of the isolated domains was monitored by means of electron microscopy, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy, which furthermore allowed a characterization of properties of the isolated parts compared with their properties in the context with the wild-type protein. This work is considered as a first step toward resolving the three-dimensional structure of an S-layer protein. Materials—Ultrapure GdmHCl (AA grade) was obtained from Nigu (Waldkraiburg, Germany), and concentrations of GdmHCl solutions were calculated from refractive index measurements (28Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Plasmid Construction, Protein Production and Purification—The plasmids for gene expression were cloned by inserting PCR fragments of sbsB (10Kuen B. Koch A. Asenbauer E. Sára M. Lubitz W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were generated with Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), into the vector pET-28a(+) (Novagen). The template DNA for PCR was chromosomal DNA of G. stearothermophilus PV72/p2, which was prepared from biomass grown in continuous culture (11Sára M. Kuen B. Mayer H.F. Mandl F. Schuster K.C. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2108-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) using a genomic DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). The gene fragments for production of mature full-length SbsB (rSbsB1–889) and N-terminally truncated SbsB (rSbsB177–889) were amplified using the primer pairs F2/R1 and F3/R1, respectively, and inserted into the NcoI and BamHI sites of pET-28a(+). For production of the SLH domain (rSbsB1–178), a gene fragment was amplified with the primer pair F2/R3SLH and inserted into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET-28a(+). PCRs and cloning steps were performed according to standard procedures (29Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Escherichia coli TG1 was used as a cloning host and transformed by electroporation. The following oligonucleotides were used as PCR primers (restriction sites are italicized, start and reverse complementary stop codons are underlined, and complementary regions are bold): F2, 5′-CGGAATTCCATGGCAAGCTTCACAGATGTTGC-3′; F3, 5′-CGGAATTCCATGGAAGTAACTGCGGTTAATTCG-3′; R1, 5′-GCGCGGATCCTTATTTTGTCACAGTCACATTGAC-3′; R3SLH, 5′-GACCGCTCGAGTTATACTTCAACTATTTCTGGCACTG-3′. E. coli HMS174(DE3) carrying an expression vector was used as a host for sbsB gene fragment expression. Protein production and purification were performed as described previously (30Jarosch M. Egelseer E.M. Huber C. Moll D. Mattanovich D. Sleytr U.B. Sára M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1353-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For spectroscopic measurements protein solutions were prepared by dissolving 1 mg of lyophilized protein in 1 ml of 8 m GdmHCl and subsequent dialysis in a dialysis membrane (Biomol, cut-off: 12–16 kDa) against aqua purificata at 4 °C. Dialysis was stopped after 1 h because the refractive index difference between the protein solution and water was smaller than 0.001, indicating a residual GdmHCl concentration below 10 mm. After removing self-assembly products by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was diluted immediately to the desired protein concentration to prevent further formation of self-assembly products. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel (31Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar) in the presence of 8 m GdmHCl. Deviations of the calculated concentrations from values of gravimetrically prepared solutions of lyophilized protein in GdmHCl were smaller than 5%. Production of Fluorescently Labeled SCWP—SCWP was isolated as described previously (21Ries W. Hotzy C. Schocher I. Sleytr U.B. Sára M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3892-3898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of fluorescein labeled SCWP (F-SCWP) was performed using the aldehyde group of SCWP, which was converted into a hydrazone by heating in a saturated solution of carbodihydrazide. After reduction of the hydrazone with sodium borohydride and subsequent dialysis against distilled water, fluorescein isothiocyanate in dimethyl sulfoxide was added slowly under protection of light. After incubation for 3 h at room temperature with continuous stirring, unreacted labeling reagent was removed by extensive dialysis. The degree of labeling was determined by comparing the concentration of total SCWP obtained from the binding isotherm with the concentration of attached fluorescein determined from the absorbance at 490 nm. Because there is only one aldehyde group per SCWP molecule the ratio of labeled SCWP to unlabeled SCWP was calculated to be 1:50. Fluorescence Anisotropy Binding Assays—This equilibrium assay is based on changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of a fluorescently labeled ligand upon binding by a macromolecule (32Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33LeTilly V. Royer C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7753-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Ozers M.S. Hill J.J. Ervin K. Wood J.R. Nardulli A.M. Royer C.A. Gorski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30405-30411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer thermostated at 25 °C employing a 10- × 10-mm quartz cell with a magnetic stirrer. The excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength were selected with double-grating monochromators using a 15-nm band path for high intensity. The excitation wavelength was set at 490 nm, the maximum of fluorescein absorption, and the emission was monitored at 525 nm. Scattered excitation light was suppressed in the emission channel with a 515-nm long pass filter. Solutions of F-SCWP were diluted to the desired concentration of 40 nm using a buffer containing HEPES (10 mm, pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20 to reduce unspecific aggregation and adsorption. Aliquots of protein solutions with concentrations typically between 10 and 20 μm were added successively and stirred gently. The protein concentration in the cuvette was corrected for the slight dilution of protein because of added aliquots. Reported anisotropy values are the mean values of nine separate measurements with a standard deviation of 0.002 or less. Because quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of F-SCWP remained unchanged within the error limits of measurements upon binding, the measured anisotropy values A could be considered as a sum of the anisotropies of free and bound F-SCWP, AC and ACP, weighted by their molar fractions (Equation 1)A=αAC+(1-α)ACP(Eq. 1) Binding isotherms were analyzed by a single step binding model, whose analytical formula (32Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (Equation 2) was used for fitting of the data by means of Marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithms (Origin, Microcal). Parameters of the fit were AC and ACP and the dissociation constant Kd.A=AC+(ACP-AC)(CT+PT+1/Kd)-(CT+PT+1/Kd)1-4·CT·PT2·CT(Eq. 2) The total concentration of F-SCWP CT and the total concentration of protein PT, were set as constants. Investigation of the Self-assembly Properties by Electron Microscopy— For preparation of self-assembly products, 2 mg of lyophilized rSbsB1–889 or rSbsB177–889 was dissolved in 8 m GdmHCl in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.2), and the solution was dialyzed against 10 mm CaCl2 in aqua purificata at 4 °C for 12 h and against aqua purificata for 24 h. For negative staining, 20 μl of the suspensions were incubated with glow-discharged, Formvar-coated copper grids for 15 min at room temperature. After that, fixation with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Pierce) in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 20 min was done. Then the grids were washed at least five times with aqua purificata and incubated with uranylacetate (2% in aqua purificata) for 10 min at room temperature. After drying on a filter paper, the grids were investigated in a Philips CM 100 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV using a 30-μm objective aperture. The lattice orientation was confirmed by Fourier processing (12Moll D. Huber C. Schlegel B. Pum D. Sleytr U.B. Sára M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Proof of Complete Absence of Any Interaction between rSbsB1–178 and rSbsB177–889—To show that rSbsB1–178 and rSbsB177–889 do not associate to form the complete S-layer protein SbsB when they are denaturated and renaturated together, rSbsB1–178 and rSbsB177–889 were dissolved at a concentration of 10 μm each in 8 m GHCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.2) and dialyzed at 4 °C against 10 mm CaCl2 for 12 h and against aqua purificata for 24 h. Then the dialysate was separated into pellet and supernatant by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with a 15% gel. Secondary Structure Prediction—Far-UV CD spectra were measured in the range from 190 to 260 nm at 0.2-nm intervals in a cuvette with an optical path length of 2 mm at 25 °C using an Applied Photophysics Pistar-180 spectropolarimeter. Protein solutions were prepared immediately after centrifugation as described above by dilution to 0.04–0.08 mg ml–1 to prevent any formation of scattering self-assembly products. Buffer base lines were measured under identical conditions and subtracted from the spectra. Predictions of protein secondary structures based on far-UV CD data were performed using the neural net program CDNN (35Böhm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) and the algorithms SELCON, CDSSTR, and CONTIN, which were accessed through the DichroWeb website (36Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Predictions of protein secondary structures based upon primary sequence data were obtained from the Network Protein Sequence analysis tool (37Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) using the algorithm GORIV. GdmHCl Unfolding Experiments—Protein samples prepared as described above were diluted at least 10-fold for spectroscopic measurements adding buffer solutions containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and the indicated concentration of GdmHCl. Reversibility of unfolding was tested using an equilibrated protein sample with a high concentration of GdmHCl, which was diluted to 1/10 of the original denaturant concentration. The spectroscopic properties of the diluted sample were compared with a protein sample prepared from the native state at the same diluted GdmHCl concentration. Denaturation curves were obtained by two different methods: First, samples with fixed mixtures of protein in buffer and GdmHCl were measured. Sample solutions were prepared at least 4 h before measurements. There were neither time-dependent changes in fluorescence intensity after 1 min of sample preparation nor detectable differences in measurements taken at 4 and 24 h. Second, titrations were performed either on a sample of native protein in buffer that was mixed stepwise with a sample of the same protein concentration but containing 8 m GdmHCl or vice versa. After each addition of denaturated protein the same volume of the mixed solution was removed and used for determination of GdmHCl concentration by refractive index measurements. The concentration steps were spaced at 0.15 m GdmHCl intervals in the range from 0.2 to 7 m. Fluorescence emission was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer in a 10- × 10-mm quartz cell after a 1-min setting that allowed the protein solution to come to chemical equilibration after each change in denaturant concentration. The protein concentration was 1 μm, with an absorbance lower than 0.05 at the excitation wavelengths. The samples were excited at 275 nm and 295 nm, and emission was measured from 285 (or 305) to 450 nm at 0.5-nm intervals. The band widths of the excitation and emission monochromator were both set at 5 nm. Each spectrum was corrected by subtraction of the corresponding blank sample obtained by a second titration without protein. Far-UV CD spectra were taken alternating with fluorescence emission measurements on the same sample solutions in the 10-mm quartz cell using both methods of sample preparation as described above. Because of the strong absorption of GdmHCl, far-UV spectra were recorded only for wavelengths longer than 217 nm by averaging three wavelength scans, each obtained by signal averaging for 2.5 s at intervals of 0.2 nm. For an accurate determination of the molar ellipticity at 222 nm, an additional measurement at 222 nm with 30-s integration time was performed. Appropriate blank spectra were recorded on the buffer components and subtracted from spectra obtained on protein solutions. Models of Unfolding—Spectroscopic data obtained in unfolding experiments were analyzed by a simple two-state model (N ↔ U) (38Eftink M.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 482-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) considering the native protein (N) and the unfolded species (U) as described by Equation 3.F=FN+sN[D]+(FU+sU[D])·e(-ΔGun+m[D])/RT1+e(-ΔGun+m[D])/RT(Eq. 3) Equation 3, which includes base-line slopes, was used for determination of ΔGun, the Gibbs free energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, and m, the rate of change in free energy with respect to denaturant concentration. FN and FU are the fluorescence intensities of the native and unfolded states in the absence of denaturant, sN and sU are the base-line slopes for the native and unfolded regions, respectively, and D is the concentration of denaturant. Fitting procedures were performed by the Marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithm using the program Origin (Microcal). The second scheme for unfolding includes an intermediate species (N ↔ I ↔ U) and is given by Equation 4,F=FN+sN[D]+(FI+sI[D])·e(-ΔG1+m1[D])/RT+(FU+sU[D])·e(-ΔG1+m1[D])/RT·e(-ΔG2+m2[D])/RT1+e(-ΔG1+m1[D])/RT+e(-ΔG1+m1[D])/RT·e(-ΔG2+m2[D])/RT(Eq. 4) with the additional terms ΔG1, ΔG2, m1, and m2 for the free energies and m values for the N ↔ I and I ↔ U transitions, respectively. The denaturant concentration at the transition midpoint ci is defined by the respective ratio of ΔGi to mi. An analogous scheme including two intermediate species was used as a four-state model. Thermal Stability Studies by Far-UV CD Spectroscopy—Thermally induced protein denaturation was monitored by far-UV CD spectroscopy. Protein concentrations used were 0.5 μm in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). A quartz cuvette with 2-mm path length was placed into a Peltier controlled sample holder unit. Full spectra were recorded from 190 to 260 nm at 1-nm intervals and for 2 °C increments with a heating rate of 1 °C/min. Additionally, temperature profiles at the fixed wavelengths 206 and 222 nm were recorded for 1 °C increments in a cuvette with 10-mm path length. In any case a temperature probe connected to the cuvette was used to provide an accurate temperature record. The unfolding curves were analyzed using a sigmoidal curve function according to Meyer et al. (39Meyer J.D. Hanagan A. Manning M.C. Catalano C.E. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 23: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Equation 5),θT=[(mD*T-bD)-(mN*T-bN)1+(TTm)mT+mN*T-bN](Eq. 5) where θT is the ellipticity at temperature T, mT the slope of the curve within the transition region, and the inflection point of the curve the melting temperature Tm. At each temperature θN and θD can be extrapolated from the pre- and post-transition baselines, (mN*T – bN) and (mD*T – bD), respectively. Both the genes encoding the three SLH motifs (rSbsB1–178) and the SLH-truncated part (rSbsB177–889) were expressed as isolated recombinant proteins and compared with the mature full-length protein SbsB (residues 1–889), termed rSbsB. The design of these truncated forms was based on a domain boundary as determined by sequence analysis. Because SLH motifs have a conserved sequence of about 55 residues (13Lupas A. Engelhardt H. Peters J. Santarius U. Volker S. Baumeister W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1224-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the boundary between the SLH part (amino acid residues 1–178) and the large SLH-truncated part (residues 177–889) was considered as being defined by the end of the three consecutive SLH motifs (residue range 3–61, 62–119, 120–178) at the N terminus (Fig. 1). Comparison of Binding to SCWP by Fluorescence Anisotropy—The SCWP binding activity was investigated in solution by a fluorescence-based binding assay to characterize quantitatively the interaction between the protein and its target carbohydrate polymer. F-SCWP was employed as ligand and its binding affinity to rSbsB, the two truncated forms and an equimolar mixture of them was studied. Fig. 2 shows a compilation of anisotropy-based binding isotherms of F-SCWP with rSbsB1–178, rSbsB177–889, an equimolar mixture of the former ones, and full-length rSbsB at 25 °C. For both rSbsB and rSbsB1–178, an increase in anisotropy could be observed resulting from complex formation, which was in contrast to the SLH-truncated rSbsB177–889, which did not bind at all. The anisotropy profiles for rSbsB and rSbsB1–178 upon binding to F-SCWP were characterized by an initial plateau for the unbound F-SCWP followed by an anisotropy increase over a range of approximately 2 orders of magnitude in concentration, which is typical of binding in a 1:1 stoichiometry. A plateau for saturated binding concluded this increase. Because of the lower molecular mass compared with rSb"

Wnt signals are transduced by seven-transmembrane Frizzleds (Fzs) and the single transmembrane low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 or 6. In the course of the analysis of genes regulated by bone morphogenetic protein 2 in mesenchymal cells we found a significant induction of murine Frizzled-1 (mFz1) gene expression. Unexpectedly overexpression of mFz1 dramatically repressed the induction of alkaline phosphatase mediated by either bone morphogenetic protein 2 or Wnt3a in these cells. Moreover mFz1 overexpression significantly repressed both β-catenin translocation into the nucleus and T cell factor signaling mediated by Wnt3a. Importantly microinjection of mFz1 transcript in Xenopus embryo inhibited the ability of Wnt1 to induce the expression of the Wnt/β-catenin target gene Siamois in animal cap assay and secondary axis formation in whole embryo. By using chimeric constructs in which N- and C-terminal segments of mFz1 were replaced by the corresponding parts of Xfz3 we demonstrated that the antagonistic activity resides in the cysteine-rich domain of the N-terminal part. The antagonist activity of mFz1 could be prevented by overexpression of Gαq-(305-359), which specifically uncouples Gq-coupled receptors, suggesting that Gαq signaling contributes to the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathway by mFz1. This is the first time that a Frizzled receptor has been reported to antagonize Wnt/β-catenin. Activation of the Wnt signaling cascade provides key signals during development and in disease.

By using chimeric constructs in which N- and C-terminal segments of mFz1 were replaced by the corresponding parts of Xfz3 we demonstrated that the antagonistic activity resides in the cysteine-rich domain of the N-terminal part. The antagonist activity of mFz1 could be prevented by overexpression of Gαq-(305-359), which specifically uncouples Gq-coupled receptors, suggesting that Gαq signaling contributes to the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathway by mFz1. This is the first time that a Frizzled receptor has been reported to antagonize Wnt/β-catenin.

Among members of this family, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been shown to regulate growth and differentiation of chondroblast and osteoblast lineage cells and induce the commitment of mesenchymal cells into osteoblast/chondroblast phenotypes (1Atkinson B.L.

In a series of murine cell lines including C3H10T1/2, C2C12, and ST2, BMP-2 induces the expression of several osteoblast differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (6Spinella-Jaegle S. Rawadi G. Kawai S. Gallea S. Faucheu C. Mollat P. Courtois B. Bergaud B. Ramez V. Blanchet A.M. Adelmant G. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, TGF-β1 has been shown to repress the expression of osteoblast markers, and it abolishes the increase in osteocalcin induced by calcitriol (7Ingram R.T. Bonde S.K. Riggs B.L.

Wnts are secreted proteins involved in a wide range of developmental processes such as embryonic axis specification and organogenesis (10Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). They have been shown to activate distinct pathways both in vertebrates and in invertebrates. The better described pathway is the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In this pathway, the interaction between Wnt and Frizzled receptors leads to inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Genetic epistasis experiments suggest that Dishevelled lies upstream and represses the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3β. As a consequence, β-catenin is stabilized in the cytoplasm and then forms a complex with TCF/lymphocyte enhancer factor to activate transcription of target genes. Frizzled proteins have been shown to function as Wnt receptors (11Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar), and they constitute a large family of seven-transmembrane receptors with at least 10 members in mammals (12Wang Y. Macke J.P.

All Frizzled receptors have a conserved extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) followed by seven putative transmembrane segments. Their cytoplasmic regions differ in length and sequence. Functional analyses in Drosophila and Xenopus embryos indicate that Frizzled proteins have distinct functions in Wnt/β-catenin signaling (13Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). More recently, members of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) family have been shown to be co-receptors for Wnt ligands (14Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C.

The two closely related proteins LRP5 and LRP6 are single pass transmembrane receptors and associate with Frizzled receptors in a Wnt-dependent manner. There is an increasing body of evidence showing that Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an essential role during osteoblast differentiation. Deletion of LRP6 gene in mice results in embryos with spina bifida, absence of tail, and malformed fore and hind limbs. The skeleton of the neonate also shows truncation of the axial skeleton and loss of distal dorsal limb structures (16Pinson K.I. Brennan J. Monkley S. Avery B.J. Skarnes W.C. Nature. 2000; 407: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). More importantly, mice deficient in LRP5 exhibit decreased osteoblast proliferation and osteopenia (19Kato M. Patel M.S. Levasseur R. Lobov I. Chang B.H. Glass II, D.A. Hartmann C. Li L. Hwang T.H. Brayton C.F. Lang R.A. Karsenty G. Chan L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Furthermore mutations resulting in a loss of function of LRP5 in humans lead to osteopenia (20Gong Y. Slee R.B. Fukai N. Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Reginato A.M. Wang H. Cundy T. Glorieux F.H. Lev D.

These results clearly suggest a genetic link between LRP5, and consequently Wnt, signaling and the regeneration of bone mass. The control of osteoblast differentiation involves a complex combination of signals. However, the relationship and possible cross-talk between different signaling pathways and/or different components of these pathways remain largely unknown. In this study we report that BMP-2 up-regulates the expression of Frizzled-1 in different murine mesenchymal cell lines. Unexpectedly overexpression of Frizzled-1 counteracts the effects of BMP-2 and Wnt3a in inducing the expression of the osteoblast differentiation marker ALP, indicating that mouse Frizzled-1 (mFz1) may exert a feedback mechanism to modulate the effect of BMP-2 in murine mesenchymal cells. More importantly we have demonstrated, using a Xenopus assay, that mFz1 is capable of antagonizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our data suggest that the CRD of mFz1 may be responsible for its inhibitory function. Whether mFz1 antagonizes Wnt signaling by competing with other members of the Frizzled family or with Wnt binding for LRP5 association or by both mechanisms remains to be determined. Cell Culture—C2C12 cells, kindly provided by Dr. G. Karsenty (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), and ST-2, C3H10T1/2, COS-7 and L-Wnt3a cells, obtained from ATCC, were maintained (5% CO2 at 37 °C) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum at appropriate concentration. RNA Extraction, Chip Hybridizations, and Quantitative RT-PCR— Total RNA samples were obtained from three C2C12 cell cultures (BMP-2-treated, 1 μg/ml; TGF-β-treated, 2.5 ng/ml; and solvent-treated control, 10 mm HCl) by use of the RNAplus kit provided by Quantum, harvesting from each culture at six time points (4 h, 8 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, and 4 days). Total RNA was also extracted from ST-2 and C3H10T1/2 cells under similar conditions. Total RNA samples from C2C12 cells were hybridized to the complete series of Affymetrix 35,000 mouse chips as described by Theilhaber et al. (23Theilhaber J. Connolly T. Roman-Roman S. Bushnell S. Jackson A. Call K. Garcia T. Baron R. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and data assembly and analysis were carried as described by the authors (23Theilhaber J. Connolly T. Roman-Roman S. Bushnell S. Jackson A. Call K. Garcia T. Baron R. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with TaqMan PCR reagent kits in the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) as described by Spinella-Jaegle et al. (6Spinella-Jaegle S. Rawadi G. Kawai S. Gallea S. Faucheu C. Mollat P. Courtois B. Bergaud B. Ramez V. Blanchet A.M. Adelmant G. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following (5′-3′) primer/probe set was designed using Primer-Express Version 1.0 software from Applied Biosystems: forward, 5′-GCCTACATCGCTGGCTTTCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCCGTCCTCTGCAAACTT-3′; probe, 5′-AGGACCGGGTGGTGTGCAACGA-3′. Wnt3a-conditioned Medium Preparation—Wnt3a-conditioned medium (Wnt3a-CM) was prepared as described by Shibamoto et al. (24Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, to collect the conditioned medium from cultures of Wnt3a-producing L cells, these cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 106 cells in a 125-cm2 flask containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h after seeding, medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal calf serum, and cells were cultured for 3 days. Then Wnt3a-CM was harvested, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane. The activity of Wnt3a-CM was assayed on normal L cells by examining the increase in β-catenin as described by Willert et al. (25Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Wnt3a-CM was added to cells at 20% final concentration in all subsequent experiments. Measurement of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—C2C12 cells were plated at 2 × 104/cm2 and 24 h later were transfected with the indicated constructs (1 μg total) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 16 h after transfection, cells were washed and cultured in media containing 2% fetal bovine serum. When indicated, cells were treated with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) (6Spinella-Jaegle S. Rawadi G. Kawai S. Gallea S. Faucheu C. Mollat P. Courtois B. Bergaud B. Ramez V. Blanchet A.M. Adelmant G. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with Wnt3a-CM. 48 h later, ALP activity was determined in cell lysates using the alkaline phosphatase Opt kit (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were analyzed for protein content using the micro-BCA assay kit (Pierce), and ALP activity was normalized for total protein concentration. Luciferase Assay—COS-7 cells plated in 24-well plates at 2 × 104/cm2 were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs (1 μg total) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 20 ng of pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI), which encodes a Renilla luciferase gene downstream of a minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, was systematically added to the transfection mixture to assess transfection efficiency. When required, controls were carried out by replacing constructs with corresponding empty vectors. 16 h after transfection, cells were washed and cultured in media containing 2% fetal bovine serum for an additional 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase assays were performed with the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μl of cell lysate were assayed first for firefly luciferase and then for Renilla luciferase activity. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Plasmids and Constructs—mFz1 and human Frizzled-1 (hFz1) were amplified by RT-PCR, and the nucleotide sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis and subcloned with a Myc tag into pcDNA3.1 vector and into pTracer to co-express GFP protein (Invitrogen). Murine TCF expressing vector and the TCF-luciferase reporter construct, TOP-flash (26van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A.

Human β-catenin was RT-PCR amplified, confirmed by sequencing, and subcloned into pcDNA3.1. QuikChange was used to create a constitutive active mutant form of β-catenin (β-catenin*) with the S33Y missense mutation (27Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B.

Myc-tagged Xenopus Frizzled-3 (Xfz3) was described previously (29Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Xenopus Wnt1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR and subcloned in pCS2 vector (30Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). mFz1 was obtained by PCR amplification of mFz1 CRD and the downstream sequence with sense primer 5′-ATCTCCATGGCGGACCACGGCTAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-AGTTCTAGACGGTAGTCTCCCCCT-3′ including a NcoI and XbaI site, respectively. mFz1 amplicon was cloned into pCS2 vector in-frame with the signal peptide and Myc epitopes using convenient restriction sites. Derived truncated or chimera constructs were also cloned in the same vector using convenient restriction sites in-frame with the signal peptide and Myc epitopes. mFz1 was also cloned in the same vector using convenient restriction sites. The Myc-tagged mFz1ΔC that retains seven residues after the seventh transmembrane domain was obtained by digesting the full-length mFz1 with NcoI and EcoRI. mFz1ΔN lacking the CRD was obtained by PCR amplification of the seven transmembrane and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains using a sense and an antisense primer including a NcoI and a XbaI sites (underlined), respectively: 5′-AATCCATGGGCCAGAACACGTC-3′ and 5′-AGTTCTAGACGGTAGTCTCCCCCT-3′. The PCR product was digested by NcoI and XbaI and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of Myc-tagged Xfz3 in-frame with the signal peptide and Myc epitopes. The chimeric receptors Xfz3N/mFz1C and mFz1N/Xfz3C were generated by PCR amplification of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of mFz1 or Xfz3 with a sense primer, 5′-ACATTCGAATGGAGGAAGTTCTAC-3′ with a BstBI site or 5′-ACTGAATTCCTGGGCCAGCTTTTTC-3′ with an EcoRI site (underlined), respectively, and the T7 primer. The PCR products were cloned into the same sites in Myc-tagged Xfz3 or mFz1, respectively, and the XbaI site. To obtain Xfz3CRD/mFz1C, the sequence corresponding to the seven transmembrane and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of mFz1 was amplified by PCR using sense primer 5′-AGAGGAGCTCCGCTTCTCGCGC-3′ including a SacI site (underlined) and the T7 primer and subcloned into the SacI and XbaI sites of the Myc-tagged Xfz3. Immunoblotting—Cells were transfected with expression vectors as described above, and 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed (20 mm Tris-HCl (28Akhter S.A. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin), and then the protein content of cell lysates was determined with Bio-Rad DC protein assay. 50 μg of each cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the indicated primary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL Western blotting technique (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. Anti-Myc antibody was from Santa Cruz Technology, and the anti-β-catenin antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Xenopus Embryos and Microinjections—Xenopus eggs were obtained from females injected with 500 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma) and artificially fertilized with minced testis. Eggs were dejellied with 2% cysteine hydrochloride (pH 7.8) and kept in 0.1× modified Barth solution. Synthetic capped mRNAs were made by in vitro transcription as described previously (29Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos were injected at the four-cell stage near the animal pole region (for ectodermal explants) or in the two ventrovegetal blastomeres (for secondary axis induction) in 0.1× modified Barth solution containing 3% Ficoll-400. Ectodermal explants were dissected at blastula stage and cultured to early gastrula stage for RT-PCR analysis. RT-PCR—For RT-PCR, RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and were reverse-transcribed using 200 units of SuperScript (Invitrogen). PCR and primers for the Wnt/β-catenin target gene Siamois and the housekeeping gene ornithine decarboxylase were as described previously (29Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy Assay—COS-7 cells are plated at 40,000 cells/well in a 6-well plate; each well contained a sterile microcoverglass, which can be removed for observation. Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid (1 μg total) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Transfected cells were treated or not with Wnt3a-CM for 24 h, then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min, and washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed cells were permeabilized by phosphate-buffered saline, 0.025% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, 3% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. After that cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody, a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-catenin (Upstate Biotechnology), at 5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. After being washed two times cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit conjugated to FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:100 dilution. The cells were washed tree times, mounted on a glass slide, and viewed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). Up-regulation of mFz1 Expression by BMP-2 in Mesenchymal Cell Lines—The myoblast cell line C2C12 displays a certain degree of plasticity in terms of differentiation, and BMP-2 treatment is known to inhibit myotube formation and converts the differentiation pathway of C2C12 cells into that of the osteoblast lineage (31Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). To identify genes playing a role in the transdifferentiation of these pluripotent cells, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis by determining changes in expression levels of 27,000 genes with Affymetrix oligonucleotide chips (23Theilhaber J. Connolly T. Roman-Roman S. Bushnell S. Jackson A. Call K. Garcia T. Baron R. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Among these genes Frizzled-1 (mFz1) was found to be significantly increased in the presence of BMP-2 (Fig. 1A). This increase in the expression level of mFz1 was observed 24 h after BMP-2 treatment and was maintained until 4 days of culture. In contrast, TGF-β1, which inhibits myotube formation of C2C12 cells without inducing the osteoblastic phenotype (31Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), did not significantly affect mFz1 expression in our experiments. The increase in expression of mFz1 in response to BMP-2, but not to TGF-β1, was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) in C2C12 cells but also in two other murine mesenchymal pluripotent cell lines, ST2 and C3H10T1/2 (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of mFz1 Represses Activity of BMP-2 and Wnt3a—BMP-2 is known to induce the osteoblast phenotype in distinct pluripotent mesenchymal cell lines including C2C12, C3H10T1/2, and ST2. To investigate the significance of the up-regulation of mFz1 by BMP-2, we examined whether mFz1 overexpression could affect the responsiveness of these cells to BMP-2. mFz1, hFz1, and Xfz3 were cloned and expressed as Myc-tagged proteins and showed comparable expression levels when transfected in C2C12 cells (Fig. 2C) or in the other cells used (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, mFz1 significantly inhibits the BMP-2-induced ALP activity in C2C12. Similar data were obtained using ST-2 and C3H10T1/2 cells (data not shown), suggesting that mFz1 antagonizes the effects of BMP-2. We have recently demonstrated that BMP-2 controls ALP expression by a Wnt autocrine loop (32Rawadi G. Vayssiere B. Dunn F. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1842-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, mFz1 overexpression also inhibited Wnt3a-mediated ALP activity. Moreover mFz1 was also capable of significantly decreasing Wnt3a-mediated TCF-1 activation in COS cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, overexpression of human Frizzled-1, Xfz3 (Fig. 2, A and B), or Xfz4 (data not shown) did not decrease but rather enhanced either BMP-2 or Wnt3a activities in our assays. These observations demonstrate that mFz1 antagonizes the activity of BMP-2 and Wnt3a in different cell lines. Overexpression of mFz1 Blocks Nuclear β-Catenin Translocation in COS Cells—To investigate how mFz1 inhibits the activity of Wnt, we monitored nuclear β-catenin translocation induced by Wnt3a in the presence or absence of mFz1. COS cells were transfected with either a control vector expressing GFP or a construct that expresses both GFP and mFz1, and then cells were treated with Wnt3a-conditioned medium. Endogenous cellular β-catenin localization was determined by immunocytochemistry, and exogenous mFz1 expression was determined by GFP fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3, in cells transfected with GFP expression vector β-catenin is located both in the cytoplasm and at the membrane but not in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). Wnt3a treatment resulted in nuclear localization of β-catenin (Fig. 3B). Importantly mFz1 transfection precluded the Wnt3a-induced β-catenin nuclear localization (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3D, cells that show β-catenin nuclear localization in response to Wnt3a was markedly lower in mFz1-transfected cells compared with control. Finally we examined the effect of mFz1 overexpression on the TCF signaling induced by β-catenin* (27Morin P"

Moreover, Pax2 was frequently expressed, on spindle-shaped cells, in Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. We cloned PAX2 from Kaposi's sarcoma cells and obtained antisense and sense DNA. Transfection of Kaposi's sarcoma cells with antisense DNA, which suppressed Pax2 protein expression, reduced cell growth and survival and enhanced the sensitivity of Kaposi's sarcoma cells to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or vincristine treatment. In addition, antisense transfection inhibited the cell motility, the invasion of Matrigel, and the spindle shape morphology, which are characteristics of Kaposi's sarcoma cells. Moreover, the αvβ3 integrin, known to be involved in tumor invasion, was down-regulated. To evaluate the possible role of Pax2 expression in the endothelial origin of Kaposi's sarcoma cells, human microvascular endothelial cells were transfected with sense DNA. Endothelial cells transfected with sense PAX2 acquired spindle shape morphology, showed enhanced motility and Matrigel invasion, and displayed an enhanced expression of αvβ3 integrin. In conclusion, the expression of Pax2 by Kaposi's sarcoma cells correlated with an enhanced resistance against apoptotic signals and with the proinvasive phenotype. Moreover, PAX2-transfected endothelial cells acquired a phenotype resembling that of Kaposi's lesional cells, suggesting a role of this embryonic gene in tumorigenesis.

KS is frequently associated with conditions of immunodepression such as that occurring in HIV-1 infection and long term post-transplantation therapy (4Mitsuyasu R.T. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2000; 12: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The growth and diffusion of KS has been ascribed not only to a dysregulation of cellular proliferation but also to a resistance against apoptotic signals derived from the activation of endogenous or exogenous execution death programs. Several factors may contribute to resistance of apoptosis, including a dysregulation of the cytokine network, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of KS (5McCloskey T.W. Ott M. Tribble E. Khan S.A. Teichberg S. Paul M.O. Pahwa S. Verdin E. Chirmule N. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1014-1019PubMed Google Scholar), and the effect of HIV-derived proteins such as Tat (6Westendorp M.O. Frank R.

Recently, we found that HIV-1 Tat acts as survival factor for KS cells (7Cantaluppi V. Biancone L. Boccellino M. Doublier S. Benelli R. Carlone S. Albini A. Camussi G. AIDS. 2001; 10: 965-976Google Scholar) by a mechanism involving a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent pathway (8Deregibus M.C. Cantaluppi V. Doublier S. Brizzi M.F. Deambrosis I. Albini A.

It has been recently reported that paired box gene 2 (PAX2) expression suppresses apoptosis in renal collecting duct cells (9Torban E. Eccles M.R. Favor J. Goodyer P.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Pax2 protein is a transcription factor belonging to the evolutionary conserved paired box family involved in organogenesis. Pax2 is required for development of the central nervous system and genitourinary tract. In humans, Pax2 is expressed in induced mesenchyme and in the early epithelial derivates, and it is rapidly down-regulated in mature kidney (10Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The expression of Pax2 was observed in renal cell carcinomas (11Gnarra J.R. Dressler G.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4092-4098PubMed Google Scholar) and in mammary tumors (12Silberstein G.B. Dressler G.R. Van Horn K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A possible role of Pax2 expression in tumor growth has been suggested by using antisense oligonucleotide in renal carcinoma cells (11Gnarra J.R. Dressler G.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4092-4098PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether KS cells express Pax2 and whether its expression influences KS cell behavior. For this purpose, KS cells were transfected with the antisense PAX2 gene to inhibit Pax2 protein expression, and the resistance to apoptosis as well as the growth, the motility and the invasion of Matrigel were evaluated. Moreover, to study the possible role of Pax2 expression in the endothelial origin of Kaposi's sarcoma cells, human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were transfected with sense DNA. Reagents—Endothelial cell attachment factor, DMEM, and bovine serum albumin fraction V (tested for not more than 1 ng of endotoxin per mg) were purchased from Sigma. Modified MCDB131 medium was obtained from Invitrogen, and fetal calf serum (FCS) was from EuroClone Ltd. (Wetherby, West Yorkshire, UK). Polyclonal rabbit antibody (Ab) against Pax2 was purchased from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Anti-αvβ3, -αvβ5, and -β1 mAbs were from Chemicon Int. (Temecula, CA); fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule mAb was from Euroclone; anti-ICAM-1, anti-CD11α, and anti-CD11β mAbs were from BD Biosciences; and anti-E-selectin mAb was from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). Anti-αv and anti-β3 monomer mAbs were kindly provided by Guido Tarone (University of Torino, Italy). Vincristine and geneticine were obtained from Sigma. Detection of Pax2 in KS Lesions by Immunohistochemistry—Surgical sample from eight patients (age range, 49–77 years; sex, 4 male and 4 female patients) with KS were collected. Five were classical cutaneous KS lesions, two were visceral KS (one gastric and one lung primary localization), and one was a lymph node metastasis in a patient with visceral iatrogenic KS. The different cell types were characterized using either morphological criteria or immunohistochemistry with Abs directed toward cell-specific antigens (such as CD34 for spindle cells or factor VIII for vessels) (13Cassoni P. Sapino A. Deaglio S. Bussolati B. Volante M. Munaron L. Albini A. Torrisi A. Bussolati G. Cancer Res. 2002; 15: 2406-2413Google Scholar). Serial sections from representative paraffin-embedded blocks of human KS lesions were collected onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides and stained for Pax2 antigen. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 6% H2O2 for 5 min at room temperature. Anti-Pax2 Ab was diluted 1:150 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and applied to slides overnight at room temperature. Biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit serum diluted 1:2000 (Sigma) was incubated for 30 min followed by the streptavidin peroxidase LSAB2 method (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) for the second Ab reaction. The reaction product was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Omission of the primary Ab or substitution with an unrelated rabbit serum served as negative control. Cell Cultures—Four Kaposi's sarcoma cell lines were used: three primary cultures of Kaposi's sarcoma cells (KS cells, KS-C1, and KS-L3) (7Cantaluppi V. Biancone L. Boccellino M. Doublier S. Benelli R. Carlone S. Albini A. Camussi G. AIDS. 2001; 10: 965-976Google Scholar, 8Deregibus M.C. Cantaluppi V. Doublier S. Brizzi M.F. Deambrosis I. Albini A. Camussi G. J. Biol.

AIDS. 1997; 11: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These cell lines were previously characterized (7Cantaluppi V. Biancone L. Boccellino M. Doublier S. Benelli R. Carlone S. Albini A. Camussi G. AIDS. 2001; 10: 965-976Google Scholar) in comparison with a well characterized KS cell line (SLK) developed by Herndier et al. (39Herndier B. Werner A. Arnstein P. AIDS. 1994; 8: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured with DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% FCS and 2 mm glutamine (Sigma). HMEC were obtained from derma using anti-CD31 Ab coupled to magnetic beads, by magnetic cell sorting using the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA), and immortalized by infection of primary cultures with a replication-defective adeno-5/SV40 virus as previously described (15Conaldi P.G. Serra C. Mossa A. Falcone V. Basolo F. Camussi G. Dolei A. Toniolo A. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Two primary microvascular endothelial cell lines obtained from subcutaneous fat and three umbilical cord vein-derived endothelial cell lines (HUVEC) were prepared as previously described (16Bussolati B. Deambrosis I. Russo S. Deregibus M.C. Camussi G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1159-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were characterized as endothelial cells by morphology and positive staining for von Willebrand factor antigen and for CD31, CD105, and the fucosylated receptors for plant lectins (Ulex europeus I and Bandeira simplicifolia). Cytoplasmic staining was positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin and desmin, as previously described (17Deregibus M.C. Buttiglieri S. Russo S. Bussolati B. Camussi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18008-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A previously characterized renal carcinoma cell line (K1) was used as positive control for Pax2 expression (18Bussolati B. Russo S. Deambrosis I. Cantaluppi V. Volpe A. Ferrando U. Camussi G. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 100: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cloning of PAX2 Gene—Total RNA was extracted from KS cells with guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and washed with 70% ethanol. Two micrograms of RNA were retrotranscribed using oligo(dT) primers and 15 units of reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Five microliters of cDNA were amplified with forward and reverse primers (forward, ATGGATATGCACTGCAAAGCAGA; reverse, CTAGTGGCGGTCATAGGCAG) covering the initial and terminal part of the coding sequence, respectively (NCBI GenBank™ number GI409138), with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplified DNA was ligated in pTARGET mammalian expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter with the T/A cloning system. After sequencing various clones, we identified a clone with Pax2 in correct orientation (S) and a clone with Pax2 in inverse orientation (AS). DNA sequences were compared with the NCBI data base using the BLAST program. Transfection—Cells were seeded in a 10-cm Petri dish to reach confluence and transfected with 8 μg of DNA and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in DMEM containing 10% FCS without antibiotics, according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. As a control, cells were transfected with the empty plasmid (KS Ctrl). Transfected cells were stably selected by culturing in the presence of 1 mg/ml geneticine. Successful transfection was evaluated by positive immunofluorescence for anti-Pax2 Ab. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed at 4 °C for 1 h in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 100 units/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. The protein contents of the supernatants were measured by the Bradford method. Aliquots containing 10 μg of protein of the cell lysates were subjected to SDS-10% PAGE under reducing conditions and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane filters. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl plus 0.1% Tween (TBS-T). The membranes were subsequently immunoblotted overnight at 4 °C with the rabbit anti-Pax2 Ab. After extensive washing with TBS-T, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce), washed with TBS-T, developed with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min, and exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells with guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and washed with 70% ethanol. Two micrograms of RNA were retrotranscribed using oligo(dT) primers and 15 units of RT enzyme (Eppendorf). Two microliters of cDNA were amplified with forward (ATGGATATGCACTGCAAAGCAGA) and reverse (CGTGCTGGGAACAATGGTGTG) primers, with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Reactions were performed for 30 cycles at a melting temperature of 52 °C and analyzed with a BrEtOH 1.5% agarose gel. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were seeded at 8,000 cells/well into 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FCS and allowed to adhere. DNA synthesis was detected as incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into the cellular DNA using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after washing, cells were added with 10 μm BrdUrd and incubated in DMEM without FCS or in DMEM plus 10% FCS for 18 h. Cells were then fixed with 0.5 m ethanol/HCl and incubated with nuclease to digest the DNA. BrdUrd incorporated into the DNA was detected using an anti-BrdUrd peroxidase-conjugated mAb and visualized with a soluble chromogenic substrate. Optical density was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 405 nm. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were seeded on 6-well plates in the presence or in absence of serum and analyzed after a 24-h incubation at 37 °C. Cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of hypotonic solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A. Cells were analyzed with flow cytometry in linear mode. Results were expressed as percentages of elements detected in the different phases of the cell cycle, namely sub-G1 peak (apoptosis), G0/G1 (no DNA synthesis), S (active DNA synthesis), G2 (premitosis), and M (mitosis). Assessment of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was evaluated using the TUNEL assay analysis (ApopTag Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD). After serum withdrawal and/or treatment with 0.25 μg/ml vincristine for 24 h, cells were suspended in PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 15 min at 4 °C and then fixed in precooled ethanol/acetic acid (2:1) for 5 min at –20 °C. Cells were treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme and incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 1 h and then with FITC-conjugated anti-digoxigenin for 30 min at room temperature. After washings, samples were mounted in medium containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide, and the cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Results are expressed as a percentage of green fluorescence-emitting cells (apoptotic cells) versus red fluorescence-emitting cells (total cells). Detection of Caspase-3 and -9 Activity—Activation of caspase-3 and -9 was assessed by a colorimetric assay (Chemicon International) based on spectrophotometric detection of the chromophore p-nitroanilide (pNA) after cleavage from the labeled substrate DEVD-pNA, which is recognized by caspase-3, and LEHD-pNA, which is recognized by caspase-9. Lysates of treated or untreated cells were diluted 1:1 with 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7,4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% (3-(3-cholamido-propyl)dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate, pepstatin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml)). DEVD-pNA or LEHD-pNA was added at a final concentration of 50 μm, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The absorption values were measured at 405 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. In Vitro Cell Migration—A total of 1 × 105 cells/well were plated in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Cell migration was studied over a 4-h period under a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a ×20 phase-contrast objective in an attached, hermetically sealed Plexiglas Nikon NP-2 incubator at 37 °C. Cell migration was recorded using a JVC-1CCD video camera. Image analysis was performed with a MicroImage analysis system (Cast Imaging srl, Venice, Italy) and an IBM-compatible system equipped with a video card (Targa 2000; Truevision, Santa Clara, CA). Image analysis was performed by digital saving of images at 15-min intervals. Migration tracks were generated by marking the positions of the nuclei of individual cells on each image. The net migratory speed (velocity straight line) was calculated by the MicroImage software based on the straight line distance between the starting and ending points divided by the time of observation (17Deregibus M.C. Buttiglieri S. Russo S. Bussolati B. Camussi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18008-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Migration of at least 30 cells was analyzed for each experimental condition. Values are given as means ± S.D. Matrigel Invasion Assay—The assay for matrix invasion was performed in Transwell chambers (Costar, Cambridge, MA), by seeding 105 cells on the upper side porous polycarbonate membrane of 8-μm pore size coated with 12.5 μg of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) as previously described (19Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaroson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Cells migrated through the membrane of the lower side of the filter were counted after 24- or 72-h incubation by a computer-assisted analysis system (Cast Imaging). Immunofluorescence and Cytofluorimetric Analysis—Cultured cells were fixed for 10 min in a 4:1 mixture of acetone/chloroform, air-dried, and kept at –80 °C until use. The cells were then washed twice in PBS, blocked for 30 min with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and then incubated with the primary rabbit anti-Pax2 Ab diluted in PBS-bovine serum albumin (1:100) and with the secondary FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG Ab (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) and visualized on a Leica microscope with fluorescence optics. For cytofluorimetric analysis, cells were detached from plates with nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution, washed in PBS containing 2% heat-inactivated human serum, and incubated for another 15 min with whole heat-inactivated human serum to block the remaining nonspecific sites. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the appropriate Ab or with the irrelevant control in PBS containing 2% heat-inactivated human serum. Where a second step reagent was needed, cells were stained by the addition of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and incubated for a further 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). 10,000 cells were analyzed in each experimental point. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed in Karnowsky's fixative for 1 h, dehydrated in alcohol, dried, and coated with gold by sputter coating and examined in a scanning electron microscope (Jeol JSM T300) operating at 25 kV. The expression of Pax2 protein was evaluated by Western blot analysis on four Kaposi's cell lines, on immortalized HMEC, on two primary microvascular endothelial cell lines, on three HUVEC lines, and on K1 renal carcinoma cells used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1A, KS cells, KS-imm, and KS-C1 as well as K1 renal carcinoma cells strongly expressed Pax2 protein. The expression of Pax2 protein by KS-L3 was minimal. In contrast, all of the different endothelial cell lines were negative. The expression of Pax2 mRNA from KS cells was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the in vivo expression of Pax2 in Kaposi's sarcoma, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on five classical cutaneous and two visceral KS lesions and on lymph node metastases. The results obtained indicate that three cutaneous and two noncutaneous lesions (the gastric KS localization and the lymph node metastases) were positive for Pax2 expression on fusate spindle-shaped lesional cells (Fig. 1C), whereas vessels where negative. To study the possible relevance of Pax2 expression, the PAX2 gene was cloned from KS cells. Amplified DNA was ligated in pTARGET mammalian expression vector under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter with the T/A cloning system. After sequencing various clones, we identified a clone with PAX2 in correct orientation (S) and a clone with PAX2 in inverse orientation (AS). KS cells were stably transfected with PAX2 in inverse orientation (KS-AS), and the Pax2 protein expression was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2, the immunofluorescence staining of Pax2 was markedly reduced in KS-AS (Fig. 2B) with respect to KS-Ctrl transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 2A). The reduced expression of Pax2 protein in KS-AS cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2E). HMEC, which express a minimal amount of Pax2 protein (Fig. 2C), were conversely transfected with the vector containing sense DNA (HMEC-S) in order to obtain expression of Pax2 (Fig. 2D). As shown in Fig. 3, the growth of KS-AS cells was significantly reduced both in the presence or in the absence of FCS with respect to KS-Ctrl. Transfection of HMEC with sense PAX2 significantly enhanced cell BrdUrd uptake. Cell cycle analysis showed a significant reduction of G2/M and S peaks in KS-AS with respect to KS-Ctrl (Fig. 4). In addition, a marked increase in sub-G1 peak was observed both in the presence or absence of FCS, suggesting an enhanced apoptosis in cells transfected with PAX2 antisense. An enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis of KS-AS cells with respect to KS-Ctrl was also detected by a TUNEL assay (Fig. 5A). This was already detectable in the presence of FCS and markedly enhanced after serum starvation and vincristine treatment. The antiapoptotic effect of Pax2 was confirmed by the observation that HMEC-S were significantly more resistant to apoptosis induced both by serum deprivation and vincristine with respect to HMEC-Ctrl. The increased sensitivity of KS-AS to apoptosis was also indicated by the enhanced activation of caspase-9 and -3 after serum deprivation and vincristine treatment (Fig. 5, B and C). The basal motility of KS cells detected by time lapse cinematography was significantly decreased in KS-AS with respect to KS-Ctrl (Fig. 6, A–C). Conversely, transfection of HMEC with PAX2 sense DNA significantly enhanced cell motility with respect to HMEC-Ctrl (Fig. 6, A, D, and E). The in vitro invasive property in Matrigel and the spindle shape morphology are considered characteristic features of KS lesional cells (20Becksted J.H. Woods G.S. Fletcher V. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 294-300PubMed Google Scholar, 21Corbeil J. Evans L.A. Vasak E. Cooper D.A. Penney R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2972-2976PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jussila L. Valtola R. Partanen T.A. Salven P. Heikkila P. Matikainen M.T. Renkonen R. Kalpainen A. Detmar M. Tschachler E. Alitalo R. Alitalo K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1599-1604PubMed Google Scholar, 23Salahuddin S.Z. Nakamura S.

Voland J.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 130: 244-251PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the effect of Pax2 expression on these properties. As shown in Fig. 7, invasiveness of Matrigel by KS-AS was significantly reduced with respect to KS-Ctrl, whereas invasiveness of Matrigel by HMEC-S was significantly enhanced with respect to HMEC-Ctrl. Moreover, KS-AS lost the characteristic spindle shape morphology observed in KS-Ctrl (Fig. 8, A–D). In analogy to this result, HMEC-S tended to develop a spindle shape resembling that of KS cells (Fig. 8, E–H).Fig. 8Micrographs representative of the morphological changes induced by transfection of KS cells and HMEC with the PAX2 antisense or sense vectors. KS-Ctrl showed characteristics spindle cell morphology by phase-contrast (A) and scanning electron microscopy (B). KS-AS showed the loss of spindle shape morphology after transfection with PAX2 antisense by phase-contrast (C) and scanning electron microscopy (D). HMEC-Ctrl showed the characteristic cobblestone-like appearance by phase-contrast (E) and a very flattened appearance with nuclei and nucleoli protruding from the even surface by scanning electron microscopy (F). After transfection with PAX2 sense vector, HMEC-S tended to lose contact with neighbor cells and developed a spindle shape morphology (G and H). A, C, E, and G, magnification was ×250; B, D, F, and H, magnification was ×1000. Three different experiments were performed with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the potential mechanism by which Pax2 may regulate the invasive phenotype, we studied the effect of transfection of KS cells with PAX2 antisense and of HMEC with PAX2 sense on several adhesion molecules. As shown in Fig. 9, the αvβ3 dimer was significantly down-regulated in KS-AS and up-regulated in HMEC-S in comparison with the respective controls. The observed variations of the αvβ3 dimer were due to changes in the expression of the β3 monomer (KS-AS, 12.2 ± 3.5%; KS-Ctrl, 82.2 ± 4.7%; HMEC-S, 78 ± 7.2%; HMEC-Ctrl, 19.4 ± 3.4%), whereas the expression of the αv monomer was unchanged (KS-AS, 95.7 ± 1.8%; KS-Ctrl, 98.3 ± 2.3%; HMEC-S, 75.8 ± 5.3%; HMEC-Ctrl, 72.1 ± 7.0%). No significant changes in αvβ5, β1, CD11α and CD11β, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, ICAM-1, and E-selectin were observed (data not shown). In the present study, we demonstrated that KS cells express Pax2 and that its expression contributes to resistance to apoptosis and the proinvasive phenotype of KS cells. Aside from dysregulation of cellular proliferation, the resistance to apoptotic signals has been implicated in the pathogenesis of KS. Indeed, KS cells, despite the expression of Fas on their surface, were shown to be resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis (25Mori S. Murakami-Mori K. Jewett A. Nakamura S. Bonavida B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1874-1879PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, KS cells derived from AIDS patients were reported to be often resistant to chemotherapy drugs (26Lee F.C. Mitsuyasu R.T. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 1996; 10: 1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat has an antiapoptotic effect on vincristine-treated KS cells (8Deregibus M.C. Cantaluppi V. Doublier S. Brizzi M.F. Deambrosis I. Albini A. Camussi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25195-25202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Gene expression analysis by Gene array technology demonstrated that KS cells expressed several antiapoptotic genes, including Akt-1 and Akt-2, Bcl2, Bcl-xL, MCL-1, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (8Deregibus M.C.

PAX2, a gene coding for a transcription factor belonging to the evolutionary conserved paired box family involved in organogenesis (27Dahl E. Koseki H. Balling R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), has been recently shown to protect renal collecting duct cells from apoptosis. Moreover, it has been shown that PAX2 is frequently expressed in primary human cancers, suggesting its possible involvement in the cancer pathogenesis (10Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 11Gnarra J.R. Dressler G.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4092-4098PubMed Google Scholar, 28Muratovska A. Zhou C. He S. Goodyer P. Eccles M.R. Oncogene. 2003; 11: 6045-6053Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that several Kaposi's sarcoma cell lines markedly expressed both Pax2 mRNA and Pax2 protein. The immunohistochemical analysis of classical cutaneous and visceral and lymphatic KS lesions suggests that Pax2 is frequently expressed in KS lesional cells in vivo. However, the expression of Pax2 was not detected in all tumors, and in positive tumors only a variable fraction of tumor cells expressed this protein. This is consistent with immunohistochemical studies on other primary tumors, suggesting that PAX2 gene function is required only at certain stages of tumor cell development (28Muratovska A. Zhou C. He S. Goodyer P. Eccles M.R. Oncogene. 2003; 11: 6045-6053Google Scholar). These results prompted us to evaluate whether Pax2 expression plays a role in the KS tumorigenesis. A previous study demonstrated that when renal carcinoma cells expressing high levels of Pax2 were treated with antisense Pax2 oligonucleotides, in vitro, cell number was dramatically reduced (11Gnarra J.R. Dressler G.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4092-4098PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, PAX2 was cloned from KS cells, and antisense and sense DNA were obtained. Transfection of KS cells with antisense DNA inhibited incorporation of BrdUrd, suggesting a reduced growth. The analysis of the cell cycle evidenced a significant difference in the S or G2/M phases between KS-AS and control cells transfected with the empty vector. Moreover, cells in the hypodiploid phase (sub-G1 peak) were significantly increased in KS-AS, suggesting that transfection with PAX2 antisense had a major effect on apoptosis. It has been recently shown that high levels of Pax2 protein were necessary for survival of renal collecting duct cells and optimal branching morphogenesis during renal development. Expression of Pax2 in renal cells was shown to protect these cells against apoptotic death induced by caspase 2 (9Torban E. Eccles M.R. Favor J. Goodyer P.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed by TUNEL assay that transfection with PAX2 antisense DNA significantly increased the number of apoptotic KS cells in basal conditions and enhanced the sensitivity of KS cells to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or vincristine treatment. The observation that transfection of HMEC with sense PAX2 DNA conferred resistance to apoptosis and to a minor extent stimulated proliferation confirms that Pax2 primary function is antiapoptotic. An association has been reported between apoptosis and other members of the paired box gene families (9Torban E. Eccles M.R. Favor J. Goodyer P.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Pax3 mutant mice exhibited increased apoptosis of somatic mesoderma (29Borycku A.G. Li J. Emerson Jr., C.P. Epstein J.A. Development. 1999; 126: 1665-1674PubMed Google Scholar). Pax2, Pax5, and Pax8 all inhibit transcription of p53, a pivotal molecule regulating the final common apoptotic pathway (30Stuart E.T. Haffner R. Oren M. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5638-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 31Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 8: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). In addition, Pax6 mutation has been shown to correlate with an excessive apoptosis of photoreceptor precursor (32Halder G. Callaerts P. Flister S. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gering W.J. Development. 1998; 125: 2181-2191PubMed Google Scholar). The possible relevance of Pax2 expression to pathogenesis of KS is also supported by the inhibitory effect of antisense transfection on cell motility, invasion of Matrigel, and spindle shape morphology, which are characteristics of KS cells. Although the exact origin of KS spindle cells remains unclear, it appears that these cells may have a mesenchymal origin. It has been suggested that KS cells may derive from lymphatic endothelial cells or vascular cell precursors that were infected by HHV-8. Indeed, in vitro experiments demonstrated that HHV-8 is able to infect endothelial cells, inducing a spindle cell morphology and increasing proliferative life span (33Flore O. Rafii S. Ely S. O'Leary J.J. Hyjek E.M. Cesarman E. Nature. 1998; 394: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 34Moses A.V. Fish K.N. Ruhl R. Smith P.P. Strussenberg J.G. Zhu L. Chandran B. Nelson J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6892-6902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, transfection of HMEC with sense PAX2 induced spindle shape morphology and enhanced motility and Matrigel invasive properties, suggesting the involvement of PAX2 in the possible origin of KS cells from endothelium. A potential mechanism by which Pax2 may regulate the invasive phenotype is the modulation of integrin expression. Indeed, we observed that the αvβ3 dimer was significantly down-regulated in KS transfected with PAX2 antisense and up-regulated in HMEC transfected with PAX2 sense. Independent of its role in tumor angiogenesis, integrin αvβ3 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers. This is particularly apparent for KS, where αvβ3 is highly expressed in vitro and in vivo (35Ensoli B. Gendelman R. Markham P. Fiorelli V. Colombini S. Raffeld M. Cafaro A. Chang H.K. Brady J.N. Gallo R.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 36Uccini S. Ruco L.P. Monardo F. Stoppacciaro A. Dejana E. La Parola I.L. Cerimele D. Baroni C.D. J.

Histopathology. 1996; 29: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In humans, the oncogenic potential of Pax2 remains to be determined. In mice, it has been shown that the induction of tumor formation was dependent on the type of paired domain but did not require the presence of homeodomain. It has been suggested that the oncogenic potential of Pax proteins is dependent on the DNA-binding function of the paired motif. Therefore, not only the Pax3 and Pax6 proteins containing intact homeodomain, but also Pax2 and Pax8 containing residual homeodomain and Pax1, completely lacking a homeodomain, were able to induce transformation of cell culture and tumor formation in mice (38Maulbecker C.C. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the present study, the expression of Pax2 by KS cells correlated with enhanced resistance against apoptotic signals derived from activation of endogenous execution programs and exogenous stimuli and with the proinvasive phenotypes of KS cells. Altogether, these results suggest that Pax gene products are not only involved in controlling embryogenesis, but, if deregulated, they can also induce tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2031239301,"Myeloid ELF1-like factor (MEF), also known as ELF4, is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors which is expressed in hematopoietic cells. MEF-deficient mice have defects in natural killer cell and natural killer T cell development, suggesting a role for MEF in regulating innate immunity. MEF also functions in myeloid cells, where it can transactivate target genes. To identify MEF target genes in a “myeloid” environment, we created an inducible expression system and used oligonucleotide microarrays to examine the transcript profile of HEL cells after induction of MEF expression. Sixteen genes were reproducibly turned on or off more than 2-fold, 8 h after induction of MEF expression, and we examined one of the genes, interleukin-8 (IL-8), in greater detail. IL-8 is a CXC chemokine involved in neutrophil chemoattraction, angiogenesis, and stem cell mobilization. It is expressed by several tumor types, and its expression is regulated primarily transcriptionally. The IL-8 promoter contains three ETS binding sites, and we identified the specific site that binds MEF and is required for MEF responsiveness. MEF, but not the closely related ETS factors PEA3, ETS1, ETS2, ELF1, or PU.1, strongly activates the IL-8 promoter. MEF overexpression is sufficient to induce IL-8 protein expression, and reduction in MEF expression (using RNA interference) results in decreased IL-8 levels. These data demonstrates that MEF is an important regulator of IL-8 expression.

Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar). ETS proteins generally regulate transcription in coordination with other transcription factors, binding the core ETS binding sequence GGAA, via their ETS domain. Because this sequence occurs frequently in genomic DNA, the identification of true ETS target genes has been difficult. Furthermore, the significant homology in the ETS domains of these proteins makes it daunting to determine which ETS factor regulates a particular gene in vivo. Although cytokine and cytokine receptor genes and many other genes have been proposed as targets of various ETS factors (for review, see Ref. 2Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), their validation as in vivo targets has rarely been performed. Microarrays have been used extensively to profile the transcripts expressed in tumor or normal tissue, both as a way to define their biology and also to determine which genes serve as determinants for their classification. We and others have used microarrays to identify genes regulated by particular transcription factors such as C/EBPα (3Cammenga J. Mulloy J.C. Berguido F.J. MacGrogan D. Viale A. Nimer S.D. Blood. 2003; 101: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), c-Myc (4Coller H.A. Grandori C. Tamayo P. Colbert T. Lander E.S. Eisenman R.N. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These studies have identified target genes not previously described and have failed to find gene targets previously identified by reporter gene assays. Thus, subsequent validation of direct (and indirect) targets will generally require the use of multiple additional approaches to confirm the results. MEF is a member of the Drosophila E74 subfamily of ETS proteins which includes the mammalian NERF and ELF1 proteins. We have shown that MEF regulates cytokine gene expression, including GM-CSF and IL-3 (1Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar). Other ETS factors have been shown to regulate the expression of chemokines, such as RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) (7Boehlk S. Fessele S. Mojaat A.

Although MEF and ELF1 are highly homologous, especially in their ETS domain, and they bind to the same DNA recognition sequence, MEF appears to be a more potent transactivator of promoter function (1Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar). MEF also is required for perforin expression by NK cells but not activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (34Lacorazza H.D. Miyazaki Y. Di Cristofano A. Deblasio A. Hedvat C. Zhang J. Cordon-Cardo C. Mao S. Pandolfi P.P. Nimer S.D. Immunity. 2002; 17: 437-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To identify MEF targets in hematopoietic cells, we established an inducible expression system in HEL cells, which have no detectable MEF mRNA or protein. We identified a number of MEF target genes using Affymetrix microarrays and focused primarily on IL-8, a member of the chemokine family with pleiotropic functions, including roles in stem cell mobilization (13Fibbe W.E. Pruijt J.F. Velders G.A. Opdenakker G. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Willemze R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 872: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), angiogenesis, and chemotaxis (14Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The promoter of IL-8 has been identified previously, and both nuclear factor-κB and c-Jun have been shown to regulate its activity (15Mukaida N. Shiroo M. Matsushima K. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1366-1371PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8 is expressed by a variety of tumor types and is inducibly expressed in several myeloid leukemia cell lines after 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation (16Steube K.G. Meyer C. Drexler H.G. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1236-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). PEA3 has been suggested to be the ETS factor that controls IL-8 expression, although direct effects of PEA3 on IL-8 promoter function were not assessed (17Iguchi A. Kitajima I. Yamakuchi M. Ueno S. Aikou T. Kubo T. Matsushima K. Mukaida N. Maruyama I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that MEF and ETS2 antagonistically regulate IL-8 expression in a lung carcinoma cell line, with MEF acting as a repressor (18Seki Y. Suico M.A. Uto A. Hisatsune A. Shuto T. Isohama Y. Kai H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6579-6586PubMed Google Scholar). We show that MEF strongly activates the IL-8 promoter in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells and that overexpression of MEF is sufficient to increase significantly the level of IL-8 protein expression. Furthermore, knock-down of MEF expression in cells that express both MEF and IL-8 by RNA interference, decreases IL-8 expression, demonstrating the physiologic relevance of MEF in regulating IL-8 production. Generation of Cells with Inducible MEF Expression—HEL cells and NB4-306 (a subclone of NB4, which is ATRA-resistant) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and COS-7 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, all supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. HEL cells were electroporated (using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) set at 250 mV, 960 microfarads) with the pVgRXR plasmid (Invitrogen), which expresses a fusion of the ecdysone receptor and the VP-16 transactivating domain and the RXR cDNA. Stably transfected clones were then selected in 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). These cells were electroporated with the pIND-MEF vector (which can express MEF in response to the active ecdysone receptor fusion protein), and clones were selected in 100 μg/ml hygromycin to isolate double transfected cells. To induce MEF expression, HEL/IND-MEF cells were incubated with the synthetic ecdysone analog, ponasterone A (Invitrogen), at a final concentration of 5 μm for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. MEF levels were assessed by Western blot analysis using a 1:1,000 dilution of the MEF polyclonal antiserum (which is described elsewhere (19Miyazaki Y. Boccuni P. Mao S. Zhang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kiyokawa H. Nimer S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40528-40536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). Oligonucleotide Array-based Expression Profiling—Total RNA was isolated from HEL/IND-MEF cells after an 8-h incubation with 5 μm ponasterone A, using TrIzol (Invitrogen) followed by RNeasy purification (Qiagen). The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to oligonucleotide arrays, as described elsewhere (20Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), using the HuGeneFL Affymetrix GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) containing probe sets for 6,800 genes and expressed sequence tags. The results were analyzed with Affymetrix microarray suite (MAS 5.0). Only genes showing greater than 2-fold induction or repression, called “present” in the induced sample and called “induced” or “repressed” at a p < 0.001 by MAS 5.0, compared with base-line expression in HEL/VgRXR cells incubated with ponasterone A, were chosen for further consideration. Plasmid Construction—The MEF cDNA containing the entire open reading frame was cloned into the HindIII/XhoI site of the pIND vector to generate pIND-MEF. The 5′-region (-165 to +58) of the human IL-8 promoter was generated by PCR using genomic DNA as a template. The 5′-primer contained an XhoI site to facilitate cloning (5′-CCCTCGAGCATACTCCGTATTTGATAAGGAAC), and the 3′-PCR primer contained an HindIII site (5′-GGCTCTTGTCCTAGAAGCTT). The PCR product was then digested with XhoI and HindIII and subcloned into pGL3Basic (to create pGL3-Basic-IL8). To mutate ETS binding sites in this construct, the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was used with the following primers (the mutated bp are in lowercase and underlined): for EBS1, 5′-CATCAGTTGCAAATCGTGacATTTCCTCTGACATAATG and 5′-CATTATGTCAGAGGAAATgtCACGTATTTGCAACTGATG; for EBS2, 5′-GGAACAAATAGacAGTGTGATGACTCAGG and 5′-CCTGAGTCATCACACTgtCTATTTGTTCC; and for EBS3, 5′-CTCCGTATTTGATAAGacACAAATAGGAAGTGTG and 5′-CACACTTCCTATTTGTgtCTTATCAAATACGGAG. The DNA sequence of all wild type and mutated IL-8 promoter constructs was confirmed. PEA3 was cloned by reverse transcription PCR from K562 cells using the Superscript one-step reverse transcription PCR system (Invitrogen) and the following primers: 5′-ATGGAGCGGAGGATGAAAGC and 5′-ATGGAGCGGAGGATGAAAGC. The PEA3 cDNA insert was sequenced (anti-PEA3, Santa Cruz, SC-113, mouse monoclonal IgG1). The ETS1 and ETS2 plasmids were generous gift from Dr. Dennis Watson. The ELF1 cDNA was kindly provided by Craig Thompson and the PU.1 cDNA by Robert Maki. Protein expression from each of the expression vectors was confirmed by Western blot analysis of transiently transfected COS-7 cell extracts (data not shown). Luciferase Reporter Assays—5 μg of either the pCMV5 cytomegalovirus promoter-based expression vector alone or pCMV5 containing the MEF, ETS1, ETS2, PU.1, ELF1, or PEA3 cDNA (1Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar) was used to cotransfect COS-7 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method together with 1 μg of pGL3-Basic-IL8 and 10 ng of pRL-CMV control plasmid, used to control for transfection efficiency. HEL cells were electroporated in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum without antibiotics at 250 mV, 960 microfarads with 10 μg of reporter plasmid, 10 μg of expression vector, and 100 ng of pRL-CMV. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection, and 10 μl of lysate was assayed using the dual luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysates were prepared from COS-7 cells or HEL cells using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Samples were boiled, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Hybond-ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-MEF antiserum (previously generated (19Miyazaki Y. Boccuni P. Mao S. Zhang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kiyokawa H. Nimer S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40528-40536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) using goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) as the secondary antibody. Blots were developed using the SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—MEF protein and PEA3 protein were generated by in vitro transcription/translation using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 2 μl of in vitro translated MEF (or PEA3) was incubated with 1 ng of the indicated probes end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Samples were electrophoresed using 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE. The specificity of binding was determined using a 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe as competitor. The complementary oligonucleotides used for the EMSA analysis are as follows: EBS2/3, 5′-ATAAGGAACAAATAGGAAGTGTGATGACTCAGG; EBS1, 5′-GTTGCAAATCGTGGAATTTCCTCTGA; mEBS1, 5′-GTTGCAAATCGTGacaTTTCCTCTGA. Measurement of IL-8 Protein—Conditioned medium was collected from HEL/VgRXR and HEL/Ind-MEF cells at various time points after stimulation with ponasterone A and assayed using an IL-8 Quantikine kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis) per the manufacturer's directions. Real Time PCR Assay—One μg of total RNA was processed to cDNA by reverse transcription with Superscript II (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT) primer, according to the manufacturer's protocol. All PCR primers and TaqMan probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems (MEF, Hs00154964_m1; IL-8, Hs00174103_m1) and were labeled with the reporter dye FAM or VIC. Amplification reactions contained 10 ng of cDNA and were performed using the Universal TaqMan 2X PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) in a total volume of 50 μl. All reactions were performed in triplicate using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems); the thermal cycling conditions were 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase amplification was used to normalize the expression data for IL-8. Primers for amplifying the IL-8 and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase cDNA were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—2 × 107 NB4-306 or HEL cells were processed using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, asynchronously growing NB4-306 or HEL cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine. The cells were washed in Tris-buffered saline and harvested in SDS buffer. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer and sonicated (Fisher Scientific, model 500) to yield DNA-protein complexes with an average length of DNA of 300-500 bp. The lysate was precleared and then immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight with 1-2 μg of polyclonal antibodies specific for MEF, acetyl-histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology, 06-866), or c-Jun (SC-122), PEA3 (SC-113), ETS2 (SC-112), ELF1 (SC-631), and PU.1 (SC-352) (all from Santa Cruz). To recover immune complexes, blocked protein A beads were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed thoroughly, the complexes eluted, the cross-links reversed, and the material recovered by phenolchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The amount of IL-8 genomic DNA in the immunoprecipitate was determined by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers (which amplify a region spanning all three EBSs): 5′-CCCTCGAGCATACTCCGTATTTGATAAGGAAC and 5′-GGCTCTTGTCCTAGAAGCTT. Short Interfering (si)RNA Preparation—21-nucleotide-long RNA molecules were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The complementary oligonucleotides were 2′-deprotected, annealed, and purified by the manufacturer. The siRNA sequence selected for these experiments was compared with the human genome sequence using a BLAST search to ensure specificity for the desired sequence. The sequence targeting enhanced GFP was 5′-CCUGUCUCUCAGUACAAUCUU-3′ (antisense); 5′-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3′ (sense), and MEF was 5′-GGAGGUACUGAAGAUCUGCUU-3′ (antisense); 5′-AAGCAGAUCUUCAGUACCUCC-3′ (sense). 200 pmol of each siRNAs was introduced by electroporation of NB4-306 cells in RPMI + 10% fetal calf serum without antibiotics at 250 mV, 960 microfarads daily for 2 consecutive days. RNA was extracted (as above) 72 h after the first electroporation. MEF and IL-8 mRNA levels were determined by real time PCR. MEF Target Gene Identification Using Microarrays—We used high density oligonucleotide microarrays to search for genes whose expression is altered after the inducible expression of MEF in HEL human erythroleukemia cells (Fig. 1A). In these cells with tightly regulated, ponasterone A-inducible MEF expression, MEF protein is not present in the absence of ponasterone A but is detectable by Western blot as early as 2 h postinduction (Fig. 1B). To identify direct transcriptional targets, cells were grown in the presence of ponasterone A for 8 h, at which time total RNA was isolated and used to interrogate oligonucleotide arrays representing 6800 known genes and expressed sequence tags. Expression profiles in cells expressing MEF were compared with ponasterone A-stimulated HEL cells that contain the RXR/EcR heterodimer alone and do not inducibly express MEF (data not shown). Using strict criteria, 13 genes were up-regulated greater than 2-fold, and three genes were down-regulated (Table I). If the -fold change threshold is lowered to 1.5 times, the list was expanded to 39 genes that were up-regulated and 14 genes that were down-regulated (data not shown). The most highly induced gene was IL-8 (which increased an average of 11.7-fold). Other genes induced by MEF included another chemokine, CXCL2 (gro-beta) and several other genes important to hematopoietic function including c-kit, MDR1, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase.Table IMEF target genes Genes either increased or decreased greater than 2-fold are indicated and ranked in order of -fold change.

We generated a reporter gene construct containing the -165 to +44 region of the IL-8 promoter, which contains three potential EBSs upstream of the luciferase gene. Cotransfection assays in both COS-7 cells and HEL cells showed that MEF activates the IL-8 promoter (72-fold in COS-7 cells and 14-fold in HEL cells). In contrast, none of the related ETS transcription factors ELF1, PEA3, ETS1, ETS2, or PU.1 transactivates this construct more than 2-fold (Fig. 2, A and B). Mutation of two of the three potential ETS binding sites in the IL-8 promoter (EBS2 and EBS3), did not alter its MEF responsiveness or its basal activity (Fig. 2C). However, MEF responsiveness was lost when the most 3′-ETS binding site (EBS1) was mutated. Mutations in the individual EBSs did not significantly affect the basal IL-8 promoter activity (mEBS1, 1.6-fold; mEBS2, 1.2-fold, mEBS3, 1.3-fold relative to the construct with three wild type EBSs). To determine whether the EBS1 ETS binding sequence was responding directly to the expression of MEF, we performed EMSAs to examine the binding of in vitro translated MEF (or PEA3) to EBS1, EBS2, and EBS3. Sequence-specific binding of MEF to the radiolabeled EBS1 probe was observed (Fig. 3A) which was competed by the wild type EBS1 oligonucleotide but not by a mutant EBS1 (mEBS1) or the EBS2/3 oligonucleotide that contains the other two ETS binding sites. MEF does not bind to EBS2/3 (Fig. 3B, lane 9). However we confirmed the work of Iguchi et al. (17Iguchi A. Kitajima I. Yamakuchi M. Ueno S. Aikou T. Kubo T. Matsushima K. Mukaida N. Maruyama I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) who showed that PEA3 binds to the 5′-AGGAAG-3′ sequence within EBS2 (Fig. 3B, lane 11). PEA3 also binds to EBS1 (Fig. 3B, lane 5); however, the IL-8 promoter is not activated by PEA3 expression in COS-7 cells. MEF Is Bound to the IL-8 Promoter in Vivo—To establish whether MEF is bound to the IL-8 promoter in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using anti-MEF antiserum. Chemical cross-linking of chromatin from NB4-306 cells, which are known to express constitutively both MEF and IL-8 (16Steube K.G. Meyer C. Drexler H.G. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1236-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), was followed by immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies (Fig. 3C). Using PCR to amplify the -165 to +44 portion of the IL-8 promoter, we found MEF bound to this region of DNA in the basal state (lane 4). Using antibodies against other ETS factors that are expressed in NB4-306 cells but were not able to activate the IL-8 reporter in cotransfection studies, we found that neither ELF1 (lane 6), PEA3 (lane 7), PU.1 (lane 8), nor ETS2 (lane 9) was bound to the IL-8 promoter in NB4-306 cells. Of note, ETS1 was not detectable by Western blot in NB4-306 cells. In HEL cells, which do not express MEF, we could not immunoprecipitate the IL-8 promoter with anti-MEF antibodies (lane 5). Anti-acetyl-histone H3 (lane 4) and anti-c-Jun (lane 6) antibodies did detect binding of these proteins to the IL-8 promoter, as expected. MEF Expression Increases IL-8 Protein Production—To confirm our microarray data and define the time course of IL-8 expression in response to MEF induction, we performed real time PCR to monitor changes in the level of IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 4A). IL-8 mRNA is expressed at a minimal level in HEL/IND-MEF cells, increases when MEF is induced at 4 h (27.5-fold), and is ∼10-fold higher than its baseline at 8 h. Given the profound transactivating effects of MEF on the IL-8 promoter, we sought to determine whether MEF overexpression was sufficient to drive the expression of IL-8 protein in cells. We performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on conditioned media obtained from HEL/IND-MEF cells at various time points after MEF induction (Fig. 4B). IL-8 significantly accumulates in the medium (∼52-fold compared with control at 8 h), demonstrating that overexpression of MEF alone is sufficient to induce IL-8 protein expression. The concentration of IL-8 in the medium, which ranged from 1.9 to 6.8 nm during the 24-h period, is biologically relevant as it exceeds the concentration required for high affinity binding to the CXCR1 and CXCR2 IL-8 receptors (Kd = 2 nm). Effect of siMEF on Endogenous IL-8 Expression in NB4-306 Cells—To determine whether MEF is an important regulator of IL-8 expression in vivo, we used RNA interference to knock-down the level of MEF mRNA (and protein) in NB4-306 cells. For these studies, we used 21-nucleotide siRNA complementary to MEF sequences, whereas siRNA duplexes specific for GFP were used as a control. Introduction of MEF siRNA into NB4-306 cells decreased MEF mRNA levels by ∼90% (Fig. 5). This reduction of MEF expression resulted in a 40% decrease in IL-8 mRNA expression, demonstrating the physiologic role of MEF in regulating IL-8 expression. The identification of true ETS target genes is complicated by the simplicity of their consensus recognition elements (GGAA), which are present at high frequency throughout genomic DNA and by the great number of related ETS proteins, which are often coexpressed in several different cell types. We have used an inducible expression system in the human HEL leukemia cell line to identify MEF target genes in vivo and have extensively characterized the promoter of one of these genes, namely IL-8. Several of these genes play important roles in hematopoietic cell growth and function including c-kit, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and MDR1, but it will be necessary to further evaluate each of these genes, to examine the importance of MEF in their constitutive or induced expression. Several of the genes activated by MEF in this system have been reported previously to be regulated by ETS proteins including c-kit (22Ratajczak M.Z. Perrotti D. Melotti P. Powzaniuk M. Calabretta B. Onodera K. Kregenow D.A. Machalinski B. Gewirtz A.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 1934-1946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and IL-8 (17Iguchi A. Kitajima I. Yamakuchi M. Ueno S. Aikou T. Kubo T. Matsushima K. Mukaida N. Maruyama I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We reported previously that MEF can transactivate the IL-3 and GM-CSF promoters in transient transfection studies (1Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar); however, neither gene was identified as an MEF target in this study, possibly because of the lack of specific cofactors required for their induction. In fact, IL-3 and GM-CSF expression was not found in HEL cells by microarray either in the absence or presence of MEF. We have shown that MEF, and not several other ETS factors, strongly activates IL-8 protein expression. IL-8 is produced by myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells, both constitutively and in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (16Steube K.G. Meyer C. Drexler H.G. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1236-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Steube K.G. Meyer C. Drexler H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that PEA3 may mediate the induction of IL-8 expression through one of these ETS response elements in hepatoma cells (17Iguchi A. Kitajima I. Yamakuchi M. Ueno S. Aikou T. Kubo T. Matsushima K. Mukaida N. Maruyama I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, no transactivation studies were performed. We have shown that PEA3 binds to IL-8 promoter sequences in vitro, but not in vivo, and it does not activate the promoter. In contrast, overexpression of MEF strongly positively regulates IL-8 expression in hematopoietic cells, and reduction in MEF levels using RNA interference, in hematopoietic cells that express both MEF and IL-8 (NB4-306), leads to a significant reduction in IL-8 levels, supporting a critical role for MEF in IL-8 regulation. IL-8 is known to act as a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, and it can function as a proangiogenic factor in some systems. Although perhaps counterintuitive, myeloid leukemias appear to have some dependence on angiogenesis, as they express proangiogenic molecules, and increased bone marrow high microvessel density may confer a poor prognosis in AML (24Aguayo A. Giles F. Albitar M. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2003; 44: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Expression of MEF by myeloid (and lymphoid) leukemia cells could increase IL-8 expression, stimulating bone marrow angiogenesis, and enhancing leukemia cell growth and survival in the marrow microenvironment. Although the best prognosis AMLs (FAB subtypes M2 and M3) have the lowest level of MEF mRNA (25Fukushima T. Miyazaki Y. Tsushima H. Tsutsumi C. Taguchi J. Yoshida S. Kuriyama K. Scadden D. Nimer S. Tomonaga M. Leuk. Res. 2003; 27: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), IL-8 production has not been quantitatively examined or correlated with specific FAB subtypes of AML. Vascular endothelial growth factor (26Padro T. Bieker R. Ruiz S. Steins M. Retzlaff S. Burger H. Buchner T. Kessler T. Herrera F. Kienast J. Muller-Tidow C. Serve H. Berdel W.E. Mesters R.M. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) is an angiogenic factor secreted by leukemic blasts whose expression correlates with microvessel density, and blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling is currently being evaluated as anticancer therapy. Other factors, such as IL-8, may play a role in the angiogenic process as well and could serve as another possible target. Although many murine chemokines have been identified, there is no known murine homolog of IL-8. Even the closely related chemokine, KC, which shares some functional overlap with IL-8, does not appear to be its direct murine homolog. This limitation has precluded further use of mouse models, such as generating “IL-8-deficient” mice to define its role in angiogenic and other processes. Likewise, the lack of a murine homolog has precluded us from using MEF-deficient mice to characterize further its role in IL-8 expression. IL-8 induces the rapid mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells in mice and primates (13Fibbe W.E. Pruijt J.F. Velders G.A. Opdenakker G. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Willemze R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 872: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Laterveer L. Lindley I.J. Heemskerk D.P. Camps J.A. Pauwels E.K. Willemze R. Fibbe W.E. Blood. 1996; 87: 781-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and gro-beta (CXCL2), and its truncated form, gro-beta-T are also involved in hematopoietic stem cell mobilization (28King A.G. Horowitz D. Dillon S.B. Levin R. Farese A.M. MacVittie T.J. Pelus L.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 1534-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29King A.G. Johanson K. Frey C.L. DeMarsh P.L. White J.R. McDevitt P. McNulty D. Balcarek J. Jonak Z.L. Bhatnagar P.K. Pelus L.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3774-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Stem cell mobilization is currently being investigated in MEF-deficient mice. MEF was recently reported to function as a transcriptional repressor of IL-8 promoter activity (18Seki Y. Suico M.A. Uto A. Hisatsune A. Shuto T. Isohama Y. Kai H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6579-6586PubMed Google Scholar); however, the same group showed that MEF induces lysozyme gene expression (30Kai H. Hisatsune A. Chihara T. Uto A. Kokusho A. Miyata T. Basbaum C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20098-20102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Suico M.A. Koyanagi T. Ise S. Lu Z. Hisatsune A. Seki Y. Shuto T. Isohama Y. Miyata T. Kai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The difference in our results may be the because of critical cell type-specific effects. Although many genes were induced by MEF in our assay, only three genes were repressed, suggesting that MEF most often serves to activate gene expression. Some transcription factors act as repressors or activators, depending on the specific promoter context (e.g. AML1 or NF-IL3/E4BP4) or specific cofactor associations. For example, AML1 associates with ETS proteins to activate the Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer (32Sun W. Graves B.J. Speck N.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4941-4949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but associates with corepressor molecules such as mSin3A to repress transcription of the p21 promoter (33Lutterbach B. Westendorf J.J. Linggi B. Isaac S. Seto E. Hiebert S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 651-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We have shown that MEF is bound to the IL-8 promoter in vivo and is a strong activator of IL-8 expression in hematopoietic cells. Although other ETS factors such as PEA3 may bind to the IL-8 promoter and regulate its expression in other contexts, MEF appears to play a most important role in regulating IL-8 production. The combined use of an inducible expression system with expression profiling represents a convergence of powerful techniques that allowed us to identify direct MEF transcriptional targets despite the significant overlap in ETS gene expression and the 3- or 4-nucleotide ETS binding recognition sequence (... GGA(A/T)...) present in innumerable locations throughout the genome.

Our model of the antibodycarbohydrate complex is consistent with binding data for several tested glycolipids as well as for a variety of 14F7 mutants with replaced VL domains. The interest in antibodies that specifically recognize tumor markers has revived during the last few years, boosted by the approval, in 1997, of the first monoclonal antibody for cancer treatment by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Today, a total of six antibodies have been approved by the FDA for the therapy of several types of malignancies, and dozens of different antibodies with potential therapeutic effects in cancer are in clinical trials. One attractive target antigen for cancer immunotherapy is the N-glycolyl GM3 ganglioside (1Malykh Y.N. Schauer R. Shaw L. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), a membrane-associated glycosphingolipid with a terminal N-glycolylated sialic acid residue (NeuGc). 1The abbreviations used are: NeuGc5′-N-glycolylneuraminidateFabantigen-binding fragments of immunoglobulinsCDRcomplementarity determining regionCLconstant light chainCHconstant heavy chainFvFab variable domainsGalgalactoseGlcglucosemAbmonoclonal antibodyNeuAc5′-N-acetylneuraminidatePDBProtein Data BankR.m.s.d.root mean square differencesr.s.c.c.real space correlation coefficientVLvariable light chainVHvariable heavy chainPEGpolyethylene glycolELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: NeuGc5′-N-glycolylneuraminidateFabantigen-binding fragments of immunoglobulinsCDRcomplementarity determining regionCLconstant light chainCHconstant heavy chainFvFab variable domainsGalgalactoseGlcglucosemAbmonoclonal antibodyNeuAc5′-N-acetylneuraminidatePDBProtein Data BankR.m.s.d.root mean square differencesr.s.c.c.real space correlation coefficientVLvariable light chainVHvariable heavy chainPEGpolyethylene glycolELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered saline. This tumor marker is expressed in certain tumor cells, such as melanoma and breast tumors (2Müthing J. Stener H. Peter-Katalinic J. Marx U. Bethke V. Neuman V. Lehmann J. J.

However, targeting N-glycolyl GM3 gangliosides is no easy task, as this glycosphingolipid shares common structural features with many other gangliosides expressed on the cell surface. In particular, N-glycolyl GM3 is highly similar to N-acetyl GM3, which is present in most human tissues. In fact, what should be targeted corresponds to an extremely subtle chemical modification: the difference between the N-glycolyl group in NeuGc and the N-acetyl group of NeuAc consists of the addition of a single oxygen atom to the N-acetyl moiety (CH2OH instead of CH3 in the context of a trisaccharide) (see Fig. 1). A murine monoclonal antibody (mAb), termed 14F7, that has this singular property has recently been described (5Carr A. Mullet A. Mazorra Z. Vázquez A.M. Alfonso M. Mesa C. Rengifo E. Pérez R.

Hybridomics. 2002; 21: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It exhibits high specificity toward N-glycolyl GM3 and strongly recognizes human melanoma and breast cancer tissues. 14F7 is quite unique, not only because of its binding specificity and rather strong binding affinity (in the nanomolar range) 2G.

Gavilondo, and E. Moreno, submitted manuscript. for N-glycolyl GM3, but also because of several other properties. In particular, 14F7 is an IgG antibody, belonging to the IgG1 subclass, whereas most other anti-ganglioside antibodies are IgMs, as a result of only a primary immune response to carbohydrate antigens (7Portoukalian J. Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 2000; 19: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in experiments carried out in mice, the 14F7 monoclonal antibody showed a remarkable inhibition of the growth of solid tumors (6Carr A. Mesa C. del Carmen Arango M. Vázquez A.M. Fernández L.E. Hybrid. Hybridomics. 2002; 21: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, a pilot clinical trial with radiolabeled 14F7 has been completed, with very encouraging results showing that this antibody is able to specifically target breast tumors and their metastases in vivo. 3A.

This is remarkable in the view of the more than 250 entries containing Fab structures that have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (18Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27319) Google Scholar). One of the possible reasons for this unbalance could be that carbohydrates in general are not very immunogenic, producing mostly low affinity antibody responses of the IgM isotype, as mentioned above. 14F7 is thus an exception to the rule, thanks to a successful immunization procedure (5Carr A. Mullet A. Mazorra Z. Vázquez A.M. Alfonso M. Mesa C. Rengifo E. Pérez R. Fernández L.E. Hybridoma. 2000; 19: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here, we report the crystal structure of the unliganded Fab fragment of 14F7 at 2.5 Å resolution. This structure provided the starting point for computer docking studies with the saccharide moiety of N- glycolyl GM3, NeuGcα3Galβ4Glcβ. The resulting molecular model will provide a basis for further genetic manipulation of the binding site to improve tumor targeting. Fab 14F7 was prepared from purified mAb using papain digestion. Digestion time, temperature, and papain: mAb ratio were optimized following the progressive degradation of the 50 kDa heavy chain band on a 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. A 3 mg/ml mAb solution in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm cysteine, 10 mm EDTA was incubated with papain (1:100 papain:mAb ratio) at 37 °C for 4h. Enzymatic digestion was stopped with 20 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) and loaded on a protein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) to retain the Fc and undigested mAb, while the flow-through contained the Fab. The Fab fraction was then dialyzed extensively against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. For further purification, the Fab solution was loaded on a Mono Q 5/5 ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and the isoforms (presumably produced by cleavage on secondary proteolytic sites during papain digestion) were separated with a shallow linear gradient obtained by mixing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, over a period of 100 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The main peak was collected and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a 10 kDa cut-off disposable ultrafiltration device (Millipore). Initial crystallization experiments from a mixture of Fab 14F7 isoforms were unsuccessful, but once the purification protocol was significantly improved, crystals could be obtained readily within 20 min to a few days, provided that the protein solution was freshly prepared. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop technique at room temperature. The crystallization conditions were rather broad, with the precipitant of choice being PEG (ranging from PEG 400 to PEG 8000), buffered at pH 7.0 to 9.0, with or without the addition of various salts as additives. The crystal shapes varied from plates to rods and needles. Crystals from many conditions were tested for diffraction and all of them were isomorphous. The space group was P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 52.5 Å, b = 78.9 Å, c = 121.9 Å, corresponding to a Matthews coefficient, VM, of 2.5 Å3/dalton (40Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7917) Google Scholar) with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Two crystals were used for final data collection. Both of them grew in droplets formed by a 1:1 mixture of the protein solution (10 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.8) and the reservoir solution, containing 15% PEG 400 and 100 mm Hepes buffer at pH 7.0. Data collection was performed at BL711 at the MAX-lab II synchrotron in Lund, Sweden, on a MAR CCD detector. Since shock-freezing of the crystals in a nitrogen stream resulted in strongly anisotropic diffraction, we decided to collect data at room temperature, exposing five different spots on the same crystal, a long needle. To achieve higher completeness and redundancy, a second crystal was used (data collection at 10 °C). All available data to 2.5 Å resolution were processed and scaled with XDS (19Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 67-71Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 20Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 21Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Series A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar), using the Fab coordinates PDB 1C5C as the search model. The sequence was corrected, and the model was subjected to rigid body refinement with four separate rigid domains [light chain constant (CL)/variable (VL) domains and heavy chain constant (CH)/variable (VH) domains] followed by simulated annealing (23Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brünger A.T. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Six percent of all reflections were used for the test set (24Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3860) Google Scholar). Thereafter, positional and temperature factor refinement with CNS (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) were alternated with molecular rebuilding (program O, (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar)) in several rounds. Water molecules were placed at peak positions of σa-weighted Fo - Fc maps and 2Fo - Fc maps greater than 3σ and 1σ, respectively, and checked at the graphics display. 37 water molecules are included in the final model. Refinement results are summarized in Table I. The structure was validated against composite annealed omit maps from CNS. In a Ramachandran plot (27Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. Biophys. J. 1965; 5: 909-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) produced by PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), 87.0% of the residues are located in the most favored regions of the plot and 12.2% are in the additional allowed regions. Two residues are in generously allowed regions and, finally, one residue, Ala L51, is in a disallowed region, slightly outside a generously allowed region. L51 is positioned in a γ-turn in complementarity-determining region loop 2 (CDR L2) and is found in a similar place of the Ramachandran plot in many reported Fab structures. The real space correlation coefficient (r.s.c.c.) for this residue against a composite annealed omit map is 75%. The sequences for the constant domains have not been determined, but were taken from the Kabat data base (29Johnson G. Wu T.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 205-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (www.kabatdatabase.com/). The sequence for H187–H188 was first chosen as Pro-Arg, however, the electron density clearly indicated that H188 must be a tryptophan. An examination of the sequence data base revealed that Trp H188 is always accompanied by a threonine residue at H187. The real space correlation coefficients for these two residues are 93% (Thr H187) and 87% (Trp H188). Here, we use the Kabat numbering scheme for the variable regions, which for this particular antibody introduced insertion letters in the heavy chain sequence after positions 52 (52A), 82 (82A to 82C), and 100 (100A to 100H). Preparation of Protein and Ligand—The crystal structure of the 14F7 Fab fragment was taken as the starting geometry for dynamics and docking simulations. The CL and CH1 constant domains and all water molecules were removed, thus leaving only the Fab variable domains (Fv) for calculations. Energy minimizations and dynamics simulations were performed using the program CHARMM, version 24 (30Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13939) Google Scholar). Both polar and non-polar hydrogen atoms were added to the protein and, subsequently, an energy minimization was carried out in three steps, in order to refine the stereochemistry. First, harmonic constraints of 50 kcal/mol/Å2 were applied to all α carbons during 100 steps of a steepest descent geometry relaxation. Thereafter, a similar cycle was performed with the constraints reduced to 10 kcal/mol/Å2. Finally, the harmonic constraints were removed to perform 500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. A distance dependent dielectric constant (ϵ = 8r) and a 12 Å cutoff distance were used for non-bonded interactions. The terminal disaccharide moiety of N-glycolyl GM3 (NeuGcα3Galβ) used in the docking procedure was built using the program CHARMM, based on topology files included in the Quanta2000 package (Accelrys Inc.). As for the protein receptor, all hydrogens were explicitly included. The third carbohydrate residue, 4Glcβ1, was added after docking of the disaccharide since it does not participate in any protein interactions. Glycosidic dihedral angles are defined as described in Refs. 31Imberty A. Delage M.-M. Bourne Y. Cambillau C. Pérez S. Glycoconj. J. 1991; 8: 456-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Siebert H.-C. Reuter G. Schauer R. von der Lieth C.-W. Dabrowski J.

Conformational Sampling in the Binding Site Region using Molecular Dynamics—Molecular dynamics was employed to explore the conformational space of the receptor binding site, using the energy-minimized structure as starting geometry. Most of the amino acids in the complementarity determining regions and several other neighboring residues were allowed to move. It should be noted that conformational sampling was not restricted to the side chains, but also included the backbone atoms. The structure was initially heated from 0 to 300 K during 6 ps and equilibrated at this final temperature during another 12 ps. Thereafter followed a 1000-ps simulation with a 0.001-ps integration step. The SHAKE algorithm as implemented in CHARMM was used to constrain bonds to hydrogens. The same non-bonding parameters as for energy minimization were applied. Coordinates were collected every 500 steps (0.5 ps), so that at the end, 2000 coordinate frames were stored in a trajectory file. These coordinate frames were subsequently clustered using an r.m.s.d. cutoff of 1 Å. Docking Simulations of the 14F7-NeuGc-GM3 Complex—Docking simulations were performed employing a modified version of the program DOCK 3.5 (34Kuntz I. Science. 1992; 257: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 35Gschwend D.A. Kunz I.D. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Design. 1996; 10: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) called DOCKdyna. 4E. Moreno, to be published. This program allows the screening of a large number (thousands) of receptor conformations for binding of a single ligand, by using a novel and automatic way of representing the receptor binding site (36Moreno E. León K. Proteins. 2002; 47: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and re-calculating the force field grids used for energy evaluation for every receptor coordinate frame. Ligand flexibility was allowed. The top-ranking solutions within a scoring window of 6 kcal/mol were selected from the output and grouped into clusters, using a cutoff r.m.s.d. value of 1.5 Å, as calculated only for ring atoms of the sugar. Thereafter, the best ranking solutions, one from each cluster, were selected for visual inspection and analysis. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Modeling studies indicated that Asp H52 plays a crucial role in the binding of NeuGc-GM3. In order to probe the role of this residue for the molecular recognition of the saccharide ligand, two primers were designed, targeting the 14F7 residue Asp H52 for site-directed mutagenesis. One primer was used to mutate Asp H52 to Val (DH52V), the other one for mutation to Ile (DH52I). The substitutions were performed in the phage-displayed VL-shuffled single chain antibody fragment 3Fm (cloned in the phagemid vector pHG-1m, Heber Biotec, Cuba) derived from 14F7, which retained the original VH region and exhibits equal binding characteristics as the original 14F7 monoclonal antibody.2 The reason for using a single chain Fv with a different VL domain is that we could not obtain an Fv fragment with the original VH sequence of 14F7, probably due to expression problems in bacteria. Purified plasmid DNA from 3Fm was used as template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification reactions. The first reaction was performed using each mutation-containing forward primer and a single backward primer that anneals to the 5′-region of the phagemid vector pHG1–1m flanking the inserted antibody fragment. PCR conditions were: 50 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C (30 cycles). The mutations were thus introduced in the 5′-region of 3Fm. Amplification products were purified using PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega) and used to prime a second round of PCR reactions (using the same conditions) together with a single forward primer that anneals to the 3′-region of the phagemid vector flanking the inserted antibody fragment. Again, 3Fm plasmid DNA was used as template. Full-length antibody fragment DNA sequences containing the mutations were obtained. Purified PCR products were sequentially digested with ApaL I and NotI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into the same phagemid vector. Ligation reactions were electroporated separately (DH52V and DH52I) in TG1 electro-competent cells. Cells were grown overnight in 2× TY-agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. Sequencing of Selected Clones—DNA from selected clones was purified using Midi Preps™ kit (Promega). Sequencing was performed with an automated DNA sequencer ALF Express II (Amersham Biosciences) using primers corresponding both to the 5′ and 3′ vector sequences flanking the antibody fragment. Screening of Phage-displayed Antibody Fragments—Phage particles exposing antibody fragments were rescued from the mutant clones with helper phage M13 K07 on a 50-ml scale and purified from the bacterial supernatant through precipitation with 20% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 2.5 m NaCl (37Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity of phage-displayed antibody fragments was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates (Costar, USA) were dried with N-glycolyl GM3 (1 μg/well) in methanol. Plates were washed with PBS and blocked with 2% skimmed milk powder in PBS (M-PBS) during 1 h at room temperature. Phage displaying antibody fragments were diluted in M-PBS (1010 particles/ml) and incubated on the plates for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing the plates with PBS plus Tween 20 0.1% (PBS-T), an anti-M13 mAb coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), appropriately diluted in M-PBS, was added to the wells. The plates were washed again and the substrate solution (500 μg/ml orthophenylendiamine and 0.015% hydrogen peroxide in 100 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.5) was added. The reaction was stopped after 15 min with 2.0 m sulfuric acid. The absorbance (492 nm) was determined with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Each sample was tested twice for the binding of N-glycolyl GM3. The 3Fm clone was included as a positive control for N-glycolyl GM3 recognition. Figures and Tables—Fig. 1 was prepared using ChemDraw from CambridgeSoft and Fig. 2 using Quanta2000/CHARMm27 modeling package from Accelrys Inc. Crystal Structure of Fab 14F7—The crystal structure of the 14F7 Fab fragment was determined at 2.5 Å resolution and refined to crystallographic R-factors of 18.1% (Rcryst) and 23.8% (Rfree), respectively, with good stereochemistry. The electron density is very well defined for a 2.5 Å structure (average r.s.c.c. for composite annealed omit map is 86%), due to the good data quality. Only a few regions in the structure are less well defined. In particular, the C-terminal residues L213-L214 and H216-H219 from the light chain and the heavy chain, respectively, could not be located in the electron density maps. For the heavy chain loop H128-H133, there is some discontinuous density, but not good enough for this loop to be correctly traced. Many Fab structures deposited in the protein data base lack this particular loop. Further, due to weak electron density for their side chains, Lys H13 and Lys H64 were modeled as alanines and Cys H215 was substituted by a glycine residue. Overall, the crystal structure of Fab 14F7 is highly similar to other Fab structures, with one noticeable variation. The complementarity determining region CDR H3 of 14F7 (residues 95–102 with eight letter insertions at 100), is among the longest found both in the Kabat data base and in the PDB, with 16 amino acid residues (see Table II). This long loop protrudes from the middle of the antibody-combining region, dividing the binding site into two well-separated zones that we will refer to as the VL and VH subsites (Fig. 2A).Table IISequence alignment of the CDR H3 loop of 14F7 compared to all other carbohydrate-binding antibodies present in the Protein Data Bank The Kabat numbering scheme is used.

Here we report that in addition to its anti-receptor activity, SU1498 stimulates accumulation of phosphorylated ERKs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and in human aortic endothelial cells in a manner that is dependent on the functioning of the upstream components of the MAPK pathway, B-Raf, and MEK kinases. The enhanced accumulation of phospho-ERKs is observed only in cells that have been stimulated with sphingosine 1-phosphate or protein growth factors; SU1498 by itself is ineffective. We show that the inhibitor acts by blocking the kinase activity of phospho-ERK both in a direct assay and in immunoprecipitates from cells treated with the compound.

Endothelial cells are an integral component of vasculature, and their ability to sense extracellular stimuli is an essential feature of the angiogenic response (1Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3490) Google Scholar). To the extent that this response can be mimicked in vitro, it consists of cell migration (chemotaxis) and morphological differentiation leading to assembly of a network of tubes (resembling capillaries); these phenomena are induced by factors such as VEGF 1The abbreviations used are: VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorKDRVEGF receptor 2HUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellERK1/2extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2MAPmitogen-activated proteinMAPKMAP kinaseMEKMAPK kinasePKAcyclic AMP-dependent protein kinasePKCprotein kinase CSPPsphingosine 1-phosphateSU1498KDR inhibitorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorPDGFRPDGF receptorAG1296PDGFR inhibitorAG1433PDGF/KDR receptor inhibitorEGFepidermal growth factorPD153053EGF receptor inhibitorH89PKA inhibitorPD98059MEK inhibitorPD169316p38 protein kinase inhibitorGö6983inhibitor of PKC α, β1, β2 isoformsSU6656inhibitor of tyrosine protein kinases of the Src familybFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorHGFhepatocyte growth factorPBSphosphate-buffered salineP-phosphorylated. or a bioactive phospholipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP). The cells possess specific receptors that bind and process these factors: the tyrosine kinase receptors for VEGF (Flt1 or VEGF receptor 1 and KDR or VEGF receptor 2), and the members of the endothelial differentiation gene family of G protein-coupled receptors for SPP, in particular EDG-1 or S1P1 (2Gille H.

Interestingly, SPP-treated cells exhibit an enhanced level of KDR phosphorylation (4Tanimoto T. Jin Z.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42997-43001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), indicating that the two types of receptors communicate with each other in addition to signaling through the pathways specific to themselves. Similarly, in vascular smooth muscle cells, SPP promotes PDGF receptor phosphorylation (5Boguslawski G. Grogg J.R. Welch Z. Ciechanowicz S. Sliva D. Kovala A. McGlynn P. Brindley D. Rhoades R.

Receptor activation has profound consequences on cell fate, resulting as it does in activation of diverse pathways both proliferative and those leading to differentiation or apoptosis (8Blume-Jensen P.

These pathways include the MAP kinase cascades, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent cascades, and receptor protein-tyrosine kinase cascades, with significant overlaps between them (10Galetic I.

We have been interested in the biochemical mechanisms influencing the ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to migrate and form capillaries in the presence of VEGF and other stimuli. We observed that compounds purported to be specific blockers of the VEGF receptor, KDR, substantially inhibited responses to SPP as well as to HGF and basic FGF (bFGF). This suggested that these factors induce migration and tube formation through a common pathway or intermediate(s). Because the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MAP kinase pathways in migratory reactivity of a variety of cells is well documented (20Brahmbhatt A.A. Klemke R.L. J. Biol.

Cell Cultures—HUVECs were obtained from VEC Technologies, Inc. (Rensselaer, NY) and grown to no more than passage 10 in RPMI 1640- or DMEM-based medium containing endothelial cell growth supplement (30 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), heparin sulfate (2 units/ml), 25 mm glucose, 20 mml-glutamine, antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml; streptomycin, 100 μg/ml; amphotericin B, 0.25 μg/ml), and 20% fetal bovine serum. When necessary cells were starved in the same medium containing 0.5% serum. Chemotaxis and tube formation assays were carried out as described previously (31Boguslawski G. Lyons D. Harvey K. Kovala A.T. English D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Human aortic endothelial cells were obtained from Cambrex Bio Science (Walkersville, MD) and were grown in appropriate cell media (bullet kits) provided with the cells. Human aortic smooth muscle cells were also obtained from Cambrex Bio Science and were grown in a medium containing DMEM, 25 mm glucose, 20 mml-glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Materials—Media components were from Invitrogen and from Cambrex Bio Science. Culture flasks and plates and Transwell chemotactic chambers and filters were purchased from Fisher. Precast polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresis buffers, and nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Invitrogen, and Western blocking reagent was from Roche Applied Science. Chemicals and Antibodies—Sphingosine 1-phosphate was from Sigma and the various inhibitors used in this study, including SU1498, H89, and the Raf-1 kinase inhibitor, were obtained from Calbiochem. Growth factor-reduced Matrigel was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). Protein growth factors, VEGF, PDGF-BB, EGF, HGF, bFGF were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-ERK1/2, and antiphospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA) as was the p44/p42 MAP kinase assay kit that included activated murine ERK2. Human activated ERK1 was purchased from Calbiochem. Mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Corp. (Santa Cruz, CA). Preparation of Cell Lysates, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Cells grown in plates or flasks were serum-starved as indicated and rinsed with PBS. After the treatments, the cells were lysed with the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2-7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.125% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 2 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium pervanadate, aprotinin (20 μg/ml), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were mixed with one-fourth the volume of the 4× electrophoresis sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 1% mercaptoethanol, heated 5 min at 99 °C, and stored at -80 °C until use. Samples of the lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 10% Western blocking reagent in Trisbuffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, and probed with the appropriate antibodies. The signal was detected using goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates and the ECL-Plus chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Staining—HUVECs (20,000-100,000 cells) were plated in the chambers of Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge-Nunc, Napperville, IL) and incubated overnight in 2 ml of standard medium. The cells were then starved overnight, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with PBS and overlaid with 0.8 ml of DMEM. Compounds under study were added, and chambers were held at room temperature for the duration of treatment (see Fig. 6). Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 2 ml of cold 3% paraformaldehyde, and washed 3 times with PBS. The fixed cells were “blocked” for 30 min at 4 °C with 5% Western blocking reagent in PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and washed once with PBS. Next, each chamber received 150 μl of a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK antibody (1:100 dilution) in blocking solution, and the slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After removing the unbound antibody by rinsing with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, the cells were treated in the dark with 150 μl of a 10-fold-diluted secondary antibody (goat F(ab′)2 IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)) for 1 h at room temperature. Stained cells were washed with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS and secured with coverslips sealed with Gel/Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Images were obtained with the aid of a digital camera mounted on a Leitz DMBR fluorescence microscope and connected to a computer equipped with Spot Advance software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). ERK Activity Assays—A kit from Cell Signaling was used for this purpose. This kit included the kinase buffer, ATP, and an active form of ERK2 kinase and its protein substrate, Elk1, whose phosphorylation was detected with anti-phospho-Elk1 antibody. In the direct assay the active ERK1 or ERK2 was diluted to 1 ng/μl with the kinase buffer without ATP. Separately, the Elk1 protein was diluted to 20 μg/ml with the kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP. The ERK1 or ERK2 solution was pipetted into tubes (1 μl per tube) and mixed with 0-10 μl of 50 μm SU1498 (in kinase buffer without ATP). The blank tube received buffer only. The volume was adjusted to 11 μl with the same buffer, and the mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. This was followed by the addition of 40 μl of the Elk1-ATP-buffer solution, and the incubations were continued for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped with 20 μlof4× sample buffer mix and heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples (15 μl) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated Elk1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Elk1 antibody. The immunoprecipitation assay was performed essentially as instructed by the manufacturer. HUVECs were grown in T150 culture flasks (2 × 106 cells per flask) and starved overnight. The medium was siphoned off, and the cells were washed with PBS and overlaid with 4 ml of DMEM. SU1498 was added to selected flasks for 15 min followed by SPP (1 μm) or VEGF (100 ng/ml). A control flask was left untreated. After a 10-min incubation the cells were lysed with 0.8 ml of lysis buffer provided with the kit, and clear supernatants were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. Each supernatant received a 15-μl aliquot of immobilized anti-P-ERK antibody, and the suspensions were incubated with gentle agitation overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were suspended in 50 μl of the kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk1 protein. The mixtures were incubated 30 min at 30 °C, and the reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 4× sample buffer. Samples (15 μl) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated Elk1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Elk1 antibody. Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Inhibitors Interfere with HUVEC Migration and Tube Formation in Response to SPP or VEGF— Receptor-mediated chemotactic and morphogenetic responses to bioactive lipids and protein growth factors are essential to the angiogenic process. With this in mind we examined the effect of several receptor inhibitors on cell migration and capillary network formation. Each inhibitor was able to block chemotaxis to both SPP and VEGF (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the same inhibitors diminished assembly of tube networks that the cells produced in response to SPP and several angiogenic growth factors (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, despite the reported absence of PDGFR in endothelial cells (32Bergers G. Song S. Meyer-Morse N. Bergsland E. Hanahan D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 33Sano H. Ueda Y. Takakura N. Takemura G. Doi T. Kataoka H. Murayama T. Xu Y. Sudo T. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S. Fujiwara H.

Brain Res. 2003; 113: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the PDGF receptor inhibitor AG1296 inhibited migration profoundly, albeit at a high concentration; it also affected tube formation induced by factors unrelated to PDGF. SU1498-treated Endothelial Cells Accumulate Phosphorylated ERK1/2—The above results suggested that the inhibitors that we used might exert their effect not only at the level of receptors but also at some point(s) downstream in the signaling pathway(s). We considered the possibility that the inhibitors might act to prevent phosphorylation of MAP kinases or Akt/protein kinase B, thereby inactivating a major signaling component of the cell. Surprisingly, this was not the case. Even though the levels of phosphorylated Akt remained low regardless of treatment, there was a dramatic upward shift in phospho-ERK1/2 accumulation. As shown in Fig. 2, HUVECs exposed to the inhibitors responded strongly to SU1498 and AG1296 (KDR and PDGFR inhibitors, respectively) but weakly or not at all to AG1433 or PD153035 (KDR/PDGFR and EGFR inhibitors, respectively). Given the fact that endothelial cells do not express a PDGF receptor, it is not clear why AG1296 would have such an effect, whereas AG1433 (up to 25 μm concentration, see Fig. 4) was ineffective. It is of note, however, that compounds structurally very similar to SU1498 (such as AG555) or AG1296 (such as AG1295), induced no such response. 2G. Boguslawski, unpublished data. We have chosen SU1498 for further study because it had the most effect, regardless of the growth factor used.Fig. 4Known inhibitors of signaling pathways interfere with the stimulation of ERK phosphorylation by SU1498. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were grown in 6-well plates and starved as described above. In A individual compounds were added for 15 min: SU1498, 10 μm; AG1433, 10 or 25 μm; PD169316, 10 μm; PD98059, 10 μm; forskolin (FSK), 10 μm; bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM), 1 μm; wortmannin (Wor), 1 μm. In B the same inhibitors alone or in combinations were tested in the presence of 1 μm SPP or VEGF (100 ng/ml). Where combined with SU1498, the inhibitors were added 15 min beforehand, to be followed by SU1498 for 15 min, and then the cells were stimulated for 10 min with SPP or VEGF. In C additional compounds were tested as indicated (Gö6983 (Gen), 5 μm; SU6656, 2 μm; okadaic acid (OA), 10 nm), alone or in combination with 10 μm SU1498 followed by SPP or VEGF. In D the response of human aortic endothelial cells to SU1498 was similarly tested using HGF (100 ng/ml) or SPP (1 μm). H89 was used at the 10-μm level. NT, no treatment. In E human smooth muscle cells were stimulated with SPP or PDGF in the presence or the absence of SU1498. All reactions were terminated with lysis buffer and analyzed for phospho-ERK accumulation by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SU1498 Acts in a Dose-dependent Fashion and Stimulates Time-dependent Accumulation of Phospho-ERK1/2—Initial experiments demonstrated that the SU1498-dependent buildup of phospho-ERK required the presence of SPP or VEGF (Figs. 3 and 4). The accumulation was dependent on the length of exposure to these stimuli (Fig. 3A), but prolonged incubation with the inhibitor resulted in cell death and decrease of recoverable phospho-ERK (Fig. 3B). We have also determined that the extent of ERK phosphorylation correlated with the concentration of SU1498, reaching a maximum at the 10 μm concentration of the compound and decreasing at higher concentrations (Fig. 3C). SU1498-induced ERK Phosphorylation Requires the Activity of Signaling Pathways—To gain insight into the manner in which SU1498 exerts its influence, we examined the consequences of blocking the activity of MEK, p38 kinase, PKA, and PKC on the accumulation of phospho-ERK1/2. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, the various compounds, used individually, had no appreciable effect on the level of detectable phospho-ERK1/2, forskolin being the only exception. Again, even though neither SPP nor VEGF by themselves elicited a strong P-ERK1/2 response, the presence of these stimuli was essential for SU1498-mediated accumulation (Fig. 4B). This accumulation as well as that stimulated by forskolin was completely abolished when the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, was present; thus, ERK phosphorylation proceeds through the well established MAP kinase signaling pathway. Also intriguing was the fact that PD169316, a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase, interfered strongly with ERK phosphorylation stimulated by SU1498. Although the manner in which p38 kinase may participate in ERK activation in HUVECs is not well understood, the observed effect is consistent with cross-talk between the ERK and p38 kinase pathways (35Sharma G.D. He J. Bazan H.E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21989-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We note that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatase PP2A, was without effect (Fig. 4C). Neither 2 μm SU6656, an Src family kinase inhibitor (36Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Courtneidge S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), nor 20 μm genistein, a less-specific protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had any effect on SU1498 action; however, PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I, a broad spectrum PKC inhibitor (1 μm) and Gö6983 (5 μm) abolished SU1498-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Therefore, the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK does not appear to be dependent on tyrosine kinases but requires protein kinase C. We extended these observations to two additional cell lines, human aortic endothelial cells and human aortic smooth muscle cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, the response of human aortic endothelial cells to treatment with SU1498 was exactly the same as that seen with HUVECs, the inhibitor potentiating the accumulation of phospho-ERKs in cells stimulated with SPP or HGF. However, smooth muscle cells did not exhibit an increase in phosphorylated ERKs, perhaps because of the high basal level of P-ERK1/2 in these cells (Fig. 4E) or because of a difference in the manner human aortic smooth muscle cells regulate ERK activity (see “Discussion”). The observation that forskolin, an inducer of adenylyl cyclase, stimulated ERK phosphorylation (Figs. 2 and 4) implied the involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in the activation of MAPK pathway in HUVECs. We tested this further with the help of H89, a commonly used inhibitor of PKA (37Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As is apparent from Figs. 4D and 5, the addition of H89 caused a substantial decrease in the extent of ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have noted that a Raf-1 kinase inhibitor not only did not inhibit but actually enhanced phospho-ERK accumulation, an effect strongly counteracted by H89. These results coupled with insensitivity to wortmannin and to Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicate that HUVECs utilize the PKA-dependent B-Raf kinase in preference to Raf-1 kinase to phosphorylate MEK and ERK (38Vossler M.R.

SU1498 Has No Effect on Nuclear Localization of ERK1/2— Phosphorylation of ERKs results in the movement of a fraction of the kinase pool to the nucleus, where the kinases activate a number of transcription factors including c-Fos, c-Jun, and Elk1 (41Horgan A.M.

We used anti-phospho-ERK antibody binding followed by decoration of the complex with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody to examine the effect of SU1498 on nuclear translocation of phosphorylated ERKs in HUVECs (Fig. 6). Cells were manipulated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed for fluorescence. We noted that even the unstimulated cells showed a significant amount of phosphorylated ERKs in the nuclei. It is not known whether this indicates a high basal activity of the MAPK pathway in HUVECs. Consistent with the weak stimulation of ERKs by SPP and VEGF, the nuclei of cells treated with these agents alone showed only slightly enhanced staining with antiphospho-ERK antibody. We did not observe much difference when SU1498 was present except that some of the fluorescent nuclei appeared grainier, with a punctate pattern readily apparent. Formation of phospho-ERK aggregates has been reported in neuronal cells treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (44Zhu J.-H. Kulich S.M. Oury T.D. Chu C.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 2087-2098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but we do not know if the grains we observe are analogous to those aggregates. We conclude that SU1498 does not substantially affect nuclear translocation of phospho-ERKs. SU1498 Inhibits ERK Activity—Functionality of MAPKs is generally controlled by their phosphorylation state (11English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp.

Therefore, it is possible that SU1498 inhibits a phosphatase, thereby preventing ERK dephosphorylation and leading to accumulation of phospho-ERK.

Here we show that Apomine reduced the levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, both in rat liver and in cultured cells. Apomine resembles sterols such as 25-hydroxycholesterol in its ability to potently accelerate the rate of HMGR degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a process that depends on the transmembrane domain of the enzyme. The similarity between Apomine and sterols in promoting rapid HMGR degradation extends to its acute requirements for ongoing protein synthesis and mevalonate-derived non-sterol product(s) as a co-regulator. Yet, at suboptimal concentrations, sterols potentiated the effect of Apomine in stimulating HMGR degradation, indicating that these agents act via distinct modes. Furthermore, unlike sterols, Apomine inhibited the activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase in intact cells but not in cell-free extracts. Apomine stimulated the cleavage of the precursor of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-2 and increased the activity of low density lipoprotein receptor pathway. This Apomine-enhanced activation of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-2 was prevented by sterols or mevalonate.

Cholesterol uptake is regulated through modulating the levels of the cell surface low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; LDLR, LDL receptor; ACAT, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FCS, fetal calf serum; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; HMGal, a fusion protein between the membrane domain of HMGR and β-galactosidase; LPDS, lipoprotein-deficient serum; MVA, mevalonate; SRE, sterol-regulatory element; SREBP, sterol-regulatory element-binding protein; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. receptor (LDLR), and cholesterol synthesis is regulated primarily by changes in levels and activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar, 2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). HMGR is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA into mevalonate (MVA), the first committed step in the MVA pathway that leads to the synthesis of cholesterol as well as of essential non-sterol isoprenoid compounds (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar, 2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). When cells are starved for cholesterol and/or MVA, levels of HMGR and LDLR are elevated, thus increasing the rate of endogenous sterol synthesis and of LDL uptake (3Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Kaneko I. Endo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Goldstein J.L. Helgeson J.A.S. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5403-5409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, in cholesterol-replete cells, the levels of HMGR and LDLR decline, thereby lowering sterol production and LDL internalization. HMGR and LDLR are regulated at the transcriptional level by sterol-regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoter of their genes (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar, 5Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Specific transcription factors, designated SRE-binding proteins (SREBPs), bind to these elements and activate transcription (5Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 6Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The SREBP family comprises three members that control different sets of genes. SREBP-2 regulates the transcription of genes mainly involved in sterol synthesis, whereas SREBP-1a and -1c regulate principally fatty acid biosynthetic genes (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). The nuclear, transcriptionally active SREBPs are derived from the NH2-terminal domain of large ER membrane-bound precursors through sequential proteolytic cleavage by the two Golgi proteases, Site-1 protease and Site-2 protease (8Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In sterol-depleted cells, the membrane SREBP precursors are transported by vesicles to the Golgi where cleavage occurs, generating soluble transcription factors that enter the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes (9Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). When sterols are abundant, or when cells are treated with potent hydroxylated forms of cholesterol such as 25-hydroxycholesterol, the voyage of the SREBP precursors from the ER to the Golgi is prevented (9Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and consequently the levels of the nuclear SREBPs decrease (12Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36431-36437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and transcription of SRE-controlled genes declines. The SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a polytopic ER protein with sterol-sensing domain, plays a critical role in SREBP activation as it escorts the SREBP precursors from the ER to the Golgi in sterol-depleted cells (13Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 14Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the presence of sterols, the SCAP·SREBP complex is retained in the ER through binding of SCAP to resident ER membrane proteins Insig-1 and/or Insig-2, thus preventing SREBPs from reaching the compartment where the cleaving proteases reside (16Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 17Yabe D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This is the feedback mechanism by which sterols are believed to regulate transcription of SRE-controlled genes. Sterols and MVA-derived non-sterol products regulate HMGR levels also at the posttranslational level by controlling the rate of degradation of the enzyme (18Faust J.R. Luskey K.L. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5205-5209Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Chin D.J. Gil G. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Luskey K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cells that have been depleted of cholesterol and/or MVA, HMGR is quite stable, but when cells are supplemented with sterols, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol, or with excess MVA, the enzyme is rapidly degraded (20Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conditional degradation of HMGR appears to be carried out by an otherwise constitutive quality control process known as ER-associated degradation, which eliminates aberrant proteins in the secretory pathway (22Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 23Hampton R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 345-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar to other ER-associated degradation substrates, HMGR is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, HMGR sets a special example for a normal ER membrane protein that is tagged by multiubiquitin chains and degraded by the proteasome in a metabolically regulated manner (23Hampton R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 345-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Ravid T. Doolman R. Avner R. Harats D. Roitelman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35840-35847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The structural element in HMGR that confers the regulated turnover is its multispan membrane-embedded portion (25Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), which, like SCAP, also contains a sterol-sensing domain (13Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). When grafted onto other proteins, such as β-galactosidase, this transmembrane domain endows the resulting fusion protein, HMGal, with both ER localization and metabolically controlled degradation (26Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4236-4246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hampton R.Y. Koning A. Wright R. Rine J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that Insig-1 is also crucial for the sterol-regulated degradation of HMGR (29Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The central role of the MVA pathway in normal and pathological cell physiology has been demonstrated in multiple studies in which MVA production was blocked by a class of HMGR competitive inhibitors collectively known as statins. The inhibition by statins of endogenous cholesterol synthesis and the resulting increase in LDLR expression have been exploited to lower plasma cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemia. However, there is a growing body of evidence that statins possess pleiotropic effects, which appear to be unrelated to their hypocholesterolemic activity. Therefore, new indications for the use of statins have been suggested, including treatment of osteoporosis (30Mundy G. Garrett R. Harris S. Chan J. Chen D. Rossini G. Boyce B. Zhao M. Gutierrez G. Science. 1999; 286: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar) and Alzheimer's disease (31Wolozin B. Kellman W. Ruosseau P. Celesia G.G. Siegel G. Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), although the efficacy of statins in the treatment of such conditions has not been demonstrated. It is well accepted that statins mainly target the liver and are poorly bioavailable systemically when given orally. Furthermore experiments in animal models, as well as clinical studies in humans, have shown that systemic exposure of tissues other than liver to this class of HMGR inhibitors results in a significant toxicity. Thus, although the MVA pathway appears to hold a great potential as a target for multiple pharmacological interventions, attempts to develop new classes of drugs that impair HMGR activity by decreasing HMGR mRNA or by increasing the degradation rate of the enzyme have not been exploited. We discovered a new class of synthetic hypocholesterolemic compounds, the 1,1-bisphosphonate esters, that are not competitive inhibitors of HMGR. A representative of this class of compounds, SR-12813, has been shown to inhibit the MVA pathway in HepG2 cells by increasing the rate of HMGR degradation (54Berkhout T.A. Simon H.M. Patel D.D. Bentzen C. Niesor E. Jackson B. Suckling K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14376-14382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The resulting decrease in cholesterol synthesis, which was also observed in vivo in dogs that were orally administered with SR-12813, leads to hypocholesterolemia. A more potent analogue, SR-45023A (Apomine™, see Fig. 1), is currently under clinical trials. Here we investigate the mechanism(s) by which Apomine exerts its hypocholesterolemic activity and show that it increases the rate of HMGR degradation in cultured cells and decreases HMGR levels in rat liver. Comparative studies reveal that the mechanism by which Apomine leads to the decrease in HMGR protein levels resembles the one displayed by 25-hydroxycholesterol. However, unlike 25-hydroxycholesterol but similar to Simvastatin, Apomine induces cleavage of SREBP-2 and increases LDL receptor expression. Our results provide a molecular mechanism for the hypocholesterolemic activity of Apomine. Materials—Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. Mevalonolactone (Fluka) was converted to the sodium salt. 25-Hydroxycholesterol was purchased from Steraloids, and immobilized recombinant Protein A was obtained from RepliGen. Micro-BCA protein reagent and SuperSignal® chemiluminescent substrate were from Pierce. MG-132 was purchased from Calbiochem. [1-14C]Acetic acid (CFA.13) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and Expre 35S35S 35S-protein labeling mixture (NEG-072), [9,10-3H]oleic acid (NET-289), and [oleoyl-1-14C]-oleoyl coenzyme A (NEC-651A) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum (LPDS, d ≥ 1.25) and human LDL (d 1.019-1.063) were prepared by ultracentrifugation, and 125I-LDL was prepared as described previously (32Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Lovastatin and zaragozic acid were kindly provided by Merck Research Laboratories. Simvastatin used for in vivo experiments was given as Zocor, 80 mg (MSD, Glattbrugg, Switzerland). Simvastatin used for in vitro experiments was from LKT Laboratories Inc. (St. Paul, MN). Compactin was a generous gift from R. Simoni, Stanford University. Apomine (SR-45023A, tetraisopropyl 2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) ethyl-1,1-diphosphonate, Ref. 33Nguyen, L. M., Niesor, E. J., Phan, H. T., Maechler, P., and Bentzen, C. L. (1991) U. S. Patent 5,043,330Google Scholar) was synthesized by the Department of Chemical Sciences, Ilex Oncology Research Sarl, Versoix, Switzerland. Antibodies—HMGR and HMGal were immunoprecipitated with specific antiserum directed against the membrane domain of HMGR (34Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and HMGR was detected by immunoblotting using mouse A9 monoclonal antibody (35Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 522-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, HMGal was immunoprecipitated with an anti β-galactosidase antibody (Promega). Mouse IgG-1C6 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) was used in immunoblotting analysis of SREBP-2. Polyubiquitin conjugates were detected with a monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (clone P4D1). Horseradish peroxidase coupled to goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Cells—All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified incubator. CHO cells were grown in Medium A (minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). LP-90 cells (36Ravid T. Avner R. Polak-Charcon S. Faust J.R. Roitelman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29341-29351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were kept in Medium B (Medium A in which LPDS was substituted for FCS and also supplemented with 90 μm lovastatin). UT2-HMGal cells were generated through stable transfection of UT2 cells (37Mosley S.T. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13875-13881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with pHMGal-Neo plasmid (36Ravid T. Avner R. Polak-Charcon S. Faust J.R. Roitelman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29341-29351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in Medium A supplemented with 0.2 mm MVA and 250 μg/ml Geneticin. To up-regulate expression of HMGR and LDLR, the cells were grown for 16-20 h in LPDS medium (in which LPDS was substituted for FCS and which was also supplemented with 2 μm compactin and 100 μm MVA). HeLa cells were grown in Hepes-buffered high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. These cells were up-regulated by omitting the serum from their growth medium. Where indicated, sterols were added in ethanol to final concentrations of 2 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 20 μg/ml cholesterol, and MVA was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. Apomine was dissolved in Me2SO/ethanol (1:1, v/v). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—On day 1, 8 × 105 CHO cells were plated in Medium A in 60-mm dishes. On day 2, cells were refed with LPDS-containing medium supplemented with 2 μm compactin and 100 μm MVA. On day 3, the cells were starved for 1 h in 1 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free minimal essential medium containing 5% LPDS, 2 μm compactin, and 100 μm MVA. The cells were then pulse-labeled for 30 min with 100-150 μCi of protein labeling mixture and chased in LPDS medium supplemented with 2 mm methionine and the indicated additions. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies as described previously (21Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by 5-15% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting—Proteins were electroblotted onto Optitran BAS-83 reinforced nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), and the membranes were probed with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. Measurement of Acyl-CoA:Cholesterol Acyltransferase (ACAT) Activity—ACAT activity in cultured cells was assayed, with minor modifications, as described in Ref. 38Chang C.C. Doolittle G.M. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar. Briefly, on day 1, CHO or HeLa cells were plated in 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and up-regulated on day 2 as described above. On day 3, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were refed with 1 ml of fresh medium into which 2 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 20 μg/ml cholesterol (in ethanol) or 80 μg/ml LDL were added in the absence or presence of 1 μm Apomine. After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, [3H]oleate (complexed to bovine serum albumin) was added to a final concentration of 100 μm (40,000 dpm/nmol), and the cells were labeled for an additional 2 h. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and extracted twice with 2 ml of hexane/isopropanol (3:2, v/v). After addition of unlabeled cholesteryl oleate as a carrier, the pooled extracts were dried under N2. Lipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography on plastic-backed silica gel plates using petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v) as the solvent system. The spot containing cholesteryl oleate (RF, 0.8) was cut out and counted by liquid scintillation. To measure ACAT activity in cell-free extracts, on day 1 cells were plated at a density of 4 × 106/100-mm dishes in their respective FCS-containing media. The media were changed 2 h before the cells were harvested on day 2. Cell extracts were prepared by the hypotonic shock and scraping method (39Chang T.Y. Limanek J.S. Chang C.C. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and were adjusted to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Assay tubes consisted of 120 μl of 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 containing ∼200 μg of protein and 100 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA complexed to bovine serum albumin (∼8,000 dpm/nmol). Tested compounds dissolved in Me2SO/ethanol (1:1, v/v) were added directly to the assay mixtures such that solvent concentrations did not exceed 1%. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and reactions were terminated by adding 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and unlabeled cholesteryl oleate as a carrier. After addition of 1 ml of water, phases were separated by low speed centrifugation. The organic phase was evaporated under N2, and lipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography as described above. Degradation of 125I-LDL—On day 1, 1 × 105 CHO cells were plated in 24-well dishes in Medium A. On day 2, cells were refed with LPDS medium in the absence or presence of sterols (2 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 20 μg/ml cholesterol) or 1 μm Apomine. On day 3, quadruplicate wells received 125I-LDL at 10 μg/ml (250-650 cpm/ng) in the absence or presence of 400 μg/ml unlabeled LDL. Following incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, the amount of trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I radioactivity was determined as described previously (32Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Animal Experiments—Male Wistar rats (230-270 g, Charles River Iffa-Credo, L'Arbresle, France) were housed in groups of four animals/cage and subjected to a cycle of 12 h of light and 12 h of dark. All animals were fed standard diet (UAR AO3). Treatment was administered by oral gavage. The animals were anesthetized with 60 mg/kg intraperitoneal pentobarbital (Vetanarcol, Veterinaria, Zürich, Switzerland) and sacrificed. Liver samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 °C until analysis. Frozen tissues were rapidly homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science)) using an Ultraturax device. The lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 7,000 × g, and the supernatants were analyzed for HMGR by immunoblotting. Miscellaneous Methods—HMGal activity was measured by the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside in digitonin-permeabilized cells as described previously (26Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was measured with the micro-BCA reagent from Pierce or by the Folin phenol method (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apomine Accelerates the Degradation of HMGR—The structure of Apomine is shown in Fig. 1. Since previous studies have demonstrated that Apomine treatment leads to hypocholesterolemia in animals (41Jackson B. Gee A.N. Guyon-Gellin Y. Niesor E. Bentzen C. Kerns W.D. Suckling K.E. Arzneim.-Forsch. 2000; 50: 380-386PubMed Google Scholar), we examined its effect on HMGR levels in rat liver. Rats were treated with Simvastatin or with vehicle for 4 days and then given a single dose of Apomine. Five hours later, liver homogenates were prepared, and HMGR levels were analyzed and quantified by immunoblotting with anti-HMGR monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, Simvastatin drastically elevated the levels of the enzyme (>530%) when compared with vehicle-treated rats. Apomine treatment decreased HMGR levels by 22%. Remarkably a single dose of Apomine nearly halved the elevated levels of HMGR in Simvastatin-treated animals, lowering it by 45% (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that the effect of Apomine on HMGR levels is recapitulated in cultured cells. HeLa cells were treated for 5 h with increasing concentrations of Apomine, and the levels of HMGR in equal amounts of total cell protein were assessed. As shown, Apomine caused a dose-dependent decrease in HMGR levels with an estimated IC50 of ∼100 nm (Fig. 2B). Next we tested whether this decrease in HMGR resulted from alterations in the enzyme stability (Fig. 2C). To this end, we used the lovastatin-resistant LP-90 cells, which overproduce HMGR but normally control its levels through regulated turnover (36Ravid T. Avner R. Polak-Charcon S. Faust J.R. Roitelman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29341-29351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were pulse-labeled with 35S-labeled amino acids and chased for the indicated times in the absence or presence of sterols or increasing concentrations of Apomine. As shown, Apomine shortened the half-life of HMGR in LP-90 cells in a dose-dependent manner with an estimated IC50 of ∼10 nm. The maximal effect of 5-fold accelerated HMGR degradation was attained at 100 nm Apomine, similar to the stimulation achieved by saturating amounts of sterols (Fig. 2C). We also examined the effect of Apomine in untransfected CHO cells or in UT2 cells that were stably transfected with HMGal, a fusion protein composed of the membrane domain of HMGR and bacterial β-galactosidase (26Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). As assessed by pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation, Apomine accelerated the degradation of HMGR in CHO cells and of HMGal in UT2 cells (Fig. 2D, inset). Increased degradation rate of HMGal was also evident by its enzymatic activity, which decreased in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent IC50 of ≈250 nm Apomine (Fig. 2D). A nearly maximal effect was achieved at 1 μm, and a 90% decline in activity was observed at 5 μm Apomine. For comparison, only a ∼60% decrease in HMGal activity was achieved by a mixture of sterols containing the same concentration of 25-hydroxycholesterol (2 μg/ml, ∼5 μm). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Apomine resembles sterols in its ability to accelerate the degradation of HMGR by a process that is directly mediated through the transmembrane domain of the enzyme and neither requires the catalytic domain nor the enzymatic activity of reductase. Consistent with the rapid loss of HMGR protein and activity from the cells, Apomine inhibited the synthesis of cholesterol from [14C]acetate, similar to the effect observed in cells treated with Simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMGR (Table I).Table IApomine inhibits cholesterol synthesis On day 1, HeLa cells were plated in a 6-well dish (7 × 105/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. On day 2, the cells were up-regulated by omitting serum from the growth medium for 16 h. On day 3, triplicate wells were treated for 3 h with Apomine or Simvastatin at the indicated concentrations and then labeled for 2 h with 5 μCi/well [14C]acetate. Following washes in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were dissolved in 10% ethanolic KOH. Non-saponifiable lipids were extracted with petroleum ether and separated by thin layer chromatography using chloroform/acetone (95:5, v/v) as the solvent system.

Acetyl-β-methylcholine (MCh) decreased Cav 1.2c currents, did not affect 2.1 or 2.2 currents, but potentiated Cav 2.3 currents.

Quadruple Ser → Ala mutation of the predicted MCh sites in the α1 2.3 subunit (Ser-888, Ser-892, and Ser-894 in the II–III linker and Ser-1987 in the C terminus) caused loss of the MCh response but not the PMA response.

Electrophysiological and pharmacological characterizations have determined that α1 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 subunits encode L-type channels; α1 2.1 encodes P/Q-type channels; α1 2.2 encodes N-type channels; α1 2.3 encodes R-type channels; and α1 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 encode T-type Cav channels (1Jones S.

The intracellular segments of the α1 subunit, namely the N and C termini and the intracellular loops between domains I and II, II and III, and III and IV, possess the binding/recognition sites for second messengers such as G protein βγ subunits or intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) as well as sites that can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) (4Stea A.

Members of the Cav family are variably influenced by agents that activate PKC. For example, Cav 1.2a (rabbit heart) currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes were potentiated by the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (8Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N.

In contrast, Cav 1.2c (rat brain and human heart) currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes were not influenced by PMA (11Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M.

Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Presumably, phosphorylation of certain amino acids alters the gating of channels, leading to greater currents. The sensitivity of Cav channels to PMA suggests that some of these channels may represent potential targets for certain hormones, neurotransmitters, and agonists that activate PKC by a receptor-mediated pathway. For example, stimulation of the odd numbered (M1, M3, and M5) muscarinic receptors results in the activation of PKC (14Caulfield M. Birdsall N. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 279-290PubMed Google Scholar). Differential results were obtained when Xenopus oocytes coexpressing M1 receptors and Cav 1.2c or Cav 2.3 channels were exposed to MCh. Cav 1.2c currents were decreased by MCh (15Kamatchi G. Durieux M. Lynch C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 981-990PubMed Google Scholar), but Cav 2.3 currents were potentiated, possibly due to M1 receptor-induced activation of PKC (13Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Chan C. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PKC isozymes can be divided into three categories: classic PKCs or cPKCs, including PKC α, βI, βII, and γ isozymes that require Ca and are stimulated by phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol (DAG); novel or nPKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), which are Ca-independent but still stimulated by phosphatidylserine and DAG; and atypical or aPKCs (ξ, λ/ι), which are Ca- and DAG-independent. In a recent study, we suggested that cPKCs may be responsible for the action of MCh, whereas nPKCs may contribute to the action of PMA (13Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Chan C. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Unique cPKC- and nPKC-selective phosphorylation sites may be present in the α1 2.3 subunit. Here we have compared currents among Cav 1.2c, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes also expressing M1 receptors. Cav 1.2c currents were decreased by MCh (15Kamatchi G. Durieux M. Lynch C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 981-990PubMed Google Scholar) but unaffected by PMA. Neither MCh nor PMA affected 2.1 currents. Cav 2.2 and 2.3 currents were potentiated by PMA, but MCh increased only 2.3 currents, as shown before (13Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Chan C. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Durieux M. Lynch C.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 360-369PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the comparison of amino acid sequences in the channel types, we have mutated unique potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in the α1 2.3 subunit to alanine and coexpressed the mutants with M1 receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Specific MCh-sensitive sites have, thus, been identified. Construction of Mutants—Selected serines or threonines were mutated to alanines by using overlap extension PCR mutagenesis with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutations were used to extend the template, the wild type rat brain α1 2.3 subunit cDNA subcloned in the pMT2 vector. The PCR product was treated with DpnI, a restriction enzyme specific for methylated and hemimethylated DNA to digest the template DNA. The digested PCR product was transformed in Escherichia coli using the protocol from the supplier, and the DNA from the selected transformants was processed for sequencing. The whole coding region of the construct was sequenced (Biomolecular Research Facility, University of Virginia) to confirm the planned mutation and the absence of unwarranted mutations contributed by the PCR reaction. Harvesting of Oocytes and cDNA Injection—Mature female Xenopus laevis frogs were obtained from Xenopus I (Ann Arbor, MI), housed in an established frog colony, and fed regular frog brittle on alternate days. For the removal of oocytes, a frog was anesthetized in 500 ml of 0.2% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in water until unresponsive to a painful stimulus. The anesthetized frog was placed supine on ice, and an incision of ∼1.5 cm in length was made through both the skin and muscle layers of one lower abdominal quadrant. A section of the ovary was exteriorized and a lobule of oocytes (∼500) was removed. The wound was closed in two layers, and the animal was allowed to recover from anesthesia, kept in a separate tank overnight, and returned to the colony the following day. The oocytes were washed twice in calcium-free OR2 solution (in millimolar: NaCl 82.5, KCl 2, MgCl2 1.8, HEPES 5, pH 7.5) and transferred to OR2 solution containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (type 1A, Sigma). The dish containing the oocytes in collagenase solution was agitated for a period of 2–3 h at room temperature to remove the follicular cell layer. Defolliculation was confirmed by microscopic examination. Following this, the oocytes were washed in OR2 solution and transferred to modified Barth's solution (in millimolar: NaCl 88, KCl 1, NaHCO3 2.4, CaCl2 0.41, MgSO4 0.82, HEPES 15, pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 10 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. The oocytes were allowed to recover by incubation at 16 °C for 3–10 h before cDNA injection. Nuclear (germinal vesicle) injection was performed (Drummond “Nanoject,” Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA) using a maximum of 4 ng of cDNA containing 3 ng of a 1:1:1 mix (molar ratio) of Cav α1, β1B, α2/δ cDNA subunits and 1 ng of rat M1 receptor cDNA in pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The oocytes were returned to Barth's solution and incubated at 16 °C for 6–8 days before the recording of current. Current Recording—Macroscopic currents, with Ba2+ (IBa) as the charge carrier, were recorded employing a two-electrode voltage-clamp technique using Oocyte Clamp OC-725C (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). The amplifier was linked to an interface and an IBM-PC-compatible computer equipped with pClamp software (version 8.2, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) for data acquisition and analysis. Leak currents were subtracted using the P/4 procedure. Microelectrodes with an agarose cushion were filled with 3 m CsCl; typical resistances were 0.5–2.5 mΩ. KCl-Agar bridges were used as ground electrodes to minimize any junction potential attributable to changes in ionic composition of the bath solution. The oocytes were placed in a recording chamber (∼500-μl volume) superfused with the recording solution containing (in millimolar): Ba(OH)2 40, NaOH 50, KOH 2, HEPES 5, using methanesulfonate as the anion to adjust the pH to 7.4. Niflumic acid (0.4 mm) was included to block intrinsic Cl channels. Oocytes were held at –80 mV before being depolarized to the test potential. A test potential of 0 mV for a duration of 850 ms was employed in oocytes expressing any Cav channel except Cav 2.2 channels. The same protocol was used for the depolarization of Cav 2.2 channels, except that the test potential was 20 mV. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship of oocytes expressing the wild type Cav 2.3 channel or a quadruple mutant were determined. The I-V was recorded for a duration of 450 ms using step depolarizations from –50 mV to 100 mV in 10-mV increments. Drug Treatment—All of the oocytes exhibiting IBa greater than 400 nA underwent control, treatment, and wash protocols. The control IBa was recorded at the 8th min after the oocyte was impaled. MCh was used to activate M1 receptors. Wherever necessary, the effect of PMA also was tested in oocytes coexpressing M1 receptors. MCh or PMA was perfused for 60 s, and the current was recorded after another 60 s, thus exposing the oocyte to the agonist for a period of 2 min. Chemicals—PMA (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and MCh (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO (0.1%) and distilled water, respectively. MCh and PMA were prepared as concentrated stock solutions and stored frozen at –20 °C. They were diluted to their final concentration in recording solution on the day of the experiment. To block endogenous Cl– currents, niflumic acid (Sigma) was added to the recording solution, which was stirred overnight for it to dissolve. Data Analysis—The data are shown as means ± S.E., unless otherwise indicated. The peak represented the maximum amplitude of the inward current. The current amplitude at 830 ms (of the total period of 850 ms) was arbitrarily defined as the late current, which was used as a measure of relative degree of channel inactivation. The current inactivation rate was fit by a single exponential function using the equation,y=A*exp(-t/τ)+C(Eq. 1) where A is the coefficient of the exponential, t is time (ms), τ is the time constant (ms), and C is the fraction of residual current. Statistical significance was determined using paired or unpaired t test and p < 0.05 was considered significant. MCh or PMA Differentially Affect Various Cav Channels Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—Currents in oocytes expressing various Cav channels were examined with either 1 μm MCh, the EC50 for MCh observed in our recent study (13Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Chan C. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), or PMA (100 nm). PMA failed to affect Cav 1.2c currents (percent change: peak current = –1.1 ± 1.5; late current –2.6 ± 1.2; mean ± S.E., n = 4) significantly. Similarly Cav 2.1 currents (percent change: peak current = 0.9 ± 0.5; late current 1.9 ± 5.8; mean ± S.E., n = 5) were also unaffected by PMA. Under the same conditions, PMA potentiated Cav 2.2 (percent change: peak current = 37.2 ± 5.4; late current 99.9 ± 28.9; mean ± S.E., n = 7) (Fig. 1) and Cav 2.3 currents (see Figs. 1 and 4) significantly.Fig. 4Effect of MCh (1 μm) or PMA (100 nm) on the Cav 2.3 currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes with the wild type or the quadruple S888A/S892A/S894A/S1987A mutant of the α1 2.3 subunit. The currents were coexpressed with α12.3β1Bα2/δ subunits and M1 receptors.

Cav 1.2c currents were significantly decreased (percent change: peak current = –39.0 ± 6.0; late current –56.0 ± 8.0; mean ± S.E., n = 5) as shown before (15Kamatchi G. Durieux M. Lynch C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 981-990PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Cav 2.1 (percent change: peak current = 7.9 ± 3.7; late current 3.6 ± 11.0; mean ± S.E., n = 4) and Cav 2.2 currents (percent change: peak current = 16.5 ± 6.2; late current 15.4 ± 7.7; mean ± S.E., n = 4) were not affected by MCh. Cav 2.3 currents were increased by MCh (see Figs. 2 and 4). Selection of Possible Phosphorylation Sites—Intracellular regions (a total of thirteen regions) of the α1 2.3 subunit that could be expected to have access to PKC were examined for potential phosphorylation sites. The sites were selected based on the existence of (a) linear sequence motifs fitting a PKC substrate, (b) sequence differences between the channel subtypes, (c) sites in regions of the channels that are known to possess some regulatory functions, and (d) potential sites fitting a possible helical motif for PKC recognition. There is some evidence that the PKC site in neuromodulin is recognized as an α-helix rather than as a linear sequence (17Vinton B. Wertz S. Jacob J. Steere J. Grisham C. Cafiso D. Sando J. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We identified nine serine/threonine sites in the α1 2.3 subunit (Fig. 3). Four potential phosphorylation sites (Ser-888, Ser-892, and Ser-894 in the II–III linker and Ser-1987 in the C terminus) are unique to the α1 2.3 subunit and are considered potential receptor-mediated (M1) PKC phosphorylation sites, because, among the members of the Cav 2.0 family, only Cav 2.3 currents were potentiated by MCh application. The other five sites are homologous to the five potential PKC phosphorylation sites we noted in the α1 2.2 subunit. This second set of potential phosphorylation sites was considered potentially PMA-selective, because both Cav 2.2 and 2.3 currents were potentiated by PMA. Ser → Ala Substitution of Predicted MCh-selective Serine Residues Inhibits MCh-induced Potentiation of Peak and Late IBa through Cav 2.3 Channels—The predicted potential MCh-selective sites of the α1 2.3 subunit were subjected to mutational analysis. As a first step, a quadruple mutant was constructed by substituting Ser with Ala at all of the predicted potential MCh-selective sites, i.e. S888A/S892A/S894A/S1987A. Oocytes expressing the quadruple mutant or the wild type cDNA were studied in parallel, and the currents were analyzed. The IBa peaked between –10 and 10 mV in both the wild type (at 81.9 ± 1.08 ms; mean ± S.E., n = 14) and the quadruple mutant (at 80.3 ± 1.3 ms; mean ± S.E., n = 6). Analysis of the I-V plot revealed that the IBa appeared at –30 mV in both the wild type and the quadruple mutant; the IBa reversed between 50 and 70 mV in the wild type and between 50 and 90 mV in the quadruple mutant. The kinetic properties of the current from the oocytes expressing the quadruple mutation (S888A/S892A/S894A/S1987A) were compared with those of the wild type Cav 2.3 current. IBa through the wild type (inactivating current (A1) = 626 ± 60 nA (80.1 ± 1.4% of total current), τ = 147 ± 12 ms and non-inactivating current (R) = 93 ± 10 nA; mean ± S.E.; n = 14) and the quadruple mutant (A1 = 1447 ± 246 nA (79.7 ± 1.4% of total current), τ = 140 ± 4 ms and r = 245 ± 53; n = 6) channels showed similar monoexponential inactivation. Although MCh or PMA potentiated the wild type IBa, differential results were observed with these agents in the oocytes expressing the quadruple mutation S888A/S892A/S894A/S1987A. MCh-induced potentiation of both the peak and the late IBa was significantly decreased in S888A/S892A/S894A/S1987A compared with the wild type. In contrast, the PMA-induced increase in the IBa was not affected significantly in the quadruple mutation (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table I).Table ISummary of MCh or PMA effects on the Cav 2.3 WT or Ala mutant channels888/892/894Ser/Ala at 1987% Increase (current)MCh (1 μm)nPMA (100 nm)nPeakLatePeakLate%%SerSerSerSer49 ± 2104 ± 511674 ± 6181 ± 2120AlaAlaAlaAla22 ± 7ap < 0.001; bp < 0.01; cp < 0.05, compared to the respective control; t test.19 ± 20cp < 0.001; bp < 0.01; cp < 0.05, compared to the respective control; t test.674 ± 10210 ± 398AlaAlaAlaSer14 ± 7ap < 0.001; bp < 0.01; cp < 0.05, compared to the respective control; t test.31 ± 16bp < 0.001; bp < 0.01; cp < 0.05, compared to the respective control; t test.7AlaSerSerSer55 ± 5195 ± 584SerAlaSerSer52 ± 10131 ± 225SerSerAlaSer51 ± 8103 ± 139AlaAlaSerSer54 ± 10120 ± 258AlaSerAlaSer50 ± 682 ± 105SerAlaAlaSer65 ± 6138 ± 187SerSerSerAla62 ± 20110 ± 227AlaSerSerAla49 ± 5111 ± 238SerAlaSerAla8 ± 3ap < 0.001; bp < 0.01; cp < 0.05, compared to the respective control; t test.16 ± 10ap < 0.001; bp < 0.01; cp < 0.05, compared to the respective control; t test.13SerSerAlaAla47 ± 687 ± 136AlaAlaSerAla26 ± 7bp < 0.001; bp < 0.01; cp < 0.05, compared to the respective control; t test.55 ± 14cp < 0.001; bp < 0.01; cp < 0.05, compared to the respective control; t test.7AlaSerAlaAla41 ± 4164 ± 4112SerAlaAlaAla41 ± 5104 ± 169a p < 0.001; bp < 0.01; cp < 0.05, compared to the respective control; t test. Open table in a new tab To determine the relative contribution of the II–III linker serine residues to the MCh response, the triple mutant (S888A/S892A/S894A), three double mutants (S888A/S892A, S888A/S894A, and S892A/S894A), and three single (S888A, S892A, S894A) mutations were constructed. As observed with the quadruple mutation, the MCh-induced increase in the current was significantly inhibited in oocytes expressing the triple mutant S888A/S892A/S894A (Fig. 5). In contrast, none of the single or double mutations of the II–III linker serine residues significantly affected the MCh response when compared with their respective controls (Fig. 6, A and B, and Table I).Fig. 6Summary of the effect of MCh (1 μm) on the Cav 2.3 currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes with the wild type or the single (S888A, S892A, S894A) or double mutation (S888A/S892A, S888A/S894A, S892A/S894A) of II–III linker serine residues of α1 2.3 subunit.

S → A substitution of Ser-1987 failed to affect the MCh response; similarly, S1987A in combination with S888A or S894A also failed to affect the MCh response significantly. However, S1987A in combination with S892A significantly inhibited the effect of MCh (Fig. 7). It appears that both Ser-888 and Ser-894 together, present in the double mutant S892A/S1987A, were not sufficient for the action of MCh. Ser-888, Ser-892, and Ser-894 May Contribute Differently in the Action of MCh—It appears that one serine residue of the II–III linker region is sufficient for the action of MCh, because any double mutation (S888A/S892A, S888A/S894A, or S892A/S894A) of II–III linker serine residues failed to affect significantly the response to MCh (see Fig. 6B). However, in these double mutants, Ser-1987 in the C terminus was presumed to be available for MCh-induced modulation. Hence, the action of MCh was examined in triple mutants (S888A/S892A/S1987A, S888A/S894A/S1987A, and S892A/S894A/S1987A) that included any two serine residues of the II–III linker and Ser-1987. Application of MCh to the oocytes expressing these triple mutants led to differential results depending on the serine residue that was still available in these triple mutants. The response of MCh was significantly inhibited in the triple mutant S888A/S892A/S1987A. The availability of only Ser-894 in this triple mutant appears to be insufficient for the MCh response. In contrast, the effect of MCh was not significantly affected in the triple mutants, S888A/S894A/S1987A or S892A/S894A/S1987A (Fig. 8 and Table I). The intact MCh response in these triple mutants suggests that the availability of Ser-888 or Ser-892 in S892A/S894A/S1987A and S888A/S894A/S1987A, respectively, may be sufficient for MCh action. The importance played by the selected II–III linker serine residues in the potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents by MCh was analyzed further by mutating Ser-888, Ser-892, or Ser-894 to aspartate to mimic the negative charge of a phosphorylated residue. Ser → Asp substitution of Ser-888 and Ser-892 generated mutants that expressed Cav 2.3 currents, whereas S894D failed to express the current. In general, the basal IBa in the oocytes expressing these Ser → Asp substitutions was significantly larger than that of the respective wild type controls (Figs. 9A and 10A). This increase in the basal IBa was greater in S888D than in S892D. Coincident with this increase in the size of the basal current, the effect of MCh on both the peak and late IBa was decreased significantly in S888D. Only the late IBa was significantly decreased in the case of S892D (Fig. 9B). In parallel, we examined the effect of PMA in oocytes expressing the Ser → Asp substitution of II–III linker serine residues. In contrast to the generalized decrease in the MCh-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents in these Ser → Asp substitutions, the effect of PMA was intact in all of these aspartate mutants (Fig. 10B).Fig. 10Basal Cav 2.3 currents of the mutants S888D, S892D, S1987D, and S892D/S1987D of α1 2.3 subunit and the effect of PMA (100 nm) in Xenopus oocytes. The currents were coexpressed with α12.3β1Bα2/δ subunits and M1 receptors. The panels show the averaged peak and late currents in the wild type and the mutants with PMA treatment.

Ser → Asp substitution of Ser-1987 increased the basal peak current significantly; however, the effect of MCh was not affected (Fig. 9, A and B). There was a pronounced increase in the basal current in the double Ser → Asp substitution of S892D/S1987D (Figs. 9A and 10A) with a coincident decrease in the effect of MCh (Fig. 9B). However, the enhancement of current by PMA was not affected in S1987D or in S892D/S1987D (Fig. 10B). Differential Sensitivity of Cav Channels to Modulation Related to Various α1 Subunits—Different Cav currents vary in their responses to several hormones, neurotransmitters, and agonists that can activate PKC. The PKC activator PMA failed to modulate Cav 1.2c currents, whereas M1 receptor stimulation, which can activate PKC, decreased the currents through Cav 1.2c channels. Neither PMA nor M1 receptor activation modulated Cav 2.1 currents. In contrast, PMA and M1 receptor activation each potentiated Cav 2.3 currents, whereas Cav 2.2 currents were increased by PMA only (see Figs. 1 and 2). Because all of these Cav channels were expressed in the same oocyte expression system, the same PKC isozymes should be available in all cases. The selective action of MCh on the Cav 2.3 currents may be related to unique PKC sites in the Cav 2.3 channels. It is likely that the channel-specific effects of MCh or PMA observed here were contributed by the α1 subunit of these channels, because the auxiliary subunits (β1B and α2/δ) used in the expression of these channels were the same. Hence, the selective action of MCh on Cav 2.3 current may be due to the presence of unique phosphorylation sites in the α1 2.3 subunit. In agreement with this hypothesis, potential phosphorylation sites of Ser at 888, 892, 894, and 1987 were identified in the α1 2.3 subunit, and their quadruple mutation to Ala inhibited the effect of MCh but left the effect of PMA intact under the same conditions (Fig. 4). Potential PKC Sites in the II/III Linker of the α1 2.3 Subunit Are Required for Enhancement of Current by MCh—Serine sites unique to the II/III linker of the α1 2.3 subunit seem to be of critical importance for the MCh responsiveness of these channels. Triple Ser → Ala mutation of all three of these sites caused loss of the MCh response (see Fig. 5). The observation that double or single mutations in this region did not eliminate the response suggests that any one of the sites, Ser-888, Ser-892, or Ser-894, is sufficient for altered channel gating by M1 receptor activation (see Fig. 6). However, the sites are not equivalent. If Ser-1987 in the C terminus is mutated to Ala, the II–III linker sites Ser-888 or Ser-892 are still sufficient for the MCh response, but Ser-894 is not (see Fig. 8 and Table I). The basal current of the channel was significantly increased (at least 2-fold) following the Ser → Asp substitution of 888 or 892. In the face of this high basal activity, MCh caused less activation of the current, suggesting that the major effect of the Asp mutations was to enhance channel gating and opening rather than to increase channel expression. In the latter case, MCh stimulation similar to control would have been expected. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Cav 2.3 channel-specific response of MCh is mediated via these unique sites in the II/III linker. Several observations suggest that the MCh enhancement may be mediated via phosphorylation of the sites in the II/III linker: 1) The implicated sites were selected because they fit a PKC phosphorylation motif. 2) Replacement of the potentially phosphorylated Ser with Ala eliminates the MCh effect. 3) Single mutation of any of these sites to Asp (to mimic the negative charge of a phosphate) increases basal activity greatly, and there is less stimulation by MCh. 4) The MCh-induced increase in the Cav 2.3 currents was inhibited by PKC inhibitors (13Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Chan C. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ser-1987 in the C Terminus of the α1 2.3 Subunit Plays a Minor Role in the Enhancement by MCh—The lack of MCh enhancement, when Ser-1987 is available but when all the II/III linker serines were mutated to alanine (see Fig. 5), indicates that Ser-1987 is not sufficient for the MCh response. The presence of an intact MCh response in the Ser to Ala or Ser to Asp substitution of Ser-1987 (Figs. 7 and 9) indicates that Ser-1987 is not necessary for the MCh response. However, the presence of a serine at position 1987 could enable Ser-894 to serve as the sole available Ser site in the II–III linker (when residues 888 and 892 were mutated to Asp). When residue 1987 also was mutated to Ala, Ser-894 was insufficient alone and Ser-888 was insufficient in the presence of Ser-894. It is possible that Ser-888 and Ser-894 are incompatible when Ser-892 and Ser-1987 are mutated to Ala (see Fig. 7 and Table I). Attempts to make mutant α1 2.3 subunits with Ser → Asp substitutions at 894 were unsuccessful due to lack of expression of the mutant constructs (data not shown). Collectively, this information suggests that a constitutive negative charge at residue 894 may be detrimental for protein expression. Ser-892 seems to be capable of mediating MCh responsiveness independent of the availability of serine residues at the other sites examined. The Cav 2.3 II–III Linker Sites Are Not Required for Responsiveness to PMA—In contrast to MCh, PMA still increased the Cav 2.3 currents when potential PKC sites unique to Cav 2.3 channels (Ser-888, Ser-892, and Ser-894 in the II–III linker and Ser-1987 in the C terminus) were mutated to Ala (Fig. 4 and Table I) or to Asp (Fig. 10). The PMA responsiveness may be conferred by different sites such as Ser-369 in the I–II linker, Thr-879 in the II–III linker, and Ser-1995 and Ser-2011 in the C-terminal segment that are homologous to sites Thr-422, Ser-425, Thr-926, Ser-2108, and Ser-2132 in the PMA-responsive Cav 2.2 channels. Thr-422 and Ser-425 have been identified as PMA-responsive sites in the α1 subunit of Cav 2.2 channels (5Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S. Snutch T. Zamponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Non-selective PKC inhibitors (a PKC β pseudosubstrate and high concentrations of Ro-31-8425) blocked both PMA and MCh effects on Cav 2.3 channels suggesting involvement of PKCs in responses to both agonists (13Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Chan C. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, inhibitors more selective for calcium-dependent PKC isozymes (a PKCβ translocation inhibitor or low concentrations of Ro-31-8425) or agents that prevent release or action of intracellular calcium blocked only the MCh response (13Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Chan C. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that MCh activates calcium-dependent PKCs via phospholipase activation to generate diacylglycerol and release calcium from intracellular stores. These calcium-dependent PKCs may phosphorylate specifically the II–III linker sites unique to Cav 2.3 channels. PMA can bind to both cPKCs and nPKCs with much greater affinity than do diacylglycerols; but, because it does not generate directly an increase in intracellular calcium, this action may be inadequate to activate cPKCs. PMA alone may activate predominantly nPKCs. The Cav 2.3 channels contribute, along with Cav 2.1 and Cav 2.2 channels, to action potential-induced Ca influx in the central nervous system and at many peripheral synapses (18Artalejo C.R.

The II/III linker in Cav 2.1 and Cav 2.2 channels is a site of interaction with the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive attachment factor receptor proteins required for the release of neurotransmitters (22Rettig J.

Nature. 1996; 379: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Receptor-induced phosphorylation of the II/III linker in Cav 2.3 channels may provide a rapidly reversible mechanism for regulating just the Cav 2.3 channel subtype, either directly, by altering intramolecular interactions between channel domains to promote channel opening, or possibly via effects on interaction with other regulatory proteins (G proteins or channel subunits). Thus M1 receptor-mediated regulation of these II/III linker sites may contribute to regulation of neurotransmission in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. We are grateful to Dr. T. P.

Analysis of the interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 and its substrate, Lck, revealed that the active, membrane-proximal phosphatase domain of CD45 (CD45-D1) bound to the phosphorylated Lck kinase domain, the SH2 domain, and the unique N-terminal region of Lck. The second, inactive phosphatase domain (CD45-D2) bound only to the kinase domain of Lck. CD45-D2 was unable to bind phosphotyrosine, and its interaction with the kinase domain of Lck was independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. The binding of CD45-D2 was localized to subdomain X (SD10) of Lck. CD45-D2 bound similarly to Src family kinases but bound Csk to a lesser extent and did not bind significantly to the less related kinase, Erk1. CD45 dephosphorylated Lck and Src at similar rates but dephosphorylated Csk and Erk1 at lower rates. Replacement of Erk1 SD10 with that of Lck resulted in the binding of CD45-D2 and the conversion of Erk1 to a more efficient CD45 substrate.

They are necessary for the initiation of the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade, which is the earliest detectable event occurring upon TCR engagement (reviewed in Ref. 1Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Google Scholar). CD45 is thought to be required for T cell activation by constitutively dephosphorylating the negative regulatory tyrosine of Lck, Tyr505. This creates a “primed” Lck molecule that can become activated by autophosphorylation at Tyr394. Lck is thought to be activated upon TCR encounter with antigen, which then initiates the signal transduction cascade by phosphorylating downstream substrates such as CD3ζ and Zap-70 (reviewed in Refs. 1Chan A.C.

Like all members of the Src kinase family, Lck has a unique N-terminal region, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, an SH2 domain, a catalytic kinase domain and a short C-terminal region. Biochemical and structural evidence indicates that Src family members are regulated by an intramolecular interaction that occurs when the negative regulatory tyrosine in the C-terminal region is phosphorylated and interacts with the SH2 domain, resulting in a closed, inactive conformation (reviewed in Refs. 4Johnson P.

In contrast to the Src kinase family, very little is understood about how CD45 PTP activity is regulated or how substrate specificity is achieved. In the cytoplasmic domain of CD45, the membrane proximal PTP domain has been shown to be the active PTP domain, whereas most evidence indicates that the second PTP domain possesses no catalytic activity (10Streuli M.

CD45 activity, like Lck activity, may also be regulated by intra- and inter-molecular interactions (13Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar, 14Felberg J.

Therefore, Src family kinases appear to be the preferred substrates for CD45 in leukocytes, although CD3ζ, Zap-70, and Jak kinases have also been implicated as potential CD45 substrates (26Furukawa T.

Why Src family kinases are preferred substrates for CD45 or how the substrate specificity of CD45 is achieved at the molecular level is not well understood. To gain insight into these questions, we analyzed the enzyme-substrate interaction between CD45 and Lck using purified recombinant Lck and CD45 cytoplasmic domain proteins. We have determined that the second inactive PTP domain (CD45-D2) interacts with substrate and have identified a distinct region in the kinase domain of Lck, away from the catalytic site interaction, that is a docking site for CD45. The interaction of CD45 with this region was sufficient to promote substrate dephosphorylation, implicating a role for this region in substrate recognition and in contributing toward the determination of Lck as a preferred substrate for CD45.

The GST-Erk-Lck SD10 chimera, GST-Erk(L-SD10), was constructed by creating two silent mutations (StuI and XbaI) flanking the Erk1 SD10 region in pGEX-2T Erk1 by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GTGCTCCACCGAGATCTAAAGCCCTCCAACCTG-3′, 5′-TTTTTTCTCGAGGCCAGGGAAGATAGGCCTGTTAGAGAG-3′, 5′-AAAAAACTCGAGTCCAAAGCTCTAGACCTGCTGGACCGGATG-3′, and 5′-GAAGATGAGCTCCTTCAGCCGCTCCTTAGGTAG-3′.

Immobilized GST-Erk(L-SD10) was autophosphorylated by incubation of the purified fusion protein (0.2 μm) with 0.2 mm ATP prior to use in dephosphorylation assays. Recombinant His6-tagged murine CD45 cytoplasmic domain protein (6His-CD45) containing residues 565–1268 (numbered as in Ref. 42Thomas M.L. Reynolds P.J. Chain A. Ben-Neriah Y. Trowbridge I.S. Proc.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 302-309Google Scholar). The truncation mutant (6His-D1), encoding residues 565–927, containing the membrane proximal region, PTP-D1, and the spacer region, and 6His-D2 (residues 903–1268) containing part of the spacer region, PTP-D2, and the carboxyl tail were also as described (13Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar). A 6His-D2 protein (6His-D2-ΔAcidic) lacking the acidic region, residues 958–978, a GST-D2 protein (residues 903–1268) and a GST-D2 (GST-D2-ΔCT, residues 903–1190) lacking 78 amino acids from the carboxyl tail, were also constructed in pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences). D2 and D2-ΔCT were cleaved from GST by incubation overnight at 4 °C with Factor Xa (Roche Applied Science). Expression and purification of the His6-tagged and GST fusion proteins were as described (13Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assays of Immobilized GST Fusion Proteins with Soluble 6His-CD45 Proteins—Either equimolar amounts or equal amounts of protein (as indicated in each individual experiment) of soluble 6His-C817S, 6His-D2, or 6His-D1 were added to 2 μg of washed, immobilized GST fusion proteins (bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads). Immobilized GST alone or irrelevant GST fusion proteins were included as negative controls. The assays were incubated shaking for 2 h at 4 °C in 40 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol) with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). In 6His-D1 binding assays, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate was included in the buffer to inhibit PTP activity. After incubation, the samples were washed four times by adding 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol) and vortexing for 30–60 s. Reducing sample buffer was added, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp.), and the amount of added soluble protein remaining bound to the beads was detected by Western blot analysis with 1/5,000 anti-CD45 antiserum (R02.2) as the primary, and 1/10,000 horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled protein A (Bio-Rad) as the secondary. Membranes were subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the immobilized proteins and subjected to densitometry scan analysis using Alphaimager™ software (Alpha Innotech Corp.). In experiments where tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the immobilized proteins were determined, the samples were divided into two, and one membrane was probed with R02.2 and the other with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10, diluted 1/5,000 as the primary antibody and 1/10,000 dilution of HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody as the secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). Binding Assays Using Immobilized Phosphotyrosine and Soluble 6His-CD45 Proteins—O-Phospho-l-tyrosine (10 μmol) was covalently coupled to 1 ml of packed CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B beads according to manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 65% coupling efficiency was achieved. 1 μg of 6His-C817S or 6His-D2 (300 nm and 555 nm, respectively) were added to ∼1 mm phosphotyrosine bound to Sepharose CL-4B beads (2.5 μl beads) in 40 μl of binding buffer plus protease inhibitors. These were incubated and shaken for 2 h at 4 °C, then washed as described above. Reducing sample buffer was added, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-CD45 antibody (R02.2). Sepharose CL-4B beads were included as a negative control. Dephosphorylation Assays—These were performed at 30 °C in 10 μl of PTP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, with or without 0.01% Triton X-100) essentially as described (29Ng D.H.W. Jabali M.D. Maiti A. Borodchak P. Harder K. Brocker T. Malissen B. Jirik F.R. Johnson P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 867-876Google Scholar). 60 nm of purified recombinant 6His-CD45 was incubated with autophosphorylated recombinant GST fusion proteins: either (a) 245 nm GST-Lck or GST-Src or (b) 25 nm GST-Lck, 130 nm GST-Csk, and 380 nm GST-Erk1 or GST-Erk(L-SD10) for increasing amounts of time. The concentrations of the latter were determined by densitometric analysis using Alphaimager™ software to contain approximately equal levels of phosphotyrosine. The reactions were stopped by immersion in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membrane, and the amount of phosphorylated substrate remaining was determined by Western blot analysis. The tyrosine-phosphorylated bands were analyzed by densitometric analysis using Alphaimager™ software and subsequently graphed. The amount of tyrosine phosphorylation at time 0 was taken as 100% for all of the substrates. CD45-D1 Binds the Unique N-terminal, SH2, and Kinase Domains of Lck, Whereas CD45-D2 Binds Only the Kinase Domain of Lck—To analyze the interaction between CD45 and its substrate, Lck, we first determined which regions of the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 were interacting with the different regions of Lck. Purified, soluble, recombinant CD45 proteins, 6His-D1, 6His-D2, and 6His-C817S, were added to various immobilized GST-Lck domain proteins (Fig. 1), and a binding assay was performed (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The full-length, inactive CD45 cytoplasmic domain protein (6His-C817S) interacted with both the catalytic kinase domain of Lck, GST-kinase, and the non-catalytic portion of the protein, GST-N32 (Fig. 2A). 6His-C817S bound at low levels to GST-N and GST-SH2, but it did not bind to GST-SH3, as reported previously for inactive CD45 cytoplasmic domain protein (30Ng D.H.W. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1295-1300Google Scholar). The highest level of binding was observed between 6His-C817S and GST-kinase (Fig. 2A). 6His-D1 bound to the same regions of Lck as the full-length CD45 cytoplasmic domain protein, 6His-C817S, although less binding was observed to GST-kinase (Fig. 2B). This may be partly due to the inclusion of sodium orthovanadate in the 6His-D1 binding assays, added to inhibit 6His-D1 PTP activity. Attempts to make a catalytically inactive 6His-D1 recombinant protein did not result in sufficient protein for analysis. In contrast, the catalytically inactive 6His-D2 did not bind to any of the non-catalytic regions of Lck but bound significantly to GST-kinase (Fig. 2C). Even upon further exposure, no binding was observed between 6His-D2 and any of the non-catalytic domains above the background level. This indicates that the interaction between the enzyme, CD45, and the substrate, Lck, involves more than just the catalytic site of CD45 and the phosphorylated tyrosine of Lck. It implicates the non-catalytic regions of both CD45 and Lck in this interaction. In particular, it suggests that the second, non-catalytic PTP domain of CD45 is involved in binding substrate.Fig. 2Binding of His6-tagged CD45 cytoplasmic domain proteins to individual GST fusion Lck domain proteins. Equimolar amounts (300 nm) of 6His-C817S, 6His-D1, and 6His-D2 were added to 2 μg of GST-Lck proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in 40 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, reducing sample buffer added, and the samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The CD45 protein remaining bound to the GST-Lck proteins was detected by Western blot with anti-CD45 antiserum (R02.2; see “Experimental Procedures”). Immobilized Lck proteins are indicated above A. Negative controls are GST alone, GST, or an irrelevant GST fusion protein, GST+: GST-Grb2 for 6His-C817S and 6His-D2, and the GST-SHC SH2 domain for 6His-D1. Coomassie Blue staining of the membranes after Western blotting confirmed that approximately equal amounts of Lck protein was used in each condition (data not shown). A, 6His-C817S added to immobilized Lck domains. B, 6His-D1 added to Lck domains. 500 μm sodium orthovanadate was included in the buffer to inhibit PTP activity. C, 6His-D2 added to Lck domains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A comparison of equimolar amounts of 6His-D2 binding to Lck with the inactive CD45 cytoplasmic domain (6His-C817S) revealed that ∼5-fold less 6His-D2 bound compared with 6His-C817S (data not shown). This indicates that 6His-D2 can interact with full-length Lck. It also suggests that the binding of 6His-C817S to Lck might be a product of multiple interactions involving both the catalytic and non-catalytic regions of CD45. Binding of CD45-D2 to the Lck Kinase Domain Is Phosphorylation-independent and Does Not Require the Acidic Region or C-terminal Region of CD45-D2—Because 6His-D2 bound to the kinase domain of Lck and has significant sequence identity to active PTP domains, it was possible that the CD45-D2 PTP domain interacted with the phosphorylated tyrosines on Lck. To test this possibility, binding assays were performed between 6His-D2 and specific phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of the Lck kinase domain expressed as GST fusion proteins. In E. coli, the active Lck kinase domain is normally phosphorylated at the autophosphorylation site, Tyr394, as is a phosphorylation mutant where the negative regulatory tyrosine, Tyr505, has been mutated (Y505F). Mutation of Tyr394 (Y394F) prevents its autophosphorylation and co-expression of this construct with Csk (C-terminal Src kinase) promotes the phosphorylation at the negative regulatory site, Tyr505. Mutation of the catalytic lysine, Lys273, generates an inactive Lck mutant (K273R) that is not phosphorylated. Fig. 3A indicates that 6His-D2 bound to all Lck kinase domain proteins, irrespective of their tyrosine phosphorylation status (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3C confirms that equivalent amounts of GST-kinase domain proteins were used in each assay. The results show no significant difference in the binding of 6His-D2 to the various phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of the Lck kinase domain. To investigate whether the acidic region unique to CD45-D2 (residues 958–978) was involved in binding to the Lck kinase domain, a 6His-D2 protein lacking the acidic region, 6His-D2-ΔAcidic, was made and purified. Equimolar amounts of 6His-D2 and 6His-D2-ΔAcidic were compared in their ability to bind to the GST-kinase phosphorylation mutants. As can be seen in the right panel of Fig. 3, the binding of CD45-D2 to the Lck kinase domain did not require the acidic region. In fact, more 6His-D2-ΔAcidic bound to the kinase domain than 6His-D2, suggesting that the acidic residues have a negative effect on binding. The binding of 6His-D2-ΔAcidic is also independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the Lck kinase domain. To determine if the C-terminal 78 amino acids of CD45-D2 were involved in binding to Lck, a GST-D2 protein lacking these amino acids, GST-D2ΔCT, was made. Both GST-D2 and GST-D2ΔCT were cleaved with factor Xa from GST and used in a binding assay with immobilized GST-Lck. The C-terminal deletion of 78 amino acids did not have any significant effect on the binding of CD45-D2 to Lck (data not shown). Therefore, the C-terminal region and the unique acidic region are not required for CD45-D2 to bind to Lck, indicating that the interaction with Lck is mediated by amino acid residues close to or within the D2 PTP domain. CD45-D2 Does Not Bind Phosphotyrosine—The phosphorylation-independent binding of 6His-D2 to the differentially phosphorylated GST-kinase domain proteins suggested that CD45-D2 may not be binding to Lck via its proposed catalytic pocket, or if it is, the highly substituted CD45-D2 catalytic pocket may not bind to phosphotyrosine. To investigate whether CD45-D2 can bind tyrosine phosphate, phosphotyrosine was immobilized to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B beads and soluble 6His-D2 or 6His-C817S was added to the beads in an in vitro binding assay. The full-length inactive cytoplasmic domain, 6His-C817S, bound to the phosphotyrosine beads, but 6His-D2 did not (Fig. 4). In a total of eight experiments, with varying concentrations of proteins, phosphotyrosine beads, and buffer components, 6His-C817S consistently bound to phosphotyrosine, whereas 6His-D2 did not. Upon longer exposure of the film, 6His-D2 was sometimes detectable in the phosphotyrosine bead sample relative to the Sepharose bead control, but this was insignificant relative to the binding of 6His-C817S. Therefore, unlike the catalytic PTP domain of CD45, CD45-D2 does not bind significantly to phosphotyrosine. CD45-D2 Binding to the Lck Kinase Domain Is Not Hindered by the Non-catalytic Regions or Conformational State of Lck— To determine if the non-catalytic regions of Lck affected the binding of CD45-D2 to the Lck kinase domain, binding of 6His-D2 to the isolated kinase domain was compared with binding to full-length Lck (Fig. 5A).

Integration proceeds in two consecutive integrase-mediated reactions: 3′-processing and strand transfer. To investigate the DNA minor groove interactions of integrase relative to known sites of integrase action, we synthesized oligodeoxynucleotides containing single covalent adducts of known absolute configuration derived from trans-opening of benzo-[a]pyrene 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide by the exocyclic 2-amino group of deoxyguanosine at specific positions in a duplex sequence corresponding to the terminus of the viral U5 DNA. Because the orientations of the hydrocarbon in the minor groove are known from NMR solution structures of duplex oligonucleotides containing these deoxyguanosine adducts, a detailed analysis of the relationship between the position of minor groove ligands and integrase interactions is possible. Adducts placed in the DNA minor groove two or three nucleotides from the 3′-processing site inhibited both 3′-processing and strand transfer. Inosine substitution showed that the guanine 2-amino group is required for efficient 3′-processing at one of these positions and for efficient strand transfer at the other. Mapping of the integration sites on both strands of the DNA substrates indicated that the adducts both inhibit strand transfer specifically at the minor groove bound sites and enhance integration at sites up to six nucleotides away from the adducts. These experiments demonstrate the importance of positionspecific minor groove contacts for both the integrase-mediated 3′-processing and strand transfer reactions.

Integrase catalyzes insertion of cDNA copies of the viral genome into human chromosomes. During this reaction, integrase multimers are associated with both ends of the viral cDNA and several host and viral proteins that together form preintegration complexes. The biochemical reactions catalyzed by integrase can be studied in vitro with recombinant integrase and synthetic oligonucleotides. In vivo, integrase first catalyzes a cleavage reaction releasing a dinucleotide (5′-p-GT-3′) from the 3′-end of each viral long terminal repeat (LTR) (3′-processing, 3′-P; Figs. 1A, 2A, and 2B). The exposed 3′-hydroxyl at the cleavage site is then used by integrase for nucleophilic attack upon a target DNA, resulting in insertion of the viral genome into a target chromosome (strand transfer, ST) (Fig. 2A). Cellular factors perform gap repair and ligation between the viral and host genome junctions. In vitro, a single DNA duplex consisting of the last 21 nucleotides of the HIV-1 U5 LTR (Fig. 1A) can be used to study both 3′-P and ST (Fig. 2A). The cleavage reaction (3′-P) is observed as accumulation of a 19-mer DNA band on a denaturing sequencing gel. Another identical duplex serves as the target DNA, and the ST reaction products (STPs) are observed as bands migrating higher than the substrate 21-mer in a denaturing sequencing gel (see Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Inhibition of both 3′-P and ST by BaP DE adducts at the L4 position near the 3′-P site.Asterisks indicate the position of the radioactive label.

Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10Mazumder A. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2865-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The deoxyadenosine within the conserved CA has been shown to form a cross-link to Lys-159 of integrase (11Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This Lys-159 residue also contacts the phosphate 5′ to the conserved deoxyadenosine in a two-domain structure of integrase (3Wang J.Y. Ling H. Yang W. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis showed that Tyr-143 and probably Gln-148 interact with the 5′-overhang (lower strand; Fig. 2A) resulting from upper strand 3′-P (11Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 12Ellison V. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7316-7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Disulfide cross-linking revealed proximity of the integrase amino acid 246 when mutated from glutamic acid to cysteine and the seventh base from the 5′-end of the lower strand of the U5 LTR (1Gao K. Butler S.L. Bushman F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although these four contacts have been useful for general alignment of the viral DNA substrate relative to integrase, additional information is required for any higher resolution modeling or facilitation of structure-based drug design. Ethylation interference has been used to locate phosphates that are critical for integrase catalysis (13Bushman F.D. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3458-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This method highlighted specific DNA backbone contacts required for ST near the insertion site. On the donor strand, the phosphate 5′ to the nucleophilic deoxyadenosine 3′-hydroxyl group, as well as the two phosphates on the complementary strand that are closest to the cleavage site, were important for ST. Within the target DNA, the two phosphates proximal to the ST site were important. Together, these observations suggest many stabilizing contacts between integrase, the tip of the cleaved LTR, and the site of ST. We have used covalent adducts (Fig. 1B) derived from trans-opening of enantiomeric benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxides (BaP DE, isomer in which the epoxide oxygen and the benzylic 7-hydroxyl group are trans) by the exocyclic amino group of deoxyguanosine (dG) as probes of the interactions between DNA-processing enzymes, such as human and vaccinia topoisomerases (14Pommier Y.

These adducts in DNA exhibit well-defined structural motifs as shown by two-dimensional NMR studies in solution (17Cosman M. de los Santos C. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E. Singh S.B. Ibanez V. Margulis L.A.

The trans-opened BaP DE-dG adducts do not significantly disturb Watson-Crick base pairing or B-form DNA helix conformation (17Cosman M. de los Santos C. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E. Singh S.B. Ibanez V.

Patel D.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 111-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Thus such adducts, when inserted site specifically into oligonucleotides, provide valuable tools to map interactions between enzymes and their DNA substrates. In the present study, we have applied this approach to examine the effect of minor groove modifications at defined positions relative to the known sites of integrase action. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing single trans-(R) or trans-(S) BaP DE dG adducts at specific positions in the 21-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to the end of the viral U5 LTR were used (Fig. 1A). For two of these positions close to the 3′-P site, the importance of minor groove contacts was also tested by replacing the normal deoxyguanosine with deoxyinosine. This modification does not disturb the B-form DNA helix conformation but does remove the H-bonding potential of the 2-amino group of guanosine. Our study demonstrates that minor groove scanning with BaP DE dG adducts and deoxyinosine substitution can reveal specific molecular interactions between integrase and the DNA minor groove. The effects of minor groove interference on 3′-P and ST are separable based on positioning of the minor groove modification. Adducts placed near the 3′-P cleavage site selectively inhibit both 3′-P and ST, whereas adducts placed distal to the 3′-P site selectively inhibit ST and thus uncouple the two integrase reactions. Oligonucleotide Synthesis—Unmodified and inosine-substituted oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA). Oligonucleotides containing the trans-opened BaP DE dG adducts were synthesized as described previously (20Kroth H. Yagi H. Sayer J.M. Kumar S. Jerina D.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 708-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using a manual coupling step for the adducted phosphoramidites. Oligonucleotides U17(R,S) and L4(R,S) (for notation, see Fig. 1A) were prepared from the mixed 10R/10S diastereomers of the BaP DE dG phosphoramidite (20Kroth H. Yagi H. Sayer J.M. Kumar S. Jerina D.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 708-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Their absolute configurations were assigned from the long-wavelength CD spectra of the separated oligonucleotides, which exhibit positive bands in the 330–360 nm region for the 10R adduct and negative bands for the 10S adduct (21Page J.E. Zajc B. Oh-Hara T. Lakshman M.K. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Dipple A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9127-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All other adducted oligonucleotides were prepared from diastereomerically pure 10R or 10S phosphoramidites derived from the 10R and 10S diastereomers of the BaP DE dG adducts that had been separated as their O6-allyl di-tert-butyldimethylsilyl triacetates (22Kroth H. Yagi H. Seidel A. Jerina D.M. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 5558-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Characterization of the diastereomerically pure phosphoramidites is given in the Supplemental Information. All adducted oligonucleotides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (see Supplemental Information for conditions and retention times). Oligonucleotides were further purified on denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) or 3′-labeled by terminal transferase (NEB, Beverly, MA) with cordycepin [α-32P]dATP (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by mini Quickspin oligo column (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The duplex DNA was annealed by addition of an equal concentration of the complementary strand, heating to 95°C, and slow cooling to room temperature. Integrase Reactions—Recombinant wild-type HIV-1 integrase was purified from Escherichia coli as described (23Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with the addition of 10% glycerol to all buffers. Integrase was incubated with DNA substrates for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction conditions were 600 nm integrase, 20 nm duplex DNA, 7.5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.2. This high concentration of integrase was used to maintain the multimer complex required for enzymatic activity. Results similar to those reported here with manganese were also observed with magnesium in the reaction mixture. Reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of gel loading dye (formamide containing 1% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol). Products were separated on 20% polyacrylamide denaturing sequencing gels. Dried gels were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics 445 SI phosphorimager (Sunnyvale, CA). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageQuant software from Molecular Dynamics. The Schiff base cross-linking experiments were performed as described (24Mazumder A. Neamati N. Pilon A.A. Sunder S. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27330-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides containing a uracil at position U19 (annealed to unmodified or adducted lower strands) or L7 (annealed to unmodified or adducted upper strands) were 5′-32P-labeled as described above. After annealing, uracil DNA glycolylase was added to create an abasic site at the uracil position. The abasic site facilitates ribose opening and formation of a Schiff base cross-link between an aldehyde group on the ribose and a nearby integrase lysine. The crosslinks were stabilized by addition of 100 mm sodium borohydride. The cross-linked integrase-DNA products were separated from the substrate DNA by SDS-PAGE using 16% tricine gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). We placed a single trans-opened BaP DE dG adduct at each of five positions within the terminal 21 bases of the HIV-1 U5 LTR outlined in Fig. 1A. The locations chosen for the BaP DE dG adducts are near the site of 3′-P and the prominent ST sites (see mapping of ST sites in Fig. 5). By convention, modified (dG adducted) oligonucleotides were named (U) and (L) when the adduct was attached on the upper or lower strand, respectively. The position of the adduct was counted from the 5′-end of the strand bearing the adduct. For instance, U17(S) refers to the modified duplex oligonucleotide with a BaP DE trans-(S) dG adduct at the 17th position relative to the 5′-end of the upper strand (see Fig. 1). Binding of Integrase to Modified Oligonucleotides Containing BaP DE dG Adducts—Before investigating integrase catalytic reactions, we examined the binding of integrase to the adducted oligonucleotides using the Schiff base cross-link assay between integrase and its DNA substrate (24Mazumder A. Neamati N. Pilon A.A. Sunder S. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27330-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). None of the BaP DE dG adducts affected integrase binding to the modified DNAs (Fig. 1S, Supplemental Information). Effect of Minor Groove BaP DE Adducts Close to the 3′-P Site—Two of the sites chosen to incorporate BaP DE dG adducts are located near the integrase 3′-P site: L4 and U17 (see Fig. 1A). The effects of trans-(R) and trans-(S) BaP DE adducts at the L4 position were evaluated on both the 3′-P and the ST reactions (Fig. 2). Integrase reactions are shown schematically in A, B, E, and F. The trans-(R) adduct (L4(R)) partially inhibited the formation of the 3′-P product of the normal length (19-mer) (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 3 and 2). Additionally, the L4(R) adduct caused an enhanced additional cleavage because of abnormal 3′-P (gray arrowhead in B), leading to accumulation of 20-mer DNA. The trans-(S) adduct (L4(S)) blocked 3′-P to a greater degree than the trans-(R) adduct (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 4 and 3). Enhanced accumulation of the 20-mer DNA was not observed for the L4(S) adduct. 3′-P products were quantified to compare the cleavage efficiency between the control and adducted DNAs (Fig. 2D). For the L4(R) adduct, 3′-P at the normal site (generating the 19-mer product) was ∼35% of 3′-P for the unmodified oligonucleotide. The abnormal 3′-P (generating the 20-mer product) was greater than the normal 3′-P for the L4(R) adduct. However, if the 19- and 20-mer products are summed, total normal and abnormal 3′-P was similar for the L4(R) adduct and for control DNA (35% versus 38%, respectively). Because inhibition of 3′-P precludes the formation of STP, a precleaved substrate was used to examine the ST reaction independently of 3′-P (see scheme in Fig. 2E) in the presence of the L4(R) and L4(S) adducts. Both the trans-(R) and trans-(S) substrates (Fig. 2F) blocked the integrase ST reaction (Fig. 2G), indicating that the L4(R) and L4(S) adducts inhibit both steps of the integrase reactions. Placement of BaP DE dG adducts at the U17 position allowed examination of the importance of the minor groove when the adducts are attached to the upper strand of the DNA near the integrase 3′-P site (Fig. 3A). Each upper strand DNA (control and adducted) was 5′-labeled individually. The adducted oligonucleotides migrate slower than the unadducted oligonucleotide because of the added mass of the BaP DE adduct. The migration of the control and adducted DNAs are noted by 21 and 21†, respectively (Fig. 3B). Both the trans-(R) and trans-(S) BaP DE dG adducts blocked 3′-P (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6) and therefore ST. Small levels of 3′-P (including an abnormal band corresponding to the 20-mer adducted product) and ST were, however, visible for the U17(S) adduct. The effects of the U17(S) adduct on the ST reactions were examined directly using a precleaved substrate (see Fig. 2E) containing the trans-(S) BaP DE dG adduct at the U17 position to isolate the ST reaction. Using this adducted DNA (Fig. 3C), ST was not observed (Fig. 3D, lane 4). Together, the data obtained with the L4 and U17 BaP DE adducted DNAs demonstrate that the presence of a BaP DE dG minor groove adduct two or three nucleotides 5′ from the 3′-P site and spanning the minor groove adjacent to the 3′-P site interferes with both 3′-P and ST. Role of the Guanine 2-Amino Group at the U17 and L4 Positions—Because the U17 and L4 BaP DE dG adducts were linked to the guanine 2-amino position in the minor groove, oligonucleotides containing inosine substitutions at the L4 (Fig. 4, A and C) and U17 (Fig. 4E) positions were examined to determine the role of the guanine 2-amino group on 3′-P and ST. The L4 inosine caused a marked decrease in 3′-P (81%) and ST (92%) (Fig. 4B, lane 3). ST was directly tested using a precleaved upper strand (Fig. 4C). The L4 inosine did not block ST (Fig. 4D, lane 3), indicating that it selectively inhibited 3′-P. In the presence of the U17 inosine (Fig. 4E), 3′-P was similar to the control DNA, and ST was only partially reduced (by ∼24%, Fig. 4F, lane 4). These results demonstrate the critical importance of the minor groove guanine 2-amino group at position L4 for 3′-P and its dispensability at an adjacent position in the upper strand (U17). Mapping of the Integrase ST Sites in the U5 LTR Sequence—To examine the effects of BaP DE dG adducts at positions L8, L10, and U6 (see Fig. 1A) on ST reactions, we first had to map the ST sites within the U5 LTR. With the unmodified U5 LTR oligonucleotide labeled at the 5′-end of the upper strand, clusters of ST sites are consistently observed (see Figs. 2 and 3). However, the STP bands cannot be assigned unambiguously because they arise from both upper and lower strand STP (see Fig. 2A). To map the integration sites and therefore the effects of BaP DE adducts, we used 3′-end-labeling with cordycepin either on the upper (Fig. 5A) or the lower (Fig. 5B) strand. For consistency in referring to the 3′- and 5′-end-labeled products, we did not include the cordycepin in numbering the residues in the 3′-end-labeled oligonucleotides. Placing the radioactive label at the 3′-end of one of the strands of the DNA allows the mapping of strand-specific integration products. For example, only the STP on the left side of the diagram in Fig. 5A will be observed when 3′-labeled upper strand DNA is used (Fig. 5C). These STPs result from ST into the upper strand. The STP on the right side of Fig. 5A, resulting from ST into the lower strand, do not contain a radioactive label and therefore cannot be observed. Likewise, only the STPs illustrated on the right of Fig. 5B are detectable in the gel shown in Fig. 5D. Various DNA size markers (M) matching several integration products were included so that the sizes of the STPs could be determined (Fig. 5, C and D). The upper 24, lower 24, and lower 25 markers match the sequence of the integration products and therefore have the same electrophoretic migration as the 24 and 25 STPs. The upper 30, upper 34, lower 30, and lower 32 markers differ in sequence from the predicted STPs and migrate slightly faster (by approximately half a base) than the corresponding STPs. A map of preferred integration sites on unmodified DNA was created by analyzing the strand-specific pattern of integration bands (Fig. 5E). The intensity of a band on a sequencing gel corresponds to the frequency of integration events at a particular site. Densitometric analysis was used to create a graph illustrating band migration for each STP (Fig. 5E). The height of each peak was transferred into a bar-graph format and aligned with the substrate DNA sequence (Fig. 5E) to illustrate the locations of ST. On the upper strand, two clusters of STP peaks were observed: one around the U6 position generating STPs migrating between 31- and 35-mers, and the other near the 3′-P site generating STPs migrating between 22- and 24-mers. Several STPs migrating between the 22- and 24-mer STPs are indicated as a striped bar because these bands did not migrate at expected positions; therefore, the exact position of ST is an approximation. On the lower strand, two STP clusters were observed peaking around 24- and 32-mers, respectively. The 32-mer STP peak was adjacent to the L8 and L10 positions, where BaP DE dG adducts were located in the experiments to be described below. Strand-specific mapping was used for analyzing the effects of each adduct. Effect of the L8, L10, and U6 BaP DE dG Adducts on ST— The L8 and L10 positions are near the prominent lower strand STP peak 32 (identified in Fig. 5). The data in Fig. 6, B and C, show the results of labeling of the 5′-end of the upper strand of the L8(R) and L8(S) adducted duplexes and provide a composite of the STP in the upper and lower strands. In contrast, 3′-end labeling of the upper strand (shown in Fig. 6, D and E) allows detection of upper strand STP only and may be compared with Fig. 5, C and E (U3′). None of the upper strand STPs from the L(8) adducted oligonucleotides contain adducts, and thus they migrate at the same positions as the unmodified controls. In the unadducted control (Fig. 6B, lane 2), the triplet of STPs with the most prominent peak at 32 (indicated by the double-headed arrow) is attributable to integration into the lower strand. Decreased intensity was observed for this 32 STP cluster with the L8(R) adduct, and to a lesser extent with the L8(S) adduct, when compared with the control. Suppression of STPs at this site is presumably attributable to proximity of the adducts. Changes to the ST pattern resulting from integration into the intact upper strand induced by the BaP DE adducts at the L8 position are shown in Fig. 6, D and E. The L8(S) adduct slightly enhanced the upper strand 33, whereas the L8(R) adduct suppressed the 24 STPs and resulted in two new STPs at 23 and 25. The strong 23 STPs (Fig. 6D, lane 3) are not apparent in the composite products seen on 5′-end-labeling of the upper strand (Fig. 6B, lane 3) and may result from an integration that occurs only when the upper strand is extended by one base by the cordycepin label. The L8(S) adduct gave an anomalous, unidentified upper-strand integration product that migrated between the bands corresponding to 25 and 24 STPs. We next investigated the effects of the BaP DE adducts at the L10 position (Fig. 7A), two nu"
