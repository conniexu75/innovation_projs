https://openalex.org/W2023486727,The cortex of the inferior parietal lobule in primates is important for spatial perception and spatially oriented behavior. Recordings of single neurons in this area in behaving monkeys showed that the visual sensitivity of the retinotopic receptive fields changes systematically with the angle of gaze. The activity of many of the neurons can be largely described by the product of a gain factor that is a function of the eye position and the response profile of the visual receptive field. This operation produces an eye position-dependent tuning for locations in head-centered coordinate space.
https://openalex.org/W2042458290,"Protein localization in cells is initiated by the binding of characteristic leader (signal) peptides to specific receptors on the membranes of mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum or, in bacteria, to the plasma membrane. There are differences in the timing of protein synthesis and translocation into or across the bilayer and in the requirement for a transmembrane electrochemical potential. Comparisons of protein localization in these different membranes suggest underlying common mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2104646138,"Crystals of the adduct of the anticancer drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), cis-DDP, with d(pGpG), its putative target on DNA in the cancer cell, have been obtained and used in an x-ray crystallographic study to elucidate the molecular structure to atomic resolution. Each of the four crystallographically independent cis-[Pt(NH3)2(d(pGpG))] molecules is comprised of a square-planar platinum atom bonded to two ammonia ligands and two N(7) atoms of guanosine nucleosides from the same chain. Base stacking of the two adjacent guanine rings is completely disrupted by coordination to the cis-(Pt(NH3)2)2+ unit. Comparison of the backbone and deoxyribose ring torsion angles with those found by previous (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) studies of this adduct in solution demonstrates that the solid state geometry is substantially the same as that in solution. The relevance of these results to the molecular mechanism of action of cis-DDP is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2046073691,"The generation of specific patterns of neuronal connections has usually been regarded as a central problem in neurobiology. The prevailing view for many years has been that these connections are established by complementary recognition molecules on the pre- and postsynaptic cells (the chemoaffinity theory). Experimental results obtained in the past decade, however, indicate that the view that axon guidance and synaptogenesis proceed according to restrictive chemical markers is too narrow. Although a more rigid plan may prevail in some invertebrates, the formation of specific connections in vertebrates also involves competition between axon terminals, trophic feedback between pre- and postsynaptic cells, and modification of connections by functional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1585658616,"Studies were conducted to ascertain if transthyretin mRNA was present in extrahepatic tissues of the rat. A trnasthyretin cDNA clone was isolated from a lambda gt11 human liver cDNA library by antibody screening and its identity was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. This transthyretin cDNA clone was used to survey poly(A+) RNA isolated from 12 different rat tissues for transthyretin mRNA by Northern blot analysis. The liver contained the highest level of transthyretin mRNA and this level was not altered by the vitamin A status of the rat. A significant amount of transthyretin mRNA was found in the brain (30% of the level of the liver) which was localized in specific regions of the brain. In addition, detectable levels of transthyretin mRNA (1% to 2% of that of the liver) were observed in the stomach, heart, skeletal muscle, and spleen. Translation of brain poly(A+) RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and immunoprecipitation of the translation products with anti-transthyretin antiserum resulted in a protein band of the same size as liver pre-transthyretin. Liver pre-transthyretin was processed by the cotranslational addition of dog pancreas microsomal membranes to a protein that migrated coincidentally with monomeric serum transthyretin. These data suggest that transthyretin in the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid results from de novo synthesis and that transthyretin may play a significant physiological function, as yet unknown, within the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1484853482,"Platelets have previously been shown to contain a membrane skeleton that is composed of actin filaments, actin-binding protein, and three membrane glycoproteins (GP), GP Ib, GP Ia, and a minor glycoprotein of Mr = 250,000. The present study was designed to determine how the membrane glycoproteins were linked to actin filaments. Unstimulated platelets were lysed with Triton X-100, and the membrane skeleton was isolated on sucrose density gradients or by high-speed centrifugation. The association of the membrane glycoproteins with the actin filaments was disrupted when actin-binding protein was hydrolyzed by activity of the Ca2+-dependent protease, which was active in platelet lysates upon addition of Ca2+ in the absence of leupeptin. Similarly, activation of the Ca2+-dependent protease in intact platelets by the addition of a platelet agonist also caused the membrane glycoproteins to dissociate from the membrane skeleton. Affinity-purified actin-binding protein antibodies immunoprecipitated the membrane glycoproteins from platelet lysates in which actin filaments had been removed by DNase I-induced depolymerization and high-speed centrifugation. These results demonstrate that actin-binding protein links actin filaments of the platelet membrane skeleton to three plasma membrane glycoproteins and that filaments are released from their attachment site when actin-binding protein is hydrolyzed by the Ca2+-dependent protease within intact platelets during platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W2037022310,"A significant increase in the production of cysteinyl leukotrienes was observed after mechanical or thermal trauma in the anesthesized rat. The amount of biliary N-acetyl-leukotriene E4, which represents a suitable indicator for blood plasma leukotrienes, was used as a measure of leukotriene generation. Cysteinyl leukotrienes were rapidly eliminated from blood plasma into bile where N-acetyl-leukotriene E4 was the major metabolite. Leukotrienes were at a much lower concentration in blood plasma than in bile and differed in the pattern of metabolites. The detected amounts of leukotrienes were sufficient to induce known phenomena associated with trauma, such as tissue edema and circulatory and respiratory dysfunction. Increased leukotriene generation appears to play an important role in the pathophysiology of tissue trauma."

https://openalex.org/W2072424877,"Clinical studies have suggested that excess dietary iodine promotes autoimmune thyroiditis; however, the lack of a suitable animal model has hampered investigation of the phenomenon. In this study, different amounts of potassium iodide were added to the diets of chicken strains known to be genetically susceptible to autoimmune thyroiditis. Administration of iodine during the first 10 weeks of life increased the incidence of the disease, as determined by histology and the measurement of autoantibodies to triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and thyroglobulin. Further support for the relation between iodine and autoimmune thyroiditis was provided by an experiment in which iodine-deficient regimens decreased the incidence of thyroid autoantibodies in a highly susceptible strain. These results suggest that excessive consumption of iodine in the United States may be responsible for the increased incidence of autoimmune thyroiditis."

https://openalex.org/W1535254030,"Thirteen forms of glutathione S-transferase were isolated from human liver in high yields by glutathione-affinity chromatography and chromatofocusing. Apparent isoelectric points ranged from 4.9 to 8.9 and included neutral forms. All 13 forms appeared to be identical immunochemically in a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These forms were immunochemically distinct from the major acidic glutathione S-transferase found in placenta and erythrocyte and were immunochemically distinct from two forms of higher molecular weight glutathione S-transferase found in some but not all liver samples. The 13 forms exhibited similar activities with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitro-benzene as substrate, specific activities of 33-94 mumol/min/mg. Likewise, these forms all exhibited glutathione peroxidase activity with cumene hydroperoxide, specific activities of 1.5-8.3 mumol/min/mg. All 13 forms bound bilirubin with subsequent conformational changes leading to states devoid of transferase activity, a process prevented by the presence of foreign proteins. As hematin-binding proteins, however, these multiple transferases exhibited a very broad range of binding extending from nonbinding to high-affinity binding (KD approximately 10(-8) M). Hematin binding was noncompetitive with transferase activity and did not involve the bilirubin-binding site, suggesting the existence of unique heme-binding sites on these proteins. The two forms of the immunochemically distinct glutathione S-transferases transferases found in some liver samples also exhibited both transferase and peroxidase activities. In addition, they also have separate sites for binding bilirubin and hematin."
https://openalex.org/W1487869417,"Seven different monoclonal antibodies of the IgG class that are reactive with four different antigens on human lymphoid cells were utilized to form immunotoxins with the ribosome-inactivating proteins gelonin and the three known pokeweed antiviral proteins. Thirteen different immunotoxin combinations were prepared. The ribosome-inactivating proteins were modified with 2-iminothiolane. The sulfhydryl groups so introduced were reacted with maleimido groups or with dithiopyridyl groups that had been introduced into the antibodies. The toxin-antibody conjugates so formed were purified by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, ion exchange chromatography, and by gel filtration and were characterized by polyacrylamide-dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The purified immunotoxins were free of nonconjugated monomeric proteins and aggregates of very high molecular weight. All the immunotoxins showed the specific binding of the component antibody as measured by indirect immunofluorescence binding assays. The activities of the ribosome-inactivating proteins were unaffected by conjugation where the cross-link to the antibody contained a disulfide bond and when assayed after reductive cleavage of the linker. Disulfide-linked immunotoxins with six of the antibodies were highly cytotoxic for the target cells. However, immunotoxins containing an anti-B1 antibody showed no cytotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W1508115172,"The influence of extracellular Ca2+ on hormone-mediated increases of cytosolic free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) and phosphorylase activity was studied in isolated hepatocytes. In the presence of 1.3 mM extracellular Ca2+, the stimulation of phosphorylase activity produced by vasopressin or phenylephrine was maintained for 20-30 min. In contrast, the change in [Ca2+]i under these conditions was more transient and declined within 3-4 min to steady state values only 70 +/- 8 nM above the resting [Ca2+]i. Removal of the hormone from its receptor with specific antagonists caused a decline in [Ca2+]i back to the original resting values. Subsequent addition of a second hormone elicited a further Ca2+ transient. If the antagonist was omitted, the second hormone addition did not increase [Ca2+]i indicating that the labile intracellular Ca2+ pool remains depleted during receptor occupation. When extracellular Ca2+ was omitted, both the changes of [Ca2+]i and phosphorylase a caused by vasopressin were transient and returned exactly to resting values within 3-4 min. The subsequent readdition of Ca2+ to these cells produced a further increase of [Ca2+]i and phosphorylase activity which was larger than the changes observed upon Ca2+ addition to untreated cells. This reactivation of phosphorylase showed saturation kinetics with respect to extracellular [Ca2+], was maximally stimulated within 1 min of vasopressin addition and was inhibited by high concentration of diltiazem. We conclude that entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell is required in order to obtain a sustained hormonal stimulation of phosphorylase activity and is responsible for the maintenance of a small steady state elevation of [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W2411726465,"Plasma-derived lipid transfer protein (LTP) facilitates the transfer of cholesteryl ester and triglyceride between all lipoproteins. Kinetic models of the transfer event have suggested that transfer is facilitated through the physical interaction (binding) of LTP with its lipoprotein substrate. Such binding has been observed previously between LTP and high density lipoprotein (HDL), but not between LTP and low (LDL) or very low (VLDL) density lipoproteins. In the present study, the interaction of LTP with plasma lipoproteins has been re-evaluated. These experiments have employed Sepharose-bound lipoproteins in order to facilitate the rapid separation of unbound and lipoprotein-associated LTP. The validity of this approach in assessing LTP-lipoprotein interactions was evidenced by the fact that free (unbound) lipoproteins could competitively inhibit or disrupt the binding of LTP to the Sepharose-bound lipoproteins. LTP was observed to bind to VLDL, LDL, and HDL. Whereas VLDL- and LDL-LTP complexes were labile and almost completely dissociated in 90 min, HDL-LTP complexes remained intact during this time. Under equilibrium conditions, LTP binding to all lipoproteins was characterized by high affinity, saturable kinetics; the apparent affinities (Kd) of VLDL, LDL, and HDL for LTP were nearly the same (congruent to 25 nM). The results of two studies correlated lipid transfer activity with LTP binding to lipoproteins: 1) LTP binding and transfer activity increased in parallel as the amount of LTP in the assay was increased and 2) the inhibition of transfer activity caused by differing amounts of an inhibitory protein correlated with similar decrements in LTP binding. The latter data also suggest that the inhibitor protein suppresses lipid transfer activity by disrupting LTP-lipoprotein interactions. It is concluded that LTP avidly binds to VLDL, LDL, and HDL via a reversible, saturable mechanism and that the binding of LTP to the lipoprotein surface is an integral component of the lipid transfer reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1551768767,"Photosynthetic electron flow, polypeptide pattern, presence of chlorophyll-protein complexes, and phosphorylation of thylakoid polypeptides have been investigated in differentiated mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath (B) thylakoids of the C4 plant Zea mays. The polypeptide pattern of M thylakoids and their photosynthetic electron flow are comparable to those of other green plants. B thylakoids exhibit only photosystem I (PSI) activity, contain only traces of the PSII light harvesting (LHCII) polypeptide, do not bind [3H] diuron, and lack polypeptides of the water-oxidation complex of PSII and the herbicide binding 32-kDa polypeptide, as detected by specific antibodies. However, B thylakoids possess a partially active PSII reaction center, as demonstrated by light-dependent reduction of silicomolybdate with 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC) as an electron donor, and the presence of the PSII reaction center polypeptides of 44-47 kDa. Only one chlorophyll a-protein complex, corresponding to the PSI reaction center-core antenna, was detectable in B thylakoids, as opposed to chlorophyll a and chlorophyll a,b-protein complexes present in M thylakoids. The light-dependent, membrane-bound kinase activity present in M thylakoids could not be detected in B thylakoids which, nevertheless, contain a protein kinase able to phosphorylate casein. A total of 19 differences between the electrophoretic pattern of B and M thylakoid polypeptides were observed. The mRNA coding for the LHCII polypeptide is primarily, if not exclusively, localized in M cells. The development of PSII complex precedes that of PSI during the differentiation of B and M chloroplasts in expanding leaves of light-grown plants and during the greening of dark-grown etiolated seedlings. The differentiation of the maize leaf into cells programmed to form B or M chloroplasts does not require light. In light-grown plants, the differentiation of B and M thylakoids occurred progressively from the base of the leaf and was completed at 4-5 cm from the leaf base."
https://openalex.org/W25676136,"Prokaryotic derived probes that specifically recognize alpha-2,8-ketosidically linked polysialosyl units were developed to identify and study the temporal expression of these unique carbohydrate moieties in developing neural tissue (Vimr, E. R., McCoy, R. D., Vollger, H. F., Wilkison, N. C., and Troy, F. A. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 1971-1975). These polysialosyl units cap N-linked oligosaccharides of the complex-type on neural cell adhesion molecules (N-CAM). A Golgi-enriched fraction from 20-day-old fetal rat brain contains a membrane-associated sialyltransferase that catalyzes the incorporation of [14C]N-acetylneuraminic acid [( 14C]NeuNAc) from CMP-[14C] NeuNAc into polymeric products. At pH 6.0, 84 pmol of NeuNAc mg of protein-1 h-1 were incorporated. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, the major radiolabeled species migrated with a mobility expected for N-CAM. A bacteriophage-derived endoneuraminidase specific for polysialic acid was used to demonstrate that at least 20-30% of the [14C]NeuNAc was incorporated into alpha-2,8-linked polysialosyl units. This was confirmed by structural studies which showed that the endoneuraminidase-sensitive brain material consisted of multimers of sialic acid. The addition of a partially purified preparation of chick N-CAM to the membranous sialyltransferase stimulated sialic acid incorporation 3-fold. The product of this reaction was also sensitive to endoneuraminidase and contained alpha-2,8-linked polysialosyl chains, thus showing that N-CAM can serve as an exogenous acceptor for sialylation in vitro. Sialic acid incorporated into adult rat brain membranes was resistant to endoneuraminidase, indicating that the poly-alpha-2,8-sialosyl sialyltransferase activity is restricted to an early developmental epoch. It is recommended that the enzyme described here be designated CMP-NeuNAc:poly-alpha-2,8-sialosyl sialyltransferase and the trivial name poly-alpha-2,8-sialosyl sialyltransferase be adopted."

https://openalex.org/W2064328220,"Current treatments for severe jaundice can result in major complications. Neonatal jaundice is caused by excessive accumulation of bilirubin in the blood. A small blood filter containing immobilized bilirubin oxidase was developed to reduce serum bilirubin concentrations. When human or rat blood was passed through the enzyme filter, more than 90 percent of the bilirubin was degraded in a single pass. This procedure may have important applications in the clinical treatment of neonatal jaundice."
https://openalex.org/W1482211895,"Horseradish peroxidase catalyzed the H2O2-dependent oxidation and polymerization of acetaminophen. Six acetaminophen polymers were isolated from horseradish peroxidase reaction mixtures by semipreparative high pressure liquid chromatography. Chemical structures were determined by a combination of electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectrometry and 500-MHz proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Two dimers, three trimers, and one tetramer were identified. The polymers formed primarily through a covalent bond between carbons ortho to the hydroxyl group, and to a lesser extent, between the carbon ortho to the hydroxyl group and the amino group of another acetaminophen molecule. Greater than 99% of the polymerization reaction products were quenched by the addition of 2.0 mM ascorbate. High acetaminophen concentration favored dimer formation, whereas low acetaminophen concentration favored formation of trimers and tetramers. Since approximately 1 mol of H2O2 was consumed per mol of covalent ligand formed between acetaminophen molecules, these products probably result from free radical termination reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1486976896,"The sodium- and chloride-coupled gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter from rat brain has been highly purified. Synaptic plasma membranes from rat brain were extracted with cholate in the presence of 10% ammonium sulfate. The soluble extract was incorporated into liposomes consisting of asolectin and crude brain lipids. Brain lipids markedly enhanced the transport activity. The resulting proteoliposomes catalyzed sodium- and chloride-coupled gamma-aminobutyric acid transport which, in the presence of internal potassium, was greatly (up to 20-fold) stimulated by valinomycin. Using this transport of the reconstituted system as an assay, the transporter was purified by the following steps. The cholate extract was fractionated by ammonium sulfate. The activity was not precipitated by 50% but could be precipitated by 70% ammonium sulfate. The cholate and ammonium sulfate were removed on a Sephadex G-50 column. Subsequently, the transporter was partially purified on DEAE-cellulose in a mixture of Triton X-100 and octyl glucoside. The active fractions were chromatographed on a hydroxylapatite column in the presence of Triton X-100. Although the increase in specific activity was only up to 100-fold, this was due to partial inactivation. The actual purification was at least 1000-fold. The purified transporter exhibited the same features of the synaptic plasma membrane vesicles, namely dependence on sodium and chloride, electrogenicity, and a similar affinity. The sodium dodecyl sulfate gel pattern indicated that a major protein ran as a 24-kDa band. This band may represent the gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1561453626,"A family of enzymatic activities isolated from human mitochondria is capable of initiating DNA replication on single-stranded templates. The principal enzymes include at least a primase and DNA polymerase gamma and require that rNTPs as well as dNTPs be present in the reaction mixture. Poly(dC) and poly(dT), as well as M13 phage DNA, are excellent templates for the primase activity. A single-stranded DNA containing the cloned origin of mitochondrial light-strand synthesis can be a more efficient template than M13 phage DNA alone. Primase and DNA polymerase activities were separated from each other by sedimentation in a glycerol density gradient. Using M13 phage DNA as template, these mitochondrial enzymes synthesize RNA primers that are 9 to 12 nucleotides in size and are covalently linked to nascent DNA. The formation of primers appears to be the rate-limiting step in the replication process. Replication of M13 DNA is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide and dideoxynucleoside triphosphates, but insensitive to rifampicin, alpha-amanitin, and aphidicolin."
https://openalex.org/W1504140615,"By using very low concentrations of cells to minimize alterations in substrate concentrations, we demonstrated that the lactate/pyruvate ratio of the incubation medium, which determines the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio, affects gluconeogenic flux in suspensions of isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats. At a fixed extracellular pyruvate concentration of 1 mM and with the lactate/pyruvate ratio varied from 0.6 to 10 and to 50, glucose production rates increased from 2.5 to 5.5 and then decreased to 1.8 nmol/mg of cell protein/min. This finding paralleled the observation of Sugano et al. (Sugano, T., Shiota, M., Tanaka, T., Miyamae, Y., Shimada, M., and Oshino, N. (1980) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 87, 153-166) who noted a similar biphasic response in the perfused liver system when lactate was held constant and pyruvate varied. The biphasic relationship can be explained by the influence of the NADH/NAD+ ratio on the near-equilibrium reactions catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase in the hepatocyte cytosol. By shifting the equilibrium of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction, a rise in the NADH/NAD+ ratio decreases the concentration of 3-phosphoglycerate which, because of the linkage of 3-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate through two near-equilibrium reactions, reduces the concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate and therefore causes a decline in flux through pyruvate kinase. This decrease in pyruvate kinase flux results in an enhanced gluconeogenic flux. At higher NADH/NAD+ ratios, however, the oxalacetate concentration drops to such an extent that the consequent decreased flux through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase exceeds the decline in flux through pyruvate kinase, producing a decrease in gluconeogenic flux. The lactate/pyruvate ratio was found to influence the actions of three hormones thought to stimulate gluconeogenesis by different mechanisms. Except for an inhibition by glucagon seen at the lowest lactate/pyruvate ratio tested, the stimulations by this hormone were relatively insensitive to lactate/pyruvate ratios, while angiotensin II produced greater stimulations of gluconeogenesis as the lactate/pyruvate ratio was increased. Dexamethasone, added in vitro, stimulated gluconeogenesis significantly only at very low and very high lactate/pyruvate ratios."
https://openalex.org/W1493474945,"We have analyzed the subcellular localization of 125I-labeled ribonuclease A and ribonuclease S-protein (residues 21-124) after erythrocyte-mediated microinjection into confluent cultures of IMR-90 human lung fibroblasts. Microinjected cells were fractionated by two consecutive Percoll gradients, and the distribution of radioactive ribonuclease A and S-protein was compared to patterns for known enzyme markers. Ribonuclease A is localized in the cytosol immediately after microinjection, but thereafter a portion of the microinjected enzyme is associated with lysosomes. We obtained similar results for ribonuclease S-protein except extensive association with a nonlysosomal intracellular structure is also evident. The effects of ammonium chloride on proteolysis indicate that ribonuclease A and ribonuclease S-protein are degraded at least in part by lysosomal pathways. Degradation of long-lived cellular proteins is inhibited by 17% in the presence of serum and by 35% in the absence of serum. The effects of ammonium chloride on catabolism of microinjected proteins are more variable. Inhibition in the presence and absence of serum ranged between 43 and 64% for both ribonuclease A and ribonuclease S-protein. To quantitatively assess the role of lysosomal and cytosolic pathways in the degradation of microinjected proteins, we have tagged proteins with the inert trisaccharide, [3H] raffinose. The radioactive degradation products of such proteins are completely retained within lysosomes since the lysosomal membrane is impermeable to [3H] raffinose coupled to lysine or small peptides. These studies show that ribonuclease A and S-protein are degraded almost entirely by lysosomes while bovine serum albumin is degraded principally in the cytosol. A mixture of rat liver cytosolic proteins is degraded approximately 60% in the cytosol and 40% by lysosomes confirming that both lysosomal and nonlysosomal pathways of proteolysis are important in confluent human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1520448120,"Spectrin tetramers and oligomers in normal erythrocytes are cross-linked by actin and protein 4.1 to form a two-dimensional membrane skeletal network. In the present study, we find that hemin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin, progressively (a) alters the conformation of spectrin as revealed by electron microscope studies and by the decreased resistance of spectrin to proteolytic degradation, (b) alters the conformation of protein 4.1 as revealed by the increased mobility of protein 4.1 on nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, (c) weakens spectrin dimer alpha beta-dimer alpha beta, spectrin alpha-spectrin beta, as well as spectrin-protein 4.1 associations as analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and (d) diminishes the structural stability of erythrocyte membrane skeletons (i.e. Triton-insoluble ghost residues) subjected to mechanical shearing. Since hemin may be liberated from oxidized or unstable mutant hemoglobin under pathological conditions, these hemin-induced effects on spectrin, protein 4.1, and membrane skeletal stability may play a role in the membrane lesion of these erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1488173779,"The b-type cytochrome in porcine neutrophils in situ was studied by the low temperature absorption spectroscopy at 77 K. Absolute spectra of the dithionite-reduced cell suspension revealed the existence of a b-type cytochrome with alpha, beta, and Soret absorption maxima at 558, 528, and 426 nm, respectively. The alpha band was unsymmetrical and showed a main peak at 558 nm with a shoulder at around 556 nm. When the cells were anaerobically stimulated either by phorbol myristate acetate or arachidonate followed by reduction by dithionite, the alpha band split clearly into double peaks at 555.5 and 558 nm, suggesting the presence of at least two states or species of the b-type cytochrome(s) in the cell. By monitoring absolute spectra of neutrophils at 77 K, we examined the possibility of CO binding to the b-type cytochrome. The absorption spectra of reduced b-type cytochrome in the presence and absence of CO, however, were not distinguishable under various conditions including equilibration with CO under high pressure or CO treatments in a dark room or at pH 8.5, 7.0, or 5.5. In contrast, the spectra of the reduced cytochrome disappeared immediately after exposure to O2, whether or not the cells had been treated with CO. The results indicate that the cytochrome does not form a CO complex in situ but reacts with O2, either directly or indirectly."
https://openalex.org/W1592303847,"CRM197, CRM176, and CRM228 are products of single or multiple missense mutations in the diphtheria toxin gene. CRM197 differs from wild-type toxin in 1 amino acid residue of the fragment A region, and also CRM176 and CRM228 have amino acid substitution(s) in fragment A. We compared the binding properties of CRM197 to toxin-sensitive Vero cells with those of diphtheria toxin and other CRMs. Nicked CRM197 is about 50 times more effective than intact CRM197 in inhibiting the action of diphtheria toxin on sensitive cells, as shown by inhibition of diphtheria toxin cytotoxicity or inhibition of binding of 125I-diphtheria toxin. The binding of native toxin or other CRMs was not significantly affected by nicking. Moreover, the binding of CRM197 to cells was unaffected by ATP, although ATP clearly inhibits binding of diphtheria toxin, CRM176, and CRM228. Two kinds of hybrid protein were formed using fragment B of CRM197: one with fragment A of diphtheria toxin and one with fragment A of CRM228. ATP inhibited the binding of these hybrid proteins. Furthermore, the affinities of these hybrid proteins for diphtheria toxin-sensitive cells were the same as that of native toxin. Thus, it was concluded that the altered binding properties of CRM197 were due to alteration of fragment A and what the interaction of diphtheria toxin with ATP involves both fragments. The results also suggest that fragment A plays a role in diphtheria toxin-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1554102497,"Abstract The chemical structure of a major phosphoglycolipid from Deinococcus radiodurans has been shown to be 2'-O-(1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)-3'-O-(alpha-galactosyl)-N-D-gl yceroyl alkylamine. By infrared spectroscopy, the lipid was shown to contain both carbonyl ester and amide linkages. Chemical analysis demonstrated a molar ratio of fatty acid, carbohydrate, and phosphorus of 2:1:1. The lipid was shown to contain an sn-3-phosphatidic acid backbone by digestion with phospholipase A2. Phosphodiester bond cleavage of the lipid with hydrofluoric acid liberated a component which contained galactose, glyceric acid, and alkylamines. Using NMR and permethylation/hydrolysis procedures, galactose was shown to be linked alpha-glycosidically to the 3-O-position of glyceric acid."
https://openalex.org/W1548429343,"F9 embryonal carcinoma cells treated with 5 X 10(-8) M retinoic acid and cultured in suspension for 8 days form aggregates consisting of an outer epithelial layer of alpha-fetoprotein-producing visceral endoderm cells. We have previously shown (Grover, A., Oshima, R. G., and Adamson, E. D. (1983) J. Cell Biol. 96, 1690-1696) that the differentiation of F9 cells to visceral endoderm is accompanied by the activation of several genes, and increased laminin synthesis is one of the earliest events. Here we analyze in detail the syntheses and secretion of fibronectin, type IV collagen, and laminin during the 8-day process. Employing immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we show that the levels of all three components change with different patterns. Unstimulated F9 cells synthesize and secrete relatively high levels of fibronectin and low levels of type IV collagen. Fibronectin synthesis and secretion decreases to 10% of its original level whereas type IV collagen synthesis rises approximately 3-fold during the differentiation process. Laminin synthesis also rises at least 2-fold, and the proportions of its subunits change as the syntheses of B1 and A accelerate starting on day 2. However, unlike fibronectin and type IV collagen, laminin is largely accumulated in the aggregates.

Incorporation of 5 or 13 micrograms of Tris-Gal-Chol into HDL (20 micrograms of protein) stimulates the liver association of the HDL apoprotein radioactivity 24- and 55-fold, respectively, at 10 min after intravenous injection into rats. The increased interaction of Tris-Gal-Chol HDL with the liver is blocked by preinjection of asialofetuin or N-acetylgalactosamine but not influenced by N-acetylglucosamine. The parenchymal liver cell uptake of HDL is stimulated 42- or 105-fold, respectively, by incorporation of 5 or 13 micrograms of Tris-Gal-Chol into HDL (20 micrograms of protein), while the association with nonparenchymal cells is stimulated only 1.7- or 5-fold. It can be calculated that 98.0% of the Tris-Gal-Chol HDL is associated with parenchymal cells. In contrast, incorporation of 13 micrograms of Tris-Gal-Chol into LDL (20 micrograms of protein) leads to a selective association of LDL with nonparenchymal cells (92.3% of the total liver uptake). It is concluded that Tris-Gal-Chol incorporation into HDL leads to a specific interaction of HDL with the asialoglycoprotein (galactose) receptor on parenchymal cells whereas Tris-Gal-Chol incorporation into LDL leads mainly to an interaction with a galactose receptor from Kupffer cells. Probably this highly selective cellular targeting of LDL and HDL by Tris-Gal-Chol is caused by the difference in size between these lipoproteins. The increased interaction of HDL with the parenchymal cells upon Tris-Gal-Chol incorporation is followed by degradation of the apolipoprotein in the lysosomes. It is concluded that Tris-Gal-Chol incorporation into LDL or HDL leads to a markedly increased catabolism of LDL by way of the Kupffer cells and HDL by parenchymal cells which might be used for lowering serum cholesterol levels. The use of Tris-Gal-Chol might also find application for targeting drugs or other compounds of interest to either Kupffer or parenchymal liver cells."

Cinnamic acid, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 4-methoxycinnamic acid, and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid were suitable substrates of chloroperoxidase, and were converted to 2-halo-3-hydroxycarboxylic acid, 2,3-dihydroxycarboxylic acid, decarboxylated halohydrin, or decarboxylated halocompound. However, 4-nitrocinnamic acid and 4-chlorocinnamic acid having electron-attracting groups did not serve as a substrate of the enzyme. The enzyme also did not act on acrylic acid, acrylamide, crotonic acid, fumaric acid, etc. From these data, the enzymatic reactions of chloroperoxidase, concerning the substrate specificity, stereoselectivity, and the reaction mechanism, are discussed on the basis of current knowledge regarding the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. Also they are compared with the chemical reactions of molecular halogen and hypohalous acid."
https://openalex.org/W1573346879,"Elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts) catalyzes the reaction EF-Tu X GDP + nucleotide diphosphate (NDP) reversible EF-Tu X NDP + GDP where NDP is GDP, IDP, GTP, or GMP X PCP. The EF-Ts-catalyzed exchange rates were measured at a series of concentrations of EF-Tu X [3H] GDP and free nucleotide. Plotting the rate data according to the Hanes method produced a series of lines intersecting on the ordinate, a characteristic of substituted enzyme mechanisms. GDP is a competitive inhibitor of IDP exchange, a result predicted for the substituted enzyme mechanism but inconsistent with ternary complex mechanisms that involve an intermediate complex containing EF-Ts and both substrates. The exchange of both GTP and the GTP analog GMP X PCP also follow the substituted enzyme mechanism. The maximal rates of exchange of GDP and GTP are the same, which indicates that the rates of dissociation of EF-Ts from EF-Tu X GDP and EF-Tu X GTP are the same. The steady-state maximal exchange rate is slower by a factor of 20 than the previously reported rate of dissociation of GDP from EF-Ts X EF-Tu. This is interpreted to mean that the rate-determining step in the exchange reaction is the dissociation of EF-Ts from EF-Tu X GDP."
https://openalex.org/W1491369579,"Abstract The exchange of anions across the erythrocyte membrane has been studied using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to monitor inorganic phosphate influx and 35Cl NMR to monitor chloride ion efflux. The 31P NMR resonances for intracellular Pi and extracellular Pi could be observed separately by adjusting the initial extracellular pH to 6.4, while the intracellular pH was 7.3. The 35Cl NMR resonance for intracellular Cl- was so broad as to be virtually undetectable (line width greater than 200 Hz), while that of extracellular Cl-is relatively narrow (line width of about 30 Hz). The transports of Pi and Cl-were both totally inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, a potent inhibitor of the band 3 protein. Since the 31P resonance of Pi varies with pH, intra- and extracellular pH changes could also be determined during anion transport. The extracellular pH rose and intracellular pH fell during anion transport, consistent with the protonated monoanionic H2PO4-form of Pi being transported into the erythrocyte rather than the deprotonated dianionic HPO24-form. The rates of Cl-efflux and Pi influx were determined quantitatively and were found to be in close agreement with values determined by isotope measurements. The Cl-efflux was found to coincide with the influx of the monoanionic H2PO4-form of Pi."
https://openalex.org/W1594202522,"The serum amyloid P component (SAP) has been found to associate in vitro with a variety of polysaccharide and proteinaceous ligands including the yeast cell wall polysaccharide preparation, zymosan, in the presence of calcium at neutral pH. In the present study, we have investigated the role of copper and zinc and other divalent cations and acidic pH on the binding of SAP to zymosan. We report that binding occurs not only in the presence of calcium, but in the presence of copper, zinc, and cadmium as well. No binding occurs in the absence of added metal, or in the presence of barium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese, or nickel. 125I-SAP binding in the presence of metals is inhibited by presaturating the zymosan surface with unlabeled SAP. Whereas calcium-mediated binding decreases by more than 50% as the pH is lowered to 5, copper-mediated binding increases substantially at the more acidic pH values while zinc-mediated binding is essentially unchanged. These data indicate that, in addition to calcium at neutral pH, copper (and zinc) at neutral and particularly acidic pH values mediates SAP binding to polysaccharide ligands. This suggests that SAP may well be considered a copper- as well as a calcium-dependent protein under certain conditions and that this reactivity is favored under those conditions of lowered pH which may result from metabolic processes occurring at local sites of inflammation."

This compound was the major product formed from [5-3H] 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid, incubated with intact plants or root and coleoptile sections. Identification was by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the trimethylsilyl derivative and by analysis of the hydrolysis products. A synthesis is reported for 7-hydroxy-2-oxindole-3-acetic acid. These results and prior work demonstrate the following catabolic route for indole-3-acetic acid in Zea: indole-3-acetic acid—-2-oxindole-3-acetic acid—-7-hydroxy-2-oxindole-3-acetic acid—-7-hydroxy-2-oxindole-3-acetic acid glucoside."
https://openalex.org/W96575372,"The synthesis and extracellular deposition of elastin by cultured neonatal rat aorta smooth muscle cells has been followed. The addition of beta-aminopropionitrile to the culture medium promotes accumulation of soluble precursors of elastin. Under such conditions, a protein possessing characteristics of a soluble elastin precursor with an apparent molecular weight of 77,000 was detected and partially purified. Pulse-chase studies suggested that this 77-kDa protein undergoes an extracellular, enzymatically catalyzed process to a 71-kDa protein. This 71-kDa protein is strikingly similar to tropoelastins isolated from other tissue systems, in which no evidence for higher molecular weight soluble precursors is at present available. Data presented in this communication suggest that the 77-kDa protein, which we have designated protropoelastin, represents a precursor to the tropoelastin moiety produced in the neonatal rat smooth muscle cell culture."

The molecular weight, determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, sucrose density gradient, and by gel filtration, was found to be 36,000. This protein kinase phosphorylates in vitro ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and glycogen synthase and does not phosphorylate phosphorylase, phosphorylase kinase, histone, phosvitin, and casein. It has Fa (activity factor) activity stimulating the ATP X Mg-dependent phosphatase and is therefore named a multifunctional protein kinase. This kinase differs from glycogen synthase kinase-3 with regard to substrate specificity, kinetic parameters, and physicochemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W276326461,"Hepatocytes, isolated from fasted rats, were incubated with graded concentrations of lactate and pyruvate, at a mean constant ratio of 10-13:1, to alter systematically the concentrations of gluconeogenic intermediate metabolites and rates of glucose production. By analyzing glucose production rates as a function of corresponding concentrations of extracellular pyruvate, cytosolic oxalacetate, and cellular 3-phosphoglycerate in the presence and absence of hormones and assuming no primary activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, estimates were made of the relative contributions of stimulation of formation of cytosolic oxalacetate and inhibition of pyruvate kinase to hormonal stimulations of gluconeogenesis. Addition of dexamethasone, glucagon, or angiotensin II did not cause a shift in the relationship between cellular 3-phosphoglycerate concentrations and rates of glucose production, indicating that there was no effect of these agents on the reactions involved in conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to glucose. All three agents shifted the relationships between rates of glucose production and both cytosolic oxalacetate and extracellular pyruvate. The following conclusions were drawn from computer analyses of these results. At low concentrations of pyruvate, stimulation of oxalacetate production and pyruvate kinase inhibition were approximately equally contributory to the overall stimulations of gluconeogenesis by angiotensin II and dexamethasone. At higher pyruvate concentrations, pyruvate kinase inhibition by angiotensin II played a greater role, accounting for 90% of the overall stimulation. For dexamethasone, as the pyruvate concentration was increased, stimulation of gluconeogenesis resulting from enhanced formation of oxalacetate diminished as did overall stimulation of gluconeogenesis. Glucagon addition resulted in an inhibition of pyruvate kinase flux that accounted for 75% of the hormone's overall effect at low pyruvate concentrations; this increased to 95% at high pyruvate concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1589159984,"N tau-Methylhistamine is a major inactive metabolite of histamine and is formed by histamine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.8). However, a controversy exists concerning the presence of other N-methylated histamines, such as N pi- and N alpha-methylhistamine in mammalian tissues. Indolethylamine N-methyltransferase is present in mammalian tissues with the rabbit lung containing the highest concentration, but the physiologic function of this enzyme remains unclear. Using rabbit lung as a tissue source, we purified indolethylamine N-methyltransferase 260-fold and separated it completely from histamine N-methyltransferase. Histamine was a substrate for purified indolethylamine N-methyltransferase and unlike histamine N-methyltransferase which exclusively formed N tau-methylhistamine, indolethylamine N-methyltransferase catalyzed the in vitro formation of both N pi-methylhistamine and N alpha-methylhistamine. In contrast to histamine N-methyltransferase, indolethylamine N-methyltransferase activity was not inhibited by either high histamine concentrations or by quinacrine. Thus, mammalian tissues contain an enzyme capable of forming N pi-methylhistamine and N alpha-methylhistamine. This supports the concept of the existence of these compounds and suggests they may serve a physiologic function in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1481862590,"We have screened sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus for reactivity with RNA transcribed in vitro using HeLa whole cell extracts. Sera from 14 out of 114 patients precipitated an RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III from a plasmid containing an Alu family sequence (i.e. the repetitive DNA sequence that is cut by the Alu restriction enzyme) located upstream from the human gamma G-globin gene. These Alu transcripts were not precipitated by anti-La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP or anti-Ro antibodies, suggesting that Alu RNA was precipitated by a previously undescribed lupus specificity. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled immunoprecipitates indicated that Alu RNA binds a protein of about 68 kDa. This protein may be Alu specific since three different Alu transcripts were precipitated by the anti-Alu sera whereas another RNA polymerase III transcript, adenovirus VA I RNA, was not precipitated by the same sera."
https://openalex.org/W1607625713,"Aspartate transcarbamoylase labeled with 3-fluorotyrosine was purified from an Escherichia coli strain which was auxotrophic for tyrosine and overproduced aspartate transcarbamoylase upon uracil starvation. The labeled enzyme in which about 85% of the tyrosines were replaced by fluorotyrosine exhibited high enzyme activity that varied in a sigmoidal manner with respect to the aspartate concentration. Also, the labeled enzyme was inhibited by CTP, activated by ATP, and exhibited a 2.6% decrease in sedimentation coefficient upon the addition of the active-site ligand, N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate. Thus, despite extensive replacement of tyrosines by fluorotyrosine, the modified enzyme was similar to native aspartate transcarbamoylase. The 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of isolated regulatory subunits labeled with fluorotyrosine consisted of a single peak. Addition of the activator, ATP, or the inhibitor, CTP, caused a loss of intensity at about 61.3 ppm upfield from a trifluoroacetic acid reference and an increase at about 61.5 ppm, but CTP also caused an increase at about 61.0 ppm. Five overlapping resonances were observed in the 19F NMR spectrum of unliganded catalytic subunits containing fluorotyrosine. Although the binding of the bisubstrate analog, N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate, or the combination of carbamoylphosphate and succinate caused similar disappearances of resonances, the addition of N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate caused the appearance of resonances not observed with carbamoylphosphate plus succinate. Carbamoylphosphate alone perturbed three or four resonances and the subsequent addition of succinate affected at least two."
https://openalex.org/W1555955059,"Upon irradiation by a light flash (100-J), the carbon monoxide complex of cytochrome P-450scc was fully photodissociated in both the presence and absence of cholesterol, while less than 20% of the CO complex was photodissociable with those of deoxycorticosterone-bound and -free forms of cytochrome P-45011 beta. When the quantum yield of the reaction was measured for each photodissociable portion, the values were 0.5 and 1.0 for the substrate-free and -bound forms of cytochrome P-450scc, and 0.03 and 0.8 for the substrate-free and -bound forms of cytochrome P-45011 beta, respectively. Thus, CO complexes of these enzymes become more photosensitive upon binding with the specific substrates. Steroid binding also affected kinetic constants of reactions between the ferrous enzymes and CO. The rate constants for the CO recombination at 15 degrees C were 2.7 X 10(6) and 2.3 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 for the substrate-free and -bound forms of cytochrome P-450scc, and were 7.0 X 10(5) and 5.4 X 10(3) M-1 s-1 for the substrate-free and -bound forms of cytochrome P-45011 beta, respectively. The rate constants for the CO dissociation also decreased upon the steroid bindings. The products of the enzyme reactions, pregnenolone and corticosterone, had similar effects on the kinetic constants. From these findings, we postulate that the binding of a steroid to the substrate site of each enzyme alters the bonding character of CO with the heme-iron, thereby affecting both photochemical and kinetic properties of the CO complex. The nature of the photoindissociable portion of the CO complex of cytochrome P-45011 beta is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1571256781,"Cell-cell adhesion is a multi-step process which may be initiated by binding of cell surface carbohydrates to complementary carbohydrate receptors on apposing cell surfaces. We have modeled such interactions using polyacrylamide gels covalently derivatized with glycosides, to which intact cells specifically adhere; chicken hepatocytes adhere to gels derivatized with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Initially adhesion is blocked (or reversed) by soluble GlcNAc, but becomes sugar-resistant rapidly at 37 degrees C, perhaps due to cellular modification of the carbohydrate-derivatized surface (Guarnaccia, S. P., Kuhlenschmidt, M. S., Slife, C. W., and Schnaar, R. L. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14293-14299). We report here that, subsequent to recognition and adhesion, intact chicken hepatocytes transfer phosphate covalently to GlcNAc-derivatized gels. Metabolically radiolabeled cells (32Pi) were incubated on polyacrylamide gels derivatized with various aminohexyl glycosides. Noncovalently bound material was then removed from the gels by extensive washing in detergents and salt solutions. Subsequent radiochemical analysis revealed that phosphate was transferred selectively to GlcNAc-derivatized gels (up to 20-fold more than to glucose-, galactose-, or mannose-derivatized gels). Soluble GlcNAc (but not other sugars) or low temperature inhibited phosphate transfer. The phosphorylation was mediated by intact cells; cell lysate was itself incapable of specific phosphate transfer and attenuated specific transfer when added to intact cells. When GlcNAc was immobilized using a cleavable (disulfide-containing) linker arm the transferred phosphate radiolabel could be solubilized by disulfide reduction and recovered for further analysis. The released phosphorylated product migrated as a single low molecular weight species upon gel permeation chromatography, paper electrophoresis, and cellulose thin layer chromatography. Acid hydrolysis of the phosphorylated product generated a compound with the mobility of GlcNAc-6-P in five different separation systems. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase converted the radiolabel to a compound with the properties of inorganic phosphate. These data indicate that; subsequent to carbohydrate recognition and adhesion, intact hepatocytes generate phosphomonoesters of recognized carbohydrates outside of their plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2266996673,"Resonance Raman spectroscopy has been employed to detect the iron-proximal histidine stretching mode in deoxyhemoglobins from insect larvae of Chironomus thummi thummi (CTT). With the excitation of 413.1 nm, we observe a sharp and intense line in the 220-224 cm-1 region. The assignment of this line to the Fe-N epsilon (His) stretching mode was made on the basis of a 3-cm-1 shift upon 57Fe/54Fe isotope substitution. The Fe-N epsilon (His) vibration is used to monitor the possible changes in the Fe-N epsilon (His) bond strength (hence bone length) in the deoxy state of the monomeric (CTT I, III, and IV) and dimeric (CTT II) insect hemoglobins. As these hemoglobins differ in O2 affinity, off-rate and on-rate constants, and in the Bohr effect, they are excellent model systems for investigating the mechanism of protein control of the heme reactivity. Some of these hemoglobins (CTT III, IV, and II) are allosteric, exhibiting two interconvertible conformational states with high and low O2 affinity at high and low pH, respectively. The Fe-N epsilon (His) stretching frequency does not correlate with the O2 affinity, the on-rate and the off-rate constants for different hemoglobins, for different conformational states, and for modified hemoglobins with different heme peripheral groups. This vibrational mode is insensitive to deuteration of the heme vinyl groups. It is important to note that the Fe-N epsilon (His) bonds in the high pH (high-affinity) and the low pH (low-affinity) states are identical. This implies that the O2 molecule, prior to binding, sees identical binding sites. Thus, the difference in free energy changes upon O2 binding is manifested only in the oxy form."
https://openalex.org/W251993673,"We have demonstrated that tubulin-GTP subunits can react with microtubule ends containing subunits with E-site-bound GDP. This observation can be taken to rule out a previous interpretation of a biphasic dependence of the rate for subunit flux into microtubules on the subunit concentration, which is based upon an assumption that GTP is required to be present in subunits at microtubule ends in order to allow addition of tubulin-GTP subunits. The nullified mechanism had been suggested to be the basis of the observation that growing and shrinking microtubules coexist as independent species. We have also confirmed previous studies indicating that the flux rate is nonlinearly dependent on the subunit concentration and account for this behavior by assuming that tubulin-GTP subunits reversibly add to microtubule ends by two paths. In one, tubulin-GTP subunits add nonproductively to generate an end which is unable to undergo further net microtubule elongation; however, this reaction can retard the rate for microtubule disassembly under conditions where the disassembly reaction predominates. In the other, tubulin-GTP subunits add productively to microtubule ends to generate ends which can undergo subsequent net elongation."

Our data indicate that phorbol-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (but not 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate) induces both a specific platelet shape change and the preferential phosphorylation of a 180-kDa protein (presumably due to the activation of protein kinase C on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane). Further analysis reveals that the 180-kDa protein can be iodinated by lactoperoxidase and is sensitive to trypsin treatment, indicating exposure of this protein on the outer cell surface. The 180-kDa protein has also been found to contain wheat germ agglutinin-binding sites. All evidence indicates that the 180-kDa polypeptide is a transmembrane glycoprotein and, most importantly, that this protein is found to be preferentially accumulated into a specific membrane-cytoskeleton complex during activation via phorbol-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate treatment. We believe that the observed phosphorylation of this protein may be closely related to the formation of a complex between several membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton during the initial stages of platelet activation."

For the valine adducts, a detailed study has been carried out on solutions at pH and pD 5, 9, and 13, values at which the pyridine and imine protons are successively ionized, and on the adducts formed from 15N-valine, alpha-deuterovaline, and N-methyl-PLP. Good quality spectra were obtained, despite the strong fluorescence of pyridoxal Schiff bases, by adding KI as a quencher, and by exciting the molecules on the blue side of their absorption bands: 406.7 nm (cw Kr+ laser) for the pH 5 and 9 species (lambda max = 409 and 414 nm), and 354.7 nm (pulsed YAG laser, third harmonic) for the pH 13 species (lambda max = 360 nm). A prominent band at 1646 cm-1 is assigned to the imine C=N stretch via its 13 cm-1 15N shift. A 12 cm-1 down-shift of the band in D2O confirms that the Schiff base linkage is protonated at pH 9. Deprotonation at pH 13 shifts VC = N from 1646 to 1629 cm-1, values typical of conjugated Schiff bases. The strongest band in the spectrum, at 1338 cm-1, shifts to 1347 cm-1 upon pyridine protonation at pH 5, and is assigned to a ring mode with a large component of phenolate C-O stretch. A shoulder on its low-frequency side is assigned to the C4-C4' stretch. Large enhancements of these modes can be understood qualitatively in terms of the dominant resonance structures contributing to the ground and resonant excited states. A number of weaker bands are observed, and assigned to pyridine ring modes. These modes gain significantly in intensity, while the exocyclic modes diminish, when the spectra are excited at 266 nm (YAG laser, fourth harmonic) in resonance with ring-localized electronic transitions."

https://openalex.org/W1561343573,"Abstract 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to study communication between the catalytic and regulatory subunits in aspartate transcarbamoylase of Escherichia coli. Hybrid enzymes composed of fluorotyrosine-labeled regulatory subunits and native catalytic subunits or of native regulatory subunits and fluorotyrosine-labeled catalytic subunits were constructed and shown to have the allosteric kinetic properties of native enzyme. These hybrids exhibited the ligand-promoted global conformational changes characteristic of native aspartate transcarbamoylase and alterations in the NMR spectrum when ligands bind to the active site. The NMR difference spectrum caused by the binding of the bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate to the hybrid containing 19F-labeled regulatory chains consisted of two troughs and a peak, suggesting that two tyrosines in the regulatory polypeptide chains were affected by the binding of ligand to the catalytic subunits. The increase in magnitude of the peak appeared to depend directly on the fractional saturation of the active sites. A peak with two distinct shoulders was observed in the 19F NMR spectrum of the hybrid containing fluorotyrosine in the catalytic chains when it was saturated with the ligand, whereas the spectrum for the unliganded enzyme consisted of a single peak. The NMR difference spectrum showed that the bisubstrate ligand perturbed at least two resonances, and these changes appeared to be tightly linked to the binding of the ligand."
