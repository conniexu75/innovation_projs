https://openalex.org/W1983324758,"Soils in many areas suppress certain plant diseases. Understanding the basis for this disease suppressiveness could lead to improved plant health in less favorable areas. Some forms of disease suppression may be caused by bacteria in the genus Pseudomonas which aggressively colonize root surfaces. Increased plant growth and yield are closely associated with the capacity of some of these bacteria to produce iron-binding compounds called siderophores. This article addresses the biological characteristics of these soil-bome root epiphytes, their contribution to plant health, and their potential use in biotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W2074112372,"Continuous enrichment of an arctic river with only 10 parts per billion phosphate-phosphorus caused an immediate growth of attached algae for more than 10 kilometers downstream, showing that phosphorus alone limited photosynthesis. As a result of the increased photosynthesis, there was an increase in bacterial activity in films on rocks on the bottom of the stream. The major source of energy became the photosynthetic carbon fixed in the stream rather than the organic material entering from the surrounding tundra, and the overall metabolism of the stream shifted from heterotrophy to autotrophy. An increase in the size and developmental stage of some of the dominant aquatic insects illustrates the food limitation in this nutrient-poor habitat."

Measurements of the methane concentration in air extracted by two different methods from ice samples from Siple Station in western Antarcitica allow the reconstruction of the history of the increase of the atmospheric methane during the past 200 years.
https://openalex.org/W2015732961,"Recent excavations at the deeply stratified Late Pleistocene cave site of Tabun on Mount Carmel have, yielded a long sequence of Middle and Lower Paleolithic industries and associated geological and environmental evidence that has important implications for the understanding of man's cultural and biological development in that period. An analysis of these materials strongly supports a continuity in cultural development at this site from about 130,000 to 50,000 years ago and suggests that a continuous biological evolution from Neandeithal to anatomically modem Homo sapiens took place in the southern Levant."
https://openalex.org/W2054222161,"Studies of multiphoton ionization of atoms have revealed several unexpected characteristics. The confluence of the experimental evidence leads to the hypothesis that the basic character of the atomic response involves highly organized, coherent motions of entire atomic shells. The important regime, for which the radiative field strength is greater than an atomic unit (e/a(2)(0)), can be viewed in approximate correspondence with the physics of fast (approximately 10 MeV per atomic mass unit) atom-atom scattering. This physical picture provides a basis for the expectation that stimulated emission in the x-ray range can be produced by direct, highly nonlinear coupling of ultraviolet radiation to atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2012438598,"The frequency spectrum for the low-frequency eddy kinetic energy is estimated from a long-term current meter record obtained in a deep layer in the western North Pacific. The eddy field is characterized by three time scales: an ""annual scale"" with zonal dominance of eddy motions, a ""temporal mesoscale"" with meridional dominance, and a ""monthly scale"" with horizontal isotropy. About two-thirds of the eddy kinetic energy is contained in the temporal mesoscale."

https://openalex.org/W1978216755,"Elephant beetles (Megasoma elephas; Scarabaeidae) weighing from 10 to 35 grams, respond homeothermically when ambient temperature is reduced below about 20 degrees C in the laboratory. This metabolic response is not associated with locomotion or any other overt activity. Warming is initiated when the body temperature reaches an apparent set point of 20 degrees to 22 degrees C. Unlike the case for euthermic birds and mammals, energy metabolism and body temperature in these beetles are conspicuously oscillatory, with a given cycle in oxygen consumption peaking before the corresponding cycle in body temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2085304795,Destratification in the York River during high spring tides is the result of the interruption of normal two-layer estuarine flow by the advection of relatively fresh water into the river mouth from the Chesapeake Bay. This advection is due to the presence of a longitudinal salinity gradient in the bay and a difference in the tidal current phase between the river and the bay. Similar behavior is seen in other subestuaries of the Chesapeake Bay and may be common in subestuary-estuary interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2052966527,"A polished section of lunar sample 14425, an 8 mm glass bead, was studied using a scanning electron microscope and energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer. The silicon, aluminum, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, titanium, and chromium contents of the glass were determined. Two types of glass are visible in the polished section. One is clear and almost devoid of metallic spherules, while the other is cloudy and contains numerous metallic spherules, some less than one micron in size. Both glass types are homogeneous and identical in composition. This composition closely matches that of some Apollo 14 breccias or glass found in the breccias. The apparent similarity in composition between lunar sample 14425 and the high-magnesium microtektites found in a previous study was probably due to charging effects during analyses in which the sample was uncoated."
