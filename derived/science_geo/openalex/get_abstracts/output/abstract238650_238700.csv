Biomarkers diagnostic for anoxygenic photosynthesis by Chlorobiaceae are particularly abundant at the boundary and into the Early Triassic. Similar conditions prevailed in the contemporaneous seas off South China. Our evidence for widespread photiczone euxinic conditions suggests that sulfide toxicity was a driver of the extinction and a factor in the protracted recovery."

Paleomagnetic/magnetostratigraphic and carbon-isotope data allow sections to be correlated across the basin. With this stratigraphy, the vertebrate fossil data show a gradual extinction in the Upper Permian punctuated by an enhanced extinction pulse at the Permian-Triassic boundary interval, particularly among the dicynodont therapsids, coinciding with negative carbon-isotope anomalies."

Here, we report that Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a key antioxidant enzyme whose mutations have been linked to autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a major target of oxidative damage in AD and PD brains. By using a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoblot analysis, and mass spectrometry, we have identified four human brain SOD1 isoforms with pI values of 6.3, 6.0, 5.7, and 5.0, respectively. Of these, the SOD1 pI 6.0 isoform is oxidatively modified by carbonylation, and the pI 5.0 isoform is selectively accumulated in AD and PD. Moreover, Cys-146, a cysteine residue of SOD1 that is mutated in familial ALS, is oxidized to cysteic acid in AD and PD brains. Quantitative Western blot analyses demonstrate that the total level of SOD1 isoforms is significantly increased in both AD and PD. Furthermore, immunohistochemical and double fluorescence labeling studies reveal that SOD1 forms proteinaceous aggregates that are associated with amyloid senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD brains. These findings implicate, for the first time, the involvement of oxidative damage to SOD1 in the pathogenesis of sporadic AD and PD. This work suggests that AD, PD, and ALS may share a common or overlapping pathogenic mechanism(s) that could potentially be targeted by similar therapeutic strategies.

Parkinson disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; also known as Lou Gehrig disease) are chronic neurodegenerative disorders characterized by selective neuronal death and the accumulation of insoluble proteinaceous deposits, such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD, Lewy bodies in PD, and hyaline- and skein-like inclusion bodies in ALS (1Ciechanover A.

Med. 2004; 10: S2-S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of these slowly progressive neurodegenerative diseases (3Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 4Beal M.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 5Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). For example, both AD and PD have been associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species, which could result from genetic predisposition and/or environmental factors, such as exposure to pesticides (4Beal M.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Post-mortem analyses reveal that the overall levels of oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA are elevated in AD and PD brains (6Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 7Jenner P. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53 (discussion S36-S38): S26-S36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). The most widely used marker for oxidative damage to proteins is the presence of carbonyl groups, which can be introduced into proteins by direct oxidation of Pro, Arg, Lys, and Thr side chains or by Michael addition reactions with products of lipid peroxidation or glycooxidation (3Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Elevation in the total level of protein carbonyls has been documented in both AD and PD (6Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 7Jenner P. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53 (discussion S36-S38): S26-S36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). However, the identities of the oxidized proteins modified by carbonylation or other types of oxidation remain largely unknown. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether the protein targets of oxidative damage are the same or different in AD and PD. As a first step toward a molecular understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, we performed a search for specific protein targets of oxidative damage in AD and PD brains by using a proteomic approach that combined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunological detection of protein oxidation, and mass spectrometry (8Choi J.

Here we report that Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1; EC 1.15.1.1) is a major target of oxidative damage in AD and PD brains. SOD1 is a key antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide radicals into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which is then decomposed by catalase and glutathione peroxidase (9Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar). Mutations in SOD1 have been identified as the cause for autosomal dominant familial form of ALS, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain (10Rosen D.R.

However, little is currently known about the role of SOD1 in the more common, sporadic form of ALS and in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD. In the present study, we investigated the changes in the expression, localization, and oxidative modifications of SOD1 in the brains of patients with idiopathic AD or PD. Our results suggest that oxidative damage to and aggregation of SOD1 play a crucial role in the neurodegeneration associated with AD and PD. Human Brain Samples—Frontal cortex tissues from five clinically diagnosed PD patients, five AD patients, and five healthy non-demented control subjects (Table I) were obtained from the Emory Alzheimer Disease Center brain bank. The neuropathological diagnosis of PD was based on the presence of nigral degeneration and Lewy bodies. The diagnosis of AD was established using Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease (CERAD) criteria (13Mirra S.S. Heyman A. McKeel D. Sumi S.M. Crain B.J. Brownlee L.M. Vogel F.S.

Open table in a new tab Sample Preparation, DNP Derivatization, and Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Brain tissues were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm bestatin), followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Protein samples (350 μg) were applied to 17-cm immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 4–7) in an immobilized pH gradient re-swelling tray, and the strips were then isoelectrically focused on a Protein IEF Cell (Bio-Rad) for 24,000 V-h (15Choi J. Malakowsky C.A. Talent J.M. Conrad C.C. Gracy R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Following isoelectric focusing, the strips were immediately subjected to in-strip DNP derivatization as described previously (16Conrad C.C. Choi J. Malakowsky C.A. Talent J.M. Dai R. Marshall P. Gracy R.W. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) by a 15-min incubation in 2 N HCl/10 mm 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine at 25 °C. After being washed with 2 m Tris base/30% (v/v) glycerol for 15 min, the strips were equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) containing 6 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.0% (w/v) dithiothreitol. The strips were then reequilibrated for 15 min in the same buffer containing 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide instead of dithiothreitol. Second-dimension separation was performed on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (10–20% porosity polyacrylamide) using the Ettan-DALT slab gel SDS-PAGE system (Amersham Biosciences). SYPRO Ruby Staining—Duplicate samples of brain proteins were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described above. Proteins in one gel were stained with SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain (Bio-Rad), whereas proteins in the other gel were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the Ettan-DALT system. For SYPRO Ruby staining, proteins were first fixed in the gel using 40% methanol/10% acetic acid (v/v) for 30 min. The gel was then incubated in SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain solution overnight and subsequently destained using 10% methanol/6% acetic acid (v/v) for 45 min. The SYPRO Ruby-stained gel was placed in a light-tight cabinet directly on a transilluminator, and the fluorescence generated by excitation with UV light at 365 nm was recorded using a cooled, computerized charge-coupled device camera-based imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Immunoblotting and Image Analyses—The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were removed from the Ettan-DALT electroblotting apparatus and incubated for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% (v/v) Tween and 5% (w/v) nonfat dried skim milk (PBS-TM). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-DNP primary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a 1:16,000 dilution or with anti-SOD1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:2000 dilution as described previously (17Choi J. Conrad C.C. Malakowsky C.A. Talent J.M. Yuan C.S. Gracy R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1571: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After extensive washing with PBS-TM, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a 1:16,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma). Immunostained proteins were detected by using a SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and an Alpha Innotech imaging system. Digitized images from SYPRO Rubystained gels and immunoblots were analyzed using the two-dimensional electrophoresis gel analysis program PD Quest (Bio-Rad). The data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance. Mass Spectrometry—Spots of interest were excised from the gels and digested in situ with trypsin (modified; Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting digests were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and capillary HPLC-electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR. The peptide mass maps produced by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were searched against the published databases by means of Mascot (Matrix Science) and the MS Fit component of Protein Prospector (prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/msfit.htm). Electrospray ionization mass spectra were acquired on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer adapted for microspray ionization sample introduction. On-line HPLC separation of the tryptic peptides was accomplished with a Michrom MAGIC 2002 micro HPLC: column, PicoFrit™ (New Objective; 75-μm inner diameter) packed to 10 cm with C18 adsorbent (Vydac; 218MSB5; 5 μm, 300 Å); mobile phase A, 0.5% acetic acid/0.005% trifluoroacetic acid; mobile phase B, 90% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid/0.005% trifluoroacetic acid; linear gradient of 2–72% B in 30 min; flow rate, 0.4 μl/min. As a part of the data-dependent acquisition protocol, the four most intense ions in each survey scan were sequentially fragmented in the ion trap by collision-induced dissociation using an isolation width of 2.5 and a relative collision energy of 35%. Uninterpreted MS/MS spectra were analyzed by the SEQUEST component of the LCQ software and by Mascot (Matrix Science). Assignment of the MS/MS fragments was verified by comparison with the predicted ions generated in silico by GPMAW (Lighthouse Data). Immunohistochemistry—Brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected in sucrose, and serial sections (50 μm) of cingulate cortex were cut on a cryostat. Sections were treated with 3% H2O2 to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity and blocked with a solution containing 8% goat serum, 10 μg/ml avidin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.9% NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-SOD1 antibody (0.5 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) or monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody (4G8; 1:5000; Signet) followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200). Bound antibodies were detected using a standard avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex method (Vectastain Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories). Sections were observed using a Leica DC500 microscope, and images were captured with a C4742-95 Hamamatsu digital camera. Double Fluorescence Labeling Confocal Microscopy—Brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer disease were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2–3 days. Blocks of cingulate cortex were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and frozen sections were cut on a sliding microtome at 50 μm. Sections were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, treated with 3% H2O2, and blocked with normal horse serum (8%), avidin (10 μg/ml), and Triton X-100 (0.1%) in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h before incubation with mouse monoclonal antibody to SOD1 (1 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) in Tris-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml biotin for 2 days at 4 °C. Following Tris-buffered saline rinses, sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories), followed by detection using the avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex method. Signal amplification was achieved using tyramide-Cy3 reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sections were counterstained with 1% thioflavin S (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min, rinsed in 70% ethanol, and coverslipped. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope. Molecular Characterization of Altered Protein Oxidative Modification in AD and PD Brains—To investigate alterations in protein oxidation associated with AD and PD, we performed comparative high-resolution, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments on protein samples obtained from AD and PD brains and age-matched controls (Table I). Brain protein extracts were resolved by isoelectric focusing on an immobilized pH gradient strip followed by in-strip DNP derivatization (reacting with protein carbonyls) and second-dimensional separation by SDS-PAGE. Total proteins in the two-dimensional gels were visualized by staining with SYPRO Ruby, and oxidatively modified proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-DNP antibody. Comparison of anti-DNP immunoblots with SYPRO Ruby-stained two-dimensional gels revealed that a protein spot that electrophoresed on the two-dimensional gel with apparent molecular mass/pI values of 16 kDa/6.0 exhibited enhanced oxidation in AD and PD brains (Fig. 1). Quantification results showed that the specific oxidation level of this spot was increased ∼7.5-fold in AD and 9-fold in PD compared with age-matched control brains (Table II).Table IIIncreased oxidation of the 16-kDa/pI 6.0 protein spot in PD and AD brains compared to controlsSamples (n = 5)Specific oxidation indexControl4.9 ± 0.9PD44.2 ± 8.9ap < 0.05AD36.5 ± 6.0ap < 0.05a p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab Identification of SOD1 as a Major Target of Oxidative Damage in AD and PD Brains by Mass Spectrometry—For determination of the identity of the oxidized protein spot indicated in Fig. 1, the spot was excised from the two-dimensional gels, and its identity was determined by mass spectrometric analysis. The spot was unambiguously identified as human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1; GenBank™ accession number NP_000445; Swiss-Prot accession number P00441) by using HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 2). This assignment is further strengthened by the agreement between the apparent molecular mass/pI values (16 kDa/6.0) of the protein spot and the predicted values of 15.9 kDa/5.7 for human SOD1. Mass spectrometric data indicated that Cys-146, a cysteine residue in the C-terminal region of SOD1, was oxidized to cysteic acid (also known as cysteine sulfonic acid, Cys-SO3H) in AD and PD brains (Fig. 2). Immunoblot Analysis Reveals the Presence of Four Brain SOD1 Isoforms and Confirms the Identified Oxidized Protein as the SOD1 pI 6.0 Isoform—To confirm the protein identification result obtained by mass spectrometry, we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of human brain samples followed by immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal anti-SOD1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, anti-SOD1 antibody specifically recognized four distinct protein spots with the same molecular mass (16 kDa) and different isoelectric points (pI = 6.3, 6.0, 5.7, and 5.0, respectively), demonstrating the presence of four SOD1 isoforms in human brain. Of these four SOD1 spots, only one spot (pI = 6.0) was immunoreactive to anti-DNP antibody, indicating that the pI 6.0 isoform of SOD1 was oxidatively modified by carbonyl formation (Fig. 3, A and B). The specific oxidation of the 16-kDa/pI 6.0 SOD1 spot is consistent with the results described in Fig. 1. The SOD1 pI 5.0 Isoform Is Selectively Accumulated in AD and PD Brains—We next examined whether or not the four SOD1 isoforms were differentially expressed in AD, PD, and control brains by two-dimensional immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4, A-C). Quantification results (Fig. 4D) showed a more than 6-fold increase in the relative level of the pI 5.0 isoform of SOD1 in AD and PD brains compared with age-matched controls. The different isoelectric points of the SOD1 isoforms (Fig. 4) suggest the presence of some types of post-translational modification that alter the charge of SOD1 protein. To test this possibility, the four different pI spots of SOD1 were individually excised from the two-dimensional gels, and their tryptic digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS/MS and HPLC-ESI/MS/MS. Despite repeated attempts, efforts to identify the post-translational modification that causes the pI shifts of SOD1 have so far been unsuccessful. The Total Level of SOD1 Protein Is Increased in AD and PD Brains—Our two-dimensional immunoblotting data (Fig. 4) suggest that the total level of all four SOD1 isoforms is increased in AD and PD brains. To further investigate this possibility, we performed quantitative Western blot analysis using protein samples obtained from AD and PD brains and age-matched controls (Table I). The fact that all four SOD1 isoforms have the same molecular mass (Fig. 3) allowed us to use one-dimensional gel electrophoresis for direct comparison of the total SOD1 levels of various brain samples on the same gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against SOD1 and actin. The relative level of SOD1 in each sample was measured by quantification of the intensity of the SOD1 band and normalized to the actin level in the corresponding sample (Fig. 5). The results indicated that the total level of SOD1 was increased 2.4-fold in PD brains and 2.5-fold in AD brains compared with controls. Accumulation of SOD1 Protein Aggregates in AD Brains— Oxidative modification may convert proteins into forms that are more prone to aggregation and/or more resistant to proteolytic degradation, resulting in the formation of protein aggregates (18Stadtman E.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 22-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Because our biochemical data revealed that SOD1 was significantly oxidized and accumulated in AD and PD brains, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate whether SOD1 aggregates in these diseases. In control human brains, intense SOD1 immunoreactivity was observed in pyramidal neurons in addition to moderately stained neurons and neuropils throughout the neocortex (Fig. 6A). Strong SOD1 immunostaining was also found in astrocytes in white matter (Fig. 6B). PD brains exhibited similar SOD1 immunostaining patterns compared with the controls (data not shown). However, aggregation of SOD1 protein was occasionally seen in the cytoplasm of some neurons (Fig. 6C), although we did not detect SOD1 immunoreactivity in Lewy bodies of PD brains (data not shown). In AD brains, prominent SOD1 immunoreactivity was observed in aggregates with granular or globular appearances (Fig. 6, D and E). Many of these SOD1-positive deposits had diameters similar to amyloid plaques labeled by anti-Aβ antibody in adjacent brain sections (Fig. 6F). SOD1 Aggregates Are Associated with Senile Plaques and Neurofibrillary Tangles in AD Brains—To further characterize SOD1 aggregates, we performed double fluorescence labeling experiments using anti-SOD1 antibody and thioflavin S, a widely used dye that binds to fibrillar, β-pleated sheet structures. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, there was very little overlap between SOD1 immunostaining and thioflavin S labeling, suggesting that SOD1 aggregates per se are amorphous protein deposits with little fibrillar, β-pleated sheet content. However, SOD1 aggregates were closely associated with thioflavin S-positive amyloid plaques (Fig. 7) and neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Association of SOD1 aggregates with neurofibrillary tangles in AD brains. Sections of cingulate cortical regions from AD brains were stained with anti-SOD1 antibody (A, D, G, and J) and thioflavin S (B, E, H, and K). Images were obtained by confocal microscopy. Superimposed images (C, F, I, and L) revealed the association of SOD1 aggregates with thioflavin S-positive neurofibrillary tangles.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar, 19Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The importance of SOD1 in neurodegeneration was first discovered by the identification of more than 100 different point mutations in SOD1 as causative genetic defects for familial ALS (20Guegan C. Przedborski S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that SOD1 is one of the major targets of oxidative damage in AD and PD brains and provided evidence supporting the involvement of oxidative damage to and aggregation of SOD1 in the two common neurodegenerative disorders AD and PD. By using a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoblot analysis, and mass spectrometry, we have identified four human brain SOD1 isoforms with pI values of 6.3, 6.0, 5.7, and 5.0, respectively. The chemical nature of the modifications responsible for the differences in the pI value of the SOD1 isoforms remains to be determined. It is possible that some of the SOD1 pI isoforms represent differentially metallated forms of SOD1. SOD1 is a homodimeric metalloprotein containing one Cu(II) and one Zn(II) ion per subunit (19Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). SOD1 protein is known to first fold into a dimeric apo form and then acquires Cu(II) from the copper chaperone for SOD1 (21Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of the Zn(II) acquisition is not yet known, Zn-deficient wild-type and mutant SOD1 have been implicated in ALS (19Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 22Julien J.P. Cell. 2001; 104: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The predicted pI of SOD1 in its metallated holo form, partially metallated form (Cu-free or Zn-free state), and metal-free apo form is 6.4, 6.0, and 5.7, respectively. We observed that in the control human brains, SOD1 exists mainly in three isoforms (pI = 6.3, 6.0, and 5.7), of which the pI 6.0 and pI 5.7 isoforms are most abundant, accounting for about 55% and 35% of total SOD1 protein, respectively. The observed pI 6.0 isoform is likely to be the metallated holo form of SOD1, whereas the pI 5.7 isoform may represent the partially metallated form. Consistent with this assumption, copper incorporation experiments revealed that the Cu-free form of SOD1 constitutes ∼35% of the total SOD1 in human lymphoblasts (23Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our data showed no significant change in the relative levels of pI 6.3, pI 6.0, and pI 5.7 isoforms of SOD1 in AD and PD brains compared with age-matched controls. In contrast, the level of the more acidic SOD1 isoform (pI = 5.0) is increased more than 6-fold in AD and PD brains. The selective accumulation of the acidic SOD1 pI isoform is analogous to the acidic pI shift of familial PD-associated DJ-1 protein in response to oxidative stress (24Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Takeuchi A. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Takanezawa Y. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 25Canet-Aviles R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C.

In the case of DJ-1, the acid pI shift is thought to result from direct oxidation of DJ-1 by H2O2, leading to the formation of cysteine sulfinic or sulfonic acid (24Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Takeuchi A. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Takanezawa Y. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 25Canet-Aviles R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C.

A similar oxidative modification of SOD1 might be responsible for accumulation of the acidic SOD1 pI 5.0 isoform in AD and PD brains. Our proteomic results indicated that the SOD1 pI 6.0 isoform, but not the other three SOD1 isoforms (pI = 6.3, 5.7, and 5.0), is heavily oxidized in AD and PD brains by carbonylation, an irreversible oxidative modification that is widely used as a marker of oxidative damage (3Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A 7.5–9-fold increase in the specific oxidation level of the SOD1 pI 6.0 isoform was observed in AD and PD brains compared with age-matched control brains, providing the first direct evidence for occurrence of oxidative damage to SOD1 in sporadic AD and PD. In addition, we found that Cys-146 of the SOD1 pI 6.0 isoform is oxidized irreversibly to cysteine sulfonic acid in AD and PD brains. Cysteine contains a thiol group (Cys-SH) that can be reversibly oxidized to a sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) or sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) by low concentrations of H2O2 and irreversibly oxidized to a sulfonic acid (Cys-SO3H) by high concentrations of H2O2 (26Claiborne A.

Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C246-C256Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The identified irreversible cysteine oxidation of SOD1 is consistent with previous in vitro studies showing that SOD1 undergoes oxidative damage by its own reaction product H2O2 (29Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2405-2410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kurahashi T. Miyazaki A. Suwan S. Isobe M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9268-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The vulnerability of SOD1 to H2O2-mediated oxidative damage underscores the importance of H2O2 clearance by catalase and peroxidases. Elevated levels of H2O2 in the brain have been implicated in AD and PD (6Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Aβ peptide can directly catalyze the production of H2O2in vitro, suggesting that Aβ deposits may be a source of H2O2 in AD brain (31Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I.

The increased H2O2 levels in AD and PD may overwhelm the cellular H2O2 defense systems, leading to various oxidative products, including oxidized SOD1. Our findings raise a possibility that the identified oxidative modifications of SOD1 might contribute to the pathogenesis of sporadic AD and PD in a manner similar to the genetic mutations of SOD1 in causing neurodegeneration in familial ALS. In agreement with this possibility, Cys-146, a cysteine residue that we found to be irreversibly oxidized in AD and PD brains, is mutated to an arginine (C146R) in familial ALS (33de Belleroche J. Orrell R. King A. J. Med. Genet. 1995; 32: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Ample evidence indicates that SOD1 mutations cause neurodegeneration by a gain of cytotoxic function, rather than a loss of enzymatic activity (19Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 20Guegan C. Przedborski S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing familial ALS-associated mutant SOD1 develop severe motor neuron degeneration (34Gurney M.E. Pu H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.X. Chen W. Zhai P. Sufit R.L. Siddique T. Science. 1994; 264: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar), whereas neither transgenic mice expressing the human wild-type SOD1 (35Jaarsma D. Haasdijk E.D. Grashorn J.A. Hawkins R. van Duijn W. Verspaget H.W. London J. Holstege J.C. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 623-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) nor SOD1 knock-out mice (36Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown Jr., R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) exhibit such an ALS-like phenotype. The mechanism by which SOD1 mutants cause neurodegeneration is not understood, but it has been suggested that the toxic gain of function is a consequence of mutation-induced misfolding of SOD1, which leads to the formation of cytotoxic SOD1 aggregates (11Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 19Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The oxidative modifications of SOD1 identified in AD and PD brains may induce misfolding and/or protease resistance of SOD1, thereby promoting the accumulation and aggregation of SOD1. In support of this possibility, we found that the total level of SOD1 protein is significantly increased in both AD and PD. Moreover, we observed the presence of prominent SOD1-immunoreactive protein aggregates in AD brains. These aggregates are unlikely to be nonspecific staining artifacts of the anti-SOD1 antibody because similar SOD1 aggregates have been observed in AD brains using different anti-SOD1 antibodies (37Furuta A. Price D.L. Pardo C.A. Troncoso J.C. Xu Z.S. Taniguchi N. Martin L.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 357-367PubMed Google Scholar). Although we were unable to detect SOD1 immunostaining in Lewy bodies in our PD samples, the previously reported association of SOD1 with Lewy bodies (38Nishiyama K. Murayama S. Shimizu J. Ohya Y. Kwak S. Asayama K. Kanazawa I. Acta Neuropathol. 1995; 89: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) is consistent with our hypothesis. We have further characterized SOD1 aggregates in AD brains by double fluorescence labeling confocal microscopy and found that these aggregates are not stained with thioflavin S, indicating that SOD1 aggregates are not fibrillar amyloid deposits. The granular morphology and non-fibrillar nature of SOD1 aggregates in AD brains resemble the SOD1-positive inclusion bodies found in both familial and sporadic forms of ALS (12Bruijn L.I. Miller T.M. Cleveland D.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 39Okamoto K. Hirai S. Yamazaki T. Sun X.Y. Nakazato Y. Neurosci.

Amyotroph Lateral Scler. Other Motor Neuron Disord. 2000; 1: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In AD brains, we found that SOD1 aggregates are closely associated with amyloid senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The co-occurrence of SOD1 aggregates with the hallmark lesions of AD and PD suggests a common or overlapping mechanism(s) underlying the formation of pathological inclusions in AD, PD, and ALS. Although the genetic defects underlying some of the rare familial forms of AD, PD, and ALS have recently been identified, the causes of the common, sporadic forms of these diseases remain unclear. Our work suggests that oxidative damage to and subsequent aggregation of SOD1 may contribute to the neurodegeneration associated with AD and PD. It would be worthwhile to determine whether the identified oxidative modifications of SOD1 also take place in sporadic ALS. The overlapping pathogenic mechanisms of these neurodegenerative diseases raise an exciting possibility that similar potential therapeutic strategies might be utilized for treating these disorders.

Even so, major advances have been made in the understanding of monogenic forms of the disease which together represent a substantial health burden, and a few common gene variants that influence susceptibility have now been unequivocally identified. Armed with a better understanding of the tools needed to detect such genes, it seems inevitable that the rate of progress will increase and the relevance of genetic information to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diabetes will become increasingly tangible."

LAT3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes induces system L2-like transport activity. Several features distinguish LAT3 from LAT1 and LAT2. (i) It is structurally distinct from the heteromeric transporters and does not require co-expression with 4F2hc to elicit transport activity at the plasma membrane; (ii) it exhibits a narrow substrate selectivity, preferring leucine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine as substrates; (iii) it is sensitive to pretreatment with NEM; (iv) it presents a two-component kinetics (high and low affinity); (v) it functions as a facilitative diffusion transporter, i.e. moves one substrate following its concentration gradient, whereas LAT1 and LAT2 are obligatory exchangers, i.e. move their substrates in exchange for other substrates (8Pineda M.

We reasoned that other system L isoforms may exist in these tissues. In the present study, by homology to LAT3, we have cloned LAT4. LAT4-induced activity is very similar to LAT3, but LAT4 has a different tissue distribution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESComputer Analysis—The nucleotide sequence homology search was performed using basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) via an on-line connection to the National Center of Biotechnology Information. The BLASTn program was run using default parameters. Multiple amino acid sequence comparisons were performed with ClustalW via an on-line connection to the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). The prediction of transmembrane segments was performed with TopPred II. NETGLYC (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc) and NET-PHOS programs (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos) were used for N-glycosylation and phosphorylation site prediction. The phylogenetic tree was prepared from a multiple sequence alignment using Treetool (19Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J.

NcoI and XhoI restriction sites were introduced by PCR at the ATG site and directly after the stop codon, respectively. The PCR product obtained was cloned in the vector pTLN (21Estévez R. Boettger T. Stein V. Birkenhager R. Otto E. Hildebrandt F. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2001; 414: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and sequenced. A hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA) tag was added after the first methionine of mouse LAT4 using standard molecular biology techniques. We used the human LAT4 cDNA as a template for site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™; Stratagene) to replace serine 297 by alanine (LAT4SA). For HeLa cell studies, the cDNA was cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). All sequences in this study were performed in both directions with the Big Dye terminator V.3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The reactions were analyzed with an Abi Prism 377 DNA sequencer.Oocytes, Injections, and Transport Measurements—Oocyte origin, handling, and injections were as described elsewhere (22Bertran J. Werner A. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Murer H. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Defolliculated stage VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 25 ng/oocyte human LAT4, human EEG1, or human LAT3 or with 10 ng each of 4F2hc and either Xenopus LAT1 or human LAT2 cRNA. cRNA was obtained using the mMessage mMachine™ kit (Ambion).Influx rates of l-radiolabeled amino acids (Amersham Biosciences) were measured under linear conditions (10 min incubation) 2 days after cRNA injection. The uptake medium was choline chloride uptake solution (100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5) containing the desired amino acid concentration and radioactive amino acid (10 μCi/ml for 3H and 2 μCi/ml for 14C). For l-phenylalanine efflux measurements, groups of three cRNA-injected or non-injected oocytes were loaded with the labeled amino acid by incubation in 50 μm l-[3H]phenylalanine (1 μCi/100 μl) for 60 min. The loading ranged from 3,000 to 10,000 cpm/oocyte in non-injected or LAT4 injected oocytes, respectively. After loading, oocytes were washed 4 times in choline chloride uptake solution containing no amino acids. Efflux was then measured as tritium appearance in the incubation medium (500 μl) in the absence of amino acids or in the presence of phenylalanine (5 mm). To this end aliquots (100 μl) were removed from the medium at distinct times, and radioactivity was counted.Northern Blot Analysis—For human samples, a commercial membrane containing adult poly(A) RNA was used (BD Biosciences). For the mouse LAT4 expression data, 25 μg of total RNA isolated using the TrizolR reagent (Invitrogen) was loaded in each lane, separated by size in a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) by capillarity in 10× SSC (standard saline citrate 1×= 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7), and cross-linked with UV irradiation. Membranes were prehybridized in hybridization buffer (0.25 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% SDS) at 65 °C for 1-2 h and then hybridized in fresh buffer containing 25 ng/10 ml of the labeled DNA fragment used as a probe at a specific activity of 109 dpm/μg (nucleotides 1-984 for the human cDNA and 1-776 for the mouse cDNA) at 65 °C overnight. Probes were labeled with the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Washes were performed at 65 °C for 30 min, the first in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS and the second in 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS. After washing, membranes were sealed in a plastic bag and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics).RT-PCR Analysis—RNA from mouse PCT cells was isolated using the TrizolR reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was retrotranscribed to cDNA using SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was then used to amplify mouse LAT1, LAT2, LAT3, and LAT4 using specific primer pairs for each transporter. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 35 cycles. Products were visualized after size separation in a 1% agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining.In Situ Hybridization—cRNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Applied Science) by transcription of a mouse LAT4 fragment (nucleotides 1-322) or a human LAT4 fragment (nucleotides 1-345), linearized at either the 3′ (sense) or 5′ (antisense) end. Mouse tissues were embedded in paraffin after whole animal fixation with paraformaldehyde. 5-μm sections were cut on a Leica RM 2135 microtome and mounted on silanized slides (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sections were deparaffined with xylene, hydrated, and permeabilized with proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) (1 μg/ml) in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8 (37 °C, 3 min). Human kidney sections were processed in a similar manner.Hybridization was done in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 5 ng/μl labeled RNA probe at 42 °C overnight. Slides were washed in 2× SSC, treated with RNase A, and further washed to the final stringency achieved by 0.1× SSC at 37 °C. Probes were detected with an antibody to digoxigenin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and incubation with nitro blue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega). Slides were examined on an Olympus microscope, and images were captured with the Leica IM50 image manager at the Serveis Científico-Tècnics, University of Barcelona.Cell Culture—PCT cells (23Cartier N. Lacave R. Vallet V. Hagege J. Hellio R. Robine S. Pringault E. Cluzeaud F. Briand P. Kahn A. Vandewalle A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 695-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Soler M. Tornavaca O.

Subcultures were prepared by trypsinization and reseeding at high density (∼1 × 106 cells/ml). For transport polarity studies, PCT cells were seeded (4.2 × 105 cells/filter) on polycarbonate filters (12-mm diameter, 3-mm pore size; Costar). Before seeding the cells, each polycarbonate filter was pretreated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μg/ml collagen type I from rat-tail (Upstate Biotechnology). After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the collagen solution was removed. Cells were cultured in standard conditions. The formation of polarized monolayers was assessed by measuring transepithelial resistance with Millicell-Electrical resistance System (Millipore). Monolayers were considered optimal for transport polarity studies when resistance exceeded 300 ohm/cm2 after about 15 days in culture.HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed by standard calcium phosphate precipitation.Transport Measurements in Transwell Chambers—For basolateral membrane uptake experiments, apical and basal compartments were washed 3 times in preheated (37 °C) washing solution (10 mm HEPES, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4·7 H2O, 2.8 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 1 mm KH2PO4, and 137 mm N-methylglucamine, pH 7.4). Approximately, 0.5 ml of washing solution was left on the apical side of the filter during the experiment. We then added to the basal side different uptake solutions (washing solution supplemented with substrate at the desired concentration, radioactive amino acids, and inhibitors when indicated). Uptake was arrested by removing the uptake solution and washing three times with cold stop solution (washing solution at 4 °C supplemented with 10 mm substrate). Filters were then left to dry, cut, and placed in an Eppendorf tube with 200 μl of 0.1% SDS and 100 mm NaOH at 37 °C for 30 min. From these, 100 μl were used to count the radioactivity associated to the filter in a β scintillation counter, and 20 μl were used to determine the protein concentration in duplicate.Immunofluorescence on Transfected HeLa Cells—HeLa cells grown on cover slips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) for 20 min, then washed three times in PBS, incubated in PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min then in PBS containing 20 mm glycine for 10 min, and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min. Subsequently, cover slips were incubated with primary antibody (anti-HA 1:100, Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc.) diluted in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum at RT for 1 h. After washing in PBS, the cover slips were incubated with 7.5 mg/ml Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) at RT for 45 min. The cells were washed three times in PBS before mounting in Immunofluore medium (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH). The confocal images were obtained using a Leica TCS 4D laser confocal fluorescence microscope with a 63× objective at the Serveis Científico-Tècnics, University of Barcelona.Cell Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—48 h after transfection cells were harvested, and membrane proteins were extracted using PBS, 1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors. Proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred (Bio-Rad) to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS and probed with the primary antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C by overnight incubation. Three washes in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 10 min each were performed before incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat guinea pig (Jackson ImmunoResearch) that was used as the secondary antibody. After 3 washes in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 at RT for 10 min, antigen-antibody complexes were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to x-ray films. Endoglycosidase F treatment was done following the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs).RESULTSIdentification of LAT4—LAT3 has recently been identified as a new protein, previously known as POV1 (25Cole K.A. Chuaqui R.F. Katz K. Pack S. Zhuang Z. Cole C.E. Lyne J.C. Linehan W.M. Liotta L.A. Emmert-Buck M.R.

LAT3 is expressed mainly in pancreas and liver, being nearly absent from kidney, brain, or placenta. We hypothesized the existence of LAT3 homologue proteins that mediate this activity in these tissues. LAT3 shows a significant degree of identity (BLASTn) with two human cDNAs, the embryonic epithelial gene 1 (EEG1) (20Stuart R.O. Pavlova A. Beier D. Li Z. Krijanovski Y. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the predicted cDNA MGC34680, encoding LAT4. Human LAT4 cDNA (3024 bp) contains a single open reading frame encoding a putative 569-amino acid protein (GenBank™ TM/EMBL/DDBJ accession number BC027923) with a predicted molecular weight of 62.7. The first ATG codon (position 90) lies within a good consensus initiation sequence (5′-ACCATGG) (26Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar), and the open reading frame continues to the first stop codon (TAG) at base 1797. The cDNA contains a poly(A) tail of 25 adenines that starts 17 bases downstream from a typical polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at nucleotide 2977. LAT4 presents a 57% identity to LAT3 and 30% identity to EGG1 (Fig. 1a). In addition we have cloned mouse LAT4 (NM_173388). Mouse LAT4 is 91% identical to human LAT4. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that LAT3, LAT4, and EEG1 belong to the same family (Fig. 1b). LAT4 presents only about 10% homology to other proteins with system L transport activity (LAT1 and LAT2) or to other members of the SLC7, SLC2, and SLC22 families of transporters.The predicted topology (see under “Experimental Procedures”) of these proteins indicates 12 transmembrane domains with both the N and C termini located intracellularly. The PSORT2 program (bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/psort2.html) predicted a possible signal peptide in the N terminus, and the NETGLYC program (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc) predicted that the extracellular loop between the first two transmembrane domains contains N-glycosylation sites (asterisks in Fig. 1a) conserved in mouse LAT4. We tested whether LAT4 contains a signal peptide and whether the protein is glycosylated. To this end, we introduced an HA tag just after the first ATG (N-HA-LAT4), transfected HeLa cells, and assayed its subcellular localization by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1c). No signal was observed in non-transfected cells, whereas a clear plasma membrane staining was detected in N-HA-LAT4-transfected cells, indicating that epitope-tagged LAT4 reaches the plasma membrane and that the N-terminal part of LAT4 is not cleaved. In addition, N-HA-LAT4 was as functional as the wild-type LAT4 in amino acid uptake assays (data not shown). Next, we performed Western blot assays with transfected cells incubated or not with endoglycosidase F, which removes N-glycosylation. N-HA-LAT4 is detected as a broad band between 66 and 99 kDa. This broad mobility is indicative of glycosylation. In fact, treatment with endoglycosidase F reduces the molecular weight to ∼66 (Fig. 1d).Functional Characterization—To test the hypothesis that LAT4 is an amino acid transporter, we measured the uptake of isotopically labeled amino acids in oocytes injected with human LAT4 cRNA. An increased uptake of l-phenylalanine, l-leucine, l-isoleucine, and l-methionine was observed when compared with non-injected oocytes (Fig. 2a). Mouse LAT4 and HA-tagged mouse LAT4 also induced l-phenylalanine transport when expressed in oocytes (data not shown). LAT4-mediated l-phenylalanine transport is not chloride-, sodium-, nor pH-dependent (Fig. 2, b and c).Fig. 2Functional expression of LAT4 in X. laevis oocytes. a, oocytes were injected with LAT-4 cRNA (25 ng/oocyte). Two days after the injection, the uptake of 10 μm l-3H amino acids (L-aa) was determined for 10 min. b and c, ion dependence of the l-phenylalanine transport induced by LAT4. Oocytes injected with LAT4 cRNA or uninjected controls were incubated in 10 μm l-phenylalanine uptake solution containing 100 mm sodium chloride, choline chloride (ChCl), or sodium acetate (AcNa) for 10 min (initial velocity conditions) (b) or at a range of pH in choline chloride (c). Amino acid uptake rates (pmol/10 min/oocyte) were calculated by subtracting the uptake of the non-injected group from that of the cRNA-injected groups.

Interestingly, and similar to LAT3 (15Babu E. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K. Iribe Y. Tangtrongsup S. Jutabha P. Li Y. Ahmed N. Sakamoto S. Anzai N. Nagamori S. Endou H. J. Biol.

The low affinity component has a Km of 4694 ± 510 μm for l-phenylalanine and 3733 ± 1019 μm for l-leucine, and the high affinity component has a Km of 178 ± 29 μm for l-phenylalanine and 103 ± 62 μm for l-leucine.Fig. 3Kinetic analyses of LAT4-induced transport activity. Oocytes were injected with LAT4 cRNA. Two days after the injection the uptake of l-phenylalanine at different concentrations was measured in the absence of sodium for 10 min. The transport activity in non-injected oocytes was subtracted from that of cRNA-injected oocytes. Data (mean ± S.E.) correspond to a representative experiment with seven oocytes per group. Another four independent experiments showed similar results. The substrate concentrations used were 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 10000, 15000, and 20000 μm.

Acidic and basic amino acids did not inhibit the transport. Small neutral amino acids were poor inhibitors for LAT4, except for l-cysteine, which inhibited 45% of the entry of l-phenylalanine. In contrast, l-isoleucine, l-leucine, l-methionine, and l-valine were strong inhibitors (60-85% inhibition) of LAT4.

Proteasomes play a fundamental role in retaining cellular homeostasis. Alterations of proteasome function have been recorded in various biological phenomena including aging. We have recently shown that the decrease in proteasome activity in senescent human fibroblasts relates to the down-regulation of β-type subunits. In this study we have followed our preliminary observation by developing and further characterizing a number of different human cell lines overexpressing the β5 subunit. Stable overexpression of the β5 subunit in WI38/T and HL60 cells resulted in elevated levels of other β-type subunits and increased levels of all three proteasome activities. Immunoprecipitation experiments have shown increased levels of assembled proteasomes in stable clones. Analysis by gel filtration has revealed that the recorded higher level of proteasome assembly is directly linked to the efficient integration of “free” (not integrated) α-type subunits identified to accumulate in vector-transfected cells. In support we have also found low proteasome maturation protein levels in β5 transfectants, thus revealing an increased rate/level of proteasome assembly in these cells as opposed to vector-transfected cells. Functional studies have shown that β5-overexpressing cell lines confer enhanced survival following treatment with various oxidants. Moreover, we demonstrate that this increased rate of survival is due to higher degradation rates following oxidative stress. Finally, because oxidation is considered to be a major factor that contributes to aging and senescence, we have overexpressed the β5 subunit in primary IMR90 human fibroblasts and observed a delay of senescence by 4-5 population doublings. In summary, these data demonstrate the phenotypic effects following genetic up-regulation of the proteasome and provide insights toward a better understanding of proteasome regulation.

Protein degradation is a major intracellular function, which is responsible not only for housekeeping but also for the regulation of important cellular functions, such as homeostasis and survival. The proteasome is a major cellular non-lysosomal threonine protease. Through its catabolic functions, it is implicated in many cellular processes including removal of abnormal, misfolded, denatured, or otherwise damaged proteins as well as normal proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Coux O.

The 20S proteasome, a 700-kDa multisubunit enzyme complex, is a stack of four heptameric rings with the two outer α-type subunits rings embracing two central head-to-head oriented rings containing β-type subunits. The inside rings give rise to the central cavity of the particle, where the catalytic sites of the complex are confined. Three of the seven β-type subunits are proteolytically active in the mature 20S proteasome, namely, the β1, β2, and β5 subunits.

Our work in human embryonic fibroblast cultures undergoing replicative senescence has shown that the reduced levels of proteasomal activities during the process are accompanied by lower proteasome content and protein expression levels of some, but interestingly not all, proteasome subunits. Specifically, we have found that loss of proteasome function is due to lower levels of β-type subunits (the “rate-limiting” subunits), whereas α-type subunits are in excess as “free” subunits in senescent cells (12Chondrogianni N.

More recently, Ustrell et al. (24Ustrell V. Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. EMBO J. 2002; 13: 3516-3525Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar) have identified a novel nuclear protein, PA200, that activates the nuclear proteasome following γ-irradiation, thus indirectly involving the proteasome in DNA repair. Finally, Friguet and co-workers have described the ability of a lipid algae extract (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) to stimulate 20S proteasome peptidase activities following keratinocyte UVA and UVB irradiation. 2C.

Saunois, patent PCT Application WO 02/080876. In summary, although these preliminary observations indicate that the proteasome can be activated through other pathways than the standard 19S and 11S complexes, there is still limited knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms of such activation. Data have been emerging recently with regard to the regulation of proteasome assembly in mammals (reviewed in Ref. 25Kruger E. Kloetzel P.M. Enenkel C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Proteasome biogenesis is a precisely ordered multistep event involving the biosynthesis of all subunits, their assembly, and maturation processes. POMP (or human/mouse Ump1 or proteassemblin; Refs. 26Witt E. Zantopf D. Schmidt M. Kraft R. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Burri L.

Monaco J. Colbert R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res.

Hockendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Ump1 has been identified as an accessory protein, a short-lived chaperone, that is required and essential for correct maturation and normal proteasome assembly in yeast (29Ramos P.C. Hockendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). POMP is respectively responsible for the proteasome maturation and biogenesis of mammalian 20S proteasome; it is a constituent of a mammalian proteasome assembly intermediate that is detected only in precursor, inactive fractions (26Witt E. Zantopf D. Schmidt M. Kraft R. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and also becomes the first substrate of the mature proteasome (27Burri L. Hockendorff J. Boehm U. Klamp T. Dohmen R.J. Levy F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10348-10353Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been reported to interact with β1i, β1, β5, β6, and β7 subunits but not with α-type subunits (30Jayarapu K. Griffin T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated proteasome up-regulation by means of stably overexpressing the β5 subunit in different cell lines. We show that this overexpression leads to increased levels of assembled and functional proteasome. This regulation is linked with the efficient integration of “free” (not integrated) α-type subunits identified to accumulate in vector-transfected cells. Additionally, we clearly demonstrate that proteasome up-regulated cell lines confer enhanced survival against various oxidants. Finally, we provide evidence that overexpression of the β5 subunit delays senescence in IMR90 normal fibroblasts. Reagents and Antibodies—LLVY-AMC, LLE-NA, LSTR-AMC, and MG132 as well as primary proteasomal antibodies against α4 (XAPC7, C6; PW8120), α6 (C2; PW8100), α7 (C8; PW8110), β1 (Y, delta; PW8140), β2 (Z; PW8145), and β5 (X, MB1, ϵ; PW8895) subunits were purchased from Affiniti Research Products Ltd. Primary antibody against POMP was a generous gift from Dr. E. Kruger (26Witt E. Zantopf D. Schmidt M. Kraft R. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Primary antibody against β-actin (sc1616) and secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Oxidized proteins were detected with anti-dinitrophenol antibody from the OxyBlot™ Protein Oxidation Detection Kit (Qbiogene). Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Human embryonic fibroblasts IMR90 and WI38/T (SV40 T Ag WI38 VA 13 cell line) were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% nonessential amino acids (complete medium). HL60 cells were a kind gift of Dr. D. Rickwood and cultured at concentrations between 0.5 and 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and BASH (7.36 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, 0.454 mg/ml hypoxanthine, 4.18 mg/ml penicillin, 4.5 mg/ml streptomycin, and 4.53 μg/l vitamin B12). Cells were fed ∼16 h prior to the assay, and cell number was determined in duplicates using a Coulter Z2 counter (Coulter Corp.). Normal fibroblasts were subcultured when cells reached confluence at a split ratio of 1:2 until they entered senescence. Stable Transfections—An expression vector encoding for the full-length β5 subunit cDNA (plasmid pBJ1-neo.β5) was the generous gift of Drs. K. Tanaka and K. Rock (22Gaczynska M. Goldberg A.L.

Akioka H. Nothwang H.G. Noda C. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Science. 1994; 265: 1231-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). WI38/T cells were transfected with either empty vector or β5 plasmid by using the electroporation method. In brief, 107 cells were mixed with 50 μg of plasmid DNA (plasmid pBJ1-neo.β5 or empty vector) and electroporated at 260 V, 960 microfarads (Gene Pulser™; Bio-Rad). 2.1 × 105 IMR90 cells were transfected with either plasmid or empty vector by using the Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells (IMR90 or WI38/T cells) were split 48 h after transfection and maintained in complete medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Colonies of stable transfectants were isolated following 3-4 weeks of selection and propagated into cell lines. HL60 cells were transfected as originally described by Bildirici et al. (32Bildirici L. Smith P. Tzavelas C. Horefti E. Rickwood D. Nature. 2000; 405: 298Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In brief, 4 × 105 cells were washed twice with immunoporation washing medium (IPBiosciences) and then resuspended in immunoporation medium (Immunoporation Ltd.) containing antibody-coated Immunofect beads (IPBiosciences) in a ratio of 20 beads/cell. 0.2 μg of plasmid DNA (plasmid pBJ1-neo.β5 or empty vector) was added, and then cells were incubated in an end-over-end mixer at 40 rpm for 6 h at room temperature. Cells were separated from the beads using a magnetic separator (IPBiosciences) (32Bildirici L. Smith P. Tzavelas C. Horefti E. Rickwood D. Nature. 2000; 405: 298Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Tzavelas C. Bildirici L. Rickwood D. BioTechniques. 2004; 37 (280-281): 276-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), centrifuged, and suspended in 1 ml of complete medium. Three days after transfection, G418 was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 800 μg/ml. Stable transfectants were clonally selected by serially diluting 103 cells in 96-well dishes covered with a small layer of 1% high purity agarose (Invitrogen) containing 800 μg/ml G418. Survival Assays—104 WI38/T or 2 × 106 HL60 cells stably transfected with empty vector or β5 plasmid were seeded in 6-well plates in duplicates. Cells were then treated immediately (HL60) or allowed to recover for 24 h prior to treatment (WI38/T) with 10 or 20 μm tBHP, 100 or 300 μm H2O2, 1% or 2% EtOH or being subjected to metal catalyzed oxidation (treatment with 0.1 mm FeCl3/0.5 mm ADP in the presence of 25 mm l-ascorbic acid) for 2.5 h at 37 °C in fresh medium. Treated cultures were washed thoroughly in PBS, maintained in complete medium for 7 days, and counted. Each experiment was performed at least three times. For immunoblot detection of carbonyl groups into proteins, 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in normal medium and treated with 300 μm H2O2 for 30 min. Proteins were extracted immediately after treatment and 24 h after treatment. Immunofluorescence Antigen Staining and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope Analysis—For immunofluorescence labeling, cells grown on coverslips were washed in ice-cold PBS and subsequently fixed with 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by cell permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Immunolabeling of proteasomes was carried out using antibodies against the α7 and β5 subunits. The antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer). The secondary anti-mouse IgG/fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody and anti-rabbit IgG/TRITC-conjugated antibody were diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer. Images of the mounted coverslips were taken by using a Nikon PCM 2000 confocal laser scanning microscope. Routine procedures, applied as controls to demonstrate the specificity of the antibody used, were as follows: (a) the usage of normal serum instead of the reactive antibody, and (b) omission of the first antibody. All controls appeared free of any immunofluorescence background. Proteasome Peptidase Assays and Protein Determination—CT-L, PGPH, and T-L activities of the proteasome in crude extracts were assayed with hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptides LLVY-AMC, LLE-NA, and LSTR-AMC, respectively, for 30 min at 37 °C, as described previously (11Chondrogianni N. Petropoulos I. Franceschi C. Friguet B. Gonos E.S. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Proteasome activity was determined as the difference between the total activity of crude extracts or fractions and the remaining activity in the presence of 20 μm MG132. Assays of 26S proteasomes were carried out in 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm ATP (34Rivett A.J. Savory P.J. Djaballah H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were harvested (for IMR90 and WI38/T cell lines) or collected (for HL60 cell lines) at the indicated time points, lysed in non-reducing Laemmli buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (12% separating gel) according to standard procedures (35Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for blotting with appropriate antibodies. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence were used to detect the bound primary antibodies. Immunoblot detection of carbonyl groups into proteins was performed with OxyBlot™ Protein Oxidation Detection Kit (Qbiogene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein loading was tested by stripping each membrane and reprobing it with a β-actin antibody. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Separation of Proteasome Complexes by Gel Filtration—WI38/T and HL60 cells (vector- and β5-transfected cells) were lysed in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm ATP and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and then an equal amount of protein (1.5 mg) from empty vector or β5 subunit transfectants was fractionated by gel filtration using an Amersham Biosciences Superose 6 HR10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 5 mm ATP, and 100 mm NaCl (36Rivett A.J. Bose S. Pemberton A.J. Brooks P.B. Onion O. Shirley D. Stratford F.L.L. Forti K. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Proteasome fractions were identified by quantifying the CT-L activity in duplicate experiments. Immunoprecipitation of Proteasomes—Immunoprecipitated proteasomes were prepared as follows: cell monolayers of 80% confluent WI38/T vector- and β5-transfected cultures were washed and scraped into ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. 107 HL60 vector- and β5-transfected cells were collected accordingly. For radioactive labeled immunoprecipitation, prior to washing and scraping/collection, cells were starved in methionine-deficient medium for 1 h, followed by pulse labeling with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 4 h in methionine-deficient medium. Collected cells were diluted directly in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (lysis buffer). Cell extracts (equilibrated in lysis buffer) were then cleared by adding normal mouse serum and protein A-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Meanwhile, protein A-agarose beads equilibrated in lysis buffer were coupled with 1-2 μg of antibody against the α6 subunit for 3 h at 4 °C with constant rocking. The target antigen was then immunoprecipitated by adding the pre-cleared extracts in the pre-coupled antibody against α6 subunit-protein A. Binding reactions were performed with constant rocking at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were collected; washed four times in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm ATP, 75 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (washing buffer); and eluted from the agarose beads by boiling for 5 min in non-reducing Laemmli buffer. Controls were used to demonstrate the specificity of the observed immunoprecipitations. Following immunoprecipitation of proteasomes, the number of counts due to incorporated radioactive [35S]methionine in the immunoprecipitated proteasomes was determined using a Wallac 1409 DSA liquid scintillation counter. Nonradioactive samples were processed for one-dimensional SDS-PAGE as described. Analysis of Protein Turnover—Quantification of degradation of metabolically radiolabeled proteins in cell cultures was performed as follows: cells were starved in methionine-deficient medium for 1 h, incubated with [35S]methionine in methionine-deficient medium for 4 h at 37 °C, washed twice in PBS, and treated with oxidants (metal catalyzed oxidation and tBHP) for 30 min as described. Following treatment, cells were washed thoroughly in PBS and maintained in normal medium for the indicated time points up to 72 h. The degradation of metabolically labeled proteins was quantified by adding an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid on 1 ml of culture supernatant for 30 min on ice. Scintillation counting of the acid-soluble counts in the supernatant was performed using a Wallac 1409 DSA liquid scintillation counter after centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. Statistical Analysis and Densitometry—Statistical calculations and graphs were performed with Microsoft Excel software. Data were analyzed by single-factor analysis of variance, and p value was used to determine the level of significance (p < 0.05). All values were reported as mean (the average of three independent experiments) ± S.E., unless otherwise indicated. Densitometric analysis was performed with Gel Analyzer Version 1.0. Overexpression of the β5 Catalytic Subunit in WI38/T and HL60 Cells Leads to Increased Proteasomal Activities and Increased Protein Expression Levels of Proteasome Subunits—We aimed to reveal changes of the overall proteasome status and function in WI38/T and HL60 β5-transfected cells. Several stable WI38/T and HL60 clones were selected and propagated into cell lines. These cell lines exhibited similar growth rates and morphological characteristics as compared with the parental cell lines, even after several months of cultivation. Two representative cell lines, WI38/T/β5.8 and HL60/β5.3, were chosen for additional studies. As shown in Fig. 1, all three major proteasomal activities (CT-L, PGPH, and T-L) were found to be significantly increased in both WI38/T and HL60 clones (p < 0.05) as compared with their control counterparts. The activities were increased from 1.3- to 2.1-fold, with the CT-L and PGPH activities being the most affected. Transfection with vector alone (pBJ1-neo) had no effect on proteasome activities. Next we examined whether there is a quantitative difference in proteasome content in β5 transfectants. A detailed immunoblot analysis of several representative 20S proteasomal subunits was performed.

https://openalex.org/W2065778432,"In certain brain regions, extracellular zinc concentrations can rise precipitously as intense neuronal activity releases large amounts of zinc from the nerve terminals. Although zinc release has been suggested to play a pathological role, its precise physiological effect is poorly understood. Here, we report that exposure to micromolar quantities of zinc for only a few minutes robustly and specifically activated tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptors, most likely TrkB, in cultured cortical neurons. We further found that Trk activation by zinc is extracellularly mediated by activation of metalloproteinases, which release pro-BDNF from cells and convert pro-BDNF to mature BDNF. These results suggest that activity-dependent release of extracellular zinc leads to metalloproteinase activation, which plays a critically important role in Trk receptor activation at zinc-containing synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1997259637,"Prions typically accumulate in nervous and lymphoid tissues. Because proinflammatory cytokines and immune cells are required for lymphoid prion replication, we tested whether inflammatory conditions affect prion pathogenesis. We administered prions to mice with five inflammatory diseases of the kidney, pancreas, or liver. In all cases, chronic lymphocytic inflammation enabled prion accumulation in otherwise prion-free organs. Inflammatory foci consistently correlated with lymphotoxin up-regulation and ectopic induction of FDC-M1 + cells expressing the normal cellular prion protein PrP C . By contrast, inflamed organs of mice lacking lymphotoxin-α or its receptor did not accumulate the abnormal isoform PrP Sc , nor did they display infectivity upon prion inoculation. By expanding the tissue distribution of prions, chronic inflammatory conditions may act as modifiers of natural and iatrogenic prion transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2050753692,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is a key cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in many organs, whereas interleukin (IL)-6 plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation. Recent reports demonstrate interaction between the two cytokines in disease states. We have assessed the effect of IL-6 on TGF-β1 signaling and defined the mechanism by which this occurred. Stimulation of Smad-responsive promoter (SBE)4-Lux activity by TGF-β1 was significantly greater in the presence of IL-6 than that induced by TGF-β1 alone. Augmented TGF-β1 signaling following the addition of IL-6 appeared to be mediated through binding to the cognate IL-6 receptor, the presence of which was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Stat-specific signaling. TGF-β1 receptors internalize by both caveolin-1 (Cav-1) lipid raft and early endosome antigen 1 (EEA-1) non-lipid raft pathways, with non-lipid raft-associated internalization increasing TGF-β1 signaling. Affinity labeling of TGF-β1 receptors demonstrated that IL-6 stimulation resulted in increased partitioning of TGF-β receptors to the non-lipid raft fraction. There was no change in expression of Cav-1; however, following IL-6 stimulation, co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated decreased association of IL-6 receptor with Cav-1. Increased TGF-β1-dependent Smad signaling by IL-6 was significantly attenuated by inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and augmented by depletion of membrane cholesterol. These results indicate that IL-6 increased trafficking of TGF-β1 receptors to non-lipid raft-associated pools results in augmented TGF-β1 Smad signaling.

It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis in both experimental and human disease (1.Border W.A. Okuda S. Languino L.R. Sporn M.B. Ruoslahti E.

Understanding the mechanisms that regulate TGF-β1-dependent responses is therefore an important goal. TGF-β receptors reside in both lipid raft and non-raft membrane domains (8.Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Alteration in the membrane compartmentalization of TGF-β receptors between these membrane domains has recently been identified as a mechanism that regulates TGF-β1 signaling (8.Di Guglielmo G.M.

Interleukin (IL)-6 is a multifunctional cytokine produced by a variety of cells during infection, trauma, and immunological challenge and is known to play a central role in the regulation of host defense and inflammation (10.Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dysregulation of IL-6 activity or of its signaling cascade has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, breast carcinoma, hepatic cirrhosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Dysregulated TGF-β1 signaling has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (11.Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in this context, a recent report has highlighted cross-talk between TGF-β and IL-6 in intestinal epithelial cells, with TGF-β playing a role in the negative regulation of IL-6 signaling (12.Walia B. Wang L. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2130-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the kidney, IL-6 is not expressed in the healthy proximal tubular epithelial cell. It has, however, been reported that expression of IL-6 is up-regulated in various forms of renal diseases and that IL-6 expression may be associated with glomerular and tubular injury (13.Horii Y.

These studies suggest a potential role for IL-6 in modulating renal tubulo-interstitial injury, although the functional significance of altered IL-6 in proximal tubular epithelial cells is not clear. The aim of the present study was to examine the potential interaction between IL-6 and TGF-β1 signaling in proximal tubular cells. Our results demonstrate enhanced response to TGF-β1 in the presence of IL-6. This effect was associated with activation of the IL-6 cognate receptor, decreased partitioning of TGF-β receptors to lipid raft-rich membrane fractions, and a marked reduction of TGF-β receptor turnover. Both increased IL-6 and TGF-β1 may be associated with renal injury, and TGF-β1 action is implicated in progressive renal interstitial fibrosis. These results suggest a synergistic effect of the two factors that may lead to an enhanced pro-fibrotic response within the kidney, driven by proximal tubular cell activation. Reagents—All tissue culture plastics were obtained from BD Biosciences. Reporter Lysis Buffer and Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System were purchased from Promega (Southampton, United Kingdom). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was bought from Roche Applied Science. [α-32P]deoxynucleoside triphosphate and 125I-TGF-β1 were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Other reagents and sources were as follows: R-phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, R-phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse IgG monoclonal antibody, and mouse anti-human caveolin-1 antibody, BD Biosciences; recombinant IL-6 and recombinant human TGF-β1, R&D Systems Europe Ltd.

(Calne United Kingdom). Cell Culture—HK-2 cells (human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells immortalized by transduction with human papilloma virus 16 E6/E7 genes; Ref. 16.Ryan M.J. Johnson G.

Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Fresh growth medium was added to the cells every 3–4 days until the cells reached confluence. Cells were grown to confluence and serum-deprived for 48 h prior to experimental manipulation. In all experiments, cells were stimulated with recombinant TGF-β1 and/or IL-6 under serum-free conditions. In all aspects of cell biology that we have studied previously, HK-2 cells respond in an identical fashion to primary cultures of human proximal tubular cells (17.Fraser D.J. Wakefield L. Phillips A.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18.Janssen U. Thomas G. Glant T. Phillips A.O.

Pathol. 2001; 159: 1905-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). HK-2 cells are therefore a good model from which general conclusions can be drawn in terms of proximal tubular cell biology. Transient Transfection—The Smad-responsive promoter (SBE)4-Lux (21.Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Aristidis Moustakas (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). For transfection of the reporter construct, 1.3 × 104 cells/well were seeded onto a 24-well plate (this density of cells produced a 70% confluence monolayer the following day). The next day, cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of the Smad-responsive promoter-luciferase construct using the mixed lipofection reagent FuGENE 6 at a ratio of 0.6 μl of FuGENE 6 to 0.2 μg of DNA in serum-free and insulin-free medium. Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection with a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid. 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with either TGF-β1 or the combination of TGF-β1 and IL-6. Following lysis of the cells in Reporter Lysis Buffer, luciferase content was quantified by glow-type luminescence assay (Bright-Glo), and β-galactosidase activity was determined by commercial colorimetric assay (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Flow Cytometry—Cell surface expression of IL-6 receptor was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. Following detachment of HK-2 cell monolayers with trypsin/EDTA, the cells were incubated with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences; 1:40 dilution) or mouse anti-human IgG antibody (BD Biosciences; 1:40 dilution) as a control at saturating concentrations in fluorescence-activated cell-sorting buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich), 15 mm sodium azide (Fisher Chemicals), and 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 7.35) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes in fluorescence-activated cell-sorting buffer, the data were collected using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur and analyzed using CellQuest Pro™ software. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting/Western Analysis— Briefly confluent monolayers were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), scraped, and rinsed into 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min, cell pellets were extracted in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.01% NaN3, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 30 min, and then the supernatant (Triton-soluble components including membrane and cytosolic fraction) was transferred to a separate tube and kept at –70 °C until use. Immunoprecipitation was performed by standard methodologies. Briefly, cell protein samples (200 μg) were pre-cleared with 25 μl of packed protein A-cross-linked 4% beaded agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min), and the supernatant was collected. Primary antibody (2 μg/ml) was added to the cleared supernatant and incubated at 4 °C with constant mixing overnight. The immune complex was captured by the addition of packed protein A-agarose beads (50 μl) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100); 30 μl of sample buffer was then added prior to boiling for 5 min. Separation of the beads was achieved by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant was removed. Specificity of immunoprecipitation was confirmed by negative control reactions performed with either no primary antibody or IgG control. Subsequently, samples were subjected to immunoblot/Western analysis. Briefly, equal amounts of sample were prepared in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 60 mm Tris, and 0.05% (v/v) mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min prior to loading onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Electrophoresis was carried out under reducing conditions according to the procedure of Laemmli (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat powdered milk for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat powdered milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline-Tween) overnight at 4 °C. The blots were subsequently washed in Tris-buffered saline-Tween and then incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Andrews and Faller (23.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1.25 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded high-affinity sis-inducible element (hSIE) oligonucleotide corresponding to a consensus Stat-binding element, 5′-CGAGTGCATTTCCCGTAAATCTTGTCTACA-3′, in a 20-μl binding reaction buffer and 1 μg of poly(dI)/(dC) (Sigma-Aldrich). Complexes were resolved on nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels, and separated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. In supershift experiments, 20 μg/ml rabbit anti-human Stat1 or Stat3 antibody (Autogen Bioclear) was added and incubated for 20 min before addition of radiolabeled probe. Affinity Labeling of TGF-β1 Receptors and Assessment of Receptor Turnover—HK-2 cells were incubated with 250 pm125I-TGF-β1at37 °C for 1 h, and receptors were cross-linked to ligand with disuccinimidyl suberateas (Pierce) as described previously (24.Massague J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that receptor cross-linking itself has no effect on receptor internalization (24.Massague J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To assess endogenous receptor turnover, following affinity labeling and cross-linking, cells were incubated in serum-free medium at 37 °C for up to 10 h. At each time point, cells were lysed and processed for SDS-PAGE, and endogenous receptors were visualized by autoradiography. Detergent-free Purification of Lipid Raft-rich Membrane Fraction— HK-2 cells were grown to near confluence in 100-mm2 dishes and affinity-labeled as described above. After two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, two confluent dishes were scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0. Homogenization was carried out with the use of 10 strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer, followed by three 10-s bursts of a tissue homogenizer (Powergen 125; Fisher Scientific), followed by three 20-s bursts of an ultrasonic disintegrator (Soniprep 150; Fisher Scientific) to disrupt cellular membranes (25.Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The homogenates were adjusted to 45% sucrose by addition of 2 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MBS (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid-buffered saline, 25 mm 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.5, and 0.15 m NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient (4 ml of 35% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose, both prepared in MBS) was formed above and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in an SW40 TI rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light-scattering band was observed at the 3–35% sucrose interface. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the tubes, and a portion of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A 330-kDa band (125I-TGF-β·receptor complex) was detectable on autoradiography, and this was quantified by densitometry (Chemi Doc; Bio Rad). Data are expressed as percentage of the total 125I-TGF-β·receptor complex for that experiment in each fraction. This method does not allow comparative measurement of receptor expression under different experimental conditions but rather allows for the relative amount of receptor expressed in the lipid raft and non-raft fractions to be expressed as a percentage of the total receptor expressed in each individual experiment. IL-6 Enhances TGF-β1 (Smad-dependent) Signaling—Activation of the Smad signaling pathway was examined using the (SBE)4-Lux reporter, which contains four repeats of the CAGACA sequence identified as a Smad-binding element. Stimulation of HK-2 cells transiently transfected with TGF-β1 led to a significant increase in luciferase activity of the reporter construct as described previously (26.Ito T. Williams J.D. Fraser D.J. Phillips A.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 1979-1988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Addition of IL-6 (0–100 ng/ml) alone did not increase the signal above control values. In contrast, addition of IL-6 in the presence of TGF-β1 led to a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity that was significantly greater than that induced by TGF-β1 alone (Fig. 1). This effect of IL-6 was statistically significant at IL-6 doses of ≥10 ng/ml. HK-2 Cells Express Functional IL-6 Cognate Receptor—Although expression of gp130 is found in almost all cell types, cellular distribution of IL-6 cognate receptor is more limited, with studies to date documenting that IL-6 cognate receptor expression is confined to hepatocytes and leukocyte subpopulations. Enhanced TGF-β1-dependent Smad signaling seen following addition of IL-6 suggests that this is the result of binding of IL-6 directly to its cognate receptor and the resulting dimerization of gp130. Flow cytometry was used to confirm the expression of IL-6 cognate receptor on the cell surface of HK-2 cells (Fig. 2A). Functional integrity of the IL-6 signaling pathway was examined by gel shift assays performed with nuclear proteins and a Stat site-specific consensus probe (Fig. 2B). Stat activation was seen following addition of IL-6 (Fig. 2B). We verified activation of both Stat1 and Stat3 following addition of IL-6 alone to HK-2 cells by supershift assay. Incorporation of an antibody to either Stat1 or Stat3 interfered with the formation of the probe·protein complexes because band intensities were reduced with inclusion of antibody, and an additional retarded band was seen in the presence of the Stat3 antibody (Fig. 2C). Smad Protein Expression and Association—Previous studies have demonstrated cooperative binding of the Stat and Smad protein family members (27.Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) and also demonstrated that TGF-β1 activity may be modulated by Stat-dependent regulation of the inhibitory Smad protein Smad7 (28.Pitts R.L. Wang S. Jones E.A. Symes A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19966-19973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The association of Stat proteins with either Smad2 or Smad3 was examined by immunoprecipitation of either Stat1 or Stat3 and Western analysis of the Smad proteins (Fig. 3). Using this approach, we could demonstrate that Stat1 associates with both Smad2 and Smad3 but that this association is not affected by the presence of IL-6 or TGF-β1. Similarly, Stat3 also associates with Smad2 and Smad3, but this is not modulated by either IL-6 or TGF-β1. It is also unlikely in our system that regulation of TGF-β1 signaling is mediated by alterations in the expression of Smad proteins because stimulation of HK-2 cells with IL-6 and/or TGF-β1 did not alter intracellular receptor-regulated Smad expression (Smad2 and Smad3) or expression of the inhibitory Smad (I-Smad) Smad7 (data not shown). TGF-β1 Receptor Compartmentalization—Previous studies have demonstrated co-localization of TGF-β receptors into both caveolin, cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane domains called lipid rafts (29.Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar) and EEA-1-containing compartments (8.Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 9.Ito T. Williams J.D. Fraser D.J. Phillips A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25326-25332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that altered TGF-β1 function may be associated with trafficking of receptors between these two pools (9.Ito T. Williams J.D. Fraser D.J. Phillips A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25326-25332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To examine alterations in receptor partitioning, endogenous TGF-β receptors on HK-2 cells were affinity-labeled using 125I-TGF-β1. Subsequently, rafts were fractionated by sucrose density centrifugation (30.McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3601-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Following the addition of 125I-TGF-β1 (250 pm), receptors were found in both the raft and non-raft fractions, as we demonstrated previously (Fig. 4A). Scanning densitometry of the results of three separate experiments confirmed that following the addition of 125I-TGF-β1, 38% of the total TGF-β receptor partitioned into the non-raft fractions (Fig. 4B). Addition of 25I-TGF-β1 in the presence of IL-6 led to a significant increase in TGF-β receptor detected in the non-raft fraction. Under these conditions, 62% of total TGF-β receptor partitioned into the raft fractions (mean of n = 3, p = 0.02). The sterol-binding antibiotic nystatin specifically interacts with cholesterol to sequester it in the membrane, thereby effectively reducing the ability of cholesterol to interact with and exert its effects on other membrane components (31.Bolard J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 257-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 32.Holz R.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 235: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Disruption of cholesterol by pre-treatment of cells with 50 μg/ml nystatin (29.Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 1 h led to an increase of TGF-β receptor partitioning into the non-raft fraction (Fig. 4A). The increase in trafficking of TGF-β receptor into the non-lipid raft membrane fraction was associated with a further increase in TGF-β1-dependent Smad signaling following the addition of TGF-β1 together with IL-6 (Fig. 5A). The effect of nystatin was dependent on cholesterol sequestration because it was prevented by addition of cholesterol (25 μg/ml) together with nystatin to cells at 37 °C for 1 h prior to addition of TGF-β1 together with IL-6 (Fig. 5A). Next we examined the effect of inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by K+ depletion, which prevents clathrin lattice assembly and has been shown to inhibit endosome-dependent TGF-β1 signaling (8.Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Activation of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway following addition of TGF-β or TGF-β1 in combination with IL-6 was assessed by using the (SBE)4-Lux reporter (Fig. 5B). The augmentation of TGF-β1-dependent Smad signaling by IL-6 was significantly attenuated when carried out in minimal, K+-depleted medium (Fig. 5B). Cellular cholesterol disruption has been previously demonstrated to trigger shedding of membrane proteins (33.Matthews V. Schuster B. Schutze S. Bussmeyer I. Ludwig A. Hundhausen C. Sadowski T. Saftig P. Hartmann D. Kallen K.J. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38829-38839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In our experimental system, addition of 50 μg/ml nystatin at 37 °C for 1 h to confluent monolayers of HK-2 cells did not induce shedding of either TGF-β type I receptor as assessed by Western analysis of cell culture supernatant or IL-6 as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). Growth factor signaling may be modulated by alteration of caveolin-1 expression, which is likely to influence trafficking of receptors between lipid and non-lipid membrane pools (34.Fujita Y. Maruyama S. Kogo H. Matsuo S. Fujimoto T. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 1794-1804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Total caveolin-1 expression as assessed by Western analysis was unaltered following stimulation with either TGF-β1 or TGF-β1 + IL-6 (Fig. 6). In contrast, following stimulation with TGF-β1 in the presence of IL-6, there was a decrease in the association of Cav-1 with the TGF-β receptor compared with addition of TGF-β1 alone, as assessed by immunoprecipitation of TGF-β receptor type I and immunoblot analysis for Cav-1 (Fig. 6). To evaluate the importance of the IL-6-dependent trafficking of TGF-β receptors between the lipid raft and non-raft-associated membrane fractions on receptor turnover, we followed cell surface receptors affinity-labeled with 125I-TGF-β1 (Fig. 7). In cells, addition of 125I-TGF-β1 (250 pm) alone demonstrated rapid decay of the receptor. In contrast, addition of 125I-TGF-β1 together with IL-6 stabilized the receptors. The observation that stabilization of the receptor complex was related to trafficking to the non-raft membrane fractions was further supported by the observation that cholesterol sequestration by the addition of nystatin also led to prolongation of receptor complex half-life. Our interest in the regulation of TGF-β1 function in the kidney stems from the overwhelming evidence that implicates this pro-fibrotic factor in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis (1.Border W.A. Okuda S. Languino L.R. Sporn M.B. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 2.Border W.A. Noble N.A. Yamamoto T. Tomooka S. Kagami S.

https://openalex.org/W1999657364,"The passage of leukocytes out of the blood circulation and into tissues is necessary for the normal inflammatory response, but it also occurs inappropriately in many pathological situations. This process is limited by the barrier presented by the junctions between adjacent endothelial cells that line blood vessels. Here we show that activation of the Rap1 GTPase in endothelial cells accelerated de novo assembly of endothelial cell-cell junctions and increased the barrier function of endothelial monolayers. In contrast, depressing Rap1 activity by expressing Rap1GAP led to disassembly of these junctions and increased their permeability. We also demonstrate that endogenous Rap1 was rapidly activated at early stages of junctional assembly, confirming the involvement of Rap1 during junctional assembly. Intriguingly, elevating Rap1 activity selectively within endothelial cells decreased leukocyte transendothelial migration, whereas inhibiting Rap1 activity by expression of Rap1GAP increased leukocyte transendothelial migration, providing physiological relevance to our hypothesis that Rap1 augments barrier function of inter-endothelial cell junctions. Furthermore, these results suggest that Rap1 may be a novel therapeutic target for clinical conditions in which an inappropriate inflammatory response leads to disease.

Furthermore, these results suggest that Rap1 may be a novel therapeutic target for clinical conditions in which an inappropriate inflammatory response leads to disease. The movement of molecules and cells out of the blood circulation and into tissues is governed by both the permeability properties of the endothelial cells lining blood vessels and the junctions between them (1Vestweber D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, during inflammation and edema, the permeability of endothelial junctions is increased, allowing passage of leukocytes and fluid, respectively. Many factors affect vascular permeability, and generally this occurs by regulating endothelial cell junctions (2Dejana E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The regulation of cell junctions is clearly important during the process of leukocyte transendothelial migration because this barrier must first be selectively opened to allow passage of the migrating leukocyte, followed by re-sealing. In general, permeability properties of the junctional barrier parallel the ability of leukocytes to complete transendothelial migration (3Dejana E. Spagnuolo R. Bazzoni G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is thought that leukocyte binding to endothelial cell ligands prior to and during transendothelial migration leads to downstream signaling events within the endothelial cell, which are required for the appropriate regulation of junctional disassembly and reassembly following leukocyte transmigration (4Edens H.A. Parkos C.A. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2000; 41: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Signaling molecules such as the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1 have been implicated in this junctional assembly, disassembly, and maintenance (5Wojciak-Stothard B. Ridley A.J. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). More recently, work on another small GTPase, Rap1, has provided several lines of evidence suggesting a similar role for Rap1 in junctional regulation. Rap1 binds to the junctional protein AF-6/afadin (6Boettner B. Govek E.E. Cross J. Van Aelst L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9064-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and Rap1 GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HBMEC, human brain microvascular endothelial cell; HUVEC, human umbilical cord endothelial cell; TER, transendothelial electrical resistance; GFP, green fluorescent protein; 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate. and guanine nucleotide exchange factors are also recruited to tight junctions (7Su L.

Inoue E. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); furthermore, GFP-Rap1 expressed in epithelial cells co-localizes with E-cadherin at cell junctions (9Hogan C. Serpente N. Cogram P. Hosking C.R. Bialucha C.U. Feller S.M. Braga V.M. Birchmeier W. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6690-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data place Rap1 and its regulatory proteins in the right location to exert an effect on cell junctions. During Drosophila development, the positioning of adherens junctions between epithelial cells is disrupted if Rap1 is absent (10Knox A.L. Brown N.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, an activator of Rap1, DOCK4, induces formation of adherens junctions when transfected into an osteosarcoma cell line that normally lacks junctions (11Yajnik V. Paulding C. Sordella R. McClatchey A.I. Saito M. Wahrer D.C. Reynolds P. Bell D.W. Lake R. van den Heuvel S. Settleman J. Haber D.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It is also known that elevated cAMP enhances the barrier function of endothelial cells (5Wojciak-Stothard B. Ridley A.J. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The mechanism has been interpreted as due to the activation of protein kinase A and its inhibition of myosin-generated tension on the junctions between endothelial cells (12Moy A.B. Bodmer J.E. Blackwell K. Shasby S. Shasby D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L1024-L1029PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are additional effects of cAMP on vascular permeability beyond the inhibition of cellular contractility (12Moy A.B. Bodmer J.E. Blackwell K. Shasby S. Shasby D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L1024-L1029PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of a novel cAMP analog, 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP (13Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), has provided a tool to study cAMP-responsive pathways that are independent of protein kinase A; this analog cannot bind to protein kinase A, but it specifically binds to and activates the cAMP-responsive Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Epac (13Enserink J.M.

In this study, we ask whether endothelial junctional integrity (and therefore leukocyte transmigration) is affected by endothelial Rap1 activity. Cell Culture—HUVECs and primary monocytes were obtained from Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ) and cultured as described previously (15Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). HBMECs isolated from brain cortex were obtained from Applied Cell Biology Research Institute (Kirkland, WA) and cultured with the recommended media. The HL-60 promyelocytic cell line was obtained from the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Tissue Culture Facility and grown in Optimem plus 5% fetal bovine serum. Differentiation to a neutrophil-like lineage was achieved by adding 1.3% Me2SO for 3–5 days (16Hauert A.B. Martinelli S. Marone C. Niggli V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 838-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Immunofluorescence—GFP-Rap was transiently transfected into HUVECs using Amaxa Nucleofector Technology™ (Amaxa, Koeln, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, cells were stimulated with 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP for 10 min prior to fixation and co-staining. HUVECs cultured on Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated coverslips were fixed and permeabilized as described elsewhere (17Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (Sigma), monoclonal anti-PECAM clone 9G11 (R&D Systems), monoclonal anti-VE-cadherin clone BV6 (Chemicon), and monoclonal anti-ZO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Secondary antibodies used were Alexa 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were viewed with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Digital images were obtained with a MicroMAX 5-MHz charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments), utilizing Metamorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp). Calcium Switch Experiments—For junctional assembly, HUVEC monolayers were switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% fetal bovine serum containing 4 mm EGTA for 30 min to disrupt Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion. EGTA was washed out by rinsing, and synchronous junctional reassembly was stimulated by re-addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.8 mm CaCl2 for the indicated lengths of time. For experiments monitoring junctional disassembly, EGTA-containing medium was added for various times. 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP was obtained from Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany) and used at a concentration of 50 or 250 μm (Fig. 5 only) to activate Rap1. TER Measurements—Endothelial cells were plated at confluent density (3 × 105 cells/cm2) on 12-mm-diameter, 0.4-μm-pore size Transwell filters and cultured for 48 h, with media replaced daily. TER was measured using an Endohm-12 Transwell chamber connected to an EVOM voltohmmeter according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mannitol Flux Experiments—The flux of [3H]mannitol was measured in the apical to basolateral direction with confluent HUVEC monolayers grown on Transwell filters as described for TER measurements. Cells were allowed to equilibrate in media containing 1 mm cold mannitol prior to adding 4 μCi/ml [3H]mannitol to the apical chamber. After 30 min, a sample was removed from both the apical (upper) and basolateral (lower) compartment and then read in a liquid scintillation counter. The ratio of 3H counts in the lower compartment divided by the counts in the upper compartment was plotted to represent paracellular permeability. Adenoviral Infection—Recombinant adenoviruses engineered for expression of GFP and Rap1GAP were constructed by subcloning into the Adtrack-CMV vector (a gift of Robert Weinberg, Johns Hopkins University Medical Center) and then recombined with pAdEasy-1 in BJ5183 Escherichia coli (Stratagene.) The resulting DNA was transfected into HEK 293 cells with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and then the viruses were serially amplified and purified using Adeno-X™ Virus Purification Kits (BD Biosciences). HUVECs were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 3 h at 37 °C. Medium containing unabsorbed virus was then removed, and cells were cultured for 24 h in EGM-2. Infection efficiencies ranged from ∼75% to 100%, as determined by immunofluorescence. Rap1 Activity Assays—We performed Rap1 activity assays as described previously (18Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. HUVECs were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium vanadate. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with 50 μg of GST-RalGDS-RBD (provided by Dr. Leslie Parise, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) immobilized on glutathione beads to pull out active Rap1. The amount of active Rap1 and total Rap1 (reserved total cell lysate) was determined by Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-Rap1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that recognizes both Rap1A and Rap1B, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon). Where indicated, HUVECs were incubated with 1 unit/ml thrombin (Sigma) for 30 min in EGM-2. As a positive control for Rap activation, HUVECs were pre-treated with 50 μm 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP for 10 min. Quantification of Rap1 activity was performed by densitometric analysis of Western blots using ImageJ software. The relative amount of active Rap1 was calculated by dividing the amount of active Rap1 by the total amount from cell lysates. Leukocyte Transendothelial Migration Experiments—Quantitative transendothelial migration experiments were performed using HUVECs plated at confluent density (7.5 × 105 cells/cm2) on Transwell filter inserts (6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size). After 2 days, cells were activated with 5 ng/ml interleukin-1β overnight (R&D Systems). Where indicated, HUVECs were pre-treated with 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP for 15 min, and then it was removed by washing so that it was absent during the incubation with leukocytes. Differentiated HL-60 cells were added to the top well (1 × 106 cells) and allowed to transmigrate for 30 min, after which time the medium from the bottom well was collected, and transmigrated cells were counted using a hemacytometer. For video microscopy, HUVECs plated on glass-bottomed MatTek plates (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) were activated with tumor necrosis factor α (30 ng/ml) for 4 h. Primary monocytes were added to the HUVEC monolayer for 10 min to allow adhesion, and then non-adherent cells were washed away with fresh media. Cells were incubated in an environmentally controlled chamber at 37 °C with 10% CO2. Transmigration was monitored by phase video microscopy (Olympus 1X81) at ×20 magnification. Images were collected every 15 s for 15 min with a Hamamatsu C4880 charge-coupled device camera driven by Metamorph imaging software. The subcellular localization of Rap1 has been described variously as perinuclear (19Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), endosomal (20Bivona T.G. Wiener H.H. Ahearn I.M. Silletti J. Chiu V.K. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), plasma membrane (21Balduini A. Pecci A. Lova P. Arezzi N. Marseglia C. Bellora F. Perotti C. Balduini C. Balduini C.L. Torti M. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), or even nuclear (22Mitra R.S. Zhang Z. Henson B.S. Kurnit D.M. Carey T.E. D'Silva N.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6243-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), depending on cell type and culture conditions. In epithelial cells, recent work has demonstrated that Rap1 can be found at sites of cell-cell contact (9Hogan C. Serpente N. Cogram P. Hosking C.R. Bialucha C.U. Feller S.M. Braga V.M. Birchmeier W. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6690-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We examined the localization of Rap1 in endothelial cells by expressing GFP-Rap1 in HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 1, GFP-Rap1 is concentrated at the cell periphery, co-localizing with the adherens junction protein β-catenin, confirming that Rap1 is present at cell junctions in endothelia as it is in epithelia (9Hogan C. Serpente N. Cogram P. Hosking C.R. Bialucha C.U. Feller S.M. Braga V.M. Birchmeier W. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6690-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 23Cullere X. Shaw S.K. Andersson L. Hirahashi J. Luscinskas F.W. Mayadas T.N. Blood. 2005; 105: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To study the role Rap1 plays in junctional regulation in endothelial cells, we took advantage of a newly developed drug to specifically activate Rap1. 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP binds to and activates the Rap1 exchange factors Epac1 and Epac2 but does not activate other cAMP-responsive pathways involving protein kinase A and other downstream pathways, e.g. Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (13Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). We first determined whether our endothelial cell system was responsive to this compound by treating HUVEC monolayers with 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP and found a robust increase in the amount of active Rap1 compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2). In addition, no effect was seen on the activity of the Rho-family GTPases RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 in HUVECs with this treatment (data not shown). Because this compound gave us a specific means to manipulate Rap1 activity in endothelial cells, we looked at the assembly of intercellular junctions when Rap1 is thus activated by using the calcium switch experimental paradigm. This system is based on the observation that both adherens junctions and tight junctions are disrupted when cells are switched to medium containing EGTA to chelate extracellular calcium (24Cereijido M. Robbins E.S. Dolan W.J. Rotunno C.A. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 853-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 25Volberg T. Geiger B. Kartenbeck J. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), due to the loss of calcium-dependent cadherin-mediated adhesion. Subsequent washout of EGTA and restoration of physiological levels of calcium result in the synchronous de novo assembly of both junction types. HUVEC monolayers were subjected to EGTA treatment, followed by washout and readdition of calcium-containing media with or without 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP for 30 min. β-Catenin is more quickly recruited to sites of cell contact in the presence of 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP compared with HUVECs recovering in the absence of 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP (Fig. 3). This suggests that Rap1 activity enhances endothelial cell junctional assembly. To confirm this, we used another measure of junctional integrity, TER. When cultured in the presence of the Rap1-activating compound for various times, HUVEC monolayers demonstrate a slight but statistically significant increase (5–10%) in TER compared with untreated monolayers (data not shown). The low basal TER of HUVECs may make it difficult to see junction enhancing effects of Rap1 activation. Therefore, we also used HBMECs, which make up the more electrically impermeable blood-brain barrier (26Crone C. Olesen S.P. Brain Res. 1982; 241: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). When we performed this TER experiment using HBMECs, we observed a clear increase in TER (∼40% increase) when cells were treated with 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP (Fig. 4A). These experiments demonstrate that activating Rap1 not only enhances the assembly of cell junctions (Fig. 3) but also promotes a more electrically impermeable monolayer (Fig. 4A). To confirm the TER result, we also utilized mannitol flux assays as a second means to measure paracellular permeability of HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 4B, monolayers treated with the Rap-activating compound have decreased permeability to mannitol, further confirming that endothelial barrier function is enhanced when Rap1 is activated. What happens in the converse situation, when Rap1 activity is inhibited? We inhibited Rap1 activity in endothelial cells by utilizing an adenovirus expression system to express Rap1GAP. Rap1GAP exhibits specific GAP activity toward Rap1, but not toward other related GTPases such as Rap2, Ras, and the Rab family (27Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We repeated the mannitol flux permeability assay on HUVECs expressing either GFP or Rap1GAP, treating them with or without 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP (Fig. 4C). Activating Rap1 with 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP in GFP-expressing HUVECs significantly reduced permeability to mannitol, as was observed in uninfected HUVECs (Fig. 4B). However, expression of Rap1GAP to inhibit Rap1 activity enhanced the monolayer permeability to mannitol, and this could not be reversed by co-treatment with 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP (Fig. 4C). Because Rap1 activity seemed to exert positive effects on junctional assembly, we hypothesized that junctions would be resistant to disassembly under conditions of high Rap1 activity. Because the endothelial barrier is composed of both adherens junctions and tight junctions, we treated HUVECs for 1, 15, or 30 min with EGTA in the presence or absence of 250 μm 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP and then stained for β-catenin (Fig. 5A) and the tight junction protein ZO-1 (data not shown). After 1 min of EGTA treatment, HUVECs without 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP already exhibit disrupted β-catenin and ZO-1 localization and loss of cell adhesion, whereas HUVECs treated with 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP to activate Rap1 retained a significant degree of junctional integrity. This resistance to disassembly when Rap1 is activated was also observed after 15 and 30 min of EGTA treatment relative to controls. We also utilized thrombin treatment for various time points as a more physiological means to disrupt endothelial cell junctions. Fig. 5B demonstrates that 30 min of thrombin treatment (5-, 15-, and 60-min treatments; data not shown) induces junctional disassembly (loss of continuous β-catenin membrane staining; ZO-1, data not shown) in untreated cells (minus 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP). However, when Rap1 is specifically activated by 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP co-treatment, there is a resistance to junctional disassembly similar to that observed with the calcium switch in Fig. 5A. In certain cell types, particularly platelets, thrombin induces robust activation of Rap1 (18Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). We compared Rap1 activity in HUVECs that were untreated or treated with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 30 min (as in Fig. 5B) and/or 50 μm 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP. The representative blot in Fig. 5C shows that in HUVECs, Rap1 is not activated by thrombin under these conditions. Quantification of blots from three independent experiments confirmed this result (Fig. 5C, graph). The preceding experiments reveal that in endothelial cells, increasing Rap1 activity promotes junctional assembly and barrier function. How is the localization of junctional proteins affected when Rap1 activity is inhibited by expression of Rap1GAP during junctional assembly induced by a calcium switch? We first looked at the effect on β-catenin localization in untreated HUVEC monolayers expressing GFP alone or coexpressing Rap1GAP and GFP as a marker for infected cells. Expression of Rap1GAP but not GFP alone significantly disrupted the junctional localization of β-catenin in the monolayer (Fig. 6A). The typical continuous plasma membrane localization of other endothelial cell junction proteins such as VE-cadherin and ZO-1 (Fig. 6B), as well as PECAM and α-catenin (data not shown), was also impaired when Rap1GAP but not GFP alone was expressed. When we subjected these same cells to a calcium switch (Fig. 6C), the monolayer of GFP-expressing cells completely reassembled its cell junctions within 1 h of recovery, whereas the monolayer composed of Rap1GAP-expressing cells did not. The Rap1GAP-expressing cells remained more rounded and often exhibited delayed or absent recruitment of β-catenin to nascent cell junctions. Note the cells in the center of the field (Fig. 6C, asterisk) that are not expressing Rap1GAP; these cells do form β-catenin-positive cell junctions after 1 h. Collectively, these experiments indicate that Rap1 activity is involved in the formation and maintenance of both adherens junctions and tight junctions in endothelial cells and furthermore, that these processes are impaired when Rap1 activation is inhibited. The previous experiments utilize an artificial means of stimulating Rap1 activity by treatment with the Rap-activating compound 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP. We wanted to know whether activation of endogenous Rap really occurs in the cell during dynamic junctional rearrangements. To this end, we performed Rap1 activity assays (18Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) on HUVECs that were subjected to a calcium switch to induce synchronous junctional reassembly for various lengths of time. As shown in Fig. 7, there is an increase in Rap1 activity within 1–5 min of EGTA washout. Therefore, endogenous Rap1 is, in fact, rapidly activated at the early stages of junctional assembly in endothelial cells. Dynamic modulation of endothelial cell-cell junctions is a requirement for the physiological process of leukocyte transmigration. We performed quantitative transmigration assays using differentiated HL-60 cells as a model leukocyte-like cell line. HUVECs grown on Transwell filter inserts were pre-treated with 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP or media alone for 15 min, which was then washed out before the addition of the HL-60 cells to the apical side of the monolayer. Rap1 activity remained elevated in HUVECs for at least an hour after washout of 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP (data not shown), so transmigration was allowed to proceed for 30 min to stay within that time frame. Fewer HL-60 cells (∼60%) were able to migrate across an endothelial monolayer that was pre-treated with the Rap-activating compound than across an untreated monolayer (Fig. 8A). We confirmed this result using primary monocytes by analysis of video microscopy (see the supplemental data), scoring individual monocytes on the basis of whether they were adherent to the apical surface of the HUVECs yet stayed rounded up, whether they flattened and moved around on the apical surface, or whether they completed diapedesis. Fig. 8B shows that whereas 40% of the counted monocytes completed transmigration across the untreated monolayer, only 12% were able to cross the monolayer that was pre-treated with 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP. The inhibition of transmigration was not due to an effect on the ability of the monocytes to adhere and migrate across the surface of the monolayer because the number of monocytes that were scored as being flattened and migratory under these conditions was not decreased. In fact, analysis of the video indicates a greater number of monocytes migrating around on the surface of 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP-treated HUVECs, and often these cells seem to use membrane protrusions to probe at the intercellular regions between adjacent HUVECs. Finally, to directly confirm that Rap1 plays a role in the inhibition of leukocyte transendothelial migration, we used our adenovirus expression system to express either GFP alone or Rap1GAP in HUVECs and then performed Transwell transmigration assays. Expression of Rap1GAP to inhibit Rap1 activity in HUVECs significantly increased leukocyte transendothelial migration by almost 2-fold (Fig. 8C). Together, these experiments show that Rap1 enhancement of endothelial cell junction integrity has implications for leukocyte transendothelial migration. The results of this study reveal that the small G protein Rap1 plays a key role in the regulation of endothelial cell junctions and that the activation of Rap1 enhances endothelial cell barrier function. Activating Rap1 with 8CPT-2′OMe-cAMP exerts a positive effect on endothelial cell junctions, as determined by the recruitment of junction-specific proteins to sites of cell contact, by an increase in endothelial cell TER with corresponding decrease in paracellular permeability of mannitol, and by the observation that HUVECs become more resistant to junctional disruption when Rap1 is activated. Conversely, inhibiting Rap1 activity by expression of Rap1GAP induces widespread loss of cell-cell adhesion, disruption of both adherens junction and tight junction protein components, and decreased endothelial barrier function (TER, mannitol permeability). We also show that activation of endogenous Rap1 occurs during junctional remodeling, with a rapid increase in activity during very early stages of junctional assembly. Collectively, these data are consistent with the existence of two synergistic mechanisms of endothelial barrier enhancement involving cAMP: the previously described protein kinase A-dependent inhibition of myosin-generated tension on the junctions (28Moy A.B.

The mechanisms to achieve successful ER Ca2+ refilling are multiple and built on a concerted action of processes that provide a suitable reservoir for Ca2+ sequestration into the ER. Despite mitochondria having been found to play an essential role in the maintenance of capacitative Ca2+ entry by buffering subplasmalemmal Ca2+, their contribution to ER Ca2+ refilling was not subjected to detailed analysis so far. Thus, this study was designed to elucidate the involvement of mitochondria in Ca2+ store refilling during and after cell stimulation. ER Ca2+ refilling was found to be accomplished even during continuous inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-triggered ER Ca2+ release by an agonist. Basically, ER Ca2+ refilling depended on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ as the source and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) activity. Interestingly, in the presence of an IP3-generating agonist, ER Ca2+ refilling was prevented by the inhibition of trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux by CGP 37157 (7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one) that precludes the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger as well as by mitochondrial depolarization using a mixture of oligomycin and antimycin A. In contrast, after the removal of the agonist, ER refilling was found to be largely independent of trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux. Under these conditions, ER Ca2+ refilling took place even without an associated Ca2+ elevation in the deeper cytosol, thus, indicating that superficial ER domains mimic mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering and efficiently sequester subplasmalemmal Ca2+ and consequently facilitate capacitative Ca2+ entry. Hence, these data point to different contribution of mitochondria in the process of ER Ca2+ refilling based on the presence or absence of IP3, which represents the turning point for the dependence or autonomy of ER Ca2+ refilling from trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux.

This elevation in [Ca2+]cyto is subsequently maintained by adjusting the activity of Ca2+-permeable ion channels, pumps, exchangers, and buffer systems (for review see Refs. 1.Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar and 2.Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

To ensure that, even under repetitive stimulations a suitable intracellular Ca2+ release is possible refilling of the main intracellular Ca2+ store, the ER has to be accomplished either while balancing high levels of [Ca2+]cyto during cell stimulation or at least during the decay of cell stimulation. The mechanisms to achieve successful ER Ca2+ refilling are multiple and built on a concerted action of many processes that provide a suitable reservoir for Ca2+ sequestration via the ER Ca2+ pumps (SERCAs). Because elevated cytosolic Ca2+ is also substrate for Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms such as the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases or the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCXpm), Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane takes place in order to preclude a life-threatening loss of cellular Ca2+.

Sci. 2003; 18: 252-256PubMed Google Scholar) of the CCE in many cell types. Notably, the intriguing aptitude of mitochondria to effectively impound subplasmalemmal Ca2+ (i.e. mitochondrial Ca2+-buffering function) was found to be pivotal for the maintenance of the CCE pathway as they prevent Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the CCE channel(s) (15.Hoth M.

Hence, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake goes along with vectorial Ca2+ release via mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCXmito) toward the ER and the cytosol that becomes visible by ER Ca2+ refilling and the elevation in [Ca2+]cyto, respectively (19.Malli R.

However, it is not clear to what extent the transfer of entering Ca2+ across the mitochondria accounts for ER Ca2+ refilling and under which conditions trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux is prerequisite for intracellular Ca2+ store-refilling processes. In addition, the kinetics of ER Ca2+ refilling during cell stimulation, the impact of IP3, and how mitochondria participate to the process of ER Ca2+ refilling need to be investigated in more detail. Thus, we monitored changes in the free Ca2+ concentration in the cytoplasm, the mitochondrial matrix, and within the lumen of the ER ([Ca2+]er) upon cell stimulation and correlated the Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol and these organelles during Ca2+ release and refilling processes in single cells of the human umbilical vein endothelial cell-derived cell line EA.hy926 (25.Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Materials—Cell culture chemicals were from Invitrogen, and fetal calf serum was obtained from PAA Laboratories (Linz, Austria). Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes Europe (Leiden, Netherlands). CGP 37157 was purchased from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Northpoint, Avonmouth, Bristol, United Kingdom). Histamine, BHQ, EGTA, oligomycin, and antimycin A were from Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna, Austria). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England BioLabs (Frankfurt, Germany), and the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit was from Qiagen. All of the other chemicals were from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Cell Culture—The human umbilical vein endothelial cell line, EA.hy926 passage ≥45, was used for this study. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% HAT (5 mm hypoxanthine, 20 μm aminopterin, 0.8 mm thymidine). For experiments, cells were grown on glass coverslips (24 or 30 mm). Plasmids and Transfection—For transfection, an improved version of the YC4-ER (26.Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M.

Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and RP-mt (29.Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) in pcDNA 3 (Invitrogen) was used. Cells (∼80% confluency) were transiently transfected with 1.5–3 μg of purified plasmid DNA using TransFast™ transfection reagent (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Between 24 and 36 h after transfection, cells were used for the experiments. To monitor [Ca2+]mito, an EA.hy926 cell line that stably expresses RP-mt was also used, which provided virtually identical results to those obtained in cells transiently transfected with RP-mt. Solutions—Dye loading was performed with a loading buffer solution containing 2 mm CaCl2, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 2.6 mm NaHCO3, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm d-glucose, 0.1% vitamins, 0.2% essential amino acids, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% fungizone, pH adjusted to 7.4, with NaOH. The Ca2+ containing experimental buffer was composed of (in mm) 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose, and 10 Hepes acid, pH adjusted to 7.4, with NaOH. In experiments where a Ca2+-free solution was applied to the cells, Ca2+-free experimental buffer containing 1 mm EGTA was used. Imaging Device—Our setup for monitoring cytosolic and organelle Ca2+ signaling was described previously (24.Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of the Ca2+ measurements were performed at room temperature on a Nikon inverted microscope (Eclipse 300 TE, Nikon, Vienna, Austria) equipped with an epifluorescence system (150 W XBO, Optiquip, Highland Mills, NY) using the Plan Fluor ×40 oil immersion objective from Nikon. Excitation filters were changed with a Ludl filter-wheel device (Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorne, NY). Fluorescence was monitored with a cooled CCD camera (–30 °C; Quantix KAF 1400G2, Roper Scientific, Acton, MA). All of the devices were controlled by the MetaFluor® 4.0 software (Universal Imaging, Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany). The glass coverslips were mounted into an experimental chamber, and cells were perfused with experimental buffer at a rate of ∼1.5 ml/min. The perfusion system allowed fast buffer exchange from seven reservoirs. Cytoslic Ca2+ Measurements—Changes in [Ca2+]cyto were monitored using the Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2 (24.Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded for 45 min at room temperature in the dark in loading buffer containing 2 μm Fura-2/AM. Prior experiments, cells were washed twice with loading buffer and equilibrated for an additional 30 min in the same buffer in the dark. Cells were illuminated alternatively at 340 ± 15 and 380 ± 15 nm (340HT15 and 380HT15; Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT), and emission was monitored at 510 nm (510WB40, Omega Optical). [Ca2+]cyto was expressed as (F340/F380)/F0, where F0 was calculated for each single cell according to the ratio F340/F380 collected at the beginning of each experiment. Measurement of Free Mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]mito)—EA.hy926 cells expressing RP-mt were used to follow [Ca2+]mito as described previously (19.Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Zoratti C. Mayer M.

Notably, RP-mt was demonstrated to be a reliable Ca2+ sensor when excited at 410–440 nm, whereas the fluorescence of the permutated yellow fluorescent protein reflects mainly changes in the H+ concentration (30.Frieden M.

Therefore, in contrast to our previous work (19.Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Zoratti C. Mayer M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44769-44779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), in this study, RP-mt was only excited at 433 nm (433DF15, Omega Optical) and emission was collected at 535 nm (535AF26, Omega Optical). Thus, [Ca2+]mito was expressed as 1 – F430/F0 as previously shown (30.Frieden M. James D. Castelbou C. Danckaert A. Martinou J.C. Demaurex N. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was used to monitor the free Ca2+ concentration within the ER lumen. This Ca2+ sensor was excited at 440 ± 21 nm (440AF21, Omega Optical), and emission was collected simultaneously at 535 and 480 nm with one given camera using an optical beam splitter (535 and 480 nm, Dual-View MicroImager™, Optical Insights, Visitron Systems) as described previously (19.Malli R.

To correct the decay in the F535/F480 ratio during the experiments, which was probably due to photobleaching or photochromism of vYC4-ER, the changes of the ER Ca2+ concentration were expressed as (F535/F480)/F0. Statistics—Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe's post hoc F test were used for evaluation of the statistical significance. p < 0.05 was defined to be significant. ER Ca2+ Refilling Is Only Moderately Affected by IP3—As published recently (19.Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Zoratti C. Mayer M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44769-44779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the removal of extracellular Ca2+ during stimulation with histamine accelerated the rate of ER Ca2+ depletion in endothelial cells, whereas Ca2+ re-addition yielded a rapid Ca2+ refilling of the ER (Fig. 1). Notably, the kinetics of ER Ca2+ refilling upon the addition of extracellular Ca2+ was similar in the presence and absence of the IP3-generating autacoid. However, under conditions where histamine was washed out prior to Ca2+ re-addition, the ER Ca2+ content was completely restored to initial values, whereas in the presence of histamine, the ER refilled up to the level prior to the removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1). These data indicate that, in endothelial cells, a strong and efficient machinery exists that ensures ER Ca2+ refilling even under conditions of continuous intracellular Ca2+ release. As the ER Ca2+ refilling critically depends on Ca2+ influx, which is maintained by mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering (15.Hoth M. Button D.C. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10607-10612Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16.Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17.Gilabert J.A. Bakowski D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44769-44779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the question on the impact of mitochondrial function for the ER Ca2+ refilling was assessed. Inhibition of NCXmito Yields Ca2+ Accumulation in the Mitochondria and Spoils Their Capacity to Sequester Entering Ca2+ Independently of the Presence or Absence of an Agonist— The impact of Ca2+ influx on mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics was investigated by the removal and subsequent re-addition of extracellular Ca2+ during and after cell stimulation with histamine. Upon stimulation with histamine (100 μm), [Ca2+]mito elevated transiently despite cytosolic Ca2+ levels remaining elevated (Fig. 2A, both panels). Subsequent removal of extracellular Ca2+ accelerated the decrease of mitochondrial free Ca2+ until the initial value of basal [Ca2+]mito was reached (Fig. 2A, both panels). In the presence of histamine, the re-addition of Ca2+ yielded a fast and instant rise in [Ca2+]mito (Fig. 2A, left panel), whereas in the absence of histamine, mitochondrial Ca2+ elevation upon Ca2+ re-addition developed at a slower pace (Fig. 2A, right panel). To investigate the impact of the major Ca2+ export pathway from mitochondria (the NCXmito), CGP 37157, a specific inhibitor of NCXmito (31.Cox D.A. Conforti L. Sperelakis N. Matlib M.A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 32.Cox D.A. Matlib M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 938-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used. CGP 37157 (20 μm) had no effect on [Ca2+]mito under basal conditions. In contrast, upon cell stimulation, NCXmito inhibition lead to a long-lasting elevation of [Ca2+]mito that could be reduced neither by the removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2A, both panels) nor by agonist washout (Fig. 2A, right panel). In the presence of CGP 37157, the re-addition of Ca2+ had no further effect on [Ca2+]mito independently of the agonist (Fig. 2A, both panels), indicating that the capacity of mitochondria to sequester Ca2+ has been saturated under these conditions. This is in line with our previous report (19.Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Zoratti C. Mayer M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44769-44779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) where we described that CGP 37157 prevented Ca2+-inhibitable capacitative Ca2+ entry due to the lack of subplasmalemmal Ca2+ buffering by mitochondria. Thus, during cell stimulation, the inhibition of NCXmito resulted in the accumulation of Ca2+ in the mitochondria that is not reversible either by the removal of extracellular Ca2+ or by the washout of the agonist. Mitochondria Differentially Contribute to Cytosolic Ca2+ Elevation upon CCE Activity in the Presence and Absence of an Agonist—To elucidate whether or not the presence of an agonist modulates the impact of mitochondria on cytosolic Ca2+ elevation upon Ca2+ entry, similar time course protocols as described above were conducted while [Ca2+]cyto was monitored. Cell stimulation with histamine in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ caused a rapid and stable increase of [Ca2+]cyto that was immediately reduced upon the removal of extracellular Ca2+ (data not shown). In the presence of histamine, subsequent re-addition of extracellular Ca2+ rapidly and permanently enhanced [Ca2+]cyto (Fig. 2B, left panel). However, cytosolic Ca2+ elevation upon Ca2+ re-addition after histamine washout was fast but transient (Fig. 2B, right panel). Thus, in the presence of histamine, Ca2+ entry yielded a similar profile of Ca2+ elevation in the cytosol and the mitochondria, whereas in the absence of the agonist, the response differed between both compartments. Remarkably, the importance of trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux for cytosolic Ca2+ elevation also depended on the presence of histamine. Notably, inhibition of NCXmito with CGP 37157 reduced the cytosolic Ca2+ elevation upon re-addition of extracellular Ca2+ in the presence of histamine by ∼40% (Fig. 2B, left panel). A detailed analysis of the Ca2+ entry kinetics in the presence of histamine revealed that CGP 37157 reduced the rate of the initial Ca2+ elevation upon Ca2+ re-addition by ∼90%, whereas a continuous cytosolic Ca2+ elevation developed slowly (Fig. 2C, left panel). However, the inhibitory effect of CGP 37157 was much more pronounced if histamine was removed prior to Ca2+ re-addition (Fig. 2B, right panel) and no subsequent slow continuous Ca2+ elevation occurred (Fig. 2C, right panel). These data indicate that, in the presence of IP3, blocking NCXmito modestly affects cytosolic Ca2+ elevation upon Ca2+ re-addition (Fig. 2D, left panel), which might be due to Ca2+ release from partially refilled ER in the presence of histamine. However, after histamine washout, trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux is required to allow cytosolic Ca2+ elevation (Fig. 2D, right panel) and, thus, under these conditions the ER does not contribute to cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. To confirm this hypothesis, SERCA activity was blocked with 15 μm BHQ during Ca2+ re-addition in the presence of histamine. In the absence of CGP 37157, SERCA inhibition slightly enhanced cytosolic Ca2+ elevation upon Ca2+ re-addition (Fig. 3). However, in the presence of the NCXmito inhibitor, cytosolic Ca2+ elevation upon Ca2+ re-addition was strongly affected by BHQ (Fig. 3). These data point to a Ca2+ cycling across the ER in the presence of IP3 and partially filled ER stores and/or to the contributory role of ER Ca2+ buffering to the regulation of plasma membrane Ca2+ entry. To approve our data with CGP 37157, identical Ca2+ readdition protocols were accomplished in the presence of 2 μm oligomycin and 10 μm antimycin A. As shown in Fig. 4A, cell treatment with the mixture of oligomycin/antimycin A reduced histamine-induced [Ca2+]mito elevation by ∼83%. Nevertheless, mitochondrial Ca2+ decreased upon the removal of extracellular Ca2+ even in the presence of oligomycin/antimycin A, indicating that Ca2+ still moved through mitochondria despite their depolarization (Fig. 4A). However, similar to the data with CGP 37157 presented above (i.e. Fig. 2B), the inhibitory effect of oligomycin/antimycin A on cytosolic Ca2+ elevation upon Ca2+ re-addition was more pronounced after histamine washout (Fig. 4, B and C). Overall, these data suggest that the presence of an IP3-generating agonist not only affects mitochondrial Ca2+ handling of entering Ca2+ but also modulates the contribution of trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux for cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. Considering such striking differences in the pathways for cytosolic Ca2+ elevation upon Ca2+ re-addition in prestimulated cells, the modus operandi to accomplish ER Ca2+ refilling in the presence and absence of IP3 were investigated. Route and Source of Ca2+ for ER Refilling Differ Depending on the Presence or Absence of an Agonist—Inhibition of NCXmito strongly reduced ER Ca2+ refilling in the presence of the agonist (Fig. 5, A, left panel, and C). In contrast, the inhibition of NCXmito in the absence of the agonist only marginally reduced ER Ca2+ refilling (Fig. 5, B, left panel, and C), despite the strong inhibition (∼83%) of the cytosolic Ca2+ signaling by CGP 37157 (Fig. 2D, right panel). In line with these findings, oligomycin/antimycin A attenuated ER Ca2+ refilling more efficiently in the presence of histamine than in its absence (Fig. 5C, right panel). These data suggest that, in the presence of IP3, trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux equally contributes to cytosolic Ca2+ elevation and ER Ca2+ refilling upon Ca2+ re-addition to prestimulated cells. However, in the absence of IP3, mitochondrial Ca2+ transit is pivotal for cytosolic Ca2+ elevation upon Ca2+ re-addition, whereas ER Ca2+ refilling primarily occurs independently from the mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling. In the absence of IP3, ER Ca2+ Refilling Is Achieved Independently from Cytosolic Ca2+ Elevation and Mitochondrial Ca2+ Homeostasis—To further investigate the mechanisms of ER refilling, in the continuous presence or absence of CGP 37157 or the mixture of oligomycin/antimycin A, ER Ca2+ was released twice by histamine in Ca2+-free solution with an intermediate refilling period in Ca2+-containing solution. In line with the data presented above, interruption of transmitochondrial Ca2+ flux by either CGP 37157 or oligomycin/antimycin A had no or little impact on the amount of Ca2+ that could be released by a second stimulation with histamine, although [Ca2+]cyto elevation upon Ca2+ re-addition was reduced by >8"
https://openalex.org/W2120409655,"Cytochrome P450 158A2 (CYP158A2) is encoded within a three-gene operon (sco1206-sco1208) in the prototypic soil bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).

A comparison of the x-ray structures of ligand-free (1.75 Å) and flaviolin-bound (1.62 Å) forms of CYP158A2 demonstrates a major conformational change upon ligand binding that closes the entry into the active site, partly due to repositioning of the F and G helices. Particularly interesting is the presence of two molecules of flaviolin in the closed active site. The flaviolin molecules form a quasi-planar three-molecule stack including the heme of CYP158A2, suggesting that oxidative C-C coupling of these phenolic molecules leads to the production of flaviolin dimers.

Cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) 1The abbreviations used are: P450 or CYP, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase; THN, 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene; CYP158A2, cytochrome P450 158A2; SRS, predicted substrate recognition sequences originally suggested in P450 sequences by Gotoh; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond coherence; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. monooxygenases constitute a complex superfamily of proteins found in all biological kingdoms from bacteria to humans and participate in the biosynthesis of physiologically important compounds as well as in detoxification of a wide variety of foreign compounds from the environment (1Nelson D.R.

Largely as a result of genome sequencing projects, >4000 genes within the P450 superfamily have been identified (drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html). Although there has been considerable progress in the expression and characterization of recombinant P450s within the last decade, the endogenous substrates of most remain unknown. For example, there are 18 CYP genes in the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (4Bentey S.D. Chater K.F. Cerdeno-Tarraga A.M. Challis G.L. Thomson N.R. James K.D. Harris D.E.

S. coelicolor produces >20 secondary metabolites including antibiotics, siderophores, lipids, and pigments (5Lamb D.C. Skaug T. Song H-L. Jackson C.J. Podust L.M. Waterman M.R. Kell D.B. Kelly D.E.

Many of these compounds are oxidized and contain hydroxyl groups, which could arise from the function of P450s associated with the biosynthetic pathways. Most P450s catalyze monooxygenase reactions in which one atom of molecular oxygen is used to hydroxylate the substrate and the other is used to produce water (6Guengerich F.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 97-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). P450s additionally catalyze a myriad of other reactions, including epoxidations, oxidative rearrangements, and oxidative coupling reactions (7Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Chloroeremomycin and balhimycin, which are members of the vancomycin family of glycopeptide antibiotics, possess a rigidified peptidyl backbone in which the aromatic residues are linked via P450-dependent biphenyl and biphenyl ether connections (12Pelzer S.

Knock-out experiments with the P450 genes oxyA, oxyB, and oxyC in Amycolatopsis orientalis demonstrated that P450s catalyze the cross-linking steps in balhimycin biosynthesis (14Bischoff D. Pelzer S.

Thus, OxyA and OxyB catalyze C-O-C coupling reactions and OxyC is involved in C-C coupling. Schlichting and associates (16Pylypenko O. Vitali F. Zerbe K. Robinson J.A. Schlichting I. J. Biol.

CYP158A2 from S. coelicolor A3(2) has also been implicated in phenol oxidative coupling (18Cortes J. Velasco J. Foster G. Blackaby A.P. Rudd B.A. Wilkinson B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), generating red-brown pigments in actinomycetes. The gene encoding this P450 (sco1207) is located in the three-gene operon sco1206-sco1208 that also contains the type III polyketide synthase 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN) synthase (19Austin M.A. Izumikawa M.

This three-gene operon is highly conserved and present in many Streptomyces species (18Cortes J. Velasco J. Foster G. Blackaby A.P. Rudd B.A. Wilkinson B. Mol.

Homodimeric type III polyketide synthases are involved in biosynthetic pathways in bacteria for the assembly of small aromatic metabolites (19Austin M.A. Izumikawa M. Bowman M.E. Udwary D.W.

Bacterial aromatic polyketides represent a large group of biologically active natural products whose potency is often dictated by tailoring enzymes such as oxygenases, methyltransferases, and glycosyltransferases. P450s are often associated with polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters where they catalyze late-stage stereospecific and regiospecific oxidations. In the S. coelicolor operon containing CYP158A2, the 5′-gene rppA (sco1206) whose stop codon overlaps the start codon of CYP158A2 (sco1207) encodes THN synthase. This type III polyketide synthase catalyzes the sequential conversion of five molecules of malonyl-CoA to THN, which then undergoes spontaneous oxidation to flaviolin (19Austin M.A. Izumikawa M.

In this study, we focused on the catalytic activity of CYP158A2 and demonstrated that CYP158A2 catalyzes the oxidative coupling of two or three THN-based flaviolin molecules involving C-C coupling. To explore the molecular basis of this catalytic reaction, we have determined the crystal structures of CYP158A2 in the absence and presence of the substrate flaviolin, which provides the molecular basis for P450-catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions. Expression and Purification of CYP158A2—The gene encoding S. coelicolor A3(2) CYP158A2, engineered with four histidine codons at the C terminus, was subcloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET17b (Novagen, Madison, WI) using the NdeI and HindIII sites (5Lamb D.C. Skaug T. Song H-L. Jackson C.J. Podust L.M. Waterman M.R. Kell D.B. Kelly D.E. Kelly S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24000-24005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli HMS174 (DE3). Transformed E. coli was grown at 37 °C in 3 liters of Terrific Broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.8. After induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and the addition of δ-aminolevulinic acid to a final concentration of 1 mm for heme synthesis, growth was allowed to continue for an additional 24 h at 24 °C and the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The soluble CYP158A2 were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) and S-Sepharose/Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. The Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column was washed with 10 bed volumes of lysis buffer and 10 bed volumes of lysis buffer with 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. The protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 80 mm imidazole). The eluted CYP158A2 was passed over a S-Sepharose/Q-Sepharose column, washed with 5 bed volumes of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 10% (v/v) glycerol), and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Individual fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated using a Microcon-30 filtration device (Millipore, New York, NY). E. coli flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase were expressed in E. coli strain HMS174 (DE3) and purified by DEAE column chromatography as described previously (23Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectral Substrate Binding Assay—Absorbance spectra were recorded using a double beam Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer. The interaction of flaviolin with CYP158A2 was examined by perturbation of the heme Soret spectrum. CYP158A2 (2.5 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (2.0 ml, pH 7.5) was divided between two tandem cuvettes. After thermal equilibration at 25 °C, a base line was established between 350 and 450 nm and sequential additions (1–5 μl) of a concentrated aqueous solution of flaviolin (1 mm dissolved in 5% (v/v) methanol in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) were added to the sample cuvette to give a final ligand concentration in the range of 0–100 μm. An equal volume of 5% (v/v) methanol in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added to the reference cuvette, and the difference spectrum was recorded after each titration. The Hill coefficient was obtained from plot of log10(ΔA387–418/[ΔAmax - ΔA387–418]) versus log10[flaviolin]. Kd values were estimated by fitting plots of ΔA387–418versus [flaviolin]. Enzyme Activity Assay—CYP158A2 (1 nmol), flavodoxin (20 nmol), and flavodoxin reductase (10 nmol) were reconstituted in 400 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and flaviolin (0.26 μmol). Flaviolin was obtained from E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS/pHIS8-THN synthase as described previously (19Austin M.A. Izumikawa M. Bowman M.E. Udwary D.W. Ferrer J.-L. Moore B.S. Noel J.P. J. Biol.

Kozikowski A.P. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 4499-4508Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Baker P.M. Bycroft B.W. Chem. Commun. (London). 1968; 2: 71-72Crossref Google Scholar). Following incubation of this mixture for 5 min on ice, the reconstituted enzyme solution was placed in a shaking bath at 37 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 5 mm and was conducted for 2 h in a 1.5-ml tube at which time the reaction was quenched with 4 μl of concentrated HCl and extracted three times with 400 μl of ethyl acetate. The extracts were dried under a stream of N2, the residues were dissolved in 50 μl of methanol, and 20 μl of extract was injected onto an HPLC/mass spectrometry system for analysis. UV detection was at 254 nm. Negative control incubations (minus CYP158A2) were carried out as above. Large-scale Incubations—For the structural identification of those products converted from flaviolin, multiple large-scale incubations of flaviolin with CYP158A2 were carried out. The reaction mixture consisted of CYP158A2 (3 nmol of CYP/ml) and flavodoxin (35 nmol/ml) and flavodoxin reductase (15 nmol/ml), flaviolin (42 μmol), 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 1 mm NADP+, and 2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a final volume of 72 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol. The incubation proceeded for 2 h, and then the reaction mixture was acidified by concentrated HCl and extracted three times into an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The solvent was removed from the combined organic extracts in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in acetonitrile and purified by HPLC on a 5-μm HyPURITY C-18 column (10 × 150 mm) eluted with a linear solvent gradient from 65% of 0.5% formic acid/0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) to 60% of 0.5% formic acid/0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) over 25 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, monitored with UV detection at 254 nm. The desired fractions were collected and dried under a stream of N2. Identification of Flaviolin Metabolites—For HPLC/mass spectrometry analysis, electrospray ionization mass spectra were obtained using a Finnigan TSQ Quantum mass spectrometer in the positive ion mode with electrospray voltage of 4.0 kV, 300 °C capillary temperature, N2 sheath gas (43 p.s.i.), and N2 auxiliary gas (25 p.s.i.). The electrospray ionization interface and mass spectrometer parameters were optimized to obtain maximum sensitivity. HPLC separations were achieved using a YMC™ ODS-AQ 2.0 × 250 mm reversed-phase octadecylsilane column with a linear solvent gradient from 90% of 0.5% formic acid/0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) to 100% of 0.5% formic acid/0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) over 20 min followed by isocratic elution with solvent B for 10 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX 500 AVANCE spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 500.13 MHz and a carbon frequency of 125.76 MHz. Samples were prepared in either Me2SO-d6 or acetone-d6. 1H and 13C chemical shifts are reported as δ values with reference to Me2SO-d6 at 2.49 and 39.5 ppm, respectively, or acetone-d6 at 2.04 and 206 ppm, respectively. All of the measurements were run at 25 °C using standard pulse sequences. Two-dimensional techniques such as 1H-1H correlated spectroscopy (COSY), 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC) were also used for structure elucidations. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals of CYP158A2 were obtained using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method in which 2 μl of a 16 mg/ml protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 m 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.0, 5 mm spermine-HCl, and 20–25% (w/v) PEG 2000 monomethyl ether. At 20 °C, plate crystals appeared within 3 weeks. The solution used as cryoprotectant for flash cooling these crystals at liquid nitrogen temperatures was the original reservoir solution supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol. The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P21 with unit cell parameters as follows: a = 59.55 Å; b = 79.2 Å; c = 87.43 Å; and β = 92.26°. Full diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). The x-ray data were processed and scaled with the HKL package program HKL2000 (26Owtinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The substrate-free structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program CNS1.1 (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

The initial model was built in program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

There were two molecules of CYP158A2 in the asymmetric unit resulting in a solvent content of 47.5%. Co-crystals of CYP158A2 and flaviolin were grown using a well solution containing 0.1 m bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and 25% (w/v) of PEG 3350 supplemented with 1 mm flaviolin. At 20 °C, rod-like crystals were obtained within 1–4 days. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell parameters of a = 54.8 Å, b = 70.74 Å, and c = 102.57 Å. The flaviolin complex structure was also solved by molecular replacement using the program CNS1.1 (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

The coordinates and associated structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1SE6 (for substrate-free) and 1T93 (for substrate-bound)). The inhibitor-bound CYP158A2 structure used as a search model for both structures presented here was produced by crystallization in the presence of 4-phenylimidazole that binds to the heme iron. This structure was refined to 1.5 Å (Protein Data Bank accession code 1S1F), and because it is not directly relevant to the CYP158A2, the function of oxidative coupling of flaviolin is not presented herein but will be published elsewhere. 2B.

The Hill coefficient was 1.6 ± 0.2, suggesting the possible presence of more than one flaviolin molecule bound to the protein. Analysis of the reaction of CYP158A2 by electrospray mass spectrometry indicated four different products from flaviolin (Fig. 2), three isomers with a mass of 410 (MH+ 411, P1 tR 15.6 min; P2 tR 16.0 min; P3 tR 17.2 min) and one product with a mass of 614 (MH+ 615, P4 tR 17.4 min). The molecular masses of 410 and 614 (Fig. 2) are those of the dimer and trimer of flaviolin, respectively. The turnover number for flaviolin oxidation was estimated to be 1.4 min-1 based on the rate of substrate consumption under the in vitro condition used here.Fig. 2Catalytic activity of CYP158A2 supported by flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase.

The singlet at δ 6.03 was assigned to H-3, and the two 2.4-Hz doublets at δ 6.94 and 6.53 were assigned to H-8 and H-6, respectively. The proton NMR spectrum 3Because only very small amounts of P1 and P2 were available, a few additional peaks coming from impurities and solvents also appeared in the NMR spectra. However, these additional peaks could be rationally excluded by analyzing their two-dimensional NMR spectra. of P1 showed two doublets and two singlets at δ 7.2 (d, J = 2.4 Hz, 1H, for H-8), 6.81 (s, 1H, for H-6′), 6.69 (d, J = 2.4 Hz, 1H, for H-6), and 6.16 (s, 1H, for H-3′) accounting for four carbon-bound hydrogen atoms, thereby suggesting that P1 is a non-symmetrical flaviolin C-C dimer (Fig. 3, A and C). Analysis of the 1H-13C HMQC and 1H-13C HMBC spectra (H-3′ → C-1′, C-2′, C-10′; H-6 → C-5, C-7, C-8, C-10; H-6′ → C-5′, C-8′, C-10′; and H-8 → C-1, C-6, C-10) established P1 as 3,8′-biflaviolin (Fig. 3E). On the other hand, P2 was clearly a symmetric structure as judged by its 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 3, B and D), which showed two doublets at δ 6.99 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H, for H-8/8′) and 6.55 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H, for H-6/6′). This structure was assigned as 3,3′-biflaviolin (Fig. 3F) (30Stipanovic R.D. Wheeler M.H. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1980; 13: 198-201Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which was further verified through the analysis of the 1H-1H COSY, 1H-13C HMQC, and 1H-13C HMBC spectra (see supplemental data). CYP158A2/Substrate-free Crystal Structure—The global features of the substrate-free structure (Fig. 4A), determined by x-ray crystallography, show a more “open” conformation with respect to many other P450 structures (32Ravichandran K.G.

Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13121-13122Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This “open state” conformation should allow the substrate access to the active site of the enzyme (34Dunn A.R. Dmochowski I.J. Bilwes A.M. Gray H.B. Crane B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12420-12425Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the case of the substrate-free structure (1.75 Å), the F/G helices are rotated out of the active site so that the cleft reflects a gap between the F helix and β-sheet 4. Additionally, because of the absence of substrate, the substrate access pocket is filled with water molecules. The water molecule coordinating the heme iron at the sixth position is present with a Fe-H2O bond distance of 2.38 Å. CYP158A2/Flaviolin Complex Crystal Structure—An examination of the general protein fold for the structure of the substrate-complex indicates that the substrate access channel closes with respect to the substrate-free structure (Fig. 4B). The root mean square difference of superposition for the Cα atoms upon binding of flaviolin to CYP158A2 as compared with the substrate-free structure is 0.93 Å (Fig. 5), which implies significant conformational change. Overall, the largest conformational changes occur in the regions Arg14-Pro22, Leu44-Trp50, and Gly70-Pro98 (SRS-1) (35Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Pro99-Ser107 and Gly162-Asp213 (SRS-2 and SRS-3), Glu231-Thr247 (SRS-4), His287-Arg295 (SRS-5), and Phe388-Gly396 (SRS-6), which represent ∼35% of the total amino acid sequence of CYP158A2. Among these regions, Arg14-Pro22, Leu44-Trp50, Gly70-Pro98, Gly162-Asp213, and Phe388-Gly396 are located on the distal surface of the protein. The most significant change occurs in the F/G region (Gly162-Asp213), and the largest movement of F/G loop residues is at Ser182 and His183 where the Cα atoms are displaced 15–16 Å when substrate is bound (Fig. 5). In the flaviolin complex, the"
https://openalex.org/W2092307522,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers in men. Each year approximately 543,000 new cases are reported worldwide, and the disease kills 200,000 (mostly older men) in developed countries. The existing treatment approaches and surgical intervention have not been able to effectively manage this dreaded cancer and, therefore, continuing efforts are ongoing to explore novel targets and strategies for the management of PCa. The activity of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is elevated in tissues and cells with a high mitotic index, including cancer cells. An increasing body of evidence suggests that the level of Plk1 expression has prognostic value for predicting outcomes in patients with some cancers. A close correlation between Plk1 expression and carcinogenesis has been documented. However, the role of Plk1 in PCa is not known. We propagated a hypothesis that Plk1 inhibition will result in elimination of human PCa cells via a mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis (1). To define the role of Plk1 in PCa, we used the technique of RNA silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA). First, using a series of human prostate carcinoma cells and normal human prostate epithelial (PrEC) cells, we assessed Plk1 levels in PCa. Immunoblot analyses clearly showed a significant expression of Plk1 in LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 human PCa cells. Interestingly, Plk1 was not detectable in normal PrEC cells. Next, we transfected the PCa cells with Plk 1 siRNA, which resulted in a significant inhibition in Plk1 protein in all PCa cells. Plk1 depletion resulted in a decrease in cell viability and induction of apoptosis in PCa cells but had no appreciable effect in normal PrEC cells. Our data also demonstrated that Plk1 siRNA transfection of PCa cells resulted in 1) a mitotic cell cycle arrest, 2) failure of cytokinesis, and 3) defects in centrosome integrity and maturation. Thus, our study suggested that 1) Plk1 plays a critical role in the process of PCa development and 2) gene therapeutic approaches aimed at Plk1 or the pharmacological inhibitors of Plk1 may be developed for the management of PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2159740399,"Recently, we discovered that Humanin (HN), a small endogenous peptide of 24 amino acids, binds to and inhibits the proapoptotic protein Bax. We show here that HN also interacts with the BH3-only Bcl-2/Bax family protein, Bid, as well as a truncated form of Bid (tBid) associated with protease-mediated activation of this proapoptotic protein. Synthetic HN peptide binds purified Bid and tBid in vitro and blocks tBid-induced release of cytochrome c and SMAC from isolated mitochondria, whereas mutant peptides that fail to bind Bid or tBid lack this activity. Moreover, HN peptide also retained protective activity on bax–/–mitochondria, indicating that HN can block tBid-induced release of apoptogenic proteins from these organelles in a Bax-independent manner. HN peptide inhibits tBid-induced oligomerization of Bax and Bak in mitochondrial membranes, as shown by experiments with chemical cross-linkers or gel filtration. Gene transfection experiments showed that HN (but not an inactive mutant of HN) also protects intact cells from apoptosis induced by overexpression of tBid. We conclude that Bid represents an additional cellular target of HN, and we propose that HN-mediated suppression of Bid contributes to the antiapoptotic activity of this endogenous peptide.

Mitochondria constitute one of the critical centers of life and death control within mammalian cells.

The six known human antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family possess all four BH domains, and most also contain a C-terminal hydrophobic span of amino acids responsible for their insertion into intracellular membranes. In contrast, proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are more diverse in their sequences, typically containing only one to three of the four conserved BH domains (2Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, two principal classes of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins have been delineated, known as “multidomain” proteins versus “BH3-only” proteins (BOPs). The multidomain proapoptotic proteins contain BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains and include Bax, Bak, and Bok, in mammals. Structural studies suggest that the multidomain proteins have essentially the same protein fold as the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (12Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N.

BOPs utilize their BH3 domains to interact with either antiapoptotic or proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Although the BH3 domains of all BOPs identified thus far are capable of binding and inhibiting antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, a few BOPs can also bind and activate proapoptotic multidomain proteins Bax and Bak. The activation of Bax and Bak is associated with their oligomerization in mitochondrial membranes, an event that results in release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria (15Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Schlesinger P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gene ablation studies in mice indicate that either bax or bak is required for apoptosis induction by BOPs, such that double knock-out mice lacking both of these genes are insensitive to BOP-induced apoptosis (16Lindsten T.

Bid is the first of the BOPs reported to bind and activate Bax and Bak directly, functioning as an agonist of these multidomain proteins. Under the normal physiological conditions, Bid is present in the cytosol of cells in an inactive state. However, upon proteolytic cleavage that removes the N-terminal ∼50 amino acids, Bid becomes active, apparently exposing its BH3 domain, promoting insertion into mitochondrial membranes, and triggering interactions with other Bcl-2/Bax family proteins (15Korsmeyer S.J.

Although sequence alignments reveal the presence only of the BH3 domain in Bid, the three-dimensional structure of Bid is highly similar to Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL (12Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N.

Humanin (HN) was originally identified as an antiapoptotic peptide encoded in a cDNA which rescued neuronal cells from apoptosis induced by presenilin mutants associated with familial Alzheimer disease, during a functional screen of a cDNA library prepared from the brain of a patient with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer disease (24Hashimoto Y.

Some reports suggest that HN is secreted from cells and binds receptors in the plasma membrane (29Niikura T. Hashimoto Y. Tajima H. Nishimoto I. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, our laboratory showed previously that HN is present within the cytosol of cells where it can bind Bax and prevent the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria, thus providing protection from death stimuli that depend on this multidomain member of the Bcl-2/Bax family (30Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In this report, we further demonstrate that HN can bind Bid as well as N-terminally truncated Bid (tBid), nullifying the proapoptotic activity of tBid. The findings thus broaden the range of HN targets within the Bcl-2/Bax family and may provide the basis for eventually exploiting this knowledge toward the goal of devising novel cytoprotective strategies. Plasmid Constructions—Plasmids encoding HN have been described previously (30Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C.

Protein Purification—The Bid, tBid, Bcl-XL, Bax, and caspase-8 proteins were produced in bacteria and purified similarly to previous reports (32Zhai D. Miao Q. Xin X. Yang F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Zhai D. Huang X. Han X. Yang F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Kuwana T. Mackey M.R.

Fluorescence Polarization Assays (FPAs)—To determine the binding affinity of HN peptides to Bid and tBid proteins, FPAs were performed according to procedures published previously (35Zhai D. Ke N. Zhang H. Ladror U. Joseph M. Eichinger A. Godzik A. Ng S.C. Reed J.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of Bid, tBid (cleaved by caspase-8), or Bcl-XL ΔTM (used as control) proteins were incubated with 20 nm FITC-conjugated synthetic purified HN peptide dissolved in water in the dark. Fluorescence polarization was measured using an Analyst TM AD Assay Detection System (LJL Biosystem, Sunnyvale, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. IC50 determinations were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Apoptosis Assays—HEK293T, HeLa, and MEF cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. For transient transfection apoptosis assays, cells (5 × 105) in 6-well plates were cotransfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 0.5 μg each of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) or pcDNA3-myc-tBid, together with various amounts of GFP-HN or pcDNA3-myc-Bcl-XL plasmids. For caspase assays, cell lysates were prepared after 20 h, normalized for protein content, and 10-μg aliquots of cell lysates were incubated with 100 μm DEVD-AFC, measuring enzyme activity by the release of AFC fluorescence. Data are reported as relative fluorescence units (RFU) of product produced/min/μg of total protein. Apoptosis was assessed by DAPI staining of cells. Briefly, at 20 h after transfection, both floating and adherent cells were collected, fixed with PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde, and stained with 0.1 mg/ml DAPI in PBS. The percentages of apoptotic cells were determined by UV-microscopy, counting GFP-positive cells having nuclear fragmentation and/or chromatin condensation. All assays were performed in triplicate. Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells were cultured with native HN or polyarginine HN at 10 μm for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with HN peptide antibody (gift from I. Nishimoto). Immune complexes were visualized with Alex Fluor 488-conjugated goat antibody to rabbit immunoglobulin G (Molecular Probes). HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of GFP, GFPC1-HN, GFP-HN(1–12), or GFP-HN(13–24). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde. Confocal fluorescence images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 instrument. Protein Interaction Assays—Synthetic HN peptide (10 μg) was incubated at 4 °C for 4 h in 200 μl of PBS together with recombinant His6-Bid, His6-tBid, or control His6-Bcl-XL ΔTM (10 μg each) and 10 μl of Ni-NTA resin. Then the resins were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS, and bound proteins were analyzed by Tris-Tricine gel electrophoresis, following by Coomassie Blue staining. Either recombinant tBid produced by cleavage with caspase-8 (100 ng) or His6-Bcl-XL ΔTM was bound to Ni-NTA resin in PBS buffer containing 1% CHAPS and 2% γ-globulins. HN peptide was preincubated with the resin for 15 min, then 100 ng of recombinant Bax was added. After an additional 4-h incubation, the resin was washed three times and then eluted with 0.5 m imidazole. The supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using tBid or Bax antibody (Santa Cruz). Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Procedures—Transfected HEK293T cells (5 × 105) were cultured with 50 μm benzoyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (ZVAD-fmk; Bachem) to prevent cell death. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 142.4 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After removing debris by centrifugation, lysates were normalized for protein content (50 μg in 400 μl) and incubated with 10 μl of anti-myc (Santa Cruz) antibody-conjugated Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times in 1 ml of lysis buffer and boiled in an equal volume of Laemmli gel loading solution before analysis of proteins by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science) or monoclonal mouse anti-myc (Santa Cruz) antibodies. Alternatively, lysates were normalized for total protein content and analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Mitochondria Purification and Protein Release Assays—Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and then washed once in HM buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm mannitol, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA), containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cell pellet was then homogenized in HM buffer by 50 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, using a B-type pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 600 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting mitochondria-containing pellet was washed twice with the HM buffer. For mitochondrial protein release assays, 10 μl of mitochondria (50 μg) was added into a final volume of 50 μl of HM buffer containing tBid or tBid preincubated with HN peptide at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was incubated further at 30 °C for 40–60 min, then mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a volume of HM buffer equal to the volume of supernatant collected. The samples were then diluted 1/4 with 5× Laemmli solution, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using cytochrome c (75981A Pharmingen) or SMAC antibodies (3Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). Chemical Cross-linking—Oligomerization of Bak was assessed by chemical cross-linking. In brief, dimethyl sulfoxide or bismaleimidohexane cross-linker (Pierce) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to mitochondria at a final concentration of 5 mm for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were quenched with 50 mm cysteine for 15 min at room temperature. Mitochondria were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using anti-Bak antibody (Upstate). Gel Filtration Chromatography—A Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with buffer containing 1% CHAPS, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. Then, 100 μl of mitochondrial lysates dissolved in 2% CHAPS (200 μg of total protein) was loaded onto the column, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using antibodies recognizing Bax (N20, Santa Cruz). Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—HEK293T cells in 100-mm plates were cotransfected with 2 μg each of plasmids encoding myc-tBid or myc-Bcl-XL with GFP-Bak in duplicate, and the cells were cultured with 50 μm ZVAD-fmk to prevent cell death. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-myc beads overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were split into five equal aliquots, and various concentrations of HN peptide were added. After 6 h of incubation, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 142.4 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) (500 μl each). Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using tBid (36Krajewska M. Mai J.K. Zapata J.M. Ashwell K.W. Schendel S.L. Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or GFP antibodies (Roche Applied Science). Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc solid phase synthesis on an ACT 350 multiple peptide synthesizer. HN, HN(13–24), HN mutant peptides, HN1, and FITC-HN were synthesized on Fmoc-Alanine Wang resin to give peptides with C-terminal carboxyl groups; only HN(13–24) and HN1 were acetylated on their N termini. HN2, HN3, HN4, and HN(1–12) were synthesized on Rink amide resin to amidate the C termini; only HN3 was acetylated. FITC was linked to the Lys4 side chain to form FITC-HN. The peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with 94% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% H2O, 2.5% 1,2-dithioethane, 1% triisopropylsilane for 2 h at room temperature; polyarginine peptides were treated for 6 h. The crude peptides were purified with a Gilson high performance liquid chromatography instrument and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass analysis with an Applied Biosystems Voyager System 6264. HN Binds to Bid—We showed previously that HN can bind Bax but not Bak and not antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and Bcl-B (30Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). While testing other Bcl-2/Bax family proteins for interactions with HN, we observed that HN binds the proapoptotic BOP, Bid. Three different methods demonstrated binding of HN to Bid, including in vitro protein interaction experiments, immunoprecipitation from cell lysates, and FPAs (Fig. 1). Interestingly, HN bound to both full-length and caspase-8-cleaved Bid. For example, we immobilized recombinant His6-Bid protein on nickel resin and then digested a portion of the immobilized protein with caspase-8. Synthetic HN was then incubated with Bid-coated beads, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. By these pull-down assays, we observed that synthetic HN peptide bound equally well to either cleaved or uncleaved Bid (Fig. 1A). Note that after caspase cleavage, the N- and C-terminal portions of cleaved Bid remain physically associated, consistent with prior reports (13Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 37Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). In contrast, His6-Bcl-XL ΔTM did not pull down HN peptide. To explore further the binding of HN to Bid and cleaved Bid, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments where HN was expressed in HEK293T cells as a GFP fusion protein, together with myc-tagged Bid (Fig. 1B), myc-tagged truncated Bid, representing the last 60–195 amino acids of the Bid protein corresponding to the C-terminal fragment produced in vivo by caspase cleavage (19Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 20Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar), or myc-Bcl-XL. HN was expressed with GFP fused to either its N or C terminus and compared with GFP control protein. As shown in Fig. 1, GFP-HN and HN-GFP associated with both Bid and tBid (Fig. 1B), whereas GFP control protein did not. Immunoblot analysis of the transfected cell lysates demonstrated production of equivalent amounts of Bid or tBid in all samples and showed that GFP was produced at levels as high or higher than HN-GFP and GFP-HN, thus excluding differences in protein expression as a trivial explanation for the results. Using the same conditions, GFP-HN and HN-GFP did not coimmunoprecipitate with Bcl-XL, confirming the specificity of these results. Finally, FPAs provided additional evidence that HN binds directly to Bid and tBid. For these experiments, FITC-conjugated HN peptide was incubated with various concentration of His6-Bid or caspase-8-cleaved Bid, and fluorescence polarization of the FITC-HN peptide was measured (Fig. 1D). Both Bid and tBid induced concentration-dependent, saturable fluorescence polarization of the FITC-HN peptide, whereas Bcl-XL did not. Binding of FITC-HN to tBid produced a sigmoidal curve, allowing estimation of the Kd for the interaction of ∼10–20 nm (Fig. 1C). HN Prevents tBid-induced Apoptosis—We tested whether HN can suppress caspase activation and apoptosis induced by overexpression of tBid in cells. For these experiments, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding tBid in combination with plasmids encoding either GFP-HN or GFP control protein, then either caspase activity was measured in cell lysates or the cells were fixed and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by DAPI staining. Expression of tBid induced caspase activation and apoptosis (Fig. 2, A and B). Cotransfecting GFP-HN plasmid resulted in concentration-dependent reductions in caspase activity and apoptosis. Comparisons with a Bcl-XL-encoding plasmid revealed similar potency compared with GFP-HN with respect to suppression of tBid-induced caspase activation (Fig. 2A). Because immunoblotting experiments confirmed that GFP-HN does not interfere with tBid expression (Fig. 1C), we conclude that HN is able to suppress tBid-induced apoptosis. Synthetic HN Peptides Containing Membrane Penetration Sequences Suppress tBid-induced Apoptosis—Alternative theories have been proposed for explaining the cytoprotective mechanism of HN, involving either an extracellular role for HN via interactions with cell surface receptors (29Niikura T. Hashimoto Y. Tajima H. Nishimoto I. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) versus an intracellular role suppressing Bcl-2/Bax family proteins (30Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two mechanisms, we compared the activity of synthetic HN peptides containing versus lacking membrane-penetrating sequences with respect to their ability to inhibit caspase activation and apoptosis induced by overexpression of tBid. We exploited the ability of polyarginines to confer membrane-penetrating properties upon peptides, comparing four different designs, including polyarginine8 at the N terminus, polyarginine8 appended to the C terminus, polyarginine6 added to the C terminus, and polyarginine4 added to both the N- and C terminus (Fig. 3A). To reduce polarity of the peptides, the N termini were acetylated, and the C termini were amidated. Based on previous studies of similar peptides, we anticipated that all four of these arginine-modified versions of HN would be membrane-permeable (38Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K.

Experiments with polyarginine peptides confirmed their ability to enter cells, as determined by confocal microscopy using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-HN antibody (Fig. 3B and not shown). In contrast, the HN peptide lacking appended arginines did not penetrate cell membranes. These synthetic peptides were added to cultures of HEK293 cells transfected with tBid-encoding plasmid, and then either caspase activity (Fig. 3C) or apopto"

We have determined the crystal structure of the conserved, intermembrane space core portion of apo-hSCO1 to 2.8 Å. It is similar to redox active proteins, including thioredoxins (Trx) and peroxiredoxins (Prx), with putative copper-binding ligands located at the same positions as the conserved catalytic residues in Trx and Prx. SCO1 does not have disulfide isomerization or peroxidase activity, but both hSCO1 and a sco1 null in yeast show extreme sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Of the six missense mutations in SCO1 and SCO2 associated with fatal mitochondrial disorders, one lies in a highly conserved exposed surface away from the copper-binding region, suggesting that this region is involved in protein-protein interactions. These data suggests that SCO functions not as a COX copper chaperone, but rather as a mitochondrial redox signaling molecule.

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cytochrome c oxidase; IMS, intermembrane space; DTT, dithiothreitol; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; Trx, thioredoxin; Prx, peroxiredoxin; FOX, ferrous oxidation in xylenol orange; ADA, N-(2-acetamido)-2-iminodiacetic acid. or complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and pumps protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane to establish a proton gradient for ATP synthesis (1Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It is composed of 3–4 polypeptides in bacteria, 10–12 in yeast, and 13 in mammals. In eukaryotes, the three largest, and most evolutionarily conserved, subunits (I, II, and III) are encoded by mitochondrial DNA and contain most of the prosthetic groups (3Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar coppers, 1 magnesium, 1 sodium, and 2 hemes); they perform the electron transfer and proton pumping functions. The other subunits, encoded by nuclear DNA, are presumably required for modulation of COX activity (2Richter O.M. Ludwig B. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 147: 47-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Additional nuclear gene products are also required for the assembly of COX (1Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), including those responsible for synthesis of heme A, transport and insertion of metal cofactors, and proper co-assembly of the mitochondrial DNA- and nuclear DNA-encoded subunits. Numerous COX assembly genes have been identified in yeast (3Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with many of these having human homologues, including COX10, COX11, COX15, COX17, COX19, LRPPRC, OXA1, PET112, SCO1, SCO2, and SURF1. The SCO family of proteins (an acronym for synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase) contains a highly conserved CXXXC motif that presumably binds copper, and therefore is hypothesized to transport copper to COX (1Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Both humans and yeast have two SCO-like genes, but they are paralogs (i.e. gene duplication occurring in the two lineages independently), not orthologs (i.e. divergence from a common ancestral gene pair) (4Papadopoulou L.C. Sue C.M. Davidson M.M. Tanji K. Nishino I. Sadlock J.E. Krishna S. Walker W. Selby J. Glerum D.M. Van Coster R. Lyon G. Scalais E. Lebel R. Kaplan P. Shanske S. De Vivo D.C. Bonilla E. Hirano M. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Human SCO1 (hSCO1) is a 301-residue polypeptide consisting of a ∼40-residue mitochondrial targeting signal at its N terminus, a ∼45-residue domain protruding into the mitochondrial matrix, a ∼20-residue domain spanning the mitochondrial inner membrane, and a C-terminal region of ∼185 residues protruding into the intermembrane space (IMS) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Materials Fig. 1). Human SCO2 (hSCO2) is 35 residues shorter than hSCO1, due mainly to a smaller matrix domain (Supplementary Materials Fig. 1). Mutations in hSCO1 cause fatal infantile hepatoencephalomyopathy (5Valnot I. Osmond S. Gigarel N. Mehaye B. Amiel J. Cormier-Daire V. Munnich A. Bonnefont J.P. Rustin P. Rötig A. Am. J. Hum.

Both disorders are associated with severe COX deficiency in affected tissues, but the reason for the “tissue specificity” in the two disorders is unknown. Remarkably, the COX deficiency in cells from patients with hSCO2 mutations (6Jaksch M. Paret C. Stucka R. Horn N. Muller-Hocker J. Horvath R. Trepesch N. Stecker G. Freisinger P. Thirion C. Muller J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28802-28809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), could be rescued by the addition of copper to the growth medium, but the mechanism by which this rescue occurred is unknown; the addition of copper to yeast lacking Sco1p, however, could not rescue COX function (12Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To understand better the role of the SCO family members in disease, we have solved the crystal structure of hSCO1, using MAD phasing. Insights gained from the structure, biochemical characterization, and results reported in the literature imply that hSCO1 is a redox active protein that participates in mitochondrial redox sensing and signaling. Protein Expression and Purification—The entire C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (i.e. the region protruding into the IMS) of hSCO2 (residues 79–266, ∼22 kDa (Supplementary Materials Fig. 1)) was isolated by PCR, inserted into pET-24D (Novagen), and expressed in BL21-DE3 cells using standard protocols. Overexpressed hSCO2 was purified to homogeneity using standard chromatographic techniques. Briefly, cell debris was removed from sonicated cells by centrifugation (150,000 × g for 30 min). The supernatant was immediately passed over a preparative scale Sepharose-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and the bound hSCO2 was washed and eluted with a gradient (100 to 500 mm NaCl). Fractions containing the protein (determined by SDS-PAGE) were concentrated to ∼4 ml and passed over a Sepharose G-75 sizing column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Fractions containing the protein were concentrated to ∼500 μl at 30 mg/ml and the buffer was exchanged for crystallization trials (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT). Purified hSCO2 protein was digested with a set of proteases and analyzed by mass spectrometry and N-terminal protein sequencing to determine domain boundaries. The N-terminal boundary starts at residue Gly102 with the same C terminus as the full-length sequence (Supplementary Materials Fig. 1). Based on this analysis, we also made a truncated hSCO1 expression construct (residues 138–301). For bacterial expression of hSCO1 in the presence of added copper, we followed the approach detailed in Nittis et al. (13Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Selenomethionyl-labeled hSCO1 protein was prepared as described elsewhere (14Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. Lemaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) and purified as described above. Crystallization—Approximately 30 mg/ml purified hSCO1 and hSCO2 proteins were subjected to hanging drop crystallization trials at 4 and 20 °C, using sparse matrix factorials (Hampton Research). Based on the initial trials, each crystallization trial was optimized further based on the level of observed protein precipitation. We obtained crystals of hSCO1 using 20–38% PEG-8000, 50–200 mm NaSCN, and 0–10% xylitol (w/v) at 4 °C overnight. Typically, the crystals grew as showers of needles or thin plates, but occasionally we obtained several large single crystals. The crystals were fragile, usually dissolving within a day of observation. Consequently, we grew the crystals 12 to 24 h prior to data collection. Typically, we could grow several crystals of 200 × 50 × 20 μm3 dimension. Data Collection and Reduction—All data were collected at NSLS-X4A at Brookhaven National Laboratory using an ASDC Quantum4R CCD detector. Despite screening a number of cryoconditions, it proved difficult to produce a uniform spot shape over the entire image. The crystal diffracted to better than 2.8 Å and a four-wavelength MAD data set was collected at 100 K using inverse beam geometry in 20° swaths. We used Denzo (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) to index and reduce the data. Initial indexing predicted a primitive tetragonal space group; in particular, two sides of the unit cell were nearly identical. However, further processing produced high Rmerge values. Thus a primitive orthorhombic space group was chosen based its Rmerge values (Table I). Each wavelength was scaled as P212121 using Scalepack (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol.

After solvent flattening in Resolve, the overall figure of merit was 0.55, and the maps were easily interpretable. Resolve was also used to build the initial trace, placing ∼65% of the residues (17Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). After several iterations of model building using the graphics package O (17Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) and CNS (18Brunger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), we built the remaining portion of the model. The structure has been submitted to the Protein Data Bank with the entry code 1WPO. Sizing Chromatography—We used sizing chromatography to establish whether hSCO1 is a monomer, dimer, or higher order oligomer (19Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellecchia G. Guercin G.H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We equilibrated a Superdex G-75 (10/20) column (Amersham Biosciences) with 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. We prepared fresh low molecular mass standards (13.7–67 kDa; Amersham Biosciences) at 2 mg/ml, and applied 25 μl of each individually to the column. hSCO1 was then applied using the same buffer and running conditions. Thioredoxin Assay—We employed the turbidimetric insulin assay introduced by Holmgren (20Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to test whether hSCO1 possesses thioredoxin activity. All solutions were prepared as described (20Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thioredoxin from Escherichia coli was overexpressed from the Trx fusion tag vector pET22b (Novagen) and was purified to homogeneity using a nickel-chelating column and gel filtration. The protein was >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations of hSCO1 and Trx were determined spectrophotometrically. A microplate reader was used to measure the A600 at 5-s intervals with mixing between each measurement. The concentration of SCO and Trx was varied over the range of 10 to 100 μg/ml. Each well of the microplate contained 80 μl of insulin, SCO (or thioredoxin), and water to bring the final volume to 98 μl. The reaction was started with 2 μl of DTT at either 1 or 10 mm. Controls contained protein and insulin without DTT, as well as insulin without protein but with DTT. Peroxidase Activity Assay—Reduction of hydrogen peroxide by hSCO1 and E. coli glutathione peroxidase (GPX; Sigma) were tested using the FOX (ferrous oxidation in xylenol orange) assay (21Nourooz-Zadeh J. Tajaddini-Sarmadi J. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 mm DTT or reduced glutathione was added to 50 mmN-(2-acetamido)-iminodiacetic acid (ADA) (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. GPX (∼0.1 μg/ml as estimated by A280 of the stock solution) was added to this solution followed by the addition of 1 mm H2O2. The reaction was carried out at room temperature. Samples (50 μl) were taken at 2, 5, 15, and 45 min and added to 950 μl of the FOX assay solution. The absorbance at 560 nm was read after a 30-min period for color development. For the hSCO1 activity assay, the same reagent concentrations were used except the concentration of hSCO1 was 160-fold greater (i.e. 16 μg/ml). Controls were carried out in the absence of enzyme. Both controls indicated non-enzymatic reduction of H2O2 and was subtracted from the GPX and hSCO1 data. Peroxide Sensitivity Assay—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type strain, W303, and isogenic COX-deficient strains were grown overnight in liquid YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose). Saturated cultures were diluted 1:1 in fresh YPD in the presence, or absence, of 6 mm H2O2 (Sigma) and grown for 2 h at 30 °C. 10-Fold serial dilutions were then spotted on solid YPD and grown for 36 h at 30 °C, after which growth was scored. Crystallization of the C-terminal “Core” of Human SCO1—We used limited proteolysis, N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrometry to produce a fragment of hSCO1 suitable for MAD crystallographic analysis. The resulting core SCO1 fragment, which runs as a monomer on a size exclusion column (data not shown), comprises nearly all of the C-terminal, IMS portion of the protein (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Materials Fig. 1), and contains the CXXXC motif as well as the other residues reported to be critical for SCO function. The crystals belong to the P212121 space group with three monomers in the asymmetric unit. The initial electron density maps could be traced without breaks despite high B factors and high solvent content (63%) (statistics in Tables I and II and final electron density shown in Supplementary Materials Fig. 2).Table IIRefinement dataRange of Bragg spacings (Å)20-2.8Rwork20.9%Rfree24.0%σ Cut-off0Number of reflections used in refinement (w/Bivoet differentiation)29,933Number of reflections used in Rfree1,463Completeness of dataTotal99.3%Last shell99.3%Number of protein atoms (3 monomers)3886Number of waters26RMS deviations from bond length0.0078Ideal stereochemistry bond angle1.29Root mean square deviation B factorsMC bond/angles1.44/2.52SC bond/angles2.27/3.55Ramachandran dihedral angles (%)aRamachandran analysis calculated with Molprobity (kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/molprobity)Favored95.5Allowed99.6a Ramachandran analysis calculated with Molprobity (kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/molprobity) Open table in a new tab The structure obtained from the selenomethionyl preparation did not contain copper, despite the faint orange color of the protein solution. When we added copper to the growth medium, the final solution of the purified protein was indeed deeper orange, as confirmed by UV-visual spectrometry. This preparation also acted as a monomer on a size exclusion column. A cursory attempt to produce crystals using the standard factorial screen failed, but this copper-supplemented preparation did crystallize in the same condition that yielded the copper-minus crystals, and a single wavelength x-ray data set was collected from these crystals. However, refinement starting from the isomorphous copper-minus hSCO1 structure and a composite omit map once again indicated that the copper was missing. Addition of H2O2 to the protein solution caused the orange color to disappear, and using a starch/iodide test, we detected low levels of peroxides in the crystallization buffer (probably oxidation products in the polyethylene glycol). Thus, oxidizing conditions in the crystallization solution may have oxidized Cu(I) to Cu(II) and dislodged the copper from hSCO1 (discussed below). Overall Structure—The overall fold of the core hSCO1 fragment (Fig. 1) is similar to that of thioredoxin (Trx) superfamily members (22Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), as predicted, despite a barely recognizable sequence similarity (<20% identity) (23Chinenov Y.V. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); this has also been shown by NMR (24Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Structure. 2003; 11: 1431-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (see below). Upon superposition of the core elements defining the Trx -fold, the conserved cysteines of the CXXXC motif found in all SCO homologs localized to a position analogous to that of the active site CXXC cysteines in Trx and other related oxidoreductases (Fig. 2). Superposition with other proteins that contain the Trx fold indicated that hSCO1 is most similar to family members of the peroxiredoxin (Prx) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) families. Besides differences in length and in the conformation of several loops, the major difference between SCO and Prx/GPX is in the nature of the active site residues (Fig. 2): whereas SCO has two cysteines, Prx has only one cysteine in the active site and GPX has a selenocysteine (both corresponding to the C-terminal Cys in the CXXXC of SCOl). The CXXXC motif itself is actually very specifically conserved as (T/S)XCPD(V/I)CP in authentic SCO proteins (Supplementary Materials Fig. 1). Active Site and SCO Loop—The CXXXC site of hSCO1 is located at the β3–α2 turn (residues 167–171) in the heart of the Trx fold, where it is in close proximity to the β4–α3 turn (residues 204–209) and the base of an extended loop between α4 and β8 (residues 242–262); the latter is absent in Trx and Trx-like family members (e.g. protein-disulfide isomerase, phosducin) (Fig. 1). Peroxiredoxin family members do have similar features (Fig. 1d), but their loops between α4 and β8 are considerably shorter (Fig. 1c). The uniquely extended loop in hSCO1 includes two antiparallel β-strands (β6 and β7) at its base, and other authentic SCO family members have similarly extended insertions with highly conserved sequences for the base segments (Supplementary Materials Fig. 1); hence, we designate this feature as the “SCO loop.” Despite being solvent exposed in all three independent molecules of the crystal, the SCO loop segments all have continuous electron density for similar backbone conformations. A number of SCO-conserved residues at the junction of the CXXXC site with the β4–α3 turn and the base of the SCO loop create an extensive hydrogen-bond network (Figs. 2 and 3b). Specifically, completely conserved Asp204 (hSCO1 numbering throughout unless indicated otherwise) makes a hydrogen bond to the guanidinium group of completely conserved Arg207 (3.2 Å) and to the hydroxyl group of completely conserved Tyr256 (2.7 Å), which is at the base of the extended loop. Arg207 is involved in stacking interactions with Tyr256 and with His168 (although His168 is not strongly conserved among species). In addition, Asp204 is succeeded by a completely conserved proline, Pro205, which limits the dihedral angles available to Asp204. The carboxyl group of completely conserved Asp208 makes several H-bonds: one to the hydroxyl group of conserved Ser/Thr167 (2.57 Å) preceding the CXXXC motif; another to the backbone amide of Ser/Thr167 (2.75 Å); and one to the hydroxyl group of conserved Ser/Thr202 (2.68 Å). Finally, completely conserved His260 from β7 is hydrogen bonded to Tyr163 (3.53 Å) from β3 preceding the CXXXC site (Fig. 3b). Recently, an NMR structure of the distant SCO relative from B. subtilis, YpmQ, was published by Balatri et al. (24Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Structure. 2003; 11: 1431-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Whereas the core of the molecule is similar to that of hSCO1 (with the exception of a misplaced C-terminal helix; see Supplementary Materials Fig. 3), there are major differences in structure at the active site and at the adjacent SCO loop compared with the hSCO1 structure presented here (Supplementary Materials Fig. 3). The NMR structure of YpmQ indicates that this region is highly flexible, whereas the crystal structure of hSCO1 indicates that it is well ordered. As noted above, this order is not because of lattice contacts. Rather, much of the discrepancy between the hSCO1 and YpmQ structures is likely because of sequence differences. Sequence similarity is low overall (30% identity) and several key positions do not have the canonical SCO residues. Specifically, the otherwise conserved CPD-(V/I)CP sequence is replaced by CETICP in YpmQ, and the shortened SCO loop of YpmQ is also missing conserved features at its base: Arg242 is replaced and Asp259 is deleted. Also, the completely conserved Arg207 and Tyr256 of hSCO1 (which stack together and hydrogen bond to Asp204) are replaced in YpmQ by Asn and Asp, respectively; in fact, Arg207 is the site of a lethal point mutation in hSCO2 (7Jaksch M. Ogilvie I. Yao J.B. Kortenhaus G. Bresser H.G. Gerbitz K.D. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Moreover, SCO-conserved Tyr163 and Gly165 are replaced in YpmQ by Asp and Ile, respectively; these changes would necessarily alter SCO-like interactions with His260. Because much of the active site region is disordered in the YpmQ structure, it is difficult for us to make functional comparisons with hSCO1. SCO1 and Copper—In the crystal structure, the position of the conserved residues Cys169, Cys173, and His260, which are implicated in Cu(I) binding at the CXXXC site by EXAFS and by mutagenesis experiments in yeast Sco1 (13Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), are in close proximity to each other in hSCO1 (Fig. 2). Based on small molecule studies (25Katz A.K. Shimoni-Livny L. Navon O. Navon N. Bock C.W. Glusker J.P. Helv. Chim. Acta. 2003; 86: 1320-1338Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the atomic configuration of the Cu(I) ligands should be trigonal planar. However, using each allowed rotamer for the imidazole-N of His260 and for the thiol-S of Cys169 and Cys173 of the CXXXC motif, we calculated minimal distances of 2.84, 3.29, and 3.71 Å, respectively, to the oxygen atom of a water molecule (with weak density) that resides in the center of these residues. These lengths are considerably greater than the expected values of 1.98 ± 0.10 Å for Cu(I)-N and 2.25 ± 0.10 Å for Cu(I)-S. Alternatively, based on an ideal Cu(I)-S distance of 2.25 Å and a perfect trigonal planar bonding arrangement, a distance of 3.9 Å between each copper ligand (i.e. S-S or N-S) would be required. Again, no combination of side chain rotamers of these cysteines produced distances within 0.2 Å of the idealized bonding distance. Backbone conformational changes in hSCO1 would be required to form a Cu(I)-binding site. The absence of Cu(I) allows the sulfhydryl groups of the CXXXC motif to make H-bonds: Cys169 makes a 3.03-Å H-bond to the backbone amide nitrogen of Cys173 and the sulfhydryl group of Cys173 makes a weak 3.54-Å H-bond to the hydroxyl group of nearly conserved Tyr216. Side chain torsional changes place the sulfur atoms of these cysteine residues in position for disulfide bond formation. There are several other nearby residues that likely affect the ability of SCO to bind copper. These include the strongly conserved Phe166, which makes van der Waals contact to Cys169, and Tyr163, which could donate an axial hydroxyl group to the putative trigonal planar Cu(I) site (Fig. 2). Finally, the region surrounding the Cu(I) site, including Val172, Leu177, Phe200, Ile257, and Ile262, is generally hydrophobic. Characterization of SCO Function—The striking similarities between hSCO1 and Trx, and especially the position of the reactive cysteines, suggested that hSCO1 might have disulfide reductase activity. However, using an insulin precipitation assay (20Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that neither hSCO1 with, or without, added copper catalyzed insulin precipitation, implying that hSCO1 lacks observable thioredoxin activity (Fig. 4a). Likewise, similarity to the Prx and GPX families suggested that SCO might have peroxidase activity. We therefore tested hSCO1 for peroxidase activity with H2O2 as the substrate and used DTT and reduced glutathione to regenerate the active site cysteines. Compared with the control experiment using glutathione peroxidase, hSCO1 shows negligible peroxidase activity toward hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4b). However, we cannot rule out peroxidase activity toward other substrates (e.g. lipid peroxides). As noted above, however, our construct of hSCO1 did prove to be highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. The effect of peroxide on the UV-visual spectral characteristics of hSCO1 that we produced in copper-supplemented medium is similar to that specific to the copper-bound state of the SCO homolog PrrC from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (26McEwan A.G. Lewin A. Davy S.L. Boetzel R. Leech A. Walker D. Wood T. Moore G.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but these features were abolished by addition of peroxides (Fig. 4c). We also tested the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of SCO by challenging both yeast sco1 and sco2 null mutants with hydrogen peroxide, and assessed the resulting colony forming potential by spot tests on rich glucose (YPD) medium. The ΔSCO1 mutant (Fig. 4b), but not the ΔSCO2 mutant (data not shown), showed extreme sensitivity to 6 mm H2O2, whereas the isogenic parental strain W303 (Table III) displayed no sensitivity to H2O2, nor did another pet mutant deleted for COX14 (Fig. 4b). Because ΔCOX14 and ΔSCO1 have similar COX-"

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). Senile plaques are composed by the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), a 40–42-amino acid peptide that originates from the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (2Mattson M.P. Nature. 2004; 430: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). There is also evidence relating the etiopathology of AD with oxidative stress induced by Aβ in the brain of AD patients (3Lovell M.A. Ehmann W.D. Butler S.M. Markesbery W.R.

Aβ increases the production of intraneuronal reactive oxygen species (ROS) and stimulates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels through metal ion reduction (7Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S.

In vitro experiments also support the observation that the neurotoxic effect of Aβ is mediated by free radical mechanisms (5Miranda S. Opazo C. Larrondo L.F. Munoz F.J. Ruiz F. Leighton F.

In addition, E2 prevents Aβ-induced cell death by activation of the α-ER (19Kim H. Bang O.Y. Jung M.W. Ha S.D. Hong H.S. Huh K. Kim S.U. Mook-Jung I. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 302: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and preserves neuronal viability and function in cortical neurons exposed to glutamate toxicity (20Sribnick E.A. Ray S.K. Nowak M.W. Li L. Banik N.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 76: 688-696Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Also, there is evidence that E2 prevents morphological neurodegenerative changes in hippocampal neurons caused by Aβ deposits (21Shah R.D. Anderson K.L. Rapoport M. Ferreira A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the other hand, neurofibrillary tangles are intracellular aggregates of paired helical filaments produced by hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (23Ferreira A. Lu Q. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a key enzyme in the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein (24Takashima A. Noguchi K. Sato K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7789-7793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased paired helical filaments were observed in transgenic mice overexpressing GSK-3β (25Lucas J.J. Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos P. Moran M.A. Hen R. Avila J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). In addition, GSK-3β accumulates in the cytoplasm of pre-tangle neurons following the pathological progression of the disease (26Pei J.J. Braak E. Braak H. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Winblad B. Cowburn R.F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1010-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cortical and hippocampal neurons challenged with Aβ, there is an activation of GSK-3β (24Takashima A.

Besides, GSK-3β is involved in the signaling of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (29Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar) and also in wingless/Wnt signaling (30Dierick H. Bejsovec A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 153-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wnt signaling is essential for development, synaptogenesis, and oncogenic processes (31Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lucas F.R. Salinas P.C.

Wnt proteins inhibit GSK-3β, disrupting a multiprotein complex comprising GSK-3β and its substrates in the Wnt signaling pathway, which, unlike other growth factors, do not require a priming phosphate (29Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling also inactivates GSK-3β via activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme (40Chen R.H. Ding W.V.

Gundimeda U. Gopalakrishna R. Pike C.J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the absence of a Wnt ligand, GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin for ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation (44Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R.

Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have studied the neuroprotective properties of vitamin C, E2, and Trolox (a hydrosoluble analogue of vitamin E) on rat hippocampal neurons challenged with Aβ and H2O2. Incubation with E2 and Trolox reduces the neuronal cell death induced by Aβ treatment, as evaluated by the MTT assay and the TUNEL assay for apoptosis. Both Trolox and E2 decreased intraneuronal ROS levels. We also found that E2 and Trolox can modulate the Wnt signaling pathway. In fact, both treatments decreased the level of the GSK-3β activity in neurons exposed to Aβ. Moreover, such treatment increased β-catenin levels and regulated the expression of Wnt ligand genes. Moreover, treatment of hippocampal neurons with E2 prevented the Aβ-induced rise in the cytoplasmic calcium levels. Similar results were observed in the presence of conditioned medium enriched with the Wnt-7a ligand. Taken together, these results established that E2 and Trolox protect neurons exposed to Aβ. The mechanism involved is apparently related to modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and regulation of the cytoplasmic calcium content of neuronal cells. Materials—Synthetic Aβ1–40 peptide corresponding to the human Aβ wild-type sequence was obtained from Chiron Corp. Inc. (Emeryville, CA) and Calbiochem. Chemicals (E2, Trolox, and vitamin C), culture media, and sera were obtained from Sigma, Roche Applied Science, Merck, and Invitrogen, and Fluo-3 AM was obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) (α-agonist of ER) and diarylpropionitrile (DPN) (β-agonist of ER) were purchased from Tocris Cookson (Ellisville, MO), and ICI 182780 (antagonist of ER) was donated by Elger Entech (Jena, Germany). Primary Rat Embryo Hippocampal Neuronal Cultures—Hippocampal neurons were isolated from 18-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the directives of the Council of the European Communities No. 86/609/CEE. Pregnant rats were killed by CO2 inhalation. Then, embryos were rendered hypothermic and decapitated. Hippocampi were aseptically dissected and trypsinized for 20 min. After centrifugation for 1 min, cells were seeded in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% horse serum into 1% poly-l-lysine-coated plates. After 120 min, medium was removed, and Neurobasal medium was added containing 1% B27 supplement from Invitrogen, plus streptomycin and penicillin. On day 3 of culture, hippocampal cells were treated with 2 μm 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine for 24 h to reduce the number of proliferating non-neuronal cells. Cultured hippocampal neurons were used for the experiments on day 6. Aggregation of Amyloid β-Peptide—Aβ fibrils were obtained by dissolving freeze-dried aliquots of Aβ1–40 in Me2SO. Peptide stock aliquots were diluted in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 100 μm Aβ. Solutions were stirred continuously (1300 rpm) at room temperature for 48 h. The quality of amyloid was verified by different criteria including turbidometry, Congo red binding, and thioflavine T spectrofluorometry (48Alvarez A. Opazo C. Alarcon R. Garrido J. Inestrosa N.C.

Aliquots of the homogenate were transferred to a denaturing buffer and resolved by Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE to quantify the concentration of Aβ contained in the fibrils. This was achieved by densitometric scanning using different Aβ concentrations as standard. Cell Viability Assay (MTT Reduction)—MTT assays were performed as described previously (50Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (41920) Google Scholar, 51Muñoz F.J. Opazo C. Gil-Gómez G. Tapia G. Fernández V. Valverde M.A. Inestrosa N.C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3081-3089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons (2 × 104 cells/100 μl/well) were assayed in B27- and phenol red-free medium. Neurons were pre-incubated for 2 h with 100 μm vitamin C, 10 μm E2, 100 μm Trolox, or medium (control). Then, 5 μm Aβ or 100 μm H2O2 was added to the wells. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, after which cell viability was measured by the MTT method. MTT reduction was determined in a Lab Systems Uniskam I spectrophotometer at 540 and 650 nm. Immunofluorescence Studies—Hippocampal neurons were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (20,000 neurons/cover) in 24-well culture plates. After 6 days in Neurobasal medium plus B27, neurons were washed and exposed to Aβ and antioxidants. Then, neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunostaining was done with polyclonal anti-NF-200 antibody (1:300; Sigma). Antibody detection was made using rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted and analyzed under a Zeiss confocal microscope. Neuronal morphology was analyzed by confocal microscopy, and the number and length of neurites were evaluated using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetic, Silver Spring, MD). Neuronal Apoptosis by TUNEL Assay—Programmed cell death was evaluated by the TUNEL method using the In Situ POD Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science). Hippocampal neurons were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (50,000 neurons/cover). After 5 days in Neurobasal medium plus B27, hippocampal neurons were washed, starved for 2 h, and treated for 6 h. Then, neurons were fixed in fresh paraformaldehyde (4%) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and staining was performed as indicated by the manufacturer. Samples were analyzed under a light microscope (Olympus BX51TF), and the percentage of apoptotic cells (brown staining) on different fields was determined using the Image-Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics), the data were subdivided into 10 intervals (from 0% to 100% apoptosis), and the frequency of each interval was calculated. Measurement of Intracellular Free Radicals—Hippocampal neurons were incubated with the fluorochrome 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate at 5 μm for 2 h. Then, wells were washed three times with Hank's solution, and neurons were pretreated for 2 h with the corresponding antioxidants in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Aβ fibrils (5 μm) were added to each well and incubated for 4 h. Cells were trypsinized, and fluorescence was monitored (excitation, 495 nm; emission, 520 nm) using a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer. Results are expressed as percentages relative to control neurons arbitrarily set at 100%. GSK-3β Activity—After 5 days in Neurobasal medium plus B27, hippocampal neurons were treated for 6 h. Then, neurons were washed twice with cold Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and lysed (25 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 30 μm Na2P2O7·10H2O, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaVO3, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μm leupeptin). To immunoprecipitate GSK-3β, samples were incubated overnight with 10 μl of rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-GSK-3β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and then 25 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added for 4 h. Immune complexes were centrifuged (425 × g, 4 °C, 1 min) and washed six times with cold immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 30 μm Na2P2O7·10H2O, 1 mm NaVO3, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μm leupeptin). Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Then, membranes were incubated with goat anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal IgG p-GSK-3β (Tyr-216) or goat polyclonal anti-phosphoserine p-GSK-3β (Ser-9) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using an anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Films were scanned, and densitometry was carried out with MATRIX software (Quantavision). The GSK-3β kinase activity assay was performed in immunoprecipitation buffer with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 62.5 μm phospho-glycogen synthase peptide-2 (GS-2; Upstate Biotechnology) as substrate. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was analyzed by two different methods. 1) Samples were adsorbed to p81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman, Pleasanton, CA) and washed three times for 15 min with 0.75% orthophosphoric acid, and then radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. 2) The reaction was stopped with protein charge buffer, and samples were resolved by Tris-glycine 16% SDS-PAGE; the gel was dried, and GSK-3β phosphorylation peptide substrate was assayed using autoradiography. Films were scanned, and densitometry was carried out with MATRIX software. Cytoplasmic β-Catenin Stabilization—After 5 days in culture, hippocampal neurons were treated for 6 h in Neurobasal medium alone. Then, neurons were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed (10 μm HEPES, 1.5 μm MgCl2, 10 μm KCl, 1 μm EDTA, 1 μm dithiothreitol, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/μl pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10% glycerol) for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged (4000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min), and supernatants were kept at 4 °C to evaluate β-catenin. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Then, membranes were incubated with a mouse anti-β-catenin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using an anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Films were scanned, and densitometry was carried out as indicated above. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—After 6 days in Neurobasal medium plus B27, hippocampal neurons were kept in Neurobasal medium for 4 h. Then, cells were lysed with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was calculated by the absorbance measurement at 260 and 280 nm (UV-150–02 Shimadzu spectrophotometer). In the RT-PCR assay, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was used for the RT reaction. The PCR was performed with 2.5 μl of RT reaction mixture (1 μl of reaction buffer, 0.5 μl of 10 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1.5 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 0.125 μl of primers at 100 μm, 1 μl of Taq polymerase, and 16.75 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water). PCR conditions were as follows: for Wnt-5a, 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles; and for Wnt-7a, 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 54 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. β-Actin was measured as a housekeeping gene, and its PCR amplification conditions were the same as those of the gene measured. RT-PCR primers for Wnt-5a, Wnt-7a, and β-actin were as follows: Wnt-5a, 5′-TGAACCTNCACAACAAYGAGGCGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAGCGGCTGTTGACCTGTAC-3′ (reverse); Wnt7a, 5′-TGAACCTNCACAACAAYGAGGCGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTTCTTGATCTTCAGGAAGCGGCTGTTGACCTGTAC-3′ (reverse); and β-actin, 5′-TCTACAATGAGCTGCGTGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TACATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAA-3′ (reverse). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel poured in Tris acetic EDTA buffer. The band intensity for Wnt-5a and Wnt-7a was measured with MATRIX software, and normalized with β-actin band intensity. Calcium Imaging and Fluorescence Measurements—Hippocampal neurons grown on glass coverslips were loaded for 30 min (37 °C) with 5 μm Fluo-3 in its AM form (Fluo-3 AM) in Krebs Ringer HEPES-glucose containing 0.02% pluronic acid. Coverslips were washed three times and left in Krebs Ringer HEPES-glucose for 10 min until cell fluorescence reached a plateau. Fluorescence was imaged with a LSM Pascal Zeiss confocal microscope as described previously (52Quintanilla R.A. Porras O. Castro J. Barros L.F. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Background was measured in parts of the field devoid of neurons and found to be not significantly different from the signal recorded in neurons depleted of dye with 100 μm digitonin. This value was subtracted from cell measurements. The fluorescence intensity variation was recorded from 20–25 neurons on average per experiment. Estimation of fluorescence intensity of Fluo-3 AM was presented as the pseudoratio (ΔF/F) indicated by the following equation: ΔF/F = (F - Fbase)/(Fbase - B), where F is the measured fluorescence intensity of the Ca2+ indicator, Fbase is the fluorescence intensity before the stimulation, and B is the background signal determined from the average of areas adjacent to the neurons (52Quintanilla R.A. Porras O. Castro J. Barros L.F. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 53Svoboda K. Denk W. Kleinfeld D. Tank D.W. Nature. 1997; 385: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Besides, from dye saturation, ΔF/F is thought to approximately reflect [Ca2+] if there is no change in dye concentration, intracellular environment, or path length (53Svoboda K. Denk W. Kleinfeld D. Tank D.W. Nature. 1997; 385: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the means ± S.E. from four independent experiments with at least 20–25 neurons per experiment. Quantification of Copper—The Cu concentration was determined by means of a graphite furnace atomic adsorption spectrophotometer (SIMMA 6100; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Calibration was performed against a standard curve prepared using dilutions of Cu standards, and the sample values were normalized to the total protein content (54Araya M. Olivares M. Pizarro F. Gonzalez M. Speisky H. Uauy R. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2003; 77: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the means ± S.E. of the values from the number of experiments indicated in the corresponding figures. Data were evaluated statistically by using Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Analysis of variance was used to compare apoptosis distribution between different populations. We evaluated the neuroprotective properties of three different antioxidant molecules: Trolox (a derivative of vitamin E), E2, and vitamin C. Hippocampal neurons challenged with Aβ were pretreated with Trolox, E2, or vitamin C (Fig. 1). After 24 h, cell viability was measured by the MTT reduction assay (Fig. 1A). As we expected, Aβ decreased cell viability (40%). This effect was partially prevented by the presence of Trolox and E2 (p < 0.05). However, vitamin C was unable to protect hippocampal neurons. This latter result is in contrast with reports that implicated vitamin C in the protection of neurons exposed to Aβ (55Yallampalli S. Micci M.A. Taglialatela G. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 251: 105-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When neurons were exposed to H2O2, results similar to those observed with Aβ were obtained (Fig. 1B). These results are in agreement with reports that implicated ROS generation in Aβ-induced neuronal death (4Smith M.A. Perry G. Richey P.L. Sayre L.M. Anderson V.E. Beal M.F. Kowall N.

https://openalex.org/W2155746231,"The aim of this study was to identify and functionally characterize cardiac subtypes during early stages of development. For this purpose, transgenic embryonic stem cells were generated using the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter driving the expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). EGFP-positive clusters of cells were first observed as early as 7 days of development, thus, even before the initiation of the contractile activity. Flow cytometry and single-cell fluorescence measurements evidenced large diversities of EGFP intensity. Patch-clamp experiments showed EGFP expression exclusively in pacemaker and atrial but not ventricular cells. The highest fluorescence intensities were detected in pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes. In accordance, multielectrode-array recordings of whole embryoid bodies confirmed that the pacemaker center coincided with strongly EGFP-positive areas. The cardiac subtypes displayed already at this early stage differential characteristics of electrical activity and ion channel expression. Thus, quantitation of the alpha-myosin heavy chain driven reporter gene expression allows identification and functional characterization of early cardiac subtypes."

To gain insight into how the cell cycle progression of undifferentiated murine ES cells is regulated, we have examined the expression patterns of various replication and cell cycle regulators. Most factors including cyclins, Cdc6, and geminin are rather constitutively expressed during the cell cycle of ES cells. Furthermore, the transcript levels of almost all the cell cycle regulators we investigated except for p21 and p27 are higher in undifferentiated ES cells than in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and the increased stability of mRNA in ES cells may be partially responsible for this at least with some of the factors. More strikingly, the transcriptional levels of these factors are strongly correlated with the acetylated state of histone H3 at their promoter regions. However, the methylation state of histone or CpG methylation of the promoter region is not generally correlated significantly with the expression pattern of these factors in both cell types. On the protein level, Cdc6, ASK, cyclin A2, and cyclin B1 are extremely abundant in ES cells compared with MEFs. Furthermore, they are rapidly down-regulated upon induction of differentiation of ES cells.

It has been well documented that ES cells show unusual proliferative features (1.Smith A. Stem Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 205-230Google Scholar). Although they retain a normal diploid karyotype, its growth property resembles that of transformed cells; the growth of ES cells are insensitive to serum starvation, and their proliferation is not restricted by contact inhibition or anchorage dependence. Furthermore, their cell cycle properties are also unique in that ES cells devote more than a half of their entire cycle to S phase and has short gap phases, which explains their rapid proliferation rate (2.Savatier P.

White J. Faast R. Conn S. Goldstone S. Rathjen J. Dhingra U. Rathjen P. Walker D. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8320-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Rb is constitutively in the phosphorylated state (2.Savatier P. Huang S. Szekely L. Wiman K.G. Samarut J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 809-818PubMed Google Scholar), and E2F target genes are actively transcribed throughout the cell cycle (3.Stead E. White J. Faast R. Conn S. Goldstone S. Rathjen J. Dhingra U. Rathjen P. Walker D. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8320-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). On the other hand, conditional knock-out of Cdc7 in ES cells resulted in growth arrest at S phase DNA content (6.Kim J.M. Yamada M. Masai H. Mutat Res. 2003; 532: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that Cdc7-ASK plays an essential role in the progression of ES cell cycle.In this report, we have characterized the expression and chromatin binding patterns of various factors involved in regulation of DNA replication, especially the components and activators of preRC complex, during the cell cycle of undifferentiated ES cells. To further explore the molecular mechanisms underpinning the proliferative feature of undifferentiated ES cells, we also compared the expression of these replication regulators between ES and differentiated somatic cells at both protein and mRNA levels. We found that all the factors we have investigated except for Cdk inhibitors are highly transcribed in ES cells, and that elevated transcriptional activity is strongly correlated with the histone acetylation status of their promoter region. However, at the protein level, only a subset of the factors are highly overexpressed in ES cells, which include Cdc6, ASK, cyclin A2, and cyclin B1. The expression levels of these factors sharply decreased upon induction of differentiation. These results will be discussed in relation to the specific mode of cell cycle regulation of ES cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Synchronization—ES cell lines, CCE28 and D3, were cultured on gelatin-coated culture dishes without feeder layer. The culture medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, ESGRO; 104 units/ml for cell maintenance and 103 units/ml for synchronization or drug treatment). Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (passage 2) and mouse fibroblast cell line L929 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine.For synchronous release from M phase arrest, ES cells were first treated with 2.5 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 12 h, then washed twice with prewarmed PBS and incubated in the presence of 150 ng/ml of TN-16 (Biomol) for 5 h. These cells were washed with PBS and then released into prewarmed medium for the indicated time. For release from G1/S phase, cells were first treated with 2.5 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 12 h, then washed twice with prewarmed PBS and released into prewarmed medium for 6 h. These cells were treated with 0.5 mm mimosine for 6 h, and then, after being washed with PBS, the G1/S-arrested cells were released into prewarmed medium for the indicated time. For synchronization of L929 cells from M phase arrest, they were first treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 15 h then released in the medium containing 150 ng/ml of TN-16 for 8 h. These cells were synchronously released in the prewarmed medium as described above. Other synchronization protocols were described in the legend. For in vitro differentiation of ES cell line CCE28, cells were cultured in the medium without LIF, which was supplemented with 1 μm retinoic acid (Sigma) for indicated periods.Inhibitors—MG132 (proteasome/calpain inhibitor, Calbiochem) and ALLN (calpain inhibitor, Sigma) were used at 10 μm. cycloheximide (50 μg/ml, Calbiochem) and actynomicin D (5 μg/ml, Calbiochem) were used to inhibit mRNA or protein synthesis, respectively.Antibodies—The rabbit polyclonal antibody against murine ASK was developed against His-tagged full-length ASK protein generated in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified with GST-ASK fusion protein. The rabbit antisera against murine MCM4 was developed against GST-MCM4 fusion protein (based on the plasmid originally constructed by Hiroshi Kimura). Antibodies against cyclin E1 (sc-481), cyclin A2 (sc-596), cyclin B1 (sc-245), Cdc6 (sc-9964), Cdk2 (sc-6248), Cdc2 (sc-954), PCNA (sc-56), MCM2 (sc-9839), geminin (sc-13015), Lamin B (sc-6217) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-MCM5 and anti-MCM7 antibodies from Katsuyuki Tamai (MBL), and anti-tubulin antibody (B-5-1-2) from Sigma. For chromatin immunoprecipitation, anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (06-599), and anti-dimethylated histone H3K9 antibody (ab7312) were purchased from Upstate and Abcam, respectively.Immunoblot Analyses—Cells were collected with trypsinization and washed in ice-cold PBS. To prepare whole cell lysates, cell pellets were resuspended in IP lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 tablet of complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (PI tablets, Roche Applied Science)/50 ml) and were sonicated for 10 pulses at output 3 and 50% duty cycle of Branson Sonifier 250. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad). To fractionate cells into Triton X-100-soluble and insoluble fractions, CSK buffer extraction was performed as described previously (22.Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with minor modifications; cells were lysed on ice for 5 min in CSK buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and PI tablets. Soluble fractions (30 μg) and insoluble fractions of equivalent numbers of cells were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblot analysis.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from ES cells and MEFs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA (15 μg) was separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and was transferred onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were generated by RT-PCR using the primer sets shown in Table SI (see Supplemental Materials). These primer pairs were designed to amplify the regions including intron to avoid contamination of the DNA amplified from genomic DNA. After the prehybridization of membranes in prehybridization solution (6× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 50% formaldehyde, and 100 μg/ml denatured DNA (Nacalai)) for at least 3 h, 32P-labeled probes (prepared using the Megaprime DNA labeling system from Amersham Biosciences) were added and hybridization was conducted at 42 °C for overnight. Membranes were washed in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min, and then washed three times in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 20 min each.Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—RNA (5 μg) from ES cells and MEFs were converted to cDNA with expand reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. 1:40 volume of reverse transcription mixtures were used to amplify each cDNA fragment with primer pairs shown in Table SI (Supplemental Materials). All the cDNA fragments except for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were amplified using TaqDNA polymerase (Sigma) with 15 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. The GAPDH cDNA fragment was amplified with 10 cycles of the same PCR condition. Under this condition, the target cDNA fragments were amplified linearly at least up to 20 cycles (data not shown). Amplified DNA fragments separated on an agarose gel were detected by Southern blotting using the same cDNA fragments as probes which were 32P-labeled as above.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP analyses were performed as described previously (23.Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. ES cells and MEFs were trypsinized and cross-linked in cell culture medium containing 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. After the reaction was stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m and was incubated for 5 min, 1 × 107 cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 400 μl of SDS buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS), supplemented with PI tablet, and stored at -80 °C. For sonication, 200 μl of Triton dilution buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and PI tablet) was added, and samples were processed with the Branson sonifier 250 for 50 s at output 5 and 100% duty cycle to yield the average DNA length of 800 bp. The chromatin solution was adjusted to 5 × 106 cells/500 μl in IP buffer (2:1 mixture of SDS buffer and Triton dilution buffer) for each sample, and were precleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min with protein A-Sepharose beads. Then, the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1 μg of antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed and eluted as described (9.Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Eluted DNA, after ethanol precipitation, was resuspended in 200 μl of water and 10 μl was used for PCR (26–33 cycles). Linear range for detection with each primer set was predetermined using diluted input DNA. All the experiments were conducted at least twice with independently immunoprecipitated samples. The primer sets used are shown in Table SII (Supplemental Materials). The primer sets for the promoters of p21, p27, and Oct-3/4 were the same as previously described (24.Lagger G. O'Carroll D. Rembold M. Khier H. Tischler J. Weitzer G. Schuettengruber B. Hauser C. Brunmeir R. Jenuwein T. Seiser C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 25.Lee J.H. Hart S.R. Skalnik D.G. Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).Methylation Assays—Genomic DNA (2 μg) from undifferentiated ES cells, retinoic acid-treated ES cells, MEFs, and tail were digested with HpaII or MspI, and 5 ng of the resulting digest were used for PCR. The primer sets used in this study were the same as those used in the ChIP assay (Table SII) or otherwise shown in Table SIII (Supplemental Materials).RESULTSCell Cycle-dependent Expression of Replication Regulators in Murine Embryonic Stem Cells—To analyze the cell cycle regulation of factors regulating DNA replication of ES cells, we arrested the CCE28 ES cell line at the G2/M with TN-16 treatment following release from double thymidine block and then synchronously released into cell cycle (Fig. 1A). On the basis of the FACS analyses of DNA content, it was estimated that these cells spend ∼1 h in G2/M, another 1 h in G1, and 7 h in S phase. This cell cycle profile is consistent with previous reports on different murine ES cell lines. We have fractionated the cells into Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions (22.Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); the former contains both cytoplasmic and nuclear soluble proteins and the latter contains nuclear insoluble proteins including chromatin-bound ones (Fig. 1B).Cdc6 protein was detected mostly in the Triton-insoluble fraction throughout the cell cycle, and its level was rather constant. The mobility-shifted form observed at time 0 (immediately after release from TN-16 arrest), was likely to be caused by the phosphorylation, because it disappeared upon phosphatase treatment (data not shown). ASK, the activation subunit of Cdc7 kinase, was more enriched in the Triton-soluble fraction throughout the cell cycle. It was not detected in the Triton-insoluble fractions at the time of release, and reappeared in the chromatin-enriched fraction within 1 h from the release. ASK protein appeared as a series of multiple bands generated by phosphorylation, since λ phosphatase treatment resulted in disappearance of all the shifted bands and convergence into a single band of ∼75 kDa (see Fig. 6A). It was previously reported that transcription of ASK in somatic cells was induced when they were released from serum starvation and progressed into S phase (26.Kumagai H. Sato N. Yamada M. Mahony D. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that ASK protein in ES cells dissociates from chromatin during G2/M phase and reassociates at G1/S phase, although the expression level of the total protein is rather constant during the cell cycle. MCM2 and MCM4 proteins were also not detected in the chromatin-enriched fractions at the time of release, but were loaded onto chromatin within 1 h after release. The levels of the chromatin-bound MCM proteins gradually decreased as the S phase proceeded. MCM2 appeared as a doublet in Triton-soluble fractions, the lower of which represents phosphorylated forms. The level of this mobility-shifted form decreased as cells entered S phase, and increased again at late S through G2 phase. A portion of MCM4 in the Triton-soluble fractions also became mobility-shifted because of phosphorylation during G2/M-early G1 phase. Similar phosphorylation-induced mobility shift of MCM4 protein during G2/M phase was previously observed in human somatic cells (27.Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The level of chromatin-bound PCNA protein increased during the S phase, consistent with its association with the sites of DNA replication (28.Madsen P. Celis J.E. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29.Prosperi E. Scovassi A.I. Stivala L.A. Bianchi L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Fig. 6Cdc6 is destabilized in differentiated cells.A, ES cells and MEFs were treated with 50 μg/ml of CHX for increasing times, and 15 μg of the whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies indicated. +PPase indicate that the lysates were pretreated with λ-phosphatase (New England BioLabs, 30 units for 30 min). For MEFs, the blot with five times more lysate is also shown (indicated as MEF (×5)). B, intensities of the bands in A are quantified, and the values relative to that at time 0 are presented for each gene. Data shown are the averages of two independent experiments. C, ES cells and MEFs were treated with 10 μm MG132 (M) or ALLN (A) for 6 h. Whole cell lysates (5 μg) were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies indicated. For MEFs, the blot with ten times more lysate are also shown (indicated as MEF (×10)). D, intensities of the bands in C were quantified and the ratio of drug-treated/untreated samples are presented for Cdc6 with each inhibitor. Data shown are the averages of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It was previously reported that cyclin B1 is the only cyclin the level of which markedly fluctuates during the cell cycle of ES cells (3.Stead E. White J. Faast R. Conn S. Goldstone S. Rathjen J. Dhingra U. Rathjen P. Walker D. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8320-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We observed rather moderate fluctuation of cyclin B1 protein, which was abundant at the time of TN-16 arrest, slightly decreased during G1/S phase and reincreased at G2/M phase. Cyclin A2 also weakly fluctuated in a manner similar to cyclin B1. On the other hand, we did not detect significant change of cyclin E1 protein level, consistent with the previous report (3.Stead E. White J. Faast R. Conn S. Goldstone S. Rathjen J. Dhingra U. Rathjen P. Walker D. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8320-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The conflict with previous reports could be caused by the difference of the synchronization protocols. Therefore, we synchronized ES cells by release from mimosine-arrest at G1/S phase. In this experiment, we used two different ES cell lines, CCE28 and D3, and pattern of cell cycle oscillation of various factors were examined (Fig. 1, C and D). Basically, we obtained almost identical results with the two cell lines. Consistent with above results, the levels of chromatin-bound ASK protein increased during early S phase, and decreased as cells completed S phase and entered G2 phase. We also noticed that the extent of the mobility shift of ASK decreased during S phase, and reincreased at G2 phase, which may be caused by phosphorylation by Cdc2. Cdc6 protein level did not change much during the cell cycle and was detected mostly in the chromatin bound fraction. Cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 protein levels did not significantly change during this synchronization procedure. Total MCM2 protein level was constant, but that in the Triton-insoluble fraction decreased and the mobility-shifted phosphorylated form increased in the Triton-soluble fraction, as S phase progressed. These results are consistent with those of cells synchronized from G2/M block.We also examined the cell cycle profile of expression of these factors in mouse fibroblast cell line L929, which were synchronously released from M-phase arrest (Fig. 1E). Cells completed M phase within 2 h after release, and entered S phase at about 4 h after release. S phase was completed by 10 h after release and entered next G1 phase by 12 h. In this cell line, cyclin B1, detected mostly in Triton-soluble fraction, significantly fluctuated during the cell cycle and peaked in G2/M phase. Cyclin A2 weakly fluctuated, increasing in late S to G2/M phase. Geminin also disappeared in G1 phase and reappeared during S to G2/M phase, consistent with previous report. Thus, the levels of these factors oscillated to a larger extent than in ES cells. However, the protein levels of ASK and Cdc6 appeared to be almost constant during the cell cycle. In this cell line, the cyclin E1 protein level only slightly increased during G1 and the extent of oscillation was much smaller. The level of phosphorylation of some of these factors (MCM2, ASK, and Cdc6) was enhanced during G2/M as indicated by the extent of mobility shift. The majority of MCM2 and ASK was in the Triton-soluble fractions at the time of TN-16 arrest, but a significant fraction was detected in Triton-insoluble fractions within 2 h after release. These changes were similar to what were observed in ES cells. Thus, the nearly constitutive expression of cell cycle and replication factors during cell cycle appears to be a unique characteristic of undifferentiated ES cells.ASK, Cdc6, Cyclin A2, and Cyclin B1 Proteins Are Extremely Overexpressed in Undifferentiated ES Cells—To investigate the factors responsible for cell cycle regulation specific to undifferentiated ES cells, we compared the expression patterns of replication factors between ES and MEFs. The protein levels of various factors involved in DNA replication were determined in asynchronously growing ES and MEFs by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Among the proteins examined, ASK, Cdc6, cyclin A2, and cyclin B1 proteins were expressed at a high level in ES cells, whereas they were expressed at a much lower level in MEFs. On the other hand, MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM7, cyclin E1, Cdk2, and Cdc2 were expressed at a similar level in both cells. PCNA, MCM5, and geminin were expressed in ES cells at a level slightly higher than that in MEFs (data not shown). In agreement with the recent report, cyclin D3 was expressed at a similar level in undifferentiated ES cells and MEFs (30.Faast R. White J. Cartwright P. Crocker L. Sarcevic B. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas cyclin D1 and D2, expressed at a high level in MEF, were expressed only at a very low level in ES cells, consistent with low or very little transcription of these genes in ES cells (30.Faast R. White J. Cartwright P. Crocker L. Sarcevic B. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31.Jirmanova L. Afanassieff M. Gobert-Gosse S. Markossian S. Savatier P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5515-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27 were not expressed to a detectable level in ES cells, but at a significant level in MEFs (3.Stead E. White J. Faast R. Conn S. Goldstone S. Rathjen J. Dhingra U. Rathjen P. Walker D. Dalton S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8320-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).Because cell cycle profile of asynchronously growing ES and MEFs were different, the observed differential expression of cell cycle factors could be caused by difference of cell cycle distribution. To examine this possibility, we synchronized ES cells at G1 phase by mimosine treatment or release from TN-16 arrest, which resulted in cell populations with DNA content similar to that of asynchronously growing MEFs (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions as well, the levels of the four protein"
https://openalex.org/W2037393544,"Humanin (HN) is a recently identified endogenous peptide that protects cells against cytotoxicity induced by various stimuli. Recently, we showed that HN binds to and inhibits Bax, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, suggesting a mechanism for HN action. In this study, we identified Bim, a Bcl-2 homology 3-only member of the Bcl-2/Bax family, as an additional HN target protein. Using in vitro protein binding, immunoprecipitation, and coimmunolocalization assays, we demonstrated that HN binds directly to the extra long isoform of Bim (BimEL) but not the long (BimL) or short (BimS) isoforms. HN also protects cells against apoptosis induced by BimEL but not BimL and BimS in gene transfection studies. In contrast, mutants of HN which failed to bind BimEL failed to protect from BimEL-induced cell death. Moreover, HN inhibited BimEL-induced release of SMAC and cytochrome c from mitochondria isolated from bax–/–cells, indicating that HN can suppress BimEL independently of its effect on Bax. Finally, we demonstrate that HN prevents BimEL-induced oligomerization of Bak using isolated mitochondria. Taken together, our results indicate that the inhibition of BimEL may contribute to the antiapoptotic properties of the HN peptide.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a genetically regulated cellular suicide mechanism that plays critical roles in normal development, tissue homeostasis, and elimination of infected or damaged cells (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar, 2Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6170) Google Scholar). Mitochondria represent crucial organelles for the integration of various cell death stimuli and execution of the cell death program (3Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Mitochondria are capable of releasing several apoptogenic proteins into the cytosol, including cytochrome c, AIF, SMAC/Diablo, endonuclease G, and Omi/HtrA2 (5Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). The integrity of mitochondrial membranes is controlled primarily by a balance between the antagonistic actions of the proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family.

Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4754) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain mediates interactions among Bcl-2 family proteins, allowing for networks of protein interactions (7Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Most BOPs function as antagonists of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. However, some BOPs operate as both antagonists of the antiapoptotic proteins and as agonists of proapoptotic family members Bax and Bak. These agonists bind via their BH3 domains, inducing oligomerization of Bax and Bak. The pore-forming capability of oligomerized Bax and Bak results in the destabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and the subsequent release of the death molecules from the confines of these organelles. Cells derived from bax/bak double knock-out mice are resistant to a wide spectrum of apoptotic stimuli, including BOPs (9Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J.

Bim is expressed in hematopoietic, epithelial, neuronal, and germ cells (12O'Reilly L.A. Cullen L. Visvader J. Lindeman G.J. Print C. Bath M.L. Huang D.C. Strasser A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and alternative mRNA splicing generates three major isoforms: short (BimS), long (BimL), and extra long (BimEL), with BimEL representing the predominant isoform in most tissues. Recent studies using gene knock-out mice have identified the bim gene as a major regulator of apoptosis in the lymphoid system. bim plays a critical role in thymic education and peripheral deletion of T lymphocytes, as well as myeloid cell homeostasis (13Bouillet P.

Bouillet P. Strasser A. Kappler J. Marrack P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The bim gene is also required for death of B lymphocytes in response to cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin (16Enders A. Bouillet P. Puthalakath H. Xu Y. Tarlinton D.M. Strasser A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Bim proteins also trigger apoptosis in neurons, hematopoietic progenitors, and other types of cells (13Bouillet P. Metcalf D.

Auberger P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6785-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In healthy cells, BimEL and BimL are sequestrated on the microtubular dynein motor complex through direct interaction with the dynein light chain LC8 (23Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In contrast, BimS does not bind to LC8, a situation that may explain the superior potency of BimS compared with BimEL and BimL in gene transfection-based apoptosis assays. Certain stress conditions, such as cytokine deprivation, γ-irradiation, and exposure to microtubule-targeting drugs, cause release of BimEL and BimL from the dynein motor complex, resulting in their translocation to mitochondria. Bim is among the few BOPs that can function as agonists of Bax and Bak, inducing oligomerization of these proteins in a BH3-dependent manner and triggering apoptogenic changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability (10Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). By functional screening of a brain cDNA library derived from an Alzheimer disease patient, Hashimoto et al. (24Hashimoto Y. Ito Y. Niikura T. Shao Z. Hata M. Oyama F. Nishimoto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Ito Y. Sudo H. Hata M. Arakawa E. Abe Y. Kita Y. Nishimoto I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9235-9245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified an endogenous peptide, termed Humanin (HN), which suppresses neuronal cell death initiated by Alzheimer disease-related insults, including amyloid β-peptide and mutant presenilins in primary neurons and neuronal cell lines. HN is a short 24-residue polypeptide, MAPRGFSCLLLLSEIDLPVKRRA, which is apparently produced at the highest levels in testis, colon, Alzheimer disease-affected brain tissue, and some tumor cell lines (27Tajima H. Niikura T. Hashimoto Y. Ito Y. Kita Y. Terashita K. Yamazaki K. Koto A. Aiso S. Nishimoto I. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 324: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for regulating levels of HN peptide in vivo are unknown, although post-translational control of HN protein stability by interactions with other proteins is among the reported possibilities (23Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an open reading frame corresponding to HN is found embedded in a ribosome gene within the mitochondrial genome, in addition to HN-encoding genes within the nuclear genomes of several animal species (11O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of gene transfer from mitochondrial to nuclear genome. The cytoprotective mechanism of HN has been controversial. Early data suggested that HN is secreted from cells (24Hashimoto Y. Ito Y. Niikura T. Shao Z. Hata M. Oyama F. Nishimoto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 29Yamagishi Y. Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Nishimoto I. Peptides. 2003; 24: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and implied that a cell surface receptor is targeted by this peptide. More recently, however, our laboratory discovered an alternative mechanism of action for HN, showing that this peptide binds to Bax and prevents the translocation of this proapoptotic protein from cytosol to mitochondria, thereby protecting cells from apoptosis-inducing insults that trigger the mitochondrial (but not nonmitochondrial) pathway for cell death (28Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In contrast, HN does not bind multiple other Bcl-2 family members, including Bak, Bok, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and Bcl-B. Here, we extended the protective action of HN by identifying BimEL as a new target of HN. We demonstrate that the specific binding of HN to BimEL abolishes its proapoptotic activity by preventing BimEL-induced activation of Bax and Bak and protecting cells from BimEL-induced cell death. Although the normal in vivo targets of HN remain to be clarified, these results broaden the scope of proapoptotic Bcl-2/Bax family proteins that the HN peptide is capable of antagonizing, suggesting expanded opportunities for exploiting this antiapoptotic peptide directly or indirectly for possible development of cytoprotective therapies. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293T, HeLa, MEF bax+/+, MEF bax–/–, and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium (Irvine Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units ml–1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml–1 streptomycin at 37 °C. Transfection of cells was performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid Constructions and Directed Mutagenesis—pEF-PGKhygro expression plasmids incorporating the N-terminal EE (EYMPME) epitope tag and encoding BimEL, BimL, and BimS have been described previously (22Luciano F. Jacquel A. Colosetti P. Herrant M. Cagnol S. Pages G. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6785-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA3-myc-Bcl-XL, incorporating a myc epitope tag, has also been described previously (28Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding human Bak was subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech). A cDNA containing the open reading frame of HN without additional flanking sequences was generated by PCR using an expressed sequence tag clone encoding full-length HN as a template (BE899497). The resulting PCR products were digested with restriction endonucleases and subcloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Site-specific mutants of HN were created by PCR using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). For replacing cysteine 8 with proline (HN(C8P)), the following primers (XX IDT) were used: sense, 5′-CCACGAGGGTTCAGCCCTCTCTTACTTTTAACC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGTTAAAAGTAAGAGAGGGCTGAACCCTCGTGG-3′. Mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. The pRSET-BimEL plasmid encoding the recombinant His6-tagged BimEL protein was a generous gift of Yoshide Tsujimoto (30Sugiyama T. Shimizu S. Matsuoka Y. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4944-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitations—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously, using cell lysates normalized for total protein content (28Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitations, cells were cultured in 50 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (ZVAD-fmk; Bachem) to prevent apoptosis. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg ml–1 leupeptin, 20 μg ml–1 aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates (500 μl) were then incubated with 1.5 μg of polyclonal Bim antibody (Sigma) or monoclonal anti-EE antibody (Babco) and 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and performing SDS-PAGE, transferring to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotting. Antibodies employed for antigen detection included polyclonal anti-Bim antibody (Sigma) and polyclonal and monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Santa Cruz). Fluorescence Polarization Assays (FPAs)—For FPAs, various concentrations of His6-BimEL or His6-SMAC fusion proteins were incubated with 40 nm FITC-conjugated synthetic purified HN peptide for 10 min in the dark in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, as described previously (28Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Fluorescence polarization was measured in PBS buffer, using an Analyst AD Assay Detection System (LJL Biosystem). Microscopy Analysis—COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-HN, pEFP-GK-BimEL, -BimL, or -BimS in the presence of 50 μm ZVAD-fmk. After 48 h, cells were fixed with PBS containing 3% formaldehyde and 2% sucrose for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum for 20 min at room temperature. Then, fixed cells were successively incubated with monoclonal anti-EE mAb (Babco) for 2 h at room temperature, washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Southern Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Caspase Activity Measurements—The caspase-3-like protease activity in cell lysates was measured using a fluorometric substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (Alexis Corporation, San Diego), which was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored as a 10 mm solution at –20 °C. HEK293T cells were collected, washed in cold PBS, and lysed at 4 °C in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40). Homogenates were centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 10 min), and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of supernatants (normalized for protein content) were mixed in wells of 96-well microtiter plates in a 100-μl final volume, in buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 0.5% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm Ac-DEVD-AFC substrate (caspase-3/7)). Substrate cleavage was monitored continuously by spectrofluorometry, in kinetic mode, using Fluorolite 1000 (Dynatech Laboratories). Data are reported as relative fluorescence units of product produced/min/10 μg of total protein. Data were analyzed using the PRISM Statistics software package employing an unpaired t test method. Apoptosis Assay—HEK293T cells were transfected as described above. After 18 h, both floating and adherent cells (after trypsinization) were collected, washed with PBS, fixed with PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde, and stained with 2 μg/ml DAPI in PBS to visualize the nuclei by ultraviolet microscopy. The percentages of apoptotic cells were determined by counting 200 GFP-positive cells, scoring cells having nuclear fragmentation and/or chromatin condensation as apoptotic (mean ± S.D.; n = 3). Protein Purification—The recombinant His6-tagged fusion protein BimEL was expressed from pRSET-BimEL plasmid transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3. Briefly, cells were grown in 2 liters of Luria-Bertani broth with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to a A600 of 1.0, then 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the cultures were incubated at 25 °C for 4 h. Cells were then recovered and incubated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by sonication. Cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatants were applied to nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose resin (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). The His6-BimEL·Ni-NTA complex was washed five times with 20 column volumes of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.25 m imidazole in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc synthesis and DIC/HOBt coupling with an Advanced Chem Tech 350 multiple peptide synthesizer. HN and its derivatives were synthesized on Fmoc-Alanine Wang resin to give peptides with N-terminal amino groups and C-terminal carboxyl groups. HN-Ahx-r8, its derivatives, and other peptides were synthesized on Rink amide resin. The HN-Ahx-r8 peptides were amidated on the C termini and had N-terminal amino ends. The Bak BH3 peptide was acetylated and amidated on the ends. FITC-HN is MAPRGFSCLLLLSEIDLPVK(FITC)RRA with FITC linked to the Lys side chain. Fmoc amino acids and resins were purchased from Nova Biochem. In the synthesis of HN and its derivatives, Fmoc-(FmocHmb)Leu-OH was used for assembling Leu11, and the symmetric anhydride of Fmoc-leucine was used for adding Leu10 to the sterically hindered (Hmb)Leu. Fmoc-Lys(Mtt) was used in addition to the above for the synthesis of FITC-HN. The peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with 94% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% H2O, 2.5% 1,2-dithioethane, and 1% triisopropysilane for 2 h at room temperature; r8 peptides were treated for 6 h. The crude peptides were obtained by the addition of cold diethyl ether and purified with a Gilson high performance liquid chromatography instrument. The purified peptides was analyzed and confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass analysis with an Applied Biosystems Voyager System 6264. Mitochondria Purification—Mitochondria were isolated from HeLa, MEF bax+/+, and bax–/–cells. Mitochondria were purified using a differential centrifugation method. Briefly, cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed, and resuspended in fractionation buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mmd-mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 μg ml–1 leupeptin, 20 μg ml–1 aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were homogenized by 70 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged twice at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells, which were discarded. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the mitochondria pellet was washed twice with fractionation buffer. Mitochondria were finally resuspended in fractionation buffer at 5 μg/μl and used within 2 h. Mitochondria Protein Release Assays—Purified recombinant human His6-BimEL (10–600 ng) was preincubated with or without various concentrations of synthetic HN peptide or mutant HN(C8P) peptide for 10 min at room temperature. The untreated or peptide pretreated BimEL protein samples were then mixed with 50 μg of mitochondria in a total volume of 50 μl of fractionation buffer at 30 °C for 1 h. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain pellet and supernatant fractions, measuring cytochrome c, SMAC, and Hsp60 by immunoblotting using monoclonal cytochrome c antibody (BD Biosciences), rabbit polyclonal SMAC antibody, and monoclonal Hsp60 antibody (Stressgen). Bak Oligomerization Assays—Bak oligomers were detected using the noncleavable protein cross-linker, bismaleimidoxane (BMH). BMH stock solution was prepared at 100 mm dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Various amounts of recombinant His6-BimEL alone or together with various concentrations of HN peptide were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature in fractionation buffer, then 50 μg of isolated mitochondria from bax–/–MEF cells was added to a final volume of 50 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, 10 mm BMH cross-linker was added for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting (12% gels) using polyclonal anti-Bak antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Bax Activation Assays—To examine conformational changes in Bax associated with activation of this protein, 100 μg of mitochondria was lysed in fractionation buffer supplemented with 1% CHAPS and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Bax 6A7 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Then, the resulting immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting using polyclonal Bax (N-20) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). SMAC Antibody Production—Polyclonal antisera recognizing SMAC were generated in New Zealand White rabbits using peptide (AR-49) or recombinant protein (AR-50A; B) immunogens. SMAC recombinant protein was produced as a GST fusion protein and affinity-purified as described previously (31Schendel S.L. Azimov R. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Kagan B.L. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21932-21936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The SMAC anti-peptide antibody (AR-49) was generated using a synthetic peptide (NH2-AVPLAQKSEPHSLSSEALC-amide) corresponding to residues 55–73 of human (hu) SMAC, which was synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine appended to permit conjugation to maleimide-activated carrier proteins keyhole limpet hemocyanin and ovalbumin (Pierce, Inc.) (32Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Miyashita T. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1323-1336PubMed Google Scholar). The monospecificity of all antibodies for their intended protein targets was confirmed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis. HN Binds to BimEL—We showed previously that HN can bind the proapoptotic protein Bax but not several other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (28Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). During attempts to extend studies of HN to other Bcl-2 family proteins, we noticed binding to BimEL by both coimmunoprecipitation from cell lysates containing the expressed proteins and by in vitro protein binding assays. For example, using lysates from HEK293T cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding BimEL and HN (expressed with an N-terminal GFP), we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-Bim polyclonal antibody and analyzed the resulting immune complexes for associated GFP-HN by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). These experiments demonstrated that GFP-HN can interact with both endogenous (lane 3) or transfected (lane 4) BimEL (expressed here with an N-terminal EE epitope tag). In contrast, GFP control protein did not associate with BimEL. Similar results were obtained using HN expressed with a C-terminal GFP (data not shown). Direct interaction of HN with BimEL was demonstrated by FPAs using recombinant purified BimEL protein and a FITC-conjugated synthetic HN peptide. Mixing various concentrations of His6-BimEL with a fixed amount of FITC-HN peptide resulted in concentration-dependent increases in fluorescence polarization, allowing an estimate of affinity of the interaction of Kd = 50 nm. In contrast, His6-SMAC protein did not bind the FITC-HN peptide, serving as a specificity control (Fig. 1B). We then compared BimEL with the two other Bim isoforms, BimL and BimS, generated by alternative splicing (Fig. 1C). For these experiments, we coexpressed the three isoforms of Bim, BimEL, BimL, and BimS, as EE-tagged proteins along with GFP-HN in HEK293T cells by cotransfection. With these cell lysates, we preformed immunoprecipitations using monoclonal anti-EE antibody and analyzed the resulting immune complexes using anti-GFP antibody to detect associated GFP-HN (Fig. 1D). Although BimEL, BimL, and BimS were all recovered from ly"
https://openalex.org/W2062799405,"Heparanase is an endo-β-d-glucuronidase that degrades heparan sulfate in the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces. Human proheparanase is produced as a latent 65-kDa polypeptide undergoing processing at two potential proteolytic cleavage sites, located at Glu109-Ser110 (site 1) and Gln157-Lys158 (site 2). Cleavage of proheparanase yields 8- and 50-kDa subunits that heterodimerize to form the active enzyme. The fate of the linker segment (Ser110-Gln157) residing between the two subunits, the mode of processing, and the protease(s) engaged in proheparanase processing are currently unknown. We applied multiple site-directed mutagenesis and deletions to study the nature of the potential cleavage sites and amino acids essential for processing of proheparanase in transfected human choriocarcinoma cells devoid of endogenous heparanase but possessing the enzymatic machinery for proper processing and activation of the proenzyme. Although mutagenesis at site 1 and its flanking sequences failed to identify critical residues for proteolytic cleavage, processing at site 2 required a bulky hydrophobic amino acid at position 156 (i.e. P2 of the cleavage site). Substitution of Tyr156 by Ala or Glu, but not Val, resulted in cleavage at an upstream site in the linker segment, yielding an improperly processed inactive enzyme. Processing of the latent 65-kDa proheparanase in transfected Jar cells was inhibited by a cell-permeable inhibitor of cathepsin L. Moreover, recombinant 65-kDa proheparanase was processed and activated by cathepsin L in a cell-free system. Altogether, these results suggest that proheparanase processing at site 2 is brought about by cathepsin L-like proteases. The involvement of other members of the cathepsin family with specificity to bulky hydrophobic residues cannot be excluded. Our results and a three-dimensional model of the enzyme are expected to accelerate the design of inhibitory molecules capable of suppressing heparanase-mediated enhancement of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.

Moreover, by binding a multitude of proteins, HSPGs ensure that bioactive molecules such as growth factors, chemokines, lipoproteins, and enzymes are localized to the cell surface and ECM and function in the control of normal and pathological processes (5.David G.

The heparanase cDNA encodes for a latent 65-kDa proheparanase of 543 amino acids. It undergoes proteolytic processing that is likely to occur at two cleavage sites, yielding an 8-kDa peptide, corresponding to the N terminus of the protein, a 50-kDa polypeptide at the C terminus, and a 6-kDa linker peptide between these regions (18.Levy-Adam F.

The active form of the enzyme has first been thought to be a 50-kDa polypeptide, isolated from cells and tissues. However, attempts to obtain heparanase activity in cells transfected with the 50-kDa polypeptide have failed (18.Levy-Adam F. Miao H.Q. Heinrikson R.L. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Purified active heparanase appears in SDS-PAGE as a 50-kDa protein accompanied by an 8-kDa polypeptide, suggesting that the active form of the enzyme exists as a heterodimer composed of a 50-kDa subunit (Lys158-Ile543) noncovalently associated with an 8-kDa subunit (Gln36 to Glu109) (20.Fairbanks M.B.

Indeed, coexpression of the 8- and 50-kDa heparanase subunits demonstrated that heterodimer formation is necessary and sufficient for heparanase enzymatic activity (18.Levy-Adam F. Miao H.Q.

Yet, the mechanism of proteolytic processing and activation of the proenzyme is largely unknown. We applied site-directed mutagenesis to study the amino acid sequence context at cleavage sites 1 and 2 in the human proheparanase. Our results indicate that cleavage at site 2 is brought about by an endoproteolytic activity, most likely cathepsin L, with specificity to a bulky hydrophobic amino acid at position P2 (i.e. Tyr156, one amino acid N-terminal to the P1 cleavage site).

Cultures of bovine corneal endothelial cells were established from steer eyes and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g/liter glucose) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum and 10% fetal calf serum, as described previously (23.Vlodavsky I. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1999: 10.14.11-10.14.14Google Scholar). Preparation of Dishes Coated with ECM—Bovine corneal endothelial cells (second to fifth passages) were plated onto 35-mm tissue culture dishes at an initial density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and cultured as described above, except that 4% dextran T-40 was included in the growth medium. Na 352SO4 (25 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) was added on days 2 and 5 after seeding, and the cells were incubated with the label without medium change. On day 12, the sub-endothelial ECM was exposed by dissolving the cell layer with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 20 mm NH4OH, followed by four washes with phosphate-buffered saline (10.Goldshmidt O. Zcharia E. Abramovitch R. Metzger S. Aingorn H. Friedmann Y. Schirrmacher V. Mitrani E. Vlodavsky I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heparanase Activity—Cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing in heparanase reaction solution (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2). Cell lysates were incubated (24 h, 37 °C, pH 5.8) with 35S-labeled ECM. The medium was centrifuged, and the supernatant containing the sulfate-labeled degradation fragments was analyzed by gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-6B column (0.9 × 30 cm). Fractions (0.2 ml) were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline, and their radioactivity was counted in a β-scintillation counter (15.Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R.

Each experiment was performed at least three times, and the variation in elution positions (Kav values) did not exceed ±15%. Generation of Heparanase Mutant cDNAs and Expression Constructs—Mutants of the human heparanase cDNAs were constructed according to site-specific mutagenesis by overlap extension approach (25.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 13.36-13.39Google Scholar). Briefly, for each mutation, two fragments were amplified in two separate PCR reactions using the heparanase cDNA as a template. PCR 1 amplified the fragment that contains the mutation site together with the upstream sequence, utilizing reverse primer containing the mutation and a common forward primer containing the wild type heparanase sequence (1UERIhpa). PCR 2 amplified the DNA fragment that contains the mutation site together with downstream sequences, utilizing the forward primer containing the mutation and a common reverse primer containing the wild type heparanase sequence (4Lhpa). The two PCR-purified (JETquick gel extraction spin kit, Genomed, BadOeynhausen, Germany) fragments were mixed, denatured, annealed, and extended, and the product was amplified in a third PCR reaction using 1UERIhpa and 4Lhpa primers. The PCR 3 product was subcloned into Hpa-pcDNA3 digested with EcoRI and AflII, using a TaKaRa DNA ligation kit II (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). The external primers are: 1UERIhpa, 5′-CTTCAGCATCTTAGCCGTCTTT-3′ and 4Lhpa, 5′-GCAGCCAGGTGAATTCCCAAGAT-3′. The reverse and forward primers for each mutation were as follows: Mutant #1 (109ES110:QQ), 5′-CAAGAAGCAACAGACCTTTGAA-3′ and 5′-TTCAAAGGTCTGTTGCTTCTTGGG-3′. Mutant #2 (107KK108:QQ), 5′-TTCGATCCCCAGCAGGAATCAA-3′ and 5′-TTGATTCCTGCTGGGGATCGAA-3′. Mutant #3 (105DP106:QQ), 5′-CTAATTTTCGCTGCCAAGAAGGA-3′ and 5′-TGGCAGCGAAAATTAGGAAGTCT-3′. Mutant #4 (ΔSTFEER), 5′-AAGAAGGAAAGAAGTTACTGGCAATCTCAAGTC-3′ and 5′-GTAACTCTTTCCTTCTTGGGATCGAAAATTA-3′. Mutant #5 (ΔSTFEERSYWQS), 5′-AAGAAGGAACAAGTCAACCAGGATATTT-3′ and 5′-AAATATCCTGGTTGACTTGTTCCTTCTT-3′. Mutant #6 (Q157A), 5′-CGAGAACACTACGCTGCTAAGTTCGCTAACAGC-3′ and 5′-TGCTGTTAGCGAACTTAGCAGCGTAGTGTTCTCG-3′. Mutant #7 (157RKK-159:QQQ), 5′-CTACTCCAAGAACACTACCAGCAACAGTTCAAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTCTTGAACTGTTGCTGGTAGTGTTCTTGGAGTAG-3′. Mutant #8 (K158A), 5′-CACTACCAGCAATTCCAGAACAGCA-3′ and 5′-TGCTGTTCTGGAACTTTTGCTGGTAGTG-3′. Mutant #9 (K159A), 5′-CACTACCAGAAAGCGTTCAAGA-3′ and 5′-TTCTTGAACGCTTTCTGGTAGT-3′. Mutant #10 (R153A), 5′-TTGCTACTCCAAGAACACTACCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTAGTGTTCTTGGAGTAGCAA-3′. Mutant 11 (Y156A), 5′-CGAGAACACGCCCAGAAAAAGT-3′ and 5′-ACTTTTTCTGGGCGTGTTCTCG-3′. Mutant #12 (Y156E), 5′-CGAGAACACGAGCAGAAAAAGT-3′ and 5′-ACTTTTTCTGCTCGTGTTCTCG-3′. Mutant 13 (Y156V), 5′-CGAGAACACGTCCAGAAAAAGT-3′ and 5′-ACTTTTTCTGGACGTGTTCTCG-3′. Mutant 14 (E154A), 5′-CTACTCCGAGCACACTACCAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTGGTAGTGTGCTCGGAGTAG-3′. Mutant 15 (151LL152:AA), 5′-AGGAGCAATTGGCAGCCCGAGAACACT-3′ and 5′-AGTGTTCTCGGGCTGCCAATTGCTCCT-3′. All PCR reactions were performed using the Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 3 min followed by 32 cycles at 96 °C for 18 s, 60 °C for 90 s, and an elongation step at 72 °C for 70 s. Transfection—Jar cells were transfected (48 h at 37 °C) with pcDNA3 vectors containing the wild type or mutated full-length heparanase cDNA, using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) instructions. Transfected cells were then selected with 600 μg/ml G418, and stable populations of heparanase expressing cells were obtained (10.Goldshmidt O. Zcharia E. Abramovitch R. Metzger S. Aingorn H.

SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Transfected Jar cells (1 × 107) were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1% Brij supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and protein concentration in the supernatants was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Samples (3 mg of total protein) were added to 60 μl of heparin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed once in 0.6 m NaCl followed by two washes in saline and boiling (5 min) in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To detect the 8-kDa subunit, the 0.6 m NaCl wash was avoided, and the beads were washed twice with saline alone. Supernatants were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (4 ml of 10% acrylamide and 4 ml of 18% acrylamide) under reducing conditions, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was performed using anti-heparanase polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against the full-length 65-kDa human proheparanase (Ab1453), synthetic peptides residing in the 8-kDa subunit (Ab810; 96GTKTDFLIFDPKK108), or the linker segment (AbCKLE; 127CKYGSIPPDVEEKLRLE143). Antibody #1453 was affinity-purified using an immobilized 50-kDa subunit (AP1453). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was probed with the appropriate antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) (18.Levy-Adam F.

Computer Modeling of Heparanase—A thre-dimensional model of heparanase was generated using Modeler (DS Modeling, Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) and the structure of β-d-xylosidase (1px8, PDB code) as a template. Alignment was provided by the threading server 3D-PSSM (28.Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 29.Fischer D.

Model building was followed by energy minimization using CHARMm (DS Modeling, Accelrys, Inc.), choosing CHARMm22 as a force field. The model depicts the linker segment and the 50-kDa subunit, but not the 8-kDa subunit that could not retrieve any protein structure. Processing of Human Heparanase at Site 1—The human proheparanase sequence spanning the two predicted proteolytic cleavage sites (sites 1 and 2), is presented in Fig. 1. Multiple sequence alignment revealed a high conservation of the two cleavage sites among the mammalian (i.e. human, bovine, mouse, and rat) proheparanases (not shown). Mutations were generated in the sequence spanning the predicted cleavage site 1 (105DPKKESTFEER115) of the full-length ∼65-kDa proheparanase (Fig. 2A). These included double mutations at Glu109 and Ser110 (mutation #1), Lys107 and Lys108 (mutation #2), and Asp105 and Pro106 (mutation #3). Each of these amino acids was replaced by glutamine (Gln). We have also deleted six amino acids (110STFEER115) spanning Ser110 to Arg115 (mutation #4) and 11 amino acids (110STFEERSYWQS120) spanning Ser110 to Ser120 (mutation #5) (Fig. 2A). The mutated Hpa-pcDNAs were transfected into Jar cells devoid of endogenous heparanase protein and enzyme activity (Fig. 2) but possessing the enzymatic machinery for proper processing and activation of the proenzyme. Expression of the wild type and mutants proheparanases, production of the 8- and 50-kDa subunits, and enzyme activity were evaluated by Western blot analysis and heparanase enzyme assay. All mutants exhibited heparanase activity comparable to cells transfected with the full-length wild type enzyme (Fig. 2A), as revealed by release of HS degradation fragments from the ECM substrate. We have previously demonstrated that labeled fragments eluted in fractions 20–35 are degradation products of HS, as they were (i) 5- to 6-fold smaller than intact HS side chains; (ii) resistant to further digestion with papain and chondroitinase ABC; and (iii) susceptible to deamination by nitrous acid (24.Vlodavsky I. Fuks Z. Bar-Ner M. Ariav Y. Schirrmacher V. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2704-2711PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants were all processed into the 8- and 50-kDa subunits, comparable to the wild type heparanase (Fig. 2B). Cells transfected with vector alone (Vo) showed no detectable heparanase activity and protein. Altogether, applying the mutations and deletions described above, we were unable to identify a specific amino acid or sequence context necessary for cleavage at site 1. Glutamine 157 at P1 of Cleavage Site 2 Is Not Required for Processing of Human Proheparanase—Sequence analysis of the N terminus of the 50-kDa subunit isolated from cells and tissues revealed that proheparanase cleavage at site 2 occurs between Gln157 and Lys158 (20.Fairbanks M.B.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15659-15667Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A point mutation was generated at Gln157, the precise predicted site 2 cleavage, by substituting this P1 amino acid to alanine (Q157A, mutation #1). Surprisingly, the proheparanase Q157A mutant showed, upon transfection into Jar cells, enzymatic activity (Fig. 3A) and processing into the 8-kDa (not shown) and 50-kDa (Fig. 3B) subunits, similar to the native 65-kDa proenzyme. This result prompted us to investigate further the requirements and amino acids essential for proper proteolytic cleavage at site 2. Mutagenesis of Conserved Amino Acids in the Flanking Sequence of Cleavage Site 2—We investigated the possibility that proteolysis at site 2 does not occur at the carboxyl side of Gln157 but rather at the N-terminal side of the adjacent Lys158 (Fig. 1). Proteolytic cleavage at the N-terminal side of an amino acid is uncommon. Nevertheless, Nardilysin, for example, cleaves at the amino side of two adjacent lysine residues in a target protein (32.Hospital V. Chesneau V. Balogh A. Joulie C. Seidah N.G. Cohen P. Prat A.

Two adjacent lysines, Lys158 and Lys159, found at cleavage site 2 of the human proheparanase (Fig. 1) were separately substituted to alanine. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, both the K158A and K159A mutants showed heparanase activity (Fig. 4A) and processing into the 8-kDa (not shown) and 50-kDa (Fig. 4B, left) subunits, in a manner indistinguishable from that observed with the native proenzyme.

Recent evidence has shown that the Gαq-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 5 up-regulates phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK1/2. However, signaling mechanisms linking mGluR5 to ERK are poorly understood. In this study, roles of a major serine/threonine PP, PP2A, in this event were evaluated in cultured neurons. We found that the PP1/2A inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A mimicked the effect of the mGluR5 agonists (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine and (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine in facilitating phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and its upstream kinase, MEK1/2, in a PP2A-dependent but not PP1-dependent manner. Co-administration of either inhibitor with an mGluR5 agonist produced additive phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Enzymatic assays showed a basal level of phosphatase activity of PP2A under normal conditions, and activation of mGluR5 selectively inhibited PP2A, but not PP1, activity. In addition, a physical association of the cytoplasmic C terminus of mGluR5 with PP2A was observed, and ligand activation of mGluR5 reduced mGluR5-PP2A binding. Additional mechanistic studies revealed that mGluR5 activation increased tyrosine (Tyr307) phosphorylation of PP2A, which was dependent on activation of a p60c-Src family tyrosine kinase, but not the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase and resulted in dissociation of PP2A from mGluR5 and reduced PP2A activity. Together, we have identified a novel, mGluR5-triggered signaling mechanism involving use- and Src-dependent inactivation of PP2A, which contributes to mGluR5 activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2.

Because these two receptors are predominantly postsynaptic in this region of the brain, they are thought to play an active role in the regulation of cellular activities of striatal neurons (9.Wang J.Q. Mao L. Parelkar N.K. Tang Q. Liu Z. Sarwar S. Choe E.S. Curr. Neuropharmacol. 2003; 1: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar). Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2, a major subclass of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), are densely expressed in striatal neurons and activated through phosphorylation on their Thr202 and Tyr204 sites by mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2 in response to a wide range of extracellular stimuli (10.Nozaki K.

However, at present, signaling mechanisms underlying the mGluR5 regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation are poorly understood, especially in neurons (17.Wang J.Q. Tang Q. Samdani S. Liu Z. Parelkar N.K. Choe E.S. Yang L. Mao L. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 29: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase (PP) 2A is one of the major serine/threonine phosphatases that are highly expressed in striatal neurons (18.Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19.Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). As a multisubunit complex, PP2A consists of a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2A-C) and a 65-kDa structural subunit (PP2A-A) forming a core enzyme, which associates with a variable regulatory subunit (PP2A-B) to constitute a heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzyme (20.Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). As a negative regulator of protein phosphorylation, PP2A plays a key role in the dephosphorylation of various phosphoproteins (receptors, enzymes, neuropeptides, structural proteins, and so forth) related to many fundamental cellular activities. There is evidence showing that ERK1/2 is among the signaling phosphoproteins that are readily dephosphorylated by PP2A in cell lines (21.Zhou B. Wang Z.X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22.Silverstein A.M. Barrow C.A. Davis A.J. Mumby M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that PP2A participates in the regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation via G-protein-coupled receptors, such as group I mGluRs, in neuronal cells. In this study, we therefore examined the possible involvement of PP2A in the group I mGluR-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a well-characterized striatal neuronal culture model. We found that inhibition of PP2A mimicked the effect of the mGluR5 agonists in elevating ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Simultaneous PP2A inhibition and mGluR5 stimulation produced an additive increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, mGluR5 activation resulted in transient and p60c-Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A and dissociation of PP2A from mGluR5, leading to reduced PP2A activity. These results unravel a novel signaling model involving inactivation of PP2A after mGluR5 stimulation. This model substrates a significant component of signaling pathways responsible for mGluR5-sensitive activation of ERK1/2. Primary Rat Striatal Neuronal Cultures—Standardized procedures were employed to prepare primary striatal neuronal cultures from day 18 rat embryos or neonatal 1-day-old rat pups (Charles River, New York, NY) (25.Mao L. Wang J.Q. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26.Yang L. Mao L. Tang Q. Samdani S. Liu Z. Wang J.Q. J.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2741-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Predominant neuronal cells were obtained using the procedures, as evidenced by the fact that >90% of total cells were immunoreactive to the specific marker for neurons (microtubule-associated protein-2a+2b), but not for glia (glial fibrillary acidic protein). Cells were cultured for 15–18 days before use. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates from cultures were sonicated, and protein concentrations were determined. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg/20 μl/lane) were separated on NuPAGE Novex 4–12% gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. The blots were incubated in primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against pERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA; 1:1000), ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling; 1:1000), pMEK1/2(Ser217/Ser221) (Cell Signaling; 1:500), MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling; 1:1000), pRaf-1(Ser338) (Cell Signaling; 1:1000), or Raf-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by a 1-h incubation in goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 1:5000. Immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and captured into Kodak Image Station 2000R. Kaleidoscope-prestained standards (Bio-Rad) were used for protein size determination. The density of immunoblots was measured using Kodak 1D Image Analysis software, and all bands were normalized to percentages of control values. Single and Double Immunofluorescent Labeling—The immunofluorescent labeling on 8-chamber glass slides was performed as described previously (25.Mao L. Wang J.Q. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26.Yang L. Mao L. Tang Q. Samdani S. Liu Z. Wang J.Q. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10846-10857Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min), followed by incubation in 4% normal donkey serum and 1% bovine serum album (20 min) to block nonspecific staining. The cells were treated with primary rabbit anti-pERK1/2 or anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling; 1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then incubated for 1 h with donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:200) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For double labeling, the cells were treated with a mixture of primary antibodies containing rabbit anti-mGluR5 antibodies (1:200; Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) and mouse anti-PP2A (catalytic subunit) antibodies (1:200; Upstate) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then incubated for 1 h with donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate and donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to TRITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at 1:200. The immunofluorescent images were analyzed using confocal microscopy (Nikon C1 laser scanning confocal microscope). Co-immunoprecipitation—Rat striatal cell proteins were prepared under weakly denaturing conditions to permit the interaction of mGluR5 with other intracellular proteins (26.Yang L. Mao L. Tang Q. Samdani S. Liu Z. Wang J.Q. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10846-10857Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, striatal cultures were scraped into a microtube containing ice-cold sample buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) and homogenized by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g (10 min) at 4 °C. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 11,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in sample buffer and solubilized in 1% sodium deoxycholate. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. Insoluble proteins were sedimented at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants were used for co-immunoprecipitation. The mGluR5 or PP2A was then precipitated using rabbit anti-mGluR5 antibodies (Upstate) or mouse antibodies against the catalytic subunit of PP2A (Upstate), respectively, and 50% protein A-agarose/Sepharose bead slurry (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments, a 5-fold (by weight) excess of an immunizing peptide, KSSPKYDTLIIRDYTNSSSSL (mGluR5) or CRGEPHVTRRTPDYFL (PP2A), was preincubated with the respective antibodies before co-immunoprecipitation. The c-Src was precipitated using rabbit anti-c-Src antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were separated on Novex 4–12% gels and probed with rabbit anti-mGluR5 antibodies (Upstate), rabbit anti-c-Src antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or mouse anti-PP2A antibodies (Upstate). To detect tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A catalytic subunit, PP2A catalytic subunits were immunoprecipitated with rabbit PP2A catalytic subunit antibodies (Upstate). PP2A immunoprecipitates were then blotted with rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Upstate). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence were used to detect proteins. Negative controls with antigen pre-absorption were carried out for antibodies used in immunoprecipitation. PP1 and PP2A Phosphatase Activity Assay—The activity was assessed by dephosphorylation of the synthetic PP1/PP2A-specific phosphopeptide (K-R-pT-I-R-R) using a serine/threonine phosphatase assay kit from Upstate (catalogue no. 17-127). Following the manufacturer's instructions, cultures were scraped with 0.3 ml of phosphatase extraction buffer containing 20 mm imidazole-HCl; 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.0; 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and soybean trypsin inhibitor; 1 mm benzamidine; and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were sonicated (10 s) and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were used for phosphatase activity assays. To immunoprecipitate PP1 or PP2A, rabbit antibodies against PP1δ (4 μg) or mouse antibodies against the catalytic subunit of PP2A (4 μg) were added, respectively, to a total of 150 μg/200 μl lysate, followed by addition of 50% protein A-agarose/Sepharose bead slurry (Amersham Biosciences) and incubation for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with PBS, followed by one wash with assay buffer, before the phosphopeptide was added to a final concentration of 0.75 mm for incubation for 10 min at 30 °C. The samples were centrifuged briefly, and 25 μl of sample was transferred into a well of a 96-well microtiter plate. A detection solution containing malachite green (100 μl) was added into each well and incubated for 10–15 min at room temperature for color development. A colorimetric assay was made by reading at 650 nm in a microtiter plate reader. Absorbance values of samples were compared with negative controls containing no enzyme and a freshly prepared phosphate standard. Specific activity was determined as the amount of pciomoles of phosphate released per minute per microgram of protein. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was measured using a double fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide staining procedure (26.Yang L. Mao L. Tang Q. Samdani S. Liu Z. Wang J.Q. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10846-10857Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fluorescein diacetate is membrane-permeable and freely enters intact cells, in which it is hydrolyzed by cytosolic esterase and converted to membrane-impermeable fluorescein with a green fluorescence, exhibited only by live cells. Propidium iodide is non-permeable to live cells but penetrates the membranes of dying/dead cells, showing red fluorescence. Cells were rinsed twice with 1× PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min with 1× PBS (0.5 ml/per well) containing 10 μg/ml fluorescein diacetate (Sigma) and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Cultures were washed once with PBS and examined under fluorescent light microscopy. The total numbers of viable cells stained by green fluorescein and dead cells stained by red propidium iodide were determined by counting cells in five random fields. Positive control was produced by treating cultures with kainic acid (500–1000 μm, 24 h). Drugs and Drug Treatments—(RS)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG), 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrocholoride (MPEP), 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOet), tetrodotoxin, okadaic acid (OA), calyculin A, U0126, and PD98058 were purchased from Tocris Cookson Inc. (Ballwin, MO). Tautomycin, genistein, genistin, PP2, PP3, AG1478, and AG825 were purchased from Calbiochem. Human epidermal growth factor was purchased from Sigma. Cultures were washed with PBS and pre-incubated at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered balanced salt solution consisting of 154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES-KOH or HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, for 60 min. Cells were treated by adding drugs freshly made to the HEPES-buffered balanced salt solution. At the end of drug treatment, the cells were quickly washed with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4; Ca2+-free) and placed immediately on ice. The cell monolayer was rapidly scraped in ice-cold lysis buffer. Drugs were dissolved in 1× PBS with or without Me2SO. Whenever Me2SO was used, PBS containing the same concentration of Me2SO was used as the control vehicle. Statistics—The results are presented as means ± S.E. and were evaluated using a one- or two-way analysis of variance, as appropriate, followed by a Bonferroni (Dunn) comparison of groups using least squares-adjusted means. Probability levels of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Inhibition of PP2A Increases ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—Although PP2A dephosphorylates ERK1/2 in heterologous systems (21.Zhou B.

Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), it is not known whether PP2A could exert the same effect in neurons. We then set out to test whether an inhibitory pathway exists from PP2A to ERK1/2 in our cultured striatal neurons for controlling ERK1/2 phosphorylation. OA was used to selectively inhibit PP2A action on the ERK pathway. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the inhibition of PP2A with OA increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in concentration- and time-dependent manners. At a concentration of 0.1 nm, OA did not alter basal levels of pERK1/2. Starting at a fairly low concentration (1 nm), OA induced a reliable increase in pERK1/2 levels. Greater increases in pERK1/2 were induced by higher concentrations of the inhibitor. No significant changes were seen in cellular levels of ERK1/2 after OA application at all concentrations surveyed. In a time-course study in which OA was applied at 0.5–1 μm for different durations, a rapid and prolonged increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurred with no changes in ERK1/2 levels. Reliable increases in ERK1/2 phosphorylation were seen as early as 2 min after OA application and peaked around 5–10 min after OA application. The increases remained at 30 min and declined at 60 min. A different time-course evaluation was also performed, in which OA (1 μm) was incubated for 5 min, and cultures were then lysed 5, 25, or 60 min after termination of the drug incubation. The data from this study (data not shown) were similar to those obtained by incubating OA at different durations. To define the subcellular distribution of pERK1/2 activated by the PP2A inhibition, immunofluorescent labeling was performed after OA treatment (1 μm, 5 min). A high level of pERK1/2 immunostaining was present within the nucleus, and weak to moderate immunostaining was seen in the cytoplasm and neural processes (Fig. 1C). There was no significant difference in cell viability as detected by the double fluorescein diacetate-propidium iodide staining between control cultures and cultures treated with OA (1 μm, 5 or 60 min). Another commonly used PP2A inhibitor, calyculin A, was also tested for its effects on pERK1/2 and ERK1/2 in the same protocol for OA. Calyculin A at a dose range from 0.1 to 1000 nm (for 2, 5, 10, or 30 min) increased ERK2 phosphorylation indistinguishable from that seen after OA application (Fig. 2A). Calyculin A (0.1–1000 nm, 10 min) had no effects on ERK1/2 levels (data not shown). In contrast, tautomycin, an inhibitor relatively selective for PP1 (28.Takai A. Tsuboi K. Koyasu M. Isobe M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), did not alter basal levels of pERK2 (Fig. 2A) and ERK1/2 (data not shown) at doses ranging from 10 nm to 3 μm. To test the efficacy and selectivity of the PP1/PP2A inhibitors in this culture system, the PP1 and PP2A activity was assayed in cultures after drug treatments at different concentrations for 10 min. From Fig. 2B, OA and calyculin A at 0.01 μm, a dose that significantly increased pERK1/2 levels, reduced PP2A but not PP1 activity. At 1 μm, the two inhibitors reduced PP1 and, to a greater extent, PP2A activity. In contrast to these two drugs, tautomycin at 1 μm substantially reduced PP1 activity, sparing PP2A activity. Together, the data obtained above support the existence of a PP2A-sensitive, but not PP1-sensitive, dephosphorylation of pERK1/2 in cultured striatal neurons. OA or calyculin A may change cell firing, which, in turn, could cause a release of an assortment of transmitters and modulators in the culture, leading to activation of receptors and/or kinases other than PP2A to account for the observed changes in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Thus, the effect of OA and calyculin A (1 μm, 10 min) was tested in the presence of a Na+ channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (1 μm, 30 min before OA or calyculin A). We found that the ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by the two drugs was unaffected by tetrodotoxin (data not shown). This suggests that the effect of the two inhibitors was independent of cell firing and transmitter release. The immediate upstream kinase that phosphorylates ERK1/2 is MEK1/2, which is activated through phosphorylation at its serine 217/221 sites by the MEK kinase, i.e. the serine kinase Raf-1 (or c-Raf) (10.Nozaki K. Nishimura M. Hashimoto N. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 23: 1-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Volmat V. Pouyssegur J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12.Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of OA on MEK1/2 phosphorylation and the effect of the MEK1/2-selective inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059) on OA-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. OA produced a concentration-dependent increase in pMEK1/2 without a change in the amount of MEK1/2 proteins (Fig. 2C). These sites of MEK1/2 phosphorylation are involved in kinase activation, indicating that OA produced activation of MEK1/2. The phosphorylation of MEK1/2 induced by OA also corresponded well with the kinetics of OA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a time-course study (data not shown). Pretreatment of cultures with U0126 (10 μm) abolished OA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, without changing basal ERK1/2 levels (Fig. 2D). Similar results were also obtained after application of PD98059 at 100 μm (data not shown). In addition, OA (1 μm, 5 min) increased basal levels of phosphorylated Raf-1, and the elevation of Raf-1 phosphorylation started to decline 1 h after OA application (data not shown). These results support a model in which OA application results in a sequential phosphorylation of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 because they are hierarchically organized as a three-tiered MAPK module. Moreover, the effects of OA on ERK1/2 were probably indirect and mediated by activation of the upstream kinase MEK1/2. Activation of mGluR5 Reduces PP2A Activity—Activation of group I mGluRs with the selective agonist DHPG increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in striatal neurons and other cell lines (13.Schinkmann K.A.

It is likely that DHPG may inhibit basal protein phosphatase activity, which contributes, at least in part, to the elevation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. To investigate this likelihood, effects of DHPG on PP1 and PP2A activity were examined in this study. We found that DHPG concentration-dependently reduced basal levels of PP2A but not PP1 activity (Fig. 3A). At 100 μm, DHPG reduced basal PP2A activity by ∼23% of control (Fig. 3A). The inhibition of PP2A activity induced by 100 μm DHPG appeared to be a rapid and transient event because it became evident at 2 min and peaked at 5 min (Fig. 3B), which corresponds well with the kinetics of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to DHPG stimulation (27.Mao L. Yang L. Tang Q. Samdani S. Arora A. Wang J.Q. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2741-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A series of pharmacological studies were next performed to identify the receptor mechanism mediating the DHPG inhibition of PP2A activity. Pretreatment of cultured neurons with the noncompetitive mGluR5-selective antagonist MPEP at a low concentration (0.2 μm) blocked the DHPG inhibition of PP2A activity (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the noncompetitive mGluR1-selective antagonist CPCCOet at a high concentration (20 μm) did not significantly alter the DHPG effect (Fig. 3C). The mGluR5-selective agonist CHPG at 1–2 mm (5 min) reduced PP2A activity to an extent comparable with that induced by DHPG (100 μm, 5 min), and the CHPG effect was sensitive to MPEP (0.2 μm), but not CPCCOet (20 μm; data not shown). These data suggest that selective activation of mGluR5 rather than mGluR1 mediates the DHPG-sensitive PP2A inhibition. Additionally, because MPEP alone did not affect basal PP2A activity (Fig. 3D), mGluR5 is le"

Although the activation of HSF1 occurs via multiple stress-induced processes such as hyperphosphorylation, the exact cellular mechanism of HSF1 activation is still unclear. Here we show polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and HSF1 interact in vivo using the tandem affinity purification system. Although the interaction between HSF1 and PLK1 is increased by thermal stress, overexpression of PLK1 did not affect HSF1 trimerization or DNA binding activity. This interaction results in the phosphorylation of HSF1 on serine 419 by PLK1. Interestingly, mutation of serine 419 to alanine inhibited heat-stress induced HSF1 nuclear translocation.

One of the most pronounced consequences of heat shock is the unfolding and the misfolding of proteins that ultimately leads to cellular damage. All organisms, from bacteria to human, have evolved a defense mechanism known as the heat shock response, which effectively deals with such cellular stresses (1.Feder M.E. Hofmann G.E. Annu. Rev.

In mammals, the regulation of Hsp expression in response to stress occurs primarily at the transcriptional level and depends on heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). Although HSF1 was identified over 40 years ago, the regulatory mechanisms for HSF1 activity are still unclear (7.Morimoto R.I. Kroeger P.E. Cotto J.J. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B.S. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhauser-Verlag, Basel, Boston, Berlin1996: 139-163Crossref Google Scholar). In normal cells, HSF1 largely localizes to the cytoplasm as an inactive monomer. Upon sensing stress, HSF1 undergoes the transition from a monomeric to a homotrimeric form and translocalizes to the nucleus where it binds DNA. HSF1 binds to the heat shock elements (HSEs), which are inverted repeats of the pentanucleotide motif 5′-nGAAn-3′ found in the promoter region of Hsp genes. Recent studies (8.Kroegere P.E. Sarge K.D.

Polo-like kinases (PLKs) are important regulators of cell cycle progression. In mammalian cells, three PLKs (PLK1, PLK2/Snk, PLK3/Fnk) have been identified (13.Dai W. Wang Q. Traganos F.

The known substrates of PLK1 include several proteins involved in mitosis such as Cdc25C, APC, and cyclin B. PLK1 promotes mitosis through the phosphorylation and activation of Cdc25C, which regulates the tyrosine dephosphorylation of CDKs (16.Kraft C. Herzog F. Gieffers C. Mechtler K. Hagting A. Pines J.

When vertebrate cells enter prophase, phosphorylation of cyclin B1 by PLK1 is essential for its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (19.Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Shinya N.

Elevated levels of PLK1 expression were reported in many different types of cancer cells including promonocytic leukemia and gastric carcinoma (21.Simizu S. Osada H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 852-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22.Takahashi T. Sano B. Nagata T. Kato H. Sugiyama Y. Kunieda K. Kimura M. Okano Y. Suji S.

In this report, we identified PLK1 as a HSF1-interacting protein by utilizing the tandem affinity purification (TAP) system. PLK1 was also shown to phosphorylate HSF1 on serine 419 and regulate its subcellular localization. Our results suggest PLK1 plays an important role in the nuclear translocation of HSF1 induced by heat stress. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids—Vectors for mammalian expression of N-terminally FLAG-tagged mouse HSF1 (amino acids 1–503) and C-terminal-deleted HSF1 (amino acids 1–290) fusion proteins have been described (11.Ahn S-G.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression vectors for recombinant His-tagged or GST-tagged FL HSF1 and C-terminal deleted HSF1 (1–290) fusion proteins have also been described (12.Ahn S-G. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors for C-terminally TAP-tagged FL HSF1 and C-terminal deleted HSF1 (1–290) proteins were created by inserting cDNA fragments into the 5′-KpnI and 3′-NotI sites of pCDNA3.1-TAP. A cDNA fragment containing the complete open reading frame of HSF1 was inserted into the 5′-HindIII and 3′-KpnI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) to create pEGFP-HSF1. A vector for mammalian expression of PLK1 fused to a HA-tag was the generous gift of Dr. D. K. Ferris (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using a PCR-based procedure (24.Michael S.F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 410-412PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. TAP Purification—HEK 293 cells were transfected with pCDNA3.1-HSF1-TAP plasmid to express C-terminally TAP-tagged FL HSF1. HSF1 (FL)-TAP fusion proteins were purified according to the TAP-tagged protein purification procedure (25.Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B.

Briefly, 36 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by sonication. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with IgG-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C in Bio-Rad disposable column. The IgG-Sepharose column was washed with TNP buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) lacking protease inhibitors. TEV cleavage was performed using rTEV protease (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. TEV-cleaved proteins were incubated with calmodulin beads and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed with calmodulin binding buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), bound proteins were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoblotting—HEK 293 cells were transfected with either pCDNA3.1-HSF1-TAP or pCDNA3.1-HA-PLK1 mammalian expression vectors. Forty-eight hours after transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (12.Ahn S-G. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-PLK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HSF1 antibody (Ab2923, Abcam), or anti-actin antibody (C-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In Vitro HSF1 Cross-linking Analysis—For cross-linking experiments, whole cell extracts were prepared by thawing frozen cell pellets in HEG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol containing 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitors). Cells were dispersed by repeated pipetting followed by incubation on ice for 15 min. Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min and supernatants were used for HSF1 trimerization study (20 μgof protein/reaction). EGS (ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate)) cross-linking was carried out as described previously (27.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 28.Liu P.C. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17219-17225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). EGS was added to the final concentrations specified in figure legends and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After quenching the cross-linking reactions with excess 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, samples were resolved by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HSF1 antibody. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from heat shock-treated HEK 293 cells as described previously (27.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Five μg of extract were incubated with 32P-labeled HSE consensus sequence oligonucleotide for 15 min at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm KCl, 50 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1% Tween 20 (v/v)). Following native 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, HSF1-HSE DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro HSF1 Phosphorylation Assay—Recombinant GST-tagged full-length HSF1 and C-terminal deleted HSF1 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene) and purified using glutathione-agarose affinity resin as described (12.Ahn S-G. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Recombinant HSF1 was incubated with 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and immunopurified PLK1 in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (29.Park J. Liu A.Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK 293 cells were seeded on two-chamber slides (21 × 21 mm) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. Cells were cultured overnight and transiently transfected by using FuGENE 6 regent. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After being washed with PBS twice, cells were incubated with methanol for 2 min. For immunostaining, cells were pretreated for 30 min with 5% bovine serum albumin containing PBS as a blocking reagent. Then cells were incubated with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h and washed with PBS for 10 min. Cells were incubated for 30 min with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 2.5% bovine serum albumin containing PBS. Finally, the cells were washed twice for 10 min with PBS and then mounted by using ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) by using the recommended protocol. Fluorescence analysis was performed by conventional fluorescence microscopy. Identification of PLK1 as a HSF1-interacting Protein—Previously, we developed a powerful yeast-based assay system to examine the function and regulatory mechanism of human HSF1 (hHSF1). In this assay system, the expression of hHSF1 did not suppress the lethality of yeast cells lacking endogenous yeast HSF (yhsfΔ) because of an inability of hHSF1 to undergo activation in yeast cells (30.Liu X.D. Liu P.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that activate human HSF1, we transformed yeast expression vectors containing a human cDNA library into the yeast-based assay system and isolated human cDNA encoding PLK1, which was capable of overcoming yeast cell lethality by activating hHSF1 (data not shown). Because PLK1 supported the growth of yhsfΔ cells through hHSF1 activation in yeast, we investigated the role of PLK1 in HSF1 regulation. To confirm the interaction between HSF1 and PLK1, we used the TAP system in mammalian cells. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the TAP-tagged HSF1 mammalian expression vector (pCDNA3.1-HSF1-TAP), and the proteins associated with HSF1 were purified by the two-step affinity purification method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The proteins present in the eluted fraction were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis using antibodies for HSF1 and PLK1 confirmed the interaction between HSF1 and PLK1 (Fig. 1B). Hsp90, a well known interacting partner of HSF1, was also detected. Interaction of PLK1 with HSF1 Is Increased by Heat Stress—To examine the potential role of PLK1 in stress-inducible HSF1 activation, HEK 293 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged PLK1 expression vector (pCDNA3.1-HA-PLK1). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were heat-shocked for 1 h at 42 °C. Cell lysates were prepared from heat-treated (+) or -untreated (–) cells and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-HSF1 antibody or anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A (top panel), heat shock treatment leads to the induction of HSF1 phosphorylation in both control and PLK1-transfected cells. Interestingly, PLK1 overexpression results in an increased HSF1 hyperphosphorylation compared with a heat-stressed control (Fig. 2A, top panel). PLK1 also showed slightly increased phosphorylation under the heat-stressed condition (Fig. 2A, middle panel). To examine whether heat stress affects the interaction between HSF1 and PLK1, HEK 293 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged PLK1 mammalian expression vector for 48 h. Cells were harvested, and the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-HSF1 antibody to detect endogenous HSF1. As shown in Fig. 2B (top panel), interaction of PLK1 with HSF1 was greatly increased after heat shock. PLK1 Is Not Involved in the HSF1 Trimerization or DNA Binding Activity—Under non-stressed conditions, HSF1 is found predominantly as a monomeric polypeptide that lacks specific DNA binding activity. When cells are stressed, HSF1 homotrimerizes, translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, is hyperphosphorylated, acquires DNA binding activity, and becomes transcriptionally competent. The finding that HSF1 interacts with PLK1 raises the possibility that PLK1 may regulate the activation of HSF1. To examine whether PLK1 can modulate HSF1 trimerization in mammalian cells, a cross-linking experiment was performed using whole cell extracts prepared from HEK 293 cells transfected with the HA-tagged PLK1 expression vector. As shown in Fig. 3A, overexpression of PLK1 slightly increased HSF1 trimerization in heat shock-untreated cells, but not significantly. Furthermore, PLK1 did not increase HSF1 trimerization in the heat shock-treated condition compared with an empty vector-transfected control. We next examined the potential role of PLK1 in stress-inducible HSF1 DNA binding activity. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged PLK1 expression vector, and the DNA binding activity of HSF1 was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 3B, heat shock leads to the induction of HSF1 DNA binding activity in both empty vector- and PLK1 expression vector-transfected cells. However, PLK1 overexpression did not increase HSF1 DNA binding activity compared with empty vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that although PLK1 interacts with HSF1 and this interaction is increased by heat stress, PLK1 modulates neither the HSF1 trimerization nor the DNA binding activity under heat stress. PLK1 Phosphorylates HSF1 on Serine 419—Several protein kinases such as CaMKII, GSK-3, ERK, and JNK were reported to phosphorylate HSF1 (31.Holmberg C.I. Tran S.E. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L.

Phosphorylation of Ser-303, Ser-307, and Ser-363 by GSK-3, ERK, and JNK was reported to repress the transcriptional activity of HSF1 (29.Park J. Liu A.Y. J. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18210-18218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser-230 by CaMKII promotes the transcriptional activity of HSF1 (32.Holmberg C.I. Hietakangas V. Mikhailov A. Rantanen J.O. Kallio M. Meinander A. Hellman J. Morrice N. MacKintosh C. Morimoto R.I. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3800-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that several kinases phosphorylate specific residues of HSF1 in response to distinct stimuli and phosphorylation of HSF1 is a crucial regulatory mechanism. To examine whether PLK1 can modulate HSF1 phosphorylation, we next investigated the phosphorylation of HSF1 by PLK1. For the HSF1 phosphorylation assay, recombinant GST-tagged FL HSF1 and C-terminal-deleted HSF1 (1–290) were purified from bacteria. Recombinant HSF1 was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and immunopurified PLK1 from HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, PLK1 specifically phosphorylated FL HSF1, whereas PLK1 did not phosphorylate C-terminal-deleted HSF1 (1–290). Empty vector control reactions did not phosphorylate HSF1. This result demonstrates that PLK1 phosphorylates the C-terminal HSF1 activation domain. Unlike the in vivo results seen in Fig. 2A, phosphorylation of recombinant HSF1 (FL) was not increased by heat shock in vitro (Fig. 4A). This result may be caused by the lack of cellular factors, which regulate HSF1 phosphorylation within the cell. To identify the specific serine residues in the C-terminal region of HSF1 phosphorylated by PLK1, we created HSF1 point mutants containing alanine residue substitutions and analyzed the phosphorylation by PLK1. We chose the Ser-292, Ser-314, Ser-319, Ser-326, and Ser-419 residues as candidate PLK1 phosphorylation sites based on the reported phosphorylation sites of HSF1 (31.Holmberg C.I. Tran S.E. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-tagged HSF1 point mutants (S292A, S314A, S319A, S326A, and S419A) were purified from bacteria and used as a substrate for PLK1 in kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 4B (top panel), the S292A, S314A, S319A, and S326A point mutants showed slightly decreased phosphorylation, whereas the S419A point mutant showed dramatically impaired phosphorylation when compared with wild type HSF1 (FL). These data suggest that the Ser-419 residue of HSF1 is the major and most critical PLK1 phosphorylation site. HSF1 (1–290) was used as a negative control (Fig. 4B, top panel). Coomassie Blue staining showed the equivalent level of purified proteins (Fig. 4B, middle panel). Immunopurified HA-tagged PLK1 proteins used for kinase assays were confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). HSF1 Serine 419 Plays an Important Role in Its Nuclear Translocation—Previous studies showed that PLK1 is involved in the regulation of multiple aspects of the cell cycle and mitosis. PLK1 is localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm during the S and G2 phases and nuclear-localized before mitosis. Interestingly, nuclear import of cyclin B1 and Cdc25C is regulated through phosphorylation by PLK1 (17.Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 18.Lin C.Y. Madsen M.L. Yarm F.R. Jang Y.J. Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2001; 410: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In our results, PLK1 did not affect HSF1 trimerization and DNA binding activity, although the HSF1 and PLK1 interaction is increased by thermal stress (Figs. 2 and 3). Because nuclear translocation of HSF1 is an important regulatory step for its activation, we analyzed whether the phosphorylation of Ser-419 by PLK1 has an affect on the subcellular localization of HSF1. For this experiment, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with a FLAG-tagged HSF1 expression vector (wild type, S292A, S326A, or S419A) and the HA-tagged PLK1 expression vector. To assess the distribution of HSF1, proteins were fractionated, and Western blot analysis was performed before and after exposure to heat shock. Under the normal condition, wild type HSF1 and its point mutants (S292A, S326A or S419A) were found predominantly in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 5, A, top panel, and C). Upon heat shock, wild type HSF1, HSF1 (S292A), and HSF1 (S326A) mutants showed an increased localization in the nucleus (Fig. 5, B, top panel, and D). In contrast, the HSF1 (S419A) mutant remained predominantly in the cytosolic fraction after heat shock, which suggests phosphorylation on Ser-419 by PLK1 plays an essential role in the HSF1 nuclear translocation by heat stress (Fig. 5, B, top panel, and D). PLK1 was predominantly found in the cytosolic fraction, and this localization was not affected by heat stress (Fig. 5, A and B, middle). c-Fos localization was used as a positive control for the nucleic fraction (Fig. 5, A and B, bottom). To confirm the effect of PLK1 on HSF1 nuclear translocation, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with GFP-tagged HSF1 expression vectors (wild type, S292A, or S419A mutant) and the HA-tagged PLK1 expression vector. Forty-eight hours after transfection, indirect immunofluorescent analysis was performed. Under the normal condition, each of the HSF1 derivatives were diffusely localized in cells (Fig. 6). In response to heat shock, wild type HSF1 and the HSF1 (S292A) mutant translocated to the nucleus. In contrast, the HSF1 (S419A) mutant showed a diffuse staining pattern throughout the whole cell, indicating that the phosphorylation of residue Ser-419 by PLK1 is important for HSF1 nuclear translocation (Fig. 6). Under the normal condition, PLK1 localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus, and this diffused staining pattern did not change upon heat stress (data not shown). In this study, we showed evidence that PLK1 interacts with HSF1 in vivo. PLK1 slightly interacts with HSF1 under the normal condition and their interaction was increased by heat stress. Phosphorylation studies demonstrated that PLK1 phosphorylates HSF1 on Ser-419, suggesting a potential role of PLK1 in HSF1 regulation. Furthermore, the mutagenesis study demonstrated that the phosphorylation of Ser-419 residue is important for HSF1 nuclear translocation. Recently, several reports showed that the PLK family has been implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage. For example, PLK3 appears to be activated when cells are exposed to oxidative stress (36.Xie S. Wang Q. Wu H. Cogswell J. Lu L. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36194-36199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PLK1 and PLK3 also participate in pathways that respond to genotoxic and non-genotoxic stress (37.Lee M. Daniels M.J. Venkitaraman A.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38.Bahassi el M. Conn C.W. Myer D.L. Hennigan R.F. McGowan C.H. Sanchez Y. Stambrook P.J.

Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These findings support the notion that PLKs play an important role in stress response pathways. Although the mechanism for PLK1 in stress response is unclear, PLK3 is directly phosphorylated and activated by stress incurred by DNA damage, suggesting that the PLKs are stress-responsive proteins (38.Bahassi el M. Conn C.W. Myer D.L. Hennigan R.F. McGowan C.H. Sanchez Y. Stambrook P.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6633-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Additional biochemical and cellular studies are required to elucidate the function of PLK1 as a regulator of HSF1 activity in response to heat shock. We thank Dr. D. K.

To ease studies of the importance of higher InsPs for cell proliferation or other cellular functions in vivo, one possible approach is to block their biosynthesis by pharmacological inhibition of IP3K isoforms and IPMK. Other approaches are knock-out or RNAi experiments shutting down enzymes generating Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 or higher InsPs. An individual knock-out of IP3K-A in mice resulted in a very weak CNS phenotype in the former case (34.Jun K.S. Choi G. Yang S.-G. Kim D. Kang N.-G. Choi K.Y. Storm D.R. Albert C. Mayr G.W. Lee C.-J. Shin H.-S. Learning Memory. 1998; 5: 317-330PubMed Google Scholar). IP3K-B knockout revealed an essential role of the enzyme or its products for T-cell immunity (35.Pouillon V. Hascakova-Bartova R. Pajak B. Adam E. Bex F. Dewaste V. Van Lint C. Leo O. Erneux C. Schurmans S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). That deletion of the broadly expressed IP3K-B did not generate further phenotypes may be caused by rescue phenomena based on the fact that a total of four enzymes are able to convert Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. These considerations led us to start a search for pharmacological IP3K and IPMK inhibitors. We first examined herbal and synthetic compounds belonging to the flavonoids, anthraquinones, coumarins, triphenylmethanes, tyrphostins, perylenequinones, and staurosporine derivatives for their ability to inhibit a catalytic domain of avian IP3K-A. This enzyme form, when expressed in bacteria, exhibits Vmax and Km values indiscernible from those of enzyme purified from native tissue (36.Bertsch U. Haefs M. Möller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and recent crystal structures of the catalytic domain of IP3K-A have revealed intact folding (37.Gonzalez B. Schell M.J.

The most potent inhibitors found by this prescreen were analyzed in detail for their mechanism of enzyme inhibition of avian IP3K-A and subsequently tested for their inhibitory effect on all three recombinant mammalian IP3K isoforms and human IPMK. Selectivity profiles derived from inhibitors identified here indeed provide promising lead structures for both broad spectrum and isoform specific inhibitors. The intriguing finding that all inhibitors identified in our search have reported antiproliferative effects suggests a correlation between cell growth and IP3K and/or IPMK action.

Open table in a new tab IP3K and IPMK Enzyme Inhibition Assay—The inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 3–10 mm under light exclusion and stored at –20 °C. Prior to use, aliquots were diluted to concentrations of 0.05–1 mm in Me2SO. The enzyme activities of IP3K isoforms and HsIPMK were measured by an optical assay coupling ADP formation to NADH consumption via pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase reactions and using a wavelength of 339 nm. IP3K assays were routinely performed without Ca2+-CaM. The final assay mixture was: 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm ATP, 5 units/ml l-lactate dehydrogenase, 2.5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, pH 7.5. The final volume of the assay was 800 μl. GgIP3K-A, HsIP3K-A, HsIP3K-B, RnIP3K-C, or IPMK were added to the mixture (preincubated at 30 °C for 10 min) to a final concentration of between 3 and 20 nm. The mixture was further incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. After determining the low basal rate of ATP consumption without InsP3 (due to coupling enzyme contamination with ATPase), maximal enzyme activity was measured by adding 25 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3. The enzyme concentration was adjusted so that the activity persisted at Vmax for >5 min. Potential inhibitors were added stepwise in this period in 1–5-μl volumes until maximum inhibition or a concentration of 100 μm was reached. The final concentration of Me2SO was kept below 3% (v/v). This concentration did not affect IP3K or IPMK activity. To preclude time dependent irreversible effects and a potential photodecomposition of inhibitors, multiple assays with varying initial concentrations of inhibitors were also performed. Assay for the Influence of Inhibitors on the Km for ATP—Measurements were carried out with GgIP3K-A as described above with the concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 kept at 25 μm (saturation); the concentration of inhibitor was varied as well as the initial concentration of ATP, the latter of which was changed from 25 to 800 μm. Assay for the Influence of Inhibitors on the Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3— Measurements were carried out with GgIP3K-A as described above with the concentration of ATP kept constant at 500 μm (close to saturation); that of Ins(1,4,5)P3 was varied between 10 μm and <0.1 μm by means of single transient recordings (40.Gutfreund, H., (1971) Enzymes: Physical Principles, Wiley and Sons Ltd., LondonGoogle Scholar). In the range of apparent half-maximal substrate concentration (about 1 μm), 9 μm of the product, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, was present, acting as a competitive type of product inhibitor. Although the derived Km′ values thus were higher than the true Km (∼0.1 μm), the assay was adequate to rapidly analyze influence of inhibitors on the Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3. Test of Influence of Inhibitors on Coupling Enzymes—The standard reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence and absence of inhibitor but without adding IP3K. Subsequently, ADP was added to a final concentration of 10 μm and the observed rapid consumption of NADH was recorded. In no case was any of the coupling assays detectably inhibited by the tested inhibitors or by their solvent. Reversal of Enzyme Inhibition by Addition of Triton X-100 and Ca2+-CaM—The standard reaction mixture was preincubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and enzyme inhibition was brought about with inhibitor concentrations up to 5-fold above IC50. After 5 or 20 min, neutral CaCl2 (final concentration 50 μm) and CaM (final concentration 4 μm), or Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.2%) were added from concentrated stock solutions of 1 mm, 100 μm, and 10% (w/v), respectively, and the reaction was followed for another 5 min. Test of Enzyme Aggregation—IP3K and IPMK inhibition assays with ATA were performed according to the standard conditions but IC50 values were derived for low (3 nm GgIP3K-A or 9 nm IPMK) and high (9 nm GgIP3K-A or 27 nm IPMK) enzyme concentrations. Assay for an Activating or Inactivating Influence of Photometer Light on Photosensitive Inhibitors—For each compound, four reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min under irradiation with photometer light (λ = 339 nm), two in the presence and two in the absence of a concentration of inhibitor about 3-fold above its IC50. In each pair of mixtures, one only contained Ins(1,4,5)P3 while the other only contained ATP. After pre-illumination, the assay was started either with 500 μm ATP or 25 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3, respectively. In the pair of reaction mixtures still lacking inhibitor the latter was supplemented together with the second substrate employed to start the reaction. Test of Covalent Inhibitor Binding by MALDI-Re-TOF MS— GgIP3K-A (final concentration 15 μm) was mixed with inhibitors (ATA or THF; final concentration 30 μm). These mixtures were incubated (buffer: 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 mm NaCl) for 20 min and diluted 1:50 with H2O. After another 20 min of incubation, 1 μl of this sample was applied onto the MALDI target and allowed to air-dry. Once dry, 1 μl of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (matrix) in acetonitrile/water (1:1 with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) was pipetted directly onto the sample surface. The solvent was allowed to evaporate and MALDI-Re-TOF MS analysis was performed using the Bruker reflex IV system. Mass spectra (arbitrary intensity versus m/z data, z = 1) were numerically smoothed, baseline subtracted, and submitted to a peak analysis employing the program Peak Fit 4.11 (SPSS Inc). For baseline subtraction, the best D2 function at a tolerance level of 4.5% was employed, smoothing was by the Fast Fourier Transform method with a smoothing factor of 12.5%, and fitting of peaks (maxima, widths, and areas) was by the residuals method employing spectroscopy type peak functions of the Voigt type with area-based optimization at an amplitude threshold of 4.5%. Test on Topoisomerase II Inhibition—Inhibition of Topo II was assayed by the Topoisomerase II Drug Screening Kit obtained by Topo-GEN. Activity was visualized by the change of linking number in superhelical plasmid DNA. Assays (20 μl) containing 0.25 μg of plasmid DNA and 0.05 to 50 μm inhibitor in 20 μl of 120 mm KCl, 10 mm, MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (final concentrations) preincubated at 37 °C in the dark were started by adding 4 units of Topo II. Me2SO, the solvent of inhibitor stocks, was ≤ 1% (v/v) in the assay, which had no effect on Topo II activity. After 30 min at 37 °C in the dark, the reaction was stopped and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA was done according to the manufacturer's suggestion. Screening for Inhibitors—On the basis of published inhibitors of PI3K, phosphodiesterases, and protein kinases (41.Matter W.F. Brown R.F. Vlahos C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W1999031485,"The yeast SAS2 (Something About Silencing 2) gene encodes a member of the MYST protein family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and is involved in transcriptional silencing at all silent loci (HML, HMR, telomeres, and rDNA) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sas2 is the catalytic subunit of a yeast histone acetyltransferase complex termed SAS complex. The enzymatic activity of SAS complex on free histones has been reported, but nucleosomal HAT activity has not yet been documented. Here we show that the native yeast SAS complex is a small trimeric protein complex composed solely of Sas2, Sas4, and Sas5 with a molecular mass of about 125 kDa. It is capable of acetylating both free histones and nucleosomes, although the nucleosomal HAT activity of SAS complex is very weak when compared with that of NuA4, the other member of MYST HAT complex. We also demonstrate that the putative acetyl CoA binding motif in Sas2 is essential for both the in vivo silencing function and the enzymatic activity of SAS complex. Unlike NuA4, which acetylates all four available lysines at the N-terminal tail of histone H4, SAS complex exclusively acetylates lysine 16 of histone H4 in vitro and is required for the bulk of H4 lysine 16 acetylation in vivo. This specific lysine preference corresponds to the role of SAS complex in antagonizing the spreading of Sir proteins at silent loci in S. cerevisiae."

In our current understanding, there is no endogenous glucose production in the brain, and it is totally dependent upon blood glucose. This glucose is generated between meals by the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) in the liver and the kidney. Recently, we reported a ubiquitously expressed Glc-6-P hydrolase, glucose-6-phosphatase-β (Glc-6-Pase-β), that can couple with the Glc-6-P transporter to hydrolyze Glc-6-P to glucose in the terminal stages of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

The liver and the kidney are the primary organs responsible for interprandial blood glucose homeostasis.

Alone, neither Glc-6-PT nor Glc-6-Pase-α have significant microsomal Glc-6-P transport activity, but when co-expressed they couple to significantly increase the activity of the Glc-6-Pase·Glc-6-PT complex (3Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Glc-6-Pase-β also has the ability to couple functionally with Glc-6-PT (14Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

The discovery of Glc-6-Pase-β implies that non-hepatic tissues may be capable of endogenous glucose production through the activity of a Glc-6-Pase-β·Glc-6-PT complex. This is of particular interest, because the liver and kidney are not the sole sites of glycogen storage in the body. Indeed, the muscle is the major reservoir of body glycogen (21Baynes J. Dominiczak M.H. Baynes J. Medical Biochemistry. Mosby, London1999: 139-155Google Scholar, 22Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Glc-6-Pase-β (12Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), also stores glycogen. Moreover, glucose export from the brain has been demonstrated in children undergoing elective cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for congenital heart disease (23Eyre J.A. Stuart A.G. Forsyth R.J. Heaviside D. Bartlett K. Brain Res. 1994; 635: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that the brain may be capable of endogenous glucose production. In the brain, the primary sites of glycogen storage are the astrocytes. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system, responsible for regulating the external neuronal environment, responding to injury, and modulating neuronal growth and maturation (reviewed in Refs. 24Gruetter R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and 25Brown A.M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). An acid-labile Glc-6-Pase-like activity (26Forsyth R.J. Bartlett K. Burchell A. Scott H.M. Eyre J.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) has been reported in astrocytes. However, the role of astrocyte glycogen in glucose production is controversial because the presence of a functional Glc-6-Pase complex has never been demonstrated in the brain. In this study, we show that brain astrocytes possess an active Glc-6-Pase-β·Glc-6-PT complex that can hydrolyze Glc-6-P to glucose, suggesting that astrocyte glycogen can be converted to glucose and may be a source of alternative energy in the neurons. Construction of Recombinant Adenoviral Mouse Glc-6-Pase-β— Mouse Glc-6-Pase-β (mGlc-6-Pase-β) containing a C-terminal FLAG peptide, DYKDDDDK (pSVL-mGlc-6-Pase-β-FLAG), was constructed by PCR from the pSVL-mGlc-6-Pase-β template (22Shieh J.-J.

Recombinant adenoviruses containing mGlc-6-Pase-β (Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β) or mGlc-6-Pase-β-FLAG (Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β-FLAG) were generated by the Cre-lox recombination system (27Hardy S. Kitamura M.

The recombinant virus was plaque purified and amplified to produce viral stocks with titers of ∼5–10 × 109 plaque-forming units (pfu) per milliliter. Recombinant adenoviruses containing human Glc-6-Pase-β (Ad-hGlc-6-Pase-β), human Glc-6-Pase-α (Ad-hGlc-6-Pase-α), and human Glc-6-PT (Ad-hGlc-6-PT) have been described (14Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J.

Expression in COS-1 Cells—COS-1 cells in 150-cm2 flasks were grown at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum. The cells were infected with Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β or Ad-hGlc-6-Pase-α at various pfu/cell values and, after incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, either cell lysates or microsomes isolated from lysates were used for phosphohydrolase assays and Western blot analyses. For Glc-6-PT expression, COS-1 cells were infected with 50 pfu/cell Ad-hGlc-6-PT. For co-expression of Glc-6-PT and Glc-6-Pase, COS-1 cells were co-infected with 25 pfu/cell Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β or Ad-hGlc-6-Pase-β and 50 pfu/cell Ad-hGlc-6-PT. For Glc-6-P uptake analysis, microsomes were isolated from lysates prepared after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. Phosphohydrolase and Glc-6-P Uptake Analyses—Phosphohydrolase activity was determined essentially as described previously (14Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Glc-6-Pase-β in brain microsomes was assayed at the optimal temperature of 37 °C, and Glc-6-Pase-α in hepatic microsomes was assayed at 30 °C (14Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm Glc-6-P, and appropriate amounts of microsomal preparations were incubated at either 37 or 30 °C for 10 min. Disrupted microsomal membranes were prepared by incubating intact microsomes in 0.2% deoxycholate for 20 min at 0 °C. Nonspecific phosphatase activity was estimated by pre-incubating disrupted microsomal preparations at pH 5, for 10 min at 37 °C to inactivate the acid-labile Glc-6-Pase-α and Glc-6-Pase-β. Glc-6-P uptake measurements were performed as described (3Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

Briefly, microsomes (40 μg) were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 250 mm sucrose, and 0.2 mm [U-14C]Glc-6-P (50 μCi/μmol). The reaction was stopped at the appropriate time by filtering immediately through a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85; Schleicher & Schuell) and washing with an ice-cold solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose. The radioactivity measured within the microsomes represents both the translocated substrate, [U-14C] Glc-6-P, and its hydrolytic product, [U-14C]glucose. Microsomes permeabilized with 0.2% deoxycholate to abolish Glc-6-P uptake were used as negative controls. Two to three independent experiments were conducted, and at least three Glc-6-P uptake studies were performed for each microsomal preparation. Statistical analysis using the unpaired t test was performed with the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Glc-6-Pase-α–/– and Glc-6-PT–/– Mice—Mice deficient in Glc-6-Pase-α (28Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat.

All animal studies were conducted under an animal protocol approved by the NICHD Animal Care and Use Committee. To maintain viability of the Glc-6-Pase-α–/– and Glc-6-PT–/– mice, glucose therapy consisting of intraperitoneal injection of 25–100 μl of 15% glucose every 12 h was initiated on the first post-natal day (29Chen L.-Y. Shieh J.-J. Lin B. Pan C.-J. Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. Roe T.F. Moses S. Ward J.M. Westphal H. Lee E.J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. Hum. Mol.

Microsomes were isolated from the brain and liver of 6 –7-week-old mice essentially as described (8Shelly L.L. Lei K.-J. Pan C.-J. Sakata S.F. Ruppert S. Schutz G. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

Each microsomal preparation represents one individual mouse, and at least three independent microsomal preparations were used for each assay. Northern Blot and Western Blot Analyses—Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate/cesium chloride method, fractionated by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, and transferred to a Nytran membrane by electroblotting. The filters were hybridized to a uniformly labeled mGlc-6-Pase-β, mGlc-6-PT, or β-actin riboprobe. For Western blot analysis, cell lysates or microsomal proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Co.). The membranes were incubated either with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak), a polyclonal antibody against hGlc-6-Pase-β (22Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

The antigen-antibody complex was visualized as described previously (14Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

(31Pousset F. Cremona S. Dantzer R. Kelley K. Parnet P. Glia. 1999; 26: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were dissected from 2–3-day-old wild-type, Glc-6-Pase-α–/–, or Glc-6-PT–/– pups, and the meningeal tissues were removed. The cortices were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and flushed several times with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The resulting cell suspension was passed through a sterile nylon sieve (70-μm pore size; Falcon) to remove clumps and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min to collect the cells. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, seeded at a density of 9 × 104 cells/6-cm dishes, and then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Under these conditions, neurons do not survive the mechanical dissociation, and the low plating density prevents oligodendrocyte proliferation (31Pousset F. Cremona S. Dantzer R. Kelley K. Parnet P. Glia. 1999; 26: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After 7 days in culture, the cells were incubated with fresh Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and this medium was changed weekly. After 21 days in culture, one set of cultures was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde to stain for marker proteins. The second set of cultures was used to prepare cell lysates and microsomes for phosphohydrolase and Glc-6-P uptake assays and Western blot analyses. The purity of the astrocytes was determined by staining for GFAP (32Rutka J.T. Murakami M. Dirks P.B. Hubbard S.L. Becker L.E. Fukuyama K. Jung S. Tsugu A. Matsuzawa K. J. Neurosurg. 1997; 87: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated for 30 min at room temperature in TST buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton-X-100) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10% horse serum (TST-BSA), and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-GFAP antibody at 4 μg/ml in TST-BSA. Following three washes with TST buffer, the cells were then incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min, and the antigen-antibody complex was visualized with the Vectastatin Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Replicates omitting the primary antibody or substituting the primary antibody with a preimmune rabbit serum were used as controls. A mouse monoclonal antibody against fibronectin (Sigma) and a rat monoclonal antibody against myelin basic protein (Sigma) were used to measure contamination of the cultures by fibroblasts and oligodendrocytes, respectively. Mouse Glc-6-Pase-β Is a Phosphohydrolase and Couples with Glc-6-PT to Form a Functional Glc-6-Pase Complex—The hGlc-6-Pase-β is a functional phosphohydrolase (13Guionie O. Clottes E. Stafford K.

To investigate whether mGlc-6-Pase-β might have a level of activity below the sensitivity of the reported assay, we examined the Glc-6-P hydrolytic activity of mGlc-6-Pase-β using a sensitive adenovirus-based expression system. Viral stocks of Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β, Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β-3FLAG, Ad-hGlc-6-Pase-β (or Ad-hGlc-6-Pase-β-3FLAG) (14Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

The Ad-hGlc-6-Pase-α-3FLAG-infected COS-1 lysates yield activities of 208.2 ± 7.9 and 347.6 ± 9.9 nmol/mg/min at a multiplicity of infection of 25 and 50 pfu/cell, respectively (Fig. 1A). The Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β-3FLAG-infected COS-1 lysates have a lower but significant activity, showing a dose-dependent Glc-6-P hydrolytic activity that ranges from 11.8 ± 0.3 nmol/mg/min at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu/cell to 82.4 ± 5.1 nmol/mg/min at multiplicity of infection of 100 pfu/cell (Fig. 1A). In the same assay, the non-tagged protein Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β has an activity identical to that of the tagged protein Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β-3FLAG (data not shown). The mGlc-6-Pase-β activity is similar to the hGlc-6-Pase-β activity (14Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Western analysis shows that the expression of mGlc-6-Pase-β and hGlc-6-Pase-α proteins correlates with enzymatic activity (Fig. 1A), as was shown previously for hGlc-6-Pase-β (14Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that both hGlc-6-Pase-α and hGlc-6-Pase-β are acid-labile and latent (14Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The mGlc-6-Pase-β is similarly acid-labile, losing >98% of Glc-6-P hydrolytic activity when Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β-infected COS-1 microsomes are incubated at pH 5.0 for 10 min at 37 °C (Fig. 1B). The mGlc-6-Pase-β also exhibits a similar latency to that of hGlc-6-Pase-α and hGlc-6-Pase-β (Fig. 1B). Both human Glc-6-Pases also share a common pH optimum of 6.5, although the optimal temperatures for hGlc-6-Pase-α and hGlc-6-Pase-β differ, being 30 and 37 °C, respectively (14Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Like hGlc-6-Pase-β, the optimal assay condition for mGlc-6-Pase-β is pH 6.5 and 37 °C (Fig. 1B). In the liver and kidney, Glc-6-P transport and hydrolysis are tightly coupled (28Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The uptake and accumulation of Glc-6-P into the lumen of the ER is stimulated dramatically when hGlc-6-PT is co-expressed with either hGlc-6-Pase-α or hGlc-6-Pase-β (3Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B.

COS-1 cells infected with Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β (or Ad-hGlc-6-Pase-β) have a very low level of microsomal Glc-6-P uptake activity (Fig. 1C), as was shown previously for hGlc-6-Pase-α (3Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Microsomal Glc-6-P transport activity was significantly increased in COS-1 cells infected with Ad-hGlc-6-PT alone (Fig. 1C), and the activity was markedly increased in cells co-infected with either Ad-hGlc-6-PT and Ad-mGlc-6-Pase-β or Ad-hGlc-6-PT and Ad-hGlc-6-Pase-β (Fig. 1C). The co-infected cultures also have identical time courses for microsomal Glc-6-P accumulation.

https://openalex.org/W2063639626,"Biallelic mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene are linked to schwannoma and meningioma tumorigenesis. Cells with NF2 mutations exhibit elevated levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and aberrant cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. The NF2 gene product, merlin, associates with adherens junction protein complexes, suggesting that part of its function as a tumor suppressor involves regulating cell junctions. Here, we find that a novel PDZ protein, called erbin, binds directly to the merlin-binding partner, EBP0, and regulates adherens junction dissociation through a MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Reducing erbin expression using a targeted siRNA in primary cultures of Schwann cells results in altered cell-cell interactions, disruption of E-cadherin adherens junctions, increased cell proliferation, and elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK, all phenotypes observed in cells that lack merlin. Reduction of erbin expression also results in the dissociation of merlin from adherens junction proteins and an increase in the levels of phosphorylated merlin. These phenotypes can be rescued if cells with reduced levels of erbin are treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of ERK kinase. Collectively, these data indicate that erbin regulates MAP kinase activation in Schwann cells and suggest that erbin links merlin to both adherens junction protein complexes and the MAP kinase signaling pathway.

Here, we find that a novel PDZ protein, called erbin, binds directly to the merlin-binding partner, EBP0, and regulates adherens junction dissociation through a MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Reducing erbin expression using a targeted siRNA in primary cultures of Schwann cells results in altered cell-cell interactions, disruption of E-cadherin adherens junctions, increased cell proliferation, and elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK, all phenotypes observed in cells that lack merlin. Reduction of erbin expression also results in the dissociation of merlin from adherens junction proteins and an increase in the levels of phosphorylated merlin. These phenotypes can be rescued if cells with reduced levels of erbin are treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of ERK kinase. Collectively, these data indicate that erbin regulates MAP kinase activation in Schwann cells and suggest that erbin links merlin to both adherens junction protein complexes and the MAP kinase signaling pathway.

Although mice that are Nf2-null die at early embryonic stages, heterozygotes are viable and develop metastatic disease (7McClatchey A.I. Saotome I. Ramesh V. Gusella J.F. Jacks T.

Mice with Schwann cell-targeted expression of mutant merlin proteins or biallelic loss of Nf2, however, develop schwannomas that resemble the tumors seen in NF2 patients (9Giovannini M.

Collectively, these data indicate that Nf2 functions as a tumor suppressor gene.The mechanism by which the Nf2 gene product, merlin (also called schwannomin), regulates cell growth is not well understood. Merlin is a member of the band 4.1 superfamily of proteins that link the actin cytoskeleton to transmembrane proteins. Within this family, merlin shares the highest degree of homology with a subgroup of proteins that includes ezrin, radixin, and moesin (“ERM proteins”), which interact with transmembrane proteins, such as the CD44 glycoprotein, through their N-terminal FERM (Four-point-one, ERM) domains (11Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 12Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The FERM domains of ERM proteins and of merlin also interact with a number of intracellular partners, including the C-terminal sequence of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1; also called EBP50), that, through two PDZ (PSD 95/Disc Large/Zona occludens-1) domains, link ERM proteins and merlin to other transmembrane and intracellular proteins (12Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).Merlin also interacts, either directly or indirectly, with a number of proteins that may influence cell growth regulation in Schwann cells and other cells, including paxillin, erbB2, p21-activated kinase, and components of cadherin-mediated cell junctions (13Fernandez-Valle C.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In Nf2-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts, Nf2 deficiency led to piling-up of cells, hyperproliferation, increased ERK phosphorylation, and defective cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions characterized by mislocalization of β-catenin, α-catenin, and N-cadherin (17Lallemand D. Curto M. Saotome I. Giovannini M. McClatchey A.I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These data support a model for merlin function that includes integrating signals that regulate cell proliferation with signals that influence cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions.A protein that could link merlin to both MAP kinase signaling, erbB2, and cadherin-mediated cell junctions is the recently discovered PDZ protein, erbin. Originally described as an erbB2-interacting protein, erbin contains 16 leucine-rich repeats and a single PDZ domain in its C terminus (18Kolch W. Science's STKE. 2003; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/199/pe37)PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this unique composition of domains, erbin is regarded as a member of the LAP (for leucine-rich repeat and PDZ) protein superfamily (19Borg J.P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Erbin has been implicated in regulating cell polarity and in basolateral targeting of its binding partners (20Legouis R. Jaulin-Bastard F. Schott S. Navarro C. Borg J.P. Labouesse M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1096-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain of erbin binds with high affinity to members of the p120-catenin family that are implicated in regulating cadherin turnover, including δ-catenin and ARVCF (armadillo repeat gene deleted in velocardiofacial syndrome) (21Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R. Deshayes K. Koehler M.F. Kosik K.S. Sidhu S.S. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12906-12914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Erbin also interacts with p0071 (also called plakophilin-4), another p120 family member, in cell-cell junctions of epithelial cells (22Jaulin-Bastard F. Arsanto J.P. Le Bivic A. Navarro C. Vely F.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the erbin PDZ domain may associate with β-catenin, it only does so in vitro with very low affinity (21Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R. Deshayes K. Koehler M.F. Kosik K.S. Sidhu S.S. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12906-12914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, erbin inhibits ERK activation through its leucine-rich repeat domain (25Huang Y.Z. Zang M. Xiong W.C. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1108-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This effect appears to depend on indirect interactions between erbin and active, GTP-bound Ras that disrupt the binding of Raf1 to Ras and subsequent activation of ERK.Given that both erbin and merlin associate with proteins constituting adherens junctions as well as erbB2, and that loss of either protein results in increased ERK phosphorylation, we tested the possibility that erbin and merlin interact with one another. We report here that erbin is expressed in myelinated peripheral nerve fibers by Schwann cells and interacts indirectly with merlin and directly with the C terminus of EBP50. Merlin dissociates from adherens junction protein complexes in Schwann cells with reduced erbin expression. This effect can be reversed using a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK, indicating that erbin links merlin to adherens junction protein complexes through a MAP kinase-dependent mechanism.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Schwann cells were isolated from sciatic nerves of 3-day-old rat pups (26Brockes J.P. Fields K.L. Raff M.C. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), purified by anti-Thy 1.1 immunoselection, and expanded for 6-7 passages on 10-cm plates coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 μm forskolin (Sigma), and 5 ng/ml recombinant human HRG-β1 (EGF domain; R&D Systems). For cell growth assays, cells were grown in the absence of added neuregulin to increase the probability of observing either inhibitory or stimulatory effects on cell division and death. All of the cultures used in these experiments were >99% Schwann cells.Antibodies and Reagents—We used the following antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal against erbin (19Borg J.P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar); a polyclonal against EBP50 (generously provided by A. Bretscher); polyclonals against ERK, E-cadherin, cyclin D1, Ki-67, merlin, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); a polyclonal against phosphorylated-Erk (Cell Signaling); monoclonal antibodies against β-catenin and N-cadherin (BD Transduction Laboratories); a monoclonal antibody against CD44 (27Sherman L.S. Rizvi T.A. Karyala S. Ratner N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1071-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); a monoclonal antibody against E-cadherin (BD Pharmingen); a monoclonal antibody against tubulin (NeoMarkers); rabbit IgG, mouse IgG, and goat IgG (Vector Laboratories); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells and tissues were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). U0126 was purchased from Promega.Immunoprecipitations—Total protein extracts were made in 85 mm NaCl, 150 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, supplemented with protease inhibitors as previously described (27Sherman L.S. Rizvi T.A. Karyala S. Ratner N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1071-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Lysates were kept on ice for 15 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Approximately 100 μg of extract was precleared at 4 °C for 30 min with 30 μl of Protein-A- or Protein-A/G (Oncogene Science)-Sepharose beads and 1 μg of isotype-matched IgG. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 2.5 μg of the immunoprecipitating antibody and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The extract was then incubated with 35 μl of either Protein-A or Protein-A/G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Complexes were washed extensively with buffer A (200 mm NaCl, 150 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton-X 100, pH 7.5), buffer B (100 mm NaCl, 150 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton-X 100, pH 7.5), and buffer C (50 mm NaCl, 150 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton-X 100, pH 7.5) then incubated in SDS sample buffer for 10 min at 90 °C. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was carried out using standard protocols.Immunostaining—Schwann cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cultures were then washed extensively with 10% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with the same buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated on the cells for 1 h. The cells were washed three times for 10 min each at room temperature in the blocking buffer and secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3 diluted in blocking buffer were added for 45 min. Cells were washed and coverslips mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). We viewed the cells with a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope.Sciatic nerves were removed from adult mice and immediately placed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. They were then washed extensively in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, teased on Superfrost Plus microscope slides, and dried at room temperature. Following incubation with 10% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature, primary antibodies were diluted in the same blocking buffer and incubated with tissues overnight at 4 °C. Nerves were washed extensively in the blocking buffer then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3 diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h. Following a final set of washes, nerves were mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) and examined using a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope.Inhibition of Erbin Expression by siRNA—The target region of siRNA was 540 nucleotides downstream of the start codon, which contained ∼50% G/C content. The nucleotide sequence was 5′-UAGACUGACCCAGCUGGAA-dTdT-3′ (nucleotides 866-884) as previously described (25Huang Y.Z. Zang M. Xiong W.C. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1108-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We searched the NCBI sequence bank against this segment of DNA using the BLAST program, which confirmed no match to any genes other than erbin, verifying the specificity of the target region by siRNA. The 21-nucleotide RNAs were chemically synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. A scrambled erbin siRNA was also constructed and used as a negative control. To demonstrate the silencing effect of endogenous erbin expression by siRNA, sub-confluent Schwann cell cultures grown in 10-cm dishes were transfected with the siRNA duplex using an amine-based transfection reagent (Ambion). Briefly, 24 μl of transfection reagent was mixed with 665.5 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Following a 15-min incubation at room temperature, 16.3 μl of 20 μm erbin-siRNA duplex was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min. The entire mix was overlaid onto the cells and incubated overnight before the addition of 7 ml of antibiotic free medium. 44 h after transfection the cells were lysed and harvested in the same manner as described for Western blotting and subjected to immunoblotting for expression of erbin.In Vitro Affinity Precipitation Assay—Expression of merlin (fulllength cDNA as previously described (31Morrison H. Sherman L.S. Legg J. Banine F. Isacke C. Haipek C.A. Gutmann D.H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 968-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar)), erbin, and EBP50 recombinant GST fusion proteins was induced in DH5α cells with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h at 37°C. We extracted proteins in phosphate-buffered saline containing DNase, lysozyme (Sigma), and EGTA by sonicating for 45 s and purified them on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Schwann cells were lysed as described for immunoprecipitation. We incubated immobilized GST fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C with 250 μg of lysates and washed them sequentially with immunoprecipitation buffers B, C, and A before immunoblotting analysis.Cell Counts—Cell counts were performed in triplicate. Cells harvested from supernatants or brought into suspension following treatment with trypsin-EDTA were counted in a hemocytometer following staining with Trypan Blue (Sigma). Cells that excluded dye were considered viable. Mean numbers of cells were determined from at least three cultures per condition. Significance was determined using a Student's t test.RESULTSErbin Is Expressed by Schwann Cells in Myelinated Peripheral Nerves—In peripheral nerves, β-catenin is expressed in the outer cytoplasmic loops of Schwann cells, in Schmidt-Lanterman incisures, and flanking axons at the paranodes, with only diffuse expression at the node of Ranvier (28Fannon A.M. Sherman D.L. Ilyina-Gragerova G. Brophy P.J. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Colman D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether erbin localized to the nodes or paranodes of teased sciatic nerve fibers by double-labeling immunohistochemistry with anti-erbin and anti-β-catenin antibodies. Erbin and β-catenin co-localized at incisures and at paranodes in a pattern consistent with expression by Schwann cells at these locations (Fig. 1, A and B). Erbin was also weakly expressed at the abaxonal membrane, especially near incisures (Fig. 1B, arrows, middle panel). To verify that erbin is expressed by Schwann cells, we examined erbin expression in primary Schwann cell cultures derived from neonatal rat sciatic nerves. Erbin was diffusely expressed near the membrane (arrowheads, Fig. 1C) and throughout the cytoplasm (arrow, Fig. 1C, middle panel) of Schwann cells where it partially co-localized with β-catenin.Reducing Erbin Expression Alters Schwann Cell Proliferation and Cell-Cell Interactions—Using a previously described erbin siRNA construct (25Huang Y.Z. Zang M. Xiong W.C. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1108-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) we found that we could reduce erbin expression in primary cultures of Schwann cells by 50-80% as determined by scanning densitometry of Western blots probed with an erbin antibody (Fig. 2A). Neither an empty vector, an irrelevant siRNA (against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; not shown), nor a scrambled erbin siRNA (Fig. 2A, right panel) had any effect on erbin expression. Schwann cells with reduced erbin levels tended to pile up on top of one another, had a more flattened appearance than cells in control cultures, and failed to form typical cell-cell contacts in confluent cultures (Fig. 2, compare B and D with C and E). Consistent with this observation, we found that β-catenin became dissociated from E-cadherin (but not N-cadherin) in erbin siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2, F and G) even though the absolute levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin were unaffected by the reduction of erbin (Fig. 2H).Fig. 2Reducing erbin expression in Schwann cells disrupts cell-cell interactions. A, Western blot (left panel) showing expression of erbin in Schwann cells treated with empty vector (control) or erbin siRNA. 55 h post-transfection, erbin expression was reduced by ∼50% in cultures treated with the erbin siRNA. Transfection with a scrambled erbin siRNA construct (right panel) had no effect on erbin expression levels. Tubulin served as a loading control. In B-E: low (B and C) and high (D and E) power phase contrast photomicrographs of Schwann cell cultures treated for 55 h with (B and D) empty vector and (C and E) erbin siRNA. Note that cells with reduced levels of erbin piled-up on one another and tended to have more spread out morphologies than cells in control cultures. F, Western blot probed for E-cadherin and β-catenin following immunoprecipitation with an E-cadherin antibody. Note that very little β-catenin co-immunoprecipitates with E-cadherin in the presence of the erbin siRNA. G, Western blot showing that the association of β-catenin with N-cadherin is not affected in cells with reduced erbin expression. H, Western blots of total cell lysates from the experiment in F and G, showing that the total expression levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and β-catenin remain unchanged in the presence of erbin siRNA. Actin was used as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Many of the cells that piled-up in the erbin siRNA-treated cultures became detached and floated in the culture dish. By 55 h post-transfection, 40-50% of cells treated with erbin siRNA were floating in the culture dish as compared with control cultures where fewer than 5% of cells were floating. This occurred in cultures grown on both poly-l-lysine and laminin-coated plates (data not shown). We therefore tested if cells became detached due to cell death by performing trypan blue exclusion assays and cell counts on both attached cells and floating cells at 24, 48, and 55 h post-transfection. There were 20-30% more live Schwann cells (determined by counting both attached and detached cells that excluded trypan blue; Fig. 3A) in the erbin siRNA cultures than in the control cultures. Consistent with this observation, we observed a 15-25% increase in the numbers of cells expressing Ki-67 (Fig. 3B) and a dramatic (>4-fold) increase in the expression of cyclin D1 (Fig. 3C), indicating that reduced erbin expression leads to increased Schwann cell proliferation. Reducing erbin expression also caused an increase in the levels of phosphorylated ERK (40-60% above controls, normalized to the levels of total ERK protein).Fig. 3Reduced erbin expression induces Schwann cell proliferation and live cell detachment in vitro. A, both cells floating in the culture media and those that were still attached to the substrate were harvested from empty vector and erbin siRNA-transfected Schwann cell cultures and counted following staining with Trypan Blue at 0, 24, 48, and 55 h post-transfection. There were significantly (*, p < 0.005 using a Student's t test) increased cell numbers in erbin-reduced cultures, indicating increased cellular proliferation. B, in agreement with the cell counts in A, we also observed increased Ki-67 labeling in cultures with reduced levels of erbin. C, Western blots showing increased cyclin D1 and phosphorylated ERK expression in Schwann cell cultures treated with erbin siRNA for 55 h. D, analysis of the cells floating in the culture medium revealed that a far greater number of floating cells were present in the erbin siRNA-transfected cultures as compared with control and that a majority of these cells were still alive at both 48 and 55 h post-transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The majority of the detached cells found in the medium 55 h post-transfection were alive (Fig. 3D). However, 24 h later, nearly all of these cells incorporated trypan blue, suggesting that they died as a result of anoikis (data not shown). To determine if a greater number of the floating cells had incorporated erbin siRNA than those that were still attached, we repeated these experiments using a fluorophore-tagged erbin siRNA construct. Over 90% of the cells, both attached and floating, had taken up the siRNA 24 h post-transfection (data not shown). Moreover, immunocytochemistry revealed that at 50 h post-transfection, erbin expression had been reduced to a similar degree in all the cells that had taken up the siRNA construct (data not shown), thus ruling-out the possibility that the floating cells were for some reason more likely to have taken-up the erbin siRNA at the time of transfection. Together, these data indicate that reducing the levels of erbin in Schwann cells promotes Schwann cell proliferation in conjunction with a disruption of normal cell-cell contacts.The Phenotypes of Schwann Cells with Reduced Levels of Erbin Can Be Reversed with an MEK Inhibitor—Erbin has been implicated in regulating the activation of ERKs by interfering with the binding of Raf-1 to activated Ras (25Huang Y.Z. Zang M. Xiong W.C. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1108-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As shown above, Schwann cells with reduced erbin expression had increased levels of phosphorylated ERK compared with controls (Fig. 3C). To determine if the phenotypes of Schwann cells with reduced erbin expression could be reversed by lowering ERK activation, we tested the effects of a MEK inhibitor, U0126, on Schwann cells treated with erbin siRNA. After 24 h in the presence of 25 μm U0126, ERK phosphorylation was dramatically reduced in cells that had been grown in the presence of erbin siRNA (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, blocking MEK reversed the dissociation of β-catenin from E-cadherin (Fig. 4B), as well as the piling-up phenotype observed in cultures treated with the erbin siRNA alone (Fig. 4, C and D), with many cells (>40%) regaining cell-cell contacts. Increased proliferation and the detachment of live, erbin siRNA-treated cells were also markedly reduced following treatment with U0126 (Fig. 4, E and F). These data indicate that the phenotypes of Schwann cells with reduced levels of erbin depend on increased MAP kinase activity.Fig. 4MEK inhibition rescues the phenotypes induced in Schwann cells by reduced erbin expression. A, the MEK inhibitor, U0126, or Me2SO (DMSO, as a vehicle control) was added to erbin siRNA-transfected cultures ∼30 h prior to harvest (at 55 h post-transfection). Western blot analysis revealed that the inhibitor completely abolished the increase in phosphorylated ERK levels induced by erbin siRNA. B, Schwann cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a β-catenin antibody and immunoblotted for both β-catenin and E-cadherin. Cells treated with the MEK inhibitor maintained β-catenin-E-cadherin protein complexes. Total levels of β-catenin were not affected by the addition of the MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, the MEK inhibitor did not affect β-catenin-E-cadherin interactions in cells transfected with empty vector. C and D, phase-contrast photomicrographs"
https://openalex.org/W2101098292,"The post-translational farnesylation of proteins serves to anchor a subset of intracellular proteins to membranes in eukaryotic organisms and also promotes protein-protein interactions. Inhibition of protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) is lethal to the pathogenic protozoa Plasmodium falciparum. Parasites were isolated that were resistant to BMS-388891, a tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) PFT inhibitor. Resistance was associated with a 12-fold decrease in drug susceptibility. Genotypic analysis revealed a single point mutation in the β subunit in resistant parasites. The resultant tyrosine 837 to cysteine alteration in the β subunit corresponded to the binding site for the THQ and peptide substrate. Biochemical analysis of Y837C-PFT demonstrated a 13-fold increase in BMS-388891 concentration necessary for inhibiting 50% of the enzyme activity. These data are consistent with PFT as the target of BMS-388891 in P. falciparum and suggest that PFT inhibitors should be combined with other antimalarial agents for effective therapy. The post-translational farnesylation of proteins serves to anchor a subset of intracellular proteins to membranes in eukaryotic organisms and also promotes protein-protein interactions. Inhibition of protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) is lethal to the pathogenic protozoa Plasmodium falciparum. Parasites were isolated that were resistant to BMS-388891, a tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) PFT inhibitor. Resistance was associated with a 12-fold decrease in drug susceptibility. Genotypic analysis revealed a single point mutation in the β subunit in resistant parasites. The resultant tyrosine 837 to cysteine alteration in the β subunit corresponded to the binding site for the THQ and peptide substrate. Biochemical analysis of Y837C-PFT demonstrated a 13-fold increase in BMS-388891 concentration necessary for inhibiting 50% of the enzyme activity. These data are consistent with PFT as the target of BMS-388891 in P. falciparum and suggest that PFT inhibitors should be combined with other antimalarial agents for effective therapy. Malaria causes about 300 million infections annually. 1www.mmv.org (2004). Approximately 90% of the deaths occur in Africa, with falciparum malaria a major contributor. For decades, malaria chemotherapy has relied on a limited number of drugs. Acquisition and spread of resistance to these drugs is largely responsible for a recent increase in malaria-related mortality (2.May J. Meyer C.G.

Investig. 2004; 113: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). This increasing burden caused by drug-resistant parasites has led investigators to seek out novel antimalarial drug targets. Among these are enzymes necessary for cellular division and differentiation. Previous work has demonstrated that the enzyme protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) 2The abbreviations used are: PFT, protein farnesyltransferase; THQ, tetrahydroquinoline; PFTI, protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor; PfPFT, P. falciparum PFT; FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; WT, wild type. is a viable drug target for pathogenic protozoa, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (4.Buckner F.S.

Utilizing this existing resource, we have been able to demonstrate that low nanomolar concentrations of tetrahydroquinoline (THQ)-based PFTIs inhibit P. falciparum PFT (PfPFT) and are cytotoxic to parasites both in vitro and in vivo. 3Nallan, L., Bauer, K.

S., Chakrabarti, D., Gelb, M. H., and Van Voorhis, W. C. (2005) J. Med. Chem., in press. PFT in eukaryotic cells catalyzes the transfer of a 15-carbon isoprenoid lipid unit, a farnesyl group, from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to the C terminus of a specific set of proteins, including the Ras superfamily G-proteins (12.Yokoyama K. Goodwin G.W. Ghomashchi F. Glomset J. Gelb M.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to the Ras superfamily proteins, which are involved in the cell cycle, another protein that has been shown to be farnesylated is CENP-E, a centromere-associating protein, which plays a critical role in cell cycle progression during the M-phase (13.Abrieu A. Kahana J.A. Wood K.W. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2000; 102: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the identification of farnesylated proteins in P. falciparum and their role in mediating PFTI toxicity are currently under investigation. Because of the enzymatic nature of the drug target, we have begun to investigate potential P. falciparum resistance to PFTIs. The THQ PFTI used in this work, BMS-388891 (Fig. 1), is a potent inhibitor of parasite proliferation and causes severe defects in maturation. 3Nallan, L., Bauer, K.

In addition, when parasites were treated with BMS-388891 and the farnesylated proteins were labeled with [3H]farnesol, there was a significant decrease in labeled 37–75-kDa proteins. 3Nallan, L., Bauer, K.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9389-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we describe the selection of P. falciparum parasites resistant to BMS-388891 and present genetic and enzymological analyses of these parasites. We analyze the native PFT enzyme of the parent and resistant clones and demonstrate that an amino acid substitution is responsible for PFTI resistance. In addition, using the solved crystal structure of the mammalian protein farnesyltransferase, we created a model for the P. falciparum PFT enzyme that explains the THQ-PFT binding interactions and explains the molecular mechanism of resistance (15.Dunten P.

Our work demonstrates PFT as the target for THQ PFTIs and provides a tool for further characterization of the PFT enzyme in an effort to develop this as a target of antimalarial chemotherapy. Parasites—Experiments described in this study were performed with a clone of P. falciparum Dd2 strain parasites, which is derived from clone W2 (14.Rathod P.K. McErlean T. Lee P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9389-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Parasites were cultured in an asynchronous manner in vitro using standard conditions and media (19.Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Parasites from infected erythrocytes were isolated for PFT enzyme extraction by treatment with 0.1% (w/v) saponin. Selection of BMS-388891-resistant Parasites—Selection of resistant parasites was conducted as described previously (14.Rathod P.K. McErlean T. Lee P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9389-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 20.Rathod P.K. Khosla M. Gassis S. Young R.D. Lutz C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2871-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, triplicate 30-ml cultures with a 2% hematocrit and 108 infected red blood cells of an isogenic, recently cloned population of P. falciparum Dd2 (WT) were challenged with varying concentrations of THQ BMS-388891 (300, 100, 33.3, 11.1, and 3.7 nm) in the culture medium. In addition, triplicate flasks were inoculated with 10 parasites as a growth control to gauge when limiting numbers of parasites would appear by microscopy. The medium was changed every other day, maintaining the initial drug concentration, and fresh red blood cells were added once per week. Cultures were maintained under continuous drug pressure for 80 days. Giemsa-stained blood smears of cultures were used to detect parasite outgrowth, and a 2% infected red blood cell level was considered positive. Clonal isolates of resistant parasites from drug-challenged cultures were generated by limiting dilutions. Proliferation Assays, ED50—In vitro responses to the THQ PFTI were calculated from 72-h [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assays as described previously (21.Desjardins R.E. Canfield C.J. Haynes J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar, 22.Jiang L. Lee P.C. White J. Rathod P.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1047-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Incorporation of [3H]hypoxanthine into nucleic acids was measured using a Chameleon liquid scintillation counter (Hidex, Turku, Finland). The ability of the PFTI to reduce the parasite growth was reported as an ED50 value, the effective dose of PFTI that reduces the hypoxanthine incorporation by 50%, compared with the untreated positive control after subtraction of a no parasite background control. Genetic Analysis—Genomic DNA was isolated from the parasites using standard phenol/chloroform protocols. Duplicate independent PCR reactions for both the PFT α and β subunits were amplified using the Expand high fidelity polymerase PCR System (Roche Applied Science). These amplicons were ligated into the pGEMT cloning vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and five Escherichia coli transformants derived from each PCR reaction were sequenced. Sequencing results were analyzed using Vector NTI Suite 9.0 (Invitrogen).

Peak fractions were concentrated using a Vivaspin 15R concentrator according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). Assays for PfPFT activity were performed with a PFT-specific scintillation proximity assay kit (Amersham Biosciences) slightly modified from the one described previously (23.Chakrabarti D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42066-42073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).3 One μm biotinylated lamin B peptide substrate (biotin-YRASNRSCAIM) was used. The concentration of [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) (3.7 MBq) was increased beyond the manufacturer's recommendations to 1 μm to ensure that the enzyme substrate was in excess of its likely Km value (the Km of farnesyl diphosphate for human PFT is 9.3 ± 5.8 nm) (24.Omer C.A. Kral A.M. Diehl R.E. Prendergast G.C. Powers S. Allen C.M. Gibbs J.B. Kohl N.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Increasing the FPP concentration to 2 μm had no effect on the amount of the product formed (data not shown). All reactions were performed in triplicate. Controls (no enzyme reaction values) were subtracted from experimental values before calculation of percent inhibition. The effectiveness of the PFTI is reported as an IC50 value, the concentration of inhibitor that reduces the activity of the enzyme by 50% compared with the untreated positive control. Determination of Km for the Peptide Substrate—Determination of the Km value for the peptide substrate of the PFT enzyme was conducted using the scintillation proximity assay as described above. The FPP substrate concentration was 1 μm, whereas the peptide substrate concentrations used were 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 μm. Each experiment was repeated in duplicate for both the WT and mutant enzymes. Control values obtained from reactions with no peptide substrate were subtracted from the experimental values. The experimental values were graphed as velocity as determined by counts per min obtained as a function of peptide substrate concentration. These values were fitted to a Michaelis-Menten plot using Prism 3.0 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). Determination of the Ki Values for BMS-388891—Ki values of BMS-388891 for both the WT and mutant native PFT enzyme were obtained by non-linear regression fit of percent inhibition versus inhibitor concentration at fixed peptide substrate concentration (1 μm). The Km values for the WT and Y837C enzyme were used to obtain the value of Ki for the PFTI by fitting the observed rate data from the IC50 experiments as a function of inhibitor concentration at constant peptide substrate concentration by non-linear regression. In Equation 1, Vi/V0 is the ratio of enzyme activity in the presence of inhibitor over the activity without inhibitor, S is the peptide substrate concentration, Km is the value determined for each enzyme (see Table II), and I is the concentration of BMS-388891.

Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar), version 6v2, was used for the creation of the homology model of PfPFT. The crystal structure of rat PFT complexed with the non-substrate tetrapeptide inhibitor CVFM and FPP was used as the template structure (Protein Data Bank file 1JCR (18.Long S.B. Hancock P.J. Kral A.M. Hellinga H.W. Beese L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12948-12953Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)). The sequences of the two subunits of PfPFT were obtained from the PlasmoDB data base (www.plasmodb.org, Gene loci: PFL2050w for α and chr11.glm_528 for β). A BLAST search resulted in 14 α- and 12 β-subunit sequences. They were aligned with the program T-COFFEE (26.Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar). The pairwise sequence alignment used for the homology modeling was extracted from this multiple alignment. Only regions with reasonable reliability of the alignment were included. The model of PfPFT comprises the following sequence segments (throughout the text corresponding residue numbers of rat PFT are given in parentheses; these also correspond to the residue numbers of human PFT): α: 72–164 (Ratα87–179), 300–411 (Ratα184–283); β: 421–677 (Ratβ71–315), 806–896 (Ratβ330–417). The levels of sequence identity (similarity) between PfPFT and rat PFT in these regions amount to 23% (53%) for the α-subunit and 37% (56%) for the β-subunit. The catalytic zinc ion, six structurally conserved water molecules (Protein Data Bank water residue numbers in 1JCR: 1163, 1167, 1170, 1241, 1573, 1181), and FPP were included in the model. The conformation of FPP was considered to be flexible during the model calculations. For this purpose parameters for FPP were added to the MODELLER force field using the lipid parameters of the “charmm27” force field (27.Feller S.E. Gawrisch K. MacKerell Jr., A.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). 20 different models of PfPFT were calculated. The model with the lowest value of the objective function of MODELLER was used for further work. The model of the mutant Tyr-β837 to Cys was obtained by replacing tyrosine with cysteine and selecting the lowest energy rotamer with INSIGHTII (version 97.0; Accelrys Inc.). Ligand Docking Calculations—The program FLO (version 6.02) (28.McMartin C. Bohacek R.S. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1997; 11: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) was used for the docking of BMS-388891, which contains a sulfonamide functional group (Fig. 1). Most sulfonamide nitrogens show significant deviations from planarity, i.e. they are pyramidalized (29.Ohwada T. Okamoto I. Shudo K. Yamaguchi K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 7877-7880Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The NM atom type of FLO takes this into account but does not allow for the inversion of the sulfonamide nitrogen during Monte Carlo conformational searches. To consider the inversion, both stereochemical configurations of this nitrogen were considered in separate calculations. Thus, to account for both configurations of the chiral carbon atom and of the sulfonamide nitrogen, four docking calculations were necessary. The initial placements of the four stereochemical configurations of BMS-388891 were obtained by modifying the structure of BMS-214662, a tetrahydrobenzodiazepine (Fig. 1), as observed in the x-ray structure with rat PFT (17.Reid T.S. Beese L.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) after superpositioning this structure on the PfPFT homology model. 2000 cycles of Metropolis Monte Carlo conformational searches were performed for each starting configuration of BMS-388891 in the PfPFT binding site employing the MCDOCK module of the FLO program. A distance restraint was introduced for the bond between the imidazole nitrogen and the zinc ion. BMS-388891-resistant P. falciparum Clones Can Be Selected—Earlier studies demonstrated that P. falciparum 3D7 was highly sensitive to growth inhibition by the THQ PFTI, BMS-388891, with an ED50 of 7.0 nm.3 To determine whether resistance to BMS-388891 could occur, a one-step selection protocol was used employing varying concentrations of BMS-388891. We employed a recently cloned Dd2 strain, which is prone to the acquisition of drug resistance (14.Rathod P.K. McErlean T. Lee P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9389-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In cultures treated with 100 nm BMS-388891, two of three flasks developed parasite growth by day 21. Flasks with inhibitor concentrations of 33.3, 11.1, or 3.7 nm and the no drug 10 parasite control flasks all had demonstrable parasites by day 11. In contrast, after 80 days of continuous culturing the remaining flask challenged with 100 nm BMS-388891 and all of the flasks challenged with 300 nm BMS-388891 remained negative for parasites. Clonal parasites were derived from the populations of the two 100-nm flasks in which parasite outgrowth occurred, and these clones were used for further experimentation. Growth rate of the drug-resistant clones with or without drug pressure did not differ significantly from the WT population without drug pressure (data not shown). BMS-388891-resistant Clones Show 12-Fold Resistance—Resistant clones obtained from the two 100-nm BMS-388891-treated flasks showed altered ED50 values compared with the WT clone, which had an ED50 of 10 nm. Clonal isolates obtained from the drug selection had an ED50 value of 105 nm (clone B10), 110 nm (clone G7), and 120 nm (clone H7), a 12-fold increase in resistance to the inhibitor (Fig. 2). ED50 experiments were conducted multiple times (WT, n = 5; G7, n = 4; H7, n = 7; B10, n = 3). Student's t test demonstrated significance between the ED50 values of the WT and each resistant clone (p < 0.01). These clonal isolates retained identical ED50 values after 6 weeks of culture without drug pressure (data not shown). Thus the BMS-388891 resistance phenotype in these clones is stable in the absence of drug pressure. A Single Amino Acid Substitution Causes the Resistance Phenotype—To identify the basis of resistance, both the α and β genes of PFT from all three resistant clones and the WT clone were sequenced. Only a single nucleotide difference in the β PFT gene was found between the parent and the resistant clones, resistant clones being 100% identical. Multiple E. coli transformants from independent PCRs were used for sequencing to rule out PCR-induced errors. The single point mutation was a transition from an adenine to a guanine in the β gene. This mutation altered the predicted amino acid coding of the β subunit at position 837 from a tyrosine to a cysteine. Fig. 3 shows a fragment of the predicted amino acid alignment of the PFT β subunit from P. falciparum Dd2 WT, P. falciparum Dd2 Y837C mutant clone (all three clones have identical nucleotide sequence), and the human sequence (NCBI accession number P49356). Of note, by sequencing the cDNA we can infer the presence of an intron near the 3′-end of the PFT α (data not shown, GenBank™ accession number AY880030). This intron is not currently noted in either the NCBI or PlasmoDB database. Mutant PfPFT Has a Decreased Affinity for BMS-388891 and Has an Increased Affinity for Peptide Substrate—The IC50 value for PFT enzyme extracted from the P. falciparum Dd2 WT clone was 0.7 nm. This is similar to the value that was found previously for P. falciparum 3D7 (0.6 nm).3 However, the mutant PFT enzyme extracted from resistant clone H7 had an IC50 value against BMS-388891 of 9 nm, 13-fold higher than the WT enzyme (Fig. 4). This is almost identical to the 12-fold shift seen in the ED50 value comparing WT and resistant isolates. This correlation implicates the alteration of the PFT enzyme as the cause for the observed drug resistance of the parasite and thus demonstrates that the mechanism of action of the THQ class of PFT inhibitors is by direct interaction and inhibition of the PFT enzyme. IC50 experiments for both the WT enzyme and the Y837C mutant enzyme were conducted three times with a Student's t test demonstrating p < 0.01, a statistically significant difference. The Km values of both WT and the Y837C mutant PFT enzyme for the peptide substrate YRASNRSCAIM is listed in Table II. The values from the calculation of BMS-388891 Ki values for both WT and the Y837C enzyme are shown in Table II. The mutated enzyme has a higher affinity for the peptide substrate (lower Km) and also reduced the binding affinity of BMS-388891 (higher Ki). Together these alterations allow the mutant PFT enzyme to function in the presence of higher concentrations of PFTI compared with the WT PFT enzyme. Of note, this class of PFTIs has displayed little to no selectivity for the P. falciparum PFT enzyme compared with the mammalian PFT enzyme (data not shown). This lack of selectivity is supported by the homology model (see below). Homology Model of PfPFT—The homology model of PfPFT reveals that despite the relatively low overall level of sequence identity (see under “Experimental Procedures”), many of the residues contacting BMS-214662 in mammalian PFT are conserved (17.Reid T.S. Beese L.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Five conservative substitutions of the surface residues in proximity of the inhibitor are obvious. Residues in rat PFT with a side chain atom within 7Å from BMS-214662 that are replaced in PfPFT (RatPFT→PfPFT) are: Tyr-β93 → Leu-β443 (3.6 Å), Cys-β95 → Ser-β445 (4.5 Å), Tyr-α166 → Phe-α151 (4.8 Å), Phe-β360 → Tyr-β836 (5.5 Å), Ala-α129 → Ser-α114 (6.1 Å) (Fig. 5). The conformation of the FPP molecule, which contributes to the surface contacting BMS-214662, was left unchanged by MODELLER. Docking of BMS-388891—The best predicted binding mode of BMS-388891 to wild-type PfPFT was obtained for the (S)-enantiomer. It shows high similarity to the binding mode of BMS-214662 (Fig. 5); the root mean square deviation of the cyano-phenyl group and the adjacent carbon and nitrogen atoms of the saturated ring and of the zinc-binding R3 groups (Fig. 1) amounts to 1.2 Å. The BMS-388891 R2 fills the pocket occupied by the benzyl substituent of BMS-214662. The pocket is partly formed by the side chain of Tyr-β837[Ratβ361], but only one of the two terminal carbon atoms of R2 is contacting this side chain. Both sulfonamide oxygen atoms are solvent accessible. One of them is located at a distance of 3.5 Å from the NH2 side chain nitrogen atom of Arg-β564[Ratβ202], suggesting that minor changes of the position of this side chain might allow for the formation of a hydrogen bond. In fact, minimization of the ligand in the docked orientation considering the side chain conformation of Arg-β564[Ratβ202] as flexible, lead to formation of this hydrogen bond (N–O distance: 3.0 Å). The arginine side chain shows a slight shift toward the sulfonamide group upon the minimization, whereas the ligand position remains unchanged. The imidazole attached to the SO2 group (R1 in Fig. 1) is contacting the phenyl ring of Phe-α151[RatTyr-α166] in an edge to face orientation. The 16 best predicted ligand binding positions show a highly conserved placement of R2, whereas the position of R1 shows variability. However, in most cases the edge to face orientation of R1 with the Phe-α151 phenyl ring is maintained. The best predicted binding energy for the WT enzyme is –21.1 kJ/mol. (Note that the association energy contributed by the binding of the imidazole nitrogen atom to the zinc ion is not considered by the docking program.) The BMS-388891 binding mode predicted"
https://openalex.org/W2028141811,"Beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m) is a major component of amyloid fibrils deposited in patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis. Recent studies have focused on the mechanism by which amyloid fibrils are formed under physiological conditions, which had been difficult to reproduce quantitatively. Yamamoto et al. (Yamamoto, S., Hasegawa, K., Yamaguchi, I., Tsutsumi, S., Kardos, J., Goto, Y., Gejyo, F. & Naiki, H. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 11075-11082) showed that a combination of seed fibrils prepared under acidic conditions and a low concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate below its critical micelle concentration enabled extensive fibril formation at pH 7.0. Here, we found that repeated self-seeding at pH 7.0 with fibrils formed at the same pH causes a marked acceleration of growth, indicating the maturation of fibrils. The observed maturation can be simulated by assuming the existence of two types of fibrils with different growth rates. Importantly, some mutations of beta2-m or the addition of a low concentration of urea, both destabilizing the native conformation, were not enough to extend the fibrils at pH 7.0, and a low concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate (i.e. 0.5 mM) was essential. Thus, even though the first stage fibrils in patients are unstable and require stabilizing factors to remain at neutral pH, they can adapt to a neutral pH with repeated self-seeding, implying a mechanism of development of amyloid deposition after a long latent period in patients."

A knowledge of the structural and functional characteristics of the Hsp40 family is therefore essential for understanding the role of the Hsp70 chaperone system in cells. In this work, we used small angle x-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation to study two representatives of human Hsp40, namely, DjA1 (Hdj2/dj2/HSDJ/Rdj1) from subfamily A and DjB4 (Hlj1/DnaJW) from subfamily B, and to determine their quaternary structure. We also constructed low resolution models for the structure of DjA1-(1–332), a C-terminal-deleted mutant of DjA1 in which dimer formation is prevented. Our results, together with the current structural information of the Hsp40 C-terminal and J-domains, were used to generate models of the internal structural organization of DjA1 and DjB4. The characteristics of these models indicated that DjA1 and DjB4 were both dimers, but with substantial differences in their quaternary structures: whereas DjA1 consisted of a compact dimer in which the N and C termini of the two monomers faced each other, DjB4 formed a dimer in which only the C termini of the two monomers were in contact. The two proteins also differed in their ability to bind unfolded luciferase.

Cell Stress Chaper. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), Hsp40 proteins are classified in three main subfamilies (A–C, also referred to as types I-III; Fig. 1A) (4.Mayer M.P.

Cell Stress Chaper. 2000; 5: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar): subfamily A consists of proteins with the four domains described above, subfamily B contains proteins that lack the Cys-rich domain, and subfamily C has only the J-domain that is not necessarily located at the N terminus (4.Mayer M.P.

Hsp40 proteins of subfamily A have autonomous chaperone activity and may therefore work in an Hsp70-dependent or -independent manner. In contrast, Hsp40 proteins of subfamily B have no autonomous chaperone activity and depend on Hsp70 for full activity (18.Lee S. Fan C.Y. Younger J.M. Ren H. Cyr D.M. J. Biol.

Although high resolution structures of the C-terminal, Cys-rich, and J-domains are available, there is still little information about how these domains interact with each other, with other domains and also with Hsp70. To obtain further information about relevant structural and functional characteristics of human Hsp40 proteins, we used biophysical methods, including small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and analytical ultra-centrifugation (AUC), to study DjA1 (also known as Hdj2/dj2/HSDJ/Rdj1), a representative of subfamily A, its C-terminal deletion mutant (DjA1-(1–332)), and DjB4 (also known as Hlj1/DnaJW), a representative of subfamily B that shares 65% identity with DjB1/Hdj1. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—DjA1 was cloned from the human gene DNAJA1 (cDNA clone, GenBank™ accession number AW247277) and DjB4 was cloned from the human gene DNAJB4 (cDNA clone, GenBank™ accession number AA081471). The Hsp40 nomenclatures DjA1 and DjB4 were used as described by Ohtsuka and Hata (34.Ohtsuka K. Hata M. Cell Stress Chaper. 2000; 5: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Two primers were used to amplify the DjA1 cDNA by PCR and to create restriction enzyme sites for NdeI and XhoI: a DjA1 5′-primer (5′-CCGGCAGGCTAGCATGGTGAAAGAAACAAC-3′) containing an NdeI restriction site and a DjA1 3′-primer (5′-TGAGTGTTATTCTCGAGTCATTAAGAGGTCTG-3′) containing an XhoI restriction site. Two primers were used to amplify the DjB4 cDNA by PCR and to create restriction enzyme sites for NdeI and BamHI: a DjB4 5′-primer (5′-TCAAGGCATTCCATATGGGGAAAGACTATTA-3′) containing an NdeI restriction site and a DjB4 3′-primer (5′-GTGTAACAAAGTGGATCCTACTATGAGGCAGG-3′) containing a BamHI restriction site. The C-terminal deletion of DjA1 was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a primer that created a stop codon at residue Phe333 followed by a restriction site for XhoI (5′-TTATCAGGCTCGAGTTAGCCATTCTC-3′). The PCR products were cloned into the pET28A expression vector (Novagen) for His tag purification methods. The correct cloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing using an ABI 377 Prism system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). These procedures created the vectors pET28aDjA1, pET28aDjB4, and pET28aDjA1-(1–332), which were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for heterologous protein expression by adding isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside (0.4 mm) at A600 = 0.6. The induced cells were grown for 5 h and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,600 × g. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl and 10 mm EDTA; 15 ml of buffer/liter of medium) in the presence of 5 units of DNase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 30 μg of lysozyme/ml (Sigma) for 30 min. The pellet was then disrupted by sonication in an ice bath, and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was fractionated by metal affinity chromatography in a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) using an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted with imidazole (500 mm) and loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex 200-pg column (2.6 cm × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) using an AKTA FPLC system. The degree of purification was estimated by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a calculated extinction coefficient for denatured proteins (37.Edelhock H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar, 38.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Analytical Molecular Exclusion Chromatography—Analytical molecular exclusion chromatography was done using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) column coupled to an AKTA Purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, and β-mercaptoethanol (1–10 mm). The column was washed with two column volumes of this same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and aliquots of proteins in 100 μl were loaded onto the column. The elution profile was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. The apparent molecular mass was calculated using a plot of ln of the molecular mass (kDa) of standard proteins (thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; γ-globulin, 160 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 69 kDa; chicken ovalbumin, 45 kDa; cytochrome c, 12 kDa) versus the retention time. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were done using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with the temperature controlled by a Peltier-type control system PFD 425S. Hsp40 proteins were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol at final concentrations of 20–50 μm. The data were collected at a scanning rate of 50 nm/min with a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm using a 0.1-mm path length cell. CDNN deconvolution software (Version 2, Bioinformatik.biochemtech. uni-halle.dee/cdnn) was used for secondary structure prediction. All buffers used were of analytical grade and were filtered before use to avoid light scattering by small particles. Measurement of Chaperone Activity—The method described by Lu and Cyr (28.Lu Z.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) was used to assess the ability of Hsp40 proteins to interact with unfolded proteins. Briefly, luciferase (Promega) was chemically denatured by diluting in guanidinium-HCl (6 m) for 40 min at room temperature and then diluted 25× in 50 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the absence and presence of His-tagged Hsp40 proteins (see figure captions for details of the concentrations). In another protocol, luciferase (2 μm) was thermally denatured by incubation at 42 °C for 10 min in the absence and presence of His-tagged Hsp40 proteins (see figure captions for details of the concentrations) and then cooled to room temperature. The solutions were centrifuged for 10 min at 21,000 × g, and 50 μlofthe supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of Talon metal chelate resin (Clontech) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C, and the pellet containing the resin was washed twice with 75 μl of the Tris buffer indicated above containing 15 mm imidazole. The protein complexes bound to the resin were eluted with this same Tris buffer containing 150 mm imidazole and then concentrated by precipitation with acetone 80% (Merck) and visualized by SDS-PAGE. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments were done with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. The proteins DjA1, DjA1-(1–332), and DjB4 were tested at concentrations from 50 to 1000 μg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol (but not for DjA1-(1–332)) and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, with no apparent aggregation. The sedimentation velocity experiments were done at 20 °C, 25,000 rpm for DjA1 and DjB4, and 30,000 and 40,000 rpm for DjA1-(1–332) (AN-60Ti rotor), and the scan data were acquired at 230 and 238 nm for low and high protein concentrations, respectively. The sedimentation equilibrium experiments were done at 20 °C at speeds of 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 rpm with the AN-60Ti rotor and scan data acquisition at 238 nm. Analysis of the data involved the fitting of a model of absorbance versus cell radius data using nonlinear regression. All fittings were done using the Origin software package (Microcal Software) supplied with the instrument. The van Holde-Weischet (39.Van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1397-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) (sediment coefficient plot) and the sedimentation time derivative (g(s*) integral distribution) (40.Stafford W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) methods were used to analyze the sedimentation velocity experiments. The methods used to analyze the velocity and equilibrium experiments allowed the calculation of the apparent sedimentation coefficient s, the diffusion coefficient D, and the molecular mass M. The ratio of the sedimentation to diffusion coefficients gave the molecular mass in Equation 1, M=sRTD(1−Vbarρ) (Eq. 1) where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The Sednterp software (www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm) was used to estimate the partial specific volume of the proteins at 20 °C (VbarDjA1 = 0.7275 ml/g, VbarDjA1-(1–332) = 0.7309 ml/g, and VbarDjB4 = 0.7302 ml/g), the buffer density (ρ = 1.02163 g/ml) and the buffer viscosity (η = 1.0851 × 10–2 poise). The self-association method was used to analyze the sedimentation equilibrium experiments, and several models of association for DjA1 and DjB4 were used to fit the data. The distribution of each protein throughout the cell, as determined in the equilibrium sedimentation experiments, was fitted with Equation 2 (41.Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), C=C0exp[M(1−Vbarρ)ω2(r2−r0)2RT] (Eq. 2) where C is the protein concentration at radial position r, C0 is the protein concentration at radial position r0, and ω is the centrifugal angular velocity. The Sednterp software was used to estimate the standard sedimentation coefficients (s20,w) at each protein concentration and to calculate s20,w0 by extrapolation to a protein concentration of 0 mg/ml. This procedure corrects for effects of temperature, solution viscosity, and molecular crowding (42.Laue T.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). SAXS—The SAXS experiments were done at the SAS beamline of the LNLS synchrotron radiation facility in Campinas, Brazil (43.Kellermann G. Vicentin F. Tamura E. Rocha M. Tolentino H. Barbosa A. Craievich A. Torriani I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 880-883Crossref Google Scholar) under the same conditions as those described by Borges et al. (44.Borges J.C. Fischer H. Craievich A.F. Hansen L.D. Ramos C.H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35337-35344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The measurements were done using a monochromatic x-ray beam with a wavelength λ = 1.488 Å. For a sample-to-detector distance of 840 mm selected for the experiments, the modulus of the photon momentum transfer (q = 4πsinθ/λ, 2θ being the scattering angle) covered a range from q = 0.01 Å–1 to q = 0.44 Å–1. The scattering intensity curves, I(q), were recorded using a gas 1 dimensional position sensitive x-ray detector. To monitor possible effects from radiation damage and synchrotron beam instabilities, the SAXS curves were determined in many short frames (90 s each). The SAXS data obtained were normalized to account for the natural decay in intensity of the synchrotron incident beam and were corrected for non-homogeneous detector responses. Finally, the scattering intensity produced by the buffer was subtracted, and the difference curves were scaled to give equivalent protein concentrations. Three types of samples with different concentrations were studied by SAXS: 1) 3.3 mg/ml DjA1 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2) 2.9 and 6.5 mg/ml of DjA1-(1–332) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 3) 2.5, 4.4, 6.2, and 8.3 mg/ml DjB4 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Reliable structural information about the low resolution structure of proteins in solution can be derived from SAXS data provided that all proteins are in the same (monomeric or oligomeric) state and that the solution is “dilute,” i.e. interference effects in scattering amplitudes produced by different proteins are negligible. Under these assumptions, the total scattering amplitude is proportional to the form factor of an isolated (monomeric or oligomeric) protein averaged for all orientations. When samples with a high concentration were available, data merging was done using low and high concentration samples for the high and low q ranges of the scattering intensity, respectively. This procedure reduced the overall statistical error in the scattering curves without introducing unwanted interferences or spatial correlation effects in the small q range. To establish the molecular masses of DjA1, DjA1-(1–332), and DjB4, the SAXS intensity produced by a solution of bovine serum albumin (69 kDa, 5 and 10 mg/ml) was also determined. Since, for dilute solutions, the normalized intensity extrapolated to q = 0, I(0), is proportional to the molecular mass, the molecular masses (M) of the proteins investigated here were determined from the ratios between the I(0) values corresponding to the different samples and that of the standard bovine serum albumin. Computer Programs—By applying the indirect Fourier transform program GNOM (45.Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar) to the normalized SAXS curves, the distance distribution function p(r) and the radius of gyration, Rg, of the proteins studied were evaluated (46.Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). Prior to GNOM analysis, a constant intensity background was subtracted from the SAXS data to ensure that the intensity at higher angles decayed as q–4, according to Porod's law for a two-electron density model (46.Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). The low resolution shapes (or molecular envelopes) of the proteins were restored from the experimental SAXS curves using an ab initio method named DAMMIN (47.Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar) and recently described in Borges et al. (44.Borges J.C. Fischer H. Craievich A.F. Hansen L.D. Ramos C.H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35337-35344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, in this method, the low resolution shape of the protein was simulated by a set of small spheres that initially filled another sphere with a diameter equal to the maximum diameter, Dmax, of the protein being studied (previously determined using GNOM). DAMMIN yielded a structural model containing a fraction of the initial number of dummy atoms whose associated scattering intensity gave the best fit to the SAXS data. The configuration of the different protein domains could be refined by manually rotating or displacing the domains until the discrepancy between the calculated and experimental SAXS curves was minimized. The protein models were displayed using the program WebLab ViewerLite software (www.accelrys.com). The HydroPro software (48.Garcia de la Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) was used to estimate the translational diffusion coefficient Dt, the radii of gyration Rg, the sedimentation coefficient s, and the maximum distance (Dmax) starting from the ab initio models generated by DAMMIN using SAXS data obtained at 20 °C. The HydroPro software was configured with the radius of the atomic elements from the ab initio analysis, with sigma factors from 5 to 8 (as indicated by the supplier) and a minibeads radius from 6 to 2 Å (SIGMIN and SIGMAX), after an initial evaluation of the two extremes. The parameters Vbar, ρ, and η were estimated using the software Sednterp as described above. The translational fraction ratio or Perrin factor P, which indicates the relationship between the frictional coefficient of the Hsp40 particles and a sphere of the same molecular mass (f/f0), was estimated using Solpro software (49.Garcia de la Torre J. Carrasco B. Harding S.E. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Purification of DjA1 and DjB4 as Folded Dimers and of DjA1-(1–332) as a Folded Monomer—The correct cloning and sequencing of DjA1, DjB4, and DjA1-(1–332) were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All of the proteins were expressed in large quantities and were more than 95% pure as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). The proteins were unstable at low ionic strength but were soluble in the presence of 500 mm NaCl. DjA1 and DjB4 were purified as dimers and the mutant DjA1-(1–332) was purified as a monomer, as confirmed by analytical molecular exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2B). The folding state of the proteins was investigated by CD, and the resulting spectra corresponded to folded proteins with a minimum at 208 nm (Fig. 2C). The analysis using the CDNN deconvolution software indicated that the proteins had similar amounts of secondary structure: 35% β-sheet structure and 10% α-helices. The high content of β-sheet structure agreed with x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance data indicating the presence of β-sheet structures in the C terminus (22.Li J. Qian X. Sha B.

https://openalex.org/W2164455207,"The role of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in the central control of blood pressure (BP) has not been elucidated in spite of peripheral sEH overexpression being linked to hypertension. Thus, our objective was to investigate the involvement of brain sEH in BP control. sEH expression in the hypothalamus and brain stem, two cardioregulatory brain areas, was increased in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) compared to the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat. Inhibition of the enzyme by intracerebroventricular (icv) delivery of AUDA further increased both BP and heart rate (HR) by 32 +/- 6 mmHg and 54 +/- 10 bpm, respectively, (P<0.05) in the SHR. Analysis of waveform telemetry data revealed a decrease in spontaneous baroreceptor reflex gain following sEH inhibition, indicating the sustained increase in BP may be due to a decrease in baroreceptor reflex function. The hypertensive effect of sEH inhibition is likely a result of an increase in epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET)-mediated generation of ROS. This view is supported by the following: 1) Inhibition of EET formation attenuates AUDA-induced increase in BP; 2) delivery of an EET agonist increases BP and HR in the WKY rat, and 3) inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase by gp91ds-tat prevents AUDA-induced increases in BP and HR. Finally, electrophysiological studies demonstrate that AUDA increased neuronal firing rate exclusively in the SHR, an effect completely abolished by gp91ds-tat. These observations suggest that EETs and sEH inhibition are involved in increasing BP in the SHR. We suggest that an increased expression of sEH is a futile central nervous system response in protection against hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1977952110,"The transfer of phospholipids across membrane bilayers is protein-mediated, and most of the established transporters catalyze the energy-dependent efflux of phospholipids from cells.

The 2-acyl-GPE metabolic cycle begins with the transfer of the 1-position fatty acid of PtdEtn to the N terminus of the major outer membrane lipoprotein (Fig. 1) (1Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11328-11333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Topologically, the prolipoprotein is secreted through the inner membrane, and all of the subsequent processing steps, proteolytic cleavage (2Munoa F.J. Miller K.W. Beers R. Graham M. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17667-17672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transfer of the diacylglycerol (3Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and N-acylation (4Gupta S.D. Wu H.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 78: 37-41Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Gupta S.D. Gan K. Schmid M.B. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16551-16556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are located on the outer aspect of the inner membrane. The 2-acyl-GPE generated as a product of this reaction is re-acylated by the bifunctional enzyme 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase/acyl-ACP synthetase (Aas) (6Cooper C.L. Hsu L. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7384-7389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jackowski S. Jackson P.D. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase can either activate a free fatty acid with ATP-Mg2+ and transfer it to a bound ACP subunit or interact directly with acyl-ACP produced by the biosynthetic pathway to transfer a fatty acid to 2-acyl-GPE and re-generate PtdEtn. In cells lacking PtdEtn, other lipid species are used to acylate the N terminus of the lipoprotein (8Gupta S.D. Dowhan W. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9983-9986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The missing piece in the 2-acyl-GPE cycle is the understanding of how the 2-acyl-GPE on the outside of the cell is translocated to the cytoplasmic aspect of the inner membrane to be acylated by Aas. One possibility is that the lipid simply diffuses or spontaneously flips across the membrane. However, this scenario seems unlikely, because protein transport systems appear to be required for the movement of phospholipids across cell membranes. The best known transporters are members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily (TC 3.A.1) that possess two ABC domains, which hydrolyze ATP, and energize unidirectional substrate transport through the membrane-spanning domains of these complexes (9Locher K.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Borst P. Elferink R.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). This group of transporters translocates phospholipids, sterols, bile acids, and hydrophobic drugs (11Dassa E. Hofnung M. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 887-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). They were first recognized as multidrug transporters that interfere with the control of cancer by mediating the extrusion of cytotoxic drugs from the cell (12Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar). E. coli has homologues to these transporters such as MsbA, which is clearly implicated in the ATP-dependent efflux of lipid A and phospholipids from the interior of the cell (13Zhou Z. White K.A.

Bacteria also possess a family of proton-dependent efflux systems for hydrophobic drugs, polyketides, lipooligosaccharide signaling molecules, and outer membrane lipids known as the resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily (TC 2.A.6) (18Tseng T.T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.H. Goffeau A. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 107-125PubMed Google Scholar). AcrB of E. coli is a typical member of this class whose substrates include hydrophobic drugs such as acridine (19Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Lipid transporters in this superfamily include the MmpL7 (20Camacho L.R. Constant P. Raynaud C. Laneelle M.A. Triccas J.A.

Another class of flippase is the eukaryotic phospholipid scramblase that facilitates the calcium-dependent externalization of phosphatidylserine from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (23Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 24Wiedmer T. Zhou Q. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Bacterial homologues of phospholipid scramblase are not known.This report describes the identification of a Lysophospholipid Transporter (LplT) that translocates 2-acyl-GPE to the cytoplasmic aspect of the inner membrane. This new lipid transporter does not belong to either the ABC or resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily of transporters that are known to utilize lipid substrates but rather is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (TC 2.A.1), which consists of integral membrane proteins with 12-membrane-spanning segments that are best known for their ability to transport all types of small molecules including carbohydrates, amino acids, and inorganic ions (25Saier Jr., M.H. Beatty J.T. Goffeau A. Harley K.T. Heijne W.H. Huang S.C. Jack D.L. Jahn P.S. Lew K. Liu J. Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Tseng T.T. Virk P.S. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 257-279PubMed Google Scholar). MFS transporters catalyze either cation symport (either proton or sodium), cation antiport, or uniport (facilitated diffusion). The LplT protein is the first member of the MFS family shown to use a lipid substrate and differs from the lipid transporters described to date in catalyzing facilitated diffusion rather than active transport of phospholipids across the bilayer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sources of supplies were as follows: 9,10-[3H]palmitate (specific activity 60 Ci/mmol) and [32P]orthophosphate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.); 1-acyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (2-acyl-NBD-PtdEtn) (Avanti Polar Lipids); l-[14C]proline (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.); and thin-layer chromatography plates (Analtech). All of the other chemicals were of reagent grade or better.Generation of Deletion Mutants—E. coli strains were derivatives of strain BW25113 (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10970) Google Scholar) and are listed in Table I. Bacteria were usually cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) at 37 °C, and when appropriate, ampicillin (Ap) or kanamycin (Km) was added to the medium to the final concentration of 100 or 25 μg/ml, respectively. Mutations were generated using the methods described by Datsenko and Wanner (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10970) Google Scholar). To prepare competent cells, strain BW25113 carrying plasmid pKD46 (expressing the λ-Red recombinase) was cultured at 30 °C in the presence of ampicillin and 1 mm l-arabinose (28Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the A600 reached 0.6, cells were harvested, washed three times with ice-cold 10% glycerol, and re-suspended in the same solution to 1% original volume. The kanamycin gene from pKD4 was cloned by PCR using gene-specific primers. Primers D-For-Aas and D-Rev-LplT were used to introduce deletions in aas and lplT simultaneously in strain LJ964. After PCR product purification, DpnI digestion, and re-purification by electrophoresis, the PCR products were transformed into competent BW25113 cells by electroporation (Gene Pulser, pulse controller at 200 megohms, capacitance at 250 microfarads, voltage at 25-kV, 0.1-cm chambers). After electroporation, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The Kmr transformants were first purified on Km-LB plates and then grown in LB medium without antibiotics and finally tested for Ap and Km resistance. Replacement of the target gene by the km gene in the Aps Kmr mutants was verified by three PCRs using bacterial DNA as template (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The fadD::km mutation was transferred to strains LJ962 (Δaas), LJ963 (ΔlplT), and LJ964 (Δaas ΔlplT) by transduction with P1vir phage, and the km gene was removed to generate strains LJ965 (ΔfadD Δaas), LJ966 (ΔfadD ΔlplT), and LJ967 (ΔfadD Δaas ΔlplT), respectively.DNA Manipulations and Gene Cloning—Standard methods were used for restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, ligation, and transformation (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA and plasmid isolation, as well as the gel extraction and purification of PCR products, were carried out using Qiagen kits. For gene cloning, the aas and lplT genes were amplified from strain BW25113 chromosomal DNA by PCR. After gel purification, PCR products were treated with SacI and XbaI and then cloned into the SacI and XbaI sites of pBAD28 (30Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar) to generate plasmids pBAD28-aas and pBAD28-lplT. Strain DH5α was used for cloning.Preparation of 2-Acyl-lysophospholipids—2-Acyl-lysophospholipids were prepared by digestion of the corresponding phospholipids with Rhizopus arrhizus lipase essentially as described (31Homma H. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The method was modified as follows. Approximately 2 μmol of phospholipid were dispersed in 0.1 ml of diethylether, 0.1 ml of 0.1 m CaCl2, 0.8 ml of 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 5.6, and 1 mg/ml R. arrhizus lipase (Sigma, catalog number L-4384) were added, and the whole mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking. After incubation, 1 ml of methanol was added to the cooled reaction mixture and the fatty acids liberated were washed three times with 4 ml of petroleum ether/diethylether (1:1, v/v). The lower phase was combined with 0.2 ml of 0.5 m citric acid and extracted with a mixture of 0.5 ml of methanol and 2.2 ml of chloroform. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, and the residue was dissolved in ethanol at the desired concentration. Thin-layer chromatography (Silica Gel G plates developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 65:25:8:3 (v/v)) was used to monitor the reaction, which proved to be completed under the conditions described above. 2-Acyl-lysophospholipid concentrations were estimated according to the method of Stewart (32Stewart J.C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 104: 10-14Crossref Scopus (1518) Google Scholar) using the corresponding phospholipid as a standard.Fatty Acid Incorporation Assays—Cells were grown in M9 minimal medium (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing glycerol (0.4%), casein hydrolysate (0.2%), and Brij-58 (0.5%). When the A600 reached 0.5, [3H]palmitate from a stock solution (1 mCi/ml, 0.16 mm) was added to 1 ml of culture to a final concentration of 0.8 μm and 100-μl aliquots were periodically removed and applied to 0.45-μm Millipore filters. Filters were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7, containing 0.5% Brij-58 and dried. The radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting with 10 ml of Biosafe NA scintillation fluid (Research Products International Corp., Mt. Prospect, IL). The data were normalized to nmol/g dry weight using the specific radioactivity of the palmitic acid, and the number of cells per sample was determined from the optical density using 1.4 A600 = 450 μg dry weight.Preparation and Uptake of Fluorescent 2-Acyl-GPE by Spheroplasts—Strains LJ966 (ΔfadD, ΔlplT), LJ961 (ΔfadD), and LJ965 (Δaas ΔfadD) were grown to a density of 5 × 108 cells/ml in M9 minimal medium (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids, 0.4% glycerol, and 0.0005% thiamin. Spheroplasts of all three strains were made using the basic lysozyme-EDTA method (33Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The spheroplasts were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in the same buffer supplemented with 0.4% glycerol. 2-Dodeceyl-NBD-GPE was added to the spheroplasts to a final concentration of 10 μm and incubated at 37 °C. After 15, 30, and 60 min, 1-ml aliquots (representing 3 × 109 cells) of spheroplasts were removed and harvested by centrifugation. The spheroplasts were washed twice with M9 medium and resuspended in 100 μl of water. The lipids were extracted as described by Bligh and Dryer (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42136) Google Scholar). Lipid samples were spotted onto Silica Gel G thin-layer plates and developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v/v). The phospholipids on the dried plate were visualized using a Typhoon 9200 (Amersham Biosciences) in fluorescence mode with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm (green laser) and an emission filter of 555 nm with a bandwidth of 20 nm. The fluorescent PtdEtn was quantitated with ImageQuant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized to cell number. The fluorescent PtdEtn signal from strain LJ965 (Δaas ΔfadD) was used as the background for calculations.32P Labeling—Bacterial strains were grown in rich medium that contained 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate to a density of 8×108 cells/ml. The cells from 10 ml of culture were harvested, and the lipids were extracted as described by Bligh and Dryer (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42136) Google Scholar). The same total counts of 32P-labeled lipids (105 cpm) were loaded onto Silica Gel G thin-layer plates and developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v/v) to determine the percentage of the total lipids that were acyl-GPE. The dried plate was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for 16 h. The phospholipid bands were visualized using the Typhoon 9200, and acyl-GPE band was quantified with ImageQuant 5.2.RESULTSDistribution of LplT in Bacteria—The transporter classification database includes representatives of all of the functionally characterized transporters as well as many putative transport proteins (35Saier Jr., M.H.

We used the BLAST search tool to screen all of the proteins in the transporter database against the proteins in a database of prokaryotic protein fusions called FusionDB (igs-server.cnrs-mrs.fr/FusionDB/) (37Suhre K. Claverie J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D273-D276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the hits retrieved were proteins that possessed N-terminal domains equivalent to a permease belonging to the MFS and C-terminal domains related to either acyltransferase superfamily (PlsC) or a acyltransferase domain fused with a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase family (ACS) (Fig. 1B and Table II). These proteins are derived from the α, γ, δ, and ϵ subgroups of the proteobacteria. The MFS permease homologues identified in this search comprise a novel family within the MFS, which we term the LplT Family (TC subfamily 2.A.1.42).Table IIBacterial LplT-PlsC-ACS fusion proteins and their homologuesTaxonomyProtein abbreviationOrganismFusionaFusion indicates the expression of a fusion protein containing LplT-PlsC or LplT-PlsC-ACS domains.Protein typebProtein type refers to the numbering in Fig. 1B.Protein sizeGenBank™ accession numberLplTcLplT refers to putative lysophospholipid-facilitated transporter homologues.PlsC/ACSdPlsC/ACS refers to lysophospholipid acyltransferase/acyl-CoA synthetase homologues.LplTcLplT refers to putative lysophospholipid-facilitated transporter homologues.PlsC/ACSdPlsC/ACS refers to lysophospholipid acyltransferase/acyl-CoA synthetase homologues.αBjaBradyrhizobium japonicum+211341134BAC47589BAC47589MloMesorhizobium loti+211371137NP_106114NP_106114MmaMagnetospirillum magnetotacticum+211581158ZP_00054877ZP_00054877RcoRickettsia conorii+211401140AAL03500AAL03500RprRickettsia prowazekii+211521152CAA15063CAA15063RsiRickettsia sibirica+211401140EAA26302EAA26302βBbrBordetella bronchiseptica−4436415NP_890342NP_890344BpaBordetella parapertussis−4436415NP_885522NP_885524BpeBordetella pertussis−4436415NP_882070NP_882068RsoRalstonia solanacearum−4438177NP_519491NP_519489δGsuGeobacter sulfurreducens+211361136AAR36421AAR36421γ1MdeMicrobulbifer degradans+211751175ZP_00067103ZP_00067103PaePseudomonas aeruginosa+3624624AAG06655AAG06655PpuPseudomonas putida+3661661AAN67321AAN67321γ2PsyPseudomonas syringae+3691691ZP_00127629ZP_00127629VchVibrio cholerae+3626626AAF95114AAF95114VvuVibrio vulnificus+3624624AAO11482AAO11482XcaXanthomonas campestris+3640640AAM39809AAM39809γ3EcoEscherichia coli−1397 (ygeD)719 (aas)NP_417312NP_417313PluPhotorhabdus luminescens−1398639NP_928558NP_928557SflShigella flexneri−1396719NP_708624NP_708625StySalmonella typhimurium−1400719NP_461926NP_461927YpeYersinia pestis−1406718NP_404417NP_404418ϵHheHelicobacter hepaticus+211631163AAP76903AAP76903CjeCampylobacter jejuni+211701170CAB73195CAB73195ChlamydiaeCcaChlamydophila caviae+5570570AAP04762AAP04762CmuChlamydia muridarum+5559559AAF38902AAF38902CpnChlamydophila pneumoniae+5569569AAF37905AAF37905CtrChlamydia trachomatis+5559559AAC68245AAC68245a Fusion indicates the expression of a fusion protein containing LplT-PlsC or LplT-PlsC-ACS domains.b Protein type refers to the numbering in Fig. 1B.c LplT refers to putative lysophospholipid-facilitated transporter homologues.d PlsC/ACS refers to lysophospholipid acyltransferase/acyl-CoA synthetase homologues. Open table in a new tab An important connection was the realization that the PlsC-ACS domain associated with the LplT domain in these organisms are homologous to and probably orthologous to the 2-acyl-GPE acyltransferase (Aas) of E. coli (7Jackowski S. Jackson P.D. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hsu L. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13783-13788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, 1). This bifunctional enzyme participates in the 2-acyl-GPE cycle outlined in Fig. 1A. In some bacteria, the bifunctional enzyme is fused to LplT as a single polypeptide (Fig. 1B, 2, and Table II), and in other bacteria, the LplT domain is fused to either a PlsC domain (Fig. 1B, 3, and Table II) or in the same operon as a PlsC domain (Fig. 1B, 4, and Table II). A key fact arising from this analysis was that Gram-negative bacteria possess these LplT-PlsC-ACS-associated systems, whereas Gram-positive bacteria do not. This finding is consistent with the function of LplT in a metabolic cycle responsible for the formation of the major lipoprotein of the outer membrane (Fig. 1A). These strong associations suggested that the LplT protein/domain functions with Aas in the 2-acyl-GPE cycle. In Chlamidiae, LplT is associated with a sequence of unknown function (Fig. 1B, 5, and Table II). This domain, referred to as the Pfam-B24103 domain (39Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was C-terminal to the full-length LplT.Average hydropathy and similarity plots were generated (40Zhai Y. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 285-286PubMed Google Scholar) for all of the LplT permeases and permease domains (data not shown). The hydropathy plot revealed 12 clear peaks of hydrophobicity as anticipated for members of the MFS. The multiple sequence alignments upon which the hydropathy plot was based revealed discrete regions of sequence conservation between members of the LplT family (www-biology.ucsd.edu/~msaier/transport/). The predicted cytoplasmic loop regions between transmembrane segments 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 8 and 9, and 10 and 11 were well conserved within the LplT group. An RK-rich sequence RKFKRK occurred between transmembrane segments 2 and 3 where a related motif RKXGRK2 is found in many MFS permeases with variations from family to family (25Saier Jr., M.H. Beatty J.T. Goffeau A. Harley K.T. Heijne W.H. Huang S.C. Jack D.L. Jahn P.S. Lew K. Liu J. Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Tseng T.T. Virk P.S. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 257-279PubMed Google Scholar). None of these residues was fully conserved in the LplT family members. Between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 and within segment 5 was a motif that was conserved in the LplT group: FGPXKY(G/S)(L/I/V)2PX2LX3NX13G, where underlined residues are fully conserved, X represents any residue, and residues within parentheses represent alternative possibilities at one position. This sequence motif and the greater degree of similarity within the N-terminal halves of these permeases, as compared with their C-terminal halves, are characteristics that define the LplT family.Exogenous Fatty Acid Uptake Defect in lplT Mutants—The function of the LplT family of permeases was investigated using the E. coli model system. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we constructed single, double, and triple knock-out mutants of the fadD, lplT, and aas genes. All of the mutations were deletions that would not alter the expression of other adjacent genes. The lplT and aas genes are located in an operon with lplT as the leading gene. We confirmed using the Aas biochemical assay of isolated inner membranes that the ΔlplT mutants retained the same Aas-specific activity as the wild-type cells and that the Δaas mutants lacked this enzyme activity. In the presence of FadD, exogenous [3H]palmitate label was converted to intracellular acyl-CoA and incorporated into all of the phospholipid classes by the de novo pathway via PlsB and PlsC. This system is a high-capacity pathway that allows a much greater rate of incorporation than the Aas/LplT p"

CK2 also phosphorylates SSRP1 in vitro. Here we extend this work by investigating CK2 regulation of SSRP1 function through phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of SSRP1 by CK2 inhibited the nonspecific DNA-binding activity of SSRP1 and FACT (facilitating chromatin-mediated transcription) complex in vitro. Using a serine/threonine-scanning Auto-spot peptide array coupled with a filter-based kinase assay with synthetic peptides as substrates, we identified serines 510, 657, and 688 as phosphorylation targets of CK2 in vitro. Mutagenesis of the three serines revealed that serine 510 was more important for the regulation of SSRP1 DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, we found that SSRP1 was phosphorylated in cells in response to UV (but not γ) irradiation. These results suggest that CK2 regulates the DNA-binding ability of SSRP1 and that this regulation may be responsive to specific cell stresses.

CK2 is a ubiquitous and evolutionarily conserved kinase. This enzyme is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of two regulatory β subunits (28 kDa) and two catalytic α (42 kDa) or α′ (38 kDa) subunits with the stoichiometry of either α2β2, α′2β2, or αα′β2 as the holoenzyme (1Gietz R.D.

Biochemical and functional analyses of this enzyme reveal that it can phosphorylate a broad spectrum of protein substrates in vitro and regulate a variety of cellular functions including transcription in the nucleus. Consistent with its regulatory role in the nucleus, CK2 associates with a number of chromatin and nuclear matrix proteins in the cell (4Tawfic S. Davis A.T. Faust R.A. Gapany M. Ahmed K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Guo C. Davis A.T. Ahmed K. J. Biol.

One of the mammalian CK2-interacting nuclear proteins is the previously identified DNA-binding protein called SSRP1 (structure-specific recognition protein 1) (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). SSRP1 (named T160 in mice) (8Shirakata M. Huppi K. Usuda S. Okazaki K. Yoshida K. Sakano H. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 5301-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) viability. Sequence analysis reveals that this 80-kDa phosphoprotein possesses several interesting and evolutionarily conserved domains: a large N-terminal region (aa 1-440) (>80% identity between Drosophila and human; 95% identity between Xenopus and human), an acidic domain (aa 440-496) with a limited homology to nucleolin, an HMG box domain (aa 539-614, 60% identity between Drosophila and human) with two flanking basic domains (aa 512-534 and aa 623-640), and a mixed charge domain at the extreme C-terminal region (aa 661-709). In yeast, Pob3 and Nhp6 form a bipartite SSRP1 analog (12Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Pob3 is highly homologous with the N terminus of SSRP1, whereas Nhp6 is an HMG protein resembling the C terminus of SSRP1 (12Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These domains are crucial for the functions of SSRP1. For example, the highly conserved N-terminal region of SSRP1 has been shown to directly interact with its partner, Spt16 (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), forming a tight heterodimer complex (13Orphanides G. Wu W.H. Lane W.S. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This complex was initially identified from human cells as a facilitating chromatin-mediated transcription (FACT) complex to regulate transcriptional elongation with chromatin as a template (14Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). This complex was also shown to probably regulate DNA replication in yeast and Xenopus (10Schlesinger M.B. Formosa T. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1593-1606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Okuhara K. Ohta K.

Furthermore, the C-terminal HMG box is able to bind to DNA nonspecifically as well as to specific structures of DNA, such as DNA modified by the anti-tumor drug cisplatin (9Bruhn S.L. Pil P.M. Essigmann J.M. Housman D.E. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2307-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) or cruciform DNA (16Gariglio M. Ying G.G. Hertel L. Gaboli M. Clerc R.G. Landolfo S. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 472-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, SSRP1 functions as a co-regulator for transcription, and this regulation is executed by interacting with other transcriptional activators such as SRF (17Spencer J.A. Baron M.H. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15686-15693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Drosophila GATA factor (18Shimojima T. Okada M. Nakayama T. Ueda H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Handa H. Hirose S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and p63 through its middle domain (19Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, SSRP1 appears to possess multiple functions in the nucleus. Whether these functions of SSRP1 are regulated by CK2 remains unclear despite the fact that CK2 associates with SSRP1 in a protein kinase complex (20Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As an initial step to address this question, we started to explore potential regulation of SSRP1 function by CK2 through phosphorylation. This idea originated from our previous findings that a UV irradiation-responsive p53 serine 392 kinase complex contains SSRP1, Spt16, and CK2 (20Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and CK2 efficiently phosphorylates SSRP1 (but not Spt16) in vitro (20Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Also, we found that the assembly of this ternary complex appears to be induced after UV irradiation of cells (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with our findings is that CK2 was also shown to phosphorylate maize SSRP1 at the HMG region in vitro, and this phosphorylation seemed to induce the recognition of UV irradiation-damaged DNA by SSRP1 in vitro (21Krohn N.M. Stemmer C. Fojan P. Grimm R. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12710-12715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although SSRP1 possesses a number of CK2 consensus sites, it is still unclear which amino acids CK2 specifically phosphorylates and whether phosphorylation of these potential residues regulates the ability of SSRP1 to bind to DNA. Also, it is unknown whether SSRP1 phosphorylation is responsive to UV irradiation in cells. Hence, we performed a series of biochemical analyses to address these specific questions. As detailed below, we show that SSRP1 is phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues in cells, and that one or more target sites are indeed induced by UV (but not γ) irradiation. Also, CK2 phosphorylation of SSRP1 that is either alone or in the FACT complex inhibits the ability of SSRP1 to bind to nonmodified linear DNA in vitro. Employing a serine/threonine-scanning Auto-spot peptide array technique coupled with a CK2 kinase assay, we identified serines 510, 657, and 688 of SSRP1 as CK2 targets in vitro. Mutagenesis of the three serines revealed that serine 510 might be critical for regulation of SSRP1·DNA binding in vitro. These results indicate that CK2 can regulate the ability of SSRP1 to bind to nonmodified DNA by specifically phosphorylating serine 510 and suggest that these amino acids, although not residing in the DNA-binding HMG domain, may play a critical role in regulating SSRP1 function.

Plasmids and Antibodies—pET24a-CK2α′, pET24a-CK2β, pET24a-SSRP1, and pGEX-KG-C-SSRP1 (aa 471-709) plasmids were as described previously (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The pGEX-KG-C-SSRP1 (aa 471-709) serine→alanine mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). Polyclonal anti-SSRP1 and anti-Spt16 antibodies were generated as described previously (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Histidine-tagged proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), as described previously (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and eluted with glutathione, followed by dialysis against BC100 buffer. Purification of the FLAG·FACT Complex—FLAG-SSRP1 HEK293 cells (1 × 108 cells) were cultured in suspension and harvested for nuclear extracts as described previously (22Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were loaded onto a phosphocellulose (P11) column and step-eluted at 0.1, 0.35, 0.5, and 1.0 m KCl. The 0.5 m KCl fraction was dialyzed against BC100 buffer and incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma). After washing rigorously, the immunoprecipitate was eluted from the beads with FLAG peptide, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with colloidal blue. The FACT complex purified from the 0.5 m fraction was used for electrophoresis gel mobility shift assays. Purification of the CK2 Kinase Complex—An equal molecular ratio of highly purified His-CK2α′ and His-CK2β (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was incubated on ice for 1 h and run on a Superdex 200 (3.2/30) column (Smart HPLC, Pharmacia Corporation). The kinase-containing fractions were pooled and used for in vitro kinase assays. In Vivo32P-Labeled Inorganic Phosphate and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—HeLa cells were either untreated, γ-irradiated (14 gray), or UVB-irradiated (1200 J/m2). Three hours after irradiation, 32P inorganic phosphate was added to 375 μCi/ml, along with 500 nm phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 3 h. The cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation. After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by autoradiography. The radioactive SSRP1 bands were sliced from the gel and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis as described previously (23van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After extraction from the gel, the samples, normalized by counts/min, were loaded onto a cellulose thin-layer chromatography plate (Fisher Scientific), which was subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis. Signals were detected by autoradiography. Electrophoresis Gel Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described previously (20Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Proteins, as indicated in each figure legend, were incubated with a 3′ end-labeled 87-bp DNA fragment (5000 cycles/min, 0.1-1.0 ng of DNA/assay) derived from the p21waf1/cip1 promoter (24Zeng X. Levine A.J. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6681-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 4.5% nondenatured gel. Protein·DNA complexes were detected by autoradiography. EMSA for SSRP1 was also carried out with different sizes and sequences of DNA. The results were similar to what are shown in this study (data not shown). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Radioactive in vitro kinase assays were performed with [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Substrates were either 50 ng of His-SSRP1 or 100 ng of GST-C-SSRP1. For the kinase reaction that was coupled with EMSA, the reaction volume was 10 μl, and 1 mm unlabeled ATP, instead of [γ-32P]ATP, was used. In Vitro Kinase Assay on Peptide Arrays—Peptide arrays were synthesized on cellulose membranes with an Auto-Spot Robot ASP 222 (AbiMed, Langenfeld, Germany) as described previously (25Tegge W.J. Frank R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays on the peptide arrays with our purified recombinant CK2 complexes were also performed as described previously (26Carnegie G.K. Smith F.D. McConnachie G. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 889-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—CD analyses were performed on an automated AVIV 215 spectrometer at 25 °C as described previously (27Yabuta Y. Subbian E. Oiry C. Shinde U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15246-15251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All the protein concentrations were maintained at 0.1 mg/ml. Spectra were taken between 190-260 nm using a 0.5-mm path-length cuvette. SSRP1 Phosphorylation Is Induced by UV (but Not by γ) Irradiation—Our previous findings that the CK2-SSRP1 interaction increased after UV irradiation and that CK2 efficiently phosphorylated SSRP1 in vitro prompted us to examine whether SSRP1 phosphorylation is induced by UV irradiation in cells. To this end, human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were irradiated with either UVB or γ rays for 6 h, including 3 h of labeling with [32P]orthophosphate. The cells were harvested for co-immunoprecipitation and 32P-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1A, irradiation of the cells with either UV or γ rays did not change the steady-state level of SSRP1 (upper panel). Interestingly, and consistent with our previous work (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), 32P-labeled SSRP1 increased 2.4-fold specifically in response to UV (but not γ) irradiation (Fig. 1A, lower panel), suggesting that the UV irradiation-inducible CK2·SSRP1 complex might also lead to inducible SSRP1 phosphorylation by CK2. To determine which amino acids are phosphorylated after UV irradiation, the 32P-labeled SSRP1 bands in Fig. 1A were gel-purified for phosphoamino acid analysis. Greater than 95% of phosphorylated amino acids in SSRP1 were serines, ∼5% were threonines, and none was tyrosine (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that SSRP1 is indeed phosphorylated mainly at serines in cells and that this phosphorylation is UV irradiation-responsive. CK2 Phosphorylation of SSRP1 Inhibits the Ability of SSRP1 and the FACT Complex to Bind to Nonmodified DNA in Vitro—To determine whether CK2-mediated phosphorylation of SSRP1 affects its DNA-binding activity, we compared a purified FACT complex containing both FLAG-SSRP1 and Spt16 from the FLAG-SSRP1 expressing HEK293 cells versus recombinant histidine-tagged SSRP1. The purity of FACT and His-SSRP1 is shown in Fig. 2A (left panel) and Fig. 2B (right panel), respectively. Recombinant CK2 α and β′ subunits were either purified to homogeneity and reconstituted into a heterotetrameric complex as described previously (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or purchased from Promega. With these purified proteins, we carried out a set of electrophoresis gel mobility shift assays using 32P-labeled 87-bp oligomers digested from the pWaf-1-Δ50 plasmid (24Zeng X. Levine A.J. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6681-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as probes. As shown in Fig. 2A (right panel), FACT bound to DNA efficiently in vitro as expected (28Yarnell A.T. Oh S. Reinberg D. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25736-25741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This FACT·DNA complex was indeed formed with SSRP1 and Spt16, as both anti-SSRP1 and anti-Spt16 antibodies super-shifted the complex (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7). Interestingly, CK2 reduced the FACT·DNA complex in the presence (but not in the absence) of 1 mm ATP, suggesting that this inhibition may be phosphorylation-dependent. Supporting this assumption is the fact that CK2 phosphorylated SSRP1 (but not Spt16) in FACT in vitro (20Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To verify whether the reduction of the FACT·DNA complex formation is through CK2 phosphorylation of SSRP1, we conducted EMSA using purified His-SSRP1. As expected (9Bruhn S.L. Pil P.M. Essigmann J.M. Housman D.E. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2307-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), recombinant SSRP1 efficiently bound to DNA (Fig. 2B) under the same conditions as those used for FACT (Fig. 2A), and the anti-SSRP1 antibody also supershifted this complex (Fig. 2B). Again, CK2 completely inhibited the formation of SSRP1·DNA complex in the presence (but not in the absence) of ATP (Fig. 2C). This inhibition was not because of the change of SSRP1 level, as its level stayed the same after incubation (data not shown). The elimination of SSRP1·DNA complexes by CK2 was closely related to SSRP1 phosphorylation by this kinase, as 32P labeling of SSRP1 was detected in a CK2 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that CK2 can phosphorylate SSRP1 and thus prevent SSRP1, either alone or in the FACT complex, from binding to nonmodified DNA in vitro. SSRP1 Phosphorylates the C-terminal Domain of SSRP1 and Inhibits Its Ability to Bind to DNA in Vitro—It was shown previously (28Yarnell A.T. Oh S. Reinberg D. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25736-25741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that SSRP1 binds to DNA through its C-terminal HMG-containing domain. Next we wanted to determine whether CK2 inhibits the DNA-binding activity of SSRP1 by phosphorylating the C terminus of SSRP1, although the middle domain of SSRP1 was also phosphorylated by CK2 (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). GST C-terminal SSRP1 (aa 471-709), encompassing the HMG box, was purified as described previously (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to homogeneity (Fig. 3A) for EMSA. As anticipated (28Yarnell A.T. Oh S. Reinberg D. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25736-25741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), this GST-C-SSRP1 fragment bound to DNA in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3B). Again, this DNA-binding ability was inhibited by CK2 when only ATP was present (Fig. 3C). This inhibition was dose-dependent (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6) and associated with phosphorylation of the C terminus of SSRP1 by CK2, as detected when [γ-32P]ATP, instead of unlabeled ATP, was used (see Fig. 6D and data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrated that CK2 inhibits the DNA-binding activity of SSRP1 by phosphorylating its C-terminal domain.Fig. 6Phosphorylation of GST-C-SSRP1-S3A (but not GST-C-SSRP1-S2A) by CK2 fails to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of this protein. A, phosphorylation of GST-C-SSRP1 by CK2 inhibits its DNA-binding activity. The same kinase/EMSA assay was conducted as described in the legend to Fig. 3, and 50 ng of GST-C-SSRP1 was used. B, phosphorylation of GST-C-SSRP1-S3A by CK2 failed to inhibit its DNA-binding ability. The kinase/EMSA assay on the triple mutant of GST-C-SSRP1 was conducted under the same conditions as those for wild type GST-C-SSRP1 in A. C, phosphorylation of GST-C-SSRP1-S2A by CK2 still inhibited its DNA-binding ability. The kinase/EMSA assay on the double mutant of GST-C-SSRP1 was conducted under the same conditions as those for wild type GST-C-SSRP1 in A. D, GST-C-SSRP1-S3A is partially phosphorylated by CK2. In vitro radioactive kinase assays were carried out under the same conditions as used for the EMSA reactions in A and B. The 32P-labeled SSRP1 fragment signals were quantified and plotted in a graph shown in E using imaging software.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CK2 Phosphorylates Serines 510, 657, and 688 of SSRP1 in Vitro—Although the C terminus of SSRP1 was phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro (Fig. 6 and data not shown), it was challenging to determine which amino acids are CK2 target sites. There are 46 serines and four threonines in this region of SSRP1, seven of which exist in the HMG box (Fig. 4). Also, 20 of these potential phosphorylation sites display a similarity to the CK2 consensus sequence ((S/T)XX(D/E) or (S/T)(D/E)). Moreover, mass spectrometry of phosphorylated SSRP1 failed to map CK2 sites (data not shown) mainly because of the relatively low efficiency of SSRP1 phosphorylation (<30%) in vitro and dense distribution of phosphorylation target residues in the middle and C-terminal regions of SSRP1 (Fig. 4 and data not shown). To surmount these obstacles, we employed an Auto-spot peptide array technique coupled with a filter-based kinase assay (25Tegge W.J. Frank R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar, 26Carnegie G.K. Smith F.D. McConnachie G. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 889-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Using this approach with pairs of synthetic wild type and corresponding serine→alanine mutant 10mer peptides spotted on a nitrocellulose filter as substrates, we identified three serines as CK2 sites. As shown in Fig. 4, peptide pair 10 (note, each pair of peptides has a wild type and a serine→alanine mutant peptide), encompassing serine 510, peptide pair 15 with serines 657 and 659, and peptide pair 19 with serines 685 and 688, was phosphorylated by CK2. By contrast, phosphorylation of the peptides by CK2 was markedly reduced when their corresponding serine→alanine mutants were used as substrates. Although peptides 15 and 19 harbored two serines in each case, only the S657A mutation of peptide 15 (in comparison with peptide 16 that contains S657A and S659A) or the S688A of peptide 19 had reduced phosphorylation (Fig. 4, right column), suggesting that serines 657 and 688 are the CK2 sites (of note, the residual signals of the mutant S510A-, S657A-, or S657A/S659A-containing peptides 10, 15, and 16 might be due to less stringent washing, as these peptides should not be phosphorylated). Consistently, the three sites also display a similarity to the CK2 consensus sequence (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, all of these three serines reside outside of the HMG domain of SSRP1 (Fig. 4, lower panel). Although some of the synthetic peptides might not serve as ideal substrates for CK2 in this assay, perhaps because of improper folding (thereby giving false negative results), this study at least identifies serines 510, 657, and 688 as CK2 phosphorylation sites for further analysis. Serine 510 (but Not Serines 657 and 688) Plays a Role in CK2 Regulation of SSRP1 DNA-binding Activity—To investigate whether phosphorylation of SSRP1 at serines 510, 657, and 688 by CK2 is important for regulating the DNA-binding activity of SSRP1, we generated an SSRP1 C-terminal triple mutant S3A (denoting S510A/S657A/S688A) and a double mutant S2A (denoting S657A/S688A) in the GST-C-SSRP1 fusion protein using a mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. These mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown). These GST fusion proteins and its wild type counterpart were purified to homogeneity as shown in Fig. 5A. To ensure that these mutant proteins are still able to bind to DNA, we carried out EMSA with the purified proteins, as described in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 5B, at the same concentrations, the wild type and two mutant GST-C-SSRP1 proteins were able to bind to DNA, although the DNA-binding ability of the mutant proteins was a bit weaker. CD analysis of the wild type and mutant proteins showed that these proteins displayed a similar secondary structure (Fig. 5C). Next, we performed a set of EMSA experiments to determine whether these three serines are crucial for CK2 phosphorylation of the SSRP1 C terminus and thus its regulation of SSRP1 DNA-binding activity. Again phosphorylation of the GST-SSRP1-C terminus by CK2 markedly inhibited the formation of SSRP1·DNA complexes (Fig. 6A). By striking contrast, the triple mutant GST-C-SSRP1-S3A was still able to bind to DNA in the presence of CK2 and ATP (Fig. 6B), suggesting that substitution of the three serines by alanines may prevent CK2 phosphorylation of the C terminus of SSRP1 at these residues and thus rescue CK2-mediated inhibition of SSRP1 DNA binding. Consistent with this assumption was that phosphorylation of the triple mutant GST-C-SSRP1-S3A by CK2 was reduced to ∼30% of that of the wild type protein (Fig. 6, D and E). Although the triple mutant was still phosphorylated by CK2 (Fig. 6D), the remaining phosphorylation did not appear to efficiently block the DNA-binding activity of the C terminus of SSRP1 (Fig. 6B). To further determine which serine is more critical for the inhibitory effect of CK2 on SSRP1 DNA-binding activity, we conducted the same EMSA assay with the SSRP1 C-terminal double mutant S2A (S657A/S688A). We found that this double mutant was unable to prevent the inhibition of CK2-mediated phosphorylation on SSRP1 DNA-binding activity (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results suggest that serine 510 may play a crucial role in mediating CK2 regulation of SSRP1 DNA-binding function. It has been shown that CK2 forms a complex with SSRP1 and Spt16 in cells and phosphorylates SSRP1 (but not Spt16) in vitro (20Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Little is known about the regulation of SSRP1 function by CK2. As an initial step to understand the role of CK2 in human SSRP1 regulation, we have performed a series of biochemical experiments using purified proteins. We found that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of SSRP1 at its HMG-containing C-terminal region led to a reduction of SSRP1·DNA binding (Fig. 3). This inhibition occurred when either FACT or recombinant SSRP1 was used as the substrate of CK2 (Figs. 2). Moreover, by means of the Auto-spot peptide array/filter kinase approach, we identified serines 510, 657, and 688 as CK2 target sites in vitro (Fig. 4). Replacing all three serines (but not merely the serine 657 and 688 residues together) with alanines alleviated the inhibition of SSRP1 DNA-binding activity by CK2 (Figs. 5 and 6), indicating that serine 510 is more critical for regulating SSRP1 DNA-binding activity. Consistent with these results is that CK2 was also previously reported to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of maize HMGB proteins through phosphorylation (29Stemmer C. Schwander A. Bauw G. Fojan P. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hence, our results demonstrate that CK2 can phosphorylate the serines outside of the HMG box domain and thereby inhibit its ability to interact with nonmodified DNA. Intriguingly, phosphorylation of maize SSRP1 by CK2 was recently shown to enhance the ability of the SSRP1 protein to bind to UV irradiation-damaged DNA in vitro (21Krohn N.M. Stemmer C. Fojan P. Grimm R. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12710-12715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although specific phosphorylation amino acids were not identified and mutated. This finding, along with our current study, suggests that inhibiting the nonspecific DNA-binding activity of SSRP1 by CK2 would, in effect, increase the specificity of SSRP1 for UV irradiation-damaged DNA. In this scenario, DNA-damaging agents, such as UV irradiation, would signal through these molecules. Because SSRP1, together with Spt16, often associates with chromatin for its regulatory role in transcription and replication (10Schlesinger M.B. Formosa T.

Biol. 2003; 23: 8323-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), it is also likely that by dissociating SSRP1 from nonspecific DNA sequences, CK2 may enhance its ability to bind to specific structures of chromatin, where transcription, replication, or DNA repair may take place. Alternatively and conversely, by phosphorylating certain residues of SSRP1, CK2 may negatively regulate transcription or replication in response to UV irradiation-caused DNA damage. It is known that UV irradiation often causes global inhibition of transcription or replication (33Takeda S. Naruse S. Yatani R. Nature. 1967; 213: 696-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Yet, detailed mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive, although one general thought is that intrastrand cross-linking of neighboring bases in DNA caused by UV irradiation may block elongation of transcription or replication. Given that SSRP1/Spt16 has been proposed to be functional in transcriptional elongation and replication (10Schlesinger M.B. Formosa T.

Biol. 2003; 23: 8323-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), one mechanism would be that CK2 may inhibit this function by phosphorylating SSRP1 and thus preventing it from associating with chromatin, consequently leading to transcriptional stall or replication pause in response to UV irradiation. Consistent with this speculation is that the assembly of the CK2·SSRP1·Spt16 complex, as well as phosphorylation of SSRP1, is induced in response to UV irradiation (Fig. 1) (20Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that by dissociating SSRP1 or FACT from chromatin, CK2 would form a kinase complex with these proteins, which in turn assist CK2 in selectively phosphorylating and activating p53 in response to UV irradiation (7Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y.

In sum, our finding, as described here, suggests a potential mechanism underlying the regulation of SSRP1 function by CK2 in response to UV irradiation.

https://openalex.org/W1981433912,"Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. The HTLV-I protein Tax is well known as a transcriptional transactivator and inducer of cellular transformation. However, it is also known that extracellular Tax induces the production and release of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, which have adverse effects on cells of the central nervous system. The cellular process by which Tax exits the cell into the extracellular environment is currently unknown. In most cell types, Tax has been shown to localize primarily to the nucleus. However, Tax has also been found to accumulate in the cytoplasm. The results contained herein begin to characterize the process of Tax secretion from the cell. Specifically, cytoplasmic Tax was demonstrated to localize to organelles associated with the cellular secretory process including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Additionally, it was demonstrated that full-length Tax was secreted from both baby hamster kidney cells and a human kidney tumor cell line, suggesting that Tax enters the secretory pathway in a leaderless manner. Tax secretion was partially inhibited by brefeldin A, suggesting that Tax migrated from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. In addition, combined treatment of Tax-transfected BHK-21 cells with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin resulted in a small increase in the amount of Tax secreted, suggesting that a fraction of cytoplasmic Tax was present in the regulated secretory pathway. These studies begin to provide a link between Tax localization to the cytoplasm, the detection of Tax in the extracellular environment, its possible role as an extracellular effector molecule, and a potential role in neurodegenerative disease associated with HTLV-I infection. Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. The HTLV-I protein Tax is well known as a transcriptional transactivator and inducer of cellular transformation. However, it is also known that extracellular Tax induces the production and release of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, which have adverse effects on cells of the central nervous system. The cellular process by which Tax exits the cell into the extracellular environment is currently unknown. In most cell types, Tax has been shown to localize primarily to the nucleus. However, Tax has also been found to accumulate in the cytoplasm. The results contained herein begin to characterize the process of Tax secretion from the cell.

The HTLV-I transactivating oncoprotein Tax plays an integral role in productive viral replication and disease progression. Tax has been studied with respect to its interaction with a number of cellular signaling pathways and transcription factor families, including activating transcription factor/cAMP-response element-binding protein and NF-κB (1Jeang K.T. Boros I. Brady J. Radonovich M. Khoury G. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4499-4509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zhao L.J. Giam C.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 721-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, Tax enhances cAMP-response element-binding protein binding within the HTLV-I long terminal repeat, which in turn enhances transcription of viral mRNA (1Jeang K.T. Boros I. Brady J. Radonovich M. Khoury G. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4499-4509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to the NF-κB pathway, cytoplasmic Tax acts by binding directly to the IKK-γ subunit of the IKK complex. This association induces the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, the inhibitor of NF-κB, thereby allowing the NF-κB complex to migrate to the nucleus and enhance gene expression (6Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar, 7Jin D.Y. Giordano V. Kibler K.V. Nakano H. Jeang K.T. J. Biol.

The pathogenesis of both ATL and HAM/TSP is coupled, at least in part, to the biological activity of Tax (9Wessner R. Yao J. Wigdahl B. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 10-13PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yao J. Wigdahl B. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D138-D168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Grant C. Barmak K. Alefantis T. Yao J. Jacobson S. Wigdahl B. J. Cell.

Tax has been demonstrated to be a key player in the malignant transformation of HTLV-I-infected T cells. In addition, several of the pathogenic processes associated with HAM/TSP have been postulated to occur as a result of the extracellular activity of Tax. First, in some individuals with HAM/TSP, Tax has been shown to promote hyperstimulation of the immune system. Specifically, these individuals harbor an extremely large number of Tax-reactive CD8+ T cells that reside in the cerebrospinal fluid (14Kubota R. Nagai M. Kawanishi T. Osame M. Jacobson S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1705-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, in some HTLV-I-infected individuals, antibodies directed against Tax also cross-react with the neuronal protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein-A1, implicating the process of molecular mimicry in the progression of HAM/TSP (15Levin M.C. Lee S.M. Morcos Y. Brady J. Stuart J. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 1514-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Levin M.C. Lee S.M. Kalume F. Morcos Y. Dohan Jr., F.C. Hasty K.A. Callaway J.C. Zunt J. Desiderio D. Stuart J.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Finally, several studies have examined the effects of extracellular Tax on cells of the central nervous system (CNS). For example, microglial cells were previously shown to release tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in response to extracellular Tax (17Dhib-Jalbut S. Hoffman P.M. Yamabe T. Sun D. Xia J. Eisenberg H. Bergey G. Ruscetti F.W. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Additionally, neuronal cells were shown to release TNF-α in response to extracellular Tax (18Cowan E.P. Alexander R.K. Daniel S. Kashanchi F. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6982-6989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these cytokines has been demonstrated to induce severe abnormalities in the CNS including, but not limited to, dysfunction of oligodendrocytes leading to demyelination of neurons, a pathology that is also observed in HAM/TSP patients. There have been two cell types demonstrated to harbor HTLV-I proviral DNA in vitro and in vivo: the T lymphocyte and the astrocyte. Clearly, T lymphocytes represent the most commonly infected cell type and primary site of productive viral replication. Consequently, this cell type would represent an obvious source of extracellular Tax, since it infiltrates the CNS during the course of neurologic disease and has been associated with CNS lesions characteristic of HAM/TSP. Additionally, astrocytes have been demonstrated to harbor HTLV-I proviral DNA and exhibit an altered physiology after co-culture with HTLV-I-infected T cells (19Szymocha R. Brisson C. Bernard A. Akaoka H. Belin M.F. Giraudon P. J. Neurovirol. 2000; 6: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Szymocha R. Akaoka H. Dutuit M. Malcus C. Didier-Bazes M. Belin M.F. Giraudon P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6433-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Szymocha R. Akaoka H. Brisson C. Beurton-Marduel P. Chalon A. Bernard A. Didier-Bazes M. Belin M.F. Giraudon P. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that both T lymphocytes and astrocytes may serve as a source of extracellular Tax in the CNS. In 1990, Lindholm et al. (22Lindholm P.F. Marriott S.J. Gitlin S.D. Bohan C.A. Brady J.N. New Biol. 1990; 2: 1034-1043PubMed Google Scholar) addressed the possibility that Tax may be secreted from HTLV-I-infected T lymphocytes. Tax was detected in the extracellular environment after purification of medium derived from MT-2 cell cultures, an HTLV-I-infected CD4+ T lymphocyte cell line (22Lindholm P.F. Marriott S.J. Gitlin S.D. Bohan C.A. Brady J.N. New Biol. 1990; 2: 1034-1043PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent release of Tax from MT-2 cells was most likely not the result of cell lysis or apoptosis, because the HTLV-I glycoprotein p24 could not be detected in the medium. Despite these interesting results, many questions still remain concerning the source of extracellular Tax and how the protein exits the cell. In this report, we have investigated the secretion of Tax utilizing a cell biology system that has been previously used to examine the general properties of protein secretion. To this end, the baby hamster kidney (BHK-21Szymocha R. Akaoka H. Brisson C. Beurton-Marduel P. Chalon A. Bernard A. Didier-Bazes M. Belin M.F. Giraudon P. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) cell line was utilized for several reasons, including its previous use in numerous studies examining the biological process of protein secretion, its high transfection efficiency, and its ease of use in microscopic analysis. In addition to this, 293T cells were selected to study Tax secretion because of their human origin and because they were of kidney origin and therefore physiologically consistent with the BHK-21 cell line. Furthermore, the 293T cell line has previously shown utility in protein secretion studies and other microscopic analyses and is also transfected with high efficiency in many experimental systems. In the experimental analysis contained herein, Tax was demonstrated to co-localize with several cytoplasmic organelles associated with exocytosis including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex (GC), suggesting that Tax may migrate through these two organelles during the course of secretion. Second, time lapse video microscopy demonstrated that a large fraction of Tax localized to the cytoplasm and moved in a manner consistent with that of microtubule-associated proteins or secretory vesicles. Third, Tax was purified from the medium of Tax-transfected BHK-21 and 293T cells, strongly suggesting that Tax was secreted from these cell types. Fourth, Tax was shown to be secreted as a full-length protein, suggesting that it entered the cellular secretory pathway in a leaderless and uncleaved manner, a result similar to several other secreted proteins, including HIV-1 Tat, IL-1β, and basic fibroblast growth factor (23Rubartelli A. Cozzolino F. Talio M. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 24Chang H.C. Samaniego F. Nair B.C. Buonaguro L. Ensoli B. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Finally, a small increase in Tax secretion was detected after combined treatment of cells with the secretagogues phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, indicating that at least a fraction of Tax was present in the regulated secretory pathway. Cell Culture—BHK-21 and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). All growth media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and kanamycin at 0.04 mg/ml each), l-glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), and sodium bicarbonate (0.05%). Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 at 90% relative humidity. Construction of Plasmids Encoding Fusion Proteins and Purification of Recombinant DNA—Full-length Tax cDNA coding sequence was cloned into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using PCR and Tax-specific primers, yielding a fusion protein in which yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was fused to the carboxyl terminus of Tax. Tax and Tax mutant protein coding sequences were cloned into pIRES-EGFP (Clontech) using PCR and the Tax-specific primers that also encoded FLAG (DDDDK) or His6 (HHHHHH) tags. Mutation of FLAG-Tax-His6 to FLAG-Tax-COPII-His6 (330DHE332 to 330AHA332) was performed using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid DNA used for screening and automated sequencing was isolated using the Concert miniprep system as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence of all plasmid constructs was confirmed by automated sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analysis using Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Plasmid DNA used for transient transfections was isolated using the HiSpeed Plasmid Midi DNA purification system as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Construction of FLAG-Tax-His6 (FTH6) Plasmid and Purification of FTH6 Protein—To facilitate the immunoprecipitation and quantitative estimation of secreted Tax, FLAG and His tags were added to the Tax. The FTH6 plasmid was constructed by inserting the FLAG DNA coding sequence at the 5′ end of the Tax-His6 gene in the pTax-His6 expression plasmid provided by Dr. Chao-Zen Giam (Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD) (25Zhao L.J. Giam C.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11445-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Insertion of the FLAG coding sequence was performed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). FTH6 was expressed in Escherichia coli (HB101) for 14 h, after which cells were pelleted in a JA-17 rotor (5000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). FTH6 protein was purified using the His-bind purification system as described by the manufacturer (Novagen, Madison, WI). Purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE (180 V, 45 min) and was stained using the Silver Stain Plus reagent (Bio-Rad). The concentration of FTH6 protein was determined using densitometry with subsequent comparison against a set of silver-stained low range molecular weight marker proteins (Bio-Rad). The presence of both the FLAG and His6 tags was verified by Western immunoblot analysis. Transient Transfections—For co-localization of Tax-YFP with cytoplasmic organelles and time lapse analysis of Tax-YFP cytoplasmic localization, BHK-21 cells (1 × 106) were plated onto either 35-mm glass bottom tissue culture plates (MatTek, Ashland, MA) or 40-mm glass coverslips (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (6 μl/reaction; Invitrogen), 2.4 μg of Tax-YFP DNA, and 1.0 μg of either pECFP-N1, pECFP-Nuc, pECFP-ER, or pECFP-Golgi (Clontech). For immunofluorescence microscopy of Tax secretion constructs and phenotypic determination of apoptosis and necrosis, BHK-21 cells were plated in an 8-well chamber slide (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed using 1.0 μg of DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (1.0 μl). For protein secretion studies, BHK-21 or 293T cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate 24 h prior to transfection. For Western immunoblot analyses, BHK-21 cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate 24 h prior to transfection. Transfections of BHK-21 and 293T cells were performed in 6-well plates using 2.4 μg of DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 with a protocol optimized for each cell line (Invitrogen). Microscopic Analyses—Transfected cells were prepared for microscopy ∼24 h post-transfection. For imaging of live cells transfected with Tax-YFP along with either CFP-nucleus (CFP-Nuc), CFP-ER, or CFP-Golgi, no preparation was performed prior to microscopic analysis. For imaging of Tax secretion constructs, medium was aspirated, and cells were washed once with 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were fixed for 30 min with paraformaldehyde (4%) and washed twice with PBS for 5 min. Cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.5%) in PBS for 15 min and again washed twice for 5 min with PBS. FLAG epitope constructs were immunostained using an anti-FLAG-Cy3 antibody (Sigma). Nucleic acids were stained with DAPI (100 pm, 2 min; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) diluted in PBS. Coverslips were added along with Fluormount-G mounting medium (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL). Cells were visualized using an Olympus IX-81 automated microscope in conjunction with the appropriate filter cubes for visualizing enhanced YFP and ECFP or visualizing EGFP, DAPI, and Cy3. Images were obtained with a Cook CCD Sensicam digital camera controlled by Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). All components of the microscopy system were controlled using an Apple Macintosh G4 dual 1-GHz processor computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Raw fluorescent images were deconvolved (no neighbors method) using Slidebook. For time lapse microscopy, cells were plated onto round glass coverslips (60 mm) and transfected as described under “Transient Transfections.” After transfection (8 h), the coverslip containing the transfected cells was inserted into the FCS2 live cell chamber system (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) and incubated at 37 °C. Some cells were treated with either the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodozole (50 μm, 90 min; Sigma) or the kinesin inhibitor monastrol (100 mm, 4 h; Sigma) just prior to insertion into the live cell chamber system. The live cell chamber was then attached to the Olympus IX-81 microscopy system as outlined above. Time lapse images (×60) were obtained at intervals of 3 s as guided by the Slidebook software system. Detection of Native Tax and FTH6 in Cell Culture Medium—BHK-21 cells (1 × 107) were seeded in a 100-mm culture dish and transfected (in triplicate) with pCMV4, pCMV-Tax, or pCMV-FTH6 using Lipofectamine 2000 as described under “Transient Transfections.” After transfection (24 h), fresh medium containing protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin (1.0 μg/ml each; Sigma) was added. After an additional 24 h, the medium was collected and subjected to centrifugation (600 × g, 5 min) to pellet cell debris. Cells remaining in culture were washed once with ice-cold PBS (1.0 ml) and lysed at 4 °C with shaking for 10 min using M-PER extraction reagent supplemented with HALT protease inhibitor (Pierce). Both cell lysate and supernatant were concentrated using a nanosep 10K liquid concentrator (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). Total protein in the supernatant was precipitated by the addition of ice cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min on ice. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein pellet was washed twice with 100% acetone (10-min incubation on ice), dried, and resuspended in Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates were diluted 1:2 with sample buffer. All of the samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and loaded onto a 12% Tris-HCl SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and subjected to electrophoresis (125 V, 90 min). Samples were then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for 2 h (100 mA). Western blot analysis was performed at room temperature by first blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin dissolved in a solution of PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST; 1 h) and then rinsed once with PBST for 10 min and twice with PBS for 5 min. Blots were then incubated for 1 h with a 1:50 dilution (PBST plus 1% bovine serum albumin) of anti-Tax monoclonal antibody (TAB 170), a generous gift from Dr. Fatah Kashanchi (George Washington University, Washington, D. C.). After primary antibody incubation, blots were washed as before and incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution (PBST plus 1% bovine serum albumin) of Protein G-peroxidase (Sigma) for 1 h. After the final wash, blots were developed using Western Lightening (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film. Purification of Secreted FTH6—Six plates (35 mm) of BHK-21 cells were transfected with each plasmid construct used (pIRES-EGFP and FTH6) as described under “Transient Transfections.” After transfection, medium in each well was replaced with new medium containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin (1.0 μg/ml; Sigma). After 24 h, the medium (12 ml/sample) was collected and subjected to centrifugation (600 × g, 1 min) to pellet all cell debris. Medium was then transferred to a 15-ml conical tube, and 250 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) was added. Samples were then placed on an end-over-end rotor overnight at 4 °C. Tubes were subjected to centrifugation (400 × g, 5 min), and the medium was removed. Agarose beads were washed three times (500 μl) with 1× wash buffer (Sigma), resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer (Sigma), and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The presence of FTH6 was assayed using Western immunoblot analysis as described above using either anti-GFP antibody ab-290 (Abcam Ltd.), the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), or the anti-His6-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Sigma) as primary antibody and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation of Tax Secretion by ELISA—BHK-21 cells were transfected with FTH6 as described above, and 24 h post-transfection, new medium containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin (1 μg/ml; Sigma) was added. After an additional 24 h, the medium was collected and subjected to centrifugation (16,000 × g, 1 min) to pellet all cell debris. The supernatant was separated into two fractions. One fraction (100 μl) was utilized for the detection of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using the CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). The other fraction (1 ml) was concentrated to a volume of 200 μl using a nanosep 10K liquid concentrator (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells remaining in the culture well were washed once with ice-cold PBS (1 ml) and lysed on ice for 10 min using 200 μl of M-PER extraction reagent supplemented with HALT protease inhibitor (Pierce). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min). Cell extract and corresponding concentrated medium were loaded onto a 96-well plate precoated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Purified FTH6 protein was also loaded onto a 96-well plate as a series of quantification reference standards (1000, 100, 10, and 1 ng/well). The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, at which time each well was washed three times with 300 μl of PBS with 1% Tween (PBST). A solution of PBST and anti-His6-horseradish peroxidase antibody (ab1187, 200 μl, 1:1000 dilution; Abcam), was then added to each well and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Each well was then washed three times with 300 μl of PBST (1%). Detection of bound anti-Tax-horseradish peroxidase was detected using tetramethyl benzidine substrate as described by the manufacturer (Pierce) and measured using a microplate reader (450 nm). This procedure was repeated for a total of three times with each cell type. Treatment of Cells with Brefeldin A or a Combination of PMA and Ionomycin—Cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with secretion constructs as described under “Transient Transfections.” After transfection (24 h), the medium was removed and replaced with 2 ml of medium containing either brefeldin A (10 μg/ml) or a combination of PMA (100 nm; Sigma) and ionomycin (1 μm; Sigma). Cells were incubated for 4 h, after which time 1 ml of medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of new medium containing either brefeldin A or a combination of PMA and ionomycin. After initial medium replacement (24 h), the medium was removed and subjected to centrifugation at (400 × g). Medium and cells were then prepared as outlined under “ELISA Detection of Tax.” Detection of Apoptosis and Necrosis of Transfected BHK-21 Cells—Cells were plated in 8-well glass slides and either not transfected or transfected (pUC18, pTax, FTH6) as described under “Transient Transfections.” Untransfected cells incubated in medium containing 10 μm camptothecin (Sigma) for 4 h were used as the positive control for the experiments designed to detect apoptosis. Untransfected cells incubated in medium containing 50 μm ebselen (Sigma) for 6 h were used as the positive control for experiments to detect necrosis. Reactions with only ethanol and Me2SO were utilized to control for each solvent used with ebselen and camptothecin, respectively. After transfection (24 h), as well as after the stated length of time for each positive control, apoptosis and necrosis were detected using the Vybrant apoptosis detection kit 7 as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were viewed as described under “Microscopic Analyses.” Tax-YFP Co-localizes with Organelles Associated with Protein Secretion—Several studies have examined the intracellular localization of the HTLV-I Tax protein (19Szymocha R. Brisson C. Bernard A. Akaoka H. Belin M.F. Giraudon P. J. Neurovirol. 2000; 6: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 27Gitlin S.D. Lindholm P.F. Marriott S.J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2612-2621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Virology. 1992; 187: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Nicot C. Tie F. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6777-6784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the investigations, which examined Tax intracellular localization in HeLa and COS-7 cells and the HTLV-I-infected cell lines C8166-45 and MT2, have concluded that Tax resides mainly in the nucleus in the form of interchromatin granules and spliceosomal speckles (30Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sites of high rates of gene transcription. As a result, most studies of Tax function have focused on the role of nuclear Tax and its involvement in gene regulation. However, recent studies have demonstrated that there is a significant amount of Tax localized to the cytoplasm, an amount that is cell type-dependent. For example, recent studies utilizing HeLa cells and primary astrocytes or astrocytic cell lines infected with HTLV-I demonstrated that Tax accumulated to significant levels in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus (19Szymocha R.

https://openalex.org/W2028870834,"The effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in regulating the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory chemokine inter-leukin-8 (IL-8) in T lymphocytes is not yet defined, even though it may reduce or enhance IL-8 synthesis in other cell types. Here, we demonstrate that, in human T cells, PGE2 induced IL-8 mRNA transcription through prostaglandin E2 receptors 1- and 4-dependent signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), never before implicated in IL-8 transcription. Several kinases, including protein kinase C, Src family tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and p38 MAPK, were involved in PGE2-induced CHOP activation and IL-8 production. The transactivation of the IL-8 promoter by CHOP was NF-κB-independent. Our data suggest that PGE2 acts as a potent pro-inflammatory mediator by inducing IL-8 gene transcription in activated T cells through different signal transduction pathways leading to CHOP activation. These findings show the complexity with which PGE2 regulates IL-8 synthesis by inhibiting or enhancing its production depending on the cell types and environmental conditions.

Thus, it has been postulated that the heterogeneity of PGE2 immunoregulatory effects may depend on distinctive signaling mechanisms of different PGE2 receptors. PGE2 also displays a complex regulatory function in IL-8 gene expression depending on the concentrations employed and the cell specificity. IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils in local inflammatory sites and is produced by a wide variety of cells in response to different stimuli (18Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). At physiological as well as pathological concentrations up to 100 μm, PGE2 is able to up-regulate endogenous IL-8 expression in human intestinal epithelial cells (19Yu Y. Chadee K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3746-3752PubMed Google Scholar, 20Poligone B. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol.

Langdon C. Smith F. Richards C.D. J. Rheumatol. 1996; 23: 862-868PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PGE2 has no effect on neutrophil-derived IL-8 induced by lipopolysaccharide (22Wertheim W.A. Kunkel S.L. Standiford T.J. Burdick M.D. Becker F.S. Wilke C.A. Gilbert A.R. Strieter R.M. J.

T cells, is crucial for the ability of the immune system to control infection and inflammation. However, despite the well known activity of PGE2 as a mediator of immune and phlogistic responses, the role of this molecule in T cell production of IL-8 has not been well documented. In this study, we observed that PGE2 significantly increased the amount of IL-8 by inducing gene transcription through a novel signaling mechanism mediated by C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). We demonstrate that the signaling pathways triggered by EP1 and EP4 receptors and p38 MAPK are involved in this process. Therefore, we postulate that PGE2 may enhance the phlogistic response by inducing the release of the chemokine IL-8 from activated T lymphocytes. Reagents—PGE2, PGF2α, and staurosporine were obtained from Sigma (Milan, Italy). Anti-human CD3 and anti-human CD28 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Immunotech (Marseilles, France). SB 203580, PP2, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, H-89 dihydrochloride, bisindolylmaleimide I (GF 109203X), and LY 294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. PD98059 was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). SC-19220, AH 6809, sulprostone, butaprost, 17-phenyltrinor-PGE2 (PT-PGE2), 11-deoxy-PGE1, and PGI2 were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Cells and Culture Conditions—Peripheral T lymphocytes were isolated from human venous blood obtained from health adult volunteers as described previously (25Venza I. Giordano L. Piraino G. Medici N. Ceci G. Teti D. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, diluted whole blood (100 ml) was layered in centrifuge tubes onto 120 ml of Histopaque-1077 gradient (Sigma). T lymphocytes were magnetically separated from B cells using colloidal paramagnetic microbeads conjugated to mouse anti-CD19 surface antigen monoclonal antibody expressed on B lineage cells using negative selection columns (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). T cell expression of activation markers such as CD25 and CD71 was tested using cytofluorometric analysis. Only CD25– and CD71– lymphocytes were processed. Jurkat T cells (clone E6.1) were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Sigma) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air (37 °C) in RPMI 1640 medium (Euroclone, Milan) supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Euroclone), and 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Euroclone). Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma infection, and cultures were renewed from frozen stocks every 2 months. Cytokine Production Assay—T cells were cultured in round-bottom 24-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well) in the presence of anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) plus anti-CD28 (250 ng/ml) antibodies (26Harris S.G. Smith R.S. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1372-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were then immediately stimulated with PGE2, or PGI2, at different concentrations (stock solutions (100 mm) were prepared in ethanol and stored at –20 °C) and cultured for 24 h. In some experiments, cells were treated with various protein kinase inhibitors and EPR1/2 antagonists 1 h prior to the addition of PGE2. In other experiments, cells were treated with EPR1–4 agonists only and cultured for 24 h. After stimulation, supernatants were collected and analyzed for IL-8 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (BioSource International, Nivelles, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—T cells were cultured in 35-mm well plates (5 × 106 cells/well) in the absence or presence of anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) plus anti-CD28 (250 ng/ml) antibodies, and cells were then immediately stimulated for the indicated times with PGE2 at final concentrations of 10 and 100 μm. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Milan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reverse transcription-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl with an IMProm-II™ reverse transcriptase kit (Promega, Milan) according to the manufacture's instructions. 20 μl of reverse transcription products were brought to a volume of 100 μl containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm PCR nucleotide mixture, a 1 μm concentration of both the upstream and downstream PCR primers (Sigma), 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Transgenomic, Inc., Bergamo, Italy), and 10× PCR buffer (Transgenomic, Inc.). Two pairs of primers were used in this study. The primer sequences were as follows: IL-8, 5′-ATG ACT TCCAAG CTG GCC GTG GCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCT CAG CCC TCT TCA AAA ACT TCT C-3′ (antisense); and β-actin, 5′-TGA CGG GGT CTA CCC ACA CTG TGC CCC ATC TA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTA GAA GCA TTG CGC TGG ACG ATG GAG GG-3′ (antisense). Amplification was carried in a DNA thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Milan) after an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min. This was followed by 37 cycles of PCR using the following temperature and time profile: denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, primer annealing for 50 s at 58 °C for IL-8 and at 62 °C for β-actin, primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in 1× buffer containing 89 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.3) after staining with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The UV light-illuminated gels were photographed, and the relative sum intensity was calculated by normalizing the sum intensity of the IL-8 product to the β-actin mRNA control. Protein Kinase C (PKC) Assay—T cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and, where indicated, transfected with PTGER1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). The cells were then incubated with the appropriate stimuli for 15 min and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.3% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm benzamidine. PKC activity in the lysates was determined using the protein kinase assay from Amersham Biosciences (Milan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were cultured in 35-mm well plates at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/well. After stimulation, cells were lysed at 4 °C in 150 μl of M-PER lysis buffer (Pierce), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations of extracts were determined using a standard Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Milan). Cell lysates were dissolved in 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) 10% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue and boiled for 3 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min, cell lysates were analyzed on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline/Tween supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The blots were subsequently incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:200 dilution) to the EP1 and EP4 receptors (Cayman Chemical) or primary phospho-specific rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution) recognizing p38 MAPK phosphorylated at Thr180 and Tyr182 or activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) phosphorylated at Thr71 (Cell Signaling Technology, Milan). Primary anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Sigma) was used to normalize protein loading to that of specific proteins in each lane. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) or goat anti-mouse (Cell Signaling Technology) IgG as secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by autoradiography using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient Transfection—Liposome-mediated transient gene transfer was carried out with DMRIE-C (Invitrogen) as recommended by manufacturer. Briefly, cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells in 35-mm plates and transfected with a total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA using 6 μg of DMRIE-C/ml of RPMI 1640 medium without fetal calf serum. Transfected DNAs included 1 μg of pFR-Luc, a luciferase reporter gene including multimerized Gal4 upstream activating sequences upstream of the minimal promoter, the transactivator Gal-CHOP (50 ng; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), pSV-nlsLacZ DNA, a β-galactosidase expression vector (0.5 μg), and an empty plasmid DNA (pBSM) at a final concentration of 2 μg/plate. Jurkat cells (clone E6.1) were also transiently cotransfected with the pIL8-Luc plasmid (1 μg; kindly provided by Dr. Hector R. Wong, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH), pSV-nlsLacZ DNA, and an expression plasmid for CHOP (0.2 μg; kindly provided by Dr. Hidetoshi Hayashi, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan) as described in the figure legends. In all experiments, transfections were stopped after 6 h by the addition of an equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 10 or 100 μm PGE2. After an additional 6 h, cells were harvested, and protein extracts were prepared for the luciferase activity assay using luciferin (Promega) as the substrate. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity produced by cotransfected plasmid pnlsLacZ. siRNA and Transfection—Double-stranded siRNA sequences targeting PTGER1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM000955) and PTGER4 (accession number NM000958) mRNAs corresponding to the coding regions of residues 1009–1027 (5′-CCAGCTTGTCGGTATCATG-3′) and 954–972 (5′-TCAACCATGCCTATTTCTA-3′), respectively, were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). A nonspecific duplex (5′-CAGUGGAGAUCAACGUGCAAGUU-3′; Dharmacon) was used as a control, which did not significantly affect PTGER1 and PTGER4 mRNA and protein levels relative to the untransfected controls. Concentrations of siRNA and time of incubation were tested. EP1 and EP4 receptor knockdown reached the maximum at a concentration of 100 nm and at 24–48 h post-transfection. After 72 h, there was a modest increase in EP1 and EP4 receptor levels compared with 48 h post-transfection. To assess gene silencing, the protein levels of the EP1 and EP4 receptors were determined by immunoblotting. Jurkat T cells were plated in 35-mm well plates in RPMI 1640 medium without fetal bovine serum and transfected with double-stranded siRNA using the DMRIE-C reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after the siRNA transfections, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) plus anti-CD28 (250 ng/ml) antibodies with PGE2 at final concentrations of 10 and 100 μm for an additional 24 h. All cells were harvested for total protein extraction, and supernatants were processed for IL-8 production by ELISA. In another set of experiments, transfection with the Gal-CHOP chimeric transcription factor was followed by siRNA (PTGER1 and PTGER4) transfection 4 h later. Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—The relative intensities of protein and nucleic acid bands were analyzed using the Digital Sciences 1D program from Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems (New Haven, CT). Standard curves were run, and the data that were obtained were in the linear range of the curve. In addition, all values were normalized to their respective lane loading controls. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of n determinations. Results were analyzed by two-tailed Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered significant. IL-8 Protein Production after Stimulation with Prostaglandins—To determine whether PGE2 could enhance the synthesis of IL-8 protein, anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-stimulated T cells were cultured with different concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α, or PGI2, and IL-8 levels were measured in the supernatant by ELISA. Fig. 1 (A and B) shows that human peripheral T lymphocytes and Jurkat T cells produced significant elevated levels of IL-8 only when treated with PGE2 at 10 or 100 μm, with a higher significance at 100 μm. Therefore, stimulation with PGE2 leads to a dose-dependent release of IL-8 in T cells. PGE2 Induces IL-8 mRNA in Human T Cells—Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that stimulation of Jurkat cells with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody and subsequently with 10 or 100 μm PGE2 induced expression of IL-8 mRNA at 4 h, reaching a maximum at 5 h (Fig. 2A and B, respectively). The increase in IL-8 mRNA was not observed at 8 h after PGE2 treatment. The values of IL-8 mRNA were 2–4-fold over the basal expression of untreated cells when 10 μm PGE2 was employed, whereas they were 3–5-fold higher in cells treated with 100 μm PGE2. These results suggest that PGE2 increases IL-8 production at the transcriptional level in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. PGE2 Stimulates IL-8 Production via the EP1 and EP4 Receptors—To determine the EP receptors involved in IL-8 production by PGE2, cells were stimulated with the EP1 agonist PT-PGE2 (27Patrizio M. Colucci M. Levi G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the EP2 receptor agonist butaprost (27Patrizio M. Colucci M. Levi G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the EP3 receptor agonist sulprostone (27Patrizio M. Colucci M. Levi G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the EP4 agonist 11-deoxy-PGE1 (28Sylvia V.L. Del Toro Jr., F. Hardin R.R. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. Schwartz Z. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 78: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PT-PGE2 and 11-deoxy-PGE1 induced a significant increase in IL-8 release, whereas butaprost and sulprostone were not able to induce chemokine synthesis (Fig. 3A). In parallel experiments, both the selective EP1 antagonist SC-19220 (28Sylvia V.L. Del Toro Jr., F. Hardin R.R. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. Schwartz Z. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 78: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the EP1/2 antagonist AH 6809 (29Fiebich B.L. Schleicher S. Spleiss O. Czygan M. Hull M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) significantly inhibited the production of IL-8 induced by either 10 or 100 μm PGE2 (Fig. 3B). The effect of AH 6809 was most probably due to inhibition of EP1, but not EP2, since butaprost had no effect on IL-8. To further verify whether the effects of PGE2 on IL-8 production are mediated through the EP1 and EP4 receptors, we performed post-transcriptional gene silencing experiments for both receptors using synthetic siRNAs and evaluated IL-8 production. Under optimal conditions (100 nm siRNA, 24 h post-transfection), we achieved 70 and 85% knockdown of the EP1 and EP4 receptors at the protein level, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D, upper). The EP1 and EP4 receptor silencing by specific siRNAs reduced the IL-8 production in PGE2-treated cells by ∼35 and 45%, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D, lower). In contrast, the nonspecific control duplex did not affect IL-8 synthesis by PGE2. Therefore, these data indicate that the pro-inflammatory action of PGE2 is exerted via the EP1 and EP4 receptors. Inhibition of PKC, Src Family Kinases, and Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K), but Not Protein Kinase A (PKA), Blocks the PGE2-induced Synthesis of IL-8—The EP1 receptor induces changes in intracellular calcium levels that are believed to be mediated either by the phospholipase C signaling pathway, most likely via Gαq, or via direct activation of the calcium channel (28Sylvia V.L. Del Toro Jr., F. Hardin R.R. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. Schwartz Z. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 78: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathway activated by EP1 is represented mainly by PKC (30Breyer R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1357-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F12-F23PubMed Google Scholar) and Src family kinases (32Nagao M. Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22892-22898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To further determine the signaling mechanisms of PGE2, cells were pretreated with the PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I, staurosporine, and H-89 or with the specific Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2, and complete dose responses were evaluated (data not shown). At the concentrations reported in Fig. 4A, all compounds were able to completely suppress IL-8 synthesis induced by 10 or 100 μm PGE2. It has been shown that the EP4 receptor primarily utilizes a PI3K-dependent pathway and is less efficiently coupled to adenylyl cyclase and/or has additional pathways not involving cAMP/PKA signaling (33Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the role of these signaling pathways in the enhancement of IL-8 release by PGE2 using LY 294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, at a concentration of 20 μm, as resulted from a dose-response curve (data not shown), and H-89 in a nanomolar range, which inhibits PKA only (34Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, LY 294002 inhibited IL-8 production by 40%, whereas H-89 treatment did not interfere with the increase in IL-8 synthesis induced by the two concentrations of PGE2 employed. These results suggest that PKC, Src family kinases, and PI3K, but not PKA, participate in IL-8 synthesis. PGE2 Induces PKC Activation in T Cells—To support the evidence of the involvement of PKC in PGE2 induction of IL-8 synthesis, a PKC activity assay was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 5 shows that PGE2 (10 or 100 μm) induced a significant increase in basal PKC activity. The same effect was observed in anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-stimulated T cells (data not shown). Pretreatment with the PKC inhibitors completely suppressed the PGE2-induced PKC activity enhancement. To examine whether the modulation of PKC is mediated through the EP1 receptor, the cells were treated with EP1 agonist (PT-PGE2) or PGE2 and EP1 antagonist (SC-19220). PT-PGE2 caused a significant increase in PKC, whereas SC-19220 completely reverted the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on PKC activity. Similar results were obtained in cells transfected with PTGER1 siRNA and treated with PGE2 (data not shown). Induction of IL-8 Synthesis by PGE2 Is Not Mediated by NF-κB—IL-8 is an important NF-κB-regulated gene (35Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). To verify whether NF-κB activation is essential in the production of PGE2-induced IL-8 in activated human T cells, Jurkat T cells were treated with the NF-κB inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester (1–20 μm) 1 h prior to stimulation with PGE2 (10 or 100 μm). None of the caffeic acid phenethyl ester concentrations employed was able to modify the effects of PGE2 on IL-8 production (data not shown), thus suggesting that the induction of IL-8 by PGE2 in human T cells is NF-κB-independent. IL-8 Induction by PGE2 in Human T Cells Occurs via p38 MAPK—The mechanism of IL-8 induction has been reported to be mediated through the p38 MAPK pathway (36Iwahashi N. Murakami H. Nimura Y. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Parhar K. Ray A. Steinbrecher U. Nelson C. Salh B. Immunology. 2003; 108: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To verify that PGE2 enhances IL-8 synthesis from stimulated T cells via this MAPK pathway, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 (38Mancuso G. Midiri A. Beninati C. Piraino G. Valenti A. Nicocia G. Teti D. Cook J. Teti G. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was added to cultures 1 h before treatment with PGE2 (10 or 100 μm). Fig. 6 shows that this inhibitor significantly reduced PGE2-induced IL-8 production in T cells in a dose-dependent manner. PGE2 Activates p38 MAPK in T Cells—As inhibition of p38 MAPK prevented PGE2-induced IL-8 synthesis, we investigated the effect of PGE2 on the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. After treating cells with PGE2 for different times (15–480 min), total cell proteins were extracted and subjected to Western blotting with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of p38 MAPK. As shown in Fig. 7A, the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK occurred upon treatment of cells with either 10 or 100 μm PGE2 after 60 min and persisted for up to 360 min. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK induced by PGE2 resulted in the activation of the kinase since ATF-2, a substrate of p38 MAPK, was also phosphorylated with the same pattern. The specific inhibitor SB 203580 was able to prevent the phosphorylation as well as the activation of p38 MAPK induced by PGE2 (Fig. 7B). Activation of p38 MAPK by PGE2 Is Not Dependent on the PKC, Src Tyrosine Kinase, PI3K, and PKA Pathways—To investigate whether PKC, Src family kinases, PI3K, and PKA are involved in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK induced by PGE2, Jurkat T cells were treated with the specific PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, the specific Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2, the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY 294002, or the PKA inhibitor H-89 1 h prior to treatment with PGE2 and examined for the activated form of p38 MAPK by Western blot analysis. Treatment with bisindolylmaleimide I, PP2, LY 294002, or H-89 for 1 h did not affect the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK induced by PGE2 (Fig. 8). Similar results were obtained after treatment with 10 μm PGE2 (data not shown). PGE2-induced IL-8 Synthesis Is Regulated by the Transcription Factor CHOP—To determine whether PGE2 regulates IL-8 gene expression, experiments were performed by transfecting resting and activated Jurkat T cells with the wild-type IL-8 promoter, and afte"
https://openalex.org/W2146781730,"The 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11beta-HSD2) regulates access of 11beta-hydroxyglucocorticoids to the mineralocorticoid receptor by reducing the hydroxyl group of these steroids at position 11. Previous cell culture studies revealed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) down-regulates 11beta-HSD2 activity. Here, we demonstrate that transgenic mice overexpressing TNF-alpha have decreased mRNA abundance and activity of 11beta-HSD2 in kidney tissue, indicating that this effect may occur also in vivo. The analysis of the transcriptional regulation of 11beta-HSD2 by TNF-alpha and phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) with in vivo genomic footprinting in human colon SW620 cells revealed stimulus-dependent protein-DNA interactions in three promoter regions, kappaB1, Sp1/Egr-1I, and Sp1/Egr-1II. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the relevance of NF-kappaB binding to kappaB1 and of Egr-1 binding to Sp1/Egr-1 sites for the PMA and TNF-alpha effect. We observed a temporal switch of binding to kappaB1 site from active p65/p50 heterodimers to inactive p50/p50 homodimers. TNF-alpha or PMA treatment for 24 h resulted in accumulation of p50 and decrease of p65 nuclear proteins. Overexpression of p50 inhibited HSD11B2 promoter activity and overexpression of Egr-1 inhibited transactivation of the HSD11B2 promoter by p65/p50. In conclusion, TNF-alpha and PMA down-regulate expression and activity of 11beta-HSD2 most likely by a coordinate binding of p50/p50 and Egr-1 to the HSD11B2 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2034821602,"A central paradigm in immunology states that successful generation of high affinity antibodies necessitates an immense primary repertoire of antigen-combining sites. Much of the diversity of this repertoire is provided by varying one antigen binding loop, created by inserting randomly a D (diversity) gene out of a small pool between the V and J genes. It is therefore assumed that any particular D-encoded region surrounded by different V and J regions adopts a different conformation. We have solved the structure of two lysozyme-specific variable domains of heavy-chain antibodies isolated from two strictly unrelated dromedaries. These antibodies recombined identical D gene sequences to different V and J precursors with significant variance in their V(D)J junctions. Despite these large differences, the D-encoded loop segments adopt remarkably identical architectures, thus directing the antibodies toward identical epitopes. Furthermore, a striking convergent maturation process occurred in the V region, adapting both binders for their sub-nanomolar affinity association with lysozyme. Hence, on a structural level, humoral immunity may rely more on well developed maturation and selection systems than on the acquisition of large primary repertoires.

Hence, on a structural level, humoral immunity may rely more on well developed maturation and selection systems than on the acquisition of large primary repertoires. The interaction of conventional antibodies with antigens is mediated by up to six dedicated hypervariable loops, three (H1-H3) 1The abbreviations used are: H1, H2, H3, the first, second, and third hypervariable loops of the variable domain of the heavy chain of an antibody, respectively; L1, L2, L3, the first, second, and third hypervariable loops of the variable domain of the light chain of an antibody, respectively; VH, variable domain of the heavy chain of an immunoglobulin; VL, variable domain of the light chain of an immunoglobulin; VHH, variable domain of a heavy-chain antibody; cAb, camel single domain antibody; V, variable gene; D, diversity gene; J, joining gene; VH, variable gene of the variable domain of the heavy chain; VL, variable gene of the variable domain of the light chain; VHH, variable gene of a camelid heavy-chain antibody; JH, joining gene of the variable domain of the heavy chain; HEWL, hen egg white lysozyme; ΔASA, change of accessible surface area. in the variable domain of the heavy chain (VH) and three (L1-L3) in the variable domain of the light chain (VL) (1.Padlan E.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 57-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the antigen-combining site, the H3 loop is the major determinant of antibody diversity and the major contributor for overall antigen affinity and specificity (1.Padlan E.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 57-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 451-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Xu J.L. Davis M.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 37-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). This loop is generated after recombining one V, one D, and one J gene out of a pool. Imprecision in the V(D)J recombination event, with concomitant nucleotide deletions and N or P nucleotide additions (4.Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3177) Google Scholar, 5.Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), makes it possible for a particular D gene to occur in different locations and reading frames within the H3-encoded region (4.Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3177) Google Scholar, 5.Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hence, the sequence of the H3 loop becomes the most diverse of all antigen binding loops. The crystal structure determination of different antibodies revealed the presence of canonical structures for all antigen binding loops (L1-L3, H1, and H2) except for the H3 loop (6.Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 7.Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The folding of a particular loop into a canonical structure is dictated by a small number of conserved key residues within the hypervariable sequences. The immense sequence diversity of the H3 loop with the D-encoded part, which can be located anywhere within the loop, obviously precludes an easy assignment of such key residues. Moreover, because the number of possible V(D)J recombinations exceeds by far the number of crystal structures that are available, it is as yet impossible to investigate whether the D-encoded part of the loop adopts different or similar backbone architectures when present in a different V-J surrounding. Likewise, it remains an open question whether the same epitope on a large antigen will be recognized by antibodies originating from different B cell lineages that employed the same D gene in their V(D)J recombination. This might be expected if the structure of H3 loop is largely determined by the D gene-encoded segment and if this part of the paratope dominates the antigen specificity. However, this would also mean that the structural repertoire of the H3 loop is less diverse than predicted by the immense sequence diversity. These fundamental questions might be easier to assess with antibodies from camelids because a considerable fraction of their serum antibodies lack light chains (8.Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Nature. 1993; 363: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar, 9.Nguyen V.K. Desmyter A. Muyldermans S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Up to three loops (H1-H3) of the variable domain of these heavy-chain antibodies (VHH) constitute the antigen-binding site. The VHH, like VH, is generated after V(D)J gene rearrangements (10.Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of the light chain, the heavy-chain antibodies recognize, via their VHHs, a wide range of antigens with affinity constants that are comparable with those found for conventional antibodies (11.Muyldermans S. Cambillau C. Wyns L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 230-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The H3 loop of VHHs is, on average, longer than in human or mouse VHs (9.Nguyen V.K. Desmyter A. Muyldermans S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It was therefore postulated that the extended H3 loop compensates for the loss of VH-VL combinatorial diversity, making its contribution to the diversity of the repertoire even more significant than in conventional antibodies. Furthermore, the H3 loop of a VHH is even more crucial for specific antigen recognition than the H3 loop of a VH-VL paratope. This is illustrated by the crystal structures of VHH-antigen complexes where up to 100% of the contacts with the antigen can be provided by the H3 loop (12.Decanniere K. Desmyter A. Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Structure. 1999; 7: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13.Desmyter A. Decanniere K. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26285-26290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Here we report the structure of two VHHs, cAb-Lys2 and D2-L19, generated from different V and J genes but sharing identical D gene sequences. These binders had matured in two different dromedaries immunized with hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) to the same epitope and were helped by striking convergent hypermutations within the H2 loop region. The structure solution of these VHHs in complex with their antigen demonstrates that the in vivo recombination of an identical D gene segment can lead to congruent H3 loop architectures even when occurring in a different V-J context and masked by different somatic mutations. Isolation and Purification of the VHHs—The dromedary immunization in Morocco, library generation, and pannings to retrieve the lysozyme binder cAb-Lys2 have been described elsewhere (14.Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Other dromedaries kept in Dubai (United Arab Emirates) were immunized over a 2-month period with lysozyme, and phage-displayed libraries of the VHHs were made during the work described by Lauwereys et al. (15.Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Panning of these libraries with immobilized antigen yielded D2-L19 and six additional lysozyme-specific VHHs. D2-L19 and cAb-Lys2 were recloned in an expression vector and tagged with a His6 tail. The recombinant VHHs were produced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by IMAC and gel filtration according to Conrath et al. (16.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Kinetic and Affinity Measurements of the VHH-HEWL Interaction— The kinetic constants were determined by surface plasmon resonance on a Biacore 3000® (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). HEWL was immobilized on a CM5 chip by amine coupling using N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), and ethanolamine according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 100 resonance units of protein were immobilized in flow cell 2 of the chip. The surface in flow cell 1 was used as a reference and treated only with EDC, NHS, and ethanolamine. Sensorgrams of five concentrations (500-30 nm (D2-L19) and 50-3 nm (cAb-Lys2)) plus a zero concentration (injection of running buffer) were collected. The curves were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model with the BIAevaluation software (version 3.2) (BIAcore) after subtraction of the reference and zero concentration data. Identical ka and kd values were obtained for measurements with antibodies immobilized (100 resonance units) to the matrix surface and HEWL in the mobile phase. Crystallization of the VHH-HEWL Complexes—The VHH-HEWL complexes were obtained following existing protocols (17.Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Crystallization of complexes was performed by hanging drop vapor diffusion in 0.17 m Li2SO4, 0.085 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 25.5% polyethylene glycol 4000, 15% glycerol for the D2-L19-HEWL complex (10 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline buffer) and 0.3 m (NH4)2SO4, 10-20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 15% glycerol for the cAb-Lys2-HEWL complex (15 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). Successive macro seeding was required to produce single crystals of the cAb-Lys2-HEWL complex. Data Collection and Structure Solution—The crystals of the D2-L19-HEWL and cAb-Lys2-HEWL complexes belong to the space group P212121 with, respectively, unit cell dimensions: a = 51.5 Å, b = 53.4 Å, c = 104.5 Å, α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 90° and a = 50.0 Å, b = 68.4 Å, c = 72.1 Å, α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 90°. Synchrotron data for the crystal of the D2-L19-HEWL complex were obtained at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID14-2 using a CCD ADSC Quantum 4 detector for data collection. Synchrotron data for the cAb-Lys2-HEWL crystals were obtained at the BW7B beamline of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory synchrotron facility at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany) using a Marresearch image plate detector. Data were processed to 1.85 and 1.4 Å for D2-L19-HEWL and cAb-Lys2-HEWL, respectively, using DENZO and Scalepack (18.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The AMORE program (19.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). Contacts were also determined with the Contact program from the CCP4 software package, and Sc values were calculated using the Sc program (22.Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The figures were prepared with Pymol, Molscript (23.Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), and Raster3D (24.Merrit E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). Ontogeny of D2-L19 and cAb-Lys2—Two VHHs, cAb-Lys2 (retrieved from a dromedary immunized in 1993 in Morocco) and D2-L19 (retrieved from a dromedary immunized in 1997 in Dubai), were isolated by phage display (14.Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 15.Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Remarkably, these VHHs apparently employed the same D gene that was rearranged to different V and J segments. Although the exact borders are difficult to infer, it appears that the D gene encodes the peptide stretch 100b-100j (Kabat numbering, Ref. 25.Kabat, E. A., Wu, T. T., Perry, H. M., Gottesman, K. S., and Foeler, C. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Publication 91-3242, U. S. Public Health Services, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar), introducing a gap at positions 100 and 100a in cAb-Lys2 for better alignment (Fig. 1A). The comparison of these putative D-derived sequences in the final VHH genes revealed five nucleotide differences leading to 2 amino acid substitutions. The most frequently encountered J segments, 2V. K. Nguyen, unpublished observation. JH3 and JH5, were used for the D-J recombination of cAb-Lys2 and D2-L19, respectively. A search in the VHH germ line data base (10.Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) revealed that the V region of cAb-Lys2 most probably originates from the cvhhp08 germ line gene (89% sequence identity, AJ245114.1), onto which 17 nucleotide transitions and 13 transversions accumulated, whereas the V region of D2-L19 most probably originates from the cvhhp11 germ line gene (88.5% sequence identity, AJ245117.1). Nucleotide sequence alignment of D2-L19 and cvhhp11 indicated that the triplets GGT GGT GGT (codons 53-55) had been mutated and shortened to AGT GGT. In addition, 11 transitions and 14 transversions were introduced. These two germ line genes belong to the VHH subfamily 2a that is most frequently used to generate heavy-chain antibodies in dromedary (10.Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The number of mutations and the mutation pattern that are observed in these binders are typical for antibodies obtained after in vivo affinity maturation (2.Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 451-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Foote J. Milstein C. Nature. 1991; 352: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 27.Foote J. Eisen H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1254-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Both binders preserved a Cys-33 in the H1 loop that is available for disulfide bond formation with Cys-100d in the H3 loop encoded by the putative D gene. The remaining sequence of the H1 loop and the N-terminal part of H3 (encoded by the V-D junction) differ substantially between the two VHHs. In contrast, the sequences of the H2 loops underwent a striking convergent evolution toward a high degree of identity: 12 of 17 residues became identical (Fig. 1A). Kinetics, Affinity, and Epitope Mapping—The VHH interaction with HEWL yielded monophasic association curves in surface plasmon resonance sensorgrams, consistent with a fast association (ka of 3.0 and 2.2 × 106 m−1 s−1) between two rigid molecules lacking large conformational changes upon binding (28.Karlsson, R., and Fält, A. (1997) J. Immunol. MethodsGoogle Scholar). The kd values differ 50-fold: 9 × 10−3 s−1 for D2-L19 and 2 × 10−4 s−1 for cAb-Lys2, so that their equilibrium constants (KD) for HEWL are 2.9 nm and 77 pm. These values are typical for affinity-matured antibodies (3.Xu J.L. Davis M.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 37-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 26.Foote J. Milstein C. Nature. 1991; 352: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Mutual interference for antigen binding on the biosensor indicated that the VHHs associate with an overlapping epitope on HEWL. In addition, both antibody fragments eliminate the HEWL-mediated lysis (29.Taylor M.A. Rajpal A. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1857-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) of Micrococcus luteus cells. Furthermore, Biebrich Scarlett, a dye interacting with the carbohydrate substrate D, E, and F subsites of HEWL (30.Holler E. Rupley J.A. Hess G.P. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), competitively inhibited both VHH-HEWL associations (not shown). VHH-HEWL Complex Structures and Interfaces—Definitive proof for an overlapping epitope was provided by an overlay of the crystal structures of cAb-Lys2 and D2-L19 in complex with HEWL, determined to 1.4 and 1.85 Å resolution, respectively. Both VHHs associate with the antigen in a nearly identical orientation (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the two binders share many epitope residues, although the cAb-Lys2 epitope is larger (Fig. 1C). Both epitopes encompass residues of the substrate D, E, and F subsites of HEWL (31.Strynadka N.C. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 401-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), including the catalytic residues Glu-35 and Asp-52 of HEWL (Glu-35L and Asp-52L). The paratopes are highly complementary to their epitopes with surface correlation values (22.Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar) of 0.79 and 0.71 for D2-L19 and cAb-Lys2 complex, respectively. The total change of solvent-accessible surface area (ΔASA) of the VHHs (642 and 771 Å2) and their HEWL antigen (741 and 795 Å2) upon complexation are within the range of other antibody-antigen associations (32.Lo Conte L.

Protein Chem. 2003; 61: 119-160Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Only the VHH residues from the H2 and H3 loops participate in antigen binding. However, the majority of contacts are mediated by the H3 loop (78% for D2-L19 and 80% for cAb-Lys2), of which the part encoded by the common D region and the first two J codons provides crucial contacts with the antigen. The peptide stretch 100b-k and 101 of H3 contributes for 398 Å2 (62.2%) to the paratope ΔASA of D2-L19. In addition, 12 of the 15 direct hydrogen bonds between the VHH and HEWL are found here. The equivalent loop segment of cAb-Lys2 contributes for 465 Å2 (60.5%) to the ΔASA of its paratope with 11 of the 14 direct hydrogen bonds. Conservation of H3 Loop Conformation and Convergent Maturation of the H2 Loop—A remarkably congruent conformation is adopted by the peptides 100b-k and 101-103 encoded by the D gene and D-J junction, including an interloop disulfide bond that helps to reduce the number of possible conformations in the antigen-free form (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the C-terminal part of the H3 loop in VHH consistently folds over and interacts with the framework 2 region of the β-barrel (Fig. 2B) as has been seen previously (9.Nguyen V.K. Desmyter A. Muyldermans S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the different hypermutations in the D-encoded segments, probably acquired during antigen-driven selection, resulting in Pro-100h (cAb-Lys2) and its equivalent Arg-100h (D2-L19) impose a different arrangement of scaffold Phe-37 (V encoded) and Trp-103 (J encoded) residues (Fig. 2B). Hence, the conformation of the D and J gene-encoded fragment of H3 is not completely dominated by framework residues. In contrast with the conserved architecture of the putative D- and D-J-encoded regions, the oligopeptides encoded by the V-D junction of both HEWL binders adopt widely different conformations (Fig. 2A). In addition, the backbone conformation of the H1 loop and the tip of the H2 loop are significantly different in the two VHHs (Fig. 2C). The paratope residues in H2 of D2-L19 and cAb-Lys2 accumulated many somatic mutations, of which several witnessed a striking convergent evolution: A50V, Y52D, Y59A in cAb-Lys2 and A50V, N52D, Y59A in D2-L19 (Fig. 1A). From all these convergent maturations, the Y59A mutation occurring in both VHHs in particular plays a pivotal role for HEWL interaction because it creates a cavity between the H2 and H3 loops. The Thr-47 of HEWL (Thr-47L) fits into this cavity and is surrounded by residues occluding solvent from this site (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Thr-47L is an energetic hot spot of the VHH-HEWL interaction (32.Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar, 34.Rajamani D. Thiel S. Vajda S. Camacho C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11287-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Indeed, Thr-47L has in both cases the highest ΔASA of all epitope residues, accounting for 18 and 20%, and making two hydrogen bonds with cAb-Lys2 and three with D2-L19. The amino acids that contact Thr-47L include Val-50 and Asp-52, which were matured, respectively, from Ala-50 and Tyr-52 in cAb-Lys2 and Ala-50 and Asn-52 in D2-L19 (Fig. 1A). The convergent maturation of the amino acid at position 50 results in an optimized contact between this amino acid and the side chain of Thr-47L (Fig. 3, A and B). The larger side chain of the matured Val-50 compared with the germ line-encoded Ala allows a closer fit between the side chain of Thr-100f and atoms located around the β-bulge at position 47-48 of the VHH framework 2 region. This probably stabilizes the conformation of the H3 loop. The Asp-52 also contacts Thr-47L via its side chain, either through a direct hydrogen bond between the Oδ of Asp-52 and the hydroxyl group on the side chain of Thr-47L in the D2-L19-HEWL complex or through a bridging water molecule in the cAb-Lys2-HEWL complex. The difference in orientation of the Asp-52 side chain in the two VHH-HEWL complexes might have several explanations. There might be some influence from different packing of the D2-L19-HEWL or cAb-Lys2-HEWL complexes within the respective crystals. Alternatively, the Asp-52 residue might have been selected in these VHHs for other than pure structural reasons. Two HEWL-specific VHHs, cAb-Lys2 and D2-L19, were obtained after phage display from two different immunized dromedaries. Sequence analysis revealed that both VHHs resulted from the recombination of a common D gene with different V and J genes, evidently leading to different V-D and D-J junctions. Despite significant differences in these V-D- and D-J-encoded regions, the D-encoded peptides adopt an identical conformation. Interestingly, the hypermutations acquired in the D-encoded part of the H3 loop segments do not change the loop conformation but impose a different arrangement in the framework residues Phe-37, Arg-45, and Trp-103 (Fig. 2B). The D-encoded amino acids are located centrally in the VHH-HEWL interface and provide key interactions with the antigen. Furthermore, a striking convergent maturation process occurred in the H2 region, adapting both binders for their high affinity association with an identical epitope on HEWL. It is clear that the two VHHs described in this report are clonally independent from each other, because they originate from two different animals. The retention of the D gene sequences in these extensively matured binders argues for a severe bias of the D-encoded amino acids to interact with a particular antigen. This statement is not formulated from an isolated observation as it is further supported by the comparison of the sequences of VHHs with common antigen specificity (e.g. carbonic anhydrase or HEWL) (Fig. 4A). The comparison revealed that an apparent D gene preference and convergent maturation via hypermutations toward the same loop sequences are regularly observed. Moreover, epitope-mapping experiments revealed that the binders sharing identical D segments also bind to overlapping epitopes on their respective antigens. 3E. De Genst, K. Silence, S. Muyldermans, and L. Wyns, unpublished results. Although preferential V, D, and J gene recombination has been reported for conventional antibody responses against particular haptens (2.Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 451-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Foote J. Milstein C. Nature. 1991; 352: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 35.Manser T. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it has not yet been documented for large protein antigens. The frequent occurrence of common D genes in antibodies selected against the same antigen could also arise from a limited structural repertoire of this loop within the primary antigen-combining sites. The crystal structures of D2-L19 and cAb-Lys2 with a remarkable identical conformation for the C-terminal part of the H3 loop encoded by a common D gene support this idea. We then wondered whether the architecture of this part of the loop would also occur when encoded by other D genes. Comparison of all available VHH crystal structures revealed that the conformation adopted by the 8-residue peptide upstream of Trp-103 is encountered in at least three other VHHs. These VHHs employed different D genes and are directed against unrelated antigens: the cAb-MazE binds MazE, the anti-toxin of the MazEF extrachromosomal addiction system in E. coli. (36.Loris R. Marianovsky I. Lah J. Laeremans T. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Biol.

Ghahroudi M.A. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Structure. 1999; 7: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and cAb-HuL06 recognizes human lysozyme (37.Dumoulin M. Last A.M. Desmyter A. Decanniere K. Canet D. Larsson G. Spencer A. Archer D.B. Sasse J. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Redfield C. Matagne A. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 424: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). In each case, the C-terminal part of the H3 of these paratopes makes important interactions with the antigen. The identical backbone architecture of these peptide stretches is dictated at one end by a Thr or Leu residue filling the cavity formed between two β-bulges in framework 2 (44-45 and 47-48). The following 4 residues consistently form a complete turn of a 310-helix. At the other end, the peptide stretch is attached to the conserved Trp-103, initiating the last β-strand of the immunoglobulin fold. In between, an aromatic residue encoded by the J gene and conserved in all camelid JH genes (Tyr-100k in D2-L19 or Phe-100k in cAb-Lys2) points toward the VHH framework and forms an aromatic core with Trp-103 and Phe-37 (Figs. 2B and 4A). The latter side chains are sufficiently flexible to accommodate different loop sequences. Our results therefore suggest that the recombination of identical D genes to different VHH and J precursors would frequently lead to identical H3 loop architectures. The observation of a structural conservation within part of the H3 loop has two main consequences. First, the structural insight of this peptide stretch and allocation of its key residues have a structure-predictive value for other VHHs. Secondly, it argues for a severe limitation of the structural repertoire of the antigen-combining sites in the primary repertoire. This contradicts our previous assumption that a longer H3 loop in camelid antibodies with a concomitantly larger possible sequence repertoire considerably extends the structural variability of H3 loops (11.Muyldermans S. Cambillau C. Wyns L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 230-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A striking convergent maturation occurred in the H2 loops of cAb-Lys2 and D2-L19. This maturation is accompanied by significant structural changes. The acquired hypermutations create a cavity in the paratope that accommodates the side chain of Thr-47 of HEWL. In particular, the Y59A mutation is essential to avoid sterical clashes and to allow the observed arrangement of the VHH-HEWL complex. The remaining convergent amino acid substitutions optimize the shape and chemical environment around the cavity for a further improvement of the interaction with the antigen. Thus, it corroborates that the somatic hypermutation leading to a convergent maturation during the antigen-driven selection process is an essential element to generate high affinity binders. Moreover, this process helps the VHHs that are assembled from the same D sequence in their maturation process toward the same epitope. There exists considerable controversy on the physiological role of somatic hypermutation in the antigen maturation process (38.Flajnik M.F. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Whereas an affinity-based maturation function has been proposed for anti-hapten responses in mice, the physiological relevance of affinity augmentation upon somatic hypermutation for larger antigens has been contested. High affinity antibodies have been observed in mice challenged during their first encounter with a pathogen (39.Roost H.P. Bachmann M.F. Haag A. Kalinke U. Pliska V. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a non-pathogenic protein antigen (40.Goldbaum F.A. Cauerhff A. Velikovsky C.A. Llera A.S. Riottot M.M. Poljak R.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6040-6045PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy can be explained by the limited number of contact points between an antibody and a hapten as opposed to protein epitopes, which encompass more than 700 Å2 of interaction surface (32.Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar, 33.Sundberg E.J. Mariuzza R.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 61: 119-160Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Our observations show that somatic hypermutation also plays a significant role in the adaptation phase of the antigen-combining site toward a large targeted epitope. This maturation allows for the selection of a higher degree of antigen specificity of the binders. Are there other possibilities that could explain our observation apart from a strong maturation-driven selection process from VHHs with a restricted structural repertoire? One could indeed envisage a situation whereby an extremely large structural diversity occurs within the VHH primary repertoire. In this scenario, it is accepted that VHHs employing the same D gene can adopt a wide variety of H3 structures when present in a different V and J context. However, the antigen encounter resulted in the selection of only a few VHH variants that by chance presented the D-encoded part in a similar conformation. Alternatively, it can be argued that the particular antigen (HEWL) used in this study can only associate with a limited amount of paratope structures, so that all VHHs with other H3 loop conformations were immediately excluded from the selection. Finally, it can postulated that the camelid heavy-chain antibody maturation and VHHs constitute an exception that cannot be extrapolated to conventional antibodies because they lack the combinatorial diversity provided by the VL association and the VL interaction might induce many more H3 loop configurations. Although these alternatives cannot be formally excluded, they certainly do not explain the successful immunization of transgenic mice containing only one or a limited number of VH and VL genes (3.Xu J.L. Davis M.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 37-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 41.Lonberg N. Taylor L.D. Harding F.A. Trounstine M. Higgins K.M. Schramm S.R. Kuo C.C.

Nature. 1994; 368: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In these studies it was convincingly shown that the availability of an extended V gene repertoire is optional and that the somatically generated diversity within H3 is sufficient to produce antigen-specific antibodies. In addition, Xu and Davis (3.Xu J.L. Davis M.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 37-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) reported a remarkable sequence and length restriction in the H3 loops of antigen-specific antibodies obtained from primary responses of transgenic mice containing only one or a limited number of VH and VL genes (3.Xu J.L. Davis M.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 37-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 41.Lonberg N. Taylor L.D. Harding F.A. Trounstine M. Higgins K.M. Schramm S.R. Kuo C.C.

Nature. 1994; 368: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether this restriction resulted from clonal expansion of a limited primary repertoire or from a profound D gene preference. Our results certainly favor the former explanation and indicate that even a large structural repertoire of H3 loops is not essential because subsequent maturation and selection mechanisms seem far more important in vivo to select for antigen binders of high affinity. Such a natural maturation-driven selection process is exactly opposite to the general strategy applied in vitro when binders are isolated from vast naive or synthetic man-made antibody libraries by phage display (42.Hoogenboom H.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 178: 1-37PubMed Google Scholar). In the selection process with phage-displayed libraries, the success rate to retrieve multiple binders of high affinity for any particular target depends critically on the size and diversity of the library. In this respect, the ribosome display techniques might be a better mimic of the natural in vivo maturation-driven selection process as point mutations that might increase the affinity and specificity for the target are introduced during the reverse transcription and PCR amplification steps after each selection cycle (43.Schaffitzel C. Hanes J. Jermutus L. Plückthun A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be seen if these in vitro evolution methods can compete with the in vivo maturation mechanisms in terms of affinity and specificity.

In an effort to understand better this concept of exonucleolytic proofreading by autonomous 3′-exonucleases to edit kinetically blocked DNA 3′ termini we have determined the x-ray structure of the human TREX2 dimer with data extending to 2.47 Å resolution. The TREX2 protein is structurally very similar to the bacterial ϵ subunit of DNA polymerase III (ϵ subunit) (31DeRose E.F. Li D.W. Darden T. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 94-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Hamdan S. Carr P.D. Brown S.E. Ollis D.L. Dixon N.E.

(33Breyer W.A. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 12: 1125-1128Google Scholar) proteins despite their low sequence homology (∼17% identity). The conservation of this protein fold from bacteria to mammals indicates that the TREX2 structure is an efficient scaffold to orient the catalytic residues for excision at DNA 3′ termini. The position of the active sites in the TREX2 dimer and the adjacent flexible region provides an explanation for the tight DNA binding and robust catalytic activity of the TREX2 enzyme. Enzyme Preparation—The plasmid construct used to express the human TREX2 enzyme and mutants in Escherichia coli and purification of the TREX2 used for structural studies has been described (7Perrino F.W. Krol A. Harvey S. Zheng S.L. Horita D.A. Hollis T. Meyers D.A. Isaacs W.B. Xu J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2004; 44: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For the TREX2 and mutants used in exonuclease assays a 10/10 Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) was substituted for the phosphocellulose column in the final step. The TREX2 sample in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol was loaded onto the Mono Q column, washed with the equilibration buffer, and developed with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in the equilibration buffer. The peak fraction containing the TREX2 protein eluted at ∼250 mm NaCl at a concentration of ∼0.5 mg/ml and was stored in aliquots at -80 °C. The TREX2 concentrations were determined by A280 using the molar extinction coefficient ϵ = 16,860 m-1 cm-1 (52Gill S.C. Vonhippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). All TREX2 mutant plasmid constructs were produced using a PCR site-directed mutagenesis strategy (53Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Shinsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar), and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Selenomethionyl-derivatized protein was expressed utilizing methionine pathway inhibition (54Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) and behaved nearly identically to native protein with respect to solubility. Approximately 2 mg of purified protein/liter of cell culture was obtained for both the native and selenomethionyl protein. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—The purified TREX2 protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol. Crystallization was carried out by the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method. Protein solution (5 mg/ml) was mixed with equal volume well solution (0.4 m ammonium phosphate, 7% PEG 400). Crystals grow in about 2 weeks but can be grown overnight with microseeding from existing crystals. Prior to data collection crystals were soaked in 0.4 m ammonium phosphate, 25% PEG 400 for 2 min in preparation for freezing. Crystals were then mounted in a nylon loop and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 52.5, b = 77.2, c = 101.7 Å. Two TREX2 molecules occupy the asymmetric unit (VM = 2.0, 38% solvent). Phasing and Refinement—X-ray data were collected at three x-ray energies corresponding to the selenium peak (0.97832 Å), inflection (0.97876 Å), and remote (0.95000 Å) wavelengths at beamline X12-C of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratories (Upton, NY). Intensity data were processed using the programs DENZO/SCALEPACK (55Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Five ordered selenium sites were located in the crystallographic asymmetric unit using the program SOLVE (56Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phases were calculated with the program MLPHARE (57Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), and density modification was performed with RESOLVE (34Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). Model building was performed with the program O (58Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The model was refined with no noncrystallographic constraints against the peak wavelength data set by conjugate gradient minimization and torsion angle-restrained molecular dynamics using the program CNS (59Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The success of the refinement was evaluated at each stage by the change in the free R factor (60Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar) and by inspection of stereochemical parameters with the programs PROCHECK (61Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) and ERRAT (29Colovos C. Yeates T.O. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar). Model refinement converged with a final R factor of 21.6% (Rfree = 26.1%), using all observed x-ray data measurements in the resolution range 25–2.47 Å. A Ramachandran plot shows that greater than 91% of all residues in the model have ϕ and Ψ angles in the most preferred regions with no residues in the disallowed regions. The coordinates of the TREX2 dimer have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 1Y97). Protein Sequence and Structure Alignments—The structural coordinates of the E. coli epsilon protein (1J53), exoI (1FXX), and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (1KSP) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) and superimposed on TREX2 model coordinates by a least squares superpositioning of homologous residues in the exonuclease active site. The structure-based sequence alignment of each 3′-exonuclease with TREX2 was created based on structural alignments using the program DALI (www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/). Exonuclease Assays—The exonuclease activities of TREX2 and the catalytic mutants were measured in 10-μl reactions using 50 nm32P-labeled (dT)20 oligonucleotide substrate as described (7Perrino F.W. Krol A. Harvey S. Zheng S.L. Horita D.A. Hollis T. Meyers D.A. Isaacs W.B. Xu J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2004; 44: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis the (dT)20 concentrations were varied for TREX2 (5–500 nm) and for TREX2R163A/R165A/R167A (1,000–100,000 nm), and kinetic constants were determined as described previously (7Perrino F.W. Krol A. Harvey S. Zheng S.L. Horita D.A. Hollis T. Meyers D.A. Isaacs W.B. Xu J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2004; 44: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All incubations were 20 min at 25 °C. Enzyme concentrations are indicated in the figure and table legends. Structure of TREX2—The structure of the human TREX2 3′ → 5′-exonuclease was determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiments at three x-ray energies (Fig. 1 and Table I) using a crystal of the selenomethionyl protein. After density modification by solvent flattening (34Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar) the electron density was of high quality for most residues in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2). Three segments spanning residues 159–168, 185–187, and 229–236 were disordered in both monomers and omitted from the crystallographic model. The crystallographic model of the TREX2 dimer has been refined to an R factor of 21.6% (Rfree = 26.1%) using all x-ray data extending to a resolution limit of 2.47 Å (Table I).Table ICrystallographic data and refinement statisticsPeakInfectionRemoteWavelength (Å)0.978320.978760.95000Max resolution (Å)2.32.42.7Completeness (%)93 (80)96 (87)94 (84)Rmerge (%)7.8 (18.8)6.9 (17.2)9.6 (19.1)I/σ19 (4.5)17 (5)13 (4.5)Average redundancy554Phasing power (2.5 Å)1.160.98Rcullis0.790.83Initial figure of merit0.41After density modification0.65Resolution range (Å)30.0-2.47Rfactor (%)21.6Rfree (%)26.1R.m.s.d.aR.m.s.d., root mean square difference bond lengths (Å)0.011R.m.s.d. bond angles (°)1.95Spacegroup, P212121; unit cell (Å) a = 52.46, b = 77.23, c = 101.72; molecules/a.u. = 2.Rmerge = Σ|I - 〈I〉|/ΣI, where I is the observed intensity and 〈I〉 is the average intensity.

TREX2 is a compact single domain protein consisting of a central, five-stranded, antiparallel, twisted β-sheet surrounded by nine α-helices (Fig. 1A). The TREX2 protein dimerizes about a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis perpendicular to the β-strands, connecting the individual β-sheets of each monomer at the interface to form an extended β-sheet core through the observed dimer. Formation of the crystallographic dimer is consistent with the observation of TREX2 dimerization in solution (6Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17022-17029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and is the first structure determined of a dimeric 3′-deoxyribonuclease. The TREX2 dimer observed in the crystal is likely the same as the one present in solution for several reasons. The interface between subunits of the dimer, consisting mainly of strand β3 and helix α4 of each monomer, buries about 1,500 Å2 of surface area from each monomer. This substantial interface, which consists of nearly 10% of the surface area of each monomer, is formed predominantly by 19 hydrogen bonds with additional contributions from hydrophobic interactions and three salt bridges. The hydrogen bonds are formed mostly by the backbone amide nitrogens and carbonyl oxygens between the β3-strands in the creation of the extended β-sheet. The interactions in this interface far exceed all other protein packing interactions present in the crystal. Overall, the individual protomers in the dimer adopt structurally similar conformations with a root mean square difference of only 0.42 Å between the backbone atoms of each monomer. The minor differences present are mostly the result of the N-terminal six residues in one monomer having a different packing arrangement in the crystal than in the other monomer. One result of the observed interaction is the creation of two faces on the dimer. The “back” face is relatively flat with scattered positive charge, whereas the “front” face of the dimer contains both active sites (Fig. 1B) on opposite outer edges. Each active site is a spacious cleft framed by strand β1 and helices α5, α7, and α8. The five conserved residues (Asp14, Glu16, Asp123, Asp193, and His188) comprising the conserved exo motifs (31DeRose E.F. Li D.W. Darden T. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 94-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Hamdan S. Carr P.D. Brown S.E. Ollis D.L. Dixon N.E.

Biol. 2000; 12: 1125-1128Google Scholar) are positioned within the cleft. The calculated electrostatic potential of the front face shows regions of positive charge flanking each active site which might contribute to DNA interactions. The disordered loop (159–168) not included in the structure of either monomer is adjacent to the active site and contains three arginines, which would increase the overall positive charge in the active site region. In our calculations the active sites appear to have an overall negative charge because of the conserved four acidic residues in each required for coordination of the magnesium ions that are necessary for catalysis. Comparison of TREX2 with Other 3′-Exonucleases—The primary sequence of TREX2 most closely relates to the DnaQ family of 3′-exonucleases by virtue of three conserved exonuclease sequence motifs (exoI, exoII, and exoIII) that identify the divalent metal binding residues required for catalytic activity (36Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 37Huang Y. Braithwaite D.K. Ito J.

The presence of histidine rather than tyrosine in the exoIII motif of TREX2 places this enzyme in a subgroup of the exonuclease family of which TREX1 and TREX2 are the only known human members (4Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19655-19660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 40Barnes M.H. Spacciapoli P. Li D.H. Brown N.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4005-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 42Strauss B.S. Sagher D. Acharya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 806-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The overall fold of the TREX2 protein monomer is very similar to the bacterial ϵ subunit and the exoI members of this subgroup. A comparison of the structures of the bacterial exonucleases with TREX2 shows the conservation of the five central β-strands and seven α-helices (Fig. 3). The TREX2 enzyme contains an additional helix, α1, not present in the bacterial exonucleases. Residues in helix α1 participate in hydrogen bonding interactions across the TREX2 dimer interface with residues of helix α3 of the opposing monomer. The presence of helix α1 in TREX2 and not in the bacterial exonucleases likely accounts, in part, for the unique dimeric structure of TREX2. The strands β2a and β2b of TREX2 constitute a unique β-hairpin positioned centrally on the top and bottom of the front face of the TREX2 dimer (Fig. 3, A and B). There is also clear structural dissimilarity between TREX2 and the bacterial enzymes in the loop region positioned between helices α6 and α7 of TREX2. A superposition of the structures of ϵ subunit and exoI onto TREX2 shows a strict structural conservation of the residues that comprise the active site; the Asp14, Glu16, Asp123, and Asp193 are properly situated in TREX2 to coordinate two divalent magnesium ions (Fig. 4). By analogy to the ϵ subunit (31DeRose E.F. Li D.W. Darden T. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 94-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Hamdan S. Carr P.D. Brown S.E. Ollis D.L. Dixon N.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 535-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and exoI structures, (33Breyer W.A. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 12: 1125-1128Google Scholar) His188 in TREX2 is well positioned to deprotonate a water molecule positioned adjacent to the target phosphate. The hydroxyl nucleophile could then attack the phosphate to affect bond cleavage (43Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). To test the catalytic role of the conserved carboxylate residues and the His188 a series of TREX2 mutants was prepared by changing these residues to Ala. The exonuclease activities of these TREX2 mutants were measured in the presence of increased amounts of enzyme using a (dT)20 oligonucleotide and compared with the wild-type TREX2 (Table II). A small amount of activity was detected for all of the TREX2 mutants tested. Quantification of these activities indicated 104-106-fold reductions in activity relative to the wild-type TREX2 (Table II). These data confirm the catalytic role of these residues in TREX2 and suggest that the TREX2 exonuclease utilizes a catalytic mechanism similar to that of the bacterial members of this subgroup in the DnaQ family.Fig. 4The TREX2 active site contains the conserved residues of the exoI, exoII, and exoIII motifs (shown in red). The acidic residues (Asp14, Glu16, Asp123, and Asp193) in concert with His188 are proposed to coordinate two magnesium ions that are involved in DNA binding and are necessary for catalysis. The exo motifs are also structurally conserved among all other members of the DnaQ family of 3′-exonucleases, suggesting that they share a common catalytic mechanism.

Previous studies have demonstrated that BCL-6 and Stat6 can both bind and regulate the Iϵ promoter that controls immunoglobulin heavy chain class switching to IgE. Examination of BCL-6−/- and BCL-6−/-Stat6−/- mice has demonstrated that BCL-6 is a repressor of IgE and that Stat6 is still required for the interleukin-4 (IL-4) induction of class switching to IgE in B cells lacking BCL-6. To define the mechanisms by which BCL-6 represses IL-4 function, we analyzed the role of BCL-6 in repressing the Iϵ promoter. There are three BCL-6-binding sites within this IL-4-responsive promoter. Analysis of Iϵ promoters that have mutated BCL-6-binding sites demonstrates that at least two of these sites are required for maximal BCL-6 repression of this locus. Footprinting analysis demonstrates that BCL-6 binds cooperatively to the two upstream binding sites in the Iϵ promoter. This cooperative binding requires the POZ domain of BCL-6. Furthermore, activated Stat6 molecules can displace BCL-6 from one of these binding sites. These data demonstrate that cooperative interaction between BCL-6 molecules is required for repression of the Iϵ promoter.

Accordingly, much attention has been focused on determining the factors responsible for the pathogenesis of these malignancies. A surprisingly high number of diffuse large cell and follicular lymphomas have translocations involving a gene termed BCL-6/LAZ3 (2.Ye B.H. Rao P.H. Chaganti R.S. Dalla-Favera R.

BCL-6 encodes a 706-amino acid site-specific transcriptional repressor with an N-terminal POZ domain and six C-terminal zinc finger DNA-binding motifs.

Gene targeting studies have demonstrated that disruption of BCL-6 through homologous recombination results in a striking Th2-type inflammatory disease (8.Dent A.L. Shaffer A.L. Yu X. Allman D.

These reports indicate an important role for BCL-6 in the normal regulation of signaling events downstream of IL-4 and other cytokines responsible for the generation of Th2 responses. Modulation of chemokine expression provides another potential avenue of immune system regulation by BCL-6, which has been implicated in the regulation of MCP-1, MCP-3, MRP-1, MIP-1a, and IP-10 (11.Shaffer A.L.

BCL-6 has also been implicated in the control of plasma cell development through the repression of Blimp-1, an important regulator of this process (16.Reljic R. Wagner S.D. Peakman L.J. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1841-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA chip analysis has identified a number of genes involved in lymphocyte differentiation and cell cycle regulation as targets of repression by BCL-6 (11.Shaffer A.L. Yu X. He Y. Boldrick J. Chan E.P. Staudt L.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 199-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The observation that an in vitro defined binding site for BCL-6 resembles the STAT 1The abbreviations used are: STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; mIϵ, murine Iϵ; C/EBPβ, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein. consensus sequence suggests a mechanism for BCL-6 modulation of cytokine signaling whereby BCL-6 is targeted to cytokine-regulated genes by a recognition element shared between the repressor and the STAT proteins responsible for transducing cytokine-activated transcription pathways. In a previous study, we presented evidence suggesting that BCL-6 regulates the expression of a specific subset of Stat6-dependent genes (17.Harris M.B. Chang C.C. Berton M.T. Danial N.N. Zhang J. Kuehner D. Ye B.H. Kvatyuk M. Pandolfi P.P. Cattoretti G. Dalla-Favera R. Rothman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7264-7275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, BCL-6 was shown to modulate transcription of the murine germline ϵ promoter, but not the CD23b promoter. Lymphochip analysis of genes regulated by BCL-6 provides additional support for the argument that CD23 is not repressed by BCL-6 (11.Shaffer A.L. Yu X. He Y. Boldrick J. Chan E.P. Staudt L.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 199-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the selective activity of BCL-6 is not known. However, preliminary studies have revealed two characteristics of the germline ϵ promoter that may contribute to its ability to act as a target of BCL-6-mediated repression. The first is the relative strength of the BCL-6-binding site at mIϵ -111/-102 compared with its putative binding site in the CD23b promoter, as assessed by unlabeled competition experiments (17.Harris M.B. Chang C.C. Berton M.T. Danial N.N. Zhang J. Kuehner D. Ye B.H. Kvatyuk M. Pandolfi P.P. Cattoretti G. Dalla-Favera R. Rothman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7264-7275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, as described in this report, DNase I footprinting assays indicate the presence of two additional BCL-6-binding elements in the mIϵ promoter. These findings suggest two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses regarding target selection by BCL-6. On the one hand, the cumulative affinities of individual BCL-6-binding elements for a promoter may determine the ability of BCL-6 to regulate transcription of a given promoter. Alternatively, the presence of multiple recognition sites may drive BCL-6 binding via cooperative interactions between BCL-6 molecules bound to a responsive promoter. Cooperative binding requires a domain capable of associating with other proteins in a homo- or heterotypic fashion. The POZ domain is a 120-amino acid motif generally found at the extreme N terminus of broad-complex, traintrack and bric-a-brac/POZ proteins. Family members demonstrate extensive homology throughout the length of this hydrophobic domain, with 30–50% conservation of amino acid sequence identity (18.Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 19.Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Prive G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12123-12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Numerous overexpression studies have catalogued the ability of POZ domain-containing proteins to form homo- or heterodimers; furthermore, the POZ domain is suspected to mediate the formation of larger oligomeric structures in vivo (4.Baron B.W.

The recently solved crystal structure of the POZ domain of PLZF (a zinc finger transcription factor implicated in retinoic acid-unresponsive acute promyelocytic leukemia) revealed the PLZF dimer to be considerably more stable than the monomeric form, confirming the multimeric association of the POZ domain (19.Ahmad K.F.

Marmorstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27324-27329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic dimerization interface of the PLZF POZ domain is extensively distributed throughout the domain and involves ∼25% of the monomer surface area in a tightly intertwined dimer, as is characteristic for an obligate homodimer (19.Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Prive G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12123-12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, both biochemical and structural studies indicate a role for the POZ domain in mediating multimeric protein-protein interactions. In this study, we investigate the cooperative and competitive associations of BCL-6 with the murine germline ϵ promoter. Our observations suggest a mechanism for BCL-6-mediated repression that is dependent upon its ability to cooperatively bind to multiple promoter elements in a manner that requires the presence of an intact POZ domain. We further demonstrate the ability of Stat6 and C/EBPβ to efficiently compete with BCL-6 for binding to a shared site in the mIϵ promoter. These findings support a model of germline ϵ promoter transcriptional regulation in which basal repression mediated by BCL-6 is relieved in an activation-dependent manner through the competitive displacement of BCL-6 by positively acting transcription factors. Plasmid Construction—The eukaryotic expression vector pMT2T-BCL-6, wild-type germ line ϵ promoter -167/+55, and the S2mut (S2m4) mutant-driven reporters have been described (17.Harris M.B. Chang C.C.

The S3mut (S3m1) mutant was generated using the wild-type mIϵ promoter -167/+55 construct as a template in PCR using the following primers: S3m1-5′, ataac gcgtC AGGTG TGTCa gCTAG AAAGAG; and mIϵ-3′, tttagatctC CCCTG TGCAG GCT. The products of these reactions were cloned into the MluI and BglII sites of the pGL2-basic vector (Promega). All sequences were verified by automated sequencing at the DNA sequencing facility of Columbia University. The baculovirus transfer vectors for His-tagged full-length BCL-6 or the 120-amino acid ΔPOZ deletion mutant were generated using the pMT2T-BCL-6 construct as a template in a PCR using a common 3′-primer and the following 5′-primers: BCL-6, ttagatctATGGC CTCCC CGGCT GAC (derived from nucleotides 1–18 of the BCL-6 coding sequence); ΔPOZ, aaagatctTGCCG GAAGT TTATT AAG (derived from nucleotides 361–378 of the BCL-6 coding sequence); and 3′-BCL-6, aaagatctTCAGC AGGCT TTGGG GAG (derived from nucleotides 2103–2121 of the BCL-6 coding sequence). The products of these reactions were cloned into the BglII site of the pBlueBacHis2B baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen). All sequences were verified by automated sequencing at the DNA sequencing facility of Columbia University. Infection-competent recombinant baculoviral DNA was generated by cotransfection of transfer vectors and Bac-N-Blue DNA (Invitrogen) in Sf9 cells following the manufacturer's protocol. The baculovirus expression vector for Stat6 was obtained from Dr. Michael Berton. The Jak3 baculovirus was the gift of Dr. John Krolewski. EMSA—Preparation of total cell extracts from Mutu I, Mutu III, and M12 lines was performed by a Nonidet P-40 lysis method as described previously (27.Rothman P. Kreider B. Azam M. Levy D. Wegenka U. Eilers A. Decker T. Horn F. Kashleva H. Ihle J. Schindler C. Immunity. 1994; 1: 456-468Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). EMSA and antibody-mediated supershift assays were performed as described (26.Chang C.C. Ye B.H. Chaganti R.S. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), except that EMSA reaction buffer contained 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,10 μm ZnCl2, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 4% glycerol. For competition assays, the indicated amount of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added 15 min prior to addition of the labeled probe. The following probes were used in these experiments: mIϵ S1, 5′-gatcTGGGC ATGAA TTAAT GGTTA CTAGA; mIϵ S2, 5′-agctAACTT CCCAA GAACA; and mIϵ S3, 5′-gatCAGGT GTGTC TCCTA GAAAG AGGCCT CACCT GA. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—For generation of the recombinant BCL-6 and ΔPOZ proteins, Sf9 cells (20 × 106/30-cm tissue culture dish) were infected with 0.5 ml of high titer recombinant baculovirus. Phosphorylated Stat6 was generated by co-infection of Sf9 cells (20 × 106/30-cm tissue culture dish) with 1 ml of high titer recombinant Stat6 baculovirus and 0.5 ml of high titer recombinant Jak3 baculovirus. Cells were harvested at 48 (BCL-6) or 72 (ΔPOZ and Stat6) h post-infection, pelleted, and subjected to one freezethaw cycle. Cells (10 × 106/ml) were then lysed in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer). The lysates were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen Inc.) by batch purification. Briefly, 100 μl (BCL-6) or 150 μl (ΔPOZ and Stat6) of the beads were rotated for 1–1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer (2× bed volume) and three times with wash buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.0), 40 mm (BCL-6 and ΔPOZ) or 30 mm (Stat6) imidazole, and 20% glycerol. Recombinant protein was eluted in buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.0), 250 mm imidazole, and 20% glycerol. Following elution, the protein was dialyzed in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Aliquots of the recovered proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and protein purity and concentration were estimated by Western blotting with anti-His antibody and Coomassie Blue staining. DNase I Footprinting—Expression and purification of the recombinant proteins used in these assays were as described above. For footprinting experiments, wild-type and mutant germ line ϵ promoter fragments (-167 to +55) were end-labeled on the noncoding strand. The probes (5000 cpm) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with the indicated amounts of purified recombinant proteins using the Amersham Biosciences Biotech SureTrack footprinting system as described previously (17.Harris M.B. Chang C.C. Berton M.T. Danial N.N. Zhang J. Kuehner D. Ye B.H. Kvatyuk M. Pandolfi P.P. Cattoretti G. Dalla-Favera R. Rothman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7264-7275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Lines, Transient Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assays—M12.4.1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells (5 × 106) were transfected by electroporation as described (28.Gauss G.H. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6739-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The transfection mixture contained 5 μg of either germ line ϵ promoter -167/+55-luciferase reporter construct or mutant germ line ϵ promoter-luciferase reporter construct (S2mut or S3mut as described above), 0.5 μg of pRL Renilla reporter plasmid (Promega), and the indicated amount of BCL-6 expression construct. Vector DNA (pMT2T) was added as necessary to achieve a constant amount of transfected DNA. Following transfection, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 units/ml murine recombinant IL-4 for 24 h. After 24 h, the luciferase activity of cells transfected with the germ line ϵ reporter was measured. Transfection efficiency was normalized relative to Renilla activity. Characterization of a Novel BCL-6-binding Element within the mIϵ Promoter—Initial DNase I footprinting studies of the murine germline ϵ promoter using the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of BCL-6 fused to GST (GST-BCL-6ZF) and purified Stat6 demonstrated the ability of these proteins to protect an overlapping region of the promoter at -111 to -102 relative to the transcriptional start site (17.Harris M.B. Chang C.C. Berton M.T. Danial N.N. Zhang J. Kuehner D. Ye B.H. Kvatyuk M. Pandolfi P.P. Cattoretti G. Dalla-Favera R. Rothman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7264-7275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional footprinting assays of the mIϵ promoter suggested the presence of two additional BCL-6-binding sites: one at the transcriptional start site (S1) and another (S3) located ∼50 bp upstream of the BCL-6/Stat6 site at -111 to -102 (S2) (Fig. 1). Previous linker scanning studies demonstrated the importance of these regions in maintaining a low basal level of transcription of the mIϵ promoter (29.Delphin S. Stavnezer J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, although the significance of the initiation site is understood, no transcription factor has yet been shown to bind within the 5′-sequence in either the murine or human germline ϵ promoter. Careful analysis of this region revealed an element at -157 to -149 that resembles the core sequence of the artificial BCL-6-binding site identified by cyclic amplification and selection of targets PCR (B6BS). However, the B6BS-like site found in the mIϵ promoter lacks a critical thymidine that is thought to confer STAT binding activity to B6BS (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2mIϵ S3 is a high affinity binding site of BCL-6.A, shown is a sequence comparison of the in vitro defined BCL-6-binding site (B6BS) and three potential BCL-6-binding sites (S1–S3) within murine germline ϵ promoter -167/+55. B, two Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cell lines that differentially express BCL-6, Mutu I (BCL-6-positive), and Mutu III (BCL-6-negative) were cultured in the presence or absence of human recombinant IL-4 (10 units/ml) for 1 h prior to harvest. EMSAs were performed using 5 μg of whole cell extract and an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to germline ϵ promoter -156/-147 (S3). The DNA-binding complexes were identified upon supershift with antibody (Ab) to BCL-6 (αBCL-6). Supershift with antibody to Stat6 (αStat6) is shown for comparison. C, the affinity of BCL-6 for mIϵ S3 at -156 to -147 of the germline ϵ promoter relative to the two other mIϵ promoter BCL-6-binding sites was assessed in unlabeled competition assays. Whole cell extract (5 μg) prepared from the BCL-6-positive M12.4.1 murine B cell lymphoma line was incubated with a labeled probe generated from Iϵ S3 (-156 to -147) in the absence (lanes 1, 7, and 13) or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides (3, 10, 30, 60, and 100 ng): mIϵ S3 (lanes 2–6), mIϵ S2 (lanes 8–12), and mIϵ S1 (lanes 14–18).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the ability of BCL-6 and Stat6 to recognize this region of the murine germline ϵ promoter, an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to mIϵ -167/-135 was generated and used in EMSA. The probe was labeled and incubated with whole cell extracts prepared from either the Mutu I (BCL-6-positive) or Mutu III (BCL-6-negative) cell line. These cells had been cultured for 1 h prior to harvest in either the absence or presence of IL-4 (to induce the phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of Stat6). These extracts have previously been shown to have Stat6 binding activity (17.Harris M.B. Chang C.C. Berton M.T. Danial N.N. Zhang J. Kuehner D. Ye B.H. Kvatyuk M. Pandolfi P.P. Cattoretti G. Dalla-Favera R. Rothman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7264-7275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA analysis of extracts prepared from the BCL-6-positive Mutu I cell line and incubated with the mIϵ -167/-135 probe revealed a single complex absent in EMSAs performed with extracts from the BCL-6-negative Mutu III cells (Fig. 2B). This constitutive complex was ablated upon incubation with an antiserum specific to BCL-6, but remained intact following incubation with preimmune serum, confirming that this complex contains BCL-6. The absence of an IL-4-induced complex in extracts prepared from either the Mutu I or Mutu III cell line, as well as the lack of a complex sensitive to incubation with antiserum specific to Stat6, indicates the inability of Stat6 to bind to this region of the mIϵ promoter. As we had previously demonstrated a correlation between the strength of BCL-6 interaction with its binding site within a promoter and the efficiency of BCL-6 repression of promoter activity (17.Harris M.B. Chang C.C. Berton M.T. Danial N.N. Zhang J. Kuehner D. Ye B.H. Kvatyuk M. Pandolfi P.P. Cattoretti G. Dalla-Favera R. Rothman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7264-7275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wished to compare the affinity of BCL-6 for the S1, S2, and S3 binding sites found in the murine germline ϵ promoter. Unlabeled oligonucleotides derived from these three potential BCL-6 sites were assessed for their ability to compete for BCL-6 binding with a labeled probe generated from the 5′-BCL-6 recognition element of the mIϵ promoter (S3). Extracts prepared from cells of the murine B lymphoma line M12.4.1 were incubated with labeled S3 probe and increasing concentrations of the appropriate unlabeled competitor, and the reaction products were analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 2C). The results demonstrate that S2 and S3 competed for binding to the labeled probe with comparable efficiency, indicating that S3, like S2, is a high affinity binding site for BCL-6. However, the binding element at the transcriptional start site (S1) was unable to compete for BCL-6 binding within the range of concentrations used in this assay, and it may therefore be considered a weak binding site for BCL-6. These experiments define a novel BCL-6 recognition element within the murine germline ϵ promoter. Interestingly, this sequence is the first reported BCL-6-binding element that does not also serve as a Stat6-binding site. Furthermore, unlabeled competition studies reveal a hierarchy of affinity for BCL-6 among the three potential binding sites for BCL-6 found within the mIϵ promoter, whereby the two most 5′ sites (S2 and S3) strongly bind BCL-6, and the 3′-element found at the transcriptional initiation site (S1) binds BCL-6 only weakly. Repression of the mIϵ Promoter by BCL-6 Requires Multiple BCL-6-binding Sites—The experiments detailed above describe the presence of multiple binding sites for BCL-6 in the murine germline ϵ promoter. It remained uncertain, however, whether the presence of these additional binding sites is required for the efficient repression of promoter activity by BCL-6. To explore the functional significance of the BCL-6-binding site at -156 to -147, we created a series of mutants within the context of the IL-4-responsive region of murine germline ϵ promoter -167/+55 in which the binding of BCL-6 to S2, S3, or both sites was disrupted (S2mut, S3mut, and S2/S3mut, respectively). Stat6 binding to S2 remained intact in the S2 mutant as described previously (17.Harris M.B. Chang C.C. Berton M.T. Danial N.N. Zhang J. Kuehner D. Ye B.H. Kvatyuk M. Pandolfi P.P. Cattoretti G. Dalla-Favera R. Rothman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7264-7275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These promoter mutants were used to drive a luciferase reporter in transient transfection assays. The constructs were cotransfected with either a control plasmid or a BCL-6 expression vector into M12.4.1 murine B lymphoma cells. Fig. 3B demonstrates the results of experiments using a single concentration (2.5 μg) of BCL-6, whereas Fig. 3C shows a dose-response curve with increasing concentrations of BCL-6. Transfected cells were cultured either alone or in the presence of IL-4 for 24 h and then harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Interestingly, the S3 mutants, and perhaps also the S2 mutants, were hyperactivated upon cytokine induction, perhaps due to the inability of endogenous BCL-6 to bind to the mutant promoter (Fig. 3B). As expected, cotransfection with BCL-6 resulted in repression of the IL-4-induced activation of the wild-type promoter. In contrast, the ability of BCL-6 to repress IL-4-induced transcription of the mIϵ promoter bearing a mutant S2 BCL-6-binding site was compromised (Fig. 3, B and C). The ability of BCL-6 to repress IL-4-induced transcription of the mIϵ promoter mutated at S3 was variably decreased, although never to the levels of the S2 mutant (Fig. 3, B and C). Like the S3 mutant, the S2/S3 double mutant showed markedly increased levels of i"

Integration of breast tumor gene expression data with the genes in the tumor suppressor p53 signaling pathway yielded 128 genes whose expression is altered in breast tumor cell lines and in response to p53 expression. A hierarchical cluster analysis of the 128 genes revealed that a significant portion of genes demonstrate an opposing expression pattern, i.e. p53-activated genes are down-regulated in the breast tumor lines, whereas p53-repressed genes are up-regulated. Most of these genes are involved in cell cycle regulation and/or apoptosis, consistent with the tumor suppressor function of p53. Follow-up studies on one gene, RAI3, suggested that p53 interacts with the promoter of RAI3 and repressed its expression at the onset of apoptosis. The expression of RAI3 is elevated in most tumor cell lines expressing mutant p53, whereas RAI3 mRNA is relatively repressed in the tumor cell lines expressing wild-type p53. Furthermore, ectopic expression of RAI3 in 293 cells promotes anchorage-independent growth and small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of RAI3 in AsPc-1 pancreatic tumor cells induces cell morphological change. Taken together, these data suggest a role for RAI3 in tumor growth and demonstrate the predictive power of integrative genomics.

The expression of RAI3 is elevated in most tumor cell lines expressing mutant p53, whereas RAI3 mRNA is relatively repressed in the tumor cell lines expressing wild-type p53. Furthermore, ectopic expression of RAI3 in 293 cells promotes anchorage-independent growth and small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of RAI3 in AsPc-1 pancreatic tumor cells induces cell morphological change. Taken together, these data suggest a role for RAI3 in tumor growth and demonstrate the predictive power of integrative genomics. Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer diagnosis, with an estimated 12% of women worldwide being at risk of developing the disease at some time in their lives (1.Salorafas G.H. Tsiotou A.G. Br. J. Surg. 2000; 87: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Breast cancer is the second major cause of cancer death in women overall and the leading cause in women 40–55 years old (2.Winer E.P. Morrow M. Osborne C.K. Harris J.R. DeVita Jr., V.T. Hellman S.

Recently, high throughput gene expression technology has revolutionized our ability to simultaneously monitor expression of thousands of genes in the human genome. The power of genome-wide gene expression analysis has been demonstrated by using characteristic patterns of gene expression to reclassify breast tumors into clinically relevant subgroups (4.Sorlie T.

Although the reclassification of breast tumor subtypes provides striking initial examples, these advances have not yet yielded novel targets for breast cancer drug discovery. Target identification is limited, in part, by our understanding of the pathways involved with the cancer-associated genes. New approaches are required to take full advantage of the genomics revolution.Deregulation of the p53 pathway occurs as a common event in most if not all types of human cancers. Alterations in p53 protein were observed to be the single most adverse prognostic indicator for both recurrence and death in breast cancer (10.Borresen-Dale A.L. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The biochemical activity of p53 that is most closely associated with tumor suppression is its function as a transcription factor. The transcriptional targets of p53 form a network involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, DNA repair, differentiation, senescence, and development (11.Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5743) Google Scholar). Therefore, integration of the p53 pathway with the cancer-associated genes will assist in the identification of putative oncogenes with functional relevance.In our previous work, we have investigated p53 target genes in the human genome using bioinformatics and microarray approaches (12.Mirza A.

In this study, we determined the expression profile of normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells 1The GEO numbers of microarray data are as follows: GSM38895, GSM38896, GSM38897, GSM38898, GSM38899, GSM38900, GSM38901, GSM38902, GSM38903, GSM38904.1The GEO numbers of microarray data are as follows: GSM38895, GSM38896, GSM38897, GSM38898, GSM38899, GSM38900, GSM38901, GSM38902, GSM38903, GSM38904. and integrated the data with the microarray data that identify p53-responsive genes as well as the p53 target data base. We observed striking opposing expression patterns between the genes showing aberrant expression in breast tumor cells and the genes transcriptionally regulated by p53. Most of these genes are involved in cell cycle regulation and cell death, consistent with p53 tumor suppressor function. Follow-up studies on one gene, RAI3 (an alternative name, RAIG1), suggested that RAI3 is a novel p53 transcriptional target gene and growth-promoting gene, agreed with the prediction of integrative genomics.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Human breast cancer cell lines T47D, MCF7, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-468, BT-20, BT-549, BT-474, and SK-BR-3, human pancreatic tumor cell line AsPc-1, and human cervical epithelioid tumor cell line HeLa were obtained from American Type Cell Collection (ATCC). 2774qw1 is a single clone derived from human ovarian tumor cell line 2774, which was obtained from ATCC (14.Wu Q.

(Walkersville, MD). They were cultured from reduction mammoplasty and grown in short term culture. Culture conditions of all cell lines or primary cells followed the instruction from ATCC or Clonetics.RNA Isolation and Microarray Hybridization—Cells were harvested after passages 1–3 from Clonetics or ATCC stock. RNA preparation and microarray hybridization were performed as described previously (12.Mirza A. Wu Q. Wang L. McClanahan T. Bishop W.R. Gheyas F. Ding W. Hutchins B. Hockenberry T. Kirschmeier P.

All measurements were done in at least two independent experiments each of which was done in triplicate. Sequences of the primers and probes for epithelium-specific transcription factor-1b, integrin α3, integrin α6, RAI3, and human 23 kDa highly basic protein (23-kDa HBP) gene, obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, are listed in supplementary information S1. The results were normalized such that the value of human 23-kDa HBP gene expression was 10,000 in each sample.Statistical Analysis—The differentially expressed genes from microarray experiments were grouped according to the similarity of their expression patterns using a hierarchical clustering method described by Eisen et al. (15.Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13132) Google Scholar). The clustering algorithm was implemented using the software package S-PLUS (Mathsoft Inc., Seattle, WA).Integration of Microarray Data with the p53 Target Data Base—To identify the genes that were activated in breast tumor cells and repressed by p53, the microarray data from 8 human breast tumor cell lines as well as human mammary epithelial cells from three donors were combined with another set of microarray data that identified p53-responsive genes (13.Wang L.

The detailed methodology was described in details elsewhere (16.Liu S. Mirza A. Wang L. Schönthal A.H. Methods in Molecular Biology, Checkpoint Controls and Cancer: Methods and Protocols. 2. Humana, Totowa, NJ2004: 33-54Google Scholar).Cell Cycle Analysis—HeLa cells, obtained from ATCC, were treated with 400 μm mimosine, 2 mm thymidine, or 0.4 μg/ml nocodazole for 16 h at 37 °C, respectively. The chemicals were all obtained from Sigma. The synchronized cells were fixed and processed for cell cycle analysis as described previously (14.Wu Q. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T. Yang T.-Y. Brassard D.L. Wang L. McClanahan T. Black S. Rizzi G. Musco-Hobkinson M.L. Mirza A. Liu S. J. Biol.

The ChIP assays were performed as described previously (13.Wang L. Wu Q. Qiu P. Mirza A. McGuirk M. Kirschmeier P. Greene J.R. Wang Y. Pickett C.B. Liu S. J. Biol.

The sequences of primers and probes used in the ChIP assays, obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, are listed in supplementary information S6.RNA-mediated Interference Experiments—Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were purchased from Sequitur, Inc. (Boston, MA). The transfection of siRNA was performed on 30–50% confluent cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cellular delivery of siRNA was optimized with various doses and post-transfection time using fluorescein isothiocyanate-siRNA (Sequitur, Inc., Boston, MA). Five different siRNAs targeting RAI3 were tested, and one of them that showed greatest gene knocked down effect was chosen for further study. Double-stranded siRNAs against RAI3 were introduced into AsPc-1 pancreatic tumor cells by performing three successive transfections of siRNA (85 nm) at 5-day intervals to visualize the cell morphology change. Experiments were repeated in three independent studies, and each study was performed in triplicate. mRNA in siRNA-transfected samples analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR were normalized with respect to the 23-kDa HBP expression level. The toxicity of cells transfected with siRNA was assessed by cell viability.Establishment of 293 Cells Stably Expressing RAI3 Receptor—Serum-free medium-adapted HEK-293 F cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with the N-terminal FLAG-tagged RAI3 cDNA in pME18 vector using Effectent reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and, at 48 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced using selection medium (growth medium plus 0.5 mg/ml G418). The stable surface expression of RAI3 receptors in HEK-293 F was then confirmed by FACS analysis after being grown on selection medium for 2 weeks.Analysis of Surface Expression of RAI3—RAI3 receptor expression on the cell surface was determined by flow cytometric analysis using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cells were harvested in 5 mm EDTA in PBSF (PBS free of Ca2+ and Mg2+), washed once with PBSF, and stained with biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution) (Sigma) or stained with biotinylated mouse IgG1, K (1:5 dilution) (Pharmingen), for 20 min. After being washed once with PBSF, the cells were then stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen) (1:1,000 dilution) for 20 min and washed twice with PBSF before being analyzed by FACS Calibur flow cytometer.Soft Agar Experiments—Soft agar assays were performed in 6-well dishes by seeding 1,000, 2,500, or 5,000 cells in each well. Cells were plated in top 0.35% low melting point agarose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum over a bottom 0.6% low melting point agarose feeding layer. Cells were grown for ∼2 weeks, and colonies were stained with 1% MTT in phosphate-buffered saline. The plates were then scanned, and the colony area was quantified as the sum of the areas stained by MTT. The statistical significance of the soft agar data was analyzed by Student's t test.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDifferentially Expressed Transcripts in Breast Tumor Cells— One aim of this study is to identify genes in normal HMECs that become activated during malignant transformation. Although the approach of differential hybridization analysis is powerful, an appropriate model system is an essential prerequisite. Most cancers originate from epithelial tissues in which oncogenes are activated or tumor-suppressor genes are lost. Such genetically abnormal epithelium is supported by normal stromal cells that become activated during tumor progression to produce proteases, inhibitors, and other regulatory factors. Therefore, it is imperative to start with human malignant mammary epithelial cells. In this study, eight well established human breast cancer epithelial cell lines from ATCC were chosen to use in the microarray experiments: MCF-7, T47D, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-468, BT-20, BT-474, BT-549, and SK-BR-3. A reliable source of normal HMECs is critical, because the differential expression analysis would be made between probe pairs from malignant mammary epithelial cell lines against normal primary mammary epithelial cells. We used primary normal HMEC from 3 donors (HMEC21, HMEC41, and HMEC50) cultured from reduction mammoplasty and grown in short term culture. The molecular characterization of cells and cell lines used in microarray experiments is shown in supplementary information S2 and S3.The mRNA isolated from HMEC50 was labeled with the fluorescent dye, Cy5, and used in all probe pairs as a common reference, and the mRNA isolated from other cells or cell lines was labeled with fluorescent dye, Cy3. The labeled cDNAs from each probe pair were mixed and hybridized to the cDNA microarray as described under “Methods and Materials.” The microarrays, Incyte GeneAlbum 1–6, used for the hybridization consisted of 65,873 cDNA clones (57,172 clones excluding controls), representing 33,515 individual genes. 59,579 of 65,873 elements (90%) on microarrays gave signals.1 Most transcripts were expressed at similar levels in normal and malignant mammary cells. 17,635 cDNAs showed ≥2.0-fold expression level change, 7,273 cDNAs showed ≥2.5-fold expression level change, and 3,152 cDNAs showed ≥3.0-fold expression level change in any of human breast cancer cell lines as compared with HMEC50. The hybridization results for each probe pair are shown in Table I.Table IDistribution of differentially expressed genes in breast tumor cell linesProbe 2aThe common probe 1 is HMEC50No. of cDNAs that exhibit differential expressionbMinimum differential expression is a 3.0-fold change as compared with HMEC50HMEC4122HMEC21105T47D1152MCF7857ZR-75-1677MB-468486BT-20695BT-474876SK-BR-3418BT-549863a The common probe 1 is HMEC50b Minimum differential expression is a 3.0-fold change as compared with HMEC50 Open table in a new tab To validate the reliability of the changes we observed from microarray hybridization, we checked expression profile of known breast cancer-associated genes. For example, the human tyrosine kinase type 2 receptor (HER2) was identified as overexpressed in SK-BR-3 and BT-474 breast tumor cell lines (17.Harwerth I.-M. Wels W. Marte B.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Shawver L.K. Mann E. Elliger S.S. Dugger T.C. Arteaga C.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1367PubMed Google Scholar). It was observed that HER2 exhibited 7.4-, 11.3-, 7.5-, and 11.8-fold changes in SK-BR-3 breast tumor cells and 7.0-, 10.8-, 18.4-, and 10.1-fold changes in BT-474 breast tumor cells as compared with normal HMEC50 cells from four individual clones on the microarrays. HER2 was also found to be overexpressed in ZR-75-1 breast tumor cell line (3.0-, 2.5-, 4.0-, and 2.6-fold change from four individual clones on the microarrays). This has not being previously reported in the literature. In addition, overexpression of the estrogen-inducible pS2 gene was observed in MCF-7 (44.0-fold change) and ZR-75-1 (3.0-fold change) breast tumor cell lines, not in other breast tumor cell lines (e.g. BT-20 and T47D), or the normal epithelial mammary cells from three donors. This result agreed with observations made in other laboratories (19.Zajchowski D. Band V. Paauzie N. Tager A. Stampfer M. Sager R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 7041-7047PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we measured mRNA levels of several genes, including epithelium-specific transcription factor-1b, integrin α3, and integrin α6, by TaqMan RT-PCR analysis using the same RNA samples used in microarray hybridizations (data not shown). In general, these two independent quantitation methods gave very similar results.Distinct Gene Expression Patterns between Tumor and Normal Cells Analyzed by Hierarchical Cluster Method—Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the basis of similarities in their overall patterns of gene expression measured over the group of 8 breast tumor cell lines as well as normal mammary epithelial cells, HMEC21 and HMEC40, versus HMEC50 as a common reference (Fig. 1). 2,108 elements or cDNAs on the microarrays used in the analysis were differentially expressed with at least or equal to 3.0-fold change at one or more probes and had not more than 1 missing value of 10 data points (supplementary information S4). Estrogen receptor-positive breast tumor cell lines, T47D, MCF7, BT-474 and ZR-75-1, were clustered together in the bottom branch of the dendrogram. Whereas estrogen receptor-negative breast tumor cell lines, MDA-MB-468, BT-20, SK-BR-3, and BT-549 exhibited less relatedness. As expected, normal mammary epithelial cells from two donors were found to group together and have the least relatedness as compared with the breast tumor cell lines. Therefore, unsupervised clustering methods were able to distinguish between tumor and normal cells and breast tumors are classified, to some extent, on the basis of estrogen receptor status. This is in agreement with recent reports (4.Sorlie T. Perou C.M. Tibshirani R. Aas T. Geisler S. Johnsen H. Hastie T. Eisen M.B. van de Rijn M. Jeffrey S.S. Thorsen T. Quist H. Matese J.C. Brown P.O.

He Y.D. Hart A.A. Mao M. Peterse H.L. van der Kooy K. Marton M.J. Witteveen A.T. Schreiber G.J. Kerkhoven R.M. Roberts C. Linsley P.S. Bernards R. Friend S.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (7692) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the breast tumor cell lines, BT-549, exhibited the least relatedness to any other tumor cell line as shown in the dendrogram (Fig. 1). It was previously suggested that the origin of the BT-549 breast cancer cell line was more stromal rather than epithelial by cluster analysis (6.Perou C.M. Sorlie T. Eisen M.B. van de Rijn M. Jeffrey S.S. Rees C.A. Pollack J.R. Ross D.T. Johnson H. Akslen L.A. Fluge O. Pergamen-schikov A. Williams C. Zhu S.X. Lonning P.E. Borresen-Dale A.-L. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Nature. 2000; 406: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (11476) Google Scholar). Notably, elevated expression of epithelium-specific transcription factor-1b in all epithelial breast tumor cell lines but not in BT-549 breast tumor cell line was observed, supporting this notion.We further clustered the elements or cDNAs on the microarray on the basis of similarity of their expression patterns (Fig. 1). We observed that multiple independent clones or cDNA representing the same gene usually clustered together, either very near each other or immediately adjacent to each other. These independent clones were mostly spotted on different locations on the microarrays. The genes in the clusters are listed in supplementary information S4.An interesting feature of the gene expression patterns of 156 cDNAs seen in the uppermost portion of the dendrogram (Fig. 1, cluster A) is their similar gene expression level among normal epithelial mammary cells from different donors and their up-regulation of expression in most breast tumor cell lines, suggesting that this pattern may identify genes involved in the process of tumorigenesis. This set included many genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell cycle checkpoint, DNA synthesis, and DNA replication as well as the proliferation-associated antigen Ki-67, which is often used to gauge the proliferation index of a tumor biopsy. Cluster B, consisting of 30 cDNAs, showed a unique gene expression pattern. The genes in this distinctive cluster included many extracellular matrix proteins and were expressed at high levels only in BT-549 stromal cell line (Fig. 1). The other interesting cluster, cluster C (Fig. 1), at the lowermost portion of the dendrogram, consists of 145 elements or cDNAs. This cluster includes several HMEC molecular markers (laminin-5 β3 and α3b, cytokeratins types 2, 5, 6, 15, 16, and 17, and type I epidermal keratin). These genes were down-regulated in malignant mammary cells as compared with normal HMECs, consistent with previous reports (4.Sorlie T. Perou C.M. Tibshirani R. Aas T. Geisler S. Johnsen H. Hastie T. Eisen M.B. van de Rijn M. Jeffrey S.S. Thorsen T. Quist H. Matese J.C. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Eystein Lonning P. Borresen-Dale A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10869-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (8416) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is no differential expression of these genes observed among normal epithelial mammary cells from three donors.Identification of Breast Tumor-associated Genes in the p53 Pathway—We observed that a significant portion of genes exhibited differential expression in breast tumor cells as compared with their normal counterpart. How the expression levels of thousands of genes are regulated in tumors remains a significant challenge in tumor biology. Central to this mechanism are transcription factors, including the p53 tumor suppressor protein. A perturbation in function of the p53 protein is one of the most common features associated with human cancer (11.Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5743) Google Scholar). In breast cancer, p53 mutation has been found to be an early event in breast tumorigenesis and is associated with rapid proliferation and poor prognosis (10.Borresen-Dale A.L. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).In our previous work, parallel microarray experiments were carried out with the same set of Incyte GeneAlbum microarrays using mRNA isolated from a human ovarian tumor cell line, 2774qw1 cells at various times post-infection with 1010 particles/ml rAd-p53 or rAd-vector (12.Mirza A. Wu Q. Wang L. McClanahan T. Bishop W.R. Gheyas F. Ding W. Hutchins B. Hockenberry T. Kirschmeier P. Greene J.R. Liu S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 1,501 genes were found to respond to p53 expression at one or more time points using a 2.5-fold change as a cutoff. To identify the genes that show differential expression in breast tumor cells and respond to p53 expression, the microarray data derived from the breast tumor cell lines was combined with the microarray data derived from the p53-expressing human ovarian tumor cell line. We identified 128 cDNAs, for which transcript levels changed 3-fold or more in at least one breast tumor cell line and for which expression changed in at least one time point in response to p53 (supplementary information S5). The unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis grouped samples into four groups (Fig. 2A). Normal mammary epithelial cells from two donors (HMEC21 and HMEC41) and the sample from 2774qw1 cells at 4-h post-infection of rAd-p53 that show least differential expression grouped together. All other samples from 2774qw1 cells at 8–24-h post-infection of rAd-p53 were in the same cluster. Interestingly, estrogen receptor-positive breast tumor cell lines, T47D, MCF7, BT-474, and ZR-75-1, separated from estrogen receptor-negative breast tumor cell lines, MDA-MB-468, BT-20, and SK-BR-3. The BT-549 breast cancer cell line with more stromal tissue origin had least relatedness as compared with any other samples.Fig. 2Hierarchical cluster image showing opposing expression patterns of breast tumor associated genes and p53 responsive genes. 128 cDNAs on the microarrays were used in the cluster analysis. Criteria were differential expression of at least 3.0-fold changes at one or more probes as compared with the corresponding reference HMEC50 or sample infected with rAd-vector and not more than 1 miss"
https://openalex.org/W1970112406,"Topoisomerase (topo) IV and gyrase are bacterial type IIA DNA topoisomerases essential for DNA replication and chromosome segregation that act via a transient double-stranded DNA break involving a covalent enzyme-DNA “cleavage complex.” Despite their mechanistic importance, the DNA breakage determinants are not understood for any bacterial type II enzyme. We investigated DNA cleavage by Streptococcus pneumoniae topo IV and gyrase stabilized by gemifloxacin and other antipneumococcal fluoroquinolones. Topo IV and gyrase induce distinct but overlapping repertoires of double-strand DNA breakage sites that were essentially identical for seven different quinolones and were augmented (in intensity) by positive or negative supercoiling. Sequence analysis of 180 topo IV and 126 gyrase sites promoted by gemifloxacin on pneumococcal DNA revealed the respective consensus sequences: G(G/c)(A/t)A*GNNC t(T/a)N(C/a) and GN4 G(G/c)(A/c)G*GNNC t TN(C/a) (preferred bases are underlined; disfavored bases are in small capitals; N indicates no preference; and asterisk indicates DNA scission between -1 and +1 positions). Both enzymes show strong preferences for bases clustered symmetrically around the DNA scission site, i.e. +1G/+4C, -4G/+8C, and particularly the novel -2A/+6T, but with no preference at +2/+3 within the staggered 4-bp overhang. Asymmetric elements include -3G and several unfavored bases. These cleavage preferences, the first for Gram-positive type IIA topoisomerases, differ markedly from those reported for Escherichia coli topo IV (consensus (A/G)*T/A) and gyrase, which are based on fewer sites. However, both pneumococcal enzymes cleaved an E. coli gyrase site suggesting overlap in gyrase determinants. We propose a model for the cleavage complex of topo IV/gyrase that accommodates the unique -2A/+6T and other preferences. Topoisomerase (topo) IV and gyrase are bacterial type IIA DNA topoisomerases essential for DNA replication and chromosome segregation that act via a transient double-stranded DNA break involving a covalent enzyme-DNA “cleavage complex.” Despite their mechanistic importance, the DNA breakage determinants are not understood for any bacterial type II enzyme. We investigated DNA cleavage by Streptococcus pneumoniae topo IV and gyrase stabilized by gemifloxacin and other antipneumococcal fluoroquinolones. Topo IV and gyrase induce distinct but overlapping repertoires of double-strand DNA breakage sites that were essentially identical for seven different quinolones and were augmented (in intensity) by positive or negative supercoiling. Sequence analysis of 180 topo IV and 126 gyrase sites promoted by gemifloxacin on pneumococcal DNA revealed the respective consensus sequences: G(G/c)(A/t)A*GNNC t(T/a)N(C/a) and GN4 G(G/c)(A/c)G*GNNC t TN(C/a) (preferred bases are underlined; disfavored bases are in small capitals; N indicates no preference; and asterisk indicates DNA scission between -1 and +1 positions). Both enzymes show strong preferences for bases clustered symmetrically around the DNA scission site, i.e. +1G/+4C, -4G/+8C, and particularly the novel -2A/+6T, but with no preference at +2/+3 within the staggered 4-bp overhang. Asymmetric elements include -3G and several unfavored bases. These cleavage preferences, the first for Gram-positive type IIA topoisomerases, differ markedly from those reported for Escherichia coli topo IV (consensus (A/G)*T/A) and gyrase, which are based on fewer sites. However, both pneumococcal enzymes cleaved an E. coli gyrase site suggesting overlap in gyrase determinants. We propose a model for the cleavage complex of topo IV/gyrase that accommodates the unique -2A/+6T and other preferences. Type IIA DNA topoisomerases mediate the ATP-dependent transport of one DNA helix through another DNA segment via a transient enzyme-bridged double-strand break (1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2.Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 3.Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev.

This maneuver allows the control of DNA topology essential for a variety of DNA transactions, including DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. Bacteria usually express two essential type IIA enzymes, DNA topoisomerase (topo) 1The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol. IV and DNA gyrase (5.Drlica K. Zhao X. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 6.Levine C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), which were first identified in Escherichia coli (7.Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 8.Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Higara S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Gyrase is unique in catalyzing the negative supercoiling of closed circular DNA. It is believed to act ahead of replication forks promoting fork progression by removing the positive supercoils that arise during DNA unwinding (9.Zechiedrich E.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 9: 2859-2869Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). By contrast, topo IV relaxes positive and negative supercoils and has evolved as an efficient DNA decatenase with a specialized role in separating daughter chromosomes at cell division (9.Zechiedrich E.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 9: 2859-2869Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition to their biological functions, topo IV and gyrase are also targets for the quinolone class of antibacterial drugs (5.Drlica K. Zhao X. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 10.Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4772-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Topo IV and gyrase are tetrameric complexes comprising two subunits each of ParC and ParE, and GyrA and GyrB, respectively (5.Drlica K. Zhao X. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). The ParC and GyrA subunits are homologous in their N-terminal domain that carries the DNA breakage-reunion function but diverge in their C-terminal regions that also contribute to DNA binding (11.Corbett K.D. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The ParE and GyrB proteins contain the ATPase site involved in energy transduction and are closely homologous, both in primary sequence and structure. Early work established that gyrase and topo IV act by introducing a transient double-stranded break into DNA and passing a second helical segment through the break that is then resealed (12.Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Science. 1979; 206: 1081-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 13.Mizuuchi K. Fisher L.M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1847-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Following the mechanism first elaborated for yeast topo II (20.Espeli O. Marians K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), gyrase and topo IV are believed to catalyze DNA strand passage by functioning as an ATP-operated clamp. According to the model, the open enzyme clamp first binds a DNA segment, termed the “gate” or G segment, at a site formed by the breakage-reunion domains. Binding of ATP causes closure of the clamp capturing a second DNA helix, termed the T or “translocated” segment. In events coupled to ATP hydrolysis, the T segment is then passed through a transient double-strand DNA break in the G segment and is released by the opening of a protein gate, prior to the enzyme resetting to the open clamp form. The T and G segments may be part of the same DNA molecule leading to DNA supercoiling-relaxation or knotting-unknotting. Alternatively, the G and T segments may belong to different molecules allowing decatenation of interlocked DNA. For gyrase, it appears that wrapping of a 120–150-bp DNA region encompassing the DNA breakage site on the G segment favors intramolecular DNA strand passage producing DNA supercoiling (13.Mizuuchi K. Fisher L.M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1847-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14.Fisher L.M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Ohmori H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15.Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C.

A. 1981; 78: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas the absence of DNA wrapping on topo IV allows efficient intermolecular DNA passage and chromosome decatenation. Transient double-strand DNA breakage by topo IV and gyrase proceeds via an enzyme-DNA intermediate termed the “cleavage complex” involving a 4-bp staggered break and covalent attachment of ParC (GyrA) subunits to each 5′ DNA end through a phosphotyrosine linkage (with Tyr-122 in E. coli GyrA) (2.Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 5.Drlica K. Zhao X. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA linkage preserves the energy of the DNA phosphodiester bond and allows resealing of the DNA backbone by attack of the 3′-OH ends of the broken DNA. The breakage-reunion equilibrium is very much toward the sealed DNA (closed G gate), perhaps a safeguard against the inadvertent release of lethal double-stranded breaks in vivo. The cleavage complex is, however, stabilized by quinolones and is then detectable as a frank double-stranded DNA break on addition of a denaturant such as SDS. Unlike restriction enzymes, DNA cleavage occurs at specific although degenerate sequences and generates 5′ ends linked to ParC (GyrA) protein (14.Fisher L.M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Ohmori H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15.Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. Cell. 1981; 23: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16.Morrison A. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17.Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cleavage determinants are poorly understood. Even for E. coli gyrase, relatively few sites have been analyzed and compared. The most extensive analysis to date involved only 19 sites induced in E. coli on plasmid pBR322 and generated a 20-bp consensus (18.Lockshon D. Morris D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear if all these sites are highly preferred. Much less is known about the cleavage specificity of topo IV. In the one study thus far, norfloxacin-promoted DNA breakage sites by the E. coli enzyme were mapped but only in one strand of a linear DNA generating a weak two-base consensus (17.Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is clear that the sequence determinants for DNA breakage have yet to be convincingly established for either topo IV or gyrase. Site-specific DNA breakage is important for the physiological functions of topo IV and gyrase and for their roles as quinolone targets. The proposed action of gyrase ahead of replication forks and topo IV behind has been invoked to explain why gyrase is the primary target of quinolones in E. coli (9.Zechiedrich E.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 9: 2859-2869Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 19.Khodursky A.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 27668-27677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (144) Google Scholar). According to the model, a replication fork is more likely to collide with a gyrase-quinolone-DNA complex converting it into a lethal lesion, possibly an irreversible double-stranded DNA break. By contrast, topo IV-quinolone-DNA complexes are envisaged to form behind the replication fork, allowing time for DNA repair by uvrD-dependent processes. The model is supported by genetic studies showing that quinolone action through gyrase is rapidly lethal to E. coli, whereas killing through topo IV (in quinolone-resistant gyrA mutants) occurs much more slowly (19.Khodursky A.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 27668-27677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, recent work is at odds with some aspects of the model (for a review see Ref. 20.Espeli O. Marians K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). First, the much greater activity of E. coli topo IV in relaxing positive over negative supercoils suggests the enzyme could act selectively to remove replication-induced positive supercoils while preserving the overall negative supercoiling of the bacterial chromosome (21.Crisona N.J. Strick T.R. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2881-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Indeed, microarray studies of E. coli DNA replication have shown that either topo IV or gyrase can support replication fork movement in vivo (22.Khodursky A.B. Peter B.J. Schmid M.B. DeRisi J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11801-11805Google Scholar). Second, for Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus), many quinolones induce cleavage complex formation much more efficiently with topo IV than gyrase in vitro (23.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, depending on the structure of the drug, either enzyme can be the primary intracellular quinolone target in S. pneumoniae (24.Pan X.-S. Ambler J. Mehtar S. Fisher L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2321-2326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 471-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Pan X.-S. Yague G. Fisher L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 3140-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These unexpected features suggest that either topo IV or gyrase can act ahead of replication forks or that the detailed replication model developed for E. coli may not hold in the pneumococcus. Quinolone targeting of topo IV and the possibility of overlapping type II topoisomerase functions highlight the need to understand the site specificity of both topo IV and gyrase. Previous studies of DNA cleavage by type IIA enzymes from Gram-positive organisms focused on gyrase purified from Micrococcus luteus but were severely limited by the inefficient capture of cleavage complexes afforded by oxolinic acid and the other quinolones then available (15.Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. Cell. 1981; 23: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this paper we have exploited recently developed and highly potent anti-pneumococcal quinolones (Fig. 1) (27.Yague G. Morris J.E. Pan X.-S. Gould K.A. Fisher L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to investigate the topological and sequence determinants of quinolone-mediated DNA breakage by topo IV and gyrase from S. pneumoniae. This study presents the first analysis of DNA scission by type IIA topoisomerases from a Gram-positive bacterium.

Fisher L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). E. coli strains XL-Blue used for DNA cloning and BL21(λ DE3)pLysS used for protein expression were obtained from Stratagene and Novagen. Plasmid pXP1 carrying a 4.3-kb HindIII fragment of the S. pneumoniae parE-parC locus cloned in pBluescript SK+/- was used in mapping topoisomerase cleavage sites and the effects of supercoiling on cleavage (28.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Plasmids pXP9, pXP10, pXP13, and pXP14 used for the expression of S. pneumoniae topoisomerase IV and gyrase subunits have been described previously (23.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coding regions of S. pneumoniae parC were amplified by PCR and cloned into plasmid pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Biosciences) for expression of GST ParC fusion proteins. Negatively supercoiled plasmid pBR322 used in enzyme assays was from Invitrogen. Linear pBR322 was generated by digestion with EcoRI. S. pneumoniae Topo IV and Gyrase—Highly active recombinant S. pneumoniae topo IV and gyrase enzymes were reconstituted from C-terminally His-tagged ParC and GyrA subunits and N-terminally His-tagged ParE and GyrB proteins (23.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to >95% homogeneity as described previously (23.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that E. coli cells were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and protein expression was carried out for 12 h at 16°C, a modification that produced higher yields of soluble protein. The purified tagged proteins were demonstrably free of host E. coli topoisomerase activity (23.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that the His tags may affect DNA cleavage specificity, non-His-tagged S. pneumoniae ParC and ParE proteins were also expressed and purified using a GST fusion approach as follows. In the case of ParC, the parC gene (28.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was amplified with proofreading Vent DNA polymerase using S. pneumoniae 7785 genomic DNA as template with C4GST (5′-GCTATGGATCCATGTCTAACATTCAAAACA) as forward primer and P7166 (5′-AGAACTTATTGAGCTCTTCACTTA) as reverse primer. C4GST carries the start codon (shown in boldface) and a BamHI restriction site (underlined); P7166 contains the stop codon (boldface) followed by an XhoI site (underlined). PCR was carried out as follows: 1 min denaturation at 94°C, 1 min annealing at 50°C, 3 min extension at 72°C; 30 cycles. The resulting 2.5-kb product was digested with BamHI and XhoI, purified from low gelling agarose, and ligated into BamHI-XhoI-cut GST expression plasmid pGEX-6P1 (that had been similarly gel-purified) prior to transformation of E. coli XL-Blue. Plasmids from drug-resistant colonies were grown, and the parC gene of one recombinant plasmid, pEL1, was sequenced in full. Plasmid pEL1 was then transformed into the expression host BL21(λDE3)pLysS. A single colony of transformed cells from an overnight plate was used to inoculate 250 ml of Luria Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37°C. When the A600 had reached 0.5, the culture was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubation continued overnight at 16°C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g and then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.5% Triton. After sonication, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for1hat4°C.The supernatant was collected and incubated with 200 μl of glutathione-Sepharose resin for 30 min. After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline, resin-bound GST-ParC fusion protein was cleaved by treatment with PreScission Protease at 4°C for 16 h with gentle agitation in Protein Cleavage Buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. Both the cleaved GST protein and the PreScission Protease remain attached to the resin, allowing the released nontagged ParC protein to be eluted from the beads. A similar approach was used to produce nontagged S. pneumoniae ParE. The parE gene (28.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from strain 7785 genomic DNA using Vent polymerase and forward primer EGST (5′-GGAGGGGATCCATGTCAAAAAAGGAAATCA; BamHI site underlined and initiation codon in boldface) and reverse primer N7044 (TATTTGGATCCTTAAAACACTGTCGC; BamHI site underlined and stop codon in boldface). PCR was performed for 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 52°C, 3 min at 72°C; 30 cycles. The 1.9-kb parE PCR product was digested with BamHI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, ligated to dephosphorylated BamHI-cut vector pGEX-6P1, and used to transform E. coli XL-Blue. One plasmid, pEL2, containing a correctly oriented parE BamHI fragment, was transformed into BL21(λDE3)pLysS. The expression and purification of GST-ParE and the recovery of ParE were performed as described for ParC. The resulting ParC and ParE proteins were recovered at >90% homogeneity. The specific activities of the non-His-tagged ParC and ParE proteins were comparable with those of the His-tagged proteins when examined in DNA supercoiling, DNA relaxation, or DNA decatenation assays (23.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in site-specific DNA cleavage assays, the His-tagged and untagged topo IV complexes showed absolutely identical behavior both in regard to DNA cleavage specificity and DNA cleavage efficiency. Thus, for topo IV (and likely for gyrase, a closely homologous protein complex), the presence or absence of C-terminal or N-terminal tags on ParC and/or ParE does not affect enzyme-DNA complex formation or DNA cleavage processes. Supercoiled and Linear pXP1 DNA—Various topological forms of plasmid pXP1 (28.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) were used as DNA cleavage substrates for topo IV and gyrase. Negatively supercoiled pXP1 DNA was recovered in quantity from cultures of pXP1-transformed E. coli XL-Blue cultures using the standard Qiagen plasmid purification kit. Linear pXP1 DNA was generated by digestion with either ScaI or XhoI, followed by precipitation with ethanol. Plasmid pXP1 (4 μg) was incubated with T. maritima reverse gyrase (40 units) at 85°C for 30 min in reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 30 μg/ml bovine plasma albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, and 1 mm ATP (total volume 250 μl). The reaction was stopped by extraction with phenol/chloroform and then chloroform. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. A 1.2% gel was run in TPE buffer (90 mm Tris phosphate, 2 mm EDTA), then soaked in TPE buffer containing 3 μg/ml chloroquine, and electrophoresed in the orthogonal direction in the same chloroquine buffer. The gel was washed extensively with TPE buffer containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide prior to photography under UV illumination using an Alpha Innotech digital camera, and quantification was by ImageQuant software. Enzyme-mediated Cleavage of Plasmid DNA—Cleavage of plasmid DNA substrates by S. pneumoniae topo IV was carried out as follows. EcoRI-cut pBR322 (0.4 μg) or pXP1 DNA (linear XhoI-cut, positively supercoiled or negatively supercoiled) (0.3 μg) was incubated with S. pneumoniae ParC (0.45 μg) and ParE (1.7 μg) at 37°C for 1 h in the presence or absence of gemifloxacin or other fluoroquinolones in topo IV reaction buffer: 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 200 mm potassium glutamate, and 50 μg/ml BSA (total volume 20 μl). Cleavage complexes were disrupted by addition of SDS to 1% followed by proteinase K at 100 μg/ml and incubation for 30 min at 42°C to digest ParC proteins covalently bound to DNA. DNA from reactions involving linear pBR322 or linear pXP1 was analyzed directly by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA products derived from reactions involving negatively or positively supercoiled pXP1 substrate were precipitated with ethanol and restricted with XhoI, prior to ethanol precipitation and gel electrophoresis. All samples were loaded on a 1% agarose gel and run at low voltage (approximately 3 V/cm) in TBE buffer. DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide, photographed, and quantitated using an Alpha Innotech digital camera as described above. Cleavage of pBR322 and the various pXP1 substrates by S. pneumoniae gyrase was carried out as for topo IV by incubation with GyrA (0.45 μg), GyrB (1.7 μg), and gemifloxacin at 25°C for 1 h in gyrase reaction buffer: 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 24 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 6.5% glycerol, 1.8 mm spermidine, and 50 μg/ml BSA (total volume 20 μl). Samples were processed and analyzed as described for cleavage with topo IV. Mapping Gemifloxacin-promoted Double-strand DNA Breaks Mediated by Topo IV and Gyrase in the parE-parC Genes of S. pneumoniae— pXP1 carries a 4.3-kb HindIII fragment of the S. pneumoniae chromosome partially encoding the parE-parC locus (28.Pan X.-S. Fisher L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and was used for low resolution mapping of cleavage sites. pXP1 linearized at the unique XhoI or ScaI sites was used as a substrate in gemifloxacin-promoted cleavage reactions with topo IV or gyrase. By comparing the sizes of cleavage fragments derived from XhoI-cut and ScaI-cut DNA, cleavage sites could be mapped in the pneumococcal DNA insert to within 50 bp. Specific PCR products (made using primers in Table I) were then employed as substrates to refine the location of sites further and to locate sites in parE and parC sequences not present in pXP1. Primer Radiolabeling Reaction—Oligonucleotide primers (20 pmol) were 5′ end-labeled by incubation with 20 pmol of [γ-33P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase for 45 min at 37°C. The kinase was inactivated at 65°C for 15 min. Labeled primers were used to generate uniquely end-labeled PCR products and cycle sequencing ladders. Sequence Analysis of Topo IV and Gyrase Cleavage Sites—High resolution mapping of cleavage sites was carried out using parE and parC PCR products (216–360-bp in size) in which the 5′ end of the top or bottom strand was radiolabeled by incorporation of one 5′ 33P-labeled primer. PCR conditions for amplification from S. pneumoniae 7785 genomic DNA were as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 35 s, and extension at 74°C for 1 min, 30 cycles. DNA fragments were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit and quantified. Labeled DNA (∼1nm) was incubated at 37°C for 1 h with either topo IV or gyrase in 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 24 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 6.5% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml BSA. To ensure similar leve"
https://openalex.org/W2024186992,"It has been previously shown that transfection activity of cationic liposome/DNA lipoplexes delivered systemically is drastically inhibited by lipoproteins (Tandia, B. M., Vandenbranden, M., Wattiez, R., Lakhdar, Z., Ruysschaert, J. M., and Elouahabi, A. (2003) Mol Ther. 8, 264–273). In this work, we have compared the binding/uptake and transfection activities of DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride) and diC14-amidine (3-tetradecylamino-N-tert-butyl-N′-tetra-decylpropionamidine)-containing lipoplexes in the presence or absence of purified low density lipoproteins and high density lipoprotein. Binding/uptake of both lipoplexes by the mouse lung endothelial cell line was inhibited to a similar extent in the presence of lipoproteins. In contrast, transfection activity of diC14-amidine-containing lipoplexes was almost completely inhibited (approximately by 95%), whereas ∼40% transfection activity of DOTAP-containing lipoplexes was preserved in the presence of lipoproteins. Interestingly, the ability of lipoproteins to inhibit the transfection efficiency of lipoplexes was well correlated with their ability to undergo lipid mixing with the cationic lipid bilayer as revealed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. Incubation of lipoplexes with increased doses of lipoproteins resulted in enhanced lipid mixing and reduced transfection activity of the lipoplexes in mouse lung endothelial cells. The role of lipid mixing in transfection was further demonstrated using lipid-mixing inhibitor, lyso-phosphatidylcholine, or activator (dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine). Incorporation of Lyso-PC into diC14-amidine-containing lipoplexes completely abolished their capacity to undergo lipid mixing with lipoproteins and allowed them to reach a high transfection efficiency in the presence of lipoproteins. On the other hand, the incorporation of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine into DOTAP/DNA lipoplex activated lipid mixing with the lipoproteins and was shown to be detrimental toward the transfection activity of these lipoplexes. Taken together, these results indicate that fusion of lipoplexes with lipoproteins is a limiting factor for in vivo transfection. It has been previously shown that transfection activity of cationic liposome/DNA lipoplexes delivered systemically is drastically inhibited by lipoproteins (Tandia, B.

Taken together, these results indicate that fusion of lipoplexes with lipoproteins is a limiting factor for in vivo transfection. Cationic lipids have been used for in vivo gene delivery into animal models via several routes of administration including intravenous (1.Templeton N.S. Lasic D.D. Frederik P.M. Strey H.H.

Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The intravenous route of administration is attractive, because it potentially allows the transport of the vector to various tissues in the body. However, it involves the interaction of the lipoplexes with the blood components before they reach the target cells. Intravenously injected cationic lipid/DNA lipoplexes accumulate rapidly (within 5–10 min) in major organs including lung, liver, and spleen (6.Mahato R.I. Anwer K. Tagliaferri F. Meaney C. Leonard P.

Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells covering the blood vessels of these organs are the main target cells for the lipoplexes (8.McLean J.W.

Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1753-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Parts of the lung-associated lipoplexes do not enter the cells and presumably accumulate in the lumen of small blood vessels of this organ. 1–2 h after injection, these lung-associated lipoplexes redistribute partially into the liver and the spleen (6.Mahato R.I. Anwer K. Tagliaferri F. Meaney C. Leonard P. Wadhwa M.S. Logan M. French M. Rolland A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 14: 2083-2099Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7.Liu F. Qi H. Huang L. Liu D. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This particular biodistribution has been attributed to interactions between lipoplexes and plasma components resulting in rapid aggregation of lipoplexes (11.Tandia B.M. Vandenbranden M. Wattiez R. Lakhdar Z. Ruysschaert J.M. Elouahabi A. Mol Ther. 2003; 8: 264-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12.Li S. Tseng W.C. Stolz D.B. Wu S.P. Watkins S.C. Huang L. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Aggregated lipoplexes are retained in the small blood vessels of the lung in a first step and are subsequently slowly removed by the blood flow. Such interactions between lipoplexes and plasma are still poorly characterized at the molecular level. Generally, the lung shows the highest transfection efficiency when lipoplexes are administered via the intravenous route. However, the choice of the helper lipid is crucial in determining the final transfection efficiency. Several studies have shown that the use of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) 1The abbreviations used are: DOPE, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Lyso-PC, lyso-phosphatidylcholine; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay; MLE, mouse lung endothelial cell line; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Luc, luciferase; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride.1The abbreviations used are: DOPE, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Lyso-PC, lyso-phosphatidylcholine; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay; MLE, mouse lung endothelial cell line; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Luc, luciferase; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride. as helper lipid resulted in a decrease of the intravenous transfection efficiency of the lipoplexes in several organs (2.Li S. Huang L. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 12.Li S. Tseng W.C. Stolz D.B. Wu S.P. Watkins S.C. Huang L.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Why DOPE causes a decrease in the in vivo transfection efficiency, whereas it generally enhances this efficiency in vitro, is still an open question. It has been suggested that interaction of the lipoplexes with plasma components may be modulated by the helper lipid and would explain differences in transfection efficiency (12.Li S. Tseng W.C. Stolz D.B. Wu S.P. Watkins S.C. Huang L. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In an effort to characterize these interactions, we have previously isolated and identified the plasma proteins and lipoproteins that bind to diC14-amidine (3-tetrade-cylamino-N-tert-butyl-N′-tetradecylpropionamidine)/DNA lipoplexes. Lipoprotein particles including low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) are among the plasma components that bind to the lipoplexes. Such a binding was shown to inhibit the transfection efficiency in cultured cells (11.Tandia B.M. Vandenbranden M. Wattiez R. Lakhdar Z. Ruysschaert J.M. Elouahabi A. Mol Ther. 2003; 8: 264-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the reason behind this strong inhibitory effect remains unclear. In this study, we compared the influence of the lipoprotein particles HDL and LDL on the uptake and transfection efficiencies of DOTAP/DNA and diC14-amidine/DNA in cultured endothelial cells. Although binding/uptake by the cells of both lipoplexes was inhibited to the same extent, the transfection efficiency was affected differently depending on the cationic lipid used. This suggested that other factors were involved. Because lipoplexes and plasma lipoproteins interact together, we wondered whether such an interaction was limited to a contact between both particles or whether it involved additional reorganization such as lipid mixing. We demonstrated that efficient lipid mixing occurred between lipoproteins and diC14-amidine/DNA but not DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes. Comparison with transfection data shows a good inverse correlation between lipid mixing and transfection, suggesting that this process is a limiting step for cationic lipid-mediated intravenous gene transfer and expression. Reagents—diC14-Amidine was synthetized as described previously (16.Ruysschaert J.M. Elouahabi A. Willeaume V. Huez G. Fuks R. Vandenbranden M. Di Stefano P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1622-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DOTAP and DOPE were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Albaster, AL). Rh-PE (N-(lissamine rhodamine B-sulfonyl)phosphatidylethanolamine) and NBD-PE (N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine triethylammonium salt) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Trypsin was from Sigma. Human plasma was prepared from blood collected from healthy volunteers. 10 ml of fresh blood were mixed with 5 μl of heparin (5000 IU/ml) immediately after collection and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Purification and Labeling with 35S of Plasmid DNA—pCMV-luc plasmid (∼5.4 kb) was constructed by ligating an EcoRI-NheI fragment (corresponding to an improved sequence of the luciferase gene) of the pSP-luc+ plasmid (Promega Benelux) into the pCI expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which was cut with EcoRI and NheI. The resulting plasmid contained the luciferase gene under the control of the immediate early CMV promoter-enhancer and was purified using a Qiagen kit (Giga plasmid preparation) according to the manufacturer's instructions and resuspended in sterile water. The purified plasmid was further treated with a polymyxin resin (Affi-Prep™, Bio-Rad) to remove endotoxins. 200 μl of the Affi-Prep resin was first rendered pyrogen-free by treatment with 600 μl of 0.5 n NaOH and then washed twice with 1.5 ml of pyrogen-free water. The resin then was pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 400 μl of the DNA solution and mixed overnight in a rotary mixer at 4 °C. The DNA was separated from the resin by centrifugation. Plasmid DNA was labeled with 35S using a modified nick-translation technique as described previously (11.Tandia B.M. Vandenbranden M. Wattiez R. Lakhdar Z. Ruysschaert J.M. Elouahabi A. Mol Ther. 2003; 8: 264-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Isolation of Plasma Lipoproteins and Their Treatment with Trypsin—Lipoproteins were isolated from plasma by potassium bromide density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (17.Chapman M.J. Goldstein S. Lagrange D. Laplaud P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 339-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A discontinuous potassium bromide density gradient was prepared in ultracentrifugation tubes using potassium bromide solutions as follows (from bottom to top): 2 ml of d = 1.24 g/ml; 6 ml of d = 1.21 g/ml containing plasma; 6 ml of d = 1.125 g/ml; 6 ml of d = 1.063 g/ml; 2 ml of d = 1.019 g/ml; 2 ml of d = 1.006 g/ml; and 2 ml of pure water. Samples then were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Three fractions corresponding to the very low density lipoproteins (d = 1.013 g/ml), LDL (d = 1.013–1.046 g/ml), and HDL (d = 1.046–1.130 g/ml) were sampled. Lipoproteins were purified from potassium bromide using gel filtration chromatography on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Total protein, cholesterol, and phospholipid contents were determined in each sample using commercially available BCA (Pierce), CHOL (Roche Applied Science), and PL (Roche Applied Science) assay kits, respectively. For trypsinization, the lipoproteins were incubated with trypsin at a trypsin/lipoprotein ratio of 1:4 (w:w). The mixture then was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the tubes on ice and by the addition of the trypsin inhibitor Nα-tosyl-l -lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride (Sigma). The samples then were ultracentrifuged at 35,000 rpm (in a SW 60 Beckmann rotor) at 4 °C for 15 min and then washed twice with Hepes-buffered saline (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3). Preparation of Liposomes and Liposome/DNA Complexes—diC14-Amidine or DOTAP liposomes were prepared as described previously (3.Elouahabi A. Flamand V. Ozkan S. Paulart F. Vandenbranden M. Goldman M. Ruysschaert J.M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rh-PE/NBD-PE-labeled diC14-amidine or DOTAP liposomes were prepared as described (3.Elouahabi A. Flamand V. Ozkan S. Paulart F. Vandenbranden M. Goldman M. Ruysschaert J.M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the exception that 1.5% (molar) Rh-PE and 1.5% (molar) NBD-PE were added to the lipid solution in chloroform before film formation. The liposome suspensions were stored at 4 °C and heated at 60 °C for 15 min with intermittent brief vortexing before use. For lipoplex preparation, all of the buffers were autoclave-sterilized and warmed at 37 °C immediately before use. The pCMV-luc plasmid DNA was diluted in 150 mm NaCl or 5% dextrose (for diC14-amidine and DOTAP lipoplexes, respectively) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The diC14-amidine or DOTAP liposomes were diluted in Hepes-buffered saline and Hepes-buffered dextrose (20 mm Hepes, 5% dextrose, pH 7.3), respectively, to a concentration of 4 mg/ml in a 4-ml polystyrene tube (Falcon), and protamine sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. One volume of the DNA solution was added to an equal volume of the liposome-protamine mixture while gently shaking the tube (we generally prepare 100–400 μl of lipoplexes in a tube). The liposome/protamine/DNA mixture was allowed to stand for 15 min at room temperature. Under these conditions, the lipoplexes have a (+/–) charge ratio of 5:1 and the protamine/DNA weight ratio is 0.6:1. The preparation was stable for several hours. In Vivo Transfection and Luciferase Expression Analysis—Mice were injected through the lateral tail vein with 200 μl of the lipoplex solution at the indicated concentrations. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation 24 h after injection, and the organs were removed and tissue extracts were prepared as described previously (3.Elouahabi A. Flamand V. Ozkan S. Paulart F. Vandenbranden M. Goldman M. Ruysschaert J.M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity (expressed as relative light units) was measured using 20 μl of cell lysate and 100 μl of the luciferase assay reagent (Promega) by integrating light emission over 10 s in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). In Vitro Transfection and Effect of Plasma Components on the Transfection Efficiency—To investigate the effect of plasma components on transfection, the mouse lung endothelial cell line (MLE) was chosen because lung endothelial cells are the main transfected cells after intravenous injection of cationic lipid/DNA complexes. This cell line was a gift from Dr. Nicolson (Institute for Molecular Medicine, Huntington Beach, CA) and was previously confirmed as endothelial cells (18.Belloni P.N. Carney D.H. Nicoloson G.L. Microvasc. Res. 1992; 43: 20-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19.Wakabayashi H. Cavanaugh P.G. Nicoloson G.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4458-4464PubMed Google Scholar). MLE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (complete medium) (Invitrogen). For transfection, cells were seeded in the 24-well culture plates at 7 × 104 cells/well and transfected 24 h later. Transfection was carried out in quadruplicate as follows. 100 μl of lipoplexes (prepared as described above) were diluted in 800 μl of Hepes-buffered saline (or Hepes-buffered dextrose for DOTAP-containing lipoplexes), and aliquots of 20 μl of the diluted lipoplex (containing 0.125 μg of DNA) were mixed with equal volumes of buffer or purified lipoprotein particles HDL and LDL at the indicated lipoprotein/lipoplex ratio (w:w). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and diluted with 1 ml of DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes (transfection medium). 200 μl (corresponding to 0.125 μg of DNA) were incubated in each well. After 2 h, the transfection medium was replaced with the complete medium and the cells were further incubated. 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The cells were scraped with disposable scrapers, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 2 min to remove residual cell fragments. Luciferase activity was measured as described above. Cell Uptake of Lipoplexes: Role of Lipoprotein Particles LDL and HDL—Cells were plated and transfected as described with some modifications. DNA was mixed with trace amounts of [35S]DNA before use to prepare the lipoplexes. An aliquot of the lipoplexes was kept at 4 °C to quantify the total radioactivity. The remaining lipoplexes were incubated with purified lipoproteins particles (using a lipoprotein/lipoplex ratio of 9:1 (w:w)) and incubated with MLE cells in quadruplicate for 2 h. Lipoplexes incubated with the buffer were used as controls. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with DMEM and twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% SDS. Cell lysates then were mixed with 5 ml of Ecolite scintillation liquid (ICN), and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. The percentage of associated material was calculated after subtracting background radioactivity and dividing the radioactivity associated with the cells by the total radioactivity added to the well. Fusion Assay—Fusion between lipoplexes and lipoproteins was monitored using fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay (FRET) as described previously (20.Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Cationic liposomes containing NBD-PE and Rh-PE at 1.5% (molar) each were used to prepare lipoplexes as described above. Unless otherwise indicated, 162 μg of the lipoproteins (LDL or HDL) were added to lipoplexes (18 μg of cationic lipid) (resulting in a lipoprotein/cationic lipid weight ratio of 9:1) and loaded in a quartz fluorescence cell thermostatized at 37 °C. The fluorescence was monitored using an SLM-8000 spectrofluometer with excitation and emission slits of 4 nm. Generally, samples were excited at 470 nm and emission of both probes was recorded by scanning fluorescence between 500 and 650 nm. The initial fluorescence of the labeled lipoplex suspension was recorded as 0% fluorescence, and the 100% fluorescence was determined after adding Triton X-100 at 1% (v/v) final concentration. Percentage of fusion was estimated from the fluorescence of NBD as shown in Equation 1, %F=(FNBD−F0)/(F100−F0) where F0 is the maximum fluorescence of NBD (contained in the lipoplexes) before the addition of lipoproteins, FNBD is the maximum fluorescence of NBD (contained in the lipoplexes) in the presence of lipoproteins, and F100 is the maximum fluorescence of NBD after the addition of Triton X-100. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Measurements—DSC measurements were performed on a DSC-7 differential scanning calorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Instruments) using twin aluminum pans. The samples were scanned from 5 to 45 °C at 2 °C/min. All of the samples were degassed before measurements. The experimental data were processed using Origin™ Software from MicroCal. Plasma Lipoprotein Particles, LDL and HDL, Inhibit the in Vivo Transfection Efficiency of Lipoplexes—Previous reports have shown that lipoproteins, including LDL and HDL, inhibit the in vitro transfection efficiency of diC14-amidine/DNA lipoplexes in MLE (11.Tandia B.M. Vandenbranden M. Wattiez R. Lakhdar Z. Ruysschaert J.M. Elouahabi A. Mol Ther. 2003; 8: 264-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of lipoproteins in the in vivo transfection process, diC14-amidine/pCMV-Luc lipoplexes were prepared, incubated with purified LDL or HDL, and injected intravenously into mice. Luciferase activity was measured in lung homogenates 24 h after injection. Lipoplexes preincubated with lipoproteins showed a diminished transfection efficiency in the lung as compared with controls (Fig. 1). This result confirms the role of lipoprotein particles in limiting the intravenous transfection efficiency using lipoplexes. Comparison of Lipoprotein-mediated Inhibition of Binding/Uptake and Transfection Efficiencies Associated to Cationic Lipids diC14-Amidine and DOTAP—Inhibition of transfection efficiency by lipoproteins may be interpreted in terms of an inhibition of binding/uptake of lipoplexes. To investigate this possibility, diC14-amidine/DNA and DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes were preincubated with LDL or HDL and transfection efficiency in MLE cells was compared with that of control lipoplexes. In parallel, lipoplexes containing a trace amount of radioactive DNA were preincubated with LDL or HDL and incubated with the cells and cell-associated radioactivity was measured. LDL and HDL inhibited drastically the binding/uptake by the cells of both diC14-amidine/DNA and DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes (Fig. 2). However, the transfection was affected differently depending on the cationic lipid used. 95% transfection efficiency of diC14-amidine-containing lipoplexes was inhibited in the presence of the lipoproteins, whereas that of DOTAP-containing lipoplex was inhibited only by ∼60%. This suggests that the decrease of transfection efficiency cannot be interpreted in terms of binding/uptake inhibition only. Clearly, other factors were involved. Lipoplex-Plasma Lipoprotein Interaction Leads to Mixing of Lipids of Both Components—Lipoplexes and plasma lipoproteins interact together (11.Tandia B.M. Vandenbranden M. Wattiez R. Lakhdar Z. Ruysschaert J.M. Elouahabi A. Mol Ther. 2003; 8: 264-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because lipoproteins and lipoplexes both contain a lipid component, we wondered whether such an interaction was limited to a contact between both particles or involved a reorganization such as lipid mixing. To verify this hypothesis, we monitored lipid mixing between lipoplexes and lipoproteins by FRET. Two fluorescent probes, NBD-PE (the donor of energy) and Rh-PE (the acceptor of energy), were inserted into the bilayer of lipoplexes at 1.5% (molar) probe concentration. Under these conditions, the fluorescence of the donor was transferred to the acceptor. Lipoplexes were prepared and then incubated with lipoproteins from human plasma, and the fluorescence of the probes was measured in a fluorimeter as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Excitation at 470 nm (maximum excitation of the donor fluorophore NBD-PE) of control diC14-amidine or DOTAP-containing lipoplexes doubly labeled with NBD-PE and Rh-PE resulted in a weak fluorescence of NBD-PE (at 525 nm), whereas Rh-PE fluorescence was quite intense (at 585 nm) (Fig. 3A). This means that, in the labeled diC14-amidine/DNA and DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes, NBD-PE and Rh-PE probes are close enough to allow a direct transfer of the fluorescence energy from the donor to the acceptor. After incubation of the labeled diC14-amidine/DNA lipoplexes with the lipoprotein HDL or LDL, fluorescence of NBD-PE strongly increased, whereas that of Rh-PE decreased (Fig. 3A). This demonstrates the mixing of lipids from the lipoprotein particles and the diC14-amidine bilayer. Interestingly, the fluorescence of NBD-PE or Rh-PE was not modified after incubation of labeled DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes with the lipoproteins (Fig. 3B). This finding suggested that interactions between DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes and lipoproteins did not result in lipid mixing. To rule out a direct influence of the lipoproteins on the fluorescence of the probes, lipoplexes labeled with only NBD-PE or Rh-PE were incubated with the lipoproteins HDL or LDL. No modification of the excitation or emission spectra of both probes could be detected (data not shown). For both lipoprotein types, the lipid-mixing process was slow (Fig. 4) compared with what has been observed in other lipid-mixing processes (21.Martin I. Schaal H. Scheid A. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 298-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid mixing of different liposome populations usually takes place within a few minutes, whereas that observed in this study took place ∼40 min to reach a plateau. A possible explanation could be that fusion between lipoproteins and lipoplexes is slowed down by the presence of the apoproteins, which stabilize the particles. To test this hypothesis, the LDL and HDL particles were first trypsinized to remove the accessible parts of the apoproteins and incubated with the NBD-PE/Rh-PE doubly labeled diC14-amidine/DNA lipoplexes. For trypsinized LDL (Fig. 4A) and HDL (Fig. 4B), maximum lipid mixing was reached in <5 min. This result clearly shows that the apoproteins slow down the fusion process presumably by stabilizing the lipoprotein particles. Correlation between the Ability of Lipoproteins to Fuse with the Lipoplexes and to Inhibit Their Transfection Activity—To study a possible correlation between the ability of the lipoproteins to fuse with lipoplexes and their ability to inhibit the transfection efficiency, two sets of experiments were carried out in parallel. In one set, diC14-amidine/pCMV-luc or DOTAP/pCMV-luc lipoplexes were doubly labeled with NBD-PE and Rh-PE and incubated with the lipoproteins LDL or HDL as described above. Percentages of lipid mixing were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In parallel, unlabeled lipoplexes were incubated with lipoproteins and used to transfect cultured MLE cells. After 24 h, the cells were lysed and the luciferase activity was detected in cell lysates. Lipid mixing between diC14-amidine/DNA lipoplex and HDL or LDL reached ∼25 and 50%, respectively (Fig. 5A). In contrast, DOTAP/DNA lipoplex showed no significant fusion with either lipoprotein (Fig. 5A). On the o"

Despite our wealth of knowledge on the genes that are targeted by p53 in growth arrest and apoptosis, relatively little is known about the promoter specificity triggered by p53 in these processes. Here we show that interaction with c-Abl stabilized p53 tetrameric conformation, and as a consequence c-Abl stimulated p53 DNA binding only when all quarter binding sites (a perfect binding sequence) on p53-responsive promoters were present. This result suggests that in response to DNA damage, c-Abl binding may specifically stimulate p53 DNA binding on the promoters with perfect binding sequences. A sequence comparison of several known p53-responsive elements illustrates the presence of the perfect binding sequences on the p21 but not the Bax promoter. Significantly, we show that c-Abl indeed enhanced p53 DNA binding and transcription from p21 but not Bax. These results suggest that the promoter specificity plays an important role in selective activation of p53 DNA binding by c-Abl. The implications of this with relation to selective activation of p53 target genes involved in either growth arrest or apoptosis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2048109080,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ϵ (C/EBPϵ) is a neutrophil-specific transcription factor whose activity is controlled by juxtaposed activating and regulatory domains. We previously determined that the function of the major regulatory domain (RD1) in C/EBPϵ was dependent on the integrity of a five-amino acid motif that was identical to the recognition site for members of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of ubiquitin-related proteins. We show here that the SUMO attachment site (the regulatory domain motif) is necessary and sufficient both for the intrinsic inhibitory function of RD1 and for coactivation by PIASxα and PIASxβ, two members of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family of SUMO E3 ligases. PIASxβ was a more potent coactivator than PIASxα of both full-length C/EBPϵ and fusion proteins containing the N-terminal portion of C/EBPϵ, whereas PIASxα was more active on fusion proteins containing a heterologous activation domain. Two modes of coactivation were observed, one that was dependent on the integrity of the RING finger (RF) domain and was shared by both PIASxα and PIASxβ and a second mode that was independent of the RF and was only observed with PIASxβ. Sumoylation of C/EBPϵ was enhanced by coexpression of PIASxα, suggesting that this modification is associated with the enhanced activity of the target protein. These results suggest that a complex interplay of accessory factors, including SUMO and PIAS proteins, modulates the activity of C/EBPϵ."

Thyroid hormone is essential for the normal growth and development of vertebrates.

They also share an N-terminal membrane-spanning region and a central core of 14–16 residues surrounding the SeC, but little else is known about the polypeptide. Gel filtration and density gradient centrifugation of detergent-soluble enzyme activity and/or affinity radiolabeled D1 showed that catalytic activity has an Mr of ∼50,000 and that the ∼27-kDa D1 polypeptide co-migrated with a complex, suggesting that D1 is a dimer of ∼27-kDa subunits (9Leonard J.L.

The physiochemical properties of the other selenodeiodinase family members remain to be determined, although a recent report using transiently expressed, epitope-tagged D2 and D3 suggested that these family members also formed dimers, albeit at modest levels (12Curcio-Morelli C.

Direct analysis of D1 biosynthesis confirmed that the active enzyme was a homodimer formed by the post-translational assembly of two p27 subunits (9Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whether each subunit was catalytically functional or required post-translational assembly to become catalytically active was resolved by the finding that D1 dimers with only one functional subunit had ∼50% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme (9Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Curcio-Morelli C. Gereben B. Zavacki A.M. Kim B.W. Huang S. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Importantly, these hybrid holoenzymes had a molecular mass of 54 kDa and an S20,w of ∼3.5 S, identical to that of the native D1 holoenzyme (9Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The ability of each D1 subunit to function as an independent catalytic center was recently confirmed by Curcio-Morelli et al. (12Curcio-Morelli C. Gereben B. Zavacki A.M. Kim B.W. Huang S. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of the membrane anchor located between residues 9 and 37 of p27 resulted in the formation of catalytically active D1 heterodimers composed of a full-length, membrane-bound subunit and the N-terminal truncated partner lacking a transmembrane domain (9Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), indicating that insertion of both D1 subunits into the membrane was not required. Whether holoenzyme assembly required covalent or noncovalent protein-protein interactions was recently examined using transient co-expression of epitope-tagged p27 constructs (12Curcio-Morelli C. Gereben B. Zavacki A.M. Kim B.W. Huang S. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A minor role for intermolecular disulfide bridging between p27 partners (ranging from 1 to 5% of the total) was recently proposed based on banding pattern(s) of epitope-tagged p27 found after SDS-PAGE analysis. Presumably because of sequence diversity among deiodinase family members, dimer complexes formed between different family members were not observed after SDS-PAGE analysis, suggesting that only like family members could associate (12Curcio-Morelli C. Gereben B. Zavacki A.M. Kim B.W. Huang S. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we mapped the dimerization domain(s) required for deiodinase assembly by exploiting the ability of the native p27 present in LLC-PK1 cells to form dimers with truncation fragments of the immunologically unique, inert rat p27 (M4). We also determined the role of dimerization in the assembly of a catalytically active SeD2 enzyme using C6 cells that constitutively express the 30-kDa SeD2 subunit. The results of our studies show that the highly conserved sequence present in all deiodinase family members from frogs to humans, -DFL-YI-EAH-DGW-, serves as the dimerization domain for holoenzyme assembly. For the D1 family member, catalytic activity is preserved when only one subunit is catalytically competent, whereas the D2 isoform required two fully functional subunits to be catalytically active.

A common upstream primer corresponding to nucleotides 7–19 of G21 cDNA and a Kozak consensus initiation site was used. PCR was done using Vent® DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for a total of 25 cycles according to the following temperature profile: 95 °C, 1.0 min; 50 °C, 1.0 min; 72 °C, 2.0 min, with a final 10-min extended incubation at 72 °C. PCR products were digested with KpnI, gel-isolated on 1.2% low melt agarose gels, and ligated into the KpnI-SmaI sites of pcDNA3 (N-terminal deletions) or into KpnI-HindIII sites of pcDNA3 (C-terminal deletions). All deletion/truncation mutants were confirmed by DNA cycle sequencing. Complementary synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 445–496 of G21 cDNA were used to synthesize the D1 dimerization domain-GFP fusion protein (DDDGFP). The 72-mer sense oligonucleotide (5′-TAGACCACCATGGTCGCTGACTTCCTCATCATTTACATTGAAGAAGCTCACGCCACAGATGGATGGGCTCTG-3′) and its 72-mer complementary oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCAGAGCCCATCCATCTGTGGCGTGAGCTTCTTCAATGTAAATGATGAGGAAGTCAGCGACCATGGTGGT-3′) were annealed, yielding a double-stranded 72-bp fragment with an N-terminal Met in a Kozak consensus start site, an NheI-compatible 5′ overhang, and a BglII-compatible 3′-overhang. The annealed DDD encoding sequence was appended to the N terminus of GFP by cloning into the NheI BglII sites of pEGFP-N1, generating pDDDGFP. Correct insertion was confirmed by DNA cycle sequencing.

Stable transfectants were selected at 1 mg/ml G418, and antibiotic-resistant cells were expanded without clonal isolation. Cells constitutively expressing M4 (inactivated D1 subunit), M4 deletion and M4 truncation mutants, and DDDGFP were grown in 800 μg/ml G418 to maintain expression of the exogenous gene product. SeD2-expressing C6 cells were grown to 60% confluence in growth medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 and transfected with 10 μg of either pEGFP (GFP control) or pcDNA3-M4 (D1 subunit) or 10 μg of pDDDGFP fusion construct using cationic liposomes (DOTAP®; Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells expressing the GFP fusion proteins were amplified by selection with 1.5 mg/ml G418. Greater than 95% of the hyperresistant G418-selected SeD2 cells expressed GFP as judged by fluorescence microscopy. DNA Sequencing—Double-stranded DNA sequencing was done by the dideoxynucleotide method of Sanger et al. (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All sequence information was confirmed by sequencing both strands. Antibody Depletion of Deiodinase Dimers—Anti-epitope antibodies directed against the C terminus of rat p27 or rat SeD2 were used for pull-down assays. Incubations were done for 90 min at 4 °C in a total volume of 100 μl that contained 50–100 units of tDOC-solubilized enzyme (D1 or D2) prepared from purified membranes (9Leonard J.L. Visser T.J.

Where indicated, excess C-terminal p27 peptide (10 μg/ml, final concentration) was added to block antibody-binding sites prior to the pull-down assay. Immune complexes were removed by centrifugation, and the deiodinase activity remaining in the clarified supernatant was determined as described below. Expression levels of the exogenous M4 deletion and truncation constructs in LLC-PK1 cells were determined by a competitive binding assay as described previously (9Leonard J.L. Visser T.J.

The minimum detection limit of M4 and its derivatives is ∼3 fmol/assay tube (81 pg of p27/tube), and the maximum binding capacity of the anti-rat p27 antiserum is 22 nmol of M4/ml of antiserum (∼600 ng of p27/μl) as determined by Scatchard analysis of the binding data. SeD2-specific immune complexes were removed by centrifugation and released from the beads by heating at 70 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies. Specific immune complexes were identified with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, anti-mouse IgG (rabbit; Molecular Probes) and visualized by chemiluminescence. Photomicroscopy—Cells expressing the DDDGFP fusion protein were seeded onto poly-d-lysine (10 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm) and grown to ∼80% confluence. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline, and the excess cross-linker was quenched with 100 mm glycine. The distribution of GFP fusion protein in LLC-PK1 and SeD2 cells was then determined by fluorescence microscopy. Digital images were captured using a Spot CCD camera (Meyer Instruments, Inc., Houston, TX) and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Photomicrographs shown are representative of 20–30 independent fields. Analytical Procedures—D1 activity was determined in cell lysates by measuring the release of radioiodide from 10 μm [125I]rT3 (100 cpm/pmol) at 20 mm dithiothreitol (unless otherwise indicated) in a total volume of 100 μl. D1 reactions were done, in triplicate, in universal deiodinase buffer (100 mm boric acid, 100 mm HEPES, 100 mm glycine) (pH 5.5), 1 mm EDTA, with 10–25 μg of cell protein and incubated at 37 °C for 10–30 min. Product formation was measured as described previously (13Leonard J.L. Rosenberg I.N. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1376-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and the data are expressed as units/mg protein where 1 unit equals 1 pmol of I– released per min for D1 and 1 fmol of I– released per min for D2. D2 activity was determined at substrate concentrations of 2 nm [125I]rT3 (500 cpm/fmol), 20 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of 1 mm 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil as described previously (17Visser T.J.

Commun. 1988; 151: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least three times. Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test. The ability of an overexpressed catalytically inert D1 subunit to partner with >95% of the native p27 subunit(s) in LLC-PK1 cells (9Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) allowed us to use changes in catalytic activity as a measure of protein-protein interaction(s). Preliminary attempts to recover deiodinating activity from immune precipitated p27wt:M4 heterodimers were unsuccessful due, in large part, to the >80% reduction in enzyme activity due to the nonspecific binding of the iodothyronine substrate to the immunoaffinity beads (data not shown). Since these nonspecific interactions are partially reversed under acidic conditions, we re-evaluated the pH dependence of the D1 reaction in an attempt to find conditions that would allow detection of immune precipitated enzyme. Shown in Fig. 1 is the pH profile of D1 activity present in detergent-solubilized COS7 cell lysates expressing a catalytically active D1 (G21 (5Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar)). Contrary to traditional D1 assay conditions, deiodination showed a maximum at pH ∼5.5, identical to that of the pKa of the reactive SeC nucleophile and ∼2 orders of magnitude lower than that used to measure D1 activity (19Leonard J.L. Rosenberg I.N. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Visser T.J. Does-Tobe I. Docter R. Hennemann G. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Auf Dem Brinke D. Hesch R.D. Kohrle J. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At optimal pH, the catalytic potential of D1 was 2–3-fold greater than that measured at pH 7.0. All subsequent D1 assays were done at pH 5.5. To confirm immune precipitation, D1 heterodimers with catalytic activity, cell membranes from LLC-PK1 cells constitutively expressing M4 or vector controls were solubilized with 5 mm tDOC, and 2.5 mg of solubilized protein was incubated with 10 μg of anti-rat p27 IgG (antibody 3050; the IgG does not recognize the endogenous LLC-PK1 p27). Immune complexes were collected with MagPrep® Protein A beads, washed free of unbound proteins, and then resuspended in 100 μl of Universal Deiodinase Buffer. As shown in Table II, the parent cell lysates with M4:p27wt dimers had ∼50% of the activity of the control cells (9Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and more than 95% of the activity lost by immune depletion was recovered in the immune pellets. These data confirm the nearly complete formation of D1 heterodimers composed of the inert M4 subunit coupled to the catalytically active wild-type p27 donated by the LLC-PK1 cell.Table IID1 activity in immune precipitates from LLC-PK1 cells expressing M4 or vector controlsEnzyme sourceD1 dimerD1 activityTotal unitsControl tDOC extractwt:wt100 ± 10 (n = 3)M4-tDOC extractM4:p27wt48 ± 4 (n = 3)Unbound D1wtwt:wt96 ± 10 (n = 3)Unbound M4-D1M4-p27wt2 ± 4 (n = 3)Immobilized control D1wt:wt1 ± 4 (n = 3)Immobilized M4-D1M4:p27wt45 ± 6 (n = 3) Open table in a new tab D1 Dimerization Domain Mapping by Deletion and Truncation Mutants of M4 Expressed in LLC-PK1 Cells—To define the D1 dimerization domain, we prepared a series of N-terminal deletion (X series) and C-terminal truncation (C series) mutations of M4. X and C series mutants were transfected into LLC-PK1 cells, and constitutively expressing cell lines were isolated by G418 selection. All X-series M4 mutants had a Kozak consensus translation initiation site to ensure adequate expression, and all C-series mutants had the 8-amino acid epitope recognized by the anti-rat p27 IgG at the C terminus. Expression levels of the exogenous X and C series protein(s) in the G418-selected LLC-PK1 cells were determined by competitive displacement analysis and revealed that the cell content of the different truncated/deleted M4s varied from 0.9 ± 0.1 to 1.8 ± 0.3 pmol/mg cell protein, yielding molar ratios of X or C series M4 to p27wt that ranged from ∼5 (X133, C230) to 10 (X42, C150), values similar to those reported previously (9Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cell membranes were then prepared for each X and C series M4 mutant by Percoll gradient centrifugation, and the enzyme activity in detergent extracts of the membrane fractions was measured after immune depletion with anti-rat p27 antisera with or without excess blocking peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As illustrated in Fig. 2A, >95% of the D1 activity in cells expressing the X series of M4 deletion mutants (X19 to X133) was specifically immune-depleted from detergent extracts, just as found previously with the full-length M4 (9Leonard J.L. Visser T.J. Leonard D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2600-2607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The percentages of D1 heterodimer formation, calculated from the difference in the quantity of residual D1 activity in immune depleted extracts measured in the absence and presence of blocking peptide, are summarized in Fig. 2B. More than half of the p27 could be deleted from the N terminus (up to residue 133, including the transmembrane anchor, the substrate specificity site, and the catalytic center) without altering the binding of the truncated M4 to p27wt. These data indicate that the dimerization domain resides in the C-terminal 120 residues of p27. Direct analysis of progressive truncation mutants from the C terminus of p27 revealed that at least 86 residues could be removed from the C terminus of M4 without altering the interaction between the truncated M4 and p27wt (Fig. 2B). However, loss of residues located between positions 150 and 170 completely eliminated the ability of the truncated M4 mutant to interact with p27wt. These data indicate that the D1 dimerization domain resides in the C terminus of p27 between residues 150 and 170, a region that contains the most highly conserved element of the deiodinase family from frogs to humans. Kinetic Analysis of Engineered D1 Heterodimers Lacking a Transmembrane Anchor (X42), a Substrate Specificity Domain (X72), or One Catalytic Center (X133)—Shown in Fig. 3 are representative initial velocity reaction kinetics for the wild-type D1wt, the full-length M4:p27wt, and the X42:p27wt dimers. All hybrid D1 heterodimers showed ping-pong reaction kinetics. Secondary replots yielded the limiting Km and Vmax values (Table III) and revealed that the loss of the N-terminal membrane anchor (X42), the iodothyronine specificity site (X101), and even the catalytic center (X133) resulted in a 2.5-fold decrease in the limiting Km for the iodothyronine and a 75% fall in the molar activity compared with the native enzyme. Unexpectedly, loss of the membrane anchor increased the reduced thiol cofactor requirement ∼4-fold (Table III). These data show that kinetic properties of the D1 reaction are intrinsic to each subunit.Table IIILimiting kinetic constants for wild type D1, M4-p27wt, and X42, X101, and X133 truncation mutantsEnzyme sourceLimiting KmMolar activityrT3Dithiothreitolμmmmmol product·min-1·mol D"
https://openalex.org/W2087639494,"In the bacteriophage T4 DNA replication system, T4 RNase H removes the RNA primers and some adjacent DNA before the lagging strand fragments are ligated. This 5′-nuclease has strong structural and functional similarity to the FEN1 nuclease family. We have shown previously that T4 32 protein binds DNA behind the nuclease and increases its processivity. Here we show that T4 RNase H with a C-terminal deletion (residues 278–305) retains its exonuclease activity but is no longer affected by 32 protein. T4 gene 45 replication clamp stimulates T4 RNase H on nicked or gapped substrates, where it can be loaded behind the nuclease, but does not increase its processivity. An N-terminal deletion (residues 2–10) of a conserved clamp interaction motif eliminates stimulation by the clamp. In the crystal structure of T4 RNase H, the binding sites for the clamp at the N terminus and for 32 protein at the C terminus are located close together, away from the catalytic site of the enzyme. By using mutant T4 RNase H with deletions in the binding site for either the clamp or 32 protein, we show that it is the interaction of T4 RNase H with 32 protein, rather than the clamp, that most affects the maturation of lagging strand fragments in the T4 replication system in vitro and T4 phage production in vivo.

DNA synthesis on the lagging strand of the replication fork is accomplished by the rapid repetition of a cycle in which primase makes a short RNA primer that is elongated by polymerase; the primer is removed from the previous fragment, and the two fragments are joined by DNA ligase. The efficient sealing of adjacent fragments is essential to maintain the accuracy of DNA replication. The accumulation of nicks and gaps on the lagging strand ultimately results in double-stranded breaks, increased mutation frequencies, and cell lethality (reviewed in Refs. 1.Liu Y. Kao H.-I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar and 2.Henneke G. Friedrich-Heineken E. Hubscher U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The lagging strand cycle must be repeated every few seconds because the discontinuous fragments are so short, 1–2 kb in prokaryotes and less than 200 bases in eukaryotes. In each of the replication systems studied, the primers are removed by a member of a family of 5′-nucleases with conserved sequences and similar structures (Fig. 1). It is important that the process of primer removal from one fragment is coordinated with the elongation of the next fragment to ensure rapid and accurate replication. Our studies indicate that the mechanism by which lagging strand polymerization and primer removal are coordinated in bacteriophage T4 replication is different from that used in eukaryotes. The phage T4 member of the FEN1 nuclease family was called T4 RNase H because it hydrolyzed the RNA strand in an RNA:DNA hybrid, as expected for an enzyme removing the RNA primers. However, it also acts as a 5′-nuclease on DNA duplexes (3.Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies indicate that either T4 RNase H or the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease of the Escherichia coli host DNA polymerase I is necessary for phage production (4.Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A T4 mutant with a large deletion (Δ118–305) in the rnh gene gives a burst size of 50% of wild type T4 phage in a wild type host, but a burst of only a few phage per infected cell under nonpermissive conditions in E. coli PolA12, which has a conditionally lethal mutation in the host nuclease. Short DNA fragments accumulate, consistent with a defect in removing the primers from lagging strand fragments that prevents ligation of adjacent fragments. Phage production is restored by supplying T4 RNase H on a plasmid. The T4 rnh deletion mutant is also hypersensitive to UV irradiation and to antitumor agents that induce T4 topoisomerase cleavage products (5.Woodworth D.L. Kreuzer K.N. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is defective in DNA homing (6.Huang Y.-J. Parker M.M. Belfort M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1501-1512PubMed Google Scholar). Processing of the RNA transcript that serves as the primer for leading strand synthesis at the T4 uvsY origin appears to be impaired in the T4 rnh mutant (7.Belanger K.G. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The 5′-nucleases in this family have both a 5′-exonuclease activity that degrades RNA:DNA and DNA:DNA duplexes, giving short oligonucleotide products, and a flap endonuclease activity that cuts close to the junction of single- and double-stranded DNA on fork and flap substrates (reviewed in Ref. 1.Liu Y. Kao H.-I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The relative strength of these two activities differs within the family, with the exonuclease stronger in the phage enzymes (T4 RNase H (8.Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and T5 5′ to 3′-exonuclease (9.Pickering T. Garforth S. Thorpe S. Sayers J. Grasby J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)) and the flap endonuclease stronger in the FEN proteins (10.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The 5′-exonuclease activity of T4 RNase H is nonprocessive, removing a single oligonucleotide (predominantly dimers and trimers) each time it binds its substrate. On substrates where the T4 gene 32 ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RPA, replication protein A; pol, polymerase; b, base; gp, gene product.-binding protein can bind behind the nuclease, its processivity is increased, so that a total of about 10 short oligonucleotides are hydrolyzed at each binding. However, the flap endonuclease of T4 RNase H is inhibited when 32 protein binds to the single-stranded flap (8.Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similarly, FEN1 cutting of flaps long enough to bind RPA, the eukaryotic counterpart of 32 protein, is inhibited when RPA is present (1.Liu Y. Kao H.-I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In the bacteriophage T4 replication system, the polymerase is held on the primer by the gene 45 clamp, which is loaded by the 44/62 clamp loader complex. T4 32 protein plays a major role in orchestrating the lagging strand cycle by increasing primer synthesis, promoting loading of the clamp by the clamp loader, and increasing the processivity of both polymerase and RNase H (11.Nossal N.G. Karem J. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 43-53Google Scholar, 12.Benkovic S.J. Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that T4 RNase H removes the RNA primers and about 30 nucleotides of adjacent DNA from each lagging strand fragment during DNA replication in vitro, and that it is the 5′-exonuclease activity, rather than the flap endonuclease, that is responsible for most of this digestion (13.Bhagwat M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28516-28524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our studies indicated that, on most molecules, polymerase filled in the gap between adjacent fragments before the nuclease could bind for a second round of degradation. The amount of DNA removed along with the primers was similar to the DNA removed during a single binding by T4 RNase H, when 32 protein was behind it. Thus our studies were consistent with a model in which the extent of degradation was controlled by the difference in rates of digestion by T4 RNase H and synthesis by polymerase, when 32 protein covered the single-stranded DNA between them. In eukaryotic DNA replication, both FEN1 nuclease and the nuclease activity of the Dna2 helicase-nuclease have roles in removing primers from eukaryotic lagging strand fragments (reviewed in Refs. 1.Liu Y. Kao H.-I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar and 14.Hubscher U. Seo Y.S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 12: 149-157Google Scholar).

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14298-14303Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) indicate that, in contrast to T4 RNase H, FEN1 uses its flap endonuclease to remove the primer and adjacent DNA, after a flap is created by the polymerase extending the upstream fragment. The rate of strand displacement synthesis by Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol δ with the PCNA clamp and replication factor C clamp loader is increased by FEN1, so that these four proteins together catalyze efficient nick translation. The interaction between FEN1 and the PCNA replication clamp is clearly important, because there was less strand displacement synthesis with a FEN1 protein with a mutation in the C-terminal PCNA interaction site (16.Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1618-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that T4 RNase H, like FEN1, is stimulated by its replication clamp, the T4 gene 45 protein. However, in contrast to FEN1, T4 RNase H interaction with the 45 clamp is not required for the normal processing of lagging strand fragments. Instead, it is the T4 RNase H interaction with 32 protein that is essential. T4 RNase H interacts with the clamp through a conserved clamp-binding motif at the N terminus of the nuclease. A C-terminal helical bundle at the C terminus of the nuclease is needed for its stimulation by 32 protein. An N-terminal deletion in T4 RNase H that prevents stimulation by the clamp does not decrease fragment sealing in the T4 replication system in vitro. Plasmid encoding this mutant T4 RNase H can replace the wild type in restoring production of T4 phage with a disrupted rnh gene. C-terminal deletions that abolish T4 RNase H interaction with 32 protein strongly impair fragment maturation in vitro and fail to restore T4 Δrnh mutant phage production in vivo. DNA Substrates—Oligonucleotides were made and reverse phase-purified by Sigma-Genosys, except that oligonucleotides longer than 50 bases were gel-purified.

The reactions were stopped by heating to 60 °C, the products digested with BstNI nuclease, and then heated for 3 min at 95 °C before electrophoresis. The [32P] 86-mer was elongated past the BstNI site, giving a 143-base restriction product in the absence of T4 RNase H (reactions 7 and 8). The products shorter than 143 bases are a measure of hydrolysis by the exonuclease activity of T4 RNase H (reactions 1, 3, and 5). The 191-base products are molecules ligated following T4 RNase H digestion to expose a 5′-phosphate, and gap filling by polymerase (reactions 2, 4, and 6). * marks the position of 32P on the 86-mer. Conditions for the replication and BstNI restriction reactions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Products are displayed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Coupled Leading and Lagging Strand Synthesis—The reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 1.6 nm singly nicked pUCNICK plasmid (2.7 kb), 2 mm ATP, 250 μm of each dNTP including [α-32P] dTTP (∼1800 cpm/pmol), 250 μm CTP, GTP, and UTP, 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 60 mm potassium acetate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The protein concentrations were 2 μm 32 ssDNA-binding protein, 328 nm 41 helicase, 30 nm wild type DNA polymerase, 242 nm 44/62 clamp loader, 162 nm 45 clamp, 95 nm 59 helicase loading protein, and 64 nm 61 primase. When indicated, RNase H was 100 nm, and DNA ligase was 200 Weiss units/ml. Reaction mixtures without polymerase, primase, helicase, RNase H, and DNA ligase were incubated for 2 min at 37 °C, and synthesis was begun by the addition of polymerase, primase, and helicase. RNase H and DNA ligase were added 1 min later. At the times indicated, aliquots of the reaction mixtures were mixed with an equal volume of 0.2 m EDTA to stop the synthesis, and the products were analyzed by 0.6% alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis (24.Venkatesan M.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmids Encoding T4 RNase H Mutant Proteins—The C-terminal deletion of T4 RNase H ΔC 278–305 (ΔC) was made by cutting plasmid pNN2202 (3.Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (wild type T4 RNase H under the control of the T7 promoter) partially with SspI and totally with EcoRI restriction nucleases, and ligating the duplex made by annealing 5′-ATTGCTTCAAACATTGTGAATTACTATAATTCATAGTAG with 3′-TAACGAAGTTTGTAACACTTAATGATATTAAGTATCATCTTAA to the 3936-bp fragment. The Δ286–305 and Δ295–305 deletions were made by cutting with DraIII and EcoRI nucleases and inserting duplexes made by annealing 5′-GTGGCAAAATTTAG with 3′-GCGCACCGTTTTAAATCTTAA and 5′-GTGGCAAAATTTATTCATATTTTGTAAAAGCGGGTCTTTAG with 3′GCGCACCGTTTTAAATAAGTATAAAACATTTTCGCCCAGAAATCTTAA, respectively. The ΔN 2–10 deletion was made by cutting pNQ1004 (wild type T4 RNase H in the pNN1901 T7 vector (3.Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) with NdeI and PshAI nucleases and inserting the duplex formed from 5′-TATGTACAAAGAAGGAATCTGCTTAATTGACTT and 3′-ACATGTTTCTTCCTTAGACGAATTAACTGAA. Point mutations in the N-terminal region of T4 RNase H were made by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type gene in the plasmid pV-C2001 (3.Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the method of Kunkel et al. (25.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar), modified by using T4 DNA polymerase, T4 44/64 clamp loader, and 45 clamp to copy the ssDNA template. The oligonucleotide primers (the sequence complementary to the mutation codon is underlined) used are as follows: L3A, 5′-CCAACATCATTTCTGCATCCATATATATCTCC; M6A, 5′-GTAATCTTCATCCAACGCCATTTCTAAATCC; L3A,M6A, 5′-GTAATCTTCATCCAACGCCATTTCTGCATCCATATATATCTCC; M5A, 5′-CTTCATCCAACATCGCTTCTAAATCCATATATATCTCC; and D8A, 5′-CCTTCTTTGTAATCTTCAGCCAACATCATTTCTAAATCC. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of the Mutant Proteins—All of the plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (26.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6004) Google Scholar) for expression of the proteins. With the exception of ΔC-(278–305), the mutant proteins were induced with isopropyl thioglucoside for 2 h at 37 °C, as described for the wild type protein (20.Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. Hobbs L.J. Spacciapoli P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and partially purified by the small scale procedure described in Ref. 27.Bhagwat M. Meara D. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28531-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. For ΔC-(278–305), plasmid pMB5002 in BL21(DE3)pLysS was grown in Luria Broth with 50 μg/ml of carbenicillin (Invitrogen) at 24 °C to A600 = 0.4 in a 20-liter New Brunswick Scientific BioFlo 3000 fermentor, and protein synthesis was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl thioglucoside. The cells (45 g) were harvested after overnight induction, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and broken by sonication, and the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. T4 RNase H was purified from the supernatant by chromatography first on SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and then on Poros-S (Perspective Biosystems) by using linear gradients formed from PC buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) and PC buffer B (PC, buffer A containing 750 mm NaCl). Complementation of Bacteriophage T4 Δrnh by Plasmids Encoding Wild Type and Mutant T4 RNase H—T4 Δrnh (4.Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has a deletion of residues 118–305 in the gene encoding T4 RNase H. The host E. coli MIC2003, an rnhA339::catpolA12 derivative of E. coli FB2 (28.Itaya M. Crouch R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), has an interruption in the gene for RNase HI and a temperature-sensitive mutation in DNA pol I affecting its 5′-nuclease. The host also contained pGP1.2 (29.Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar), a plasmid with the gene for T7 RNA polymerase under the temperature controlled PL promoter, as well as a compatible plasmid with T4 RNase H under control of the T7 promoter as follows: pNQ1004 (wild type), pNQ1101 (ΔN-(Δ2–10)), pMB5002 (ΔC-(Δ278–305)), pGO1701 (ΔC-(Δ286–305)), pGO1801(ΔC-(Δ295–305)), or the pVex11 vector (see Refs. 3.Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 4.Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and this paper). Cells were grown in LB media with 60 μg/ml kanomycin and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin to 1 × 10 8/ml at 30 °C, shifted to 43 °C for 15 min to induce production of T7 RNA polymerase and disrupt the polA12 DNA polymerase, and then infected with wild type T4D or T4 Δrnh at a multiplicity of 0.5 phage/bacteria. Infective centers were determined by plating on E. coli CR63 after 5 min. Total phage were measured at 60 min, after lysis with chloroform. T4 RNase H Exonuclease Activity Is Stimulated When the T4 Gene 45 Clamp Protein Is Loaded Behind It—The T4 gene 45 replication clamp protein is loaded preferentially at the 3′ end of a junction between single- and double-stranded DNA and at the 3′ side of a nick (11.Nossal N.G. Karem J. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 43-53Google Scholar, 12.Benkovic S.J. Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), whereas T4 RNase H is loaded at the 5′ end (3.Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1C and diagrams at the top of Fig. 2A). The clamp protein can move in both directions on the duplex DNA. It can also track for short distances on single-stranded DNA but falls off single-stranded DNA more rapidly than double-stranded DNA (30.Sanders G.M. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3966-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, the nicked, gapped, and partial duplex substrates were made by annealing oligonucleotides to single-stranded circular DNA and were labeled at the 3′ end of the downstream 86-base fragment. Addition of the T4 clamp, clamp loader, and ATP stimulates the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease on the nicked substrate (Fig. 2A, lane 9) and on the substrate with the 28-base gap (lane 14), where the clamp can be loaded behind the nuclease but does not stimulate on the partial duplex (lane 4). The nuclease, by itself, has similar activity on the partial duplex and the gapped molecule (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 12) but has very little activity on the nicked substrate (lane 7), where there is no single-stranded DNA behind the 3′-labeled duplex. As we have shown previously (8.Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), 32 protein increases the processivity of the nuclease when there is single-stranded DNA behind the nuclease (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 13). However, it does not increase the nuclease activity on the nicked substrate (Fig. 2A, lane 8). There will be more clamp loaded in front of the nuclease in reactions with 32 protein because 32 protein increases the loading of the clamp by the clamp loader (31.Richardson R.W. Ellis R.L. Nossal N.G. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 127: 247-259Google Scholar, 32.Capson T.L. Benkovic S.J. Nossal N.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interference by this increased clamp in front of the nuclease is the likely reason that there is less activity on the nicked substrate when 32 protein is present in addition to the clamp, clamp loader, and ATP (compare Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10, and Fig. 2B, reactions 4 and 5). When polymerase is present to extend the duplex available to the clamp ahead of the nuclease, there is no longer inhibition by 32 protein (Fig. 2B, compare reactions 12 and 13). Note that in Fig. 2B, the reaction products were cut with BstNI restriction nuclease to allow determination of the extent of hydrolysis at the 5′ end. ATP and the T4 gene 44/62 clamp loader are needed in addition to the clamp for stimulation of T4 RNase H activity on nicked substrates. This is shown, using 5′ end-labeled substrates, in Fig. 3. Addition of the clamp did not change the size of the oligonucleotides removed by the nuclease, which are predominantly dimers and trimers (8.Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The same size distribution is observed when a 5′-labeled partial duplex is cut by the nuclease alone (Fig. 3, reaction 2), and when the nicked substrate is cut in the presence of the clamp, clamp loader, and ATP (reaction 10). The T4 clamp can move along single-stranded DNA, but it falls off more rapidly than on a duplex (30.Sanders G.M. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3966-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33.Fu T.J. Sanders G.M. O'Donnell M. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We detected some stimulation of RNase H when the gap between the nucleotides was increased from 28 to 100 bases, but none with a gap of 200 bases (Fig. 4). The Clamp Does Not Increase the Processivity of T4 RNase H—Circular replication clamps surrounding the DNA tether their respective polymerases on the template, thus increasing their processivity (number of nucleotides added per polymerase binding). We have shown previously that T4 RNase H by itself is nonprocessive, hydrolyzing a single small oligonucleotide with each binding, but that the nuclease becomes processive when the T4 gene 32 protein is added (8.Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract F"
