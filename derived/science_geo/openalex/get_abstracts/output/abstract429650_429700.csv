Unambiguous constraints on the fraction of massive stars affected by binary interaction were lacking. We simultaneously measured all relevant binary characteristics in a sample of Galactic massive O stars and quantified the frequency and nature of binary interactions. Over seventy per cent of all massive stars will exchange mass with a companion, leading to a binary merger in one third of the cases. These numbers greatly exceed previous estimates and imply that binary interaction dominates the evolution of massive stars, with implications for populations of massive stars and their supernovae."

A major barrier to achieving a cure in patients infected with HIV-1 is the ability of the HIV genome to integrate into the DNA of resting CD4+ T cells and adopt a state of latency, evading both immune detection and pharmaceutical attack. It was shown previously that induction of virus gene expression in latently HIV-1-infected cells can be achieved in vitro with histone deacetylase inhibitors such as vorinostat, a drug used to treat cutaneous lymphoma. In this study, the authors report the first in vivo evidence that vorinostat can disrupt proviral latency of HIV-1. Vorinostat has some toxic effects that would need to be considered when assessing the risks and benefits of attempts to eradicate HIV infection using this or similar drugs. Despite antiretroviral therapy, proviral latency of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remains a principal obstacle to curing the infection1. Inducing the expression of latent genomes within resting CD4+ T cells is the primary strategy to clear this reservoir2,3. Although histone deacetylase inhibitors such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (also known as vorinostat, VOR) can disrupt HIV-1 latency in vitro4,5,6, the utility of this approach has never been directly proven in a translational clinical study of HIV-infected patients. Here we isolated the circulating resting CD4+ T cells of patients in whom viraemia was fully suppressed by antiretroviral therapy, and directly studied the effect of VOR on this latent reservoir. In each of eight patients, a single dose of VOR increased both biomarkers of cellular acetylation, and simultaneously induced an increase in HIV RNA expression in resting CD4+ cells (mean increase, 4.8-fold). This demonstrates that a molecular mechanism known to enforce HIV latency can be therapeutically targeted in humans, provides proof-of-concept for histone deacetylase inhibitors as a therapeutic class, and defines a precise approach to test novel strategies to attack and eradicate latent HIV infection directly."
https://openalex.org/W2017614891,"Mutations in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 are shown to predispose mice to colitis as a consequence of neutral amino acid malabsorption and a change in the resident microbiota; these results could explain how protein malnutrition — affecting up to one billion people — leads to intestinal inflammation. Malnutrition affects many millions of people in the developing world and remains a problem in wealthy nations, especially for disadvantaged groups. In many cases, it is the associated diarrhoea and intestinal inflammation that cause morbidity and death. A study published in this issue presents a molecular explanation for the increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation in malnutrition. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has a central role in blood-pressure regulation and has been implicated in diabetes, heart failure and viral infection, is shown to influence dietary amino-acid homeostasis, innate immunity, gut microbial ecology and susceptibility to colitis. Mice deficient in this enzyme show impaired tryptophan metabolism and develop colitis, which is alleviated by dietary tryptophan and its metabolite, nicotinamide. This surprising result explains nutritional effects that have been known for centuries and provides a molecular link between malnutrition and the intestinal microbiome. Malnutrition affects up to one billion people in the world and is a major cause of mortality1,2. In many cases, malnutrition is associated with diarrhoea and intestinal inflammation, further contributing to morbidity and death2. The mechanisms by which unbalanced dietary nutrients affect intestinal homeostasis are largely unknown. Here we report that deficiency in murine angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 2 (Ace2), which encodes a key regulatory enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), results in highly increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation induced by epithelial damage. The RAS is known to be involved in acute lung failure3, cardiovascular functions4 and SARS infections5. Mechanistically, ACE2 has a RAS-independent function, regulating intestinal amino acid homeostasis, expression of antimicrobial peptides, and the ecology of the gut microbiome. Transplantation of the altered microbiota from Ace2 mutant mice into germ-free wild-type hosts was able to transmit the increased propensity to develop severe colitis. ACE2-dependent changes in epithelial immunity and the gut microbiota can be directly regulated by the dietary amino acid tryptophan. Our results identify ACE2 as a key regulator of dietary amino acid homeostasis, innate immunity, gut microbial ecology, and transmissible susceptibility to colitis. These results provide a molecular explanation for how amino acid malnutrition can cause intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea."

Functional analysis of these fusion genes can provide mechanistic insights into tumorigenesis and potentially lead to effective drugs, as famously illustrated by the BCR-ABL gene in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Singh et al. (p. 1231 , published online 26 July) identify and characterize a fusion gene present in 3% of human glioblastomas, a deadly brain cancer. In the resultant fusion protein, the tyrosine kinase region of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) is joined to a domain from a transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) protein. The TACC-FGFR protein is oncogenic, shows unregulated kinase activity, localizes to the mitotic spindle, and disrupts chromosome segregation. In mice, FGFR inhibitors slowed the growth of tumors driven by the TACC-FGFR gene, suggesting that a subset of glioblastoma patients may benefit from these types of drugs."

The neural mechanisms of this facilitation remain largely unclear. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques to measure both the amplitude and representational content of neural activity in the early visual cortex of human volunteers. We find that while perceptual expectation reduces the neural response amplitude in the primary visual cortex (V1), it improves the stimulus representation in this area, as revealed by MVPA. This informational improvement was independent of attentional modulations by task relevance. Finally, the informational improvement in V1 correlated with subjects’ behavioral improvement when the expected stimulus feature was relevant. These data suggest that expectation facilitates perception by sharpening sensory representations.

These data suggest that expectation facilitates perception by sharpening sensory representations. Prior expectation facilitates visual perception Valid expectation leads to reduced sensory activity Valid expectation leads to enhanced sensory representation Prior expectation sharpens the stimulus representation in sensory cortex Top-down expectations about the visual world can facilitate perception by allowing us to quickly deduce plausible interpretations from noisy and ambiguous data (Bar, 2004Bar M. Visual objects in context.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). However, the neural mechanisms of this facilitation are largely unknown. A theory that has gained growing popularity in the last decade surmises that vision can be cast as a process of hierarchical Bayesian inference, in which higher order cortical regions provide guidance to lower levels, thereby facilitating sensory processing (Friston, 2005Friston K.J. A theory of cortical responses.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar; Lee and Mumford, 2003Lee T.S. Mumford D.

Kersten D. Vision as Bayesian inference: analysis by synthesis?.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2006; 10: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Within this framework, it has been put forward that higher order regions may suppress the predictable, and hence redundant, neural responses in early sensory regions that are consistent with current high level expectations (Mumford, 1992Mumford D.

Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar), resulting in a sparse and efficient coding scheme (Jehee et al., 2006Jehee J.F.M. Rothkopf C. Beck J.M. Ballard D.H. Learning receptive fields using predictive feedback.J. Physiol. Paris. 2006; 100: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; Olshausen and Field, 1996Olshausen B.A. Field D.J. Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images.Nature. 1996; 381: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (4033) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that higher order regions may rather “sharpen” sensory representations in early cortical areas, by suppressing lower order neural responses that are inconsistent with current expectations (Lee and Mumford, 2003Lee T.S. Mumford D. Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex.J. Opt. Soc. Am. A Opt. Image Sci. Vis. 2003; 20: 1434-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). This could be done either directly, through inhibitory feedback, or indirectly, by excitatory feedback to neurons representing the expected feature, which in turn engage in competitive interactions with alternative representations at the lower level (Spratling, 2008Spratling M.W. Predictive coding as a model of biased competition in visual attention.Vision Res. 2008; 48: 1391-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Such a coding scheme would result in a “sharpening” of the population response in early sensory regions for expected percepts. It should be noted that both these mechanisms are incorporated in a more recent model of predictive coding (Friston, 2005Friston K.J. A theory of cortical responses.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar), which posits two functionally distinct subpopulations of neurons, encoding the conditional expectations of perceptual causes and the prediction error, respectively (Jehee and Ballard, 2009Jehee J.F.

Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). In this scheme, high-level predictions explain away prediction error, thus silencing error neurons, while neurons encoding sensory causes rapidly converge on the (correctly) predicted causes, yielding a relatively sharp population response. While empirical studies have provided some empirical support for both the above scenarios by showing a reduction of neural activity in early sensory regions as a result of top-down expectation (Alink et al., 2010Alink A.

Prior expectation mediates neural adaptation to repeated sounds in the auditory cortex: an MEG study.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9118-9123Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), these studies could not adjudicate between these two models and answer the question of how top-down expectation alters sensory processing. Here, we capitalize on the fact that these hypotheses make opposite predictions about how expectation changes the amount of information present in these regions. If expectation operates by suppressing neural responses that are consistent with the current expectation, the activity reduction in early sensory cortex should be accompanied by a reduction of the sensory representation in this region. If, on the other hand, expectation sharpens the population response, the activity reduction in early sensory cortex should be accompanied by an improved sensory representation in this region. We adjudicated between these hypotheses by noninvasively measuring neural activity and representational content in the early visual cortex of human volunteers, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques (Haxby et al., 2001Haxby J.V. Gobbini M.I. Furey M.L. Ishai A. Schouten J.L. Pietrini P.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Our results provide evidence for a sharpening account of expectation, in which overall neural activity is reduced, yet the stimulus representation is enhanced by expectation. During each trial, subjects were presented with two consecutively presented grating stimuli. Before each trial, we induced an expectation about the overall orientation (∼45° or ∼135°) of these gratings by means of an auditory cue (Figure 1 and Experimental Procedures). Subjects had to perform either an orientation task on the stimuli (indicate whether the second grating was slightly tilted clockwise or anticlockwise with respect to the first) or a contrast task (indicate whether the second grating had higher or lower contrast than the first), thereby manipulating the task relevance of the expectation. Behavioral data confirmed that subjects were able to discriminate small differences in orientation (3.5° with 81.8% accuracy) and contrast (4.5% with 75.1% accuracy). Angular and contrast differences between the two gratings were manipulated throughout the experiment by an adaptive staircase procedure, for trials containing expected and unexpected orientations separately (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). This was done to rule out a potential confound of task difficulty with the effects of expectation on neural activity. For the orientation task, the staircase procedure adjusted the angle difference to a smaller value for expected than unexpected trials (mean angle difference of 3.4° versus 3.8°: t17 = 2.8, p = 0.013), while keeping accuracy roughly equated (81% versus 84%: t17 = −1.9, p = 0.070), suggesting that expectation had a facilitatory effect on perceptual performance. For the contrast task, there was a nonsignificant trend toward slightly smaller contrast differences for trials containing expected than unexpected orientations (mean contrast difference of 4.3% versus 5.0%: t17 = 1.9, p = 0.075), while accuracy was again roughly equated (74% versus 78%: t17 = −1.9, p = 0.077). Reaction times did not differ between conditions (orientation task: mean RT = 761 ms, for both expected and unexpected trials; contrast task: mean RT = 765 ms for expected, and 767 ms for unexpected trials). Neuroimaging data showed that gratings with an expected orientation evoked a reduced response in primary visual cortex, compared to gratings with an unexpected orientation (Figure 2A, bars), in line with previous results (Alink et al., 2010Alink A. Schwiedrzik C.M. Kohler A. Singer W. Muckli L. Stimulus predictability reduces responses in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar; den Ouden et al., 2009den Ouden H.E.M. Friston K.J. Daw N.D. McIntosh A.R. Stephan K.E. A dual role for prediction error in associative learning.Cereb. Cortex. 2009; 19: 1175-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This neural suppression by expectation was robustly present during both tasks (F1,17 = 14.3, p = 0.002) and did not differ between tasks (F1,17 = 1.4, p > 0.1). This expectation-induced suppression was also observed in V2 and V3 (Figure S1A). There were no overall activity differences in these regions between tasks (all F1,17 < 1, p > 0.1), which is expected given that these regions are involved in processing both contrast and orientation of stimuli. Next, we asked whether the reduction of activity in V1 was paired with a decrease or increase in representational content (or stimulus information) in this area. In order to investigate this issue, we used MVPA methods (see Experimental Procedures) to classify the overall orientation of the two gratings presented in each trial (∼45° or ∼135°). If orientation classification performance is selectively enhanced/reduced for expected gratings (compared with unexpected gratings), then this would imply that expectation increases/decreases the orientation-selectivity of responses in V1. First, in line with earlier reports (Jehee et al., 2011Jehee J.F.M. Brady D.K. Tong F. Attention improves encoding of task-relevant features in the human visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 8210-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar; Kamitani and Tong, 2005Kamitani Y. Tong F. Decoding the visual and subjective contents of the human brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar), we found that task relevance enhanced orientation classification accuracy: accuracy was overall higher during the orientation task than during the contrast task (F1,17 = 8.2, p = 0.011; Figure 2A). Critically, despite the reduction in neuronal response, MVPA orientation classification accuracy was further improved for gratings with an expected orientation, compared to an unexpected orientation (F1,17 = 8.3, p = 0.010, Figure 2A). The effects of task relevance and prior expectation were additive and did not interact (F < 1, p > 0.1). These results were obtained using the 150 most stimulus-responsive voxels (as determined through an independent functional localizer; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), but the effects were largely independent of the amount of voxels selected (Figures 2B and 2C). Unlike in V1, expectation did not significantly affect orientation classification accuracy in V2 and V3 (Figure S1). This difference between V1 and higher-order visual areas might be due to stimulus characteristics (e.g., the high spatial frequencies in the grating stimuli may have preferentially activated V1), or they might represent a real difference in the extent to which top-down expectation affects representations in V1 versus V2 and V3, as has been previously suggested (Smith and Muckli, 2010Smith F.W. Muckli L. Nonstimulated early visual areas carry information about surrounding context.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 20099-20103Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). If the expectation-induced reduction of neural activity reflects a sharpening of neural activity, it might be expected that the effect is strongest in neurons preferring orientations different from the currently presented orientation, while neurons preferring the presented orientation are relatively unsuppressed. To examine this, we calculated the expectation suppression separately for voxels preferring the presented and the non-presented orientation (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). Indeed, expectation suppression was significantly greater in the latter set of voxels, in line with a sharpening account of expectation (t17 = 2.2, p = 0.039; Figure S2A). This account further predicts a quantitative relationship between orientation preference and expectation suppression: when the preference of a voxel for the presented orientation is stronger, the expectation suppression should be smaller. This prediction was confirmed by a significant negative correlation across voxels between their preference for the presented orientation and the corresponding expectation suppression effect (r = −0.292, p < 0.001; Figure S2B). Is the expectation-induced reduction of neural activity and increase in representational content relevant for perception? To explore this issue, we assessed the relationship between behavioral and neural effects of expectation. We quantified orientation discrimination thresholds separately for expected and unexpected gratings during the orientation task. If expectation-induced behavioral benefits are linked to increased representational content in V1, we would expect a correlation between intersubject variation in the expectation-induced reduction in orientation discrimination threshold (behavioral improvement) and the expectation-induced improvement in MVPA orientation classifier performance (neural improvement). Indeed, we observed such a correlation (r = 0.53, p = 0.023; Figure 3A). Since the orientation discrimination threshold was directly related to the angle difference between gratings, due to the staircase procedure, we applied the same analysis to the data from the contrast task, and found no such relationship there (r < 0.01, p = 0.990; Figure 3B). This precludes an explanation of our results in terms of physical stimulus differences, since these were roughly equal between tasks (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Further analyses confirmed that differences in MVPA orientation classification accuracy were not related to physical stimulus differences (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for a full description). First, no across-subject correlations were found between stimulus differences and MVPA orientation classification accuracy, neither within nor between expectation conditions (Figure S3). Second, there were no within-subject correlations between trial-by-trial orientation angle differences and MVPA accuracy, for either expected (r = −0.02, t17 = −1.3, p = 0.220) or unexpected (r = −0.04, t17 = −1.1, p = 0.287) gratings. Third, binning trials on the basis of angle differences revealed no differences in MVPA orientation classification in any of the early visual cortex regions for “large orientation difference versus small orientation difference” (Figure S2C). Fourth, an analysis in which stimulus differences between conditions were removed by selecting a subset of the trials still revealed significantly higher orientation classification accuracy for expected than unexpected grating orientations (62.5% versus 57.5%, t13 = 2.1, p = 0.028; Figure S2D). Finally, we ran a control experiment in which stimulus attributes were exactly equalized between tasks and expectation conditions. Again, a valid expectation of the orientation angle of the gratings led to a reduction in BOLD response amplitude (F1,7 = 7.2, p = 0.016), but an increase in MVPA orientation classification accuracy, in V1 (F1,7 = 3.6, p = 0.050; Figure S2E). Together, these results preclude an explanation of our results in terms of within-trial stimulus differences between conditions. In order to investigate the relationship between effects of top-down expectation and stimulus repetition, we separately calculated MVPA orientation classification accuracy for trials containing the same (“repetitions”) or different (“alternations”) grating orientations (45° or 135°) as the previous trial (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This analysis revealed a significant main effect of expectation (F1,17 < 9.0, p = 0.008), but not of repetition (F1,17 < 1, p > 0.1). This precludes an explanation of our results in terms of repetition effects. Interestingly, there was also a marginally significant interaction between expectation and repetition (F1,17 = 4.2, p = 0.056), indicating that the effect of expectation on MVPA classification accuracy was larger for alternation than for repetition trials (Figure S2F). This could potentially be explained by the fact that repetition of a stimulus in itself already sharpens stimulus representations (Desimone, 1996Desimone R. Neural mechanisms for visual memory and their role in attention.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 13494-13499Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar; Moldakarimov et al., 2010Moldakarimov S. Bazhenov M. Sejnowski T.J. Representation sharpening can explain perceptual priming.Neural Comput. 2010; 22: 1312-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), reducing the effect of any additional top-down sharpening, while the opposite is true for alternation trials. We observed a striking dissociation between the effects of expectation on the amount of neural activity and the information that can be gleaned from the neural activity pattern. Whereas expectation leads to suppressed responses in V1, it concurrently enhances the amount of information about the orientation of the stimulus. Crucially, this pattern of results is exactly what is predicted by the “sharpening” hypothesis of expectation, in which bottom-up sensory signals that are incongruent with prior expectations are relatively suppressed (Lee and Mumford, 2003Lee T.S. Mumford D. Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex.J. Opt. Soc. Am. A Opt. Image Sci. Vis. 2003; 20: 1434-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The sharpening hypothesis was further corroborated by the fact that the expectation-induced reduction of neural activity was less strong in voxels preferring the currently presented orientation than in voxels preferring the nonpresented orientation. This sharpening has behavioral ramifications for fine-grained orientation discrimination performance, reflected by the fact that subjects were better able to judge small differences in orientation for expected gratings. This behavioral improvement correlated with the improvement of the neural signal as measured by MVPA, in line with theories of representational sharpening due to perceptual priming (Desimone, 1996Desimone R.

Predictive coding as a model of biased competition in visual attention.Vision Res. 2008; 48: 1391-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), in which separate populations of neurons within a cortical region code the current estimate of sensory causes (predictions) and the mismatch between this estimate and incoming sensory signals (prediction error). Here, we did not manipulate the prior expectation of the occurrence or omission of stimuli (grating stimuli were present in all trials), but the likelihood of the stimulus having a certain feature (i.e., orientation). This calls for a slightly more sophisticated model of hierarchical Bayesian inference that allows for a representation of uncertainty in terms of the precision of future events, an issue which has been addressed recently within the framework of predictive coding (Feldman and Friston, 2010Feldman H. Friston K.J. Attention, uncertainty, and free-energy.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 215Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Bayes-optimal inference in this setting relies upon top-down predictions about the certainty or precision of events that will occur and suggests that prediction error neurons are selectively biased in a top-down manner following a cue. Simulations within this framework suggest that anticipation enhances early prediction error responses to valid stimuli compared to invalid stimuli. Crucially, this prediction error can be cancelled out more quickly, reducing the overall amount of activity, consistent with the reduction in the amplitude of V1 responses under the predictive coding model. However, it also suggests that the signal-to-noise ratio of prediction error responses is enhanced when valid or anticipated targets are processed. In other words, there should be representational sharpening. In this scheme, top-down expectations about future events increase the gain of prediction error neurons encoding the expected stimulus feature, leading to a quick resolution of prediction error if the input matches the expectation (Feldman and Friston, 2010Feldman H. Friston K.J. Attention, uncertainty, and free-energy.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 215Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar; Summerfield and Koechlin, 2008Summerfield C. Koechlin E. A neural representation of prior information during perceptual inference.Neuron. 2008; 59: 336-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). If, on the other hand, the expectation is violated, a large prediction error will ensue, leading to an increase in neural activity (Alink et al., 2010Alink A. Schwiedrzik C.M. Kohler A. Singer W.

Prior expectation mediates neural adaptation to repeated sounds in the auditory cortex: an MEG study.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9118-9123Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Also, the activity pattern in prediction neurons will contain a mixture of neurons coding the expected (due to top-down biasing) and the actually presented (due to bottom-up input) orientations, yielding a noisy population response. The effects of top-down expectation were observed alongside the previously observed improvements in neuronal representation as a function of task relevance (Jehee et al., 2011Jehee J.F.M. Brady D.K. Tong F. Attention improves encoding of task-relevant features in the human visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 8210-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar; Kamitani and Tong, 2005Kamitani Y. Tong F. Decoding the visual and subjective contents of the human brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar), and indeed, the effects of task-relevance and expectation were additive. However, while there were no overall differences in BOLD activity between the different tasks, expectation induced a strong reduction of BOLD activity. This suggests that expectation and attentional task-set may be partly distinct processes, as has been previously argued (Summerfield and Egner, 2009Summerfield C. Egner T. Expectation (and attention) in visual cognition.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2009; 13: 403-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Although the relationship between neuronal excitation and inhibition and the hemodynamic (or metabolic) response is equivocal and multifaceted (Logothetis, 2008Logothetis N.K. What we can do and what we cannot do with fMRI.Nature. 2008; 453: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar), the activity reductions observed here for expected stimuli likely reflect a reduction of neural activity. This is in line with recent neurophysiological studies in monkeys and humans, highlighting that valid expectations lead to a reduction in spiking activity (Meyer and Olson, 2011Meyer T. Olson C.R. Statistical learning of visual transitions in monkey inferotemporal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 19401-19406Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) as well as gamma-band oscillatory activity (Todorovic et al., 2011Todorovic A. van Ede F. Maris E. de Lange F.P. Prior expectation mediates neural adaptation to repeated sounds in the auditory cortex: an MEG study.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9118-9123Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent combined hemodynamic/neurophysiological study reported hemodynamic and metabolic downregulation following neuronal inhibition in the visual cortex of monkeys (Shmuel et al., 2006Shmuel A. Augath M. Oeltermann A. Logothetis N.K. Negative functional MRI response correlates with decreases in neuronal activity in monkey visual area V1.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In sum, our data provide evidence for how expectations facilitate perceptual inference in a noisy and ambiguous visual world by sharpening early sensory representations. Twenty healthy right-handed individuals (sixteen female, age 22 ± 4, mean ± SD) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision gave written informed consent to participate in this study, in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the local ethics committee (CMO region Arnhem-Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Data from one subject were excluded due to excessive head movement, and one subject was excluded due to failure to comply with task instructions. Grayscale luminance-defined sinusoidal grating stimuli were generated using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) in conjunction with the Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997Brainard D.H. The Psychophysics Toolbox.Spat. Vis. 1997; 10: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (13432) Google Scholar), and displayed on a rear-projection screen using a luminance-calibrated EIKI projector (1,024 × 768 resolution, 60 Hz refresh rate). Gratings were displayed in an annulus (outer diameter: 15° of visual angle, inner diameter: 3°), surrounding a fixation point. The auditory cue consisted of a pure tone (450 or 1,000 Hz), presented over MR-compatible earphones. Each trial consisted of an auditory cue, followed by two consecutive grating stimuli (Figure 1). The two grating stimuli were presented for 500 ms each, separated by a blank screen (100 ms). The auditory cue consisted of either a low- (450 Hz) or high-frequency (1000 Hz) tone, which predicted the orientation of the subsequent grating stimuli (∼45° or ∼135°) with 75% validity. The contingencies between cues and gratings were flipped halfway through the experiment, and the order was counterbalanced over subjects. In separate runs (128 trials, ∼14 min), subjects performed either an orientation or a contrast discrimination task on the two gratings. The first grating had an orientation of either 45° or 135° (±a Gaussian jitter, drawn from a normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1) and a luminance contrast of 80%. The second grating differed slightly from the first in terms of both orientation and contrast. When performing the orientation task, subjects had to judge whether the second grating was rotated clockwise or anticlockwise with respect to the first grating. In the contrast task subjects had to judge whether the second grating had lower or higher contrast than the first one. Subjects indicated their response using an MR-compatible button box. The orientation and contrast differences between the two gratings were determined by an adaptive staircase procedure, separately for trials containing expected and unexpected orientations. This was done to yield comparable task difficulty and performance (∼75% correct) for the different conditions (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). All subjects completed four runs (two of each task, order was counterbalanced over subjects) of the experiment, yielding a total of 512 trials. Subsequent to the main experiment, subjects performed a functional localizer task, consisting of flickering gratings, and a retinotopic mapping session (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Functional images were acquired using a 3T Trio MRI system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), with a T2∗-weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR/TE = 1,500/30 ms, 26 transversal slices, voxel size 2 × 2 × 2 mm, interslice gap 20%, GRAPPA acceleration factor of 3). Anatomical images were acquired with a T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequence, using a GRAPPA acceleration factor of 2 (TR/TE = 2,300/3.03 ms, voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm). We used SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) for image preprocessing and analysis. The first six volumes of each subject’s data set were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. All functional images were spatially realigned to the mean image, yielding head movement parameters which were used as nuisance regressors in the general linear model (GLM), and temporally aligned to the first slice of each volume. The structural image was coregistered with the functional volumes. For univariate analyses, functional images were spatially smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 4 mm. Data of each subject were modeled using an event-related approach, within the framework of the GLM. Regressors representing the different conditions (the two tasks and the two expectation conditions) were constructed by convolving the onsets of the first grating in each trial with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and its temporal and dispersion derivatives (Friston et al., 1998Friston K.J. Fletcher P. Josephs O. Holmes A. Rugg M.D. Turner R. Event-related fMRI: characterizing differential responses.Neuroimage. 1998; 7: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). Instruction screens were included as regressors of no interest, as were head motion parameters and their first-order derivatives (Lund et al., 2005Lund T.E. Nørgaard M.D. Rostrup E. Rowe J.B. Paulson O.B. Motion or activity: their role in intra- and inter-subject variation in fMRI.Neuroimage. 2005; 26: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Finally, the data were high-pass filtered (cutoff 128 s) to remove low-frequency signal drifts. Freesurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) was used to identify the boundaries of retinotopic areas in early visual cortex, using well-established methods (DeYoe et al., 1996DeYoe E.A. Carman G.J. Bandettini P. Glickman S. Wieser J. Cox R. Miller D. Neitz J. Mapping striate and extrastriate visual areas in human cerebral cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 2382-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar; Engel et al., 1997Engel S.A. Glover G.H.

Borders of multiple visual areas in humans revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging.Science. 1995; 268: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Within each retinotopic ROI (V1, V2, and V3), we identified the 150 most stimulus-responsive voxels according to their response to the grating stimulus in the independent functional localizer session. Parameter estimates for each condition were averaged over these voxels. The resulting averaged parameter estimates for the (canonical HRF) regressors comprised the data for the second level analysis (i.e., at the between-subject level). For multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA), functional images were not spatially smoothed. Again, the data of each subject were modeled using an event-related approach, but here each trial was modeled by a separate regressor, convolved with a canonical HRF. The exact same voxels were used as for the BOLD amplitude analysis, but now parameter estimates were not averaged over voxels. This procedure yielded a pattern of voxel activations for each single trial. T values (i.e., parameter estimates divided by unexplained variance) obtained for each voxel comprised the data for further analysis (Misaki et al., 2010Misaki M. Kim Y. Bandettini P.A. Kriegeskorte N. Comparison of multivariate classifiers and response normalizations for pattern-information fMRI.Neuroimage. 2010; 53: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These patterns were analyzed using MVPA classification methods (Haxby et al., 2001Haxby J.V. Gobbini M.I. Furey M.L. Ishai A. Schouten J.L. Pietrini P. Distributed and overlapping representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex.Science. 2001; 293: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (2717) Google Scholar; Haynes and Rees, 2005Haynes J.D.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Specifically, we classified the orientation of the observed gratings based on the pattern of BOLD activation in early visual areas (V1, V2, and V3). Classification performance can be seen as an indication of the amount of orientation information available in the BOLD signal, such that relative changes therein can be informative about the effects of expectation and task relevance (Jehee et al., 2011Jehee J.F.M. Brady D.K. Tong F. Attention improves encoding of task-relevant features in the human visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 8210-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Linear support vector machines were applied to a subset of the trials, designated as the training set, in order to find a linear discriminant function. Subsequently, the remaining trials (the test set) were classified as containing one of the two orientations, dependent on the outcome of applying the discriminant function to the accompanying voxel activation pattern (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details).

https://openalex.org/W2010841889,"Although the nervous and immune systems have been classically considered to modulate physiologically distinct functions, recent evidence points to coordinated activities during neurogenic inflammation. In this perspective, the authors examine the interactions between the peripheral nervous system and the immune response during health and disease. The peripheral nervous and immune systems are traditionally thought of as serving separate functions. The line between them is, however, becoming increasingly blurred by new insights into neurogenic inflammation. Nociceptor neurons possess many of the same molecular recognition pathways for danger as immune cells, and, in response to danger, the peripheral nervous system directly communicates with the immune system, forming an integrated protective mechanism. The dense innervation network of sensory and autonomic fibers in peripheral tissues and high speed of neural transduction allows rapid local and systemic neurogenic modulation of immunity. Peripheral neurons also seem to contribute to immune dysfunction in autoimmune and allergic diseases. Therefore, understanding the coordinated interaction of peripheral neurons with immune cells may advance therapeutic approaches to increase host defense and suppress immunopathology."

https://openalex.org/W2163000554,"A ‘Higgs’ mode, signifying the breaking of a continuous symmetry in a model with emergent Lorentz invariance, is found close to the transition to the Mott insulating phase in a two-dimensional neutral superfluid. In relativistic quantum field theory, a broken continuous symmetry leads to the emergence of two types of fundamental excitation: massless Nambu–Goldstone modes and a massive 'Higgs' amplitude mode. An excitation of the Higgs type (made famous through the recent discovery of a Higgs-like boson in particle physics) is expected to appear as a fundamental collective mode in quantum many-body systems. Immanuel Bloch and colleagues unambiguously identify and study a Higgs mode in a two-dimensional neutral superfluid, a first step in the exploration of emergent relativistic models with ultracold atomic gases. Spontaneous symmetry breaking plays a key role in our understanding of nature. In relativistic quantum field theory, a broken continuous symmetry leads to the emergence of two types of fundamental excitation: massless Nambu–Goldstone modes and a massive ‘Higgs’ amplitude mode. An excitation of Higgs type is of crucial importance in the standard model of elementary particle physics1, and also appears as a fundamental collective mode in quantum many-body systems2. Whether such a mode exists in low-dimensional systems as a resonance-like feature, or whether it becomes overdamped through coupling to Nambu–Goldstone modes, has been a subject of debate2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we experimentally find and study a Higgs mode in a two-dimensional neutral superfluid close to a quantum phase transition to a Mott insulating phase. We unambiguously identify the mode by observing the expected reduction in frequency of the onset of spectral response when approaching the transition point. In this regime, our system is described by an effective relativistic field theory with a two-component quantum field2,7, which constitutes a minimal model for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Additionally, all microscopic parameters of our system are known from first principles and the resolution of our measurement allows us to detect excited states of the many-body system at the level of individual quasiparticles. This allows for an in-depth study of Higgs excitations that also addresses the consequences of the reduced dimensionality and confinement of the system. Our work constitutes a step towards exploring emergent relativistic models with ultracold atomic gases."
https://openalex.org/W2027236524,"Neuropathic pain, the most debilitating of all clinical pain syndromes, may be a consequence of trauma, infection or pathology from diseases that affect peripheral nerves. Here we provide a framework for understanding the spinal mechanisms of neuropathic pain as distinct from those of acute pain or inflammatory pain. Recent work suggests that a specific microglia response phenotype characterized by de novo expression of the purinergic receptor P2X4 is critical for the pathogenesis of pain hypersensitivity caused by injury to peripheral nerves. Stimulating P2X4 receptors initiates a core pain signaling pathway mediated by release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which produces a disinhibitory increase in intracellular chloride in nociceptive (pain-transmitting) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. The changes caused by signaling from P2X4R(+) microglia to nociceptive transmission neurons may account for the main symptoms of neuropathic pain in humans, and they point to specific interventions to alleviate this debilitating condition."

The Sandawe currently number more than 30,000 individuals, and following the Bantu expansion, many Sandawe have switched from nomadic hunting to an agricultural subsistence pattern (Newman, 1970Newman J.L. The ecological basis for subsistence change among the Sandawe of Tanzania. National Academy of Sciences, Washington1970Google Scholar). By contrast, the Hadza have a current population size of ∼1,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom still practice a hunter-gatherer lifestyle (Blurton Jones et al., 1992Blurton Jones N.G.

To extend our knowledge of genomic variation in ethnically diverse Africans, we sequenced the genomes of five males from each of three African hunter-gatherer populations (Western Pygmy, Hadza, and Sandawe) at high coverage (Figure 1A). We then compared these genome sequences to a previously published genome sequence from a San hunter-gatherer (Schuster et al., 2010Schuster S.C. Miller W. Ratan A. Tomsho L.P. Giardine B. Kasson L.R. Harris R.S. Petersen D.C. Zhao F. Qi J. et al.Complete Khoisan and Bantu genomes from southern Africa.Nature. 2010; 463: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and to publicly available whole-genome sequence data from other ethnically, linguistically, and geographically diverse African populations (http://www.completegenomics.com/sequence-data/download-data/). Whole-genome sequencing from 15 African hunter-gatherers was performed by Complete Genomics (Drmanac et al., 2010Drmanac R. Sparks A.B. Callow M.J. Halpern A.L. Burns N.L. Kermani B.G. Carnevali P. Nazarenko I. Nilsen G.B. Yeung G. et al.Human genome sequencing using unchained base reads on self-assembling DNA nanoarrays.Science. 2010; 327: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). We obtained ∼60-fold coverage per genome, resulting in high-confidence calls of variants from 95% of each genome (Table 1 and Supplemental Information available online). These genomes were compared to publicly available high-coverage genomes sequenced and analyzed using the same technology and software in a diverse panel of 69 individuals (including 4 Luhya from Kenya, 4 Maasai from Kenya, 10 Yoruba from Nigeria, and 51 non-Africans; Table S1), allowing the genomes of African hunter-gatherers to be placed within a global context.Table 1Summary Statistics for Whole-Genome SequencesStatisticPygmyHadzaSandaweNumber of individuals555Median coverage per genome63.4x ± 3.4×67.3× ± 17.8×61.6× ± 6.2×Called genome fraction94.8% ± 0.7%96.1% ± 0.8%95.1% ± 1.0%Ti/Tv ratio2.16 ± 0.012.14 ± 0.012.16 ± 0.01Variant SNPs per genome3.75 × 106 ± 0.04 × 1063.54 × 106 ± 0.06 × 1063.53 × 106 ± 0.05 × 106Homozygous variant SNP fraction34.04% ± 0.39%37.7% ± 2.7%33.2% ± 0.60%Exonic SNP fraction0.621% ± 0.007%0.612% ± 0.008%0.617% ± 0.011%Insertions1.26 × 105 ± 0.02 × 1051.23 × 105 ± 0.03 × 1051.19 × 105 ± 0.3 × 105Deletions1.49 × 105 ± 0.34 × 1051.43 × 105 ± 0.03 × 1051.39 × 105 ± 0.04 × 105Coding indel fraction0.116% ± 0.003%0.115% ± 0.006%0.118% ± 0.005%Mean values ± one standard deviation are listed for each population.

After applying stringent quality control filters (Supplemental Information and Figure S1), we identified 13,407,517 variants (SNPs, insertions, and deletions that differ from the human genome reference sequence, GRCh37/hg19) in the 15 hunter-gatherer genomes. In addition, we sequenced two Hadza genomes as technical replicates and found ∼28,000 discordant calls per genome pair, corresponding to less than one error per 100 kb, consistent with previous estimates (Drmanac et al., 2010Drmanac R. Sparks A.B. Callow M.J. Halpern A.L. Burns N.L. Kermani B.G. Carnevali P. Nazarenko I. Nilsen G.B. Yeung G. et al.Human genome sequencing using unchained base reads on self-assembling DNA nanoarrays.Science. 2010; 327: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar; Lam et al., 2012Lam H.Y.

Biotechnol. 2012; 30: 78-82Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We also assessed sequence accuracy by comparing calls between whole-genome sequencing and the Illumina1M-Duo BeadChip genotyping array. More than 99.96% of calls were identical between platforms, and a large proportion (>34%) of highly discordant SNPs involved known triallelic loci. The majority of variants are SNPs (90.9%), and we observe a greater number of deletions than insertions relative to the human reference genome (Table 1). We operationally define novel variants as those that are absent from build 131 of dbSNP. A considerable proportion of hunter-gatherer variants are absent from dbSNP 131 (41.1%, or 5,516,366 variants). Cross-referencing with the October 2011 release of the 1000 Genomes Project reveals that 3,062,541 variants remain absent, and thus our sequence data substantially expand the catalog of human genetic variation. Approximately half (50.8%) of the variants that we identify are shared among multiple hunter-gatherer populations, and genomic regions that contain a large number of variants in one population also contain a large number of variants in other populations (Figures 1B and S2). However, despite shared language and geographic proximity, we do not observe an excess of shared variants between Hadza and Sandawe Khoesan speakers, consistent with an ancient divergence and diverse mtDNA haplogroups (Table S2). Of the 13.4 million variants, 3.69 million are intronic, 37,797 are nonsynonymous, and 35,747 are synonymous variants. Moreover, 674,808 variants were located in DNase I footprints (Rosenbloom et al., 2012Rosenbloom K.R. Dreszer T.R. Long J.C. Malladi V.S. Sloan C.A. Raney B.J. Cline M.S. Karolchik D. Barber G.P. Clawson H. et al.ENCODE whole-genome data in the UCSC Genome Browser: update 2012.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: D912-D917Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and 149,072 variants occurred in cis-regulatory motifs within footprints. At the individual level, each hunter-gatherer genome contains ∼11,500 nonsynonymous variants, 12,400 synonymous variants, and 256,000 variants in DNase I footprints. Using PolyPhen-2 classifications (Adzhubei et al., 2010Adzhubei I.A. Schmidt S. Peshkin L. Ramensky V.E. Gerasimova A. Bork P. Kondrashov A.S. Sunyaev S.R. A method and server for predicting damaging missense mutations.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar), we find that ∼60% of amino-acid-changing variants identified in the hunter-gatherer genomes are classified as benign, ∼25% as possibly damaging, and ∼15% as probably damaging. In addition, benign amino acid changes are >2.7 times more likely to be found in all three hunter-gatherer populations than possibly damaging or probably damaging changes (p < 10−10, Z test). Comparing African and non-African genomes, we confirm that non-African populations contain a slight excess in the proportion of probably damaging nonsynonymous variants (Figure S3), consistent with population bottlenecks due to migration out of Africa and with prior studies (Lohmueller et al., 2008Lohmueller K.E. Indap A.R. Schmidt S. Boyko A.R. Hernandez R.D. Hubisz M.J. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. Sunyaev S.R. Nielsen R. et al.Proportionally more deleterious genetic variation in European than in African populations.Nature. 2008; 451: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). By contrast, proportions of synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs and the predicted number of probably damaging sites are similar for African hunter-gatherers and other African populations (Figure S3). Thus, at this broad genomic scale, natural selection appears to shape the genomes of hunter-gatherers similarly to the genomes of other African populations. However, analyses of larger sample sizes will be required to distinguish subtle differences that may exist. The proportion of polymorphic sites, as estimated by θ, are lowest for exons in all three populations, suggesting that natural selection acts on coding sequences to reduce genetic variation (Table 2). θ is lower for introns than intergenic regions, a finding that is consistent with both background selection and positive selective sweeps. In all three hunter-gatherer populations, the mean value of Tajima's D is lower for genic regions. This observation reflects allele frequency distributions that are shifted toward rare alleles in genic regions, a pattern that can be explained by both selective sweeps and purifying selection. Consistent with findings from HapMap Phase II data (Barreiro et al., 2008Barreiro L.B. Laval G. Quach H. Patin E. Quintana-Murci L. Natural selection has driven population differentiation in modern humans.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), we find that mean values of FST, a measure of allele frequency differentiation between populations, are lower for exons and higher for introns and intergenic regions. We also find that 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions have intermediate derived allele frequencies (DAF), θ, Tajima's D, and FST, consistent with evolutionary constraint on regulatory regions. Furthermore, consistent with purifying selection against slightly deleterious mutations, the distribution of derived allele frequencies for exon SNPs are skewed toward low-frequency alleles relative to intergenic SNPs, and the magnitude of this shift was similar for African and non-African populations (Figure S3 and Supplemental Information).Table 2Population Genetic Statistics for Different Types of VariantsStatisticIntergenic10 kb Upstream5′ UTRExonIntron3′ UTR10 kb DownstreamOverallWithin Populationθper base pair (Pygmy)0.0011320.0007830.0007220.0005030.0008600.0008000.0008450.000966θper base pair (Hadza)0.0009210.0006300.0005640.0003900.0006910.0006390.0006810.000782θper base pair (Sandawe)0.0010560.0007280.0006630.0004630.0007970.0007430.0007890.000899Mean DAF (Pygmy)0.27850.27560.27010.25270.27280.26480.27480.2760Mean DAF (Hadza)0.32390.32040.30920.30150.31910.31980.32220.3219Mean DAF (Sandawe)0.29120.28830.27910.27000.28550.28140.28890.2888Tajima's D (Pygmy)−0.4124−0.4350−0.4977−0.5955−0.4411−0.5010−0.4328-0.4272Tajima's D (Hadza)−0.0175−0.0145−0.0347−0.0918−0.0126−0.0300−0.0129-0.0148Tajima's D (Sandawe)−0.3285−0.3587−0.4549−0.5030−0.3627−0.4172−0.3567-0.3453Between PopulationFST (Pygmy, Hadza)0.07270.07230.07130.06810.07270.07140.07220.0726FST (Pygmy, Sandawe)0.04850.04820.04650.04480.04830.04730.04780.0483FST (Hadza, Sandawe)0.06590.06540.06430.06270.06530.06470.06250.0657Statistics are for fully called autosomal variants.

Open table in a new tab Statistics are for fully called autosomal variants. Mean DAF refers to mean derived allele frequency after correcting for CpG hypermutability and biased gene conversion. See also Table S4 and Figures S3, S6, and S5. In addition, we investigated functional constraint for different site types by calculating the neutrality index (NI), which contrasts the levels of polymorphism and divergence of a putatively neutral class of sites to a class of sites that may be subject to selection (Rand and Kann, 1996Rand D.M. Kann L.M. Excess amino acid polymorphism in mitochondrial DNA: contrasts among genes from Drosophila, mice, and humans.Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We used intergenic sites that were at least 50 kb from protein-coding genes as our neutral class and calculated the NI with respect to nonsynonymous, synonymous, intronic, and DNase I footprint sites. Weak purifying selection was found for all of these sites (as defined by a NI significantly greater than 1; Table S4). Strikingly, sites classified as DNase I footprints were more constrained (NI = 1.302, 95% CI = 1.298–1.306) than nonsynonymous sites (NI = 1.153, 95% CI = 1.140–1.167), consistent with the hypothesis that DNase I footprints are enriched for functionally important regulatory variants. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals both continental and population-specific patterns of genetic variation. PC1 distinguishes Africans from non-Africans (with East African populations being closer to non-Africans), and PC2 differentiates Asian and European populations (Figure 1D). The Hadza are differentiated by PC3, and subsequent principal components differentiate Pygmies (PC4) and Sandawe (PC5) from other African populations (Figure S4). To assess shared ancestry between diverse African hunter-gatherer populations, we examined the percentage of shared variants between Pygmy, Hadza, and Sandawe genomes and a previously sequenced San genome (Schuster et al., 2010Schuster S.C. Miller W. Ratan A. Tomsho L.P. Giardine B. Kasson L.R. Harris R.S. Petersen D.C. Zhao F. Qi J. et al.Complete Khoisan and Bantu genomes from southern Africa.Nature. 2010; 463: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The percentage of San variants that are shared with one other hunter-gatherer population is similar for Pygmy-, Hadza-, and Sandawe-specific variants (5.6%–5.7%), suggesting that the San diverged before other hunter-gatherer populations. However, the D test of admixture (Green et al., 2010Green R.E. Krause J. Briggs A.W. Maricic T. Stenzel U. Kircher M. Patterson N. Li H. Zhai W. Fritz M.H. et al.A draft sequence of the Neandertal genome.Science. 2010; 328: 710-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (2469) Google Scholar) indicates that the San genome shares more derived alleles with Pygmies than with the Hadza or Sandawe (p < 0.01; Table S3). This result suggests that the ancestors of the Tanzanian click-speakers (the Hadza and Sandawe) may have diverged more recently in the past than the Pygmy/San split. However, additional possibilities involve gene flow between the ancestors of Pygmies and the San or stochastic loss of shared derived alleles among the ancestors of the Hadza and Sandawe. A neighbor joining tree indicates that Pygmies diverged before the Hadza and Sandawe split (Figure 1F), and lack of monophyly among Pygmy genomes reveals population substructure involving Baka, Bakola, and Bedzan individuals. Hadza and Sandawe genomes are nested within a cluster that also includes the Maasai, possibly due to recent shared gene flow with neighboring East African populations. With the exception of Pygmies, clustering patterns reflect shared language families: Khoesan-speaking Hadza and Sandawe individuals cluster together, as do Niger-Kordofanian-speaking Yoruba and Luhya individuals. We also observe differences in the number and cumulative size of long runs of homozygosity in each population. Of the 15 hunter-gatherer genomes analyzed in this paper, the five genomes with the most runs of homozygosity all belong to the Hadza (Figure S5). Though some of these differences may be due to a population bottleneck in the Hadza (Henn et al., 2011Henn B.M. Gignoux C.R. Jobin M. Granka J.M. Macpherson J.M. Kidd J.M. Rodríguez-Botigué L. Ramachandran S. Hon L. Brisbin A. et al.Hunter-gatherer genomic diversity suggests a southern African origin for modern humans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 5154-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), an additional cause may be cryptic inbreeding (Pemberton et al., 2012Pemberton T.J. Absher D. Feldman M.W. Myers R.M. Rosenberg N.A. Li H. Genomic patterns of homozygosity in worldwide human populations.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.06.014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), as indicated by the large variance in cumulative size of runs of homozygosity within the Hadza (Figure S5). Indeed, cumulative runs of homozygosity in three Hadza genomes are more than double the size of other hunter-gatherers analyzed in this paper (Figure S5). Consistent with an historic bottleneck and/or inbreeding in the Hadza, we find that the proportion of polymorphic sites, as quantified by θ, is lowest for the Hadza and highest for Pygmies (Table 2). Depending on mutation rates, this translates to effective population sizes of 11,300–25,700 (Pygmy), 9,200–20,900 (Hadza), and 10,600–24,000 individuals (Sandawe). Genome-wide estimates of Tajima's D are lower for Pygmies and Sandawe compared to the Hadza (mean values of Tajima's D are −0.4273 for Pygmies, −0.0148 for Hadza, and −0.3453 for Sandawe). These results are consistent with the observation that low-frequency-derived alleles (DAF ≤ 0.1) are overrepresented in Pygmy and Sandawe populations and underrepresented in the Hadza (Figure S6; p < 0.0001, χ2 tests of independence). Together, these results suggest that Pygmy and Sandawe populations have recently expanded in size, whereas the Hadza population has recently decreased in size.

Coupling between the twisted cladding and the core results in dips in the transmission spectrum, which are dependent on the degree of twist introduced into the fiber.

Recent studies indicate that phosphorylated tau might affect synaptic function. We now show that endogenous tau is found at postsynaptic sites where it interacts with the PSD95-NMDA receptor complex. NMDA receptor activation leads to a selective phosphorylation of specific sites in tau, regulating the interaction of tau with Fyn and the PSD95-NMDA receptor complex. Based on our results, we propose that the physiologically occurring phosphorylation of tau could serve as a regulatory mechanism to prevent NMDA receptor overexcitation."
https://openalex.org/W1977728214,"The Sun's equator and the planets' orbital planes are nearly aligned, which is presumably a consequence of their formation from a single spinning gaseous disk. For exoplanetary systems this well-aligned configuration is not guaranteed: dynamical interactions may tilt planetary orbits, or stars may be misaligned with the protoplanetary disk through chaotic accretion , magnetic interactions or torques from neighbouring stars. Indeed, isolated 'hot Jupiters' are often misaligned and even orbiting retrograde. Here we report an analysis of transits of planets over starspots on the Sun-like star Kepler-30 (ref. 8), and show that the orbits of its three planets are aligned with the stellar equator. Furthermore, the orbits are aligned with one another to within a few degrees. This configuration is similar to that of our Solar System, and contrasts with the isolated hot Jupiters. The orderly alignment seen in the Kepler-30 system suggests that high obliquities are confined to systems that experienced disruptive dynamical interactions. Should this be corroborated by observations of other coplanar multi-planet systems, then star-disk misalignments would be ruled out as the explanation for the high obliquities of hot Jupiters, and dynamical interactions would be implicated as the origin of hot Jupiters."

Since then, the specter of ozone depletion in other locations, notably the Arctic, has been identified. Ozone loss is not confined to high latitudes, however, nor is it only the result of the addition of anthropogenic compounds containing chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere, as Anderson et al. (p. 835 , published online 26 July; see the Perspective by Ravishankara ) now demonstrate. Data from the atmosphere above the continental United States revealed that convective injection of water vapor into the stratosphere affects the free radical chemistry involving the (mostly anthropogenic) chlorine and bromine, thus accelerating ozone loss. This process could become important in the stratospheric ozone budget if the frequency and intensity of these water-injection events, which are most common in the summer, increase as a result of global warming."

https://openalex.org/W2017742098,"The visual cortex has the capacity for experience-dependent change, or cortical plasticity, that is retained throughout life. Plasticity is invoked for encoding information during perceptual learning, by internally representing the regularities of the visual environment, which is useful for facilitating intermediate-level vision--contour integration and surface segmentation. The same mechanisms have adaptive value for functional recovery after CNS damage, such as that associated with stroke or neurodegenerative disease. A common feature to plasticity in primary visual cortex (V1) is an association field that links contour elements across the visual field. The circuitry underlying the association field includes a plexus of long-range horizontal connections formed by cortical pyramidal cells. These connections undergo rapid and exuberant sprouting and pruning in response to removal of sensory input, which can account for the topographic reorganization following retinal lesions.

Here, we investigated the spontaneous and induced autophagic behavior of T lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared with that of T lymphocytes from healthy donors by measuring the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II. No significant differences in spontaneous autophagy were found between T lymphocytes from patients with SLE and from healthy donors, apart from CD4(+) naive T cells from patients with SLE in which constitutively higher levels of autophagy (P<0.001) were detected. At variance, whereas treatment of T lymphocytes from healthy donors with serum IgG from patients with SLE resulted in a 2-fold increase in LC3-II levels (P<0.001), T lymphocytes from SLE patients were resistant to autophagic induction and also displayed an up-regulation of genes negatively regulating autophagy, e.g., α-synuclein. These findings could open new perspectives in the search for pathogenetic determinants of SLE progression and in the development of therapeutic strategies aimed to recover T-cell compartment homeostasis by restoring autophagic susceptibility."

When confronted with a visual stimulus, such as an object or a scene, the brain decides whether it is new, and thus deserves to be encoded as a new memory, or old, which triggers the retrieval of the previously encoded memory. When shown a series of stimuli, some of which are similar to, but not identical to, old memories, it becomes necessary to switch back and forth between encoding and retrieval processing. Using behavioral tasks performed by human test subjects, Duncan et al. (p. 485 ) took advantage of the fact that switching takes a second or two and found that a subsequent object, presented before switching has occurred, was more likely to be identified as new when the previous object was new, and identified as old when the previous object was old."

https://openalex.org/W2144901851,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) display altered functioning of cortical networks, including altered patterns of synchronous activity and a serious deficit in cholinergic septohippocampal (SH) innervation. However, the mechanisms underlying these alterations and the implication of the GABAergic SH component in AD are largely unknown. In addition, the GABAergic septohippocampal pathway (SHP) is believed to regulate synchronous hippocampal activity by controlling the activity of interneurons. Here we show, using well-characterized pathway tracing experiments, that innervation of the GABAergic SHP decreases during normal aging. Furthermore, in an AD mouse model (hAPPSw,Ind; J20 mice), the GABAergic SHP shows a dramatic and early onset of this decrease in 8-mo-old mice. This decline is not caused by neuronal loss, but by the reduced number and complexity of GABAergic SH axon terminals. Finally, we demonstrate that hippocampal θ and γ rhythm power spectra are markedly diminished in 8-mo-old behaving mice expressing mutated hAPP. In addition to the well-known loss of cholinergic input to the hippocampus in AD, these data suggest that the altered patterns of synchronous activity seen in patients with AD could be caused by the loss of GABAergic SH axons, which modulate hippocampal network activities.—Rubio, S.

Several components of Notch1 signaling are highly expressed in the adult hippocampus, suggesting the role of this pathway in adult neurogenesis. These discoveries, in addition to our previous findings of reduced neurogenesis in PD models, prompted us to investigate the effects of abnormal α-syn accumulation in a model of mammalian adult neurogenesis. In the present work we report abnormal neuronal differentiation of adult rat hippocampus NPCs (ARH-NPCs) that overexpress α-syn, mediated by a reduction in the expression of Notch1 and its downstream targets Hes1 and Hes5. While investigating the molecular mechanisms responsible for Notch1 down-regulation in ARH-NPCs, we characterized a proximal promoter region of Notch1 that contains conserved elements for p53 binding. We show that p53 binds to these response elements in vivo to repress the transcription driven by the Notch1 promoter. Moreover, we present evidence for the direct binding of α-syn to the DNA and for the interaction of α-syn and p53 proteins, events that contribute to repress Notch1 transcription. The identification of the interactions between p53 and α-syn might shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which α-syn aggregation contributes to the disruption of adult neurogenesis in PD and related synucleopathies. Adult rat hippocampal NPCs (generously provided by Dr. F. Gage, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) were cultured routinely for expansion essentially as described previously (21Ray J. Gage F.H. Differential properties of adult rat and mouse brain-derived neural stem/progenitor cells.Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 560-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) with some modifications (22Crews L. Adame A. Patrick C. Delaney A. Pham E. Rockenstein E. Hansen L. Masliah E. Increased BMP6 levels in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and APP transgenic mice are accompanied by impaired neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 12252-12262Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown for expansion in DMEM/F-12 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) containing B27 supplement, 1× l-glutamine, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). For induction of neuronal differentiation, the cells were plated onto polyornithine/laminin-coated (Sigma-Aldrich) plates or coverslips and transferred the next day to differentiation media containing N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 μm forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% FBS. Except when otherwise stated, the cells were differentiated for 4 days, and fresh differentiation medium was added at day 2. The cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. Vector plasmids were constructed for the production of third generation LV vectors that expressed wild type human α-syn (LV-α-syn), Myc-tagged human α-syn (LV-myc-α-syn), rat siRNA for p53 (LV-si p53), rat siRNA for α-syn (LV-shRNA-α-synuclein), siRNA for luciferase (LV-si Luc), or the empty plasmid backbone as a control (LV-CT/LV-control). The human CMV promoter was used to drive expression of the transgenes. Lentiviral vectors were generated by transient transfection with the vector and packaging plasmids in 293T cells as described previously (23Tiscornia G. Singer O. Verma I.M. Production and purification of lentiviral vectors.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). For delivery of α-syn or the desired siRNAs, the LV system was utilized. The day before infection, 3 × 106 cells were plated on coated dishes in exponential medium. After 1 day, the medium was changed, and the corresponding lentiviral constructs were added to the dishes at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 30 (unless otherwise indicated). The cells were incubated for 24–72 h in a 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Briefly, as described previously (12Winner B. Lie D.C. Rockenstein E. Aigner R. Aigner L. Masliah E. Kuhn H.G. Winkler J.

The cells were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated secondary antibodies directed against mouse, goat, or rabbit. Following rinses in TBS, avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex was applied for 1 h, and then peroxidase detection was performed for 10 min (25 mg/ml diaminobenzidine, 0.01% H2O2, 0.04% NiCl in TBS). Neuronal differentiated ARH-NPCs grown on coverslips were double labeled with polyclonal antibodies against α-syn and Notch1 (1:1000) and detected with the Tyramide Signal AmplificationTM-Direct (Red) system (1:100; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the mouse monoclonal antibodies against tubulin III (Tuj1 clone; 1:100) or p53 (1:500), detected with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:75; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) (24Masliah E.

To confirm the specificity of primary antibodies, control sections were incubated overnight in the absence of primary antibody (deleted) or preimmune serum and primary antibody alone. Real time PCR experiments were performed using the iCycler iQ5 real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) as described previously (25Desplats P.A. Lambert J.R. Thomas E.A.

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and was reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) with 1 μg of total RNA. Amplification was performed on a cDNA amount equivalent to 100 ng of total RNA with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCRs were performed on four independent sets of templates. Specific primers for each studied sequence and for endogenous controls were designed using Oligo perfect software (Invitrogen), and their specificity for binding to the desired sequences was searched against NCBI database (supplemental Table S1). Standard curves were generated for each gene of interest using serial dilutions of cDNAs. Experimental samples and no-template controls were all run in duplicate. The PCR cycling parameters were: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Finally, a dissociation protocol was also performed at the end of each run to verify the presence of a single product with the appropriate melting point temperature for each amplicon. The amount of studied cDNA in each sample was calculated using Bio-Rad software by the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method and expressed as 2exp(Ct) using β-actin as an internal control. For calculations applying the Ct method, the cells infected with empty lentivirus (LV-CT) were used as calibrator samples. After washing with PBS, the cells were harvested and disrupted in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The lysed samples were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, incubated on ice for 20 min, and then cleared by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 2 min) at 4 °C. Lysate protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). For electrophoretic analysis, 4× SDS sample buffer was added to cell lysates. The samples were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Invitrogen). After blocking with 3% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, PBS, the membranes were incubated with gentle agitation overnight at 4 °C with the specific primary antibodies against β-III tubulin (tubulin III, Tuj1 clone, 1:1000; Chemicon), α-syn (1:500; Chemicon), full-length Notch1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz), p53 (1:500; Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA), doublecortin (1:100; Santa Cruz), GFAP (1:500; Chemicon), S100 (1:250; Sigma), or Nestin, PCNA, Hes1, Hes5, anti-Myc, or β-actin (all 1:1000; Chemicon). After washing, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was performed using the VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). RE900 and RE500 DNA fragments were generated by PCR amplification from gDNA extracted from B103 rat neuroblastoma cells using a DNAeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) and using the following primers: RE900F, 5′-ggtgcagtatgaggtcaggg-3′ and RE900R 5′-gaaggggctattaatcaagc-3′; RE500F, 5′-cgagaatagggtggaattcc-3′ and RE500R 5′-caacctccacccttgcttca-3′, under standard PCR conditions and using Faststart Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The EMSA kit (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng of each DNA template were incubated with 2 or 5 μg of human recombinant α-syn (EMD, La Jolla, CA) in 1× binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature prior to electrophoresis through a 6% agarose gel run in 0.5× TBE. DNA was visualized by SYBR® green staining, and detection was performed using the VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). To control for specific binding of α-syn to the DNA, a similar EMSA was run using 100 ng of a double-stranded randomized oligonucleotide with or without preincubation with human α-syn. ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP-Enzymatic Express kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Active Motif) with slight modifications. Briefly, 4.5 × 107 rat neuroblastoma B103 cells were infected with LV-α-syn or LV-CT at MOI 30. After 48 h of incubation, the cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 5 min, repeatedly washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed using a Dounce homogenizer followed by centrifugation. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in enzymatic shearing mixture and digested at 37 °C for 10 min to shear DNA. Ten percent of the mixture of protein-DNA complex was taken for “input DNA” analysis. An equal amount of the protein-DNA complex (7 μg) was then incubated with 2 μg of rat p53 antibody (Active Motif) or 2 μg of human α-syn antibody (Chemicon) and protein G magnetic beads at 4 °C overnight in a rotor. Immunoprecipitated DNA was eluted from protein G beads, cross-linking was reversed, and the DNA was purified. The rat Notch1 promoter region corresponding to bases −1002 and −890, comprising the putative p53 RE900, or the region containing residues −580 to −432 covering RE500 (GenBankTM accession number NM_001105721) were PCR-amplified using the following primers: RE900F, 5′-ggtgcagtatgaggtcaggg-3′; RE900R, 5′-ggcgcaggatttccaaactt-3′; RE500F, 5′-atgcctgcgaacaggtattg-3′; and RE500R, 5′-cgtgggaaaaagcgacagct-3′. In addition, 7 μg of chromatin were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of rat IgG antibody (negative control) or 2 μg of rat RNA polymerase II antibody (positive control), and the eluted DNA was amplified using the Notch1 promoter primers (negative) or β-actin control primers (positive) from a Chip-IT Control kit (Active Motif) (data not shown). The PCR amplification was performed for 35 cycles under standard conditions using the Faststart Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Detection of DNA was performed using the VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). Rat neuroblastoma B103 cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates. The following day the cells were infected with LV-α-syn or LV-CT at MOI 30. 24 h post-infection, the cells were transfected with p53 expression vector (full-length cDNA cloned into pExpress plasmid (Open Biosciences)) and/or reporter plasmids (2 μg of total DNA) containing rat Notch1 promoter fragments NP1002 comprising bases −1002 to +81 (relative to TSS) or NP580 comprising bases −580 to +81, subcloned into pGLuc Basic reporter vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), which contains the “humanized” coding sequence for the secreted Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) without a promoter. Empty pGLuc vector was used as control. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, the cells were analyzed for luciferase activity. For luciferase assays, 25 μl of cell medium containing exported luciferase was incubated with 50 μl of luciferase assay substrate and buffer (New England Biolabs) in 96-well plates. Luciferase was measured at 530 nm in a DTX 880 Multimode Detector (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Assays were performed in triplicate, and luciferase expression was normalized to the number of viable cells (determined in 15,000 cells at the end of the assay by PrestoblueTM cell viability reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions). For the co-immunoprecipitation of interacting proteins, NPC-derived neuronal progeny were infected with LV-Myc-α-syn lentivirus at MOI 30 and treated with 0.5 μg/ml of doxorubicin (G Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) for 24 h to induce p53 expression (26Waldman T.

Aliquots containing 650 μg of protein were brought to a final volume of 500 μl with NET-BSA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% w/v BSA, and 0.02% sodium azide). Homogenates were incubated for 3 h with either 1 μg of rat p53 antibody (Active Motif), 1 μg of human α-syn antibody (Chemicon), or 1 μg of a normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as control, on a rocker at 4 °C. 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose with PBS 50:50 (v/v) was added to the homogenates and incubated overnight on a rocker at 4 °C. Collection of the conjugates was done by centrifuging the samples at 12,000 × g for 30 s and washing pellets for 10 min in a rocker at 4 °C using 1 ml of NET-BSA buffer and finally with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Protein-Sepharose A beads were resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.5, 1× NuPAGE loading buffer (Invitrogen) and 1× reducing reagent (Invitrogen) and heated at 100 °C for 5 min before separation by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. For specific knockdown of p53 expression, we generated a lentiviral construct containing the shRNA directed against rat p53 with the following sequence: 5′-GTACATGTGCAACAGCTCC-3′, subcloned in the p156RRL vector backbone and under the H1 promoter (LV-si p53). Rat neuroblastoma B103 cells and NPC-derived neuronal progeny were infected with LV-si p53 at MOI 30. p53 expression was monitored at 24-h intervals for 4 days post-infection to determine the optimal time point for protein knockdown. At 24 h p53 was reduced to 48% of control cells, and at 48 h the expression was ∼36% of the untreated cells. Because longer incubation did not yield significant reductions on p53 beyond the levels reached at 48 h, that was the time point used in Notch1 expression assays. For specific knockdown of α-syn expression, we generated a lentiviral construct containing the shRNA directed against rat α-syn with the sequence: 5′-GAAGGACCAGATGGGCAAG-3′, subcloned in the pSIH1-copGFP vector backbone under the H1 promoter and containing GFP as reporter (LV-sh-α-synuclein). ARH-NPCs were infected with LV-sh-α-synuclein MOI 30, and α-syn expression as monitored at 24-h intervals for 4 days post-infection by Western blot to determine the optimal time point for protein knockdown (not shown). At 24 h α-syn levels were 70% of control cells, and at 48 h the expression was ∼54% of the untreated cells. Longer incubation times did not yield significant increase in α-syn knockdown; therefore shRNA experiments were conducted 48 h post-infection. Student's t test was used to determine differences in expression of studied genes between control and α-syn-expressing cells. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-tests was used for multiple comparisons, and Student's t test was used for determination of exact p values. All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad software (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA). We have previously reported that accumulation of α-syn results in aberrant neurogenesis in both mouse embryonic stem cells and adult α-syn transgenic mice (14Crews L. Mizuno H. Desplats P.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying adult neurogenesis, we investigated the effects of α-syn overexpression in the neuronal differentiation using an in vitro cell culture model. Cultured ARH-NPCs were infected with lentiviral constructs containing either human α-syn (LV-α-syn) or empty vector (LV-control) and were differentiated into neuronal cells during 8 days (Fig. 1). Significant overexpression of α-syn was evident in the cell body and neurites of LV-α-syn-infected cells, which was accompanied by reduced tubulin expression, shorter neurite length and slight increase of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in the NPC-derived neuronal progeny (Fig. 1, A–E). In addition, α-syn-overexpressing cells showed higher levels of active caspase 3, indicating ongoing apoptosis (Fig. 1, A, B, and F). Taken together, these alterations are suggestive of reduced neuronal differentiation and survival. Detailed analysis of proliferation and maturation markers, as well as markers for neuronal and glial cell types in the NPC-derived progeny at different time points during the neuronal differentiation protocol indicated that at day 4 our in vitro system contains mainly neuronal phenotypes; therefore, we continued the present work with an abbreviated neuronal differentiation protocol of 4 days (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). Notch1 signaling is known to be involved in fate determination and survival of progenitor cells. Because we previously reported that α-syn overexpression decreases Notch1 levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (14Crews L. Mizuno H. Desplats P. Rockenstein E. Adame A. Patrick C. Winner B.

https://openalex.org/W2160301507,"Photoinduced electron transfer in biological systems, especially in proteins, is a highly intriguing matter. Its mechanistic details cannot be addressed by structural data obtained by crystallography alone because this provides only static information on a given redox system. In combination with transient spectroscopy and site-directed manipulation of the protein, however, a dynamic molecular picture of the ET process may be obtained. In BLUF (blue light sensors using FAD) photoreceptors, proton-coupled electron transfer between a tyrosine and the flavin cofactor is the key reaction to switch from a dark-adapted to a light-adapted state, which corresponds to the biological signaling state. Particularly puzzling is the fact that, although the various naturally occurring BLUF domains show little difference in the amino acid composition of the flavin binding pocket, the reaction rates of the forward reaction differ quite largely from a few ps up to several hundred ps. In this study, we modified the redox potential of the flavin/tyrosine redox pair by site-directed mutagenesis close to the flavin C2 carbonyl and fluorination of the tyrosine, respectively. We provide information on how changes in the redox potential of either reaction partner significantly influence photoinduced proton-coupled electron transfer. The altered redox potentials allowed us furthermore to experimentally describe an excited state charge transfer intermediately prior to electron transfer in the BLUF photocycle. Additionally, we show that the electron transfer rate directly correlates with the quantum yield of signaling state formation."
https://openalex.org/W2142060001,"The postentry restriction of HIV-1 replication in monocytes can be relieved when they differentiate to dendritic cells (DCs) or macrophages. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the differentiation-dependent susceptibility of monocytes to HIV-1 infection, and the absence of host-cell-encoded essential factors for HIV-1 completing the life cycle may provide an explanation. We have analyzed the gene expression profile in monocytes by mRNA microarray and compared it with that of differentiated DCs. We demonstrated that purine-rich element binding protein α (Pur-α), a host-cell-encoded ubiquitous, sequence-specific DNA- and RNA-binding protein, showed inadequate expression in monocytes, and the translation of Pur-α mRNA was repressed by cell-expressed microRNA (miRNA). These Pur-α-targeted miRNAs modulated the differentiation-dependent susceptibility of monocytes/DCs to HIV-1 infection, because rescue of Pur-α expression by transfection of miRNA inhibitors relieved the restriction of HIV-1 infection in monocytes, and ectopic input of miRNA mimics significantly reduced HIV-1 infection of monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). Collectively, our data emphasized that inadequate host factors contribute to HIV-1 restriction in monocytes, and cellular miRNAs modulate differentiation-dependent susceptibility of host cells to HIV-1 infection. Elaboration of HIV-1 restriction in host cells facilitates our understanding of viral pathogenesis and the search for a new antiviral strategy.—Shen, C.-J., Jia, Y.-H., Tian, R.-R., Ding, M., Zhang, C., Wang, J.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2039898837,"Mutations of succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the most aggressive and metastatic pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) and paragangliomas (PGLs). Although a variety of missense mutations in the coding sequence of the SDHB gene have been found in PHEOs and PGLs, it has been unclear whether these mutations impair mRNA expression, protein stability, subcellular localization, or intrinsic protein function. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of SDHB mRNA and protein expression from SDHB-related PHEOs and PGLs demonstrated intact mRNA expression but significantly reduced protein expression compared to non-SDHB PHEOs and PGLs. A pulse-chase assay of common SDHB missense mutations in transfected HeLa cell lines demonstrated that the loss of SDHB function was due to a reduction in mutant protein half-life, whereas colocalization of SDHB with mitochondria and immunoprecipitation with SDHA demonstrated intact subcellular localization and complex formation. The half-life of the SDHB protein increased after treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), implicating the protein quality control machinery in the degradation of mutant SDHB protein. These findings provide the first direct mechanism of functional loss resulting from SDHB mutations and suggest that reducing protein degradation with HDACis may serve as a novel therapeutic paradigm for preventing the development of SDHB-related tumors."

Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa convert l-hydroxyproline to α-ketoglutarate via four hypothetical enzymatic steps different from known mammalian pathways, but the molecular background is rather unclear. Here, we identified and characterized for the first time two novel enzymes, d-hydroxyproline dehydrogenase and Δ1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate (Pyr4H2C) deaminase, involved in this hypothetical pathway. These genes were clustered together with genes encoding other catalytic enzymes on the bacterial genomes. d-Hydroxyproline dehydrogenases from P. putida and P. aeruginosa were completely different from known bacterial proline dehydrogenases and showed similar high specificity for substrate (d-hydroxyproline) and some artificial electron acceptor(s). On the other hand, the former is a homomeric enzyme only containing FAD as a prosthetic group, whereas the latter is a novel heterododecameric structure consisting of three different subunits (α4β4γ4), and two FADs, FMN, and [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster were contained in αβγ of the heterotrimeric unit.

Here, we investigated whether the E3 ubiquitin ligase murine double minute-2 (Mdm2) exerts a proangiogenic function in exercised skeletal muscle. Mdm2 hypomorphic (Mdm2Puro/Δ7-9) mice have a 60% reduction in Mdm2 expression compared with that in wild-type animals. Capillary staining on muscle sections from Mdm2Puro/Δ7-9 sedentary mice with a wild-type or knockout background for p53 revealed that deficiency in Mdm2 resulted in 20% capillary regression independently of p53 status. In response to one bout of exercise, protein expression of the proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) was increased by 64% in muscle from wild-type animals, and endothelial cell outgrowth from exercised muscle biopsy samples cultured in a 3-dimensional collagen gel was enhanced by 37%. These proangiogenic responses to exercise were impaired in exercised Mdm2Puro/Δ7-9 mice. Prolonged exercise training resulted in increased Mdm2 protein expression (+49%) and capillarization (+24%) in wild-type muscles. However, exercise training-induced angiogenesis was abolished in Mdm2Puro/Δ7-9 mice. Finally, exercise training restored Mdm2, VEGF-A, and capillarization levels in skeletal muscles from obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats compared with those in healthy animals.

https://openalex.org/W1978924405,"NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductases (NTRs) contain a flavin cofactor and a disulfide as redox-active groups. The catalytic mechanism of standard NTR involves a large conformational change between two configurations. Oxygenic photosynthetic organisms possess a plastid-localized NTR, called NTRC, with a thioredoxin module fused at the C terminus. NTRC is an efficient reductant of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (2-Cys Prxs) and thus is involved in the protection against oxidative stress, among other functions. Although the mechanism of electron transfer of canonical NTRs is well established, it is not yet known in NTRC. By employing stopped-flow spectroscopy, we have carried out a comparative kinetic study of the electron transfer reactions involving NTRC, the truncated NTR module of NTRC, and NTRB, a canonical plant NTR. Whereas the three NTRs maintain the conformational change associated with the reductive cycle of catalysis, NTRC intramolecular electron transfer to the thioredoxin module presents two kinetic components (k(ET) of ~2 and 0.1 s(-1)), indicating the occurrence of additional dynamic motions. Moreover, the dynamic features associated with the electron transfer to the thioredoxin module are altered in the presence of 2-Cys Prx. NTRC shows structural constraints that may locate the thioredoxin module in positions with different efficiencies for electron transfer, the presence of 2-Cys Prx shifting the conformational equilibrium of the thioredoxin module to a specific position, which is not the most efficient."
https://openalex.org/W2007750868,"The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex plays critical roles in checkpoint activation and double-stranded break (DSB) repair. The Rad50 zinc hook domain mediates zinc-dependent intercomplex associations of MRN, which is important for DNA tethering. Studies in yeast suggest that the Rad50 zinc hook domain is essential for MRN functions, but its role in mammalian cells is not clear. We demonstrated that the human Rad50 hook mutants are severely defective in various DNA damage responses including ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) activation, homologous recombination, sensitivity to IR, and activation of the ATR pathway. By using live cell imaging, we observed that the Rad50 hook mutants fail to be recruited to chromosomal DSBs, suggesting a novel mechanism underlying the severe defects observed for the Rad50 hook mutants. In vitro analysis showed that Zn(2+) promotes wild type but not the hook mutant of MR to bind double-stranded DNA. In vivo, the Rad50 hook mutants are defective in being recruited to chromosomal DSBs in both H2AX-proficient and -deficient cells, suggesting that the Rad50 hook mutants are impaired in direct binding to chromosomal DSB ends. We propose that the Rad50 zinc hook domain is important for the initial binding of MRN to DSBs, leading to ATM activation to phosphorylate H2AX, which recruits more MRN to the DSB-flanking chromosomal regions. Our studies reveal a critical role for the Rad50 zinc hook domain in establishing and maintaining MRN recruitment to chromosomal DSBs and suggest an important mechanism of how the Rad50 zinc hook domain contributes to DNA repair and checkpoint activation."

However, the relationship among its catalytic activity, substrate specificities, and the critical processes of neurodegeneration/axon regeneration is incompletely understood. Here we used a transgenic rescue strategy targeting expression of modified forms of Nna1 to Purkinje cells in pcd mice to determine structure-activity relationships for neuronal survival and in parallel characterized the enzymatic properties of purified recombinant Nna1. The Nna1 subfamily uniquely shares conserved substrate-determining residues with aspartoacylase that, when mutated, cause Canavan disease. Homologous mutations (D1007E and R1078E) inactivate Nna1 in vivo, as does mutation of its catalytic glutamate (E1094A), which implies that metabolism of acidic substrates is essential for neuronal survival. Consistent with reports that Nna1 is a tubulin glutamylase, recombinant Nna1—but not the catalytic mutants—removes glutamate from tubulin. Recombinant Nna1 metabolizes synthetic substrates with 2 or more C-terminal glutamate (but not aspartate) residues (Vmax for 3 glutamates is ~7-fold higher than 2 glutamates although KM is similar). Catalysis is not ATP/GTP dependent, and mutating the ATP/GTP binding site of Nna1 has no effect in vivo.

SAgs deregulate the host immune system after penetrating epithelial barriers such as the vaginal mucosa. In response to TSST-1, human vaginal epithelial cells (HVECs) produce cytokines and undergo morphological changes. The epithelial signaling mechanisms employed by SAgs remain largely unknown and are the focus of the work presented here. Analysis of published microarray data identified a network of genes up-regulated by HVECs in response to TSST-1 that includes the sheddase, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17). Investigation revealed that the ADAM17 proteolytic targets, amphiregulin (AREG), transforming growth factor α (TGFα), syndecan-1 (SDC1), and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), are shed from HVECs in response to TSST-1. TAPI-1 (an ADAM inhibitor) completely abrogates all observed shedding and the production of the cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). Knock-down studies show that ADAM17, but not the closely related ADAM10, is required for AREG, TGFα, and TNFR1 shedding. Both ADAM10 and ADAM17 contribute to SDC1 shedding and IL-8 production by HVECs in response to TSST-1. EGFR signaling is critical for up-regulation of IL-8 at the transcriptional level in response to TSST-1 and is also necessary for AREG, TGFα, and TNFR1 shedding. A model is proposed describing the interactions of TSST-1, ADAMs, and the EGFR that lead to establishment of a proinflammatory positive feedback loop in epithelial cells and demonstrate a role for SAgs in the initial stages of disease."

Ultrastructural and cell extraction studies indicate that substantial amounts of FBPase were in the extracellular fraction (periplasm) during glucose starvation. FBPase levels in the extracellular fraction decreased after glucose re-feeding in wild-type cells. The decline of FBPase in the extracellular fraction was dependent on the SLA1 and ARC18 genes involved in actin polymerization and endocytosis.

Certainly, the mouse pituitary gland appears to be an insulin-sensitive tissue as insulin receptors are present at levels comparable to “classical” insulin-sensitive tissues, such as adipose, liver, and skeletal muscle. Furthermore, there is evidence that pituitary cells continue to be sensitive to insulin, whereas the cells from other peripheral tissues become more resistant from chronic hyperinsulinemia in the obese state (1Luque R.M.

Abnormal GH production in obese patients is characterized by impaired spontaneous secretion as well as a decline in pituitary somatotroph responsiveness to all known pharmacological provocative stimuli. Specifically, GH-producing somatotrophs become significantly hyporesponsive to exogenous secretagogues including growth hormone-releasing hormone, ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) and arginine (8Scacchi M.

Inspection of these sequences reveals an E-box (Enhancer Box), 5′-CCACGTGACC-3′, which includes a palindromic hexanucleotide sequence (underlined) at position −264 to −259, and potential hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) binding sequence (HBS) (17Schödel J.

HIF-1α and -β are members of the basic-helix-loop helix transcription factor family. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α protein is ubiquitinated and subject to continuous proteasomal degradation because it contains an oxygen-dependent degradation domain targeted by a specific HIF-prolyl hydroxylase (HPH1–3 also referred to as PHD1–3). Hypoxia, however, attenuates hydroxylation, and HIF-1α is stabilized. HIF-1α is then able to heterodimerize with its constitutively present HIF-1β partner, and form a functional complex that regulates genes via a specific hypoxia-responsive element (18Huang L.E. Gu J.

Deregulation of HIF-1α predominantly in relation to effects on pancreatic gene expression and β cell function has been linked to the development of type 2 diabetes (23Cheng K. Ho K. Stokes R.

Furthermore, elevated levels of HIF-1α in adipose tissue are postulated as contributing to obesity-related insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. As such, HIF-1 is considered an obesity-related transcription factor complex (24Zhang X. Lam K.S. Ye H. Chung S.K. Zhou M. Wang Y. Xu A.

HIF-1α has also been detected in the pituitary (30Yoshida D. Kim K. Noha M. Teramoto A.

Thus, these properties make HIF-1 a candidate to mediate insulin regulation of hGH1 expression. A difficulty in assessing regulation of endogenous hGH production has been the absence of an appropriate non-tumor pituitary culture system expressing hGH1. We generated transgenic (TG) mice containing a single copy of the intact hGH gene locus including its locus control region (LCR), which includes essential hypersensitive site (HS) regions I, II, III, and V (32Jin Y. Lu S.Y. Fresnoza A. Detillieux K.A. Duckworth M.L. Cattini P.A. Differential placental hormone gene expression during pregnancy in a transgenic mouse containing the human growth hormone/chorionic somatomammotropin locus.Placenta. 2009; 30: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This LCR was shown to confer a site of integration-independent pituitary-specific expression (33Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. The human growth hormone gene is regulated by a multicomponent locus control region.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and pituitary hGH1 expression was confirmed in two-independent hGH/CS-TG mouse lines (32Jin Y. Lu S.Y. Fresnoza A. Detillieux K.A. Duckworth M.L. Cattini P.A. Differential placental hormone gene expression during pregnancy in a transgenic mouse containing the human growth hormone/chorionic somatomammotropin locus.Placenta. 2009; 30: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). More recently we generated primary pituitary cell cultures from these hGH/CS-TG mice and showed that hGH1 is expressed by somatotrophs, as hGH protein co-localized with mouse (m) GH in pituitary tissue and cultures (34Vakili H. Jin Y. Nagy J.I. Cattini P.A. Transgenic mice expressing the human growth hormone gene provide a model system to study human growth hormone synthesis and secretion in non-tumor-derived pituitary cells. Differential effects of dexamethasone and thyroid hormone.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2011; 345: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here we have used these hGH/CS-TG mouse pituitary cell cultures to investigate insulin control of endogenous hGH versus mouse GH gene expression. Our data indicate negative regulation of GH at the RNA level and, in the case of hGH1 but not mGH, a role for HIF-1 and remodeling of the proximal promoter region in this response. These results are discussed in relation to the effects of excess insulin resulting from overeating and obesity on hGH production in vivo. All procedures involving animals, their tissues, and cells conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication 85–23, revised 1996) and were approved by the animal Protocol Management and Review Committee at the University of Manitoba. Primary pituitary cell cultures were generated from anterior pituitary glands harvested from 10 adult male and female (8–10 weeks) TG mice containing the intact hGH gene and LCR in a 171-kb fragment of human chromosome 17 (32Jin Y.

Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (10 IU/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin) and maintained in this medium for 72 h. For insulin treatment, cells were re-fed DMEM supplemented with 1% double charcoal-stripped FBS for 24 h and then treated with 1–200 nm insulin (#I9278, Sigma) for 24 h. Induction of HIF-1α protein levels was pursued by cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2) (C2644, Sigma) treatment in which cells were incubated with 150–500 μm CoCl2 for 5 and/or 24 h. To interfere with HIF-1α DNA binding, cultures were preincubated for 60 min with 10 or 20 nm echinomycin (ALX-380–201, Enzo Life Sciences) or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) before insulin treatment. Similarly, inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) class I, II, or III was done using pretreatment with trichostatin A (300 nm, T1952, Sigma) or nicotinamide (15 mm, N0636, Sigma), respectively, for 60 min. Total RNA extraction and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR (qPCR) using specific primers (Table 1) were done as described previously (34Vakili H. Jin Y. Nagy J.I. Cattini P.A. Transgenic mice expressing the human growth hormone gene provide a model system to study human growth hormone synthesis and secretion in non-tumor-derived pituitary cells.

Minus reverse transcriptase controls were performed using the same PCR primers and thermal cycle conditions as a control for the presence of genomic DNA. Specific amplifications were identified by a single peak in the melting curve and a single band in the final PCR product visualized on an agarose gel. The gene expression level in each sample (absolute quantification) was calculated from the standard curve and normalized to mouse β2 microglobulin expression as appropriate. Tests were normally run in duplicate on three independent samples.TABLE 1Primers used for qPCRRNAPrimer sequencehGHForward, CCTAGAGGAAGGCATCCAAAReverse, GCAGCCCGTAGTTCTTGAGTAGmGHForward, ACGCGCTGCTCAAAAACTATReverse, CACAGGAGAGTGCAGCAGAGGHS-RForward, CTGGACAAAGTCGAGCATCAReverse, CTGCCCATCTGGCTCTACTCVEGFForward, AGCACAGCAGATGTGAATGCReverse, AATGCTTTCTCCGCTCTGAAβ2- MicroglobulinForward, GCTATCCAGAAAACCCCTCAAAReverse, GCGGGTGGAACTGTGTTACG Open table in a new tab Nuclear extraction from cultures was performed using a nuclear extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, catalog no. 54001) (35Aza-Carmona M.

Briefly, after treatment, cells were suspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μm sodium molybdate, and 0.1 mm edta) containing phosphatase inhibitors and incubated on ice for 15 min. Detergent (Nonidet P-40) was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and incubation was continued for 15 min. Nuclei were separated by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C), and the nuclear pellet was next extracted in a hypertonic lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the supernatant containing the pure nuclear fraction was collected. Protein concentration was determined by a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For detection of HIF-1α, 25 μg (after CoCl2 treatment) or 100 μg (after insulin treatment) of whole cell protein or nuclear-extracted proteins were analyzed by protein immunoblotting as previously described (36Norquay L.D. Yang X. Jin Y. Detillieux K.A. Cattini P.A. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-3α binding at P sequences of the human growth hormone locus is associated with pituitary repressor function.Mol.

Proteins were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-HIF-1α antibody (NB100–134, Novus Biologicals, Oakville, ON, CA). GAPDH(sc-25778, Santa Cruz), upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF-1; sc-229, Santa Cruz), and/or histone H1 (C-17, Santa Cruz) were assessed as controls for protein loading for whole cell lysates and nuclear proteins, respectively. The proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG) secondary antibody and ECL plus immunoblotting detection reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Nepean, ON, Canada). EMSA and competition with oligonucleotides was performed essentially as previously described (36Norquay L.D. Yang X. Jin Y. Detillieux K.A. Cattini P.A. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-3α binding at P sequences of the human growth hormone locus is associated with pituitary repressor function.Mol.

Briefly, 500 ng of recombinant HIF-1α and 500 ng of HIF-1β were incubated with EMSA buffer containing 2 μg of poly-dIdC for 5 min. Radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes (1 ng) were then added, and the reactions were incubated for a further 10 min at room temperature. In competition experiments, 2.5-, 5-, and 50-fold molar excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotide duplexes were added during a preincubation period. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved in non-denaturing 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. HIF-1α shRNA (sc-35562-V, Santa Cruz) and control/scrambled shRNA lentiviral particles (sc-108080, Santa Cruz) were used for HIF-1α “knock down” as previously reported (37Nam S.Y. Ko Y.S. Jung J.

Briefly, cultures were incubated with DMEM containing lentiviral particles in the presence of Polybrene (5 μg/ml, Santa Cruz) for 24 h. Lentiviral particles were washed away, and cells were incubated for a further 48 h. Medium was then changed to 1% double charcoal-stripped FBS-DMEM for 24 h before treatment with insulin for 24 h, harvesting, and analysis. ChIP assay with cultures treated with or without insulin or CoCl2 were done as previously described (38Yang X. Jin Y. Cattini P.A. Appearance of the pituitary factor Pit-1 increases chromatin remodeling at hypersensitive site III in the human GH locus.J. Mol.

In brief, cells were harvested 24 h after insulin or CoCl2 treatments in cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde before lysis. Chromatin was fragmented by sonication (100 s in 10-s pulses), then insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the DNA content was measured by spectrophotometry. Soluble chromatin was precleared for 1 h and then immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals), HIF-1α (Santa Cruz, sc-10790), or histone H3-H4 hyperacetylation antibodies (Catalog # 06-598 and 06-599, Millipore) overnight at 4 °C as well as with normal rabbit IgG (Millipore) as a negative control. Protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz) was added to immunoprecipitation reaction with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C to collect antibody-chromatin complexes. The agarose-antibody complexes were subjected to a series of washes and elution. The eluted antibody complexes were reverse-cross-linked at 65 °C overnight, and DNA was isolated using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Quantitative PCR was performed in a 7500 Fast Real Time CR system (AB Applied Biosystems) under conditions standardized for each primer set (Table 2). Each qPCR reaction was carried out in duplicat"

Herein, we generated mice deficient in SLIP-GC and examined the impact of SLIP-GC deficiency in immunoglobulin hypermutation and class switch recombination, both AID-dependent mechanisms. SLIP-GC-deficient mice experienced a substantial increase in mutations at G:C base pairs at the region downstream of JH4 in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. This change was reflected in the overall mutation frequency, and it was associated with an increase in transitions from G:C base pairs, a hallmark of AID-mediated deamination during replication. In addition, G:C transitions at non-immunoglobulin loci also increased in these mice. Given the intracellular localization of SLIP-GC to sites of replicating DNA, these results suggest that SLIP-GC protects replicating DNA from AID-mediated deamination of cytosines in both strands.

SHM is coupled to positive selection of B cells that have acquired affinity-enhancing mutations to the foreign antigen, a process known as affinity maturation. Affinity maturation of B cells during immune responses leads to the formation of memory B cells that contribute significantly to a swift, high-affinity memory B cell response upon re-exposure to antigen (4Clarke S.H.

SHM is triggered by the activation-induced deaminase (AID), a cytosine deaminase. AID is expressed in activated B lymphocytes, and it deaminates cytosines in the DNA encoding the IgV regions, the gene segments encoding the antigen-interacting portions of antibodies (5Muramatsu M.

Because of the potential to generate mutagenic DNA lesions, several layers of negative regulation for AID have evolved (13Muto T. Okazaki I.M. Yamada S. Tanaka Y. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Nagaoka H. Honjo T. Negative regulation of activation-induced cytidine deaminase in B cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2752-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

However, the targeting mechanism of AID to IgV and switch regions remains elusive. Although no region in the genome of activated B cells mutates to the level of IgV regions, the mechanism is leaky, and AID sometimes deaminates cytosines in actively transcribed non-Ig genes (21Liu M. Duke J.L. Richter D.J. Vinuesa C.G. Goodnow C.C. Kleinstein S.H. Schatz D.G. Two levels of protection for the B cell genome during somatic hypermutation.Nature. 2008; 451: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). When this involves tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes, untargeted AID activity can lead to the development of B cell lymphomas (22Pasqualucci L. Bhagat G. Jankovic M. Compagno M. Smith P.

Clearly, although AID is critical to memory B cell immune responses, it is also a dangerous molecule that is normally carefully regulated. We have recently characterized a novel GC-expressed protein, SLIP-GC (speckled-like pattern in the germinal center), which appears to protect B cell lymphoma lines from AID-dependent DNA breaks by blocking access of AID to replicating DNA (30Richter K. Brar S. Ray M. Pisitkun P. Bolland S. Verkoczy L. Diaz M. Speckled-like pattern in the germinal center (SLIP-GC), a nuclear GTPase expressed in activation-induced deaminase-expressing lymphomas and germinal center B cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30652-30661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These results lead to the hypothesis that SLIP-GC contributes to the negative regulation of AID-mediated deamination of cytosines in GC B cells. To test this, we generated SLIP-GC-deficient mice and examined Ig hypermutation in Peyer's patches (PP) B cells of young and old mice. We also examined hypermutation in non-Ig genes known to mutate by AID at very low frequencies. The results show that SLIP-GC deficiency causes an increase in G:C transitions at Ig and non-Ig loci that is AID-dependent and strongly suggest a role for this novel protein as a negative regulator of AID activity in GC B cells. A vector was generated containing loxP sites flanking exons 2 and 4 of the Slip-GC gene. Exon 2 harbors the conserved GTPase domain of SLIP-GC (30Richter K. Brar S. Ray M. Pisitkun P. Bolland S. Verkoczy L. Diaz M. Speckled-like pattern in the germinal center (SLIP-GC), a nuclear GTPase expressed in activation-induced deaminase-expressing lymphomas and germinal center B cells.J. Biol.

Vector was transfected into C57BL6 ES cells, and germline transmission was obtained. Initially, mice were crossed to Sox2 promoter-driven Cre-recombinase transgenics, which are in a mixed genetic background. Cre-recombinase heterozygous, Slip-GC homozygous floxed mice were backcrossed into Slip-GC homozygous floxed mice in a pure C57BL/6J background for at least six generations to generate Sox2-cre heterozygous, Slip-GC floxed homozygous mice in the C57BL/6J background (supplemental Fig. 1). To confirm wild type (WT), heterozygote, or homozygote for the floxed gene or Slip-GC-deficient (Slip-GC−/−cre+) genotypes, PCR was performed with three primers: SlipGC 5flox forward, 5′-GAA ATG ACT GGG GTG TTC TGA GGC-3′; GCSP, 5′ Flox reverse (N16ck5R), 5′-GTG CCC GCT TAC CAC AGA ACT TATG-3′, and GCSP 3′ Flox reverse (N16del3R2), 5′-GAT ACG TTT GGT GCC AGC ATT CAT C-3′. The WT allele results in a 0.55-kb PCR product, where the Slip-GC mutated allele results in a 0.68-kb PCR-product. Mice used in these studies were 6–24 weeks of age. All the mice were housed in the animal facility at the NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, under specific-pathogen-free conditions, and animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA (20 μl) was synthesized with 1 μg of total RNA as template using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis supermix (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression levels of AID and Slip-GC were estimated using real-time PCR. The RT-PCR primers were synthesized by Invitrogen: mAID forward, 5′-GGA GAC CGA TAT GGA CAG CCT TCT G-3′; mAID reverse, 5′-TCA AAA TCC CAA CAT ACG AAA TGC-3′; Slip-GC mice exon 2, forward 5′ GAG TGT CGG ACC AGG AGG GTC T-3′; and Slip-GC mice exon 3 reverse, 5′-CAG GGC CAT AGA GCA TCC GTA G-3′. PCR reactions were performed in 50-μl volumes containing 2 μl of cDNA sample, 1× PCR buffer, 10 mm/liter deoxynucleotide triphosphates mix (dNTPs), 2 mm/liter each sense and antisense primers, and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). After an initial 3-min incubation at 95 °C, 36 PCR cycles were carried out using the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 57 °C (Slip-GC) and 52 °C (AID) for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. To verify that equal amounts of cDNA were added to each PCR reaction, we used the housekeeping gene GAPDH (mGAPDH forward primer 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′ and mGAPDH reverse primer 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′; annealing temperature 52 °C, 27 cycles). PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and analyzed. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 μl of 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl chicken gamma globulin (TNP(24)-CGG) (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA) at three different sites. Mice were sacrificed, and spleens were taken 5, 7, and 10 days after immunization with TNP(24)-CGG (Biosearch Technologies) and fixed quickly in optimum cutting temperature compound (O.C.T. Sakura Finetechnical) using dry ice. Frozen, O.C.T.-embedded tissues were cryosectioned and fixed with Rapid-Fixx fixative (Richard-Allen Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) for 7 s, and endogenous peroxide was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide. Protein blocking was done with the avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Primary antibody, peanut agglutinin (Vector Laboratories), diluted with 1 mm CaCl2, and MgCl2, MnCl2, was incubated for 60 min at a 1:1000 dilution. Slides were developed with diaminobenzidine, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, and coverslipped. PP were collected from mice at 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks of age, and single-cell suspensions were made by squashing Peyer's patches between two frosted slides. After washing in buffer (PBS, 0.1% sodium azide, 1/100 l-glutamine), cells were stained with conjugated antibodies: phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-B220 (0.2 μg per 106 cells), phycoerythrin-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD19 (0.2 μg per 106 cells), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-GL7 (0.5 μg per 106 cells) (BD Biosciences). B220+ CD19+ GL7+ cells were sorted using a BD Biosciences FACSVantage SE flow cytometer. The IgH variable region DNA was amplified by PCR. Briefly, for the IgH locus, a 1.2-kb fragment from the intronic region 3′ of the rearranged endogenous VH genes was amplified using a primer VHJ558 forward (GCC TGA CAT CTG AGG ACT CTG C) along with a primer IgH intronic enhancer reverse (CCT CTC CAG TTT CGG CTG AAT CC) with Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The PCR was performed at 98 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 70 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s; and 72 °C for 6 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel (SeaKem® LE agarose, Lonza Rockland, Rockland, ME). A bright 1.2-kb band was excised and purified using a QIAquick® gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The 1.2-kb DNA fragments were cloned using a TOPO TA Cloning® pCR®2.1-TOPO® kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Shot® Top10 chemically competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) were transformed with the TOPO vector, spread on Luria-Bertani broth (LB) agar (ampicillin 100 μg/ml) plates, which had been spread with 2% X-gal and 0.1 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Plasmid DNA was prepared from positive white clones, and the inserted VH 1.2-kb PCR fragments were sequenced with a primer specific to the region immediately downstream of JH4 (TAT GCT ATG GAC TAC TGG) or M13 forward (−20) primer (GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA G) and M13 reverse primer (CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC). Seven B6 control and five Slip-GC-deficient mice, which were 4 months of age, were used for this analysis. Positive germinal center Peyer's patch B cells were isolated by FACS after staining with conjugated antibodies: phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-B220, phycoerythrin-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD19, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-GL7. Genomic DNA was isolated as described above. The following primers were used to amplify specific genes from the mouse genome by PCR followed by analyzing by sequencing: CD79B0010 forward (GAG CCT GGT GTG AGT ATG TCT CC; binding at Chr11: 106,174,649 bp), CD79B0020 forward (AGA AAC ACT GGC TGT CCC TAG AA; binding at Chr11: 106,175,058 bp), CD79B0021 reverse (ACA TTC CCA GAG CTA CTT CCT CC; binding at Chr11: 106,176,049 bp), CD79B0030 forward (CTC TCA TTT CCA CAG AAG CAA CA; binding at Chr11: 106,175,873 bp), CD79B0031 reverse (AAA GGT CGA ATC CTT AGC CTG TC; binding at Chr11: 106,176,546 bp), CD83M0010 forward (TCC CTT GCT CAA ACA ACG TAA AC; binding at Chr13: 43,880,113 bp); CD83M0011 reverse (AGG CTG CAG GCT ACA AGA GAG AG; binding at Chr13: 43,880,725 bp), CD83M0020 forward (CTC CAG CTC CTG TTT CTA GGC T; binding at Chr13: 43,880,596 bp), CD83M0020 forward (CTC CAG CTC CTG TTT CTA GGC T; binding at Chr13: 43,880,596 bp), CD83M0021 reverse (CAC CTG AGA CCC TCT TTG AGA TG; binding at Chr13: 43,881,221 bp), CD83M0030 forward (AAG GGA TTG GAT CCA TGT TAC AG, binding at Chr13: 43,881,059 bp), CD83M0031 reverse (AGA GCA TAC AGA GGC TTC CTC CT; binding at Chr13: 43,881,679 bp), CD83M0040 forward (AAG GTT TCC TTT CAG TGA GAG CC; binding at Chr13: 43,881,449 bp), and CD83M0041 reverse (CAT GGT ATC ACC TCC TTC CTG AC; binding at Chr13: 43,882,052 bp). PCR conditions for Cd79b were 98 °C for 3 min; 36 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 64 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 40 s; and 72 °C for 6 min. PCR conditions for Cd83 were: hot start, using 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 98 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 64 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 40 s; and 72 °C for 6 min. PCR products (Cd79b 1897 bp and Cd83 1939 bp) were purified using a QIAquick® gel extraction kit according to the manual. After adding A overhangs to their blunt ends, PCR products were cloned into pCR®2.1-TOPO vector, transformed into One Shot® Top10 chemically competent E. coli, and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h on LB ampicillin plates, which had been spread with 2% X-gal and 0.1 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. For each gene, 96 or more clones were analyzed. The total sequence analyzed for both genes was 800–1150 bp in both directions beginning at or near the transcriptional start site. Cycle sequencing reactions were performed at 1/64 BigDye reaction scale (BigDye Terminator version v1.1, Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA). PCR reactions were performed on the MJ Tetrad 225 (Bio-Rad). Liquid handling for the cycle sequencing protocol was automated on the BioMek FX robot (Beckman Coulter) using a magnetic bead based purification system (Agencourt Bioscience). Bead-cleaned cycle sequencing reactions were run on 48 capillary ABI 3730 sequencers (Applied Biosystems). Sequence data files were uploaded on a Linux server into the Phred/Phrap/Consed/PolyPhred suite of tools (Nickerson et al. (33Nickerson D.A. Tobe V.O. Taylor S.L. PolyPhred: automating the detection and genotyping of single nucleotide substitutions using fluorescence-based resequencing.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar)) for quality analysis and polymorphism detection. Trace file analyses were conducted by Phred/Phrap (31Ewing B. Green P. Base-calling of automated sequencer traces using Phred. II.

The interface to view trace file and SNP detection analysis results was Consed (34Gordon D. Abajian C. Green P. Consed: a graphical tool for sequence finishing.Genome Res. 1998; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar). Resting/naive splenic B cells were isolated by using CD43 (Ly-48) MicroBeads following the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotech GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Ammonium chloride-potassium lysing buffer (0.15 mm NH4Cl, 10.0 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.4) was used to eliminate red blood cells. Cd43-isolated B cells were incubated at 1 × 106 cells/ml in complete B cell culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, all from Invitrogen) and stimulated in vitro with or without LPS (LPS; 50 μg/ml), LPS + IL-4 (LPS; 50 μg/ml and IL-4; 20 ng/ml), or LPS + IFN-γ (LPS; 50 μg/ml and mIFN-γ; 20 ng/ml) for 96 h. LPS was from Sigma, and cytokines were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). To detect mouse IgM, total IgG, IgG3, IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgA supernatant was collected, diluted (IgG3 (1:4), IgG1 (1:2), IgG2c (no dilution)), and analyzed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. Bone marrow cells from two mice of age 6 and 8 weeks were prepared by flushing femurs or, in some experiments, both femurs and tibias with FACS buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 3% FCS (Sigma) and 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen)) using a syringe and a 23-gauge needle. The cells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm (319 × g) for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was gently resuspended in FACS buffer and centrifuged as described above. Finally, after resuspending the pellet in FACS buffer, the cells were filtered through 30-μm nylon mesh or, if subsequently being used in tissue culture, 40-μm sterile nylon filters (BD Falcon). Viable, nucleated cells were counted using a 0.4% aqueous trypan blue solution (Sigma) exclusion and adjusted to the appropriate concentration. Spleen cell suspensions were prepared by gently squeezing pieces of spleen between two microscope slides with frosted ends in the presence of FACS buffer. Cells were filtered through a 40-μm sterile nylon filter, washed twice in FACS buffer (centrifugation as described above), and finally resuspended in FACS buffer. 0.5 × 106 cells of either cell solution were stained in alternate wells of a round-bottomed 96-well plate (Nunc) with the following antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled rat anti-mouse-B220/CD45R (clone RA3-6B2); phycoerythrin-labeled rat anti-mouse-B220/CD45R (clone RA3-6B2), IgM (cloneR6-60.2), CD25/IL-2Rα-chain (clone Pc61), CD117/c-Kit (clone ack45) and CD19 (1D3); allophycocyanin-labeled rat anti-mouse B220/CD45R (clone RA3-6B2); and biotinylated rat anti-mouse Ig λ1, λ2, and λ3 light chain (clone R26-46) (Pharmingen). Allophycocyanin-labeled anti-mouse Ly-77 (clone GL7) was from eBioscience. Biotinylated antibodies were revealed using streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Southern Biotechnology Associates), streptavidin-allophycocyanin (Pharmingen), or streptavidin TRI-COLOR (Caltag Laboratories). After centrifugation (1200 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C), the cells were resuspended and incubated (25 μl final volume) with the appropriate combinations of the above antibodies at optimal dilutions in FACS buffer on ice for 30 min in the dark. The cells were washed and, when necessary, biotinylated antibodies were revealed by incubation for a further 15 min on ice with streptavidin conjugated with appropriate fluorochrome. The cells were resuspended in FACS buffer and analyzed with a FACSCaliburTM with Consort 30 software (Becton Dickinson) equipped with the appropriate filters for four-color immunofluorescence. Dead cells were visualized by adding propidium iodide (0.25 μg/ml final concentration (Sigma) prior to acquisition. Typically, 10,000 live, nucleated events were collected. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Ashland, OR). Fisher's exact test was used to compare mutation frequencies. One-sided p values were used when the direction of the difference could be predicted a priori; otherwise, two-"
