https://openalex.org/W1996876777,"Somatostatin, a hypothalamic peptide that inhibits the secretion of pituitary growth hormone, inhibits basal insulin secretion in fasted cats and rats. In fasted baboons both basal and arginine-stimulated secretion of insulin and glucagon are inhibited. Somatostatin appears to act directly on the endocrine pancreas. The action is dose-related, rapid in onset, and readily reversed."

https://openalex.org/W2027766264,"A new term, autogenous regulation, is used to describe a phenomenon that is not a new discovery but rather is newly appreciated as a mechanism common to a number of systems in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In this mechanism the product of a structural gene regulates expression of the operon in which that structural gene resides. In many (perhaps all) cases, the regulatory gene product has several functions, since it may act not only as a regulatory protein but also as an enzyme, structural protein, or antibody, for example. In a few cases, this protein is the multimeric allosteric enzyme that catalyzes the first step of a metabolic pathway, gearing together the two most important mechanisms for controlling the biosynthesis of metabolites in bacterial cells—feedback inhibition and repression. Autogenous regulation may provide a mechanism for amplification of gene expression; for severe and prolonged inactivation of gene expression; for buffering the response of structural genes to changes in the environment; and for maintaining a constant intracellular concentration of a protein, independent of cell size or growth rate. Thus, autogenous regulation provides the cell with means for accomplishing a number of different regulatory tasks, each suited to better satisfying the needs of the organism for its survival."
https://openalex.org/W2154329174,"Rat brain tubulin is composed of two electrophoretically distinguishable subunits. The state of the protein sulfhydryl groups affects the electrophoretic mobility of these subunits on sodium dodecyl sulfate or sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea polyacrylamide gels, so it is not possible to determine whether the subunits differ in size or charge by these techniques. The complete amino acid composition of rat brain tubulin is presented and the ultraviolet absorption spectra of tubulin in guanidine HCl and in sodium dodecyl sulfate are shown. All the half-cystine residues of tubulin are present as free sulfhydryl groups and are titrated with 4,4′-dithiopyridine with a half-time of about 2 min. The NH2-terminal residue of both chains of rat brain tubulin is methionine. Tryptic maps of tubulin (equimolar mixture of the α and β chains) suggest that the two chains are very similar, but interpretation of the maps is complicated by the fact that the tryptic digestion is only 80% complete and that there is a significant amount of acid insoluble material. Electrophoresis of both tryptic and peptic digests of in vivo 32P-tubulin indicate that there is a single 32P-labeled peptide. The 32P-labeled tryptic peptide was purified from adult in vivo 32P-tubulin; it is approximately 50 to 52 amino acids long and contains 20% of the aspartic and glutamic residues and 2% of the basic residues of the entire β chain."

https://openalex.org/W1984195294,"An enzyme that catalyzes the formation of specific pseudouridine residues in the anticodon region of tRNA has been characterized in extracts of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. It has previously been shown that hisT regulatory mutants of S. typhimurium lack the pseudouridine modifications in the anticodon region of histidine and several other tRNA species. This has permitted the development of a simple radiochemical assay for the modification enzyme, based on the release of tritium from hisT tRNA isolated from cells grown in [5-3H]uridine. This enzyme activity is absent from hisT mutants and is relatively heat-labile in extracts from temperature-sensitive hisT mutants, which suggests that the modification enzyme itself is the primary gene product of the hisT gene."

A total of 988 grams of lepromas containing an estimated 15 to 20 grams of leprosy bacilli has been harvested from these animals. The large amounts of material now available will permit in-depth studies of the biochemistry and metabolism of the leprosy bacillus, and the animal model should make possible definitive studies on the immunology, chemotherapy, and epidemiology of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W1503451592,"Abstract Initial rate studies were employed to investigate the kinetic mechanism of action of rat skeletal muscle type II hexokinase (EC 3.7.1.1). These investigations involved the use of substrate analogs which act as competitive inhibitors and product inhibition experiments. The findings indicate that substrates d-glucose and MgATP2- add randomly to hexokinase. Both products exhibit noncompetitive inhibition relative to either substrate. The kinetic results are compatible with a Random Bi Bi mechanism of either the rapid equilibrium or the steady state type. The kinetic data are qualitatively identical with those obtained for yeast hexokinase. Although muscle hexokinase does not respond as predicted to the model of adenylate energy charge, it is potently inhibited by levels of glucose-6-P and orthophosphate thought to exist in muscle tissue. The enzyme is inhibited 79% at the approximate intracellular concentrations of substrates, products, and phosphate. This inhibition is increased to 96% when the concentration of these compounds rises to those levels believed to exist during tetanic muscular contraction. The data suggest that the muscle type II hexokinase is not functional during periods of highly active glycogenolysis and glycolysis in rat muscle tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2038902889,"A sudden enhancement in virulence of a mild Plasmodium berghei yoelii 17 x strain resulted in fulminating and fatal infections in CF1 and A/J mice. The virulent strain has maintained its characteristics after ten cyclical transmissions through Anopheles stephensi. The visible expression of virulence of the mutated strain is its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause intravascular sequestration of injected erythrocytes and blockage of brain capillaries. We, therefore, believe that the virulent line of Plasmodium berghei yoelii 17 x could serve as a useful laboratory model for the study of ""cerebral malaria."""

https://openalex.org/W1480298024,"When Escherichia coli galactose-1-P uridylyltransferase is permitted to react with [uracil-5,6-3H]UDP-glucose for a short time and is then reisolated by gel filtration, the protein contains a substantial amount of radioactivity. The tritiated protein appears to be a uridylyl-enzyme intermediate as indicated by the following. (a) When [uracil5,6-3H]UDP-glucose is replaced by UDP-[U-14C]glucose, no radioactivity can be detected in the protein. (b) When [uracil-5,6-3H]UDP-glucose is supplemented with an equal concentration of glucose-1-P the amount of radioactivity in the protein is substantially decreased. (c) When the tritiated enzyme reacts with galactose-1-P all of the radioactivity is removed. The isolation of two half-reactions suggests that the uridylyl-enzyme is a component of a double displacement pathway. In further substantiation of this, the enzyme catalyzes both the exchange of uridylyl moieties between UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose in the absence of added hexose-1-P and the exchange of 14C between UDP-[U-14C]-glucose and glucose-1-P in the absence of added galactose-1-P. In all these respects the pathway contrasts sharply with that reported for the metabolically and chemically related UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1576284445,"Abstract The arginyl and valyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetases (EC 6.1.13 and EC 6.1.1.9, respectively) in various strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium were measured over a wide range of steady state growth rates. Both enzymes were found to increase approximately 2.5-fold in specific activity over a 7-fold increase in growth rate. Appropriate tests indicated that this change was not the result of stimulation or inhibition of enzyme activity. Use of antibodies prepared against purified valyl-tRNA synthetase revealed differences in the amount of this enzyme in cell-free extracts of cultures grown at different growth rates. By use of a sequential labeling technique it was possible to demonstrate that the low activity of these two enzymes in extracts from slow growing cultures was not caused by specific degradation. During transitions in growth rates brought about by shifts in media, the activity of each of these enzymes changed similarly to the accumulation of RNA, and not in a manner one would predict for enzymes regulated by amino acid supply. By sequential labeling it was shown that the increased differential rate of activity accumulation seen for these enzymes after a shift up was the result of an increased differential rate of synthesis. The pattern of regulation of the arginyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetases seen in steady state cultures and during growth rate transitions has been termed metabolic regulation. The regulation of these two enzymes is similar under these conditions to that of other members of the bacterial cell's protein synthesizing machinery, and is difficult to reconcile with an amino acid mediated repression of these enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2124853162,Abstract d-Asparagine prevents the dissociation of Escherichia colil-asparaginase. Conditions that affect the rate of hydrolysis of the substrate also influence the extent of protection. The most effective stabilization of the tetrameric aggregate is provided between pH 5 and 8 with half-maximal rates of dissociation occurring at pH 4.2 and 8.8. Partial acetylation of tyrosyl residues of l-asparaginase results in modification of behavior of the enzyme towards the protective action of d-asparagine. The results of these studies have provided an indication of the nature of the amino acid residues at the substrate-binding site.
https://openalex.org/W1555510972,"Abstract Procedures have been developed for the preparation of radioiodinated RNA suitable for molecular characterization and hybridization. Incorporation of radioiodine into RNA in a thallic trichloride-catalyzed reaction is strongly pH-dependent. Above neutral pH little uptake of isotope into polynucleotide occurs, although incorporation into protein proceeds rapidly. The initial linkage of iodine incorporated into RNA at pH 5 is unstable and as much as 70% of the iodine originally associated with the polynucleotide can be dissociated by further heating above neutral pH. This behavior can be explained in terms of the reactions of the individual nucleotides. The predominant product formed with uridylate groups during reaction for 10 min at pH 5 is unstable and 95% of the adduct is rapidly released on heating at pH above 6. At lower pH the release is gradual but approaches the same final level of residual stable linkage. Cytidylate also forms an unstable iodine-containing intermediate. However, the initial addition product to polycytidylate was rapidly converted to a stable linkage throughout the pH range tested and underwent the transition even on standing at room temperature at pH 5. Purine groups in polynucleotides react to a lesser extent and composed less than 3% of the total isotope stabilized in RNA. When reactions were carried out under conditions which yield nucleic acid labeled to high specific activity, the iodination of residues in polyguanylate and also nucleotides present in polyadenylic acid was observed. Iodine retained in the respective purine residues after a reisolation procedure which lasted 48 hours was stable to heating at pH 4 to 9. The procedure for radioiodination and purification of the reaction product has been developed to allow experimentation with nucleic acids which are available in only small quantities. The physicochemical characterization of such RNAs or RNA fractions is complicated by the incorporation of iodine into protein, DNA, and other, undefined, contaminants. These substances can be eliminated from high molecular weight RNA by including a filtration step and sedimentation through cesium sulfate in the postlabeling workup of the iodinated RNA. The new procedures decreased the background level in hybridization reactions to 0.01 %. In addition to the base composition of RNA, our results suggest that secondary molecular structure of RNA may be important to the extent of reaction with iodine. This latter factor must be taken into consideration for interpretation of experiments comparing profiles of iodine-labeled nucleic acids. In the same regard, the results show that reaction conditions yielding highly labeled RNA do not cause chain breakages."

https://openalex.org/W1578751920,"Abstract A five-step procedure is described for the purification to homogeneity of initiation factor IF-3 from ribosomal washes of Caulobacter crescentus. The protein, C-IF-3, has a molecular weight of 24,000 to 25,000 and seems to consist of a single polypeptide chain. It has three in vitro activities. (a) It promotes ribosomal binding of N-formyl methionyl transfer RNA directed by phage messengers; (b) it dissociates 70 S ribosomes into 30 S and 50 S subunits; (c) it binds single-stranded natural and synthetic RNAs. The factor is analogous to, and exchangeable with Escherichia coli IF-3. However, E. coli ribosomes do not bind N-formyl methionyl transfer RNA with C. crescentus phage Cb5 RNA as messenger and, conversely, C. crescentus ribosomes do not form an initiation complex with coliphage MS2 RNA or late T4 RNA. C-IF-3, as well as E. coli IF-3, have a high affinity for single-stranded stacked polymers, e.g. polyadenylate. Deviation from this type of structure, whether toward a more organized one, e.g. polyadenylate·polyuridylate, transfer RNA, or toward unstacking, e.g. polyuridylate, has an adverse effect on binding. DNA, native and denatured, is not bound at C-IF-3 concentrations sufficient to bind polyribonucleotides. Binding of C-IF-3 to coliphage MS2 RNA provides some protection from degradation by RNase."

https://openalex.org/W1537303048,"Abstract The steady state kinetic data of yeast glyoxalase I have been re-examined. Extension of the concentration ranges of the reactants reveal nonlinearities in v versus v/[A] and Dixon plots, which necessitate revision of a previous kinetic model (Bartfai, T., Ekwall, K., and Mannervik, B. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 387–391). The selection of the best mathematical model has been based on nonlinear regression methods and the results of inhibition studies involving S-substituted glutathione derivatives. A mechanism is proposed, which exhibits the unusual feature of alternative one- and two-substrate branches, the latter involving glutathione and methylglyoxal as the first and second substrates, and the former having their hemimercaptal adduct as the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1570407057,"Treatment of the cell envelope of a colicin I-sensitive strain of Escherichia coli with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 solubilizes an envelope component which forms a complex with 125I-colicin Ia and Ib. A similar component could not be shown in a strain known to be lacking active colicin I receptors. On this basis, this component is assumed to be the colicin I receptor. The colicin I receptor was found to be sensitive to trypsin, but insensitive to DNase, RNase, periodate, and phospholipases. Its capacity to bind colicin I was inhibited by salt. Sedimentation analysis in 5 to 20% sucrose gradients containing 0.05% Triton X-100 revealed that the colicin Iareceptor complex has a sedimentation constant of 12.4 S. Based on its behavior in gel filtration on Sepharose 6B columns containing detergent, the complex was shown to have a Stokes radius of 73.5 A. On the basis of these experiments, the colicin I-receptor complex has a molecular weight of 387,000 and a frictional ratio of about 1.5 and an axial ratio of about 8 or 9 for prolate or oblate ellipsoids, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1483021767,"Abstract Each of the four Ascaris pepsin inhibitors forms a stoichiometric complex with porcine pepsin between pH 2 and 5 with an apparent dissociation constant, Ki, of 10-10 m, when free pepsin was determined with hemoglobin, or 9.1 x 10-10 m when free pepsin was determined with N-acetyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-diiodotyrosine. Each inhibitor forms a stoichiometric complex with human pepsin and with porcine gastricsin with dissociation constants for the complexes of the order of 10-9 m but does not react with human gastricsin. All of the inhibitors delayed milk-clotting activity of porcine pepsin at pH 5.3. The pepsin-inhibitor complex forms between pH 2 and 5 in less than 20 s and is completely dissociated in 30 min at pH 8.8 and 37°. The fully active inhibitor is recovered at low pH, but pepsin is denatured. No evidence could be obtained to suggest that the inhibition of pepsin by these Ascaris inhibitors is a recognizable case of temporary inhibition."

It has a molecular weight of approximately 50,000 and has been shown to be antigenically different from EF-Ts and EF-G and to be free of known EF-Tu activities. A temperature-sensitive mutant, defective in the translocase G, contains an unaltered X strengthening the argument that X differs from G. The activity of X appears restricted to certain messenger RNAs. It functions by extending dipeptidyl tRNAs on ribosomes and may therefore participate in the translocation of mRNA. The possible function of X in events preceding translocation is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1578962817,"Abstract Two subspecies of initiation factor IF-2 have been isolated from ribosomal washes of Caulobacter crescentus and purified to homogeneity. Both factors, C-IF-2a and b, have the same functional properties and are interchangeable with Escherichia coli IF-2 for the formation of initiation complexes with either E. coli or C. crescentus ribosomes. The C. crescentus ribosomal wash contains no detectable IF-1 activity and the formation of initiation complexes with C. crescentus ribosomes has no requirement for added IF-1. With E. coli ribosomes C-IF-2a or b, or the crude C. crescentus ribosomal wash, must be supplemented with E. coli IF-1 for optimum initiation complex formation. IF-1 activity resides in C. crescentus salt-washed 30 S subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1486780842,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Salmonella typhimurium is shown to consist of four subunits of molecular weight about 100,000. Guanidinium chloride and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate only partially dissociate the carboxymethylated subunits into monomers of molecular weight of about 50,000. Only one NH2-terminal residue, methionine, is found by the dansylation procedure, which together with peptide mapping results suggests that the enzyme is made up of identical subunits. The enzyme binds 4 moles of l-aspartate and 4 moles of acetyl coenzyme A, i.e. each subunit, although it seems to be made up of two monomers, carries only one binding site for each one of these ligands. The binding of aspartate in the absence of allosteric activators (acetyl-CoA, guanosine triphosphate, and fructose diphosphate), or with the activators present singly, is hyperbolic. The dissociation constant of aspartate is 0.09 mm, but this value varies between 0.1 mm and 0.25 mm in the presence of the various activators. When two activators are present simultaneously, not only does the binding curve for aspartate become sigmoidal but the dissociation constant increases drastically. The dissociation constant for aspartate, for instance, in the presence of acetyl-CoA and fructose diphosphate together is about 1.5 mm. The binding of acetyl-CoA to the enzyme, in contrast to aspartate, is sigmoidal at low concentrations, but the binding curve shows at higher concentration of this activator. A likely cause of this tailing is that acetyl-CoA binds nonspecifically at higher concentrations to some other site on the enzyme surface. In the presence of a second activator, such as GTP, the binding curve for acetyl-CoA becomes hyperbolic and the dissociation constant for this ligand is considerably reduced. Neither magnesium nor manganese is required for the binding of the various ligands on the enzyme surface. The equilibrium binding results are interpreted on the basis of a two-state model, where the enzyme in the absence of any ligands is assumed to be present predominantly in a state which binds the inhibitor, aspartate, preferentially. The cooperative interaction of activators results in changing the conformation of the protein to a low affinity state for aspartate."

https://openalex.org/W1575564746,"Abstract The histidyl-tRNA synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium was purified to homogeneity by methods described previously. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was determined as 78,000 by high speed equilibrium centrifugation and as 92,000 by gel filtration; a subunit molecular weight of about 40,000 was found by centrifugation in 6 m guanidine HCl, and by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The isoelectric point was found to be 5.9 by focusing in polyacrylamide gels; the extinction coefficient at 280 nm was determined to be 80,000 m-1 cm-1. The amino acid composition of the enzyme was determined. In particular, 8 cysteine, 34 lysine, 53 arginine, and 13 histidine residues were found for each molecule, calculated on the basis of an 80,000 molecular weight. Thirteen tryptophan residues were found by absorption spectroscopy in 6 m guanidine HCl; a tyrosine content of 20 residues per 80,000 was estimated. Titration with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reagent showed that 2 cysteine residues were free; titration with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reagent in 8 m urea demonstrated 2 additional cysteine residues. A peptide map of a tryptic digest showed the presence of about 33 ninhydrin staining spots; no NH2-terminal amino acid could be detected. It is inferred that the histidyl-tRNA synthetase in its native state is a dimer, probably composed of identical subunits. The enzyme is stable to storage in 50% glycerol at -20°; at 4° in dilute solution the enzyme slowly loses activity. Gel chromatography shows the appearance of a high molecular weight, inactive form during storage at 4°. This material can be reactivated by incubation with reducing agents."

https://openalex.org/W1647514245,"Abstract Recently we described the isolation and partial purification of a protein from T3 phage-infected Escherichia coli B cells. This protein markedly inhibits the activity of E. coli RNA polymerase, but it only slightly diminishes the activity of T3-specific T3 polymerase even when added at high concentrations (Mahadik. S. P., Dharmgrongartama, B., and Srinivasan, P. R. (1972) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 69, 162). This protein has no inhibitory effect on core polymerase activity and requires the presence of sigma factor for eliciting the inhibition. However, further addition of sigma factor failed to overcome the inhibition observed with E. coli RNA polymerase. The protein does not bind directly to DNA or RNA polymerase or RNA polymerase-DNA complex. The presence of ATP and GTP are required for the binding of the inhibitory protein to enzyme-DNA complex. The activity of the inhibitory protein is not observed in nonpermissive cells infected with an amber mutant in gene 1 defective in T3-specific T3 polymerase. Thus, the T3 phage gene responsible for the synthesis of the inhibitory protein is not an early gene and the transcription of this gene is under the control of T3 polymerase."

The renaturation from 8 m urea of mixtures originally containing the native and the modified enzymes is described. It is shown that during this process hybrid molecules are formed and that, after resolution of the unmodified coenzyme sites, the hybrid molecules remain tetrameric at low temperatures whereas the apoenzyme dissociates into dimers. This observation strongly supports previous results concerning the existence of a tight coupling between the tertiary structures of the protomers within tryptophanase."

https://openalex.org/W2049600754,"THE fundamental idea in a highly speculative new kind of muscle model1 was that a bond vibration is first produced by an exothermic chemical reaction, the energy is transferred resonantly to an electronic excited state of identical frequency, then trapped in an excimer state formed between two such electronic oscillators and finally converted into external work as the two oscillators approach each other. The first part of Naqvi's criticism2 was that the experiment I quoted as an example of energy trapping in excimers was mistaken. This I concede; clearly the pyrene experiments can no longer be used to show that excimer fluorescence is dipole-forbidden. The accepted theory clearly predicts, however, that, in special conditions, the excimer state may yet be long lived. In its longer version3 my muscle model already has a design feature which enables Naqvi's criticism to be overcome. If the oscillator was indeed first excited to a singlet state and only later diffused into interaction distance with another oscillator in the ground state then, as Naqvi argues, the triplet state would be at a lower energy and decay into it would be difficult to avoid. My suggestion3 was, however, that the energy of the bond vibration produced on ATP hydrolysis is less than that of the excited state of an isolated oscillator, so that only when the two oscillators are close enough to perturb each other sufficiently do they resonate with the bond vibration and then become excited. This feature was introduced, first, to protect the postulated bond vibration (by allowing it to be buried in a protein and yet to interact with the environment in this way) and, second, to ensure that only the anti-symmetric attractive excimer state is produced on excitation. I now suggest a third function: to ensure that the excimer only becomes excited when its energy is already below that of the triplet state. In this case decay into the triplet state would be prevented, and the fluorescence would become fully dipole-forbidden."
