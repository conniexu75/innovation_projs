https://openalex.org/W1975200587,"Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent disease in Western and developing societies. A major metabolic abnormality of non-insulin-dependent diabetes is impaired insulin action (insulin resistance). Diets high in fat from vegetable and nonaquatic animal sources (rich in linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, and saturated fats) lead to insulin resistance. In rats fed high-fat diets, replacement of only 6 percent of the linoleic omega-6 fatty acids from safflower oil with long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil prevented the development of insulin resistance. The effect was most pronounced in the liver and skeletal muscle, which have important roles in glucose supply and demand. The results may be important for therapy or prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2008132225,"Bacterial strains harboring the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis inv locus were analyzed in order to investigate the mechanism of host cell penetration by an invasive pathogen. The inv locus was found to be necessary for Y. pseudotuberculosis to enter HEp-2 cells and sufficient to convert E. coli into a microorganism able to penetrate cultured cells. Both E. coli and Y. pseudotuberculosis strains harboring inv mutations were defective for entry into HEp-2 cells. Furthermore, molecular clones containing inv, and little additional DNA, converted E. coli into a microorganism that was indistinguishable from the parental Yersinia strain with regard to the entry of cultured cells. Data from in vitro protein synthesis indicated that a 103 kd protein was synthesized from inv, saturating the coding capacity of the locus. The nucleotide sequence shows an open reading frame corresponding to a protein of similar size. This protein, called invasin, is necessary for the microorganisms to penetrate HEp-2 cells, and is compartmentalized on the outer surface of the bacterium."

Typical problems that use this approach involve characterization of peptides with blocked amino termini or peptides that have been otherwise posttranslationally processed, such as, by phosphorylation or sulfation. The structure and homogeneity of synthetic peptides can also be evaluated. Since peptides can be selectively characterized in the presence of other peptides or contaminants, the need for extensive purification is reduced or eliminated."
https://openalex.org/W1570648218,"A rat monoclonal antibody, GoH3, recognizes cell surface antigens on epithelial cells in a variety of tissues in both man and mouse. Furthermore, the antibody showed reactivity with endothelial cells and blood platelets. The molecule recognized by GoH3 on platelets was determined by immunoprecipitation, followed by analysis on one- and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. GoH3 precipitated glycoproteins Ic and IIa from both human and mouse platelets. Glycoprotein Ic consists of disulfide-linked heavy and light chains which both appeared to be glycosylated. As determined by enzymatic digestion followed by gel analyses, both and type of N-linked oligosaccharides are present on the heavy and light chain of human glycoprotein Ic and on the heavy chain of mouse glycoprotein Ic. The light chain of mouse glycoprotein Ic only carries high mannose type of N-linked oligosaccharides. The N-linked glycans on human and mouse glycoprotein IIa are all of the complex type. The glycoproteins Ic and IIa co-sedimented in sucrose gradients and formed complexes upon treatment of intact platelets with the chemical cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). Dissociation of the complex by chaotropic agents followed by immunoprecipitation establishes that the epitope recognized by GoH3 is located on the Ic molecule. These results provide evidence that the two glycoproteins, Ic and IIa, exist as a heterodimer complex in the platelet membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1975948611,"The RNA polymerase II large subunit contains tandem copies of the sequence Pro Thr Ser Pro Ser Tyr Ser at its carboxyl terminus, the number of which varies from 26 in yeast to 52 in mice. Our results indicate that the heptapeptide repeat sequence is unique and essential to RNA polymerase II. We have determined that a portion of the heptapeptide repeat domain is essential for viability by constructing and analyzing unidirectional deletions of the carboxy-terminal coding sequence in yeast. Cells containing an RNA polymerase II large subunit with less than 10 complete heptapeptide repeats are inviable, those containing 10-12 complete repeats are conditionally viable, and those with 13 or more complete repeats are unconditionally viable. The inviable deletion mutants studied here have truncated RNA polymerase subunits that are stable, but functionally deficient. Finally, the number of repeat units is polymorphic in wild-type yeast strains. These results have implications for the function of this unusual sequence in transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2004789938,"The role of the aspartic acid residue in the serine protease catalytic triad Asp, His, and Ser has been tested by replacing Asp102 of trypsin with Asn by site-directed mutagenesis. The naturally occurring and mutant enzymes were produced in a heterologous expression system, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. At neutral pH the mutant enzyme activity with an ester substrate and with the Ser195-specific reagent diisopropylfluorophosphate is approximately 104 times less than that of the unmodified enzyme. In contrast to the dramatic loss in reactivity of Ser195, the mutant trypsin reacts with the His57-specific reagent, tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone, only five times less efficiently than the unmodified enzyme. Thus, the ability of His57 to react with this affinity label is not severely compromised. The catalytic activity of the mutant enzyme increases with increasing pH so that at pH 10.2 the kcat is 6 percent that of trypsin. Kinetic analysis of this novel activity suggests this is due in part to participation of either a titratable base or of hydroxide ion in the catalytic mechanism. By demonstrating the importance of the aspartate residue in catalysis, especially at physiological pH, these experiments provide a rationalization for the evolutionary conservation of the catalytic triad."

https://openalex.org/W2013080075,"The initiation of transcription from the nitrogen-regulated promoter glnAp2 requires RNA polymerase containing sigma 54, the transcriptional activator NRI, and the protein kinase NRII, responsible for the conversion of NRI to the active NRI-phosphate. NRI-phosphate does not increase the ability of sigma 54-containing RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter, but rather stimulates the conversion of an initial promoter:polymerase complex to the transcriptionally active open complex. The presence on the DNA template of high-affinity binding sites for NRI/NRI-phosphate, normally located 130 and 100 bp upstream of the site of transcription initiation, results in a 4- to 5-fold lowering of the concentration of NRI required for the formation of the open complex. These high-affinity NRI binding sites facilitate open complex formation when they are moved to positions 700 bp further upstream or 950 bp downstream of glnAp2 on linear DNA templates."
https://openalex.org/W2061688076,"Gene expression is dependent on the interaction of DNA binding factors with distinct promoter control elements to activate RNA synthesis. The expression of the HIS4 gene in yeast is under two different control systems. One of these, general amino acid control, involves a DNA binding protein, GCN4, that stimulates transcription in response to amino acid starvation by binding to 5′-TGACTC-3′ sequences in the HIS4 promoter region. A second system, the basal level control, stimulates HIS4 transcription in the absence of amino acid starvation. The basal level transcription of the HIS4 gene is under the control of two genes, BAS1 and BAS2, which are also required for the control of purine biosynthesis. In addition, BAS2is required for the utilization of organic phosphates in the growth medium. Genetic mapping and DNA sequence analysis show that BAS2is PHO2, a gene previously identified as a regulator of phosphate metabolism. Direct biochemical analysis shows that the BAS2gene encodes a protein that binds to both the HIS4 and PHO5 promoters. The involvement of a single DNA binding protein in the regulation of histidine, adenine, and phosphate metabolism suggests that yeast may use a few key DNA binding proteins to coordinate the regulation of diverse metabolic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2079771997,"We show by electrophoresis mobility shift and by DNAase I footprinting assays that the α1 product of the yeast α mating-type locus binds to homologous sequences within the control regions of the three known α-specific genes. Binding requires both α1 and a second yeast protein(s) (called PRTF) that is present in all three cell types (a, α, and a/α); neither protein binds alone. Binding and competition experiments using synthetic oligonucleotides indicate that PRTF binds to only part of the homology found at α-specific genes and imply that α1 binds to the remainder. Our results suggest that α1 renders gene expression α-specific by creating a binding site for PRTF. Similar experiments lead to the idea that PRTF also plays a role in transcription of a-specific genes. Perhaps a-specificity is achieved through the occlusion of the PRTF binding site by α2, the negative regulator encoded by the α mating-type locus."

https://openalex.org/W1595604283,"The active form of one subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase (protein B2) contains an organic free radical localized to tyrosine 122 of its polypeptide chain. When this radical is scavenged, e.g. by treatment with hydroxyurea, the enzyme is inactivated (protein B2/HU). E. coli contains an enzyme system consisting of at least three proteins that in the presence of NADPH, FMN, dithiothreitol, and oxygen introduce the tyrosyl radical into B2/HU (Eliasson, R., Jornvall, H., and Reichard, P. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 2373-2377). One of the three proteins was identified as superoxide dismutase. We now identify a second protein, previously provisionally named Fraction c, as an NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase (flavin reductase). After 4,000-fold purification the protein moved as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of 28,000-29,000. The enzyme contained no flavin but reduced riboflavin, FMN, and FAD by NADH, or riboflavin and FMN by NADPH. It is a powerful ferric iron reductase. We propose that its complementing activity during radical generation involves participation in the reduction of the ferric iron center of protein B2/HU. Radical formation is then linked to the reoxidation of iron by oxygen. The flavin reductase may also participate in other aspects of iron metabolism of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2154192967,"To distinguish between mechanisms of eukaryotic transcriptional activation, we tested whether yeast upstream promoter elements can stimulate transcription by a heterologous transcription machinery, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. The gal enhancer-like element recognized by GAL4 protein or the ded1 poly(dA-dT) element was placed upstream of the T7 promoter and his3 structural gene, and T7 RNA polymerase was produced in yeast cells. Under conditions where the gal element would normally be either activating or nonactivating, his3 transcription by T7 RNA polymerase was not stimulated above the level observed in the absence of any upstream element. In contrast, the ded1 poly(dA-dT) element stimulated transcription 7-fold, similar to the enhancement observed on the native ded1 promoter. Activation by the ded1 element thus may involve effects on the chromatin template that facilitate entry of the transcription machinery, whereas activation by the gal element may involve specific contacts between GAL4 and the transcriptional machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1587756732,"In a subline of Reuber H35 rat hepatoma cells that becomes quiescent under serum-deprived conditions, insulin acts as a growth factor. When added to serum-deprived H35 cells, physiologic concentrations of insulin stimulate DNA synthesis, demonstrating that insulin alone is capable of inducing a transition from G0/G1 into S phase. This response, which is induced by nanomolar concentrations of insulin, is mediated directly through the insulin receptor. Here we show that coincident with this growth response, insulin or serum induces dramatic increases in the steady-state levels of c-fos and c-myc mRNAs in serum-deprived H35 cells in a time course similar to that observed in the regenerating liver. Other growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, appear not to affect these cells either in terms of DNA synthesis or c-myc mRNA induction. The phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) also induces c-myc and c-fos mRNAs without inducing DNA synthesis. However, the mechanism of this induction appears to be different from the insulin-induced induction since pretreatment of cells with PMA blocks only the PMA-mediated, not the insulin-mediated, induction of c-myc and c-fos."
https://openalex.org/W1579047767,"A glucocorticoid receptor-associated Mr approximately 90,000 non-hormone-binding protein was purified and characterized. The molybdate-stabilized nonactivated rat liver glucocorticoid-receptor complex (Mr approximately 300,000) was immunoadsorbed on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B to which a monoclonal IgG 2a antibody directed against the activated rat glucocorticoid receptor (Mr approximately 94,000) had been coupled. Following removal of molybdate and thermal activation of the receptor immobilized on the immunoaffinity matrix, an Mr approximately 90,000 non-hormone-binding protein was specifically eluted. This protein was further purified to homogeneity using high performance ion exchange chromatography and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation, and high performance size-exclusion chromatography. Hydrodynamic characterization under nondenaturing conditions revealed that the purified glucocorticoid receptor-associated protein represents a molecular species with a sedimentation coefficient of 6.1 S, a Stokes radius of 6.9 nm, and a calculated Mr approximately 184,000. These results, combined with analysis on denaturing electrophoresis indicate that, under certain conditions, the Mr approximately 94,000 steroid-binding protein is associated with a dimer of Mr approximately 90,000 non-hormone-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1581595030,"The hepatic vitamin A-storing Ito cell has been implicated as a causative cell in hepatic fibrogenesis. Using a modification of a recent method (Friedman, S. L., Roll, F. J., Boyles, J., and Bissell, D. M. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 8681-8685), rat Ito cells were isolated and passaged in vitro on collagen-coated plastic dishes through cell generation 40-50. The collagen synthetic phenotype for Ito cells grown on various extracellular matrices was demonstrated by immunofluorescence and quantitated by competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. When grown on a type I collagen matrix, Ito cells produced type IV greater than type III greater than type I collagen. When grown on a type IV collagen matrix, the cells produced relatively equal amounts of types I and III collagen. The absolute amounts of type I collagen produced were greater when cells were grown on type IV versus type I matrix. When 10(-5) M retinol was added to cell cultures, there was a uniform increase in type III collagen regardless of matrix type but a decrease in type I collagen when cells were grown on a type IV matrix and a large increase in type I collagen when cells were grown on a type I collagen matrix. The levels of cellular retinol binding protein, a key cytosolic retinol transport protein, were quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography and compared for cells grown on type I versus type IV collagen matrices. It was found that cells on a type I matrix contain 4.96 +/- 2.8 times more cellular retinol binding protein than do cells grown on a type IV matrix. In conclusion, Ito cell collagen synthesis may be altered by underlying extracellular matrix and exogenous retinol. This in vitro culture system should allow the study of regulatory factors and possible therapeutic anti-fibrogenic mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1583765319,"Cultured human cytotrophoblasts synthesize and secrete urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) during the first 24 h of culture, but secretion declines during the subsequent day. In contrast, synthesis and secretion of fibronectin increases during the 2 days of culture. The levels of uPA mRNA parallel the changes in synthesis and secretion of uPA. Treatment of cytotrophoblasts with 8-bromo-cAMP (1.5 mM) transiently raises uPA mRNA levels and uPA secretion. This treatment reduces fibronectin mRNA levels and causes a sustained increase in beta chorionic gonadotropin mRNA content and chorionic gonadotropin secretion. We conclude that a cAMP-mediated process up-regulates uPA expression in cytotrophoblasts. However, the stimulatory effect of the cyclic nucleotide analog on uPA is transient."
https://openalex.org/W1525497365,"To detect nuclear proteins that might be involved in induction of cellular mitogenesis, we examined the effect of various mitogens on early changes in synthesis of nuclear proteins in murine B lymphocytes. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we found that activation of B cells by mitogens (anti-immunoglobulin antibody, lipopolysaccharide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/A23187) was associated with a rapid and prominent (5-20-fold) increase in the synthesis of a 40-kDa/pI 5.0 nuclear protein, here termed numatrin. Numatrin was found to be absent from the cytosol (soluble fraction) of resting as well as activated B cells and was markedly resistant to DNase/RNase digestion and 2 N NaCl extraction, indicating that this protein is tightly bound to the nuclear matrix. Kinetic studies showed that the increase in synthesis of numatrin was detected 60-120 min following mitogen activation, reached a peak at 16 h, and declined to almost control level by 48 h, correlating with the peak of cellular DNA synthesis. The increase in synthesis of numatrin in normal B cells was found to be associated exclusively with cellular commitment for mitogenesis because activation of B cells by stimuli such as B cell stimulating factor 1, PMA alone, and calcium ionophore A23187, which do not stimulate an increase in DNA synthesis, also failed to induce an increase in the synthesis of numatrin. Inhibition of anti-Ig-induced proliferation (by PMA pretreatment) was associated with a 63% inhibition in the synthesis of numatrin. Addition of 8-mercaptoguanosine to these PMA-treated cells was associated with restoration of the increase in synthesis of numatrin, concomitant with induction of proliferation. Elevated synthesis of numatrin was also detected in the malignant B lymphoma cells: Raji, BAL-17, and WEHI-231. Taken collectively, these results suggest that numatrin, a tightly bound nuclear matrix protein, is a growth-regulated protein which might have an important role in regulation of cellular mitogenesis in normal and malignant B lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1554751699,"The counterregulatory action of catecholamines on insulin-stimulated glucose transport and its relation to glucose transporter phosphorylation were studied in isolated rat adipose cells. Plasma membranes exhibiting reduced glucose transport activity were prepared as described previously (Joost, H. G., Weber, T. M., Cushman, S. W., and Simpson, I. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10033-10036) from cells treated with insulin, and subsequently with isoproterenol and adenosine deaminase. In these membranes, transporter affinity for cytochalasin B binding was significantly reduced (KD = 133.5 +/- 14 versus 89.8 +/- 11 nM, means +/- S.E.) with no change in number of sites or immunoreactivity of the transporter on Western blots. Reconstituted plasma membrane transport was significantly lower with isoproterenol treatment (0.50 +/- 0.12 versus 0.97 +/- 0.27 nmol/mg protein/10 s). In contrast, transport activity reconstituted from corresponding intracellular transporters (from low density microsomes) was unchanged (5.4 +/- 2.2 versus 6.9 +/- 1.2 nmol/mg protein/10 s). Thus, the intrinsic activity change of the transporter produced by catecholamines appears to reflect a structural modification that is confined to the plasma membrane and not recycled into the intracellular compartment. In cells equilibrated with [32P]phosphate, neither insulin nor isoproterenol induced [32P]phosphate incorporation into the glucose transporter immunoprecipitated from plasma membranes. Conversely, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated significant incorporation of [32P]phosphate into the glucose transporter in insulin-stimulated cells without any change in plasma membrane transport activity or transporter concentration. Thus, the phosphorylation state of the glucose transporter does not seem to be involved in either signaling transporter translocation or triggering changes in transporter intrinsic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1585766539,"A new set of bis(5'-nucleosidyl) tetraphosphates, the Bp4B' nucleotides (B and B' = C, G, or U not equal to A), are demonstrated in living cells. In exponentially growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cellular concentrations of Cp4U, Up4U, Gp4G, Cp4C, Gp4U, and Gp4C are 210, 200, 60, 50, 40, and 30 nM, respectively. It is likely that these nucleotides originate from the action of diadenosine-5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate alpha,beta-phosphorylase, an enzyme recently found in yeast. Upon temperature shift or exposure to cadmium, the Bp4B' nucleotides strongly accumulate in the yeast cells. In Escherichia coli, the same nucleotides occur, and similar effects of temperature shift or of cadmium are observed. However, in the bacterium, the origin of these nucleotides is not known. To quantitate these nucleotides in cellular extracts, specific procedures were developed. In the first step, after purification of the mixture of Np4N' (N and N' = A, C, G, or U) nucleotides, the Ap4N nucleotides are specifically removed by incubation with lysyl-tRNA synthetase. In the second step, the Bp4B' species are resolved with the help of anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography. In the third step, the concentration of each Bp4B' is measured using three coupled enzymatic reactions to produce ATP and bioluminescence. With this strategy, 0.01 pmol of any Bp4B' nucleotide can be reliably detected."
https://openalex.org/W1537309339,"Soluble extracts prepared from quiescent Swiss mouse 3T3 cells that had been briefly exposed to various mitogens exhibited a 2- to 3-fold elevation in phosphorylating activities toward ribosomal protein S6 and a synthetic peptide, Arg-Arg-Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg-Ala (RRLSSLRA), patterned after a phosphorylation site sequence from S6. Optimal activation of the phosphorylating activity occurred within 15-20 min of exposure of the cells to platelet-derived growth factor (10 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (100 nM), and insulin (100 nM), and 2-5 min after 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (100 nM) treatment. Fractionation of the cytosolic extracts from mitogen- or TPA-treated cells on Sephacryl S-300, TSK-400, and DEAE-Sephacel columns gave results suggesting that a single stimulated kinase accounted for the enhanced S6 and RRLSSLRA phosphorylating activities. The mitogen-activated kinase had an apparent Mr of about 85,000 as determined with Sephacryl S-300, but eluted with an apparent Mr of 26,000 from a TSK-400 high pressure liquid chromatography column. The S6 kinase was also stimulated in cytosols from insulin-like growth factor 1- (100 nM), vasopressin- (250 nM), prostaglandin F2 alpha- (250 nM), and 10% fetal calf serum-treated cells but not from quiescent cells exposed to beta-transforming growth factor (2 ng/ml). TPA, vasopressin and prostaglandin F2 alpha appeared to stimulate this kinase via a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism, since the responses to these hormones, but not to platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and insulin, were lost in protein kinase C-depleted cells."
https://openalex.org/W1563007775,"Fluorescence and optical detection of triplet state magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy have been employed to study the complexes formed between single-stranded polynucleotides and Escherichia coli ssb gene products (SSB) in which tryptophans 40, 54, and 88 are selectively, one residue at a time, replaced by phenylalanine using site-specific oligonucleotide mutagenesis. Fluorescence titrations and ODMR results indicate that tryptophans 40 and 54 are the only tryptophan residues in E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein that are involved in stabilizing the protein-nucleic acid complexes via stacking interactions. Wavelength-selected ODMR measurements on E. coli SSB reveal the presence of two spectrally distinct tryptophan sites (Khamis, M. I., Casas-Finet, J. R., and Maki, A. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1725-1733). Our present results indicate that tryptophan 54 belongs to the blue-shifted site, while tryptophan 40 belongs to the red-shifted site of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1551570734,"The 5'- and 3'-tRNA processing nucleases have been isolated from rat liver mitochondria. The two activities co-purified through heparin-agarose and phenyl-Sepharose columns and then efficiently separated on a DEAE-cellulose column. The 5' processing nuclease was found in the flow-through fraction, and the 3' processing activity eluted with 0.5 M KCl. Both enzymes were greater than 500-fold purified over the high speed supernatant of a mitoplast extract. The 159-base pre-tRNATyr used as a substrate in this study was synthesized in vitro and contained the Escherichia coli suppressor III tRNATyr plus a 49-base leader sequence and a 25-base trailing sequence. The 5' processing nuclease converted the pre-tRNATyr into two discrete RNA species, identified as the 5'-processed intermediate and the 5' flanking fragment, by endonucleolytic cleavage at the 5' end of the mature tRNATyr sequence. The 3' processing nuclease was inactive with the intact pre-tRNATyr as substrate but efficiently converted the 5'-processed intermediate to the mature tRNATyr, indicating an obligatory order of processing in which 5' maturation was necessary before cleavage by the 3' processing nuclease could occur. The mitochondrial enzymes exhibited optimal activity in the presence of about 2 mM Mg2+, but both enzymes were nearly fully active without addition of exogenous Mg2+ to the reaction mixtures. In contrast, a partially purified 5' processing endonuclease present in the postmitochondrial cytosolic fraction required higher [Mg2+] for activity, thus providing a means for differentiating between these similar enzyme activities obtained from the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions."
https://openalex.org/W1567668759,"Acyl-peptide hydrolase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of an N-terminally acetylated peptide to release an N-acetylamino acid, was isolated from rat liver and found to be N-terminally blocked. The kinetics of the hydrolysis of acetyl (Ac)-Ala-Ala, Ac-Ala-Ala-Ala, acetylalanine p-nitroanilide, and acetylalanine beta-naphthylamide were investigated. The Km values were between 1 and 9 mM, and the Vmax values were between 100 and 500 nmol/min/micrograms of enzyme. The enzyme activity toward acetylalanine p-nitroanilide and acetylalanine beta-naphthylamide was activated by the presence of Cl- and SCN- at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 M. By contrast, the activity toward Ac-Ala-Ala and Ac-Ala-Ala-Ala was inhibited by these anions. Among a series of divalent cations, Zn2+ was demonstrated to be the most potent inhibitor. The enzyme was inactivated by the addition of diisopropyl fluorophosphate, diethyl pyrocarbonate. Woodward's Reagent K, and glycine methyl ester/carbodiimide. Titration by diisopropyl fluorophosphate showed 0.7 mol of active serine/mol of enzyme subunit, which was confirmed by the incorporation of [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate into the enzyme. Acetylalanine chloromethyl ketone inactivated the enzyme following pseudo-first order kinetics; and Ac-Ala, a competitive inhibitor, protected the enzyme from this inactivation. Acyl-peptide hydrolase appears to be a serine protease utilizing a charge relay system involving serine, histidine, and, probably, a carboxyl group(s). Two series of acetyl dipeptides, acetylamino acid p-nitroanilides and acetylamino acid beta-naphthylamides, were prepared in order to determine enzyme specificity. The enzyme preferentially removed Ac-Ala, Ac-Met, and Ac-Ser, the most common acetylated N-terminal residues (Persson, B., Flinta, C., von Heijne, G., and Jornvall, H. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 152, 523-527). The enzyme was shown to be useful for deblocking peptides (e.g. alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and acetyl-renin substrate), and the crude enzyme/substrate mixtures were amenable to direct protein sequence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1607587755,"A human interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta cDNA was cloned, and the region coding for the mature protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The 17-kDa biologically active product was purified in 40% yield to apparent homogeneity, without chaotropes, from the soluble fraction of sonicated cell lysates. The recombinant IL-1 beta was characterized by amino acid analysis, NH2- and COOH-terminal sequence analysis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, spectroscopy, and biological assay. Specific biological activity was 4.6 × 10(8) units/mg in a co-mitogenic IL-2 induction assay using cultured EL-4 T-lymphocytes. The molar extinction coefficient was determined to be 10,300 cm-1 M-1 at 280 nm. NH2-terminal sequence analysis revealed that 70% of the product begins with the Ala corresponding to the NH2 terminus of the natural protein, while 30% begins with the following Pro. No initiator Met was observed. Both of the sulfhydryl groups are reactive to Ellman's reagent and to iodoacetamide under nonreducing conditions, indicating that the Cys residues do not form disulfide bonds. S-Carboxamidomethyl-Cys-rIL-1 beta retained biological activity in the IL-2 induction assay. Circular dichroism suggested an extensive beta sheet structure for rIL-1 beta."
https://openalex.org/W1582951957,"A major component of the Escherichia coli response to elevated medium osmolarity is the synthesis of a periplasmic protein with an Mr of 31,000. The protein was absent in mutants with lambda placMu insertions in the proU region, a locus involved in transport of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine. This periplasmic protein has now been purified to homogeneity. Antibody directed against the purified periplasmic protein crossreacts with the fusion protein produced as a result of the lambda placMu insertion, indicating that proU is the structural gene specifying the 31-kDa protein. The purified protein binds glycine betaine with high affinity but has no affinity for either proline or choline, clarifying the role of proU in osmoprotectant transport. The amino-terminal sequence of the mature glycine betaine binding protein is Ala-Asp-Leu-Pro-Gly-Lys-Gly-Ile-Thr-Val-Asn-Pro."
https://openalex.org/W1560164243,"Previous studies have suggested that the COOH-terminal pentapeptide of the insulin B-chain can play a negative role in ligand-receptor interactions involving insulin analogs having amino acid replacements at position B25 (Nakagawa, S. H., and Tager, H. S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7332-7341). We undertook by the current investigations to identify the molecular site in insulin that induces this negative effect and to explore further the importance of conformational changes that might occur during insulin-receptor interactions. By use of semisynthetic insulin analogs containing amino acid replacements or deletions and of isolated canine hepatocytes, we show here that (a) the markedly decreased affinity of receptor for insulin analogs in which PheB25 is replaced by Ser is apparent for analogs in which up to 3 residues of the insulin B-chain have been deleted, but is progressively reversed in the corresponding des-tetrapeptide and des-pentapeptide analogs, and (b) unlike the case for deletion of TyrB26 and ThrB27, replacement of residue TyrB26 or ThrB27 has no effect to reverse the decreased affinity of full length analogs containing Ser for Phe substitutions at position B25. Additional experiments demonstrated that introduction of a cross-link between Lys epsilon B29 and Gly alpha A1 of insulin decreases the affinity of ligand-receptor interactions whether or not PheB25 is replaced by Ser. We conclude that the negative effect of the COOH-terminal B-chain domain on insulin-receptor interactions arises in greatest part from the insulin mainchain near the site of the TyrB26-ThrB27 peptide bond and that multiple conformational perturbations may be necessary to induce a high-affinity state of receptor-bound insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1502429485,"A heparin-binding peptide within antithrombin III (ATIII) was identified by digestion of ATIII with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease followed by purification on reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C-4 column matrix. The column fractions were assayed for their ability to bind heparin by ligand blotting with 125I-fluoresceinamine-heparin as previously described (Smith, J. W., and Knauer, D. J. (1987) Anal. Biochem. 160, 105-114). This analysis identified at least three fractions with heparin binding ability of which the peptide eluting at 25.4 min gave the strongest signal. Amino acid sequence analysis of this peptide gave a partially split sequence which was consistent with regions encompassing amino acids 89-96 and 114-156. These amino acids are present in a 1:1 molar ratio which is consistent with a disulfide linkage between Cys-95 and Cys-128. High affinity heparin competed more effectively for the binding of 125I-fluoresceinamine-heparin to this peptide than low affinity heparin. Chondroitin sulfate did not block the binding of 125I-fluoresceinamine-heparin to the peptide. These data strongly suggest that the isolated peptide represents a native heparin-binding region within intact ATIII. Computer generation of a plot of running charge density of ATIII confirms that the region encompassing amino acid residues 123-141 has the highest positive charge density within the molecule. A hydropathy plot of ATIII was generated using a method similar to that of Kyte and Doolittle (Kyte, J., and Doolittle, R. F. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157, 105-132). This plot indicates that amino acid residues 126-140 are exposed to the exterior surface of the molecule. Based on these data, we suggest that the region corresponding to amino acid residues 114-156 is a likely site for the physiological heparin-binding domain of ATIII. We also conclude that the proposed disulfide bridges within the protein are suspect and should be re-examined (Petersen, T. E., Dudek-Wojiechowska, G., Sottrup-Jensen, L., and Magnussun, S. (1979) in The Physiological Inhibitors of Coagulation and Fibrinolysis (Collen, D., Wiman, B., and Verstaeta, M., eds) pp. 43-54, Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Amsterdam)."
https://openalex.org/W1583771709,"Abstract The crucial step in enzymatic transamination is the tautomerization of aldimine/ketimine intermediates, formed between the pyridoxyl coenzyme and the amino/keto acid substrate, which is catalyzed primarily by the active site residue Lys-258 (Malcolm, B. A., and Kirsch, J. F. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 132, 915-921; W. L. Finlayson and J. F. Kirsch, in preparation). Tyr-70 is localized in close proximity to Lys-258 and, in addition, forms a hydrogen bond with the coenzyme phosphate. Tyr-70 has been postulated to have an important role in the tautomerization (Kirsch, J. F., Eichele, G., Ford, G. C., Vincent, M. G., Jansonius, J. N., Gehring, H., and Christen, P. (1984) J. Mol. Biol. 174, 497-525). This hypothesis has now been tested by the construction and analysis of a mutant Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase in which Tyr-70 has been changed to Phe (Y70F). Y70F retains at least 15% of the maximal activity of the wild type enzyme (WT) (kcat = 170 +/- 15 s-1 for WT versus greater than or equal to 26 +/- 3 s-1 for Y70F and shows increased Michaelis constants for both substrates (KmAsp = 2.5 +/- 0.4 mM; Km alpha Kg = 0.59 +/- 0.08 mM for WT versus KmAsp = 3.9 +/- 0.3 mM; Km alpha Kg = 2.70 +/- 0.02 mM for Y70F (where alpha Kg is alpha-ketoglutarate) ). The spectrophotometrically determined pK a values of the internal aldimines formed between pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and Lys-258 are identical for WT and Y70F. In assays where excess L-aspartate and excess PLP are incubated with either WT or Y70F, the mutant enzyme converts the free PLP to free pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate 80-fold faster than WT (k = (3.75 +/- 0.23) X 10(-2)s-1 for Y70F versus (4.90 +/- 0.02) X 10(-4)s-1 for WT). Y70F also converts free pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate to free PLP faster than WT. Thus, Y70F dissociates coenzyme more readily than does WT. It therefore appears that the role of Tyr-70 is mainly in preventing the dissociation of the coenzyme from the enzyme. Tyr-70 does not function in an essential chemical step."
https://openalex.org/W1569332331,"The protein moiety responsible for Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity was identified in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM). This was done by raising polyclonal antibodies in rabbits against each one of the detectable proteins present in the purified preparation containing the enriched specific transport activity. Two of the antibody preparations bound specifically to native SPM: antibodies which were raised against the 70,000-Da protein (the most prominent species consistently present in the purified preparation) and antibodies raised against a 33,000-Da protein (inconsistently present in variable amounts in the purified preparation). Both antibodies bound exclusively to a protein of 70,000 Da in native SPM. When, however, the purified 33,000- and 70,000-Da proteins were used as antigens, each one of the antibody preparations bound to both proteins. In addition, both antibody preparations immunoprecipitated Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ transport activity from detergent-solubilized SPM. This was obtained by incubation of solubilized SPM with a complex containing antibodies bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads, reconstitution of the material excluded from the beads, and determination of the residual transport activity. The decrease in Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ transport activity paralleled the amount of antibody bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads and could reach 82% as compared to the activity remaining in control experiments using preimmune sera. In comparison, ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport activity was unimpaired. These results indicate that the 70,000-Da protein in SPM contains the catalytic Na+-Ca2+ antiport activity. The presence of the 33,000-Da protein in some preparations and its properties may be explained by its being either a degradation product or a subunit of the 70,000-Da protein."
https://openalex.org/W1521976697,"The carboxyl-terminal sequences of the two polypeptide chains of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae K1 killer toxin were determined by protein sequencing and amino acid analysis of peptide fragments generated from the mature, secreted toxin. The COOH-terminal amino acid of the beta chain is histidine 316, the final residue encoded by the precursor gene. The COOH terminus of the alpha chain is at alanine 147 of the preprotoxin. Amino acid composition data for the purified toxin are consistent with that predicted from the gene sequence of the preprotoxin where the alpha and beta subunits consist of amino acid residues 45-147 and 234-316, respectively. The molecular weight of the mature alpha beta dimer is about 20,658. The COOH-terminal sequence determination completes the location of the toxin subunits in the precursor, and its configuration may be represented as prepropeptide-Pro-Arg-alpha-Arg-Arg-gamma-Lys-Arg-beta, where gamma represents the interstitial glycosylated peptide. The COOH terminal side of the paired basic residues (Arg-148 Arg-149 and Lys-232 Arg-233 of preprotoxin) are endoproteolytic processing sites for the product of the KEX2 gene (Julius, D., Brake, A., Blair, L., Kunisawa, R., and Thorner, J. (1984) Cell 37, 1075-1089), and thus maturation of the alpha subunit of killer toxin apparently requires a carboxypeptidase B-like activity. A possible candidate for this activity is the product of the KEX1 gene (Dmochowska, A., Dignard, D., Henning, D., Thomas, D.Y., and Bussey, H. (1987) Cell, in press)."
https://openalex.org/W311036015,"The primary structure of all actins except that isolated from Naegleria gruberi contains a unique N tau-methylhistidine (MeHis) at position 73. This modified residue has been implicated as possibly being important for the post-translational processing of actin's amino terminus, the binding of actin to DNase I, and in the polymerization of G-actin. We have investigated the potential role of MeHis in each of these processes by utilizing site-directed mutagenesis to change His-73 of skeletal muscle actin to Arg and Tyr. Wild type and mutant actins were synthesized in vivo, using non-muscle cells transfected with mutant cDNAs, and in vitro by translating mutant RNAs synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We have found that actins containing Arg or Tyr at position 73 undergo amino-terminal processing, bind to DNase I-agarose, and become incorporated into the cytoskeleton of a nonmuscle cell as efficiently as wild type actin. Furthermore, using an in vitro copolymerization assay we have found that although there is no difference between the Arg mutant and the wild type actins, the Tyr mutant has a slightly greater critical concentration for polymerization. These results show that MeHis is not absolutely required for any of these processes."
https://openalex.org/W1499349210,"Glycophorins of erythrocytes of two unrelated individuals who exhibit the Dantu blood group phenotype were studied. Immunoblots indicated that erythrocytes of each individual contained a complement of a normal alpha-glycophorin (glycophorin A) and a variant N-glycophorin. delta-Glycophorin (glycophorin B) was present in one donor's cells but not the other's; the s and N phenotypes of the latter's erythrocytes may derive from the variant glycophorin. The variant glycophorin is of a smaller size, does not bind to Lens culinaris lectin agarose, and lacks residues approximately 40-60 of alpha-glycophorin and its single asparagine-linked carbohydrate; it contains approximately 2 less O-glycosidically bound units whose structures are identical to those found in alpha-glycophorins. All these properties are characteristic of delta-glycophorin. The variant is related to alpha-glycophorin in the carboxyl-terminal region as shown by reaction with a specific antiserum. Sequence analyses of a mixture of chymotryptic peptides of a CNBr fragment of the variant glycophorin identified the sequence Val-His-Arg-Phe-Thr-Val-Pro-Glu-Ile-Thr-Leu-Ile-Ile that contains the junction point of delta- and alpha-glycophorins spanning residues 33-38/39 of delta-glycophorin and residues 71/72-77 of alpha-glycophorin. Sequence analysis of a mixture of CNBr fragments allowed us to conclude that the variant originates from delta-s- rather than delta-S-glycophorin. The quantity of the variant Dantu glycophorin when compared to alpha-glycophorin differed in the two individuals, the ratio being 2/1 in one individual's cells and 0.5/1 in the other's. This may reflect that the two donors belong to different varieties of Dantu phenotypes. Together, the evidence indicates that both donors' erythrocytes contain a (delta-alpha) variant glycophorin, whose amino terminus originates from delta-s-glycophorin and the carboxyl end from alpha-glycophorin with a junction point around residues 39 of delta- and 71 of alpha-glycophorins. The results suggest that the unique junction region may be characteristic of the Dantu phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1558780056,"GLN4 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an amino-terminal extension of 224 amino acids. This is connected to a polypeptide which is colinear with and 40% identical to Escherichia coli glutamine tRNA synthetase. We examined the potential significance of the amino-terminal extension. Two single base and five multiple base frame shift deletions were constructed in this segment. Each of these mutations is associated with a lethal phenotype. This suggests that the coding sequence for the amino-terminal extension is translated. It also implies that there are no translation restarts downstream of the coding region for the amino-terminal extension which produce active enzyme. Three internal deletions of various sizes, and which preserve the correct reading frame, were constructed in the coding region of the amino-terminal extension. Cells which harbor such in-frame deletions on a multi copy plasmid are viable, even when a deletion construct is the only source of GLN4-encoded activity. Extracts of cells which have one of these deletions have reduced, but measurable, glutamine tRNA synthetase activity. We conclude that the catalytic activity resides with the segment which is homologous to the E. coli enzyme and that the amino-terminal extension itself is dispensable for aminoacylation activity. Each of the internal in-frame deletion constructions is respiration-proficient. The amino-terminal extension, therefore, is not used for an essential mitochondrial function of the GLN4 gene product. Within the accuracy of the measurements, activities of four other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are not affected by the presence of a GLN4 internal deletion allele as the only source of GLN4-encoded activity. This suggests that the amino-terminal extension does not stabilize a complex which includes one or more of these four enzymes and whose activity depends on proper assembly of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1539885440,"The bacteriophage T4 gene 55 protein endows Escherichia coli RNA polymerase core with the ability to recognize T4 late promoters. In these experiments, we show that T4 gene product (gp) 55, like the major E. coli RNA polymerase initiation subunit sigma 70, is released from elongating transcription complexes and is thus capable of cycling among molecules of RNA polymerase core. We also show that, paradoxically, sigma 70 is able to displace T4 gp55 from its site of binding to E. coli RNA polymerase core. After T4 infection, the core enzyme is ADP-ribosylated in each alpha subunit, and a T4-coded 11.4-kDa protein (rpbA) binds tightly to it; these modifications do not save gp55 from displacement by sigma 70. However, open T4 late promoter complexes, containing gp55, are resistant to attack by sigma 70."
https://openalex.org/W1579174150,"Adipocytes route internalized insulin through two major pathways, a degradative pathway and a retroendocytotic pathway. To examine whether sorting of incoming insulin-receptor complexes can be altered, we assessed the effect of vanadate on the intracellular processing of both insulin and insulin receptors. After cells were pretreated with vanadate (1 mM for 30 min at 37 degrees C), 125I-insulin was loaded into the cell interior. When the net efflux of insulin from cells into the medium was then monitored, vanadate was found to slow the efflux of insulin from a t1/2 of 6.2 min (controls) to 11 min. Since efflux reflects both the rapid extrusion of intact insulin and the slower release of degradative products, we proposed that vanadate diverts more insulin into the degradative pathway. Further evidence in support of this idea included the following: 1) when intracellular degradation of insulin was impaired by chloroquine, undegraded insulin accumulated faster within vanadate-treated cells, consistent with greater flux through a degradative pathway; 2) vanadate increased the percentage of degraded insulin released from cells from 61 and 72%; and 3) under steady-state binding conditions, more insulin resided in the cell interior of vanadate-treated cells (44.8% versus 34.5%), and the time required for the intracellular pool to reach equilibrium was prolonged (t1/2 of 5.5 min versus 4.0). Neither insulin internalization nor degradation was impaired by vanadate alone. In related studies Tris was found to inhibit insulin-mediated receptor recycling by only 10%, whereas in the presence of vanadate (plus Tris) almost all incoming insulin receptors were prevented from recycling. Vanadate alone had no effect on the ability of insulin receptors to recycle. Based on these results we conclude that: 1) vanadate shunts incoming insulin from a more rapid retroendocytotic pathway to a slower degradative pathway and diverts insulin receptors from a Tris-insensitive recycling pathway to one that can be completely inhibited by Tris; 2) these effects are selective, in that vanadate impairs neither insulin degradation nor receptor uptake and recycling. Considered together, these findings support the idea that a sorting mechanism exists for the intracellular routing of incoming insulin-receptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1595995279,"Abstract The nucleotide of the Escherichia coli dnaC gene and the primary structure of the dnaC protein were determined. The NH2-terminal amino acid of the dnaC protein matched that predicted from the nucleotide of the 735-base pair coding region. The dnaC gene lacks characteristic promoter structures; neither the Pribnow box nor the -35 sequence was detected within 222 base pairs upstream from the initiator ATG codon. There is, however, a typical Shine-Dalgarno 7-10 base pairs before the ATG codon. An upstream open reading frame, separated by just 2 base pairs from the coding region of dnaC, encodes the COOH-terminal half of the dnaT product (protein i; Masai, H., Bond, M. W., and Arai, K. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 1256-1260). The dnaC protein contains 245 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 27,894 consistent with the observed value (29,000). Similar to dnaG and dnaT, dnaC uses several minor codons; the significance of these minor codons to the low level expression of the protein product in E. coli cells remains to be determined. The in vitro site-directed mutagenesis method was employed to determine the functional region involved in interaction with dnaB protein. The first cysteine residue located in the NH2-terminal region of the dnaC protein (Cys69) was shown to be important for this activity. Overall homology between dnaC protein and lambda P protein, functionally analogous to the dnaC protein in the lambda phage DNA replication, is not extensive. There are, however, several short stretches of homologous regions including the NH2-terminal eight amino acids and the Cys78 region of dnaC protein."
https://openalex.org/W1532264181,"The crystalloid endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of UT-1 cells is a specialized smooth ER that houses 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a membrane protein that regulates endogenous cholesterol synthesis. The biogenesis of this ER is coupled to the over production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. To understand better this membrane system and the relationship between the synthesis of a membrane protein and the formation of membrane, we have purified the crystalloid ER. Purified crystalloid ER did not contain significant amounts of membrane derived from the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, or plasma membrane. Approximately 24% of the protein in this organelle corresponded to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; however, at least eight other proteins were detected by gel electrophoresis. One of these proteins (Mr 73,000) was as abundant as reductase. These results suggest that the biogenesis of this ER involves the coordinate synthesis of multiple membrane and content proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1601914012,"Abstract A functional interaction between the signal sequence and the translation apparatus which may serve as a first step in chain targeting to the membrane is described. To this end, we exploited the powerful technique of molecular cloning in a procaryotic system and the well characterized translocation system of mammalian endoplasmic reticulum. The signal peptide of subunit B of the heat labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (EltB) was fused to several proteins. Single base substitutions were introduced in the signal peptide and their effect on protein synthesis and translocation was studied. We sought a single amino acid substitution which may define certain steps in the coordinated regulation of chain synthesis and targeting to the membrane. The substitution of proline for leucine at residue -8 in the signal peptide abolished all known functions of the signal peptide. In contrast to wild type signal peptide, the mutant signal peptide did not lead to arrest of nascent chain synthesis by signal recognition particle or translocation of the precursor protein across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, the mutant signal peptide was not cleaved by purified E. coli signal peptidase. Interestingly, the mutation resulted in about a 2-fold increase in the rate of synthesis of the precursor protein, suggesting a role for the signal peptide in regulating the synthesis of the nascent secretory chain as a means of ensuring early and efficient targeting of this chain to the membrane. This role might involve interaction of the signal peptide with components of the translation apparatus and/or endogenous signal recognition particle. These results were obtained with three different fusion proteins carrying the signal peptide of EltB thus leading to the conclusion that the effect of the mutation on the structure and function of the signal peptide is independent of the succeeding sequence to which the signal peptide is attached."
https://openalex.org/W1603434421,"The enzyme ATP citrate-lyase of the fatty acid synthesis pathway is phosphorylated in vitro and in isolated cells. However, no effect of phosphorylation on the enzyme activity has been detected. It is demonstrated that the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or insulin both promote an immobilization of ATP citrate-lyase, detected in digitonin-permeabilized adipocytes. This effect was reproduced by the cyclic AMP analog cyclic 8-bromo-AMP. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol blocked, but failed to reverse, the isoproterenol-directed effect. Propranolol also failed to reverse the isoproterenol-induced increased phosphorylation of ATP citrate-lyase specifically. In response to increasing concentrations of isoproterenol, an increased extent of phosphorylation of ATP citrate-lyase was paralleled by an increased immobilization of the enzyme. It is suggested that the state of phosphorylation of ATP citrate-lyase in adipocytes controls the localization in the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1597285736,"The ribosomal translocation, as measured in vitro by peptide formation on poly(U)-programmed Escherichia coli ribosomes in the presence of ternary complex, deacylated tRNA or N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA, and elongation factor G, is the rate-limiting step of protein synthesis. Elongation factor G stimulates the spontaneous translocation by a factor of about 500. N-Acetyl-Phe-Phe-tRNA(Phe E. coli) is translocated with a rate constant of 1-2 s-1 at 25 degrees C. Translocation of N-acetyl-Phe-Phe-tRNA(Phe yeast) and N-acetyl-Phe-Leu-tRNA(Leu E. coli) under identical conditions proceeds with a rate by about a factor of 2 and 10, respectively, more slowly. The translocation rate, therefore, is influenced by the nature of the tRNAs in the A-site. We can show, furthermore, that also the tRNA in the P-site, and presumably in the E-site as well, influences the rate of translocation. Reduced rates of translocation of noncognate peptidyl-tRNAs are accompanied by preferential dissociation of these tRNAs at the beginning of the translation of a mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1592869261,"The aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli contains two terminal oxidases, the cytochrome o complex and the cytochrome d complex. These both function as ubiquinol-8 oxidases and reduce molecular oxygen to water. Electron flux is funneled from a variety of dehydrogenases, such as succinate dehydrogenase, through ubiquinone-8, to either of the terminal oxidases. A strain was examined which lacks the intact cytochrome d complex, but which overproduces one of the two subunits of this complex, cytochrome b558. This cytochrome, in the absence of the other subunit of the oxidase complex, does not possess catalytic activity. It is shown that the extent of reduction of cytochrome b558 in the E. coli membrane monitors the extent of reduction of the quinone pool in the membrane. The activity of each purified oxidase was examined in phospholipid vesicles as a function of the amount of ubiquinone-8 incorporated in the bilayer. A ratio of ubiquinol-8:phospholipid as low as 1:200 is sufficient to saturate each oxidase. The maximal turnover of the oxidases in the reconstituted system is considerably faster than observed in E. coli membranes, demonstrating that the rate-limiting step in the E. coli respiratory chain is at the dehydrogenases which feed electrons into the system."
