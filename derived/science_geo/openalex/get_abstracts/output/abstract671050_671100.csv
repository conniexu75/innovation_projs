https://openalex.org/W3137012608,"Four out of five individuals rely on traditional medicine for their primary healthcare needs. Medicinal plants are endowed with diverse bioactive compounds to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) microbes. So far, a less thorough examination has been made in this regard. This study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening of selected medicinal plants against MDR microbes.In vitro experimental study was carried out to evaluate antimicrobial effects and phytochemical screening of Rumex abyssinicus, Cucumis pustulatus, Discopodium penninervium, Lippia adoensis, Euphorbia depauperata, Cirsium englerianum, and Polysphaeria aethiopica against MDR bacteria and fungi. Aqueous and 80% methanolic extraction methods were employed for extraction. The susceptibility test, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal or fungicidal concentration were measured using disc diffusion or broth micro-dilution as per the CLSI protocols.The 80% methanolic extraction method was a preferred method to aqueous. The phytochemical constituents identified were alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, phenolic, tannins, terpenoidss, and cardiac glycosides. The hydroalcoholic extract demonstrated an appreciable antimicrobial role against MDR microbes with an MIC value of 1.0-128.0μg/ml and 11-29mm inhibition zone (IZ) in diameter. Extracts obtained from C. englerianum and E. depauperata showed a significant IZ ranged of 26-29mm on MRSA and Streptococcus pyogenes. MDR E. coli and K. pneumoniae showed 12-25mm and 23-28mm IZ in diameter, respectively. T. mentagraphytes was susceptible to all tested extracts. Moreover, S. pyogenes and K. pneumoniae were found the most susceptible bacteria to C. englerianum. Cirsium englerianum, L. adoensis, D. penninervium, and R. abyssinicus demonstrated remarkable antifungal effect against C. albicans and T. mentagrophytes, while R. abyssinicus showed the leading antifungal effect with 32 to 64μg/ml MIC values.The plant extracts have shown appreciable antimicrobial activities comparable to the currently prescribed modern drugs tested. Accordingly, further studies on clinical efficacy trial, safety, toxicity and affordability analyses have to be instigated promptly, so as to head to the final step to synthesize precursor molecules for new effective antimicrobials."
https://openalex.org/W3138676815,"Background Nursing homes (NH) for the elderly have been particularly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic mainly due to their hosted vulnerable populations and poor outbreak preparedness. In Belgium, the medical humanitarian organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) implemented a support project for NH including training on infection prevention and control (IPC), (re)-organization of care, and psychosocial support for NH staff. As psychosocial and mental health needs of NH residents in times of Covid-19 are poorly understood and addressed, this study aimed to better understand these needs and how staff could respond accordingly. Methods A qualitative study adopting thematic content analysis. Eight focus group discussions with direct caring staff and 56 in-depth interviews with residents were conducted in eight purposively and conveniently selected NHs in Brussels, Belgium, June 2020. Results NH residents experienced losses of freedom, social life, autonomy, and recreational activities that deprived them of their basic psychological needs. This had a massive impact on their mental well-being expressed in feeling depressed, anxious, and frustrated as well as decreased meaning and quality of life. Staff felt unprepared for the challenges posed by the pandemic; lacking guidelines, personal protective equipment and clarity around organization of care. They were confronted with professional and ethical dilemmas, feeling ‘trapped’ between IPC and the residents’ wellbeing. They witnessed the detrimental effects of the measures imposed on their residents. Conclusion This study revealed the insights of residents’ and NH staff at the height of the early Covid-19 pandemic. Clearer outbreak plans, including psychosocial support, could have prevented the aggravated mental health conditions of both residents and staff. A holistic approach is needed in NHs in which tailor-made essential restrictive IPC measures are combined with psychosocial support measures to reduce the impact on residents’ mental health impact and to enhance their quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W3137972746,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Despite strong efforts that have been taking place to control the pandemic globally, the virus is on the rise in many countries. Hence, this study assessed the maternal health care services utilization amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in West Shoa zone, Central Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 844 pregnant women or those who gave birth in the last 6 months before the study. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence of significant associations, and an adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was employed for the strength and directions of association between the independent and outcome variables. A P-value of &lt;0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. The prevalence of maternal health service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic was 64.8%. The odds of maternal health service utilization was higher among mothers who had primary (AOR = 2.16, 95%CI: 1.29–3.60), secondary (AOR = 1.97, 95%CI: 1.13–3.44), and college and above education (AOR = 2.89, 95%CI: 1.34–6.22) than those who could not read and write. Besides, mothers who did travel 30–60 minutes (AOR = 0.37, 95%CI: 0.23–0.59) and 60-90minutes (AOR = 0.10, 95%CI: 0.05–0.19) to reach the health facility had a lower odds of maternal health service utilization than those who did travel &lt;30 minutes. Moreover, mothers who earn 1000–2000 (AOR = 3.10, 95%CI: 1.73–5.55) and &gt; 2000 birrs (AOR = 2.66 95%CI: 1.52–4.64) had higher odds of maternal health service utilization than those who earn &lt;500 birrs. Similarly, the odds of utilizing maternal health service were higher among mothers who did not fear COVID-19 infection (AOR = 2.79, 95%CI: 1.85–4.20), who had not had to request permission from husband to visit the health facility (AOR = 7.24, 95%CI: 2.65–19.75), who had practicedCOVID-19 prevention measure (AOR = 5.82, 95%CI: 3.87–8.75), and used face mask (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.28–3.31) than their counterpart. Empowering mothers and creating awareness on COVID-19 preventionis recommended to improve maternal health service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3041609935,"The constant phase element (CPE) is a capacitive element with a frequency-independent negative phase between current and voltage which interpolates between a capacitor and a resistor. It is used extensively to model the complexity of the physics in e.g. the bioimpedance and electrochemistry fields. There is also a similar element with a positive phase angle, and both the capacitive and inductive CPEs are members of the family of fractional circuit elements or fractance. The physical meaning of the CPE is only partially understood and many consider it an idealized circuit element. The goal here is to provide alternative equivalent circuits, which may give rise to better interpretations of the fractance. Both the capacitive and the inductive CPEs can be interpreted in the time-domain, where the impulse and step responses are temporal power laws. Here we show that the current impulse responses of the capacitive CPE is the same as that of a simple time-varying series RL-circuit where the inductor's value increases linearly with time. Similarly, the voltage response of the inductive CPE corresponds to that of a simple parallel RC circuit where the capacitor's value increases linearly with time. We use the Micro-Cap circuit simulation program, which can handle time-varying circuits, for independent verification. The simulation corresponds exactly to the expected response from the proposed equivalents within 0.1% error. The realization with time-varying components correlates with known time-varying properties in applications, and may lead to a better understanding of the link between CPE and applications."
https://openalex.org/W3136531864,"Background COVID-19 is characterized by a rapid change in the patient’s condition, with major changes occurring over a few days. We aimed to develop and evaluate an emergency system for monitoring patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where more severe patients stay in their homes. Methodology/Principal findings The system consists of the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient and the hospital unit, which enables the medical staff to telemonitor the patient’s condition and help to send medical recommendations. The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which is performed using a cell phone application. The hospital unit includes a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW ® environment that can provide a real-time monitoring of the oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), beats per minute (BPM), body temperature (BT), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Abnormal events may be fast and automatically identified. After the design details are described, the system is validated by a 30-day home monitoring study in 12 controls and 12 patients with COVID-19 presenting asymptomatic to mild disease. Patients presented reduced SpO 2 (p&lt;0.0001) and increased BPM values (p&lt;0.0001). Three patients (25%) presented PEF values between 50 and 80% of the predicted. Three of the 12 monitored patients presented events of desaturation (SpO 2 &lt;92%). The experimental results were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology, providing clear evidence that the proposed system can be a useful tool for the remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19. Conclusions An emergency system for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early abnormalities in these patients. This system may contribute to conserving hospital resources for those most in need while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under acute deterioration, requiring urgent assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3138012991,"Gridded population data is widely used to map fine scale population patterns and dynamics to understand associated human-environmental processes for global change research, disaster risk assessment and other domains. This study mapped gridded population across Germany using weighting layers from building density, building height (both from previous studies) and building type datasets, all created from freely available, temporally and globally consistent Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. We first produced and validated a nation-wide dataset of predominant residential and non-residential building types. We then examined the impact of different weighting layers from density, type and height on top-down dasymetric mapping quality across scales. We finally performed a nation-wide bottom-up population estimate based on the three datasets. We found that integrating building types into dasymetric mapping is helpful at fine scale, as population is not redistributed to non-residential areas. Building density improved the overall quality of population estimates at all scales compared to using a binary building layer. Most importantly, we found that the combined use of density and height, i.e. volume, considerably increased mapping quality in general and with regard to regional discrepancy by largely eliminating systematic underestimation in dense agglomerations and overestimation in rural areas. We also found that building density, type and volume, together with living floor area per capita, are suitable to produce accurate large-area bottom-up population estimates."
https://openalex.org/W3137111453,"Background Wildfires in California have become more deadly and destructive in recent years, and four of the ten most destructive fires occurred in 2017 and 2018. Through interviews with service providers, this article explores how these recent wildfires have impacted surrounding communities and the role various recovery resources have played in responding to the short- and long-term health and social needs of survivors. Methods Using a purposive sampling methodology, we interviewed 21 health and social service personnel who assisted in wildfire recovery efforts in California in 2017 and 2018. The study participants worked or volunteered in medical facilities, social services agencies and philanthropy/nonprofit organizations located in communities affected by wildfires. Participants were asked about three common, overarching themes that fire-impacted communities navigate post-disaster: health issues, social issues, and response and recovery resources. Inductive coding was used to identify common subthemes. Results The two most frequently discussed social issues during interviews were housing and employment access. Mental and emotional well-being and access to health resources were identified as being the most challenging health concerns that survivors face post-disaster. Participants also identified the following private and public recovery resources that survivors use to attempt to restabilize following the fire: community support, county agencies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA,) insurance companies and philanthropic organizations. However, participants noted that the cumulative impacts of these efforts still leave many of their patients and clients without the resources needed to restabilize emotionally, financially and physically. Finally, participants spoke about the community-wide, downstream impacts of wildfires, noting that “survivors” are not only those whose health is immediately compromised by the disaster. Conclusion Given the worsening wildfire seasons in California, we must increase our understanding of both the scope of the health and social issues that survivors navigate following a disaster, as well as the effectiveness and sustainability of recovery resources available to survivors. We must also understand the “ripple effect” that wildfires have on surrounding communalities, impacting housing access, social services, and health care access. More research and support, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic, is urgently needed to improve our ability to support the health and social needs of wildfire survivors in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3137541902,"Background To date, survival data on risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in western Europe is limited, and none of the published survival studies have used a competing risk approach. This study aims to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands, considering recovery as a competing risk. Methods In this observational multicenter cohort study we included adults with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that were admitted to one of five hospitals in the Netherlands (March to May 2020). We performed a competing risk survival analysis, presenting cause-specific hazard ratios (HR CS ) for the effect of preselected factors on the absolute risk of death and recovery. Results 1,006 patients were included (63.9% male; median age 69 years, IQR: 58–77). Patients were hospitalized for a median duration of 6 days (IQR: 3–13); 243 (24.6%) of them died, 689 (69.9%) recovered, and 74 (7.4%) were censored. Patients with higher age (HR CS 1.10, 95% CI 1.08–1.12), immunocompromised state (HR CS 1.46, 95% CI 1.08–1.98), who used anticoagulants or antiplatelet medication (HR CS 1.38, 95% CI 1.01–1.88), with higher modified early warning score (MEWS) (HR CS 1.09, 95% CI 1.01–1.18), and higher blood LDH at time of admission (HR CS 6.68, 95% CI 1.95–22.8) had increased risk of death, whereas fever (HR CS 0.70, 95% CI 0.52–0.95) decreased risk of death. We found no increased mortality risk in male patients, high BMI or diabetes. Conclusion Our competing risk survival analysis confirms specific risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in a the Netherlands, which can be used for prediction research, more intense in-hospital monitoring or prioritizing particular patients for new treatments or vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3136405434,"The aim of this study was at examining the validity and reliability of a marketed bioimpedance (BIA) scale for body composition assessment, in children engaged in an educational football project (FIFA 11 for Health). One-hundred and twenty-seven children (70 boys and 57 girls; age 10.7±0.5 years, body mass 41.2±9.0 kg, Body mass index 18.5±3.3 kg·m -2 and stature 149±7 cm) were evaluated for total body mass, lean body mass, muscle mass, using BIA (InBody 270, Biospace, California, USA) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, Lunar Prodigy, GE Medical Systems, Madison, Wisconsin, USA), at baseline conditions. Data analyses were carried out separately for girls and boys. Nearly perfect associations (r = 0.97−0.99) and excellent absolute (TEM = 0.04−1.9%) and relative (ICC = 0.98−1.00) inter-device reliability were found between DEXA and BIA variables. Fat and lean body mass bias (p &lt; .0001) were practically relevant both for the boys (2.56 and 11.22 kg, respectively) and the girls (2.33 and 10.49 kg, respectively). Muscle mass and body fat were underestimated and overestimated, respectively, for the boys and girls. InBody 270 is a valid BIA system for estimating body composition with an excellent inter-device relative and absolute reliability. However, the remarkable measurements bias of BIA fat and muscle mass values discourage its use for clinical prescription. The BIA body composition biases were sex dependent."
https://openalex.org/W3136706182,"Levels of activity are often affected in psychiatric disorders and can be core symptoms of illness. Advances in technology now allow the accurate assessment of activity levels but it remains unclear whether alterations in activity arise from shared risk factors for developing psychiatric disorders, such as genetics, or are better explained as consequences of the disorders and their associated factors. We aimed to examine objectively-measured physical activity in individuals with psychiatric disorders, and assess the role of genetic liability for psychiatric disorders on physical activity. Accelerometer data were available on 95,529 UK Biobank participants, including measures of overall mean activity and minutes per day of moderate activity, walking, sedentary activity, and sleep. Linear regressions measured associations between psychiatric diagnosis and activity levels, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for psychiatric disorders and activity levels. Genetic correlations were calculated between psychiatric disorders and different types of activity. Having a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was associated with reduced overall activity compared to unaffected controls. In individuals without a psychiatric disorder, reduced overall activity levels were associated with PRS for schizophrenia, depression, and ASD. ADHD PRS was associated with increased overall activity. Genetic correlations were consistent with PRS findings. Variation in physical activity is an important feature across psychiatric disorders. Whilst levels of activity are associated with genetic liability to psychiatric disorders to a very limited extent, the substantial differences in activity levels in those with psychiatric disorders most likely arise as a consequences of disorder-related factors."
https://openalex.org/W3138227896,"The artificial pancreas is a closed-loop insulin delivery system that automatically regulates glucose levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes. In-silico testing using simulation environments accelerates the development of better artificial pancreas systems. Simulation environments need an accurate model that captures glucose dynamics during exercise to simulate real-life scenarios. We proposed six variations of the Bergman Minimal Model to capture the physiological effects of moderate exercise on glucose dynamics in individuals with type 1 diabetes. We estimated the parameters of each model with clinical data using a Bayesian approach and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The data consisted of measurements of plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and oxygen consumption collected from a study of 17 adults with type 1 diabetes undergoing aerobic exercise sessions. We compared the models based on the physiological plausibility of their parameters estimates and the deviance information criterion. The best model features (i) an increase in glucose effectiveness proportional to exercise intensity, and (ii) an increase in insulin action proportional to exercise intensity and duration. We validated the selected model by reproducing results from two previous clinical studies. The selected model accurately simulates the physiological effects of moderate exercise on glucose dynamics in individuals with type 1 diabetes. This work offers an important tool to develop strategies for exercise management with the artificial pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W3136540382,"The aim of this study was to assess and compare the maximal force and rate of force development (RFD) between intermediate, advanced and elite climbers using several different methods for calculating RFD. Fifty-seven male climbers (17 intermediate, 25 advanced, and 15 elite) performed isometric pull-ups on a climbing-specific hold while the RFD was calculated using several absolute (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 ms from onset of force) and relative time periods (25, 50, 75, 95, and 100% of time to peak force). The maximal force was higher among elite climbers compared to advanced (ES = 1.78, p < 0.001) and intermediate climbers (ES = 1.77, p < 0.001), while no difference was observed between intermediate and advanced climbers (P = 0.898). The elite group also showed higher RFD than the other two groups at all relative time periods (ES = 1.02-1.58, p < 0.001-0.002), whereas the absolute time periods only revealed differences between the elite vs. the other groups at 50, 100 and 150 ms from the onset of force (ES = 0.72-0.84, p = 0.032-0.040). No differences in RFD were observed between the intermediate and advanced groups at any time period (p = 0.942-1.000). Maximal force and RFD, especially calculated using the longer periods of the force curve, may be used to distinguish elite climbers from advanced and intermediate climbers. The authors suggest using relative rather than absolute time periods when analyzing the RFD of climbers."
https://openalex.org/W3136911404,"Objectives We describe the strategy used to repair intraoperative leaks of various grades and define factors for preventing postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage (CSF) after surgery via the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach (EETA). Study design Retrospective chart review at a tertiary referral center. Methods Patients who underwent surgery via EETA from January 2009 to May 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Intraoperative CSF leakage was graded 0–3 in terms of the dural defect size; various repairs were used depending on the grade. Results A total of 777 patients underwent 869 operations via EETA; 609 (70.1%) experienced no intraoperative CSF leakage (grade 0) but 260 (29.9%) did. Leakage was of grade 1 in 135 cases (15.5%), grade 2 in 83 (9.6%), and grade 3 in 42 (4.8%). In 260 patients with intraoperative CSF leakage, a buttress was wedged into the sellar defect site in 178 cases (68.5%) and a pedicled flap was placed in 105 cases (40.4%). Autologous fat (108 cases, 41.5%) and a synthetic dural substitute (91 cases, 35%) were used to fill the dead space of the sellar resection cavity. Postoperative CSF leakage developed in 21 patients: 6 of grade 1, 7 of grade 2, and 8 of grade 3. Buttress placement significantly decreased postoperative leakage in grade 1 patients (p = 0.041). In patients of perioperative leakage grades 2 and 3, postoperative CSF leakage was significantly reduced only when both fat and a buttress were applied (p = 0.042 and p = 0.043, respectively). Conclusion A buttress prevented postoperative CSF leakage in grade 1 patients; both fat and buttress were required by patients with intraoperative leakage of grades 2 and 3."
https://openalex.org/W3137533157,"Among over 200 COVID-19 affected countries, some are fighting to “flatten the curve”, while some others are considering reopening after lockdown. It remains unclear how different reopening strategies obstruct the local virus containment and impact the economy. We develop a model with travelers across heterogeneous epicenters. A low-risk area attempts to safely reopen utilizing internal policies, such as social distancing and contact tracing, and external policies, including capacity quota, quarantine, and tests. Simulations based on the COVID-19 scenario show that external policies differ in efficacy. They can substitute each other and complement internal policies. Simultaneous relaxation of both channels may lead to a new wave of COVID-19 and large economic costs. This work highlights the importance of quantitative assessment prior to implementing reopening strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3137988546,"Background Cervical cancer remains one of the major public health challenges in low and middle-income countries including Ethiopia. There was a scarce of evidence regarding the effect of woman’s socio-demographic characteristics and body mass index on the development of precancerous cervical lesions in Ethiopia. Therefore, the current study aimed at identifying the risk factors of precancerous cervical lesions among women visiting referral hospitals for cervical cancer screening in Amhara national regional state. Methods A hospital-based case-control study was conducted from 22 December 2019 to 8 April 2020 among 200 women including 67 visual inspections with acetic acid (VIA) positive women (i.e., cases) and 133 visual inspections with acetic acid (VIA) negative women (i.e., controls). The study was conducted at randomly selected referral hospitals in Amhara national regional state. Data were collected mainly through face to face interview and chart review using structured questionnaire and checklist respectively. Data were then entered to EpiData version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Binary logistic regression model was fitted and variables with p-value of &lt; 0.2 at bivariable logistic regression analysis were candidates for the multivariable analysis. Level of significance was claimed based on adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) at p-value of ≤ 0.05. Results This study illustrates that the odds of being positive for precancerous cervical lesion (PCL) were higher among women who had body mass index (BMI) of &lt;18.5 kg/m2 (AOR = 3.83; 95% CI: 1.26, 8.76), early coitarche (AOR = 3.15; 95% CI: 1.50, 11.49, history of using oral contraceptive pills (AOR = 2.74; 95% CI: 1.6, 7.4), lifetime sexual transmitted infections (AOR = 3.73; 95% CI: 2.5, 12.28) and multiple sexual partners (AOR = 3.23; 95% CI: 1.82, 9.29). On the other hand, participants’ BMI of ≥25 kg/m2 (AOR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.75) and level of education of college and above (AOR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.77) were identified to be protective factors of PCL. Conclusion Most of the determinants of precancerous cervical lesions were modifiable and mainly related to women’s socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors and body mass index. Therefore, strengthening awareness on safe sexual practices and healthy life styles through information, education and communication (IEC), and behavioral change communication (BCC) would decrease the incidence of precancerous cervical lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3138979742,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) and cooccurring changes in ocular biometry parameters on the corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) speckle distribution in ex-vivo experiments on porcine intact eyes. Twenty-three eyeballs were used in the inflation test where IOP in the anterior chamber was precisely set from 10 mmHg to 40 mmHg in steps of 5 mmHg and where eye biometry was utilized (IOL Master 700). To assess the influence of the duration of the experiment on the OCT speckle statistics, the second experiment was performed with 10 eyeballs at the constant IOP of 15 mmHg. Based on the OCT scans of central cornea (Copernicus REVO), spatial maps of the scale parameter (a) and the shape parameter (v) of the gamma distribution speckle model were estimated. The means of both parameters for each spatial map were computed within the 2 mm of the central stroma. Both distributional parameters statistically significantly varied with IOP and time (one way repeated measures ANOVA, all p-values < 0.001). The a parameter revealed a faster statistically significant increase in IOP up to 25 mmHg, regardless of time. Central corneal thickness (CCT), the anterior chamber depth, and the mean equivalent spherical power varied significantly with IOP, whereas CCT and axial length changed statistically significantly with time. Statistically significant correlation was found between CCT and the a parameter, after removing IOP as a confounding factor (r = -0.576, p < 0.001). The parameters of the gamma distribution can be used not only for identifying IOP induced changes in the optical scattering within the corneal stroma, but also in corneal geometry. The approach of corneal speckle analysis could be potentially utilized for an indirect and noninvasive assessment of some properties of corneal stroma."
https://openalex.org/W3136537486,A numerical approach is presented to efficiently simulate time-resolved 3D phase-contrast Magnetic resonance Imaging (or 4D Flow MRI) acquisitions under realistic flow conditions. The Navier-Stokes and Bloch equations are simultaneously solved with an Eulerian-Lagrangian formalism. A semi-analytic solution for the Bloch equations as well as a periodic particle seeding strategy are developed to reduce the computational cost. The velocity reconstruction pipeline is first validated by considering a Poiseuille flow configuration. The 4D Flow MRI simulation procedure is then applied to the flow within an in vitro flow phantom typical of the cardiovascular system. The simulated MR velocity images compare favorably to both the flow computed by solving the Navier-Stokes equations and experimental 4D Flow MRI measurements. A practical application is finally presented in which the MRI simulation framework is used to identify the origins of the MRI measurement errors.
https://openalex.org/W3138294516,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder exhibiting Mendelian inheritance in some families. Next-generation sequencing approaches, including whole exome sequencing (WES), have revolutionized the field of Mendelian disorders and have identified a number of PD genes. We recruited a South African family with autosomal dominant PD and used WES to identify a possible pathogenic mutation. After filtration and prioritization, we found five potential causative variants in CFAP65, RTF1, NRXN2, TEP1 and CCNF. The variant in NRXN2 was selected for further analysis based on consistent prediction of deleteriousness across computational tools, not being present in unaffected family members, ethnic-matched controls or public databases, and its expression in the substantia nigra. A protein model for NRNX2 was created which provided a three-dimensional (3D) structure that satisfied qualitative mean and global model quality assessment scores. Trajectory analysis showed destabilizing effects of the variant on protein structure, indicated by high flexibility of the LNS-6 domain adopting an extended conformation. We also found that the known substrate N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) contributed to restoration of the structural stability of mutant NRXN2. If NRXN2 is indeed found to be the causal gene, this could reveal a new mechanism for the pathobiology of PD."
https://openalex.org/W3138797820,"Transmembrane transport of l-lactate by members of the monocarboxylate transporter family, MCT, is vital in human physiology and a malignancy factor in cancer. Interaction with an accessory protein, typically basigin, is required to deliver the MCT to the plasma membrane. It is unknown whether basigin additionally exerts direct effects on the transmembrane l-lactate transport of MCT1. Here, we show that the presence of basigin leads to an intracellular accumulation of l-lactate 4.5-fold above the substrate/proton concentrations provided by the external buffer. Using basigin truncations we localized the effect to arise from the extracellular Ig-I domain. Identification of surface patches of condensed opposite electrostatic potential, and experimental analysis of charge-affecting Ig-I mutants indicated a bivalent harvesting antenna functionality for both, protons and substrate anions. From these data, and determinations of the cytosolic pH with a fluorescent probe, we conclude that the basigin Ig-I domain drives lactate uptake by locally increasing the proton and substrate concentration at the extracellular MCT entry site. The biophysical properties are physiologically relevant as cell growth on lactate media was strongly promoted in the presence of the Ig-I domain. Lack of the domain due to shedding, or misfolding due to breakage of a stabilizing disulfide bridge reversed the effect. Tumor progression according to classical or reverse Warburg effects depends on the transmembrane l-lactate distribution, and this study shows that the basigin Ig-I domain is a pivotal determinant."
https://openalex.org/W3136864045,"Several shrimp trawl fisheries use a Nordmöre sorting grid to avoid bycatch of fish. However, small fish can pass through the grid. Therefore, the retention of juvenile fish often remains an issue during shrimp trawling. We investigated the vertical distribution of deepwater shrimp ( Pandalus borealis ) and dominant bycatch species at the point where the Nordmöre grid section is installed. This was achieved using a separator frame which split the net vertically into three compartments of equal entry size. Our results showed that shrimp predominately follow the lower part of the trawl belly, whereas species such as redfish ( Sebastes spp .), cod ( Gadus morhua ), polar cod ( Boreogadus saida ) and American plaice ( Hippoglossoides platessoides ) preferred the mid-section in the aft of the trawl. Haddock ( Melanogrammus aeglefinus ) primarily entered through the upper section of the trawl belly. Using these results, we predict that a vertical separation device installed forward of a 19 mm Nordmöre grid combined with a 35 mm codend would result in a significant reduction in bycatch with only minor loss of shrimp."
https://openalex.org/W3137119862,"During influenza epidemics, Japanese clinicians routinely conduct rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) in patients with influenza-like illness, and patients with positive test results are treated with anti-influenza drugs within 48 h after the onset of illness. We assessed the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children (6 months–15 years old, N = 4243), using a test-negative case-control design based on the results of RIDTs in the 2018/19 season. The VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm and A(H3N2) was analyzed separately using an RIDT kit specifically for detecting A(H1N1)pdm09. The adjusted VE against combined influenza A (H1N1pdm and H3N2) and against A(H1N1)pdm09 was 39% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30%–46%) and 74% (95% CI, 39%–89%), respectively. By contrast, the VE against non-A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza A (presumed to be H3N2) was very low at 7%. The adjusted VE for preventing hospitalization was 56% (95% CI, 16%–77%) against influenza A. The VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 was consistently high in our studies. By contrast, the VE against A(H3N2) was low not only in adults but also in children in the 2018/19 season."
https://openalex.org/W3136681110,"Grass pollen allergens are known to be one of the major triggers of hay fever with an increasing number of humans affected by pollen associated health impacts. Climate change characterized by increasing air temperature and more frequent drought periods might affect plant development and pollen characteristics. In this study a one-year (2017) field experiment was conducted in Bavaria, Germany, simulating drought by excluding rain and elevated air temperature by installing a heating system to investigate their effects primarily on the allergenic potential of eight selected cultivars of the two grass species timothy and perennial ryegrass. It could be shown for timothy that especially under drought and heat conditions the allergen content is significantly lower accompanied by a decrease in pollen weight and protein content. In perennial ryegrass the response to drought and heat conditions in terms of allergen content, pollen weight, and protein content was more dependent on the respective cultivar probably due to varying requirements for their growth conditions and tolerance to drought and heat. Results support recommendations which cultivars should be grown preferentially. The optimal choice of grass species and respective cultivars under changing climate conditions should be a major key aspect for the public health sector in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3136797307,"Aloe vera has been widely used in health and nutritional supplements in Chinese herbal medicine. Furthermore, Aloe vera production has been an emerging industry for making cosmetics and functional food. However, the reported adverse effects raised questions as to whether Aloe vera and its products were safe enough to be used in medicine and health care. In view of this, the safety evaluation of Aloe vera products before marketing is very important. The present study aimed to assess the toxicological profile of Aloe vera soft capsule (ASC), through acute, subacute toxicity and genotoxicity tests. Male and female ICR mice were received by oral gavage 15000 mg/kg bodyweight of ASC in the acute toxicity test. Male and female SD rats were fed on diet blended with different doses of ASC (equivalent to 832.5, 1665 and 3330 mg/kg bodyweight of ASC) for the subacute toxicity test. In the acute toxicity study, no mortality or behavioral changes were observed, indicating the LD 50 was higher than 15000 mg/kg bodyweight. In the subacute toxicity test, no significant changes were observed in bodyweight, food consumption, hematological, biochemical or histopathological parameters in the rats exposed. These data suggested that ASC used in this study did not produce any marked subacute toxic effects up to a maximum concentration of 3330 mg/kg bodyweight. In the genotoxicity study, ASC showed no mutagenic activity in the Ames test and no evidence of potential to induce bone marrow micronucleus or testicular chromosome aberrations in ICR mice exposed to 10000 mg/kg bodyweight. Collectively, ASC could be considered safe before it was marketed as a laxative and moistening health food."
https://openalex.org/W3136967100,"Breast cancer prognosis is frequently good but a substantial number of patients suffer from relapse. The death receptor ligand TRAIL can in combination with Smac mimetics induce apoptosis in some luminal-like ER-positive breast cancer cell lines, such as CAMA-1, but not in MCF-7 cells. Here we show that TRAIL and the Smac mimetic LCL161 induce non-canonical NF-κB and IFN signaling in ER-positive MCF-7 cells and in CAMA-1 breast cancer cells when apoptosis is blocked by caspase inhibition. Levels of p52 are increased and STAT1 gets phosphorylated. STAT1 phosphorylation is induced by TRAIL alone in MCF-7 cells and is independent of non-canonical NF-κB since downregulation of NIK has no effect. The phosphorylation of STAT1 is a rather late event, appearing after 24 hours of TRAIL stimulation. It is preceded by an increase in IFNB1 mRNA levels and can be blocked by siRNA targeting the type I IFN receptor IFNAR1 and by inhibition of Janus kinases by Ruxolitinib. Moreover, downregulation of caspase-8, but not inhibition of caspase activity, blocks TRAIL-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation and induction of IFN-related genes. The data suggest that TRAIL-induced IFNB1 expression in MCF-7 cells is dependent on a non-apoptotic role of caspase-8 and leads to autocrine interferon-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3137607856,"Background Postpartum women have high rates of unmet need for modern contraception in the two years following birth in Nepal. We assessed whether providing contraceptive counseling during pregnancy and/or prior to discharge from the hospital for birth or after discharge from the hospital for birth was associated with reduced postpartum unmet need in Nepal. Methods We used data from a larger a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized trial, including contraceptive counselling in six tertiary hospitals. Group 1 hospitals (three hospitals) initiated the intervention after three months of baseline data collection, while Group 2 hospitals (three hospitals) initiated the same intervention after nine months. We have enrolled 21,280 women in the baseline interviews and conducted two follow-up interviews with them, one and two years after they had delivered in one of our study hospitals. We estimated the effect of counseling and its timing (pre-discharge, post- discharge, both, or neither) on unmet need for modern contraception in the postpartum period, using random-effects logistic regressions. Results Unmet need for modern contraception was high (54% at one year and 50% at two years). Women counseled in either the pre-discharge period (Odds ratio [OR] 0·86; 95% CI: 0·80, 0·93) or in the post-discharge period (OR 0·86; 95% CI: 0·79, 0·93) were less likely to have an unmet need in the postpartum period compared to women with no counseling. However, women who received counseling in both the pre- and post-discharge period were 27% less likely than women who had not received counseling to have unmet need (OR 0.73; 95% CI: 0·67, 0·80). Conclusions Counseling women either before or after discharge reduces unmet need for postpartum contraception but counseling in both periods is most effective."
https://openalex.org/W3137970099,"Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) is the etiological agent of leprosy, and the skin lesions of lepromatous leprosy are filled with numerous foamy or xanthomatous histiocytes that are parasitized by M. leprae. Lipids are an important nutrient for the intracellular survival of M. leprae. In this study, we attempted to determine the intracellular lipid composition and underlying mechanisms for changes in host cell lipid metabolism induced by M. leprae infection. Using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), we demonstrated specific induction of triacylglycerol (TAG) production in human macrophage THP-1 cells following M. leprae infection. We then used [14C] stearic acid tracing to show incorporation of this newly synthesized host cell TAG into M. leprae. In parallel with TAG accumulation, expression of host glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3 (GPAT3), a key enzyme in de novo TAG synthesis, was significantly increased in M. leprae-infected cells. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of GPAT3 in THP-1 cells (GPAT3 KO) dramatically reduced accumulation of TAG following M. leprae infection, intracellular mycobacterial load, and bacteria viability. These results together suggest that M. leprae induces host GPAT3 expression to facilitate TAG accumulation within macrophages to maintain a suitable environment that is crucial for intracellular survival of these bacilli."
https://openalex.org/W3138765973,"We have examined the effects of intravenous (IV) delivery of rAAVrh74.MHCK7. GALGT2 in the golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). After baseline testing, GRMD dogs were treated at 3 months of age and reassessed at 6 months. This 3–6 month age range is a period of rapid disease progression, thus offering a relatively short window to establish treatment efficacy. Measures analyzed included muscle AAV transduction, GALGT2 transgene expression, GALGT2 -induced glycosylation, muscle pathology, and muscle function. A total of five dogs were treated, 4 at 2x10 14 vg/kg and one at 6x10 14 vgkg. The 2x10 14 vg/kg dose led to transduction of regions of the heart with 1–3 vector genomes (vg) per nucleus, while most skeletal muscles were transduced with 0.25–0.5vg/nucleus. GALGT2 -induced glycosylation paralleled levels of myofiber vg transduction, with about 90% of cardiomyocytes having increased glycosylation versus 20–35% of all myofibers across the skeletal muscles tested. Conclusions from phenotypic testing were limited by the small number of dogs. Treated dogs had less pronounced fibrosis and overall lesion severity when compared to control groups, but surprisingly no significant changes in limb muscle function measures. GALGT2 -treated skeletal muscle and heart had elevated levels of utrophin protein expression and GALGT2 -induced expression of glycosylated α dystroglycan, providing further evidence of a treatment effect. Serum chemistry, hematology, and cardiac function measures were largely unchanged by treatment. Cumulatively, these data show that short-term intravenous treatment of GRMD dogs with rAAVrh74.MHCK7. GALGT2 at high doses can induce muscle glycosylation and utrophin expression and may be safe over a short 3-month interval, but that such treatments had only modest effects on muscle pathology and did not significantly improve muscle strength."
https://openalex.org/W3139079499,"Identifying psychological correlates of children's physical activity intentions may signpost potentially modifiable targets for interventions aimed at promoting physical activity participation. School recess and leisure-time outside of school are appropriate contexts in which such interventions may be delivered. However, few studies have identified correlates of physical activity intentions in these environments. Examining correlates in these contexts may provide formative evidence on which to base interventions to promote physical activity.The current study adopted an integrated theoretical model to test relations between motivational constructs from self-determination theory, social cognition constructs from the theory of planned behavior, and physical activity intentions in leisure-time and school recess contexts.Finnish school children (N = 845, M age = 13.93, SD = 0.99) from three lower-secondary schools completed self-report measures of perceived autonomy support by peers, autonomous and controlled motivation, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and physical activity intentions for both contexts.Well-fitting structural equation models controlling for past behavior indicated that autonomous motivation in the school recess context and attitude in both contexts were the most pervasive predictors of physical activity intentions, and mediated the relationship between perceived autonomy support and intentions. Multi-group analyses supported invariance of the models in both contexts across gender, grades, and school, with few variations.The current study supports relations between motivational and social cognition correlates of children's physical activity intentions in school recess and leisure-time contexts. Future research should extend these findings to the prediction of follow-up participation in physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W3135975049,"Background Heart Failure (HF) is the most common cause of death in Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA), an inherited mitochondrial disease. Myocardial fibrosis and myocardial hypertrophy are well-documented autopsy features among FRDA patients with HF. Objectives To leverage the unique tissue characterization features of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for characterizing myocardial remodeling in patients with genetically confirmed FRDA without HF and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF &gt; 55%). Methods Twenty-seven FRDA’s patients (age 27.6 ± 9.7 years, 15 women) and 10 healthy controls (32.6±7.3 years, 5 women) underwent a CMR for assessment of LV function, myocardial T1, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), extracellular volume fraction (ECV), and intracellular water-lifetime (τ ic ), a marker of cardiomyocyte size. Results As compared to controls, FRDA patients had a preserved LVEF (LVEF: 70.5±7.4% vs. 63.9±9.0%, P&lt;0.058), larger LV mass index (LVMASSi: 61±21.7 vs. 45±4.2g/m 2 , P&lt;0.02), and decreased LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi 53.1±12.0 vs. 75.7±16.1ml/m 2 , P&lt;0.001), compared with controls. Additionally, ECV and cardiomyocyte size (τ ic ,) were larger in FRDA patients (ECV: 0.36 ±0.05 vs. 0.25±0.02, P&lt;0.001; τ ic : 0.15±0.08 vs. 0.06±0.03 s, P = 0.02). ECV and τ ic were positively associated with LV mass-to-volume ratio (ECV: r = 0.57, P = 0.003; τ ic : r = 0.39; P = 0.05). LVMASSi and cardiomyocyte mass-index [(1−ECV)·LVMASSi] declined with age at the CMR exam, independent of the age at initial diagnosis. Conclusions LV hypertrophy and concentric LV remodeling in FRDA are associated at the tissue level with an expansion of the ECV and an increase in cardiomyocyte size. The adverse tissue remodeling assessed by ECV and τ ic is associated with more severe cardiomyopathy classification, suggesting a role for these markers in tracking disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3136328896,"Objectives Collection and storage of biospecimens and data for biobanking raise many ethical concerns. Stakeholders’ opinions about these ethical issues are important since they can help in the development of ethical guidelines to govern biobanking activities. Physicians are among the important stakeholders since they contact potential participants and could be biobank users. The goal of this study is to evaluate the perceptions and attitude of Egyptian physicians towards ethical issues in biobanking. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was designed and distributed with the target group between November 2019 and January 2020. Results The questionnaire was completed by 223 physicians. While 65.5% reported hearing the term ""Biobanking"" before, 45.7% knew that there are biobanks in Egypt. Participants had a general positive attitude towards the value of biobanks in research. About 73% agreed that biobanks can share biospecimens with international research organizations, but only 42.6% supported collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, and 44% agreed to the use of user fees by biobanks. About 48% supported the use of broad consent in biobanks, and 73.1% believed that donors of biospecimens should be informed about results of research performed on their biospecimens. Conclusion Although many Egyptian physicians heard about biobanking, they had limited knowledge about the existence of biobanks in Egypt. They had concerns about commercialization, use of broad consent and user fees. A knowledge gap exists among these stakeholders, which should be covered by different educational activities. Community discussions should start to reach consensus about the issues of commercialization and return of research results."
https://openalex.org/W3136739351,"Oral mucositis (OM) is a common, painful side effect of radiation therapy used for the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC). Activation of the innate immune system upon irradiation has been identified as a key precipitating event of OM. To better understand OM's pathogenesis, we studied pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and their downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines in a mouse model of radiation-induced OM. We also tested therapeutic efficacy of GM-1111 that targets innate immune system to reduce radiation-induced OM.The pathogenesis of OM was studied in a single X-ray induced mouse model. The severity of OM was measured by visual and microscopical examinations. The irradiation-induced changes of PRRs and their downstream effector cytokine gene expression levels were determined. The efficacy of GM-1111 to reduce OM was tested in single and fractionated irradiation mouse models. The impact of the drug on tumor response to radiation therapy was also tested in a mouse model of human HNC.Radiation-induced tissue ulcerations were radiation-dosage and -time dependent. The lesions showed selective increases in PRR and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression levels. Once daily administration of GM-1111 (≥30 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly reduced the severity and the incidence of OM. The drug had little effect on PRRs but significantly inhibited downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. GM-1111 did not interfere radiation therapy to induce HNC SCC-25 tumor regression. Instead, we observed significant drug-induced tumor regression.Radiation induces tissue damages. The increased expression levels of PRRs and their downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine genes in the damaged tissues suggest their important contribution to the pathogenesis of OM. Drug GM-1111 that targets these innate immune molecules may be a potential drug candidate as an intervention for OM."
https://openalex.org/W3136884202,"Background A key component of the WHO End TB Strategy is quality of care, for which case fatality is a critical marker. Half of India’s nearly 3 million TB patients are treated in the highly unregulated private sector, yet little is known about the outcomes of these patients. Using a retrospective cohort design, we estimated the case fatality ratio (CFR) and rate of recurrent TB among patients managed in the private healthcare sector in Patna, India. Methods World Health Partners’ Private Provider Interface Agencies (PPIA) pilot project in Patna has treated 89,906 private sector TB patients since 2013. A random sample of 4,000 patients treated from 2014 to 2016 were surveyed in 2018 for case fatality and recurrent TB. CFR is defined as the proportion of patients who die during the period of interest. Treatment CFRs, post-treatment CFRs and rates of recurrent TB were estimated. Predictors for fatality and recurrence were identified using Cox proportional hazards modelling. Survey non-response was adjusted for using inverse probability selection weighting. Results The survey response rate was 56.0%. The weighted average follow-up times were 8.7 months in the treatment phase and 26.4 months in the post-treatment phase. Unobserved patients were more likely to have less than one month of treatment adherence (32.0% vs. 13.5%) and were more likely to live in rural Patna (21.9% vs. 15.0%). The adjusted treatment phase CFR was 7.27% (5.97%, 8.49%) and at 24 months post-treatment was 3.32% (2.36%, 4.42%). The adjusted 24 month post-treatment phase recurrent TB rate was 3.56% (2.54%, 4.79%). Conclusions Our cohort study provides critical estimates of TB patient outcomes in the Indian private sector, and accounts for selection bias. Patients in the private sector in Patna experienced a moderate treatment CFR but rates of recurrent TB and post-treatment fatality were low."
https://openalex.org/W3137376507,"Novel antiviral agents for influenza, which poses a substantial threat to humans, are required. Cyclobakuchiols A and B have been isolated from Psoralea glandulosa, and cyclobakuchiol C has been isolated from P. corylifolia. The structural differences between cyclobakuchiol A and C arise due to the oxidation state of isopropyl group, and these compounds can be derived from (+)-(S)-bakuchiol, a phenolic isoprenoid compound present in P. corylifolia seeds. We previously reported that bakuchiol induces enantiospecific anti-influenza A virus activity involving nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. However, it remains unclear whether cyclobakuchiols A-C induce anti-influenza A virus activity. In this study, cyclobakuchiols A, B, and C along with cyclobakuchiol D, a new artificial compound derived from cyclobakuchiol B, were synthesized and examined for their anti-influenza A virus activities using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. As a result, cyclobakuchiols A-D were found to inhibit influenza A viral infection, growth, and the reduction of expression of viral mRNAs and proteins in influenza A virus-infected cells. Additionally, these compounds markedly reduced the mRNA expression of the host cell influenza A virus-induced immune response genes, interferon-β and myxovirus-resistant protein 1. In addition, cyclobakuchiols A-D upregulated the mRNA levels of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1, an Nrf2-induced gene, in influenza A virus-infected cells. Notably, cyclobakuchiols A, B, and C, but not D, induced the Nrf2 activation pathway. These findings demonstrate that cyclobakuchiols have anti-influenza viral activity involving host cell oxidative stress response. In addition, our results suggest that the suitably spatial configuration between oxidized isopropyl group and phenol moiety in the structure of cyclobakuchiols is required for their effect."
https://openalex.org/W3138402636,"Severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes corona virus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since led to a global pandemic. Importations of SARS-CoV-2 to Israel in late February from multiple countries initiated a rapid outbreak across the country. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes were sequenced from 59 imported samples with a recorded country of importation and 101 early circulating samples in February to mid-March 2020 and analyzed to infer clades and mutational patterns with additional sequences identified Israel available in public databases. Recorded importations in February to mid-March, mostly from Europe, led to multiple transmissions in all districts in Israel. Although all SARS-CoV-2 defined clades were imported, clade 20C became the dominating clade in the circulating samples. Identification of novel, frequently altered mutated positions correlating with clade-defining positions provide data for surveillance of this evolving pandemic and spread of specific clades of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and mutate in Israel and across the globe. With economy and travel resuming, surveillance of clades and accumulating mutations is crucial for understanding its evolution and spread patterns and may aid in decision making concerning public health issues."
https://openalex.org/W3139354411,"This study aimed to predict the impacts of shorter duration treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) on both MDR-TB percentage among new cases and overall MDR-TB cases in the WHO Southeast Asia Region. A deterministic compartmental model was constructed to describe both the transmission of TB and the MDR-TB situation in the Southeast Asia region. The population-level impacts of short-course treatment regimens were compared with the impacts of conventional regimens. Multi-way analysis was used to evaluate the impact by varying programmatic factors (eligibility for short-course MDR-TB treatment, treatment initiation, and drug susceptibility test (DST) coverage). The model predicted that overall TB incidence will be reduced from 246 (95% credible intervals (CrI), 221-275) per 100,000 population in 2020 to 239 (95% CrI, 215-267) per 100,000 population in 2035, with a modest reduction of 2.8% (95% CrI, 2.7%-2.9%). Despite the slight reduction in overall TB infections, the model predicted that the MDR-TB percentage among newly notified TB infections will remain steady, with 2.4% (95% CrI, 2.1-2.9) in 2020 and 2.5% (95% CrI, 2.3-3.1) in 2035, using conventional MDR-TB treatment. With the introduction of short-course regimens to treat MDR-TB, the development of resistance can be slowed by 38.6% (95% confidence intervals (CI), 35.9-41.3) reduction in MDR-TB case number, and 37.6% (95% CI, 34.9-40.3) reduction in MDR-TB percentage among new TB infections over the 30-year period compared with the baseline using the standard treatment regimen. The multi-way analysis showed eligibility for short-course treatment and treatment initiation greatly influenced the impacts of short-course treatment regimens on reductions in MDR-TB cases and percentage resistance among new infections. Policies which promote the expansion of short-course regimens and early MDR-TB treatment initiation should be considered along with other interventions to tackle antimicrobial resistance in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3135929132,"Long-term, large-scale perspectives are necessary for understanding climate variability and its effects on ecosystems and cultures. Tree ring records of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA) have documented major hydroclimatic variability during the last millennium in the American West, but fewer continuous, high-resolution hydroclimate records of the MCA-LIA period are available for eastern North America, particularly during the transition from the MCA to the LIA (ca. A.D. 1250–1400). Diatoms (micro-algae with silica cell walls) in sediment cores from three Adirondack (NY, USA) lakes and a hiatus in a wetland peat deposit in the Adirondack uplands provide novel insights into the late Holocene hydroclimate history of the Northeast. These records demonstrate that two of the region’s most extreme decadal-scale droughts of the last millennium occurred ca. A.D. 1260–1330 and ca. A.D. 1360–1390 during a dry-wet-dry (DWD) oscillation in the Adirondacks that contributed to forest fires and desiccation of wetlands in New York and Maine. The bimodal drying was probably related to more extreme droughts farther west and coincided with major events in Iroquoian and Abenaki cultural history. Although the causes of the DWD oscillation in the Adirondacks remain uncertain, changing sea-surface temperatures and solar variability are likely to have played a role."
https://openalex.org/W3137173858,"Background Although under-five (U5) mortality in Uganda has dropped over the past two decades, rates in urban slum neighborhoods remain high. As part of a broader verbal and social autopsy study of U5 deaths, this study explored the perspectives of volunteer community health workers, called Village Health Teams (VHTs), on why children under five in Kampala’s informal settlements are still dying despite living in close proximity to nearby health facilities. Methods This exploratory, qualitative study took place between January and March 2020 in the Rubaga division of Kampala, Uganda. VHTs from the slums of Kawaala and Nankulabye parishes, both located near a large government health center, were interviewed by a trained local interviewer to determine their perceptions of barriers to care-seeking and attribution for U5 childhood deaths. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed into English, imported into NVivo V 12.0 and thematically analyzed using the Attride-Stirling framework. Results 20 VHTs were interviewed, yielding two global themes, the first focusing on VHTs perceptions of their role in the community to promote positive health outcomes, and the second focusing on VHTs’ perceptions of how prompt care-seeking is disincentivized. Within the latter theme, three inter-related sub-themes emerged: disincentives for care-seeking at the health system level , which can drive negative beliefs held by families about the health system , and in turn, drive incentives for alternative health behaviors , which manifest as “incentivized delays” to care-seeking. Discussion This study illustrates VHT perspectives on the complex interactions between health system disincentives and the attitudes and behaviors of families with a sick child, as well as the reinforcing nature of these factors. Findings suggest a need for multi-pronged approaches that sensitize community members, engage community and health system leadership, and hold providers accountable for providing high-quality care. VHTs have enormous potential to foster improvement if given adequate resources, training, and support."

However, the cost and persistence of antimigraine drugs in Asian countries have not been well-studied. Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the treatment cost and persistence among migraineurs in Pakistan.Data from prescriptions collected from migraineurs who visited the Outpatient Department (OPD) of different public and private sector tertiary-care hospitals of Karachi, Pakistan were used to conduct this retrospective cohort study from 2017 to 2019. The minimum follow up period for each migraineur was about 12 months for persistence analysis while dropped-out patients data were also included in survival analysis as right censored data. Pairwise comparisons from Cox regression/hazards ratio were used to assess the predictors of persistence with the reference category of non-binary variables i.e. hazard ratio = 1 for low frequency migraineurs and NSAIDs users. Persistence with anti-migraine drugs was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier curve along with the Log Rank test.A total of 1597 patients were included in this study, 729 (45.6%) were male and 868 (54.3%) were female. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most prescribed class of drug initially for all classes of migraineurs (26.1%). Of them, 57.3% of migraineurs discontinued their treatment, 28.5% continued while 14.8% were switched to other treatment approaches. Persistence with initial treatment was more profound in female (58.8%) patients compared to males while the median age of continuers was 31 years. The total cost of migraine treatment in the entire study cohort was 297532.5 Pakistani Rupees ($1901.1). By estimating the hazard ratios (HR) using the Cox regression analysis, it can be observed that patients with high frequency (HR, 1.628; 95%CI, 1.221-2.179; p<0.0001) migraine, depression (HR, 1.268; 95%CI, 1.084-1.458; p<0.0001), increasing age (HR, 1.293; 95%CI, 1.092-1.458; p<0.0001), combination analgesics (HR, 1.817; 95%CI, 0.841-2.725; p = 0.0004) and prophylaxis drugs (HR, 1.314; 95%CI, 0.958-1.424; p<0.0001) users were at a higher risk of treatment discontinuation. However, patients with chronic migraine (HR, 0.881; 95%CI, 0.762-0.912; p = 0.0002), epileptic seizure (HR, 0.922; 95%CI, 0.654-1.206; p = 0.0002), other comorbidities (HR, 0.671; 95%CI, 0.352-1.011; p = 0.0003) and users of triptan(s) (HR, 0.701; 95%CI, 0.182-1.414; p = 0.0005) and triptan(s) with NSAIDs (HR, 0.758; 95%CI, 0.501-1.289; p<0.0001) had more chances to continue their initial therapy.Similar to western countries, the majority of migraineurs exhibited poor persistence to migraine treatments.

Driven by alcohol misuse, ALD is often reversible by cessation of consumption. However, abstinence programs can have limited success at curtailing abuse, and the loss of life. ALD, therefore, remains a significant clinical challenge. There is a need for effective treatments that prevent or reverse alcohol-induced liver damage to complement or supplant behavioral interventions. Metabolic syndrome, which is disproportionally prevalent in ALD patients, accelerates the progression of ALD and increases liver disease mortality. Current rodent models of ALD unfortunately do not account for the contribution of the western diet to ALD pathology. To address this, we have developed a rodent model of ALD that integrates the impact of the western diet and alcohol; the WASH-diet model. We show here that the WASH diet, either chronically or in small time-restricted bouts, accelerated ALD pathology with severe steatohepatitis, elevated inflammation and increased fibrosis compared to mice receiving chronic alcohol alone. We also validated our WASH-diet model as an in vivo system for testing the efficacy of experimental ALD treatments. The efficacy of the inverse-agonist SR9238, previously shown to inhibit both non-alcohol and alcohol-induced steatohepatitis progression, was conserved in our WASH-diet model. These findings suggested that the WASH-diet may be useful for in vivo pre-clinical assessment of novel therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3138559256,"Introduction Patients at intermediate-high risk of developing a pulmonary embolism (PE) are very likely to experience adverse outcomes, such as cardiovascular instability and death. The role of thrombolytic therapy in intermediate-high-risk PE remains controversial. Objectives This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of low-dose urokinase (UK) thrombolytic therapy for intermediate-high-risk PE. Patients and methods This retrospective study included 81 consecutive patients with intermediate-high-risk PE from two centers. Patients received low-dose UK or low-molecular-weight heparin (anticoagulant therapy group). The efficacy outcomes were mortality, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)-confirmed absorption, and dyspnea. Safety was assessed as the incidence of bleedings. Results The in-hospital mortality, 9-month mortality, and long-term mortality at the last follow-up were comparable for the low-dose UK group and the anticoagulant therapy group (6.45% vs. 0%, p = 0.144, 9.68% vs. 8.16%, p = 0.815, and 12.90% vs. 12.24%, p = 0.931, respectively). CTPA-confirmed absorption at one month after admission was higher in the low-dose UK group than in the anticoagulant therapy group ( p = 0.016). The incidences of short-term dyspnea at discharge and long-term dyspnea at the last follow-up were lower in the low-dose UK group than in the anticoagulant therapy group (27.59% vs. 52%, p = 0.035, 33.33% vs. 58.14%, p = 0.043, respectively). No major bleeding occurred. The incidence of minor bleeding was not significantly different between the two groups (3.23% vs. 6%, p = 0.974). Conclusion In intermediate-high-risk PE, a low-dose UK might increase CTPA-confirmed absorption and improve short-term and long-term dyspnea without affecting mortality or increasing the bleeding risk."
https://openalex.org/W3139428342,"The emergence and evolution of antibiotic resistance has been accelerated due to the widespread use of antibiotics and a lack of timely diagnostic tests that guide therapeutic treatment with adequate sensitivity, specificity, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) accuracy. Automated AST instruments are extensively used in clinical microbiology labs and provide a streamlined workflow, simplifying susceptibility testing for pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Although currently used commercial systems such as the Vitek2 and BD Phoenix can deliver results in substantially less time than conventional methods, their dependence on traditional AST inoculum concentrations and optical detection limit their speed somewhat. Herein, we describe the GeneFluidics ProMax lab automation system intended for a rapid 3.5-hour molecular AST from clinical isolates. The detection method described utilizes a higher starting inoculum concentration and automated molecular quantification of species-specific 16S rRNA through the use of an electrochemical sensor to assess microbiological responses to antibiotic exposure. A panel of clinical isolates consisting of species of gram-negative rods from the CDC AR bank and two hospitals, New York-Presbyterian Queens and Medical College of Wisconsin, were evaluated against ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and meropenem in a series of reproducibility and clinical studies. The categorical agreement and reproducibility for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 100% and 100% for ciprofloxacin, 98.7% and 100% for gentamicin and 98.5% and 98.5% for meropenem, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3136116549,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with development of generalized osteoporosis. Bone-degrading osteoclasts are derived from circulating precursor cells of monocytic lineage, and the intermediate monocyte population is important as osteoclast precursors in inflammatory conditions. T cells of various subsets are critical in the pathogenesis of both RA and associated osteoporosis, but so far, no studies have examined associations between circulating intermediate monocytes, T cell subsets and bone characteristics in patients with RA. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of intermediate monocytes in patients with untreated early rheumatoid arthritis (ueRA) compared to healthy controls (HC), and to explore the correlation between intermediate monocytes and a comprehensive panel of T helper cell subsets, bone density and bone microarchitecture in ueRA patients.78 patients with ueRA fulfilling the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria were included and compared to 29 age- and sex-matched HC. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before start of treatment and proportions of monocyte subsets and CD4+ helper and regulatory T cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. Bone densitometry was performed on 46 of the ueRA patients at inclusion using DXA and HR-pQCT.Flow cytometric analyses showed that the majority of ueRA patients had frequencies of intermediate monocytes comparable to HC. The intermediate monocyte population correlated positively with CXCR3+ Th17 cells in ueRA patients but not in HC. However, neither the proportions of intermediate monocytes nor CXCR3+ Th17 cells were associated with bone density or bone microarchitecture measurements.Our findings suggest that in early RA, the intermediate monocytes do not correlate with bone characteristics, despite positive correlation with circulating CXCR3+ Th17 cells. Future longitudinal studies in patients with longer disease duration are required to fully explore the potential of intermediate monocytes to drive bone loss in RA."

During primary comprehensive care, isolated MDRO-positive patients (n = 13) were compared with a MDRO-negative control group (n = 13) matched for functional (Spinal Cord Independence Measure-SCIM) and neurological impairment (motor scores based on the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury-ISNCSCI) at an early stage up to 40 days after SCI. SCIM scores and motor scores were obtained at 12 weeks (intermediate stage) and 24 or 48 weeks (late stage) after SCI.Isolated MDRO-positive (median duration of hospitalization: 175 days, 39% of inpatient stay under isolation measures) and non-isolated MDRO-negative (median duration of hospitalization: 161 days) patients showed functional and neurological improvements, which were not statistically different between groups at the intermediate and late stage.Prolonged isolation due to MDRO colonization for over a third of the inpatient comprehensive care period does not appear to impair neurological recovery and functional outcome within the first year after SCI."
https://openalex.org/W3139100817,"Formal and informal institutions govern fisheries around the world. Yucatan’s sea cucumber fishery is not an exemption, the sudden and fast development of the fishery in 2010 has motivated the creation of informal and illegal forms of organization. The prices, buyers’ interest and the fishing effort substantially increased, being followed by illegal fishing-fishers and traders, creating informal fishing-trade channels and severe social and biological concerns. This article aims to give account of the emergence and dynamics of the informal institutions which currently dominate this fishery. It was sought to identify the extent to which rules and regulations are not being respected and how they are affecting fish resources and coastal communities. We considered the case of the port of Sisal, Yucatan, Mexico to illustrate our argument and here we applied a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methodologies including informal and in-depth interviews applied to 17 key informants, a questionnaire applied to 47 fishers and an estimation of the degree of compliance from three of the main management measures. Socio-biological negative impacts were identified in Yucatan’s coastal communities and its fisheries. Foreign buyers and local middlemen exert high pressure on fishers to exceed the quota and catch the highest possible volumes facilitating the fisheries decline. This and the growing economic interest motivated the development of strong informal institutions supporting illegal fishing and informal trade. Social problems emerged and women were particularly affected. The economic power of the fishery is likely to overcome any type of governance structure. The enforcement of entry rules was not effective, so the governance base was around informality and illegal actions. Local and foreign buyers are exerting pressure to increase the catch volume thus it is recommended that rules and regulations be directed at buyers and exporting companies rather than at fishers."
https://openalex.org/W3136171613,"Bemisia tabaci Mediterranean (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is an economically important insect pest worldwide. Previously, we have reported that most B. tabaci Mediterranean (MED) populations occurring in greenhouse tomatoes in Korea have been displaced from well-differentiated two genetic clusters (C1 and C2) to one (C2) during one-year period. To elucidate factors responsible for this phenomenon, we compared life history parameters of these two different genetic clusters through single and cross mating experiments on two different host plants, cucumber and tobacco, at 26°C. Intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), and net reproductive rate (Ro) were significantly higher in the dominating cluster (C2) (0.247, 1.280, and 192.402, respectively on cucumber; 0.226, 1.253, and 133.792, respectively on tobacco) than in the other cluster (C1) (0.149, 1.161, and 50.539, respectively on cucumber; 0.145, 1.156, and 53.332, respectively on tobacco). Overall performances of cross mating groups, C2fC1m (C2 female × C1 male) and C1fC2m (C1 female × C2 male), were in-between those of C2 and C1, with C2fC1m performing better than C1fC2m. Thus, maternal inheritance appeared to be significantly associated with their life history parameters, with partial involvement of paternal inheritance. Our results demonstrated that the rapid displacement of genetic clusters of B. tabaci MED populations was clearly associated with differences in their life history parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3136280215,"Clinical tuberculosis research, both within research groups and across research ecosystems, is often undertaken in isolation using bespoke data collection platforms and applying differing data conventions. This failure to harmonise clinical phenotype data or apply standardised data collection and storage standards in turn limits the opportunity to undertake meta-analyses using data generated across multiple research projects for the same research domain. We have developed the Tuberculosis DataBase Template (TBDBT), a template for the well-supported, free and commonly deployed clinical databasing platform, REDCap. This template can be used to set up a new tuberculosis research database with a built-in set of standardised data conventions, to ensure standardised data capture across research projects and programs. A modular design enables researchers to implement only the modules of the database template that are appropriate for their particular study. The template includes core modules for informed consent data, participant demographics, clinical symptoms and presentation, diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests. Optional modules have been designed for visit scheduling and calendar functionality, clinical trial randomisation, study logistics and operations, and pharmacokinetic data. Additional fields can be added as needed. This REDCap template can facilitate collection of high-quality data for tuberculosis research, providing a tool to ensure better data harmonisation, analysis and meta-analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3137353635,"During tooth development, dental papilla cells differentiate into odontoblasts with polarized morphology and cell function. Our previous study indicated that the C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway regulates human dental papilla cell adhesion, migration, and formation of focal adhesion complexes. The aim of this study was to further examine the role of the JNK pathway in dental papilla cell polarity formation. Histological staining, qPCR, and Western Blot suggested the activation of JNK signaling in polarized mouse dental papilla tissue. After performing an in vitro tooth germ organ culture and cell culture, we found that JNK inhibitor SP600125 postponed tooth germ development and reduced the polarization, migration and differentiation of mouse dental papilla cells (mDPCs). Next, we screened up-regulated polarity-related genes during dental papilla development and mDPCs or A11 differentiation. We found that Prickle3, Golga2, Golga5, and RhoA were all up-regulated, which is consistent with JNK signaling activation. Further, constitutively active RhoA mutant (RhoA Q63L) partly rescued the inhibition of SP600125 on cell differentiation and polarity formation of mDPCs. To sum up, this study suggests that JNK signaling has a positive role in the formation of dental papilla cell polarization."
https://openalex.org/W3137365187,"To retrospectively assess the repeatability of physiological F-18 labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the skin on positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) and explore its regional distribution and relationship with sex and age.Out of 562 examinations with normal FDG distribution on whole-body PET/MRI, 74 repeated examinations were evaluated to assess the repeatability and regional distribution of physiological skin uptake. Furthermore, 224 examinations were evaluated to compare differences in the uptake due to sex and age. Skin segmentation on PET was performed as body-surface contouring on an MR-based attenuation correction map using an off-line reconstruction software. Bland-Altman plots were created for the repeatability assessment. Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to compare the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) with regional distribution, age, and sex.The limits of agreement for the difference in SUVmean and SUVmax of the skin were less than 30%. The highest SUVmax was observed in the face (3.09±1.04), followed by the scalp (2.07±0.53). The SUVmax in the face of boys aged 0-9 years and 10-20 years (1.33±0.64 and 2.05±1.00, respectively) and girls aged 0-9 years (0.98±0.38) was significantly lower than that of men aged ≥20 years and girls aged ≥10 years (p<0.001). In women, the SUVmax of the face (2.31±0.71) of ≥70-year-olds was significantly lower than that of 30-39-year-olds (3.83±0.82) (p<0.05).PET/MRI enabled the quantitative analysis of skin FDG uptake with repeatability. The degree of physiological FDG uptake in the skin was the highest in the face and varied between sexes. Although attention to differences in body habitus between age groups is needed, skin FDG uptake also depended on age."
https://openalex.org/W3138235113,"Children's movies often provide messages about morally appropriate and inappropriate conduct. In two studies, we draw on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to derive predictions about actual depictions of morality, and people's preferences for different moral depictions, within children's movies. According to MFT, people's moral concerns include individualizing foundations of care and fairness and binding foundations of loyalty, authority, and sanctity. Prior work reveals that although there are political differences in the endorsement of these two broad categories-whereby stronger political conservatism predicts stronger binding concerns and weaker individualizing concerns-there nonetheless is broad agreement across political identity in the importance of individualizing concerns. We therefore predicted that heroes would value individualizing foundations more than villains, and that despite political differences in preferences for moral messages, there would be more agreement in the importance of messages promoting individualizing concerns. In Study 1, we coded heroes and villains from popular children's movies for their valuation of moral foundations. Heroes valued individualizing concerns more, and binding concerns less, than villains did. Participants in Study 2 considered moral dilemmas faced by children's movie characters, and rated their preferences for resolutions that promoted either individualizing or binding foundations. Although liberals preferred individualizing-promoting resolutions and conservatives preferred binding-promoting resolutions, there was stronger agreement across political identity in the importance of individualizing concerns. Despite political differences in moral preferences, popular depictions of children's movie characters and people's self-reported moral endorsement suggest a shared belief in the importance of the individualizing moral virtues of care and fairness. Movies are often infused with moral messages. From their exploration of overarching themes, their ascription of particular traits to heroic and villainous characters, and their resolution of pivotal moral dilemmas, movies provide viewers with depictions of morally virtuous (and morally suspect) behavior. Moral messaging in children's movies is of particular importance, since it is targeted at an audience for which morality is actively developing. What moral messages do filmmakers (and consumers, including parents) want children's movies to depict? Are these preferences related to people's political identity? And what are the actual moral depictions presented in movies? In the present two studies, we draw on an influential theory of moral judgment-Moral Foundations Theory-to develop and test predictions about the depiction of morality in children's movies."
https://openalex.org/W3137296416,"This paper studies whether demographic similarities between middle and top managers with different tasks (strategy formation and strategy implementation) impacts organizational performance. By drawing on relational demography theory, we investigate the effect of similarity in gender, organizational tenure, and in both these demographics on the overall costs of Dutch municipalities. The main findings of this paper show that the similarity effects are interrelated: when middle and top managers diverge on only one demographic, performance is increased. Also, when leaders are similar on both demographics, performance is impaired. We conclude by discussing the implications for the literature on middle management, relational demography, and strategy formation and implementation."
