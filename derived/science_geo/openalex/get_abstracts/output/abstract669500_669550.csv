https://openalex.org/W3133794453,"SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), a novel lineage of coronavirus causing COVID-19, contains substitutions in two immunodominant domains of the spike protein. Here, we show that pseudovirus expressing 501Y.V2 spike protein completely escapes three classes of therapeutically relevant antibodies. This pseudovirus also exhibits substantial to complete escape from neutralization, but not binding, by convalescent plasma. These data highlight the prospect of reinfection with antigenically distinct variants and foreshadows reduced efficacy of spike-based vaccines. Substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein present in the B.1.351 variant first detected in South Africa, when expressed in pseudoviruses, mediate escape from neutralization by monoclonal antibodies under clinical development and by plasma from individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, but do not prevent binding of convalescent plasma to recombinant spike protein containing B.1.351 lineage substitutions."
https://openalex.org/W3135690257,"Aim In spring 2020, the first Covid-19-related lockdown included the closing of kindergartens and schools. Home schooling, the lack of social contacts with peers and the care of the children at home posed an enormous challenge for many families. Methods The present study investigated the leisure behavior of 285 one- to 10-year-old German children at two time points (t1 and t2) during the Covid-19-related lockdown in spring 2020. In the subsample of primary school children (n = 102), we also explored children’s attitudes towards schoolwork at home. Analyses focused on the change of behavior from t1 to t2, on differences in these changes depending on socio-economic status (SES), and on associations of behavior with SES, the number of children at home, and the frequency of receiving learning materials from school. Results While the frequency of playing outside increased significantly from t1 to t2, the frequency of handicrafts, playing board games, indoor sports, and motivation to do schoolwork decreased. The observed changes between t1 and t2 did not differ depending on SES. However, a lower SES was associated with higher media use, less outdoor activity, and (though only marginally significant) a reduced time doing schoolwork and a reduced ability to concentrate on schoolwork at t1. In households with more children, children played outside more often, but were read to less frequently and (though only marginally significant) watched movies and series less frequently. Children receiving learning materials from school on a regular basis spent significantly more time doing schoolwork at home than children receiving materials only irregularly. Conclusions A continuing loss of childcare in day-care facilities and schools entails the danger of declining education in the form of (inter)active indoor activities and schoolwork."
https://openalex.org/W3133659278,"Mammalian cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels play an essential role in the signal transduction of the visual and olfactory sensory systems. Here we reveal the structural mechanism of ligand gating in human rod CNGA1 channel by determining its cryo-EM structures in both the apo closed and cGMP-bound open states. Distinct from most other members of voltage-gated tetrameric cation channels, CNGA1 forms a central channel gate in the middle of the membrane, occluding the central cavity. Structural analyses of ion binding profiles in the selectivity filters of the wild-type channel and the E365Q filter mutant allow us to unambiguously define the two Ca2+ binding sites inside the selectivity filter, providing structural insights into Ca2+ blockage and permeation in CNG channels. The structure of the E365Q mutant also reveals two alternative side-chain conformations at Q365, providing a plausible explanation for the voltage-dependent gating of CNG channel acquired upon E365 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W3129375331,"Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARG) is one of the three members of the PPAR family of transcription factors. Besides its roles in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, we recently demonstrated an association between PPARG and metastasis in prostate cancer. In this study a functional effect of PPARG on AKT serine/threonine kinase 3 (AKT3), which ultimately results in a more aggressive disease phenotype was identified. AKT3 has previously been shown to regulate PPARG co-activator 1 alpha (PGC1α) localisation and function through its action on chromosome maintenance region 1 (CRM1). AKT3 promotes PGC1α localisation to the nucleus through its inhibitory effects on CRM1, a known nuclear export protein. Collectively our results demonstrate how PPARG over-expression drives an increase in AKT3 levels, which in turn has the downstream effect of increasing PGC1α localisation within the nucleus, driving mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, this increase in mitochondrial mass provides higher energetic output in the form of elevated ATP levels which may fuel the progression of the tumour cell through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and ultimately metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3135883937,"We discuss the impact of a Covid-19--like shock on a simple model economy, described by the previously developed Mark-0 Agent-Based Model. We consider a mixed supply and demand shock, and show that depending on the shock parameters (amplitude and duration), our model economy can display V-shaped, U-shaped or W-shaped recoveries, and even an L-shaped output curve with permanent output loss. This is due to the economy getting trapped in a self-sustained ""bad"" state. We then discuss two policies that attempt to moderate the impact of the shock: giving easy credit to firms, and the so-called helicopter money, i.e. injecting new money into the households savings. We find that both policies are effective if strong enough. We highlight the potential danger of terminating these policies too early, although inflation is substantially increased by lax access to credit. Finally, we consider the impact of a second lockdown. While we only discuss a limited number of scenarios, our model is flexible and versatile enough to accommodate a wide variety of situations, thus serving as a useful exploratory tool for a qualitative, scenario-based understanding of post-Covid recovery. The corresponding code is available on-line."
https://openalex.org/W3133675871,"Background The primary objective of National NCD monitoring survey (NNMS) was to generate national-level estimates of key NCD indicators identified in the national NCD monitoring framework. This paper describes survey study protocol and prevalence of risk factors among adults (18–69 years). Materials and methods NNMS was a national level cross-sectional survey conducted during 2017–18. The estimated sample size was 12,000 households from 600 primary sampling units. One adult (18–69 years) per household was selected using the World Health Organization-KISH grid. The study tools were adapted from WHO-STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance, IDSP-NCD risk factor survey and WHO-Global adult tobacco survey. Total of 8/10 indicators of adult NCD risk factors according to national NCD disease monitoring framework was studied. This survey for the first time estimated dietary intake of salt intake of population at a national level from spot urine samples. Results Total of 11139 households and 10659 adults completed the survey. Prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use was 32.8% (95% CI: 30.8–35.0) and 15.9% (95% CI: 14.2–17.7) respectively. More than one-third adults were physically inactive [41.3% (95% CI: 39.4–43.3)], majority [98.4% (95% CI: 97.8–98.8)] consumed less than 5 servings of fruits and / or vegetables per day and mean salt intake was 8 g/day (95% CI: 7.8–8.2). Proportion with raised blood pressure and raised blood glucose were 28.5% (95% CI: 27.0–30.1) and 9.3% (95% CI: 8.3–10.5) respectively. 12.8% (95% CI: 11.2–14.5) of adults (40–69 years) had ten-year CVD risk of ≥30% or with existing CVD. Conclusion NNMS was the first comprehensive national survey providing relevant data to assess India’s progress towards targets in National NCD monitoring framework and NCD Action Plan. Established methodology and findings from survey would contribute to plan future state-based surveys and also frame policies for prevention and control of NCDs."
https://openalex.org/W3135391179,"Lymph node metastasis (LNM), a common metastatic gastric-cancer (GC) route, is closely related to poor prognosis in GC patients. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) preferentially engraft at metastatic lesions. Whether BM-MSCs are specifically reprogrammed by LNM-derived GC cells (LNM-GCs) and incorporated into metastatic LN microenvironment to prompt GC malignant progression remains unknown. Herein, we found that LNM-GCs specifically educated BM-MSCs via secretory exosomes. Exosomal Wnt5a was identified as key protein mediating LNM-GCs education of BM-MSCs, which was verified by analysis of serum exosomes collected from GC patients with LNM. Wnt5a-enriched exosomes induced YAP dephosphorylation in BM-MSCs, whereas Wnt5a-deficient exosomes exerted the opposite effect. Inhibition of YAP signaling by verteporfin blocked LNM-GC exosome- and serum exosome-mediated reprogramming in BM-MSCs. Analysis of MSC-like cells obtained from metastatic LN tissues of GC patients (GLN-MSCs) confirmed that BM-MSCs incorporated into metastatic LN microenvironment, and that YAP activation participated in maintaining their tumor-promoting phenotype and function. Collectively, our results show that LNM-GCs specifically educated BM-MSCs via exosomal Wnt5a-elicited activation of YAP signaling. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of LNM in GC and BM-MSC reprogramming, and will provide potential therapeutic targets and detection indicators for GC patients with LNM."

https://openalex.org/W3130941659,"While effective preventive measures against COVID-19 are now widely known, many individuals fail to adopt them. This article provides experimental evidence about one potentially important driver of compliance with social distancing: social norms. We asked each of 23,000 survey respondents in Mexico to predict how a fictional person would behave when faced with the choice about whether or not to attend a friend’s birthday gathering. Every respondent was randomly assigned to one of four social norms conditions. Expecting that other people would attend the gathering and/or believing that other people approved of attending the gathering both increased the predicted probability that the fictional character would attend the gathering by 25%, in comparison with a scenario where other people were not expected to attend nor to approve of attending. Our results speak to the potential effects of communication campaigns and media coverage of compliance with, and normative views about, COVID-19 preventive measures. They also suggest that policies aimed at modifying social norms or making existing ones salient could impact compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3135058214,"Farmers’ perception on soil erosion has not adequately reported in the conditions of Ghana though its causes and effects are time and site-specific. The objective of this study was to assess farmers’ perception on soil erosion and implication for developing soil management strategy in the Eastern and Northern Regions of Ghana. A total of 130 household head farmers were interviewed and complemented with field observation and group. Data was analyzed using descriptive, chi-square test, T-test and binary logistic regression. The results show that there was significant variation in socioeconomic, farm and institutional attributes among the farmers`in the study regions. In the Eastern and Northern Regions, significantly higher proportions of the farmers (95.7% and 86.7%, respectively) perceived soil erosion as serious problem. Significantly higher proportions of the respondents (80%) perceived severe erosion problem at homestead land in the Eastern Region whereas severe erosion in the Northern Region was more noticed at distance farmlands (85.0%). In the two regions, the major causes of severe erosion as perceived by most farmers were over-cultivation, deforestation and heavy rainfall events. In the Eastern and Northern Regions, 58.6% and 75.0% of the farmers perceived, respectively, that soil erosion severity has been increased since the past 10-years. Perceptions of most frequently noted indicators of soil erosion were declined productivity, shallow soil depth, presence of rills, sheet erosion, soil loss from farmland, and change in soil color. Results of the binary logistic regression indicate that there is heterogeneity in the factors accounting for the perception of soil fertility. In developing promising soil management strategy in the study area, attention must be given to key socioeconomic, biophysical, farm and institutional factors."
https://openalex.org/W3134970459,"The hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) family consists of octaheme proteins that harbor seven bis-His ligated electron-transferring hemes and one 5-coordinate catalytic heme with His axial ligation. Oxidative HAOs have a homotrimeric configuration with the monomers covalently attached to each other via a unique double cross-link between a Tyr residue and the catalytic heme moiety of an adjacent subunit. This cross-linked active site heme, termed the P460 cofactor, has been hypothesized to modulate enzyme reactivity toward oxidative catalysis. Conversely, the absence of this cross-link is predicted to favor reductive catalysis. However, this prediction has not been directly tested. In this study, an HAO homolog that lacks the heme-Tyr cross-link (HAOr) was purified to homogeneity from the nitrite-dependent anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacterium Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, and its catalytic and spectroscopic properties were assessed. We show that HAOr reduced nitrite to nitric oxide and also reduced nitric oxide and hydroxylamine as nonphysiological substrates. In contrast, HAOr was not able to oxidize hydroxylamine or hydrazine supporting the notion that cross-link-deficient HAO enzymes are reductases. Compared with oxidative HAOs, we found that HAOr harbors an active site heme with a higher (at least 80 mV) midpoint potential and a much lower degree of porphyrin ruffling. Based on the physiology of anammox bacteria and our results, we propose that HAOr reduces nitrite to nitric oxide in vivo, providing anammox bacteria with NO, which they use to activate ammonium in the absence of oxygen.

Cytochrome c proteins are among the most common redox tools in nature and are ubiquitous in all domains of life (1Richardson D.J. Bacterial respiration: A flexible process for a changing environment.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The electron configuration of elemental iron in combination with both the electrochemical properties of the heme porphyrin and the structural and functional contributions from the protein backbone renders heme c cofactors suitable for catalysis and electron transfer. This versatility is further enhanced by the arrangement of two or more heme cofactors within a protein as seen in the multiheme cytochromes c (MCCs). This class of proteins is involved in prokaryotic energy metabolism ranging from intra- or extracellular electron transfer to substrate conversion (2Simon J. Kern M. Hermann B. Einsle O. Butt J.N.

The structure of Kustc0458 revealed the absence of the heme-Tyr cross-link but otherwise highlighted the high structural conservation within the HAO family. Kustc0458 crystallized as a heterododecamer (α6β6) with a diheme cytochrome c (Kustc0457; DH), resulting in a total of 60 hemes for the Kustc0458/7 protein complex (26Dietl A. Maalcke W.J. Ferousi C.

Biol. 2019; 75: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Based on the structure, the heterohexamer (α3β3) presents the largest possible heme circuit within the complex and complies with the heme ring arrangement that is seen in all oxidative HAOs. In this case, the heme ring is modified by the addition of two 6-coordinate hemes, contributed by the DH subunits, at each HAO surface heme (heme 1). In analogy with the oxidative HAOs, the Kustc0458/7 catalytic protomer (αβ) comprises nine hemes with saturated coordination—seven HAO bis-His and two DH His/Met ligated hemes—and one 5-coordinate HAO His-ligated heme (heme 4). Kustc0458 is highly transcribed and expressed in K. stuttgartiensis cells under standard laboratory growth conditions (27Kartal B. Maalcke W.J. de Almeida N.M. Cirpus I. Gloerich J. Geerts W.

Wessels H. van Alen T. Jetten M.S.M. Kartal B. Nitric oxide-dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). During this NO-dependent anaerobic NH4+ oxidation, transcription of both Kustc0458 and Kustc0457 was strongly downregulated (28- and 39-fold, respectively). Additionally, the only NO-forming nitrite reductase identified in the K. stuttgartiensis genome (cd1NiR homolog) had low abundance in both transcriptomes and proteomes obtained under standard and NO-dependent growth conditions (25Hu Z.

Furthermore, neither cd1 cytochrome (cd1NiR) nor copper-containing (CuNiR) nitrite reductase homologs are conserved among anammox genomes, while the orthologs of Kustc0458 are present in all known anammox genera (26Dietl A. Maalcke W.J. Ferousi C. Jetten M.S.M. Kartal B. Barends T.R.M. A 60-heme reductase complex from an anammox bacterium shows an extended electron transfer pathway.Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Based on in vivo observations from K. stuttgartiensis, Kustc0458 was implicated in the reduction of nitrite to NO, the first step of the anammox pathway (23Kartal B. de Almeida N.M. Maalcke W.J.

In this study, we purified the native Kustc0458/7 complex from K. stuttgartiensis biomass, assessed its catalytic potential involving physiologically relevant nitrogen species and showed that this protein reduces nitrite to NO. Our findings are examined in the context of the HAO protein family, and the physiological relevance of Kustc0458/7 is discussed. Kustc0458 was consistently purified from K. stuttgartiensis single-cell enrichment cultures in an equimolar complex with Kustc0457. Native and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) migration profiles indicated a stable, noncovalent dodecameric composition for the complex in solution that is in agreement with the crystallographically resolved structure (26Dietl A. Maalcke W.J. Ferousi C. Jetten M.S.M. Kartal B. Barends T.R.M. A 60-heme reductase complex from an anammox bacterium shows an extended electron transfer pathway.Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The electronic absorption spectra of the fully reduced protein revealed the absence of the characteristic P460 absorption feature (Fig. 1), in line with the absence of the Tyr cross-link. Fully oxidized (as isolated) Kustc0458/7 displayed a Soret maximum at 409 nm, which broadened and shifted to 415 nm upon partial reduction by ascorbate. Full reduction by dithionite resulted in a sharp Soret at 419.5 nm, a subtle shoulder at 425 nm, and Q band maxima at 524 and 553 nm. Notably, despite the Met axial ligation of both DH heme iron centers (26Dietl A. Maalcke W.J. Ferousi C. Jetten M.S.M. Kartal B. Barends T.R.M. A 60-heme reductase complex from an anammox bacterium shows an extended electron transfer pathway.Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), no charge transfer band at 695 nm was observed. To test whether the Tyr cross-link is necessary for oxidative catalysis, we probed the capacity of Kustc0458/7 to oxidize NH2OH and N2H4 spectroscopically. Depending on the sample preparation, the measured rates were ranging from zero to about 0.020 U mg−1 for both substrates, which is 100- to 1000-fold slower compared with the anammox oxidative HAOs and NeHAO, respectively. Notably, both anammox oxidative HAOs are among the most abundant proteins in K. stuttgartiensis cells (27Kartal B. Maalcke W.J. de Almeida N.M. Cirpus I. Gloerich J. Geerts W. Op den Camp H.J. Harhangi H.R. Janssen-Megens E.M. Francoijs K.J. Stunnenberg H.G. Keltjens J.T. Jetten M.S. Strous M. Molecular mechanism of anaerobic ammonium oxidation.Nature. 2011; 479: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and hence, even a minute (i.e., ∼0.5%) contamination of the Kustc0458/7 sample with either KsHAO or KsHDH (for NH2OH or N2H4 oxidation, respectively) could explain the measured rates, strongly suggesting that Kustc0458/7 is not an oxidative catalyst. Reductive reactivity of Kustc0458/7 toward NO2−, NO, and NH2OH was investigated by monitoring the oxidation of the methyl viologen monocation radical (MVred) (32Lawton T.J. Bowen K.E. Sayavedra-Soto L.A. Arp D.J. Rosenzweig A.C. Characterization of a nitrite reductase involved in nitrifier denitrification.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 25575-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At 50 μM substrate concentration, NO2− reduction proceeded at 0.1 U mg−1 while NO and NH2OH were consistently faster (2.8 and 4.6 U mg−1, respectively). Similar kinetic trends have been observed for the ammonia-producing respiratory cytochrome c nitrite reductase (ccNiR) and were explained by the presumed higher activation entropy for hydroxylamine reduction (33van Wonderen J.H. Burlat B. Richardson D.J. Cheesman M.R. Butt J.N. The nitric oxide reductase activity of cytochrome c nitrite reductase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9587-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Colorimetric determination of ammonia after completion of each reductive assay routinely returned the same substrate-to-product ratios: 1:0.6, 1:1, and 1:1 for NO2−, NO, and NH2OH, respectively. The stoichiometric nitrogen imbalance observed for nitrite conversion is presumably due to the release of at least one catalytic intermediate from the Kustc0458/7 active site during catalysis in vitro. Given the reducing environment in the assay achieved by excess MVred and the higher catalytic rates of Kustc0458/7 for the downstream reactions at relevant concentrations, i.e., NO and NH2OH reduction, this observation could only be attributed to finely tuned binding equilibria that could possibly be affected by redox modulations of the extended 9-heme network per active site. In order to determine whether Kustc0458/7 performed its predicted physiological function of nitrite reduction to NO, different artificial electron carriers were used with nitrite as the substrate. The reducing environment created by excess MVred and the reactivity of NO prevented the direct measurement of NO when MVred was used as the electron carrier. To circumvent this problem, phenazine ethosulfate, which has a much higher midpoint potential (E′0 = +55 mV) compared with MV (E′0 = −440 mV), was used as an electron carrier to directly measure NO production in membrane-inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) experiments. Here, when the reaction was initiated with the addition of nitrite, stable and reproducible NO production was detected at a rate of 0.52 mU mg−1 (Fig. 2). Colorimetric nitrite measurements at the end of these experiments showed that all nitrite reduction could be accounted for by the produced NO and no other nitrogenous species such as hydroxylamine or ammonium were produced. Based on these results, we conclude that the Kustc0458/7 protein complex is a NO-producing reductive HAO that is incompetent for oxidative catalysis. Whereas HAOr from K. stuttgartiensis and HAOs from Epsilonproteobacteria all lack appreciable in vitro oxidative activity (24Haase D. Hermann B. Einsle O. Simon J. Epsilonproteobacterial hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (εHao): Characterization of a 'missing link' in the multihaem cytochrome c family.Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 105: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), oxidative HAO complexes, conversely, have been shown to act as reductases in vitro, albeit with diverse rates. Both NeHAO and KsHAO can reduce NO2−, and NeHAO can also reduce NO and NH2OH, demonstrating that the HAO active site architecture is inherently competent for substrate reduction (14Maalcke W.J.

However, whether socioeconomic inequality is associated with the prevalence and diagnosis experience of osteoporosis remains largely unexplored. This study aims to investigate whether socioeconomic inequality can be a risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Cross-sectional data of 1,477 postmenopausal women aged over 50 obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey V-2 were analyzed. Univariate analyses were performed to calculate the prevalence of osteoporosis and the rate of osteoporosis diagnosis experience according to the risk factor categories. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent variables' associations with osteoporosis prevalence and diagnosis experience. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 34.8%, while the diagnosis experience rate was 22.1%. The higher the age, the higher the probability of osteoporosis presence and diagnosis experience. The lowest household income level was associated with a 1.63 times higher risk of osteoporosis. On the contrary, this factor was not significant for diagnosis experience. These results were similar for the 50-59 and 60-69 age groups. Among postmenopausal women, those who are older and have low socioeconomic levels are at a high risk of developing osteoporosis. Moreover, the lower the socioeconomic level, the lower the awareness of osteoporosis. Therefore, there is a need to develop more proactive preventive measures in postmenopausal women with low socioeconomic levels."

However, investigations are generally focused on the analysis of their downstream targets and biological functions in overexpression and knockdown approaches, while miRNAs endogenous levels and activity remain poorly understood. Here, we used the cellular plasticity-regulating process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as a model to show the efficacy of a fluorescent sensor to separate cells with distinct EMT signatures, based on miR-200b/c activity. The system was further combined with a CRISPR-Cas9 screening platform to unbiasedly identify miR-200b/c upstream regulating genes. The sensor allows to infer miRNAs fundamental biological properties, as profiling of sorted cells indicated miR-200b/c as a molecular switch between EMT differentiation and proliferation, and suggested a role for metabolic enzymes in miR-200/EMT regulation. Analysis of miRNAs endogenous levels and activity for in vitro and in vivo applications could lead to a better understanding of their biological role in physiology and disease."

This study investigates whether this form of gender discrimination is associated with worse mental health outcomes for women. Our primary data source is a new, state-representative mobile phone survey of women ages 18–65 in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Maharashtra in 2018. We measure mental health using questions from the World Health Organization’s Self-Reporting Questionnaire. We find that, for women in these states, eating last is correlated with worse mental health, even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. We discuss two possible mechanisms for this relationship: eating last may be associated with worse mental health because it is associated with worse physical health, or eating last may be associated with poor mental health because it is associated with less autonomy, or both."
https://openalex.org/W3134956527,"Recent research has demonstrated that pupillometry is a robust measure for quantifying listening effort. However, pupillary responses in listening situations where multiple cognitive functions are engaged and sustained over a period of time remain hard to interpret. This limits our conceptualisation and understanding of listening effort in realistic situations, because rarely in everyday life are people challenged by one task at a time. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to reveal the dynamics of listening effort in a sustained listening condition using a word repeat and recall task. Words were presented in quiet and speech-shaped noise at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR): 0dB, 7dB, 14dB and quiet. Participants were presented with lists of 10 words, and required to repeat each word after its presentation. At the end of the list, participants either recalled as many words as possible or moved on to the next list. Simultaneously, their pupil dilation was recorded throughout the whole experiment. When only word repeating was required, peak pupil dilation (PPD) was bigger in 0dB versus other conditions; whereas when recall was required, PPD showed no difference among SNR levels and PPD in 0dB was smaller than repeat-only condition. Baseline pupil diameter and PPD followed different variation patterns across the 10 serial positions within a block for conditions requiring recall: baseline pupil diameter built up progressively and plateaued in the later positions (but shot up when listeners were recalling the previously heard words from memory); PPD decreased at a pace quicker than in repeat-only condition. The current findings demonstrate that additional cognitive load during a speech intelligibility task could disturb the well-established relation between pupillary response and listening effort. Both the magnitude and temporal pattern of task-evoked pupillary response differ greatly in complex listening conditions, urging for more listening effort studies in complex and realistic listening situations."

Wild fishing cats ( Prionailurus viverrinus ), a globally vulnerable species, have been found dead. Postmortem examination of the carcasses revealed lesions in intestine, spleen and kidney. CPPV-1 antigen identification in these tissues, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), supported the infection by the virus. PCR- and IHC-positivity in kidney tissues revealed atypical localization of the virus while in situ hybridization (ISH) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with the pop-off technique confirmed the first description of viral localization in kidneys. Complete genome characterization and deduced amino acid analysis of the obtained CPPV-1 from the fishing cats revealed FPV as a causative agent. The detected FPV sequences showed amino acid mutations at I566M and M569R in the capsid protein. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of complete coding genome sequences revealed that the fishing cat CPPV-1 genomes are genetically clustered to the FPV genomes isolated from domestic cats in Thailand. Since the 1970s, these genomes have also been shown to share a genetic evolution with Chinese FPV strains. This study is the first evidence of CPPV-1 infection in fishing cats and it is the first to show its localization in the kidneys. These findings support the multi-host range of this parvovirus and suggest fatal CPPV-1 infections may result in other vulnerable wild carnivores."

Previous studies conducted in Ethiopia found that bodyweight not adjusted for height at the start of treatment is associated with poor treatment outcomes. However, the association of body mass index (BMI) and weight change during treatment with treatment outcomes has not been studied. We aimed to investigate the association of BMI at the time of diagnosis and after two months of treatment and TB treatment outcomes.Using an ambi-directional cohort study design (retrospective and prospective), a total of 456 participants were enrolled among 30 randomly selected public health centers residing within six sub-cities of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data were collected using medical chart abstraction and face to face interviews. We compared TB treatment outcomes in persons with a body mass index (BMI) <18.5kg/m2 (underweight) versus persons with BMI ≥18.5kg/m2 (normal or overweight) at treatment initiation and after two months of treatment. Treatment was classified as successful in persons who were free of symptoms and had a negative sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli at the end of the 6-month treatment course. We analysed outcomes using univariable and multivariable logistic regression with 95% CI and p value< 0.05.Of enrolled study participants, 184 (40.4%) were underweight and 272 (59.6%) were normal or overweight. Body mass index (BMI ≥18.5kg/m2) at the start and second month of treatment were independent predictors for successful treatment outcome (AOR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.39) and (AOR = 3.55; 95% CI: 1.29, 9.73), respectively. The probability of treatment success among patients with BMI≥18.5kg/m2 at the start and second month of treatment was 92.9% and 97.1%, respectively versus 86.5% and 91.7% in patients with BMI<18.5kg/m2. Bodyweight not adjusted for height and change in the bodyweight after the second and sixth months of treatment were not significantly associated with treatment success.In persons treated for TB disease, being underweight at baseline and after two months of treatment was a predictor for unsuccessful treatment outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W3134690129,"Progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes a major unresolved clinical challenge, and effective targeted therapies are lacking. Because microtubule dynamics play pivotal roles in breast cancer metastasis, we performed RNA sequencing on 245 samples from TNBC patients to characterize the landscape of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Here, our transcriptome analyses revealed that low expression of one MAP, tektin4, indicated poor patient outcomes. Tektin4 loss led to a marked increase in TNBC migration, invasion, and metastasis and a decrease in microtubule stability. Mechanistically, we identified a novel microtubule-associated complex containing tektin4 and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Tektin4 loss increased the interaction between HDAC6 and α-tubulin, thus decreasing microtubule stability through HDAC6-mediated tubulin deacetylation. Significantly, we found that tektin4 loss sensitized TNBC cells, xenograft models, and patient-derived organoid models to the HDAC6-selective inhibitor ACY1215. Furthermore, tektin4 expression levels were positively correlated with microtubule stability levels in clinical samples. Together, our findings uncover a metastasis suppressor function of tektin4 and support clinical development of HDAC6 inhibition as a new therapeutic strategy for tektin4-deficient TNBC patients."

Here IC50s and ring-stage assays (RSAs) were used to compare extracts of A . annua (DLAe) to artemisinin (ART) and its derivatives in their ability to inhibit and kill Plasmodium falciparum strains 3D7, MRA1252, MRA1240, Cam3.11 and Cam3.11rev in vitro . Strains were sorbitol and Percoll synchronized to enrich for ring-stage parasites that were treated with hot water, methanol and dichloromethane extracts of DLA, artemisinin, CoArtem™, and dihydroartemisinin. Extracts of A . afra SEN were also tested. There was a correlation between ART concentration and inhibition of parasite growth. Although at 6 hr drug incubation, the RSAs for Cam3.11rev showed DLA and ART were less effective than high dose CoArtem™, 8 and 24 hr incubations yielded equivalent antiparasitic results. For Cam3.11, drug incubation time had no effect. DLAe was more effective on resistant MRA-1240 than on the sensitive MRA-1252 strain. Because results were not as robust as observed in animal and human studies, a host interaction was suspected, so sera collected from adult and pediatric Kenyan malaria patients was used in RSA inhibition experiments and compared to sera from adults naïve to the disease. The sera from both age groups of malaria patients inhibited parasite growth ≥ 70% after treatment with DLAe and compared to malaria naïve subjects suggesting some host interaction with DLA. The discrepancy between these data and in-vivo reports suggested that DLA’s effects require an interaction with the host to unlock their potential as an antimalarial therapy. Although we showed there are serum-based host effects that can kill up to 95% of parasites in vitro , it remains unclear how or if they play a role in vivo . These results further our understanding of how DLAe works against the malaria parasite in vitro ."
https://openalex.org/W3134049337,"Background Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) has been hypothesized to affect COVID-19 risk. Objective To examine the association between use of ACEI/ARB and household transmission of COVID-19. Methods We conducted a modified cohort study of household contacts of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 4 and May 17, 2020 in a large Northeast US health system. Household members were identified by geocoding and full address matching with exclusion of addresses with &gt;10 matched residents or known congregate living functions. Medication use, clinical conditions and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained from electronic medical record (EMR) data on cohort entry. Cohort members were followed for at least one month after exposure to determine who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Mixed effects logistic regression and propensity score analyses were used to assess adjusted associations between medication use and testing positive. Results 1,499 of the 9,101 household contacts were taking an ACEI or an ARB. Probability of COVID-19 diagnosis during the study period was slightly higher among ACEI/ARB users in unadjusted analyses. However, ACEI/ARB users were older and more likely to have clinical comorbidities so that use of ACEI/ARB was associated with a decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 in mixed effect models (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44–0.81) or propensity score analyses (predicted probability 18.6% in ACEI/ARB users vs. 24.5% in non-users, p = 0.03). These associations were similar within age and comorbidity subgroups, including patients with documented hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, as well as when including other medications in the models. Conclusions In this observational study of household transmission, use of ACEIs or ARBs was associated with a decreased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. While causality cannot be inferred from these observational data, our results support current recommendations to continue ACEI/ARB in individuals at risk of COVID-19 exposure."

DPES scales showed high reliability. Exploratory Factor Analysis showed that a 6-factor model fits the Italian sample better. Joy and Contentment loaded on the same factor. Items assessing the other five emotions loaded on separate factors. The patterns of relationships between positive emotion dispositions, positive and negative affects traits (PANAS), and personality traits (BFI) indicated concurrent validity of the DPES. Twelve separated multiple regression models with BFI and ERQ factors as predictors and DPES factors as response variables showed that Extraversion significantly positively predicted of all DPES emotions. Agreeableness predicted Happiness, Love, Compassion, and Awe positively. Conscientiousness predicted Amusement and Love negatively and Compassion, Pride, and Happiness positively. Neuroticism predicted all emotions negatively except for Compassion. Positive emotions were significantly and positively predicted by reappraisal, and negatively predicted by suppression."
https://openalex.org/W3135726044,"The treatability of seven wastewater samples generated by a textile digital printing industry was evaluated by employing 1) anammox-based processes for nitrogen removal 2) microalgae ( Chlorella vulgaris) for nutrient uptake and biomass production 3) white-rot fungi ( Pleurotus ostreatus and Phanerochaete chrysosporium) for decolorization and laccase activity. The biodegradative potential of each type of organism was determined in batch tests and correlated with the main characteristics of the textile wastewaters through statistical analyses. The maximum specific anammox activity ranged between 0.1 and 0.2 g N g VSS -1 d -1 depending on the sample of wastewater; the photosynthetic efficiency of the microalgae decreased up to 50% during the first 24 hours of contact with the textile wastewaters, but it improved from then on; Pleurotus ostreatus synthetized laccases and removed between 20–62% of the colour after 14 days, while the enzymatic activity of Phanerochaete chrysosporium was inhibited. Overall, the findings suggest that all microbes have great potential for the treatment and valorisation of textile wastewater after tailored adaptation phases. Yet, the depurative efficiency can be probably enhanced by combining the different processes in sequence."

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the new PH-LHD criteria, recommended by the 6th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension and to determine the prognostic value of Cpc-PH.A total of 701 patients with symptomatic heart failure who had undergone right-heart catheterization were divided into the following four groups: (i) Isolated post-capillary PH (Ipc-PH) group; mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) >20 mmHg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) >15 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) <3 Wood units (WU) (ii) Cpc-PH group; mPAP >20 mmHg, PAWP >15 mmHg, and PVR ≥3 WU (iii) borderline-PH group; mPAP >20 mmHg and PAWP ≤15 mmHg (iv) non-PH group; mPAP ≤20 mmHg. Multivariate Cox hazard analysis was used to investigate whether Cpc-PH was associated with cardiac outcomes.The study subjects were allocated into the Ipc-PH (n = 268), Cpc-PH (n = 54), borderline-PH (n = 112), or non-PH (n = 267) groups. The Cpc-PH group was associated significantly with adverse cardiac events even after adjustment for clinically relevant confounding factors for heart failure prognosis (vs. non-PH group: HR 2.98 [95% CI 1.81-4.90], P <0.001; vs. Ipc-PH group: HR: 1.92 [95% CI 1.19-3.08], P = 0.007).The new definitions of PH-LHD stratified patients into 4 categories. Long-term clinical outcomes were significantly different between the four categories, with Cpc-PH having the worst cardiac outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3134375378,"Tinnitus and pain have many similarities. Both are subjective sensations that may turn chronic, they are often accompanied by hypersensitivity in their respective sensory system, and overlapping brain changes have been observed. Since no population study has examined the empirical association between chronic pain and tinnitus, the present study aimed to explore the relationship in a general adult population. We used data from the seventh survey of the Tromsø Study (2015-2016). Participants (aged ≥40) responded to questions about pain and tinnitus. Using multiple logistic regression, we analysed the adjusted relationship between chronic pain and tinnitus in the full sample (n = 19,039), using several tinnitus definitions ranging from tinnitus >5 minutes within the past 12 months (broadest definition) to at least weekly and highly bothersome tinnitus (strictest definition). We also analysed relationships between number of body regions with pain, pain intensity and bothering, and tinnitus >5 minutes, among participants with chronic pain (n = 11,589). We found an association between chronic pain and tinnitus that was present irrespective of tinnitus definition, but was stronger with more bothersome tinnitus. With chronic pain, the odds of tinnitus >5 minutes was 64% higher, while odds of at least weekly, highly bothersome tinnitus was 144% higher than without chronic pain. Among participants with chronic pain, the number of pain regions was the pain variable most strongly associated with tinnitus >5 minutes (OR = 1.17 (95% CI: 1.14-1.20) for an increase of one region), whereas the other pain variables (intensity and bothering) showed weaker associations. All chronic pain variables had significant interactions with age, with the strongest associations for the youngest individuals (40-54 years). Our findings support the existence of an association between chronic pain and tinnitus and emphasises the importance of examining for comorbid pain in tinnitus patients to provide a more comprehensive treatment of tinnitus."
https://openalex.org/W3080536620,"The Department of Energy conduced ten large-scale neutron irradiation experiments at Argonne National Laboratory between 1972 and 1989. Using a new approach to utilize experimental controls to determine whether a cross comparison between experiments was appropriate, we amalgamated data on neutron exposures to discover that fractionation significantly improved overall survival. A more detailed investigation showed that fractionation only had a significant impact on the death hazard for animals that died from solid tumors, but did not significantly impact any other causes of death. Additionally, we compared the effects of sex, age first irradiated, and radiation fractionation on neutron irradiated mice versus cobalt 60 gamma irradiated mice and found that solid tumors were the most common cause of death in neutron irradiated mice, while lymphomas were the dominant cause of death in gamma irradiated mice. Most animals in this study were irradiated before 150 days of age but a subset of mice was first exposed to gamma or neutron irradiation over 500 days of age. Advanced age played a significant role in decreasing the death hazard for neutron irradiated mice, but not for gamma irradiated mice. Mice that were 500 days old before their first exposures to neutrons began dying later than both sham irradiated or gamma irradiated mice."
https://openalex.org/W3134743179,"Do individuals modify their bodies in order to be unique? The present study sought to investigate need for uniqueness (NfU) subcomponents as possible motives for modifying one’s body. To this end, the study obtained information from 312 participants about their NfU (using the German NfU-G global scale and three sub-scales) and their body modifications (tattoos, piercings, and extreme body modifications such as tongue splitting). By analyzing the three subcomponents of NfU, the study was able to investigate the differential relationship of the sub-scales with the outcome measures, which facilitated a fine-grained understanding of the NfU–body-modification relationship. The study found that tattooed, pierced, and extreme-body-modified individuals had higher NfU-G scores than individuals without body modifications. Moreover, it seemed that individuals with tattoos took a social component into consideration while lacking concern regarding others’ reaction toward their tattoos, although not wanting to cause affront. Pierced and extreme-body-modified individuals, contrarily, tended to display a propensity to actively flout rules and not worry about others’ opinions on their modifications. However, although statistically significant, the effect size ( d ) for the NfU-G differences in the tattooed and pierced participants’ mean scores was small to medium in all three subcomponents. The extreme-body-modified group presented medium and medium to large effects. Further, the study observed that the number of body modifications increased with an increasing NfU in tattooed and pierced individuals. These findings demonstrated multifaceted interrelations between the NfU, its subcomponents, and the three kinds of body modifications investigated in the present study."
https://openalex.org/W3134931965,"Background Isolated or multi lineage cytopenia are the most common clinicopathological features and independently associated with increased risk of disease progression and death among human immunodeficiency virus infected children. In the study area, there is scarcity of data about the magnitude of various cytopenia. Objectives Aimed to determine the magnitude and associated factors of peripheral cytopenia among HIV infected children at the University of Gondar Specialized Referral Hospital ART clinic, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on 255 HIV infected children from January- April 2020. None probable convenient sampling technique was used to select the study participant. Socio demographic data were collected by pre tested structured questionnaire via face-to-face interview and their medical data were obtained from their follow-up medical records. Moreover, blood specimens were collected and examined for complete blood count, viral load and blood film, whereas stool specimens were collected and examined for intestinal parasites. Bi-variable and multi-variable logistic regression models were fitted to identify associated factors of cytopenia. P-Value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result The overall magnitude of peripheral cytopenia was 38.9%. Anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and bi-cytopenia were 21.2%, 12.2%, 11%, 1.6% and 3.9% respectively. Being in the age group of 2–10 years (AOR = 5.38, 95%CI 2.33–12.46), AZT based regimen (AOR = 5.44, 95%CI: 2.24–13.21), no eating green vegetables (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.26–4.92) and having plasma viral load &gt;1000 copies /ml (AOR = 5.38, 95%CI: 2.22–13.03) showed significant association with anemia. Conclusion Anemia was the predominant peripheral cytopenia among HIV infected children in this study. It was strongly associated with AZT based drug type, age below 10 years and high viral load. Critical stress should be given for early investigation and management of cytopenia in addition to the use of alternative drug which leads to higher viral suppression and lower risk of toxicity issue."

Objectives To assess intention to voluntary blood donation among private higher education students in Jimma Town, South West Ethiopia, 2019. Methods Institution-based cross-sectional study with quantitative methods was conducted in private higher education students in Jimma town. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. First, a simple random sampling technique was used to select departments in each private higher education institution. Seven departments were included in the study and after proportionally allocated in each department, a total of 595 were participated in the study, producing a response rate of 98%. The data was collected using self-administered structured questioners with 3 trained data collectors. Multivariable linear regression analysis was done to assess association between the independent variables and dependent variable. Results The mean score for intention of the respondents to donate blood voluntarily was 15.41 out of 25 with standard deviation of 4.42.The TPB variables explained 61.3% of the variance of intention to donate blood. Direct perceived behavioral control (β = 0.745, P &lt; 0.001), direct attitude (B = 0.295, P&lt;0.001) and direct subjective norm (β = 0.131, P&lt; 0.001) were significant predictors of the intention.

https://openalex.org/W3133532675,"The glass cliff suggests that women are more likely to access leadership positions when organizations are facing a crisis. Although this phenomenon is well established, it is still largely unknown how variations in types of crises influence the strength of the think crisis-think female association, and whether female leaders and leaders with communal gendered traits are both affected by this association. We hypothesized that selection of stereotypically feminine traits (communal leaders) is specific to a relational crisis because of a fit between leader traits and traits required by the situation. We further expected that the selection of women also extends to other crisis situations because other factors such as their signaling change potential may play a role. We investigated the associations that participants made with candidates who varied across gendered traits and gender and between two crisis situations involving problems with either stereotypically feminine (e.g., an internal disharmony) or masculine (e.g., a financial problem) components, and a no crisis situation control. Results from three experimental studies ( N s = 319, 384, 385) supported our hypotheses by showing that communal leaders were most strongly associated with a relational crisis and least with a financial crisis, with the no crisis context situated in-between. This pattern was explained by higher relevance ratings for communal leadership behavior in the relational crisis versus financial crisis context, with the no crisis context situated in-between. In contrast, female leaders were most strongly associated with the relational crisis and least with the no crisis context, with the financial crisis situated in-between. Specific explanatory mechanisms related to the female-crisis association are explored and discussed. Our findings suggest that implicit motivations for valuing feminine/communal leadership and atypical leaders in crisis situations need further research."
https://openalex.org/W3134168233,"Resistin is a small, cysteine-rich proinflammatory molecule that is primarily secreted by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages in humans. Previous studies have shown resistin to participate in various pathological processes including atherosclerosis and cancer progression but not many studies have assessed the role of resistin as a risk factor for all-cause mortality. The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate whether resistin predicts mortality among elderly Finnish people.The study population consisted of 599 elderly (71.7 ± 5.4 years) patients and the follow-up was approximately six years. A thorough clinical examination including anthropometric and other clinical measurements such as blood pressure as well as various laboratory parameters (including resistin) was conducted at baseline.After the follow-up, 65 (11%) of the patients died. Resistin was a significant risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 3.02, 95% CI: 1.64-5.56, p<0.001) when the highest tertile was compared to the lowest. Resistin remained as a significant risk factor even after adjusting for various covariates such as age, sex, systolic blood pressure, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, medications (antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, glucose-lowering), hsCRP and leisure time physical activity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for resistin demonstrated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.656 (95% CI: 0.577-0.734), p<0.001 and an optimal cutoff value of 12.88 ng/ml.Our results indicate that resistin is a significant risk factor for all-cause mortality among elderly Finnish subjects, independent from traditional cardiovascular risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3134982678,"Modulation of neuronal excitability is a prominent way of shaping the activity of neuronal networks. Recent studies highlight the role of calcium-activated chloride currents in this context, as they can both increase or decrease excitability. The calcium-activated chloride channel Anoctamin 2 (ANO2 alias TMEM16B) has been described in several regions of the mouse brain, including the olivo-cerebellar system. In inferior olivary neurons, ANO2 was proposed to increase excitability by facilitating the generation of high-threshold calcium spikes. An expression of ANO2 in cerebellar Purkinje cells was suggested, but its role in these neurons remains unclear. In the present study, we confirmed the expression of Ano2 mRNA in Purkinje cells and performed electrophysiological recordings to examine the influence of ANO2-chloride channels on the excitability of Purkinje cells by comparing wildtype mice to mice lacking ANO2. Recordings were performed in acute cerebellar slices of adult mice, which provided the possibility to study the role of ANO2 within the cerebellar cortex. Purkinje cells were uncoupled from climbing fiber input to assess specifically the effect of ANO2 channels on Purkinje cell activity. We identified an attenuating effect of ANO2-mediated chloride currents on the instantaneous simple spike activity both during strong current injections and during current injections close to the simple spike threshold. Moreover, we report a reduction of inhibitory currents from GABAergic interneurons upon depolarization, lasting for several seconds. Together with the role of ANO2-chloride channels in inferior olivary neurons, our data extend the evidence for a role of chloride-dependent modulation in the olivo-cerebellar system that might be important for proper cerebellum-dependent motor coordination and learning."
https://openalex.org/W3135558923,"Self-administered massage interventions with a roller massager are commonly used as part of warm-ups and post-workout recovery routines. There is yet no clear consensus regarding the practical guidelines for efficient embedded interventions.The present randomized crossover pilot trial aimed at examining the effects of a rolling intervention with a roller massager embedded within the rests periods of a resistance training protocol. The rolling intervention targeted quadriceps muscles.Participants (n = 14) performed two resistance training protocols expected to elicit momentary muscle failure. The protocol consisted in 10 sets of 10 rest-pause repetitions of back squats, with a poundage set up at 50% of the maximal one-repetition. Two min were allocated to recovery between sets. During the recovery periods, participants completed a rolling routine with a roller massager for 60 s (Roller-massager), or underwent passive recovery (Control). The total workload, concentric power, thigh circumference rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) from 24 h to 120 h after completion of the protocol were the dependent variables.Roller-massager was associated with a reduction in total workload (-11.6%), concentric power (-5.1%) and an increase in perceived exertion compared to Control (p < 0.05). Roller-massager was also associated with reduced thigh circumference after the resistance training protocol, indicating reduced muscle swelling, and reduced DOMS 24 h to 120 h post-workout (p < 0.001).These findings support that embedded rolling with a roller massager hinders performance and increases effort perception. Embedded interventions may not be suitable during conditioning periods designed to maximize training intensity."
https://openalex.org/W3135639682,"To understand the impact and causes of 'Failure to Attend' (FTA) labelling, of patients with chronic conditions.Nurse navigators are registered nurses employed by public hospitals in Queensland, Australia, to coordinate the care of patients with multiple chronic conditions, who frequently miss hospital appointments. The role of the nurse navigator is to improve care management of these patients. Evidence for this is measured through improvement in patient self-management of their conditions, a reduction in preventable hospital admissions and compliance with attendance at outpatient clinics. Failure to attend (FTA) is one measure of hospital utilisation, identifying outpatient appointments that are cancelled or not attended.The cohort for this study was patients with multiple chronic conditions, and nurse navigators coordinating their care. Data describing the concept of FTA were thematically analysed twelve months into this three year evaluation.Although the patient is blamed for failing to attend appointments, the reasons appear to be a mixture of systems error/miscommunication between the patient and the health services or social reasons impacting on patient's capacity to attend. Themes emerging from the data were: access barriers; failure to recognise personal stigma of FTA; and bridging the gap.The nurse navigators demonstrate their pivotal role in engaging with outpatient services to reduce FTAs whilst helping patients to become confident in dealing with multiple appointments. There are many reasons why a patient is unable to attend a scheduled appointment. The phrase 'Failure to Attend' has distinctly negative connotations and can lead to a sense of blame and shame for those with complex chronic needs. We propose the use of the neutral phrase ""appointment did not proceed"" to replace FTA.This article advocates for further consideration of collaborative models that engage the patient in their care journey and for consideration of the language used within the outpatient acute hospital setting, proposing the term 'appointment did not proceed.'"
https://openalex.org/W3133544548,"The expression of some chemokines and chemokine receptors is induced during the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), but their involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease is unclear. The goal of this study was to test whether CCL21 and CXCL13 play a role in PTOA development. For this purpose, we evaluated the expression profiles of the chemokines Ccl21 and Cxcl13, matrix metalloproteinase enzymes Mmp3 and Mmp13, and inflammatory cell markers in response to partial medial meniscectomy and destabilization (MMD). We then assessed the effect of local administration of CCL21 neutralizing antibody on PTOA development and post-knee injury inflammation. The mRNA expression of both Ccl21 and Cxcl13 was induced early post-surgery, but only Ccl21 mRNA levels remained elevated 4 weeks post-surgery in rat MMD-operated knees compared to controls. This suggests that while both CXCL13 and CCL21 are involved in post-surgery inflammation, CCL21 is necessary for development of PTOA. A significant increase in the mRNA levels of Cd4, Cd8 and Cd20 was observed during the first 3 days post-surgery. Significantly, treatment with CCL21 antibody reduced post-surgical inflammation that was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of Mmp3 and Mmp13 and post-MMD cartilage degradation. Our findings are consistent with a role for CCL21 in mediating changes in early inflammation and subsequent cartilage degeneration in response to knee injury. Our results suggest that targeting CCL21 signaling pathways may yield new therapeutic approaches effective in delaying or preventing PTOA development following injury."
https://openalex.org/W3135297633,"Engulfment requires the coordinated, targeted synthesis and degradation of peptidoglycan at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane to allow the mother cell to completely engulf the forespore. Proteins such as the DMP and Q:AH complexes in Bacillus subtilis are essential for engulfment, as are a set of accessory proteins including GerM and SpoIIB, among others. Experimental and bioinformatic studies of these proteins in bacteria distinct from Bacillus subtilis indicate that fundamental differences exist regarding the organization and mechanisms used to successfully perform engulfment. As a consequence, the distribution and prevalence of the proteins involved in engulfment and other proteins that participate in different sporulation stages have been studied using bioinformatic approaches. These works are based on the prediction of orthologs in the genomes of representative Firmicutes and have been helpful in tracing hypotheses about the origin and evolution of sporulation genes, some of which have been postulated as sporulation signatures. To date, an extensive study of these signatures outside of the representative Firmicutes is not available. Here, we asked whether phyletic profiles of proteins involved in engulfment can be used as signatures able to describe the sporulation phenotype. We tested this hypothesis in a set of 954 Firmicutes, finding preserved phyletic profiles defining signatures at the genus level. Finally, a phylogenetic reconstruction based on non-redundant phyletic profiles at the family level shows the non-monophyletic origin of these proteins due to gain/loss events along the phylum Firmicutes."

https://openalex.org/W3135876263,"Tramadol is used as an analgesic in humans and some animal species. When tramadol is administered to most species it undergoes metabolism to its main metabolites M1 or O-desmethyltramadol, and M2 or N-desmethyltramadol, and many other metabolites. This study describes the pharmacokinetic profile of tramadol when a single subcutaneous bolus of 2 mg/kg was initially administered to two koalas. Based on the results of these two koalas, subsequently 4 mg/kg as a single subcutaneous injection, was administered to an additional four koalas. M1 is recognised as an active metabolite and has greater analgesic activity than tramadol, while M2 is considered inactive. A liquid chromatography assay to quantify tramadol, M1 and M2 in koala plasma was developed and validated. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed that M1 had been identified. Additionally, the metabolite didesmethyltramadol was identified in chromatograms of two of the male koalas. When 4 mg/kg tramadol was administered, the median half-life of tramadol and M1 were 2.89 h and 24.69 h, respectively. The M1 plasma concentration remained well above the minimally effective M1 plasma concentration in humans (approximately 36 ng/mL) over 12 hours. The M1 plasma concentration, when tramadol was administered at 2 mg/kg, did not exceed 36 ng/mL at any time-point. When tramadol was administered at 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg the area under the curve M1: tramadol ratios were 0.33 and 0.50, respectively. Tramadol and M1 binding to plasma protein were determined using thawed, frozen koala plasma and the mean binding was 20% and 75%, respectively. It is concluded that when tramadol is administered at 4 mg/kg as a subcutaneous injection to the koala, it is predicted to have some analgesic activity."

This study aimed to evaluate factors affecting the PTBD duration in patients who underwent percutaneous treatment of common bile duct (CBD) stones. This study analyzed data of 169 patients who underwent percutaneous treatment of CBD stones from June 2009 to June 2019. Demographic data, characteristics of stone, procedure-related factors, and laboratory findings before the insertion of PTBD tubes were retrospectively evaluated. To assess the effect of confounding factors on the PTBD duration, multivariate linear regression analysis was applied, incorporating significant predictive factors identified in the univariate regression analysis. In the univariate regression analysis, the predictive factor that showed high correlation with the PTBD duration was the initial total bilirubin level (coefficient = 0.68, P < .001) followed by the short diameter of the largest stone (coefficient = 0.19, P = .056), and previous endoscopic sphincterotomy (coefficient = -2.50, P = .086). The multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the initial total bilirubin level (coefficient = 0.50, P < .001) and short diameter of the largest stone (coefficient = 0.16, P = .025) were significantly related to the PTBD duration. The total bilirubin level before PTBD tube insertion and the short diameter of the largest CBD stone were predictive factors for the PTBD duration in patients who underwent percutaneous CBD stone removal. Careful assessment of these factors might help in predicting the treatment period, thereby improving the quality of patient care."

(Hemiptera: Aphididae) is one of the factors limiting carrot production in Poland. Planting resistant and tolerant cultivars could reduce yield losses due to the damage caused by this pest. This study was conducted to evaluate the resistance and/or tolerance of 10 carrot genotypes to hawthorn-carrot aphid. Their field resistance was determined under field conditions based on five indicators, namely, mean number of alates (migrants) per plant and mean percentage of plants colonized by them, mean seasonal number of aphids per plant, mean number of aphids per plant and mean percentage of infested plants at peak abundance. Antibiosis experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions and pre-reproductive, reproductive time, fertility, and demographic parameters, represented by the net reproduction rate (Ro), intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and mean generation time (T), were calculated. Five cultivars, Afro F1, Nipomo F1, Samba F1, White Satin F1, and Yellowstone showed field resistance. Antibiosis experiments revealed significant differences among the carrot cultivars in the length of the reproductive period, female fecundity in the time equal to the pre-reproduction time, and total progeny of hawthorn-carrot aphid. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) for apterous aphids varied significantly, ranging between 0.181 (Nipomo F1) and 0.343 females/female/day (White Satin F1). Additionally, the estimated net reproductive rate (R0) was the lowest on Nipomo F1, and this genotype was determined to be resistant. Our results suggest that a very high density of trichomes on the leaf petioles (71.94 trichomes/cm2) could adversely affect the feeding, bionomy, and demographic parameters of hawthorn-carrot aphid on the cultivar Nipomo F1. In addition, Napa F1 and Kongo F1 demonstrated high tolerance. Considering all the results collectively, four genotypes, Afro F1, Kongo F1, Napa F1 and Nipomo F1, were relatively resistant/tolerant to the hawthorn-carrot aphid."

Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of T . gondii infection in college students at Anhui province, China and to assess risk factors for T . gondii infection in college students. Moreover, growing studies demonstrated the association between T . gondii infection and host behavioral changes. We also studied the linkage between T . gondii and physical education (PE) scores of college students. Methods A total of 2704 serum samples of medical school students attending physical education lessons were collected from September 2017 to September 2019 and evaluated for T . gondii IgG antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Questionnaires and statistical analysis were used to determine the risk factors for T . gondii infection. We also analysed PE scores of T . gondii -infected students and T . gondii -uninfected students. Results The overall seroprevalence of T . gondii was 11.5%. The main risk factors related to T . gondii infection in college students were cat in the household and gardening or agriculture activity. Furthermore, in the basketball group and the soccer group, scores of T . gondii seropositive students were significantly higher than those of seronegative students, while in other sports there was no difference between scores of T . gondii -infected students and T . gondii uninfected students.

https://openalex.org/W3135145474,"The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is known to play a causal role in the promotion of cancer, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be completely understood. Interplay between endogenous and environmental cues determines the fate of cancer development. The Eμ- myc transgenic mouse expresses elevated levels of c-Myc in the B cell lineage and develops B cell lymphomas with associated mutations in p53 or other genes linked to apoptosis. We generated Eμ- myc mice that either lacked the IL-6 gene, or lacked the STAT3 gene specifically in B cells to determine the role of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway in tumor development. Using the Eμ-myc lymphoma mouse model, we demonstrate that IL-6 is a critical tumor promoter during early stages of B cell lymphomagenesis. IL-6 is shown to inhibit the expression of tumor suppressors, notably BIM and PTEN, and this may contribute to advancing MYC-driven B cell tumorigenesis. Several miRNAs known to target BIM and PTEN are upregulated by IL-6 and likely lead to the stable suppression of pro-apoptotic pathways early during the tumorigenic process. STAT3, a classical downstream effector of IL-6, appears dispensable for Eμ-myc driven lymphomagenesis. We conclude that the growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic mechanisms activated by IL-6 are critically involved in Eμ-myc driven tumor initiation and progression, but the B cell intrinsic expression of STAT3 is not required."

We explore this question through an analysis of a large dataset of approximately one million contestants playing Fantasy Premier League, an online fantasy sport where managers choose players from the English football (soccer) league. We show that managers' ranks over multiple seasons are correlated and we analyse the actions taken by managers to increase their likelihood of success. The prime factors in determining a manager's success are found to be long-term planning and consistently good decision-making in the face of the noisy contests upon which this game is based. Similarities between managers' decisions over time that result in the emergence of 'template' teams, suggesting a form of herding dynamics taking place within the game, are also observed. Taken together, these findings indicate common strategic considerations and consensus among successful managers on crucial decision points over an extended temporal period."

Five fine epitopes (E1, 196FSQSEFPD203; E2, 232GHSHKII238; E3, 256VCYKEGTGPC265; E4, 285FCKVAG290, and E5, 316SYGGM320) were identified using the rabbit antisera. Western blot analysis showed that all the five epitopes interacted with the positive serum of sheep that had been naturally infected with SFTSV. Three-dimensional structural modeling analysis showed that all identified BCEs were located on the surface of the SFTSV-Gn and contained flexible loops. The sequence alignment revealed high conservation of the identified BCEs among 13 SFTSV strains from different lineage. These mapped epitopes will escalate the understanding of the epitope distribution and pathogenic mechanism of SFTSV, and could provide a basis for the development of a SFTSV multi-epitope detection antigen."
https://openalex.org/W3133857513,"Xpert ® MTB/RIF has been widely used for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in Brazil, since 2014. This prospective observational study aimed to evaluate the performance of Xpert in different contexts during a two-year period: (i) laboratory and clinical/epidemiological diagnosis; (ii) HIV-positive and -negative populations; (iii) type of specimens: pulmonary and extrapulmonary. Overall, 924 specimens from 743 patients were evaluated. The performance of the assays was evaluated considering culture (Lowenstein Jensen or LJ medium) results and composite reference standard (CRS) classification as gold standard. According to CRS evaluation, 219 cases (29.5%) were classified as positive cases, 157 (21.1%) as ‘possible TB’, and 367 (49.3%) as ‘not TB’. Based on culture, Xpert and AFB smear achieved a sensitivity of 96% and 62%, respectively, while based on CRS, the sensitivities of Xpert, AFB smear, and culture were 40.7%, 20%, and 25%, respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of Xpert were 96% and 94%, respectively. Metric evaluations were similar between pulmonary and extrapulmonary samples against culture, whereas compared to CRS, the sensitivities were 44.6% and 29.3% for the pulmonary and extrapulmonary cases, respectively. The Xpert detected 42/69 (60.9%) patients with confirmed TB and negative culture on LJ medium, and 52/69 (75.4%) patients with negative AFB smear results. There was no significant difference in the diagnostic accuracy based on the types of specimens and population (positive- and negative-HIV). Molecular testing detected 13 cases of TB in culture-negative patients with severe immunosuppression. Resistance to rifampicin was detected in seven samples. Herein, Xpert showed improved detection of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB cases, both among HIV-positive and -negative patients, even in cases with advanced immunosuppression, thereby performing better than multiple other diagnostic parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3134486584,"The Stroop task is a traditional measure of cognitive control processes, yet results remain mixed when it comes to assessing age-related differences perhaps in part due to strategies participants use to reduce inhibitory control demands required for success on the task. Thirty-three older adults and 34 younger adults completed a Baseline (traditional, single-task) version of Stroop, followed by two, novel dual-task Stroop variants: Color-Dual (maintain secondary count of prespecified font color regardless the lexical content) and Lexical-Dual (maintain secondary count of prespecified word regardless the font color). With regard to Baseline performance, we predicted an Age x Trial Type interaction in which older adults would be selectively impaired on Incongruent trials compared to younger adults, and this prediction was supported. When we added secondary task demands, we predicted a Trial Type x Dual-Task Type interaction in which performance in the Lexical-Dual condition would be worse than performance in the Color-Dual condition. This prediction was also supported, suggesting that having a secondary task that activated the irrelevant stream of information required more inhibitory control. Finally, we also predicted that Age would interact with Trial Type and Dual-Task Type, which was partially supported in response latencies and more definitively supported in error rates. Overall, our results indicate that Stroop performance is differentially influenced by additional dual-task demands that potentially minimize strategy usage, which has implications for both young and older adult Stroop performance."
https://openalex.org/W3134996178,"The availability of reliable socioeconomic data is critical for the design of urban policies and the implementation of location-based services; however, often, their temporal and geographical coverage remain scarce. We explore the potential for insurance customers data to predict socioeconomic indicators of Swiss municipalities. First, we define a features space by aggregating at city-level individual customer data along several behavioral and user profile dimensions. Second, we collect official statistics shared by the Swiss authorities on a wide spectrum of categories: Population, Transportation, Work, Space and Territory, Housing, and Economy. Third, we adopt two spatial regression models exploring both global and local geographical dependencies to investigate their predictability. Results show consistently a correlation between insurance customer characteristics and official socioeconomic indexes. Performance fluctuates depending on the category, with values of R 2 &gt; 0.6 for several target variables using a 5-fold cross validation. As a case study, we focus on predicting the percentage of the population using public transportation and we discuss the implications on a regional scope. We believe that this methodology can support official statistical offices and it could open up new opportunities for the characterization of socioeconomic traits at highly-granular spatial and temporal scales."
https://openalex.org/W3135485977,"335-330 million-year-old cherts from the Massif Central, France, contain exceptionally well-preserved remains of an early forest ecosystem, including plants, fungi and other microorganisms. Here we reinvestigate the original material prepared by Renault and Roche from collections of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, and present a re-evaluation of Oochytrium lepidodendri (Renault 1894), originally described as a zoosporic fungus. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to study the microfossils, enabling us in software to digitally reconstruct them in three-dimensional detail. We reinterpret O. lepidodendri as a pseudofungus and favour placement within the oomycetes, a diverse clade of saprotrophs and both animal and plant parasites. Phylogenetically, O. lepidodendri appears to belong to a group of oomycetes distinct from those previously described from Paleozoic rocks and most likely related to the Peronosporales s.l. This study adds to our knowledge of Paleozoic eukaryotic diversity and reinforces the view that oomycetes were early and diverse constituents of terrestrial biotas, playing similar ecological roles to those they perform in modern ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3133964909,"Aiming at the problem of resource allocation for departure flights at congested airports, this research explores the optimal configuration of holding units in the terminal control area (TCA). Similar to the job-shop scheduling problem, this problem is solved through a max-plus model with additional constraints. In particular, two optimization models are constructed, in which air segments, departure fixes and holding units are explicitly modeled. Based on the realistic airspace network selected, the proposed models are tested using actual flight data. The experimental results show that the models proposed have better qualities compared with the other methods."
https://openalex.org/W3134960902,"Social cognition might be impaired in first degree relatives (FDR) of BD but existing research shows controversial results about social cognitive impairments in this population. The aim of this study was to assess Theory of Mind (ToM) and nonverbal sensitivity in FDR of BD and compare the results with those of two groups of persons with remitted bipolar disorder (BD), type I and II, and a control group. Social cognitive ability was examined in first degree relatives of BD, with a biological parent, offspring or sibling diagnosed with the disorder. For this study, 37 FDRs of bipolar patients, 37 BD I, 40 BD II and 40 control participants were recruited. Social cognition was explored by means of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the MiniPONS. Results showed a significant impairment in FDR of BD in the ToM task, but not in nonverbal sensitivity. Performance of FDRs in social cognition is better than that of BDs (either type I or type II) but worse when compared with that of healthy individuals without a family history of psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, no differences were found between BD I and BD II groups. Males and older participants showed a worse performance in all groups. Group family therapy with FDRs of BD might include training in the recognition of nonverbal cues, which might increase the understanding of their familiars with BD, in order to modify communication abilities."
