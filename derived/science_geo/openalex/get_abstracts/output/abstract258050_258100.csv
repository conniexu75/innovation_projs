https://openalex.org/W2164663878,"Adiponectin functions as an insulin sensitizer, and yet the underlying molecular mechanism(s) remains largely unknown. We found that treating C2C12 myotubes with adiponectin or rapamycin enhanced the ability of insulin to stimulate IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation, concurrently with reduced p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation at Thr389 as well as IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser302 and Ser636/639. Overexpression of dominant-negative AMP kinase (AMPK), but not dominant-negative p38 MAPK, reduced the insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin. Rapamycin, but not adiponectin, enhanced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in HeLa cells, which lack LKB1, and exogenous expression of LKB1 in HeLa cells rescued the insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin. Finally, overexpression of wild-type Rheb (Ras homology-enriched in brain) or the TSC2 mutant lacking the AMPK phosphorylation site (TSC2S1345A) inhibited the insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin in C2C12 cells. These results indicate that activation of the LKB1/AMPK/TSC1/2 pathway alleviates the p70 S6 kinase-mediated negative regulation of insulin signaling, providing a mechanism by which adiponectin increases insulin sensitivity in cells.

Adiponectin (Acrp30, AdipoQ, ApM1, and GBP28) is a collagen-like adipokine that has anti-atherogenic, antidiabetic, and insulin-sensitizing properties (1Bouskila M. Pajvani U.B. Scherer P.E. Int. J.

Mice lacking adiponectin have severe hepatic insulin resistance (4Nawrocki A.R. Rajala M.W. Tomas E. Pajvani U.B. Saha A.K. Trumbauer M.E. Pang Z. Chen A.S. Ruderman N.B. Chen H. Rossetti L.

In humans, adiponectin levels are low in the plasma of obese and type 2 diabetes subjects (6Hotta K. Funahashi T. Bodkin N.L. Ortmeyer H.K. Arita Y. Hansen B.C. Matsuzawa Y.

The molecular mechanism by which adiponectin acts as an insulin sensitizer remains largely unknown. Insulin initiates its action by binding to its membrane receptor, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the insulin receptor (IR). 2The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; AMPK, AMP kinase; DN, dominant negative; IRS, IR substrate; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; Rheb, Ras homology enriched in brain; S6K, p70 S6 kinase; TORC, TOR complex; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. A major pathway downstream of IR is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which mediates insulin-stimulated GLUT4 membrane translocation and glucose uptake. Recent studies have shown that the PI3K pathway is negatively regulated by the TOR complex 1 (TORC1)-induced signaling pathway, which is mediated by the S6K-dependent phosphorylation of IRS-1 at several sites including Ser302, Ser307, and Ser636/639 (9Haruta T.

The inhibitory effect of S6K is greatly enhanced in cells lacking the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2), suggesting that TSC1/2 is a negative regulator of the mTOR/S6K signaling pathway (13Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Gray A. Tolkacheva T. Wigfield S. Rebholz H. Barnett J. Leslie N.R. Cheng S. Shepherd P.R. Gout I. Downes C.P. Lamb R.F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TSC1/2 activity is stimulated by AMP kinase (AMPK) (14Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar), a heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein kinase, which is activated by adiponectin (15Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S. Sugiyama T. Miyagishi M. Hara K. Tsunoda M. Murakami K. Ohteki T. Uchida S. Takekawa S. Waki H. Tsuno N.H. Shibata Y. Terauchi Y. Froguel P. Tobe K. Koyasu S. Taira K. Kitamura T. Shimizu T. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. Nature. 2003; 423: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). However, whether activation of AMPK by adiponectin leads to inhibition of S6K and whether this inhibition plays a role in the insulin sensitizing effect of adiponectin remain unknown. In the present study, we have shown that adiponectin sensitizes insulin signaling in C2C12 myotubes. In addition, we found that treatment of cells with adiponectin inhibits S6K phosphorylation at Thr389, an indicator of reduced S6K activity. The insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin was suppressed in cells lacking TSC1/2 or LKB1, or overexpressing Rheb, a dominant-negative (DN) form of AMPK, or a mutant TSC2 lacking the AMPK phosphorylation site (TSC2S1345A). These results indicate that activation of the LKB1/AMPK/TSC pathway, which relieves the negative regulation of mTOR/S6K via inhibition of Rheb, may provide a molecular mechanism by which adiponectin increases insulin sensitivity in cells. Reagents—Rapamycin was purchased from Sigma. Anti-IRS-1 and anti-IR antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies and phosphospecific antibodies for Akt, p70S6K, AMPK, p38 MAPK, and IRS-1 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). His-tagged gAdiponectin was produced as described in our recent work (16Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Plasmids—cDNAs encoding full-length LKB1 or Akt were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) (Invitrogen). Plasmids encoding Wt-TSC2 and Mut-TSC2 (S1345A) tagged with hemagglutinin constructs were described previously (14Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding wild-type AMPK and DN-AMPK (K45R), wild-type and DN-p38 MAPK, and wild-type and DN-Rheb (D60K) were generous gifts from Drs. Michael Quon, Jiahuai Han, and Jie Chen, respectively. Cell Lines, Transfection, and Western Blot—C2C12 cells were maintained in DMEM (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Differentiation of C2C12 cells to myotubes was done by growing cells in low-serum medium (98% DMEM, 2% (v/v) horse serum, 4.0 mm glutamine, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). TSC1–/–, TSC2–/–, and wild-type control mouse embryonic fibroblasts were generous gifts of Dr. David Kwiatkowski (17Zhang H. Cicchetti G. Onda H. Koon H.B. Asrican K. Bajraszewski N. Vazquez F. Carpenter C.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were normally serum-starved for 4–6 h before treatment. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, the cell lysates were denatured, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot using specific antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Western blot results are typically representative of at least three independent experiments with similar results. Quantification and Statistics—Quantification of the relative increase in insulin-stimulated protein phosphorylation was performed by analyzing Western blots using the Scion Image software and was normalized with the amount of protein expression in each experiment. Values presented are mean values ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the insulin sensitizing effect of adiponectin, we treated C2C12 myotubes with insulin in the absence or presence of the globular form of adiponectin (gAd), which has been shown to bind to the adiponectin receptor-1 (AdipoR1) with a higher affinity than the full-length adiponectin (15Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S. Sugiyama T. Miyagishi M. Hara K. Tsunoda M. Murakami K. Ohteki T. Uchida S. Takekawa S. Waki H. Tsuno N.H. Shibata Y. Terauchi Y. Froguel P. Tobe K. Koyasu S. Taira K. Kitamura T. Shimizu T. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. Nature. 2003; 423: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). As expected, treatment of cells with insulin led to increased IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A, lane 2, and B, lane 3). Insulin-stimulated IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation was markedly increased in cells pretreated with adiponectin (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–5) or the S6K inhibitor rapamycin (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6). A similar increase in insulin-stimulated IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation was also observed in mouse hepatocytes pretreated with full-length adiponectin (data not shown). Interestingly, the adiponectin or rapamycin-enhanced insulin signaling correlated with a reduction of S6K phosphorylation at Thr389, which also correlated with S6K activity (Fig. 1A and B, fifth panel from top). Because activation of S6K has been shown to negatively regulate insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signaling (12Werner E.D. Lee J. Hansen L. Yuan M. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35298-35305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Gray A. Tolkacheva T. Wigfield S. Rebholz H. Barnett J. Leslie N.R. Cheng S. Shepherd P.R. Gout I. Downes C.P. Lamb R.F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), these results suggest that adiponectin may increase insulin sensitivity by alleviating the inhibitory effect of S6K. Consistent with this idea, suppression of S6K1 levels has been shown to significantly improve insulin sensitivity (18Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that pretreatment of cells with rapamycin blunted the insulin sensitizing effect of adiponectin (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, treatment of C2C12 myotubes with adiponectin had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated IR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin directly targets IRS-1 rather than the IR. Adiponectin activates two major pathways in muscle cells, the AMPK and the p38 MAPK signaling pathways (15Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S. Sugiyama T. Miyagishi M. Hara K. Tsunoda M. Murakami K. Ohteki T. Uchida S. Takekawa S. Waki H. Tsuno N.H. Shibata Y. Terauchi Y. Froguel P. Tobe K. Koyasu S. Taira K. Kitamura T. Shimizu T. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. Nature. 2003; 423: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). To determine whether any or both of these signaling pathways are involved in mediating the insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin, we overexpressed DN-AMPK (19Zong H. Ren J.M. Young L.H. Pypaert M. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. Shulman G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15983-15987Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) or DN-p38 MAPK (20Fujii R. Yamashita S. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1335-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in C2C12 cells. We found that overexpression of DN-AMPK, but not DN-p38 MAPK, significantly reduced the insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin on Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B), which coincided with an increase in both basal and insulin-stimulated S6K phosphorylation and a decrease in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that adiponectin may sensitize insulin signaling by inhibiting S6K through an AMPK-dependent signaling pathway. One of the AMPK upstream kinases is LKB1, which phosphorylates AMPK on Thr172 in the activation loop (21Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2004-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). To determine whether adiponectin-stimulated AMPK activation is mediated by LKB1, we examined the effect of adiponectin on AMPK phosphorylation in HeLa cells, which express the adiponectin receptor AdipoR1 (data not shown) but not LKB1 (22Tiainen M. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9248-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We found that treatment of HeLa cells with the globular form of adiponectin led to a small but notable increase in insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, lane 4 versus 2) and Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 (Fig. 3B, lane 4 versus 2). Interestingly, the same anti-Akt antibody, which detected only a single band in C2C12 cells (Fig. 1), recognized two protein bands in the HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 3B, lower panel), which is consistent with the findings of others (23Faried L.S. Faried A. Kanuma T. Nakazato T. Tamura T. Kuwano H. Minegishi T. Eur. J. Cancer. 2006; 42: 934-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The slower migrating band corresponds to the phospho-Akt band as shown in the top panel (Fig. 3B), but the identity of the faster migrating band is currently unknown. The insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin was greatly enhanced in HeLa cells transiently expressing LKB1 (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 6 versus 4). Together, these results suggest that adiponectin may sensitize insulin signaling via pathways dependent and independent of LKB1, which is consistent with the findings that AMPK is activated by both LKB1 and the Ca2+-dependent kinase CaMKKβ (24Hardie D.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 2.1-2.26Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Unlike adiponectin, rapamycin enhanced insulin-induced Akt and IRS-1 phosphorylation in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D), which suggested that rapamycin increased insulin sensitivity via an mTOR/S6K-dependent but LKB1-independent mechanism. AMPK phosphorylates and activates TSC2 in response to cellular energy starvation (14Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). Activated TSC2 together with TSC1 negatively regulates the TOR complex 1 (TORC1) upstream activator, termed Rheb, leading to inhibition of mTOR/S6K (21Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2004-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). Consistent with results from others (25Radimerski T. Montagne J. Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Thomas G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was greatly inhibited in both TSC1–/– and TSC2–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (data not shown). Overexpression of Wt-TSC2 in C2C12 cells moderately increased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 (Fig. 4A, top panel, lane 2 versus 5). In contrast, overexpression of a mutant TSC2 in which the AMPK phosphorylation site Ser1345 was replaced with alanine (14Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar), markedly inhibited Akt phosphorylation induced by insulin or adiponectin plus insulin (Fig. 4, lanes 7–9). These results provide strong evidence for the involvement of the AMPK/TSC signaling pathway in the insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin. Activated TSC2 together with TSC1 serves as a GTPase-activating protein, which subsequently inhibits the activity of the Rheb, ultimately leading to inhibition of TORC1 (26Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). The effect of Rheb on TORC1 is specific, and Rheb does not activate TORC2 (27Yang Q. Inoki K. Kim E. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6811-6816Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates Akt at Ser473 (28Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5257) Google Scholar), the so-called PDK2 or hydrophobic motif site (29Dong L.Q. Liu F. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: E187-E196Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Overexpression of DN-Rheb mutant (D60K) inhibits not only the basal but also the nutrient- or serum-induced activity of p70S6K (30Tabancay Jr., A.P. Gau C.L. Machado I.M. Uhlmann E.J. Gutmann D.H. Guo L. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39921-39930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of wild-type Rheb leads to activation of mTOR and S6K (26Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Consistent with the observation that activation of S6K negatively regulates insulin action (9Haruta T. Uno T. Kawahara J. Takano A. Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. Kobayashi M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 10Ozes O.N. Akca H. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 35298-35305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), overexpression of DN-Rheb in C2C12 cells led to increased Akt phosphorylation in response to insulin and/or insulin plus adiponectin treatment, whereas overexpression of wild-type Rheb significantly inhibits the stimulatory effect of insulin and adiponectin (Fig. 5). These data suggest an involvement of Rheb in the cross-talk between adiponectin and insulin signaling pathways. To further elucidate the mechanism by which adiponectin enhances insulin sensitivity, we examined IRS-1 serine phosphorylation by Western blot using phosphospecific antibodies. Both adiponectin (Fig. 6A) and rapamycin (Fig. 6B) inhibited insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes. These results are consistent with previous findings that phosphorylation of Ser302 negatively regulates IRS-1 function (12Werner E.D. Lee J. Hansen L. Yuan M. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35298-35305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Gray A. Tolkacheva T. Wigfield S. Rebholz H. Barnett J. Leslie N.R. Cheng S. Shepherd P.R. Gout I. Downes C.P. Lamb R.F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), although controversial results exist on the roles of phosphorylation at this site (31Danielsson A. Ost A. Nystrom F.H. Stralfors P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34389-34392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Giraud J. Leshan R. Lee Y.H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3447-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition to Ser302, the insulin-induced Ser636/639 phosphorylation of IRS-1 was greatly inhibited by adiponectin or rapamycin (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively). This finding is interesting because phosphorylation of Ser636/639 of IRS-1 by mTOR/S6K has recently been shown to interrupt the interaction between IRS-1 and PI3K, leading to reduced PI3K activity and its mediated downstream events (33Tzatsos A. Kandror K.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). IRS-1 hyperphosphorylated at this site has also been observed in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetes subjects (34Bouzakri K. Roques M. Gual P. Espinosa S. Guebre-Egziabher F. Riou J.P. Laville M. March Le -Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Interestingly, adiponectin had little effect on insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser307 (Fig. 6A), a major c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation site (35Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that inhibition of S6K, not JNK, plays a major role in the insulin sensitizing effect of adiponectin. This result is consistent with a recent finding that activation of AMPK reduces IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and potentiates insulin action in C2C12 cells (36Ju J.S. Gitcho M.A. Casmaer C.A. Patil P.B. Han D.G. Spencer S.A. Fisher J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 292: C564-C572Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we describe a model of the cross-talk between the adiponectin and insulin signaling pathways (Fig. 7). In this model, adiponectin binds to its membrane receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, leading to recruitment of adaptor proteins such as APPL1 and activation of downstream kinases such as AMPK (16Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The activated AMPK is able to phosphorylate TSC2 on Ser1345 and activate it. Activated TSC2 together with TSC1 serves as a GTPase-activating protein, which inhibits the activity of the Rheb. Inhibition of Rheb reduces mTOR/S6K-mediated serine phosphorylation of IRS, leading to enhanced IRS tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2074749705,"The spiny ray-finned teleost fishes (Acanthomorpha) are the most successful group of vertebrates in terms of species diversity. Their meteoric radiation and speciation in the oceans during the late Cretaceous and Eocene epoch is unprecedented in vertebrate history, occurring in one third of the time for similar diversity to appear in the birds and mammals. The success of marine teleosts is even more remarkable considering their long freshwater ancestry, since it implies solving major physiological challenges when freely broadcasting their eggs in the hyper-osmotic conditions of seawater. Most extant marine teleosts spawn highly hydrated pelagic eggs, due to differential proteolysis of vitellogenin (Vtg)-derived yolk proteins. The maturational degradation of Vtg involves depolymerization of mainly the lipovitellin heavy chain (LvH) of one form of Vtg to generate a large pool of free amino acids (FAA 150-200 mM). This organic osmolyte pool drives hydration of the ooctye while still protected within the maternal ovary. In the present contribution, we have used Bayesian analysis to examine the evolution of vertebrate Vtg genes in relation to the ""3R hypothesis"" of whole genome duplication (WGD) and the functional end points of LvH degradation during oocyte maturation. We find that teleost Vtgs have experienced a post-R3 lineage-specific gene duplication to form paralogous clusters that correlate to the pelagic and benthic character of the eggs. Neo-functionalization allowed one paralogue to be proteolyzed to FAA driving hydration of the maturing oocytes, which pre-adapts them to the marine environment and causes them to float. The timing of these events matches the appearance of the Acanthomorpha in the fossil record. We discuss the significance of these adaptations in relation to ancestral physiological features, and propose that the neo-functionalization of duplicated Vtg genes was a key event in the evolution and success of the teleosts in the oceanic environment."
https://openalex.org/W1978006133,"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors. The anti-tumor activity of 5-FU has been attributed in part to its ability to induce p53-dependent cell growth arrest and apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying p53 activation by 5-FU remain largely obscure. Here we report that 5-FU treatment leads to p53 stabilization and activation by blocking MDM2 feedback inhibition through ribosomal proteins. 5-FU treatment increased the fraction of ribosome-free L5, L11, and L23 ribosomal proteins and their interaction with MDM2, leading to p53 activation and G<sub>1</sub>/S arrest. Conversely, individual knockdown of these ribosomal proteins by small interfering RNA prevented the 5-FU-induced p53 activation and reversed the 5-FU-induced G<sub>1</sub>/S arrest. These results demonstrate that 5-FU treatment triggers a ribosomal stress response so that ribosomal proteins L5, L11, and L23 are released from ribosome to activate p53 by ablating the MDM2-p53 feedback circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2079889142,"Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) has been mainly studied because of its glucose-dependent insulinotropic action and its ability to regulate β-cell proliferation and survival. Considerably less is known about the effects of GIP on fat metabolism, and the present study was directed at identifying the mechanisms underlying its stimulatory action on lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, GIP, in the presence of insulin, increased LPL activity and triglyceride accumulation through a pathway involving increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) and reductions in phosphorylated LKB1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Knockdown of AMPK using RNA interference and application of the AMPK inhibitor, Compound C, supported this conclusion. In contrast, the other major incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1, exhibited no significant effects on LPL activity or PKB, LKB1, or AMPK phosphorylation. Cultured subcutaneous human adipocytes showed similar responses to GIP but with greater sensitivity. Chronic elevation of circulating GIP levels in the Vancouver diabetic fatty Zucker rat in vivo resulted in increased LPL activity and elevated triglyceride accumulation in epidydimal fat tissue, combined with a modulation of PKB, LKB1, and AMPK phosphorylation similar to that observed in vitro.

Both incretins also exert powerful positive effects on pancreatic β-cell growth, development, and survival (5Ehses J.A. Casilla V.R. Doty T. Pospisilik J.A. Winter K.D. Demuth H.-U. Pederson R.A.

GIP is released in response to administration of triglycerides (TG) (1Brown J.C. Buchan A.M.J. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A. Schultz S.G. Makhlouf G.M. Rauner B.B. Handbook of Physiology.

In dogs, GIP has been shown to promote clearance of chylomicron-associated TG from blood (10Wasada T. McCorkle K. Harris V. Kawai K. Howard B. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1106-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and in rats, it has been shown to promote infusion of GIP-lowered plasma TG responses to intraduodenal fat (11Ohneda A. Kobayashi T. Nihei J. Regul. Pept. 1984; 8: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). GIP enhanced FA synthesis from acetate in adipose tissue explants (12Oben J. Morgan L. Fletcher J. Marks V. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 130: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) as well as potentiating insulin-stimulated FA incorporation into adipose tissue (13Beck B. Max J.P. Regul.

Nutr. 1995; 125: 183-188PubMed Google Scholar). These studies pointed to a significant role for GIP in the regulation of adipogenesis, and its physiological importance was emphasized by the demonstration by Miyawaki et al. (16Miyawaki K. Yamada Y.

The GIP receptor is a member of the class B seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled family to which the receptors for glucagon, GLP-1, and secretin belong (17Wheeler M.B. Gelling R.W. McIntosh C.H.S.

The majority of studies on the mode of action of GIP have been performed in islets, dissociated β-cells, or β-cell lines, and these have shown that receptor activation results in the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (17Wheeler M.B.

GIP receptor expression has been demonstrated in rat adipocytes (23Yip R.G.C. Boylan M.O. Kieffer T.J. Wolfe M.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4004-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (8McIntosh C.H.S. Bremsak I. Lynn F.C. Gill R. Hinke S.A. Gelling R. McKnight G. Jaspers S. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and, in the absence of insulin, activation results in the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and lipolysis (8McIntosh C.H.S.

However, since this lipolytic action is inhibited by insulin (8McIntosh C.H.S. Bremsak I. Lynn F.C. Gill R. Hinke S.A. Gelling R. McKnight G. Jaspers S. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it was considered likely that the lipogenic effects of GIP are mediated through alternative pathways. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that acts as an intracellular energy sensor (24Carling D. Trends Biochem.

AMPK exists as a heterotrimeric protein complex consisting of a catalytic subunit (α) and two regulatory subunits (β and γ) (24Carling D. Trends Biochem.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In keeping with its energy sensor role, starvation activates AMPK in adipose tissue (28Sponarova J. Mustard K.J. Horakova O.

The overall effect of AMPK is to convert adipocytes into lipid oxidizing cells with suppressed lipolysis and lipogenesis (29Daval M. Foufelle F. Ferré P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 574: 55-62Crossref Scopus (311) Google Scholar). LPL catalyzes the hydrolysis of TG associated with chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins in the circulation, thus generating 2-monoacylglycerol and fatty acids, that undergo re-esterification in adipocytes (31Preiss-Landl K. Zimmermann R. Hämmerle G. Zechner R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 471-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 32Goldberg I.J. J.

The regulation of LPL expression and action is complex and involves transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translocation events (31Preiss-Landl K. Zimmermann R. Hämmerle G. Zechner R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 471-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 32Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Braun J.E. Severson D.L.

Food deprivation results in down-regulation of adipose tissue LPL, whereas insulin increases overall activity, possibly by acting at several levels (31Preiss-Landl K. Zimmermann R. Hämmerle G.

Diabetes. 1979; 28: 1141-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 15Knapper J.M.E. Puddicombe S.M. Morgan L.M. Fletcher J.M. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 183-188PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that it might act by suppressing AMPK levels, thus promoting fatty acid and 2-monoacylglycerol delivery to the cell and contributing to increased adipogenesis (6Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5145-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 7Morgan L.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Beck B. Max J.P. Regul. Pept. 1983; 7: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using differentiated 3T3-L1 cells and human subcutaneous adipocytes, we have demonstrated that GIP increases phosphorylation of PKB and decreases LKB1 and AMPK phosphorylation in the presence of insulin, resulting in activation of LPL and TG accumulation. Knockdown of AMPK using RNA interference and application of the AMPK inhibitor Compound C supported this conclusion. Chronic elevation of circulating GIP levels in the Vancouver diabetic fatty (VDF) Zucker rat in vivo resulted in activation of LPL in epidydimal fat tissue by a similar pathway. This appears to be the first description of a signaling pathway by which GIP stimulates FA storage in adipocytes. Cell Culture and Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes— 3T3-L1 cells (American Type Culture Collection; ATCC) were cultured in DMEM containing high glucose and supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum plus penicillin/streptomycin (standard medium) in 6-well culture plates. Cells were induced to differentiate into the adipocyte phenotype as previously described (8McIntosh C.H.S. Bremsak I. Lynn F.C. Gill R. Hinke S.A. Gelling R. McKnight G. Jaspers S. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 days after cells were confluent, medium was supplemented with dexamethasone (0.6 μm), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.1 mm), and insulin (16 μm) for 72 h, after which cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Differentiation was complete in 7 days. Differentiated cells were confirmed by Oil Red O staining, and fully differentiated cells (>85% adipose cells) from passages 3–8 were used in all experiments. Cell Culture and Differentiation of Human Adipocytes—Subcutaneous human preadipocytes were from Zen-Bio Inc. (Research Triangle Park, NC). They were obtained from healthy, nondiabetic women (n = 7; average body mass index, 25.17 kg/m2 (range 22.5–28.2); average age, 41 years (range 27–51)) and differentiated into adipocytes according to the supplier's protocol. Institutional review board approval and informed consent for use of the adipose tissue were obtained from the patients by Zen-Bio Inc. Western Blot Analysis—For studies on the effect of GIP on PKB, LKB1, and AMPK phosphorylation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes or human adipocytes were incubated with GIP in the presence of 1 nm insulin, as indicated in the figure legends. Where appropriate, the AMPK inhibitor, Compound C (6-[4-(2-piperidin-1-yl-ethoxy)-phenyl)]-3-pyridin-4-yl-pyrrazolo[1,5-a]-pyrimidine) (Calbiochem), was added at a final concentration of 40 μm. Total cellular extracts from each sample were separated on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Probing of the membranes was performed with phospho-PKB (serine 473), PKB, phospho-LKB1 (serine 428), phospho-AMPK (threonine 172), AMPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and β-tubulin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (50 IU/ml, 50 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and transfected with constitutively active AMPK (CA-AMPK) and dominant negative AMPK (DN-AMPK) cDNAs, expressing the constitutively active and dominant negative forms of AMPK, respectively. For CA-AMPK, the cDNA encoded residues 1–312 of AMPK subunit α1, containing a mutation resulting in a change of threonine 172 to aspartic acid. A cDNA encoding subunit α1 containing a mutation altering an aspartic acid residue 157 to alanine was used. CA- and DN-AMPK constructs were kindly provided by Dr. David Carling (Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000™ transfection reagent (Invitrogen) for 4 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were selected with G418 (Invitrogen), and cell clones were combined, differentiated into adipocytes, and analyzed by Western blotting to confirm AMPK protein expression levels. Knockdown of AMPKα by RNA Interference—To reduce levels of endogenous AMPKα, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with a pool of three siRNAs for AMPKα (sc-45313; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine 2000™ transfection reagent and incubated for 72 h. The specific interference of AMPK protein expression was confirmed by Western blot hybridization using antibody against phospho-AMPK, phospho-LKB1, and phospho-PKB. LPL Enzyme Activity Assays—The LPL activity assay kit (Roar Biomedical Inc.) was used to measure enzyme activity, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Enzyme activity is presented as relative activity normalized to protein concentration. GIP Infusion—Obese VDF rats and their lean littermate controls (12 weeks old) were subjected to a 2-week continuous infusion of GIP (10 pmol/kg·min). The infusion was performed using an Alzet miniosmotic pump (Alzet Corp., Minneapolis, MN) implanted in the intraperitoneal region under pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) anesthesia. Rats were sacrificed at the end of the infusion, and epidydimal fat tissues were harvested for Western blotting. Experiments were conducted in accordance with guidelines of the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee and Canadian Council on Animal Care. Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests (OGTTs) and Measurements of Blood Glucose and Plasma Insulin Levels—Blood glucose levels were measured using a SureStep Glucose analyzer (LifeScan Canada, Burnaby, Canada). Following an approximate 16-h overnight fast, OGTTs (2 g/kg) were performed, with blood glucose levels following the glucose challenge measured at the time points indicated in Fig. 8E. Plasma insulin levels were determined using a radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO). Oil Red O Staining—After overnight serum starvation, human adipocytes were treated for 24 h with GIP (100 nm) or GLP-1 (100 nm) in the presence of insulin (1 nm). Cells were then fixed and stained for 2 h by complete immersion in a working solution of Oil Red O. The method of Ramirez-Zacarias et al. (36Ramirez-Zacarias J.L. Castro-Mufiozledo F. Kuri-Harcuch W. Histochemistry. 1992; 97: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) was used to determine the level of staining. Isopropyl alcohol was added to the stained culture dish and dye-extracted by gentle pipetting, and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured spectrophotometically. Determination of Intracellular TG Content—A TG assay kit (Zen-Bio Inc.) was used to measure intracellular TG content of human adipocytes and epididymal fat tissues, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. with the number of individual experiments presented in the figure legend. Data were analyzed using the nonlinear regression analysis program PRISM (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), and significance was tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Newman-Keuls post hoc test (p < 0.05) as indicated in the figure legends. GIP, but Not GLP-1, Strongly Increases LPL Activity in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—The effect of the incretins, GIP and GLP-1, on LPL activity was first studied in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment with GIP (100 nm) in the presence of insulin (1 nm) for 24 h resulted in ∼2.6-fold increases in LPL activity, compared with basal. In contrast, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with GLP-1 (100 nm) under identical conditions resulted in only small increases in mean LPL activity that did not reach significance (Fig. 1A). Concentration-dependent effects of GIP on LPL activity were observed with EC50 values of 15.3 ± 0.1 nm (Fig. 1B). GIP Treatment of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Results in Increased PKB Phosphorylation and Decreased Phosphorylation of AMPK and LKB1—The mechanisms involved in the activation of LPL by GIP treatment were next studied. Phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 by upstream kinase AMPK kinases is essential for its activation (24Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 25Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Scott J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 574: 7-15Crossref Scopus (651) Google Scholar), resulting in increases in activity of at least 50-fold. The major upstream kinase for activation of AMPK in most tissues, including adipose (25Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Scott J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 574: 7-15Crossref Scopus (651) Google Scholar), has recently been identified as LKB1 (37Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U.

Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with GIP (100 nm) in the presence of insulin (1 nm) resulted in profound decreases in phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 (Fig. 2A) and LKB1 at Ser428 (Fig. 2C). GIP-induced responses were concentration-dependent, with EC50 values of 34.7 ± 0.2 nm for AMPK (Fig. 2B) and 25.5 ± 0.2 nm for LKB1 (Fig. 2D). In parallel experiments, GIP stimulated phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 (Fig. 2E) with an EC50 of 35.6 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 2F). Decreased phosphorylation of both AMPK and LKB1 (Fig. 2, A and C) and increased phosphorylation of PKB (Fig. 2E) were evident by 6 h following GIP treatment and sustained for 24 h. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with GLP-1 (100 nm) in the presence of 1 nm insulin resulted in no significant changes in phosphorylation of PKB, LKB1, or AMPK (Fig. 3). These results correlated well with the lack of effect of GLP-1 on LPL (Fig. 1).FIGURE 3GLP-1 had no significant effects on phosphorylation of AMPK, LKB1, or PKB in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Protocols for treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with GIP were as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Shown is the time course of phosphorylation of AMPK (A), LKB1 (C), and PKB (E) in the presence of GIP. Shown are concentration-response effects of GIP on AMPK (B), LKB1 (D), and PKB (F). Western blots were quantified using densitometric analysis and are representative of n = 3. Significance was tested using ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post hoc test. **, p < 0.05 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PI3K Is Involved in GIP Regulation of the PKB/LKB1/AMPK/LPL Signaling Pathway—Since phosphorylation of both Thr308 and Ser473 by PI3K is essential for PKB activation (39Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 5: 6541-6551Crossref Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), the relationship between PI3K and the PKB/LKB1/AMPK signaling modules was next studied using the selective pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K, LY294002 and wortmannin. Inhibition of PI3K greatly reduced basal levels of phospho-PKB and ablated PKB responses to GIP (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, inhibition of PI3K slightly increased basal levels of both phosphorylated LKB1 and AMPK, and GIP treatment had no significant effect on levels of either phosphorylated kinase (Fig. 4, B and C). Under the same conditions of PI3K inhibition, basal LPL activity was decreased, and responses to GIP were severely attenuated (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that PI3K is an upstream component of the GIP-stimulated PKB/AMPK/LPL signaling pathways. PKB and LKB1 Act Upstream of AMPK and LPL—To define further the relationship between PKB/LKB1 and AMPK signaling modules in the regulation of LPL activity, 3T3-L1 adipocytes stably expressing CA or DN forms of AMPK were generated. 3T3-L1 adipocytes stably expressing CA-AMPK demonstrated increased basal phospho-AMPK levels that were reduced by treatment with GIP or high concentrations of insulin (100 nm) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, levels of phospho-AMPK were greatly reduced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing DN-AMPK (Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, the residual phospho-AMPK was ablated by GIP or insulin (100 nm). There were no significant changes in the phosphorylation levels of PKB and LKB1 with the expression of CA- or DN-AMPK, when compared with 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfected with empty vector (Fig. 5, B and C). In parallel experiments, 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing CA-AMPK had decreased basal LPL that was still responsive to GIP stimulation. Expression of DN-AMPK increased basal LPL activity, and GIP treatment resulted in a further increase (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that PKB/LKB1 is an upstream signaling module of AMPK. However, since LPL activity of CA- and DN-AMPK cells was still responsive to GIP, alternative approaches were applied to establish that phospho-AMPK was involved in GIP-mediated LPL activation. First, pretreatment of cells with an AMPK inhibitor, Compound C, resulted in a marked decrease in phospho-AMPK levels (Fig. 6A) without changes in phosphorylation levels of PKB and LKB1 (Fig. 6, B and C). Phospho-AMPK levels were too low to assess effects of GIP. Under the same conditions, AMPK inhibitor increased LPL activity, but it was not further increased by GIP treatment (Fig. 6D). RNA interference-mediated knockdown of AMPKα resulted in similar results: a substantial decre"

Specific and potent GSK3 inhibitors also alleviate the toxic effects of high concentrations of glucose and the saturated fatty acid palmitate on INS-1E cells. Furthermore, treatment of isolated rat islets with structurally diverse small molecule GSK3 inhibitors increases the rate beta cell replication by 2–3-fold relative to controls.

Diabetes results from an inadequate supply of the body with insulin. In type 1 diabetes, beta cells are destroyed by an autoimmune attack (1Gianani R. Eisenbarth G.S. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 204: 232-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas type 2 diabetes develops from a combination of peripheral insulin resistance and beta cell failure (2Donath M.Y. Ehses J.A. Maedler K. Schumann D.M. Ellingsgaard H. Eppler E. Reinecke M. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 3Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). Despite remarkable improvements in the management of diabetic patients over the last decades, new therapies are still needed to further improve metabolic control and thereby reduce the development of diabetic complications that are associated with significant rates of morbidity and mortality (4DCCT N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (22617) Google Scholar, 5Steffes M.W. Sibley S. Jackson M. Thomas W.

One of the most promising concepts for the treatment of diabetes is the development of therapies for the preservation and regeneration of beta cell mass and function. Ongoing formation of new beta cells in patients with type 1 diabetes has been described even in patients with long disease history. This suggests that beta cell regenerative treatments could be successful even in patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes, provided the autoimmune destruction of beta cells can be controlled (7Atkinson M.A. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Meier J.J. Bhushan A. Butler A.E. Rizza R.A. Butler P.C. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Individuals with type 2 diabetes could also benefit from agents that preserve or expand beta cell mass, since several studies have demonstrated that the beta cell mass is significantly reduced in these patients (9Butler A.E.

Beta cell mass in humans and rodents is dynamically regulated in response to changes in insulin requirements (15Bernard-Kargar C. Ktorza A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 30-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of recent reports have demonstrated using rodent models of diabetes that pancreatic beta cell mass is responsive to pharmacologically active agents promoting beta cell expansion and/or protection. Several proteins exhibit beta cell regenerative activities in rodent models of diabetes, with long acting analogs of the incretin hormone GLP-1 being among the most promising candidates (16Arulmozhi D.K. Portha B. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2006; 28: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Baggio L.L. Drucker D.J. Annu. Rev.

On the contrary, effective small molecule agents or chemically tractable candidate drug targets for systematic development of small molecule therapeutics are scarce. Studies with growth factors and genetic approaches have established the significance of certain intracellular pathways, including insulin signaling, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling, and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling for the regulation of beta cell mass (21Vasavada R.C. Gonzalez-Pertusa J.A. Fujinaka Y. Fiaschi-Taesch N. Cozar-Castellano I. Garcia-Ocana A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 931-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We have studied the role of the serine/threonine kinase GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) in beta cells. GSK3 is a well described element of the insulin signaling pathway. However, the precise role of GSK3 for beta cell growth and survival is incompletely understood. Two highly homologous GSK3 isoforms, α and β, are widely expressed (22Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 23Woodgett J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 564-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). GSK3 is a constitutively active enzyme and is inactivated by inhibitory phosphorylation in response to insulin, Wnt, or other growth factor signaling (24Cohen P. Goedert M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 25Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 26Meijer L. Flajolet M. Greengard P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In insulin signaling, GSK3 is inactivated by the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which in turn is regulated by phosphoinositide (PI) 3The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphoinositide; GIP, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; siRNA, small interfering RNA; BIO, 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime.3The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphoinositide; GIP, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; siRNA, small interfering RNA; BIO, 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime. 3-kinase. PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling is crucial for glucose sensing and beta cell growth (27Jetton T.L. Lausier J. LaRock K. Trotman W.E. Larmie B. Habibovic A. Peshavaria M. Leahy J.L.

Physiol. 2004; 286: E41-E49Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For instance, the overexpression of Akt in beta cells markedly increases beta cell mass (30Bernal-Mizrachi E. Wen W. Stahlhut S. Welling C.M. Permutt M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1631-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 31Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J.P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S. Naji A. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been reported that pancreatic beta cells can be protected from endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced death by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of GSK3 (32Srinivasan S. Ohsugi M. Liu Z. Fatrai S. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, inactivation of GSK3 occurs in response to a number of known beta cell mitogens, such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), GLP-1, and insulin-like growth factor-1, mediated by the upstream PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (33Buteau J. Foisy S. Joly E. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 34Buteau J. Roduit R. Susini S. Prentki M.

Based on these observations, GSK3 beta has been proposed to be a possible target for beta cell protective agents (32Srinivasan S. Ohsugi M. Liu Z. Fatrai S. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 38Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44701-44708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was reported that active GSK3 negatively affects beta cell function by modulating the stability and subcellular localization of the beta cell differentiation factor Pdx1 (40Boucher M.J. Selander L. Carlsson L. Edlund H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6395-6403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In diabetes, beta cell loss and dysfunction are most likely resulting from synergistic effects of different factors negatively affecting beta cells for prolonged periods of time. For instance, chronic or recurrent exposure of beta cells to elevated levels of glucose and lipids (glucolipotoxicity) or to proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, and interferon-γ, interferes with beta cell function and contributes to their destruction (2Donath M.Y. Ehses J.A. Maedler K. Schumann D.M. Ellingsgaard H. Eppler E. Reinecke M. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 41Prentki M. Nolan C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1802-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Using potent and specific small molecule GSK3 inhibitors, we found that the inactivation of GSK3 protects beta cells against death induced by high concentrations of glucose and the saturated fatty acid palmitate. In addition, small molecule GSK3 inhibitors robustly stimulate beta cell proliferation. These results suggest that GSK3 plays a key role in the regulation of beta cell mass and is a target for beta cell regenerative therapies. Cell Culture—INS-1E cells were maintained in culture medium (RPMI 1640 containing 11 mm glucose, 5% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate) and cultivated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere as described (42Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), except as otherwise stated. Cells were seeded into tissue culture flasks at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 6–8 days before treatment. During the growth period, the medium was changed twice. Isolation of Rat Islets—Islets were isolated by the standard Liberase digestion method from rat pancreata (Liberase™ CI enzyme blend BMB, catalog number 1814-435; Roche Applied Science) and cultured as described (43Brun T. Franklin I. St-Onge L. Biason-Lauber A. Schoenle E.J. Wollheim C.B. Gauthier B.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 ml of ice-cold Liberase solution (Roche Applied Science) was injected into the pancreas via the common bile duct. After dissection, the pancreas was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C and then further dissociated by repeated pipetting using a 10-ml pipette. Islets were purified by a Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and were manually picked using a stereomicroscope. Islets were placed in bacteriological wells, and factors were administered as indicated. For quantitative reverse-phase PCR, islets were harvested in Trizol™ and immediately transferred to dry ice. RNA was isolated according to common procedures. Viability Assay, Cell Number Determination, Caspase Activity Assay, and DNA Fragmentation Assay—INS-1E cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/96-well plate (black 96-well tissue culture plates; Falcon catalog number 353948) and grown in 100 μl of culture medium/well supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 3 days. The metabolic activity or viability of INS-1E cells was assessed by mitochondric reduction of the nontoxic dye Alamar Blue (Biosource catalog number DAL1025). The dye was added to the cells 4 h before read-out according to the manufacturer's guidelines. For the determination of relative cell numbers, INS-1E cells were maintained for 24 h in 100 μl of starvation medium (culture medium with only 5 mm glucose, 1% fetal calf serum) before the test compounds were added for an additional 4 days. Then the tissue culture plates were washed one time with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and frozen at -80 °C for at least 1 h. Cell number was measured by staining of cellular DNA with CyQuant dye (CyQuant cell proliferation assay kit; Molecular Probes, Inc., catalog number C-7026), which becomes fluorescent when bound to DNA. Fluorescence was measured after 30 min of incubation using the FLUOstar Optima reader from BMG Labtechnologies. Glucolipotoxicity-mediated apoptosis was induced by the addition of a combination of bovine serum albumin-coupled palmitate (0.3 mm palmitate, bovine serum albumin (palmitic acid sodium salt/fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 6:1)) and glucose (25 mm) to the starvation medium followed by a 24-h incubation period. Test compounds were added 1 h prior to the addition of apoptosis-inducing factors. Caspase activity was quantified by an enzymatic assay (homogeneous caspase assay; Roche Applied Science catalog number 03 005 372 001). Caspase activity was measured 3 h after the addition of caspase substrate according to the guidelines of the manufacturer. The frequency of apoptosis was also monitored by the determination of mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates using the cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science catalog number 1774425). The assay is based on a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay principle using mouse monoclonal anti-histone and anti-DNA peroxidase antibodies. The relative frequency of apoptosis was photometrically determined by measuring the peroxidase activity of the immunocomplexes at 405 nm. Fluorescence or photometric measurements were carried out with the FLUOstar Optima reader from BMG Labtechnologies. In Vitro Beta Cell Proliferation Assay—Freshly isolated islets were cultured in vitro with or without the addition of factors of interest for 48 or 72 h. Following the culture period, the islets were dispersed gently by titration in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. The resulting single cell suspension was applied to adhesive slides at 3000–6000 cells/well (adhesion slides/Fa Superior Marienfeld REF 09 000 00). The adherent islet cells were fixed and stained by standard immunofluorescence techniques for C-peptide, a fragment of proinsulin, and Ki-67 a marker of proliferating cells. Nuclear DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). An Olympus microscope equipped with an automatic image acquisition device (Olympus) was used for counting of C-peptide-positive beta cells. Proliferating C-peptide/Ki-67 double positive beta cells were counted manually. The fraction of proliferating beta corresponds to the percentage of Ki-67 double positive cells of all C-peptide-positive cells. Using this assay, the growth-promoting effects of a number of known beta cell mitogens, including prolactin, GIP, hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, growth hormone, exendin-4, betacellulin, fibroblast growth factor-2, and activin on rat beta cells were detectable (data not shown). Data generated with prolactin and GIP are presented in Fig. 4. BrdUrd Labeling and Detection Assay—INS-1E cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates and cultured as described above for the caspase activity assay. BrdUrd labeling and detection was carried out with a commercially available kit (cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, BrdUrd (chemiluminescence) Roche Applied Science catalog number 1 669 915) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 24 h after switching to starvation medium, test compounds were added, and cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. BrdUrd labeling solution was added to the medium for the last 4 h before the cells were fixed using FixDenat solution and incubated with monoclonal anti-BrdUrd-POD antibodies. After substrate solution was added to each well, the light emission was measured in a microplate luminometer using the Analyst™ HT detection system from LJL Biosystems Inc. RNA Interference, Western Blotting, and Proliferation Assay— For Western blotting, INS-1E cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and cultured overnight before transfection. Cells were transfected with 6 μl of HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) and mixed with 5 nm siRNA duplexes (Qiagen). For quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, cells were harvested in Qiagen lysis buffer 72 or 140 h after transfection. For Western blot analysis, cells were harvested in a standard protein lysis buffer. Total protein was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were developed using the chemiluminescence detection system SuperSignal West Dura from Pierce (product number 34075). The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-GSK3α and -β (Calbiochem catalog number 368662) at a 1:1000 dilution, mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma catalog number T6557) at a 1:10,000 dilution, and as a secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce product number 34075) at a 1:5000 dilution. For the determination of the proliferation rate of INS-1E, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and cultured overnight before transfection. Following, cells were transfected with 0.7 μl of HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) mixed with 5 nm siRNA duplexes. After 24 h, incubation medium was replaced by starvation medium. 48 h later, BrdUrd labeling solution (Roche Applied Science) was added to the medium for 4 h, and the rate of proliferating cells was then determined as described above using the cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). The following siRNA duplexes were purchased from Qiagen: rat GSK3β, sense (r(CGAUUACACGUCUAGUAUA)dTdT) and antisense (r(UAUACUAGACGUGUAAUCG)dGdT); rat GSK3α, sense (r(GGGUGUAAAUAGAUUGUUA)dTdT) and antisense (r(UAACAAUCUAUUUACACCC)dAdA); control nonsilencing siRNA, sense (UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT) and antisense (ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA(dTdT)). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from 8 × 104 INS-1E cells growing on 4-cm2 surface area of a tissue culture dish was extracted using Qiagen RNAeasy kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen), and 2 μg was converted into cDNA. Primers for the analyzed genes were designed using the Primer Express 1.5 Software from Applied Biosystems, and sequences are available upon request. Quantitative real time PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems SDS 7000 detection system. Amplifications for a gene were performed in duplicate, and mean values were normalized to the mean value of the reference RNA, 18 S RNA. Mean gene expression values in cycle thresholds ± S.D. were determined from three wells of untreated rat islets kept for 24 h in culture medium (see Fig. 4E). The values for the indicated genes are as follows: bcl-xL, 23.6 ± 0.3; c-myc, 26.6 ± 0.4; id2, 22.7 ± 0.3; pax4, 32.2 ± 0.28; CDK4, 22.3 ± 0.2; neuroD, 19.35 ± 0.3; pdx1, 23.3 ± 0.2; cypB, 22.7 ± 0.3. A corresponding analysis was carried out with untreated INS-1E (see Fig. 3A). Mean cycle thresholds ± S.D. for GSK3α or -β and cyclophilin B were 21.5 ± 0.09, 25 ± 0.12, and 21.5 ± 0.1, respectively. GSK3 Inhibitors—The Chiron inhibitor CT99021 (6-{2-[4-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-pyrimidin-2-ylamino]ethyl-amino}nicotinonitrile) was synthesized by Asinex Inc. for DeveloGen AG. The compound was >98% pure by NMR and analytical high pressure liquid chromatography. All other GSK3 inhibitors used in this study were obtained from Calbiochem. Small Molecule Inhibitors of GSK3 Alleviate Glucolipotoxicity in INS-1E Beta Cells—INS-1E, a rat insulinoma cell line (42Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), shares many features with primary beta cells and is therefore widely used in the field to study beta cell function. We have studied the effects of well known and specific small molecule inhibitors of GSK3 on INS-1E cells exposed to toxic concentrations of glucose and the unsaturated fatty acid palmitate. INS-1E cells were treated for 24 h with a combination of high glucose (25 mm) and high palmitate (0.3 mm) concentrations. High glucose/high palmitate treatment was shown previously to induce cell death in INS-1-derived cell lines (44El-Assaad W. Buteau J. Peyot M.L. Nolan C. Roduit R. Hardy S. Joly E. Dbaibo G.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3905-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In fact, microscopic examination of INS-1E cells exposed to the mixture revealed typical features of apoptotic cells, such as condensed nuclei and membrane blebbing (data not shown). In order to quantitatively evaluate these apoptotic processes in the presence or absence of GSK3 inhibitors, two biological assays were established, enabling us to determine DNA fragmentation in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, B, E, and H) and the enzymatic activity of caspases in cell lysates (Fig. 1, C, F, and I). Low levels of these apoptotic processes were detectable in untreated INS-1E cells (Fig. 1, Co.). The treatment with a combination of high glucose and palmitate stimulated these processes severalfold, confirming microscopic observations. For our studies, three structurally diverse, small molecule kinase inhibitors were selected: CHIR99021 (47Cline G.W. Johnson K. Regittnig W. Perret P. Tozzo E. Xiao L. Damico C. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime (BIO) (48Meijer L. Skaltsounis A.L. Magiatis P. Polychronopoulos P. Knockaert M. Leost M.

Lett. 2004; 14: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), since they are cell-permeable and among the most potent and selective GSK3 inhibitors currently available. In particular, CHIR99021 has been considered an early clinical candidate and has previously been used to study the potential of GSK3 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (50Wagman A.S. Johnson K.W. Bussiere D.E. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1105-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and hematopoietic stem cell repopulation (51Trowbridge J.J. Xenocostas A. Moon R.T. Bhatia M. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) in the respective animal disease models. Treatment of INS-1E cells with 1-azakenpaullone or CHIR99021 alone did not compromise the viability of INS-1E cells even at high compound concentrations (Fig. 1, A and D, respectively). On the contrary, the GSK3 inhibitor BIO significantly reduced INS-1E viability at concentrations above 2 μm (Fig. 1G). In order to avoid potential off target effects, BIO was therefore used in the following studies at concentrations below 2 μm. Interestingly, all three GSK3 inhibitors counteract cell death induced by high glucose and high palmitate in INS-E cells in a concentration-dependent manner as demonstrated by reduced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1, B, E, and H) and caspase activity (Fig. 1, C, F, and I), indicating a GSK3-mediated mechanism. On the other hand, GSK3 inhibitors did not completely abolish apoptotic processes, pointing at the involvement of GSK3-independent signaling events. Taken together, these results are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that inactivation of GSK3β protects beta cells against endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis (32Srinivasan S. Ohsugi M. Liu Z. Fatrai S. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 46Wang H. Kouri G. Wollheim C.B. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3905-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Inhibition of GSK3 Activity Stimulates Growth of INS-1E Beta Cells—As previously reported by others, a functional PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway is instrumental for the regulation of beta cell mass. To study the role of the AKT target GSK3 in beta cell replication, INS-1E cells were incubated with the above described potent and specific GSK3 inhibitors. The treatment with any of the three GSK3 inhibitors increased the rate of proliferation of INS-1E cells in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 2, A, C, and E). The rate of proliferation reached a maximum in the presence of 2.5–10 μm CHIR99021 and 1-azakenpaullone, whereas BIO maximally stimulated proliferation between 0.5 and 1 μm. Above 1 μm, the proproliferative effects of BIO gradually disappeared, probably due to the off target effects already observed in Fig. 1G. GSK3 inhibitors promote survival and replication of INS-1E cells, implying that GSK3 inhibitor treatment may support net growth of INS-1E cells. In fact, INS-1E cell cultures treated with GSK3 inhibitors grew faster than vehicle-treated INS-E cell cultures, since cultures subjected for 4 days to GSK3 inhibitors contained more cells (Fig. 2, B, D, and F). Thus, GSK3 inhibitors appear to mimic growth factors and may be capable of stimulating the expansion of beta cell mass in vivo. In the course of the study, we also investigated the effects of other known small molecule GSK3 inhibitors on beta cell function (Table 1). Lithium chloride (LiCl) has been used in numerous studies to inactivate GSK3 (52Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2049578944,"Sperm design varies enormously across species and sperm competition is thought to be a major factor influencing this variation. However, the functional significance of many sperm traits is still poorly understood. The sperm of most murid rodents are characterised by an apical hook of the sperm head that varies markedly in extent across species. In the European woodmouse Apodemus sylvaticus (Muridae), the highly reflected apical hook of sperm is used to form sperm groups, or ""trains,"" which exhibited increased swimming velocity and thrusting force compared to individual sperm.Here we use a comparative study of murine rodent sperm and demonstrate that the apical hook and sperm cooperation are likely to be general adaptations to sperm competition in rodents. We found that species with relatively larger testes, and therefore more intense sperm competition, have a longer, more reflected apical sperm hook. In addition, we show that sperm groups also occur in rodents other than the European woodmouse.Our results suggest that in rodents sperm cooperation is more widespread than assumed so far and highlight the importance of diploid versus haploid selection in the evolution of sperm design and function."
https://openalex.org/W2155779464,"Nna1 is a recently described gene product that has sequence similarity with metallocarboxypeptidases. In the present study, five additional Nna1-like genes were identified in the mouse genome and named cytosolic carboxypeptidase (CCP) 2 through 6. Modeling suggests that the carboxypeptidase domain folds into a structure that resembles metallocarboxypeptidases of the M14 family, with all necessary residues for catalytic activity and broad substrate specificity. All CCPs are abundant in testis and also expressed in brain, pituitary, eye, and other mouse tissues. In brain, Nna1/CCP1, CCP5, and CCP6 are broadly distributed, whereas CCP2 and 3 exhibit restricted patterns of expression. Nna1/CCP1, CCP2, CCP5, and CCP6 were found to exhibit a cytosolic distribution, with a slight accumulation of CCP5 in the nucleus. Based on the above results, we hypothesized that Nna1/CCP1 and CCP2-6 function in the processing of cytosolic proteins such as alpha-tubulin, which is known to be modified by the removal of a C-terminal tyrosine. Analysis of the forms of alpha tubulin in the olfactory bulb of mice lacking Nna1/CCP1 showed the absence of the detyrosinylated form in the mitral cells. Taken together, these results are consistent with a role for Nna1/CCP1 and the related CCPs in the processing of tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W2069798170,"Background The brain is deemed “immunologically privileged” due to sparse professional antigen-presenting cells and lymphatic drainage, and to the blood-brain barrier. Although the actual extent of this privilege is controversial, there is general consensus about the limited need in intracerebral neural grafts for immunosuppressive regimens comparable to those used in other cases of allotransplantation. This has led over the past fifteen years to the use of either short-term or even no immunosuppression in most clinical trials with foetal neural transplant in patients with Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. Methodology/Principal Findings We report biological demonstration of alloimmunisation without signs of rejection in four grafted patients out of 13 studied during the course of a clinical trial involving fetal neural transplantation in patients with Huntington's Disease. Biological, radiological and clinical demonstration of an ongoing rejection process was observed in a fifth transplanted patient. The rejection process was, however, fully reversible under immunosuppressive treatment and graft activity recovered within six months. Conclusions/Significance There had been, up to date, no report of documented cases that could have cast a doubt on those procedures. Our results underline the need for a reconsideration of the extent of the so-called immune privilege of the brain and of the follow-up protocols of patients with intracerebral grafts. It also suggests that some of the results obtained in past studies with foetal neural transplants may have been biased by an unrecognized immune response to donor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2115123775,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-D is a secreted glycoprotein that induces angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. It consists of a central domain, containing binding sites for VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and VEGFR-3, and N- and C-terminal propeptides. It is secreted from the cell as homodimers of the full-length form that can be proteolytically processed to remove the propeptides. It was recently shown, using adenoviral gene delivery, that fully processed VEGF-D induces angiogenesis in vivo, whereas full-length VEGF-D does not. To better understand these observations, we monitored the effect of VEGF-D processing on receptor binding using a full-length VEGF-D mutant that cannot be processed. This mutant binds VEGFR-2, the receptor signaling for angiogenesis, with approximately 17,000-fold lower affinity than mature VEGF-D, indicating the importance of processing for interaction with this receptor. Further, we show that members of the proprotein convertase (PC) family of proteases promote VEGF-D processing, which facilitates the VEGF-D/VEGFR-2 interaction. The PCs furin and PC5 promote cleavage of both propeptides, whereas PC7 promotes cleavage of the C-terminal propeptide only. The finding that PCs promote activation of VEGF-D and other proteins with roles in cancer such as matrix metalloproteinases, emphasizes the importance of these enzymes as potential regulators of tumor progression and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2122366541,"The product of phospholipase D (PLD) enzymatic action in cell membranes, phosphatidic acid (PA), regulates kinases implicated in NADPH oxidase activation, as well as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. However, other protein targets for this lipid second messenger must exist in order to explain other key PA-mediated cellular functions. In this study, PA was found to specifically and saturably bind to and activate recombinant and immunoprecipitated endogenous ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) with a stoichiometry of 94:1 lipid/protein. Polyphosphoinositides PI4-P and PI4,5P2 and cardiolipin could also bind to and activate S6K, albeit with different kinetics. Conversely, PA with at least one acyl side chain saturated (10:0) was ineffective in binding or activating the enzyme. Transfection of COS-7 cells with a wild-type myc-(pcDNA)-PLD2 construct resulted in high PLD activity, concomitantly with an increase in ribosomal p70S6K enzyme activity and phosphorylation in T389 and T421/S424 as well as phosphorylation of p70S6K's natural substrate S6 protein in S235/S236. Overexpression of a lipase inactive mutant (K758R), however, failed to induce an increase in both PLD and S6K activity or phosphorylation, indicating that the enzymatic activity of PLD2 (i.e., synthesis of PA) must be present to affect S6K. Neither inhibiting mTOR kinase activity with rapamycin nor silencing mTOR gene expression altered the augmentative effect of PLD2 exerted on p70S6K activity. This finding indicates that PA binds to and activates p70S6K, even in the absence of mTOR. Lastly, COS-7 transfection with PLD2 changed the pattern of subcellular expression, and a colocalization of S6K and PLD2 was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. These results show for the first time a direct (mTOR-independent) participation of PLD in the p70S6K pathway and implicate PA as a nexus that brings together cell phospholipases and kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2007374663,"Calcium induces epidermal keratinocyte differentiation, but the mechanism is not completely understood. We have previously demonstrated that calcium-induced human keratinocyte differentiation requires an intracellular calcium rise caused by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent activation of phospholipase C-γ1. In this study we sought to identify the upstream signaling pathway necessary for calcium activation of PI3K and its subsequent activation of phospholipase C-γ1. We found that calcium induces the recruitment of PI3K to the E-cadherin-catenin complex at the plasma membrane of human keratinocytes. Knocking-down E-cadherin, β-catenin, or p120-catenin expression blocked calcium activation of PI3K and phospholipase C-γ1 and calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation. However, knocking-down γ-catenin expression had no effect. Calcium-induced PI3K recruitment to E-cadherin stabilized by p120-catenin at the plasma membrane requires β-catenin but not γ-catenin. These data indicate that the recruitment of PI3K to the E-cadherin/β-catenin/p120-catenin complex via β-catenin at the plasma membrane is required for calcium-induced phospholipase C-γ1 activation and, ultimately, keratinocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2103310889,"Nna1 has some sequence similarity to metallocarboxypeptidases, but the biochemical characterization of Nna1 has not previously been reported. In this work we performed a detailed genomic scan and found >100 Nna1 homologues in bacteria, Protista, and Animalia, including several paralogs in most eukaryotic species. Phylogenetic analysis of the Nna1-like sequences demonstrates a major divergence between Nna1-like peptidases and the previously known metallocarboxypeptidases subfamilies: M14A, M14B, and M14C. Conformational modeling of representative Nna1-like proteins from a variety of species indicates an unusually open active site, a property that might facilitate its action on a wide variety of peptide and protein substrates. To test this, we expressed a recombinant form of one of the Nna1-like peptidases from Caenorhabditis elegans and demonstrated that this protein is a fully functional metallocarboxypeptidase that cleaves a range of C-terminal amino acids from synthetic peptides. The enzymatic activity is activated by ATP/ADP and salt-inactivated, and is preferentially inhibited by Z-Glu-Tyr dipeptide, which is without precedent in metallocarboxypeptidases and resembles tubulin carboxypeptidase functioning; this hypothesis is strongly reinforced by the results depicted in Kalinina et al. published as accompanying paper in this journal. Our findings demonstrate that the M14 family of metallocarboxypeptidases is more complex and diverse than expected, and that Nna1-like peptidases are functional variants of such enzymes, representing a novel subfamily (we propose the name M14D) that contributes substantially to such diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2122113563,"Sperm flagellar motion is the outcome of a dynamic interplay between the axonemal cytoskeleton, the peri-axonemal accessory structures, and multiple regulatory networks that coordinate to produce flagellar beat and waveform. Tektins are conserved components of the flagellar proteome in evolutionarily diverse species and are believed to play essential roles in the mechanics of sperm motility. Using database mining, we identified multiple new paralogs of previously annotated tektins, including tektin 4 (TEKT4), which shares 77.1% identity with its nearest human homologue. Mouse Tekt4 is a germ cell-enriched gene, most abundantly expressed in haploid round spermatids in the testis, and the protein is localized to the sperm flagella. Male mice lacking TEKT4 on a 129S5/SvEvBrd inbred background are subfertile. Tekt4-null sperm exhibit drastically reduced forward progressive velocity and uncoordinated waveform propagation along the flagellum. In Tekt4-null sperm, flagellar ultrastructure is grossly unaltered as revealed by transmission electron microscopy. However, the ineffective flagellar strokes lead to approximately 10-fold higher consumption of intracellular ATP in Tekt4-null sperm as compared to wild-type, and null spermatozoa rapidly lose progressive motility when incubated for > or = 1.5 h. Our studies demonstrate that TEKT4 is necessary for the proper coordinated beating of the sperm flagellum and male reproductive physiology."

In addition, oxalate toxicity is a concern for the commercial application of fungi in the food and drug industries.

Below, we report the cloning of the Botrytis cinerea oahA gene and the demonstration that the disruption of this gene results in the loss of oxalate formation. In addition, through complementation we have shown that the intact B. cinerea oahA gene restores oxalate production in an Aspergillus niger mutant strain, lacking a functional oahA gene. These observations clearly indicate that oxalate production in A. niger and B. cinerea is solely dependent on the hydrolytic cleavage of oxaloacetate catalyzed by OAH.

We recently initiated investigations of the oxalate biosynthetic pathway to develop a genomic-based method for distinguishing between oxalate producing and non-producing fungi. An additional goal of this effort was to identify enzyme inhibitors that could be used to arrest oxalate formation in targeted fungi. To attenuate oxalate production in fungi, it is necessary to first identify the major pathway responsible for oxalate formation. There are three potential routes for production of oxalate in fungi: oxidation of glyoxylate (8Maxwell D.P. Bateman D.F. Phytopathology. 1968; 58: 1635-1642Google Scholar, 9Balmforth A.J. Thomson A. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), oxidation of glycolaldehyde (10Hammel K.E. Mozuch M.D. Jensen Jr., K.A. Kersten P.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13349-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and hydrolysis of oxaloacetate (11Lenz H. Wunderwald P. Eggerer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The results of studies of [14C]CO2 incorporation into the metabolite pools of A. niger indicate that oxalate is derived from oxaloacetate (12Kubicek C.P. Schreferl-Kunar G. Wohrer W. Rohr M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 633-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding parallels the results of earlier work on the purification of an enzyme “oxalacetalase” (now known as oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase or OAH) 4The abbreviations used are: OAH, oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of oxaloacetate to form acetate and oxalate (11Lenz H. Wunderwald P. Eggerer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In a subsequent study, a mutant A. niger strain, NW228 (13Van den Hombergh J.P. Van de Vondervoort P.J. Van der Heijden N.C. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was found to be deficient in both oxalate production and in the synthesis of active OAH (14Ruijter G.J. van de Vondervoort P.J. Visser J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2569-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that oxalate is produced only by the OAH catalyzed process. In the present investigation, we verified the connection between the absence of oxalate formation and the absence of OAH activity in the NW228 mutant by demonstrating that the OAH encoding oahA gene is interrupted by a stop codon. In an independent effort, Pedersen et al. (15Pedersen H. Christensen B. Hjort C. Nielsen J. Metab. Eng. 2000; 2: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) mutated the A. niger oahA gene by recombination with an oahA sequence-based plasmid, to create a metabolically robust A. niger strain deficient in oxalate production. OAH isolated from A. niger is reported to be a mixture of N-terminal truncates (16Pedersen H. Hjort C. Nielsen J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To obtain homogeneous OAH, we first cloned the A. niger oahA gene for overexpression in Escherichia coli. However, we failed to isolate active transformants. Subsequent efforts focused on cloning the oahA gene from the alternate fungal source B. cinerea (previously known as Botryotinia fuckeliana). The cloned B. cinera oahA gene was shown to both restore oxalate production in the A. niger NW228 mutant strain (13Van den Hombergh J.P. Van de Vondervoort P.J. Van der Heijden N.C. Visser J. Curr.

To provide insight into the mechanism of catalysis and to set the stage for the design of mechanism-based inhibitors, the OAH substrate and metal cofactor specificities were determined. Below we report the results from these studies, which have culminated in the discovery that 3,3-difluorooxaloacetate is a novel tight-binding OAH inhibitor. Oxaloacetic acid, (R)-malic acid, (S)-malic acid, (2R)-methylmalic acid, (2S)-methylmalic acid, and (2R,3S)-isocitric acid were purchased from Sigma. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalic acid, (2R)-ethyl-(3S)-methylmalic acid, (2R)-propyl-(3S)-methylmalic acid, threo-(2R,3S and 2S,3R)-2-methylisocitrate were prepared according to Ref. 17Lu Z. Feng X. Song L.

(2R,3S)-Isopropylmalate (synthesized by M. Jung) and 3-butylmalate (Aldrich Rare Chemicals, number S789046) were provided by S. Clarke (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). This compound was prepared by modifying the protocol described by Saxty et al. (18Saxty B.A. Novelli R. Dolle R.E. Kruse L.I. Reid D.G. Camilleri P. Wells T.N.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 202: 889-896Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A stirred suspension of zinc powder (6.5 g, 0.1 mol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (50 ml) containing Me3SiCl (4 ml, 0.04 mol) was stirred at room temperature for 15 min and then at reflux while ethyl bromodifluoroacetate (24.24 g, 0.12 mol) was added. To this solution was added ethyl formylformate (5.2 g, 0.05 mol) at a rate sufficient to maintain gentle reflux. After stirring at reflux for 1 h, the solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was dissolved in water and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The extracts were washed with water, dried, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (methylene chloride and 1:5 ethyl acetate/hexane) to give diethyl 2,2-difluoro-3-hydroxysuccinate (7.9 g, 69%). To a solution of sulfuric acid (10 ml, 0.18 mol) and pyridinium chlorochromate (0.093 mol) in water (40 ml) was added diethyl 2,2-difluoro-3-hydroxysuccinate (7.0 g, 0.031 mol) dropwise. After stirring at room temperature for 7 h, the mixture was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to give a residue, which was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (10:1 to 3:1 ethyl acetate/hexane) to yield homogeneous diethyl 3,3-difluorooxaloacetate (3.75 g, 50%). The spectroscopic data of this substance matched those reported earlier (19Alberg D.G. Lauhon C.T. Nyfeler R. Fassler A. Bartlett P.A. J. Am. Chem.

A mixture of diethyl 3,3-difluorooxalacetate (1.70 g, 7.0 mmol) and 13 ml of 3 m HCl was stirred at reflux for 1.3 h, cooled to room temperature, and concentrated in vacuo. Addition of 2 ml of trifluoroacetic acid to the residue resulted in the formation of a solid, which was filtered and dried in vacuo to yield 3,3-difluorooxaloacetate (1.18 g, 90%). In agreement with a previous report (19Alberg D.G. Lauhon C.T. Nyfeler R. Fassler A. Bartlett P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3535-3546Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the 13C NMR (D2O) spectrum is as follows: 169.9, 165.4 (t, J = 29.4 Hz), 112.0 (t, J = 261.1 Hz), and 92.0 (t, J = 27.2 Hz). The oahA genes from the A. niger wild type strain N400 (CBS120.49), and derived mutant strains NW228 (prtF28) and NW229 (prtF29) (13Van den Hombergh J.P. Van de Vondervoort P.J. Van der Heijden N.C. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), were amplified by using standard PCR protocol in conjunction with the forward primer CTGGCCCTTCCTTTCTATC and the reverse primer CCATCCAATGCAGTTCAAC. The PCR products were cloned using the vector pGEM®-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the N400 strain has been deposited in the public data bases under accession number AJ567910. The GenomeWalker kit (Clontech) was used to obtain the PCR product of the genomic region containing the OAH encoding gene from B. cinerea strain B05.10. The sequences of gene-specific primer 1 (ATCAACACAATATCGGAGTTCATGG) and primer 2 (GCACGAATTCTCATGT-AGTACTCCTCT) were derived from B. cinerea EST AL117176. The complete oah gene along with 308 bp of the upstream region was amplified, cloned in the vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega), and sequenced. Standard reverse transcriptase-PCR techniques were used to verify the two introns. The nucleotide sequence has been deposited in the public data bases under accession number AY590264. Three different constructs were made for complementation of the prtF mutation with the B. cinerea oah gene. These are the full-length B. cinerea oah gene including the 308-bp upstream region and two fusion constructs in which the A. niger pkiA (20De Graaff L. van den Broeck H. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) promoter was fused to the two possible start codons. All three constructs where co-transformed into strain NW188 (pyrA6, prtF28) as previously described (21Kusters-van Someren M.A. Harmsen J.A. Kester H.C. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Transformants where screened for oxalate production by growing single colonies on complete media (22Pontecorvo G. Roper J.A. Hemmons L.M. Macdonald K.D. Bufton A.W. Adv. Genet. 1953; 5: 141-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) plates with 10 ng/ml methyl orange as the pH indicator. Only the transformants in which the pkiA promoter was fused to the most upstream start codon showed oxalate production as verified by HPLC analysis. The copy number of OAH B. cinerea of the transformants was determined by Southern analysis using the pkiA promoter as a radiolabeled probe. The copy number was estimated by comparing the intensity of the native A. niger pki promoter band (1 copy) to the intensity of the band of the introduced pkiA-BcoahA construct. A gene replacement construct containing fragments originating from either end of the BcoahA gene flanking a hygromycin resistance cassette (GenBank™ accession AJ439603) was prepared. The 5′-flanking fragment (466 bp) was amplified using the primers CCCAATCCTCCAAGAGAAGTC and GATTACTAACAGATATCAAGGCTTCAAGCGGGAAGCAGTGGTAC. The 3′-flanking fragment (611 bp) was amplified using primers GGGTACCGAGCTGCAATTCGTTGTGGACATCTCCAAGGC and CCAACCAGGTACTGAGATCAG. The flanking fragments were joined to the hygromycin cassette by overlap extension. The PCR mixture contained the three template fragments and primers GACTGCTACTGAGTATTCGGT and CTACTCAAACACCATCCGCGA. The resulting PCR fragment was excised from the gel and directly transformed to B. cinerea protoplasts using the published procedure (23Kars I. Wagemakers C.A.M. McCalman M. van Kan J.A.L. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2005; 6: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The OAH encoding gene was amplified by using a PCR-based strategy (24Erlick H.A. PCR Technology Principles and Applications for DNA Amplication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar) with the OAH-pGem-T Easy vector clone serving as the template. Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and oligonucleotide primers containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites were used for the subcloning the OAH gene into the pET-3c vector (Novagen). The recombinant plasmid, OAH-pET3c, was used to transform competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). The transformed cells were grown at 20 °C with mild agitation (180 rpm) in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. After 19 h of cell growth (A600 nm ∼ 0.7), induction was initiated with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d -thiogalactopyranoside (RPI Corp.). The culture was incubated for 12.5 h at 20 °C under conditions of vigorous mixing (200 rpm). The cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,500 rpm (7,808 × g)) for 15 min at 4 °C in a yield of 4 g/liter of culture media. The cell pellet (23 g) was suspended in 230 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm K+/Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamide hydrochloride, 0.05 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm DTT). The suspension was passed through a French Press at 1,200 p.s.i., and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 60 min at 20,000 rpm (48,384 × g). The supernatant was fractionated by ammonium sulfate-induced protein precipitation. The 30–40% ammonium sulfate protein precipitate was dialyzed at 4 °C against 4 × 2 liters of Buffer A (50 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT) before loading onto a 4.5 × 45-cm DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with 2 liters of Buffer A. The column was washed with 1 liter of Buffer A, and then eluted with a 2-liter linear gradient of 0 to 0.3 m KCl in Buffer A. The column fractions were analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and by carrying out SDS-PAGE analysis. Ammonium sulfate was added to the combined fractions to generate 20% saturation. The resulting solution was loaded onto a 3 × 30-cm Butyl-Sepharose column equilibrated at 4 °C with 20% ammonium sulfate in 500 ml of Buffer A. The column was washed with 450 ml of 20% ammonium sulfate in Buffer A and then eluted with a 1-liter linear gradient of 20 to 0% ammonium sulfate in Buffer A. The column fractions were analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and by carrying out SDS-PAGE analysis. The OAH eluted at 4% ammonium sulfate. The OAH-containing fractions were combined, concentrated at 4 °C with an Amicon concentrator (Amicon), and then dialyzed against Buffer A. The resulting sample was concentrated using a MACROSEP 10K OMEGA for storage at –80 °C. The protein sample was shown to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE analysis with a yield of 4 mg of protein/g wet cell. OAH was chromatographed on a SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex Co.) and subjected to automated protein N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Dr. Brian M. Martin of the National Institutes of Mental Health (Molecular Structure Unit, Department of Neurotoxicolgy, Bethesda, MD) to obtain the sequence PAYSDKVMLT. The theoretical subunit molecular mass of recombinant OAH was calculated by using the amino acid composition, derived from the gene sequence, and the EXPASY Molecular Biology Server program Compute pI/MW (25Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The subunit size of recombinant OAH was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis with molecular weight standards from Invitrogen. The subunit mass was determined by MS-ES mass spectrometry (University of New Mexico Mass Spectrometry Lab). The molecular weight of native recombinant OAH was first determined using gravity flow gel filtration techniques. The chromatography of OAH was carried out with a 1.5 × 180-cm Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer B (25 mm K+/Hepes, 0.15 m KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.5) at 4 °C. The Pharmacia Gel Filtration Calibration Kit (catalase, 232,000; aldolase, 158,000; albumin, 67,000; ovalbumin, 43,000; chymotrypsinogen A, 25,000; ribonuclease A, 13,000) was used to calibrate the column according to the manufacturer's instructions. The chromatography was carried out at 4 °C using Buffer B as eluant and a peristaltic pump to maintain a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The plot of the elution volume of the molecular weight standards versus log molecular weight was found to be linear. The OAH molecular weight was thus derived from the measured elution volume by extrapolation. OAH native mass was also analyzed at the HHMI Biopolymer/Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University by size exclusion chromatography coupled with on-line laser scattering, refractive index, and ultraviolet detection. OAH activity was assayed according to a published procedure (11Lenz H. Wunderwald P. Eggerer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Reaction solutions (1 ml) contained 0.06–1.0 mm oxaloacetate, 0.032 μm OAH, and 5 mm MgCl2 or 0.18–1.2 mm oxaloacetate, 0.011 μm OAH, and 0.3 mm MnCl2 in 0.1 m imidazole (pH 7.6 and 25 °C). The reaction was monitored at 255 nm for the disappearance of the enol tuatomer of oxaloacetate (Δϵ = 1.1 mm–1 cm–1). The rate of oxaloacetate consumption via spontaneous decarboxylation was measured prior to initiating the enzymatic reaction to determine the “background rate.” The background rate was subtracted from the reaction rate measured in the presence of OAH. The influence of the buffer properties on the OAH kinetic behavior was tested by replacing the 0.1 m imidazole of the reaction solutions with 50 mm K+/Hepes (pH 7.5) or 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Continuous Assay—The OAH (13 μm) lyase activity toward 1 mm (R)-malate, (S)-malate, (2S)-methylmalate, (2R,3S)-isocitrate, threo-(2R,3S and 2S,3R)-2-methylisocitrate, (2R,3S)-isopropylmalate, or 3-butylmalate was measured using 1-ml reaction solutions containing 5 mm MgCl2, 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.2 mm NADH in 50 mm K+/Hepes (pH 7.5 and 25 °C). The absorbance of the solution was monitored at 340 nm (Δϵ = 6.2 mm–1 cm–1). The kinetic constants for OAH lysis of (2R)-methylmalate, (2R,3S)-dimethylmalate, and (2R)-ethyl-(3S)-methylmalate were determined with assay solutions in which the reactant concentration is varied from 0.5 Km to 10 Km. In the case of (2R)-ethyl-(3S)-methylmalate, reaction solutions contained 600 units of lactate dehydrogenase. Fixed Time Assay—Reaction solutions initially containing 6 μm OAH, 0.50–3.75 mm (2R)-propyl-(3S)-methylmalate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm K+/Hepes (pH 7.5, 25 °C) were analyzed at ∼20% conversion. A 200-μl aliquot was mixed with 200 μl of 1 n HCl and 100 μl of 0.4 m phenylhydrazine hydrochloride. The solution was stirred for 12 min before the absorbance was measured at 326 nm (2-oxovaleric acid hydrazone molar extinction constant is 6.8 mm–1 cm–1). The control reaction lacked OAH. The steady-state kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) were determined from the initial velocity data measured as a function of substrate concentration. The initial velocity data were fitted to Equation 1 with KinetAsystI, V0=Vmax[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) where [S] is the substrate concentration, V0 is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximum velocity, and Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant for the substrate. The kcat value was calculated from Vmax and the enzyme concentration using the equation kcat = Vmax/[E], where [E] is the protein subunit molar concentration in the reaction calculated from the ratio of measured protein concentration and the protein molecular mass (34,486 Da). For determination of the competitive inhibition constant Ki, the 1-ml reaction solutions initially contained 0.1 m imidazole (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 9 nm oxaloacetate hydrolase, varying concentrations of oxaloacetate (0.04–1.0 mm) and changing, fixed concentrations of difluorooxaloacetate (0, 0.2, and 0.4 μm), oxalate (0, 25, 50, and 100 μm), (R)-malate (0, 10, and 20 mm), or (S)-malate (0, 20, and 40 mm). Initial velocity data were fitted to Equation 2. V0=Vmax[S]/(Km(1+(I/Ki))+[S])(Eq. 2) The metal ion-free protein was prepared by dialysis against 7 changes of 500 ml of 30 mm EDTA, 50 mm triethanolamine, 5 mm DTT (pH 7.5, 4 °C) followed by dialysis against 6 changes of 500 ml of 50 mm triethanolamine, 5 mm DTT (pH 7.5, 4 °C). The initial velocity of oxaloacetate consumption in reaction solutions containing OAH, 1 mm oxaloacetate, and varying concentrations of MgCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2, CaCl2, ZnCl2, FeSO4, CuBr2, NiCl2 in 0.1 m imidazole (pH 7.6), 50 mm K+/HEPES (pH 7.5), or 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 25 °C. The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 1 and the computer program KinetAsystI. Cloning and Sequencing of the oahA Gene from Oxalate Non-producing Mutant Strains—The oahA genes from the A. niger mutant strains, prtF28 (NW228) and prtF29 (NW229), were sequenced and their sequences were compared with that of the oahA gene contained in the wild-type parental strain. Previous studies had shown the mutant strains lack both oxalate production and OAH activity (14Ruijter G.J. van de Vondervoort P.J. Visser J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2569-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Homberg U. Hoskins S.G. Hildebrand J.G. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 279: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, it remained to be demonstrated that the oahA gene is disrupted. The sequence analysis verified that the oahA genes from the mutant strains had acquired a stop codon in the open reading frame (at amino acid positions Arg-94 (NW228) or Gln-159 (NW229)). Furthermore, by using a pH indicator plate assay (Fig. 1) and HPLC analyses (data not shown) we demonstrated that the mutant strains, transformed with the wild type oahA gene, regain their oxalate production capability. Cloning and Disruption of the B. cinerea oahA Gene—The results from the complementation experiment described above strongly suggest that oxalate production in A. niger is caused solely by OAH-catalyzed cleavage of oxaloacetate. We scrutinized the genomes of other fungal oxalate producers to see if they too encoded OAH. BLAST searches using the A. niger oahA gene (AnoahA) as the query suggested that EST AL117176 from the oxalate producer B. cinerea represents a partial copy of the B. cinerea OAH encoding gene. The complete BcoahA gene, isolated from the B. cinerea genome by using PCR and genome walking techniques, was then used for complementation of the prtF28 mutation. The sequence of the putative BcOAH was shown to be 70% identical to that of the A. niger OAH. Because there are two possible start codons separated by 7 amino acids, three different constructs were made for complementation purposes. These are the full-length B. cinerea oahA gene (including the 308-bp upstream region calculated from the most upstream candidate start codon) and two fusion constructs, in which the constitutive A. niger pkiA promoter (20De Graaff L. van den Broeck H. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is fused to one of the two possible start codons. Complementation of the A. niger NW228 non-oxalate producing strain was achieved with the BcoahA coding region that included the most upstream start codon fused to the strong A. niger pkiA promoter (20De Graaff L. van den Broeck H. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Seven independent pkiA::BcoahA transformants were identified by using an indicator plate assay (Fig. 2). The integration of the construct within the transformants was verified by using Southern analysis (Fig. 3). HPLC analysis was used to demonstrate that each transformant had regained the ability to produce oxalate (data not shown).FIGURE 3Molecular characterization of A. niger NW228 transformants complemented with pkiA::BcoahA construct. Lanes 1 and 2, NW228 control. Lanes 3–9, 8 independent NW228 pkiA::BcoahA transformants. Lane 10, wild type control. The bands corresponding with the native pkiA gene and the construct are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the role played by the BcoahA gene in oxalate biosynthesis in B. cinerea, the gene was deleted from the B. cinerea genome by employing targeted gene replacement. Transformants, in which homologous recombination had occurred, were identified by PCR screening and Southern blot analysis. Five independent transformants were identified as having perfect gene replacement in the absence of additional ectopic integration (data not shown). The pH indicator plate assay (Fig. 2) was used to demonstrate that the BcoahA-deficient mutants do not produce a detectable level of oxalate. Purification of Recombinant B. cinerea OAH and Size Determination—The DNA sequence of the subcloned gene was found to agree with the published sequence (GenBank accession number AY590264) except that the nucleotide at position 1637 is G not A. Thus, the encoded amino acid is Ala not Thr. The recombinant OAH was purified to homogeneity in an overall yield of 4 mg/g wet cells by using the 4-step protocol summarized in Table 1. The N-terminal sequence of OAH revealed that the N-terminal methionine is lost during posttranslational modification. This was confirmed by a molecular mass determination using mass spectroscopy. The theoretical mass of OAH-Met is 34,355 Da compared with the experimental value of 34,355 ± 1 Da. The SDS-PAGE analysis gave an estimated subunit mass of 35 kDa, whereas the native mass measured by using molecular size gel filtration chromatography is ∼100 kDa. This result is indicative of a homotrimeric quaternary structure. The α,β-barrels of the enzymes of the PEP mutase/isocitrate lyase superfamily incorporate the C-terminal α-helix from an adjacent subunit, a family structural trait known as “helix swapping.” The functional unit is therefore a dimer, and the quaternary structure that has been most frequently encountered is the homotetramer (Ref. 17Lu Z. Feng X. Song L. Han Y. Kim A. Herzberg O. Woodson W.R. Martin B.M. Mariano P.S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16365-16376Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and references therein). Because a trimeric structure is not consistent with this pattern, we examined the possibility that the association state of OAH is unstable. Native molecular mass determination, by using size exclusion chromatography, coupled with on-line laser scattering, refractive index, and ultraviolet detection provide"
https://openalex.org/W2126212239,"Uncoupling proteins 1 (UCP1) and 2 (UCP2) belong to the family of mitochondrial anion transporters and share 59% sequence identity with each other. Whereas UCP1 was shown to be responsible for the rapid production of heat in brown adipose tissue, the primary function and transport properties of ubiquitously expressed UCP2 are controversially discussed. Here, for the first time, the activation pattern of the recombinant human UCP2 in comparison to the recombinant human UCP1 are studied using a well-defined system of planar lipid bilayers. It is shown that despite apparently different physiological functions, hUCP2 exhibited its protonophoric function similar to hUCP1--exclusively in the presence of long-chain fatty acids (FA). The calculated hUCP2 transport rate of 4.5 s(-1) is the same order of magnitude, as shown previously for UCP1. It leads to the conclusion that the differences in the activity of both proteins in living mitochondria are based exclusively on their different expression level. Both proteins are activated much more effectively by polyunsaturated than by saturated FA. The proton and total membrane conductances increased in the range palmitic < oleic < eicosatrienoic < linoleic < retinoic < arachidonic acids. The higher uncoupling protein (UCP)-dependent conductance in the presence of polyunsaturated FA is explained on the basis of the FA cycling hypothesis."

Therefore, maintaining and regulating a dynamic balance between CFTR-activating and CFTR-inactivating machineries is an important mechanism for maintaining body homeostasis. Accumulating evidence suggests that protein-protein interactions play a critical role in the regulation of CFTR and other epithelial transporters (6Lamprecht G. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: G766-G777Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Donowitz M. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Brett C.L. Sharma A. Tse C.M. Li X. J.

PDZ (PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1) domain-based adaptors, best studied in the postsynaptic density (PSD) region of neurons, have emerged as a large group of proteins that sequester functionally related groups of transporters, receptors, and other effector proteins into integrated molecular complexes (9Funke L. Dakoji S. Bredt D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 219-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 10Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells also utilize specific PDZ proteins to direct the polarized activities in their apical and basolateral membranes. Recently we reported functional and physical associations between the PDZ domain-containing protein Shank2 and two epithelial transporters, CFTR and the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) (11Han W. Kim K.H.

Interestingly Shank2 attenuated the cAMP-dependent regulation of CFTR and NHE3. Conversely it has been shown that PDZ domain-based adaptors, such as EBP50/NHERF1 and E3KARP/NHERF2, can enhance the effects of cAMP on these transporters by recruiting a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)/PKA-anchoring protein (AKAP) complex (13Weinman E.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Physiological significance of these adaptors in the regulation of CFTR function has also been verified in many other studies (6Lamprecht G. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: G766-G777Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For example, recent evidence demonstrates that native CFTR and EBP50 are co-immunoprecipitated in human airway epithelial cells (15Taouil K. Hinnrasky J. Hologne C. Corlieu P. Klossek J.M. Puchelle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17320-17327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and that CFTR-dependent anion current is reduced in the intestine of EBP50 knock-out mice (6Lamprecht G. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: G766-G777Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain of Shank proteins has a three-dimensional structure very similar to the PDZ domains of EBP50/NHERF1 (16Im Y.J. Lee J.H. Park S.H. Park S.J. Rho S.H. Kang G.B. Kim E. Eom S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48099-48104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In particular, these PDZ domains all contain a negatively charged amino acid at the end of the β C strand of the PDZ domain structures (Glu43 in hEBP50, Asp634 in rShank1, and Asp80 in hShank2) that preferentially interacts with a positively charged residue at the -1 position in the C terminus of the membrane transporters, such as -TRL in CFTR. Therefore, the question arises whether EBP50 and Shank2 have distinct CFTR binding sites or mutually compete for binding of a single site in cells expressing both adaptor proteins. In the present study, we determined the kinetic properties and physiological significance of the interactions between CFTR and the PDZ-based adaptors EBP50 and Shank2. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, we found that the dissociation constant (KD) of CFTR-Shank2 binding was similar to that of CFTR-EBP50 binding and that both proteins apparently compete for binding at the same site. Consecutive patch clamp studies revealed that CFTR Cl- channel activity was dynamically regulated by the competition of Shank2 and EBP50 binding. Notably in contrast to the PKA/AKAP recruitment by EBP50 (6Lamprecht G. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: G766-G777Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), Shank2 was found to tether PDE4D to the CFTR complex, thus attenuating cAMP/PKA signals. Our results suggest that the competitive balance between Shank2 and EBP50 binding to the CFTR channel may maintain homeostatic regulation of epithelial ion and fluid transport. Cell Cultures and Plasmid Vectors—NIH 3T3 and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. T84 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL-248) and maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum.

Conti M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). SPR Measurements and Kinetic Analysis of Sensorgrams— PDZ1-(1–139), PDZ2-(132–299), and PDZ1+2-(1–299) domains of hEBP50/NHERF1 and the PDZ domain of rShank2/CortBP1-(1–142) were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pRSET A vector (Invitrogen) to create His-tagged constructs. The C-terminal 29 amino acid residues of hCFTR (GenBank™ accession number NM_000492) and PDZ1+2 of hEBP50 (for competition assay, see Fig. 1D) were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to create GST fusion constructs. All constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. All fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) and glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as appropriate. The purified proteins were quantified using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and their purity was assessed as >90% by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels. An SPR system equipped with an NTA chip (BIAcore 3000; Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to capture His-tagged PDZ fusion proteins. Analytes (GST-tagged proteins) at various concentrations in HEPES-buffered saline-EP (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4) were perfused at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The sensor chip was regenerated between each analysis using successive injections of solutions containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.35 m EDTA. Response curves were generated by subtracting the background signal generated simultaneously by the control flow cell. Background-subtracted curves were prepared for fitting by subtracting the signal generated by buffer alone on experimental flow cells. Sensorgram curves and kinetic parameters were evaluated by the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (Biacore AB), which uses numerical integration algorithms. Measurement of Cl- Channel Activities—Whole-cell recordings were performed on CFTR-transfected CHO-K1 cells as reported previously (19Namkung W. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1979-1990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained 140 mm N-methyl d-glucamine chloride (NMDG-Cl), 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Tris-ATP, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and the bath solution contained 140 mm N-methyl d-glucamine chloride, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). After establishing the whole-cell configuration, CFTR was activated by adding forskolin and/or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). The holding potential used was -30 mV, and the current output was filtered at 5 kHz. Currents were digitized and analyzed using an AxoScope 8.1 system and a Digidata 1322A analog/digital converter (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Single channel activity of CFTR was measured in inside-out configurations using fire-polished pipettes with a resistance of 20–25 megaohms. The pipette solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and the bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Following patch excision, channels were activated by adding the catalytic subunit of PKA (40 unit/ml; Promega, Madison, WI) and 1 mm MgATP. After channel activation, EBP50 and/or Shank2-PDZ at desired concentrations was added to the bath. Holding voltage used in the single channel recording was +60 mV. The pCLAMP software package (version 9.2, Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. The voltage and current data were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz during the recordings, and the single channel data were further digitally filtered at 25 Hz. The number of active channels in a patch was determined from the number of simultaneously open channels during at least 15 min of recording. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed to identify the phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms in NIH 3T3 cells and T84 cells using protocols reported previously (12Kim J.Y.

Immunoprecipitation (IP), Immunoblotting, and Immunohistochemistry—CHO-K1, COS-7, T84 cells, and rat cerebellum were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After lysis, cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and cleared lysates were mixed with the appropriate antibodies and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A/G PLUS-agarose and washed four times with lysis buffer prior to electrophoresis. The immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min and then separated by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked by incubation for 1 h in a solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, and protein bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence solutions.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were described previously. Rabbit polyclonal pan-PDE4D antibody ab14613 was purchased from Abcam Inc., Cambridge, UK. Immunostaining of frozen sections was performed as reported previously (12Kim J.Y. Han W. Namkung W. Lee J.H. Kim K.H. Shin H. Kim E. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10389-10396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly colon tissues from Sprague-Dawley rats were embedded in OCT (Miles, Elkhart, IN), frozen in liquid N2, and cut into 4-μm sections. The sections were stained by incubation with polyclonal anti-Shank2 1136 and monoclonal anti-pan-PDE4D M3S1 antibodies followed by appropriate secondary antibodies tagged with fluorophores. Images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. GST Pulldown Assay—Regions corresponding to residues of rShank2 PDZ-(1–142), proline-rich (PR)-(134–1176), and sterile α motif-(1164–1253) domains were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to create GST fusion constructs. Shank2 PR domains were further dissected, and two GST fusion constructs were generated: PR1-(134–669) and PR2-(647–1176). All fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). For pulldown assays, CHO cells were lysed on ice in a 1% Triton X-100 buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and proteinase inhibitors (CompleteMini, Roche Applied Science). Debris was removed by centrifugation, and 100 μl of lysate supernatants were supplemented with 900 μlof buffer prior to addition of 10 μg of each GST fusion protein. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, samples were supplemented with 80 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for an additional 4 h at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose was pelleted and washed (3 × 5 min) at 4 °C with wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) prior to resuspension in SDS sample buffer and SDS-PAGE. Measurements of PDE Activity—Whole brain tissues from wild type and PDE4D knock-out mice (21Jin S.L. Richard F.J. Kuo W.P. D'Ercole A.J. Conti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11998-12003Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 μm microcystin, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated using 5 μl of anti-Shank2 antibody coupled to 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 4 h. After centrifugation, pellets were washed three times, and PDE activity was then measured as described previously (18Richter W. Jin S.L. Conti M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In brief, samples were assayed in a reaction mixture of 200 μl containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm cAMP, 0.75 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 μCi of [3H]cAMP for 10 min at 33 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 10 mm EDTA in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by heat inactivation in a boiling water bath for 1 min. The PDE reaction product 5′-AMP was then hydrolyzed by incubation of the assay mixture with 50 μg of Crotalus atrox snake venom for 20 min at 33 °C. The resulting adenosine was separated by anion exchange chromatography using 1 ml of AG1-X8 resin and quantitated by scintillation counting. Shank2 and EBP50 Compete for Binding on CFTR—To understand the dynamics of CFTR positive and negative regulations, we determined the binding kinetics of the association between CFTR and the PDZ domains of EBP50 and Shank2 using SPR analyses (Fig. 1). As EBP50 has two PDZ domains, three His-tagged proteins, PDZ1-(1–139), PDZ2-(132–299), and PDZ1+2-(1–299), were used to analyze their kinetics separately. His-tagged PDZ domains were captured on NTA chips, and their binding to the GST-tagged C terminus of CFTR was sensored by SPR. As shown in the sensorgrams, the PDZ domains of Shank2 and EBP50 specifically bind the C terminus of CFTR in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1, A and B). The overall dissociation constants at the equilibrium state (KD values) of Shank2 PDZ and EBP50 PDZ1+2 were within comparable ranges at the tens of nanomolar levels (Fig. 1C). Interestingly EBP50 PDZ1+2 has approximately a 1 order of magnitude faster association (Ka) and dissociation (Kd) kinetics than Shank2 PDZ. Further analyses of EBP50 PDZs using separate PDZ1 and PDZ2 proteins revealed that the overall EBP50 binding to CFTR is driven by PDZ1, which has a ∼3 times higher affinity than PDZ2 (Fig. 1C). A solution competition assay was performed to examine the possibility of mutual competition between the PDZs of Shank2 and EBP50 in binding to CFTR. After capturing His-tagged Shank2 PDZ on NTA chips, the SPR system was perfused with a fixed dose of the C terminus of CFTR (300 nm) and increasing doses of GST-tagged EBP50 PDZ1+2. Importantly the addition of EBP50 PDZs dose-dependently decreased the association between Shank2 PDZ and CFTR with an IC50 value of 91 nm (Fig. 1D). Regulation of CFTR Cl- Channel Activity by CFTR-EBP50 and CFTR-Shank2 Competitions—The above results imply that Shank2 and EBP50 compete for binding on CFTR. This competitive balance may affect CFTR ion transporting activities at the apical membrane of intestine, pancreas, and kidney epithelia, where Shank2 and EBP50 are abundantly expressed (7Donowitz M. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Brett C.L. Sharma A. Tse C.M. Li X. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Kim J.Y. Han W. Namkung W. Lee J.H. Kim K.H. Shin H. Kim E. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10389-10396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the effects of the competition between EBP50 and Shank2 PDZ binding on the CFTR Cl- channel activity using inside-out configurations (Fig. 2). Following patch excision from CFTR-transfected CHO cells, patch membranes were washed with a high bath flow for 5 min to eliminate endogenous activation. When CFTR was activated by the addition of the catalytic subunit of PKA and ATP to the bath solution, an ion channel activity with a single channel conductance of 7.1 ± 0.3 picosiemens and a linear current-voltage relationship was evoked that was absent in mock-transfected cells. It has been shown that adaptors with multiple PDZ domains, such as EBP50 and CAP70/PDZK1, can activate CFTR Cl- channel activity independently of cAMP signals by altering protein conformation including multimerization (23Raghuram V. Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 24Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In agreement with these reports, treatment with EBP50 (100 nm) induced a 2.8-fold increase in the open probability (Po) of CFTR. Importantly addition of Shank2 PDZ (300 nm) inhibited the EBP50-induced increase in CFTR Po by 75 ± 8% (Fig. 2, A and C). The effect of Shank2 PDZ versus EBP50 competition was then examined in reverse order. Shank2 PDZ treatment alone did not evoke significant changes in CFTR Po at basal levels; however, it greatly inhibited the CFTR activation mediated by EBP50. Addition of EBP50 induced only a minor increase in CFTR Po after Shank2 pretreatment (Fig. 2, B and D). When performing the above experiments using EBP50 PDZ1+2, which does not bind AKAPs due to the lack of the ezrin-radixin-mosesin (ERM) domain, we obtained results similar to those using the entire EBP50 protein (Fig. 2, C and D). These findings indicate that Shank2 can reversibly inhibit the EBP50-induced CFTR activation by competing with EBP50 for binding at the C terminus of CFTR and hence by breaching the EBP50-induced active conformation of CFTR. However, this does not explain the observation that Shank2 inhibits the cAMP-induced phosphorylation and activation of CFTR in living cells. In CFTR-expressing NIH 3T3 cells, it has been shown that Shank2 overexpression decreased CFTR channel activity and phosphorylation induced by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (12Kim J.Y. Han W. Namkung W. Lee J.H. Kim K.H. Shin H. Kim E. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10389-10396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is well known that CFTR is primarily activated by phosphorylation of the R-domain by PKA (2Quinton P.M. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S3-S22Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Recruitment by Shank2 of cyclic nucleotide PDEs, which attenuate cAMP signals, or phosphatases, which offset the action of PKA, might explain these findings. The latter is unlikely, however, because CFTR phosphorylation was decreased in the Shank2-transfected cells even in the presence of a high concentration of the nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor NaVO4 (12Kim J.Y. Han W. Namkung W. Lee J.H. Kim K.H. Shin H. Kim E. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10389-10396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Shank2 Associates with PDE4D—An important clue was obtained in an experiment with the non-selective PDE inhibitor IBMX (Fig. 3, A–D). Stimulation of CFTR-expressing CHO cells with 3 μm forskolin induced a CFTR Cl- current that is dependent on the presence of Cl- in bath and pipette solutions, is inhibited by 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoate, and has linear current-voltage relationships in whole-cell configurations. However, when Shank2 was co-expressed, the same amount of forskolin produced very small or no CFTR currents. Interestingly additional treatment with IBMX evoked a robust CFTR current in Shank2-expressing cells, although its peak amplitude was still 56 ± 7% that of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest a functional association between the PDE activity and the Shank2-mediated inhibition of CFTR. We next identified the PDE subtypes involved and determined whether Shank2 directly interacts with PDEs. Of the 11 PDE families, PDE3 and PDE4 are strong candidates for Shank2 association as they are sensitive to IBMX and are known to be expressed in epithelial cells (25Mehats C. Andersen C.B. Filopanti M. Jin S.L. Conti M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 29-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The PDE3 family consists of two genes, 3A and 3B, and the PDE4 family consists of four, 4A–4D. Reverse transcription-PCR results using primers specific to the common regions of mouse and human PDEs revealed that several PDE3 and PDE4 genes, including PDE3A, -4A, and -4D, are expressed in mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells and human colonic T84 cells (Fig. 3E). As both PDE3 and PDE4 are expressed, the patch clamp experiment shown in Fig. 3B was repeated after pretreatment of the cells with the PDE3-specific inhibitor trequinsin and the PDE4-specific inhibitor rolipram (Fig. 3, C and D). PDE3 inhibition did not alter the effects of Shank2 (Fig. 3C). Conversely when PDE4 was inhibited by rolipram, 3 μm forskolin consistently induced a robust CFTR current in Shank2-expressing cells (Fig. 3D, n = 5), strongly suggesting an association between Shank2 and PDE4 isoforms. Recently two reports suggested that PDE4D plays a major role in forming a cAMP diffusion barrier at the apical regions of epithelial cells (22Barnes A.P. Livera G. Huang P. Sun C. O'Neal W.K.

https://openalex.org/W1993630271,"Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc metalloprotease that degrades the amyloid β-peptide, the key component of Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated senile plaques. We have previously reported evidence for genetic linkage and association of AD on chromosome 10q23–24 in the region harboring the IDE gene. Here we have presented the first functional assessment of IDE in AD families showing the strongest evidence of the genetic linkage. We have examined the catalytic activity and expression of IDE in lymphoblast samples from 12 affected and unaffected members of three chromosome 10-linked AD pedigrees in the National Institute of Mental Health AD Genetics Initiative family sample. We have shown that the catalytic activity of cytosolic IDE to degrade insulin is reduced in affected versus unaffected subjects of these families. Further, we have shown the decrease in activity is not due to reduced IDE expression, suggesting the possible defects in IDE function in these AD families. In attempts to find potential mutations in the IDE gene in these families, we have found no coding region substitutions or alterations in splicing of the canonical exons and exon 15b of IDE. We have also found that total IDE mRNA levels are not significantly different in sporadic AD versus age-matched control brains. Collectively, our data suggest that the genetic linkage of AD in this set of chromosome 10-linked AD families may be the result of systemic defects in IDE activity in the absence of altered IDE expression, further supporting a role for IDE in AD pathogenesis. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc metalloprotease that degrades the amyloid β-peptide, the key component of Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated senile plaques. We have previously reported evidence for genetic linkage and association of AD on chromosome 10q23–24 in the region harboring the IDE gene. Here we have presented the first functional assessment of IDE in AD families showing the strongest evidence of the genetic linkage.

Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) 2The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β-protein; AD, Alzheimer disease; LOAD, late onset AD; IDE, insulin-degrading enzyme; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; NSE, neuron-specific enolase. 2The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β-protein; AD, Alzheimer disease; LOAD, late onset AD; IDE, insulin-degrading enzyme; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; NSE, neuron-specific enolase. is the primary component of senile plaques, a pathological hallmark in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Elevated levels of cerebral Aβ have also been observed in AD patients (1Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 2Ingelsson M.

Unlike early onset autosomal dominant AD, the vast majority of AD cases do not show any clear evidence of Mendelian transmission and predominantly present with late onset AD (LOAD) (onset age >65). However, there is evidence that genetic factors play a significant role in modifying the disease risk/age of onset in the majority of LOAD cases (3Tanzi R.E. Bertram L.

To date, only the ɛ4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) has been firmly established as a LOAD genetic risk factor and has been proposed to be involved in Aβ clearance (5Strittmatter W.J.

Cerebral Aβ accumulation has been proposed to greatly influence the age of onset of LOAD and is determined by the amount of Aβ generated versus the amount that is degraded and exported from the brain over one’s lifetime (6Savage M.J.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). IDE, also called insulysin, is a zinc metalloprotease that cleaves small polypeptides, many of which share amyloid fibril-forming ability, including insulin, atrial naturetic peptide, amylin, calcitonin, and Aβ (8Bennett R.G.

Our recent report on meta-analyses across all published studies (12 published reports for IDE to date) reveals a significant association of IDE with AD (21Bertram L. McQueen M.B. Mullin K. Blacker D. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar), confirming our original finding on the association and linkage of IDE to AD (17Bertram L. Blacker D. Mullin K.

However, neither pathogenic nor protective IDE gene mutations/variants have yet been validated in AD patients.In an effort to localize novel AD genes, our group previously performed a full-genome linkage screen of the National Institute of Mental Health AD Genetics Initiative family sample (22Blacker D. Bertram L. Saunders A.J. Moscarillo T.J. Albert M.S. Wiener H. Perry R.T. Collins J.S. Harrell L.E. Go R.C. Mahoney A. Beaty T. Fallin M.D. Avramopoulos D. Chase G.A. Folstein M.F. McInnis M.G.

In the current study, we chose three families showing the strongest evidence for linkage to IDE and systematically assessed the activity and expression of IDE in immortalized lymphoblast cell lines from these families. Potential alteration of IDE expression was also investigated in sporadic AD brains to confirm the result from the family-based lymphoblast samples.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLymphoblastoid Cell Culture—Lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected and unaffected subjects of the three chromosome 10-linked families (total 12 samples) were obtained from The Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository in New Jersey, and a control lymphoblast (GM7044) unrelated to the AD families was obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository. Among the affecteds, three subjects were male and two were female. The average age at death was 79.7 (±3.9 S.E.) years and the average age of onset was 72.1 (±3.7 S.E.) years. Of the unaffecteds, one subject was male and six were female, with the average age at death of 67.2 (±6.5 S.E.) years. Lymphoblasts were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). After inoculating the same number of living cells, exponentially growing lymphoblasts were collected for analysis.Human Brain Samples—Temporal neocortical tissue from 24 AD brains and 11 control brains without any signs of a neurological disorder were included in the study. All AD subjects had been evaluated at the Memory Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and met both the clinical (NINCDS-ADRDA) (23McKhann G. Drachman D. Folstein M. Katzman R. Price D. Stadlan E.M. Neurology. 1984; 34: 939-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the neuropathological (CERAD, NIA/Reagan) (24Mirra S.S. Heyman A. McKeel D. Sumi S.M. Crain B.J. Brownlee L.M. Vogel F.S.

Nine of the non-neurological control brains had been autopsied at Massachusetts General Hospital, whereas two control brains were from the Harvard Brain Bank and University of Maryland, respectively. Of the AD cases, 58% were male and 42% female. The average age at death was 80.8 years (±1.6 S.E.) with a 15.6-h (±2.8 S.E.) post-mortal interval. Thirteen of the AD cases were APOE-ɛ4-positive (ɛ4+). Among the control subjects, 50% were male and 50% female, with an average age at death of 82.4 years (±1.6 S.E.) years and with a 25.7-h (±5.6 S.E.) post-mortal interval. Two of the control subjects were ɛ4+.In Vitro Insulin Degradation Assay—After collecting lymphoblast cells, membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared by centrifugation of homogenized cell extracts at 100,000 × g for 1 has described by Huang et al. (26Huang J. Guan H. Booze R.M. Eckman C.B. Hersh L.B. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 367: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Insulin-degrading activity was assayed as described by Song et al. (27Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Fried M.G. Wagner S.L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54216-54220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, lymphoblast fractions (0.5–2.0 ml) were incubated with 50 nm tyrosine A14-labeled 125I-insulin (Amersham Biosciences) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) at 37 °C for 15 min (cytosol) or 120 min (membrane). Intact insulin was then removed by precipitation with 7.5% trichloroacetic acid. Following centrifugation, the degradation products of iodinated insulin, which remain in the supernatant, were counted on a γ counter. Blanks were run with the extract omitted and used for subtracting backgrounds. The degradation rate in pmol/min/mg was calculated from the average of the counts/min values in the trichloroacetic acid supernatant, the specific radioactivity of the iodinated insulin, and the amount of protein in the reaction. The assay was performed in duplicate in all families, whereas four independent measurements were performed for families II and III. The averages were calculated within and across the families.In Vitro Aβ Degradation Assay—Lymphoblast samples were disrupted by incubation in hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and extrusion through a 22-gauge hypodermic needle three times. The post-nuclear homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to separate cytosolic (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions, and protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Fluorometric quantification of Aβ degradation was performed using FAβB (fluorescein-Aβ-(1–40)-Lys(LC-biotin)) as described by Leissring et al. (28Leissring M.A. Lu A. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Stein R.L. Farris W. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37314-37320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 mg of protein was incubated with 0.5 mm FAβB for 90 min at 20 °C in a degradation buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). The reactions were quenched by adding avidin to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and fluorescence polarization (485 excitation, 535 emission) was determined on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Victor2 multilabel plate reader. Reactions were performed in quadruplicate in the presence and absence of 10 μm insulin, a relatively specific inhibitor of IDE activity, and the percentage of hydrolysis was calculated from standards containing no protease or excess recombinant IDE.RNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted from lymphoblast samples using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of the total RNA was determined using an NP-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop). For brain samples, a 30–50-mg piece of gray matter from the superior temporal sulcus was dissected under stringent RNase-free conditions from each brain in accordance with previously published methods (29Ingelsson M. Ramasamy K. Cantuti-Castelvetri I. Skoglund L. Matsui T. Orne J. Kowa H. Raju S. Vanderburg C.R. Augustinack J.C. de Silva R. Lees A.J. Lannfelt L. Growdon J.H. Frosch M.P. Standaert D.G. Irizarry M.C. Hyman B.T. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 2006; Google Scholar). From each tissue, RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). All samples were controlled for integrity of the 18 and 28 S ribosomal RNAs by microcapillary electrophoresis (not shown) (RNA 6000 Nano Assay, Agilent Technologies), and samples showing degradation were excluded from the study.Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)—For the lymphoblast samples, first-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 5 μg of the total RNA using 200 units of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. To investigate alternatively spliced transcript variants, RT-PCR was carried out using the cDNAs as templates with TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen) or Turbo Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and corresponding primers (Table 1). For the brain tissue samples, reverse transcription was carried out on 2 μg of all total RNA samples to generate an equal number of cDNA copies using random hexamers and 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.TABLE 1Primers and a probe used in this studyNameSequenceIDE TaqMan probe5′-ATGCAGCCTGCTTTGTT-3′IDE forward primer-TaqMan5′-GAAGCCCTTCTCCATGGAAACAT-3′IDE reverse primer-TaqMan5′-AGGGTGTCTTCAACCATCTGCATAA-3′IDE 1F5′-GCAAGCAGGAAGCGTTTG-3′IDE 5R5′-CAATGCCTTCTTGGTTTGGT-3′IDE 6F5′-CCTGAACACCCTTTCCAAGA-3′IDE 13R5′-AAGAGCAGGGTATGGTGTCG-3′IDE 14F5′-CCGAAGGCTTGTCTCAACTT-3′IDE 15a-R5′-ATACATCCCATAGATGGTATTTTGG-3′IDE 15b-R5′-TGCATTCATTCCTGATGCAATGC-3′IDE 17R5′-GCCACTTCAGTCATCAGCAA-3′IDE 19R5′-AACCAGCTGACTTGGAAGGA-3′IDE 20F5′-GAGGATGGTTTGTTTATCAGCAG-3′IDE 25R5′-AAAGTGGCCAAGATGATTTTC-3′GAPDH forward primer5′-GGTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACA-3′GAPDH reverse primer5′-GTGAGGGTCTCTCTCTTCCT-3′NSE forward primer5′-CGCCACTACCACCGTCTGA-3′NSE reverse primer5′-TAGAGGCTCCACTGGGCACTG-3′ Open table in a new tab Quantitative RT-PCR—All quantitative PCR analyses were performed with iCycler™ (Bio-Rad). To determine IDE mRNA levels in the lymphoblast and brain samples, a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled TaqMan probe and a set of PCR primers (forward and reverse primers-TaqMan, Table. 1) were synthesized (Applied Biosystems), and quantitative PCR was performed on equal amounts of cDNA from each sample using TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The IDE mRNA levels were measured in triplicates with four independent experiments and determined by the standard curve method. Relative IDE mRNA levels were calculated by normalization with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or neuron-specific enolase (NSE, ENO2) mRNA levels, which were generated by quantitative PCR on the same cDNA samples using the SyBR Green I detection system (Applied Biosystems). Forward and reverse primers for GAPDH and NSE were designed with Primer Express™ software (PE Applied Biosystems) and synthesized (Qiagen). Each PCR product was sequenced to confirm its identity. For levels of exons 15a- and 15b-specific IDE mRNAs in the lymphoblast samples, a common forward primer residing in exon 14 (IDE 14F in Table 1) and either of the reverse primers specific for exon 15a or 15b were used for SyBR Green quantitative RT-PCR. The quantitative RT-PCR was done in triplicates with three independent experiments. Each exon-specific amplified DNA fragment was confirmed by sequencing. The pCR2.1 vectors (Invitrogen) harboring the same PCR fragments with exons 15a or 15b were utilized to generate standard curves. All of the PCR primer pairs for quantitative RT-PCR were located in different exons to avoid possible amplification of genomic DNA. Sequences of all of the primers and the probe are listed in Table 1.Western Blot Analysis—Total cell extracts were obtained by resuspending lymphoblast cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% cholic acid, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA). The total lysates were separated on 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen), transferred to immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and hybridized with IDE polyclonal antibody (IDE-1, (11Vekrellis K. Ye Z. Qiu W.Q. Walsh D. Hartley D. Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and actin monoclonal antibody (pan Ab-5, Neo-Markers). Quantification of the chemiluminescence signal was accomplished using the VersaDoc imaging system and the Quantity One quantification program (Bio-Rad). Relative IDE protein levels were calculated by normalization of IDE levels with actin signals, and averages from four independent experiments were taken.RESULTSIDE Activity in the Chromosome 10-Linked AD Families—We first assessed IDE activity in the lymphoblast cell lines derived from 12 subjects of three AD families exhibiting particularly strong evidence of genetic linkage to chromosome 10 in the IDE gene region (17Bertram L. Blacker D. Mullin K. Keeney D. Jones J. Basu S. Yhu S. McInnis M.G. Go R.C. Vekrellis K. Selkoe D.J. Saunders A.J. Tanzi R.E.

Genet. 2003; 12: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Because insulin possesses a high affinity for IDE and is a major substrate of this peptidase, we employed a sensitive and reliable insulin degradation assay to assess IDE catalytic activity in membrane and cytosolic fractions prepared from lymphoblast samples (Fig. 1A). Peptidolytic activity of cytosolic IDE was significantly decreased in the affected versus unaffected subjects (>50%; p = 0.001) after combining the members of all three families. Additionally, in one family (I), cytosolic activity of IDE was significantly lower in three affected versus three unaffected subjects (p = 0.008). IDE activity was also decreased in the membrane fractions of the affected (versus unaffected) individuals; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance.To confirm our finding of decreased cytosolic IDE activity particularly in families I and III, affecteds of which exhibited the most robust decreases in IDE activity in the insulin degradation assay, peptidolytic activity of IDE was next assayed using Aβ1–40 as a substrate (Fig. 1B). IDE-mediated degradation of Aβ was decreased in affected versus unaffected subjects in both families. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance at least partly because of the less sensitive nature of this assay (versus the insulin-degrading assay) and lower affinity of IDE for Aβ. Meanwhile, we could not obtain reliable data for the Aβ-degrading ability of membrane IDE, possibly because of the limiting amount of IDE in the membrane fractions and decreased affinity of IDE for Aβ.IDE Expression in the Chromosome 10-Linked AD Families—We next assessed IDE expression by performing quantitative RT-PCR on cDNAs generated from lymphoblast cell lines from the same three AD families. The mRNA levels of IDE, normalized to GAPDH, were highly variable across samples and revealed no significant or consistent differences among affected versus unaffected subjects across the families (Fig. 2, A and B, top). The families also exhibited differing trends for IDE mRNA levels in affected versus unaffected individuals; e.g. in family I, affected subjects had lower IDE mRNA levels than the unaffecteds (p = 0.022), whereas an opposite trend was observed in family III (p = 0.020).FIGURE 2Expression of IDE in the chromosome 10-linked AD families. IDE mRNA levels were measured in lymphoblast samples from each member of the chromosome 10-linked AD families by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized with GAPDH mRNA levels (top). IDE protein levels were also determined by quantitative Western blot analysis and normalized with actin protein signals (bottom). A, graphs of the individual samples.

Relatively high IDE expression in affected versus unaffected subjects of family III was confirmed at the protein level (p = 0.018). However, the affected subjects in family I, who had relatively low IDE message levels, revealed no significant reductions in IDE protein levels. Overall, protein levels of IDE across the families did not exhibit significant or consistent differences according to disease status.Levels of Alternative IDE Transcripts in the Chromosome 10-Linked AD Families—After establishing that no IDE coding mutations existed in the canonical exons of the IDE gene in these AD families, we next explored the possibility that altered mRNA splicing of IDE may account for the observed reduction in IDE activity. First, Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA extracted from the lymphoblast samples. Two different IDE transcripts were detected (data not shown) that had similar sizes to those previously reported in rat, 3.6 and 5.9 kb (30Baumeister H. Muller D. Rehbein M. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Northern blotting using PCR fragments covering three different IDE coding regions (Fig. 3A, a), (b), and (d)) as probes, detected the two IDE mRNAs of indistinguishable sizes with no other additional bands (data not shown). Recently, Farris et al. (31Farris W. Leissring M.A. Hemming M.L. Chang A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6513-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) detected up to four different Northern blot bands of IDE in different tissues, two of which corresponded in size with the transcripts found in our lymphoblast samples. Based on the previously reported observations, we suspect that the two major IDE messages observed in these lymphoblasts are due to alternative polyadenylation sites.

Unlike other zinc proteases, BoNTs recognize extended regions of SNAP25 for cleavage; however, the molecular basis for this extended substrate recognition is unclear. Here, we define a multistep mechanism for recognition and cleavage of SNAP25 by BoNT/A. SNAP25 initially binds along the belt region of BoNT/A, which aligns the P5 residue to the S5 pocket at the periphery of the active site. Although the exact order of each step of recognition of SNAP25 by BoNT/A at the active site is not clear, the initial binding could subsequently orient the P4′-residue of SNAP25 to form a salt bridge with the S4′-residue, which opens the active site allowing the P1′-residue access to the S1′-pocket. Subsequent hydrophobic interactions between the P3 residue of SNAP25 and the S3 pocket optimize alignment of the scissile bond for cleavage. This explains how the BoNTs recognize and cleave specific coiled SNARE substrates and provides insight into the development of inhibitors to prevent botulism.

Rossetto O. Tonello F. Montecucco C. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 195: 257-274PubMed Google Scholar). There are seven BoNT serotypes, A–G, with serotypes A, B, and E responsible for most natural human intoxications (2Marvaud J.C. Raffestin S. Popoff M.R. C. R. Biol. 2002; 325: 863-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). BoNT serotypes are defined by the specificity of antibody neutralization where antibodies that neutralize one serotype fail to neutralize other serotypes. There are two licensed vaccines against botulism, a pentavalent vaccine against serotypes A–E (3Middlebrook J.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 383: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and a heptavalent vaccine against serotypes A–G (4Robinson R.F. Nahata M.C. Ann. Pharmacother. 2003; 37: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, these vaccines are produced from chemically inactivated BoNT produced in Clostridium botulinum and are currently in limited supply. BoNT intoxication has significant morbidity and mortality (5Shapiro R.L. Hatheway C. Swerdlow D.L. Ann. Intern. Med. 1998; 129: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 6Arnon S.S. Midura T.F. Damus K. Wood R.M. Chin J. Lancet. 1978; 1: 1273-1277Abstract PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a need to develop more efficient vaccines and therapies against botulism. BoNTs are zinc proteases that elicit flaccid paralysis by inhibiting the fusion of neurotransmitter-carrying vesicles to the plasma membrane of peripheral neurons. BoNTs are 150-kDa single chain proteins that are activated by proteolysis to generate disulfide-linked di-chain proteins. BoNTs are organized into three functional domains, an N-terminal catalytic domain (light chain, LC), an internal translocation domain (HCT), and a C-terminal receptor binding domain (HCR) (7Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 8Poulain B. Humeau Y. Ann. Readapt. Med. Phys. 2003; 46: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The tropism for neurons is due to the affinity of BoNT for receptors on peripheral neurons (7Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). BoNTs enter neurons via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and upon acidification of the early endosome LC is translocated into the cytosol. LCs cleave neurotransmitter vesicle fusion proteins; BoNT/A cleaves SNAP25 between residues 197 and 198, and BoNT/E cleaves SNAP25 between residues 180 and 181 (9Tonello F. Morante S. Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). BoNT/C cleaves both SNAP25 and syntaxin (10Foran P. Lawrence G.W. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), whereas the other BoNT serotypes and tetanus toxin cleave the vesicle-associated membrane protein (11Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Montecucco C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 710: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Unlike other zinc proteases, BoNTs recognize extended regions of substrate for cleavage. The basis for this extended substrate recognition and the mechanism of BoNT substrate recognition are not clear. Recently, the structure of a mutated LC/A complexed with a truncated form of SNAP25 was solved (12Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The complex structure provided insight into substrate recognition distanced from the active site, providing a model for exosite recognition of SNAP25 by LC/A, but had limited information on interactions between SNAP25 and the LC/A active site presumably due to structural perturbations caused by the mutations within LC/A that inactivated catalytic activity. The recently solved co-crystal structure of LC/A and l-Arg hydroxamate (l-ArgHX) provided an experimental starting point for functional mapping of the active site domain of LC/A (13Fu Z. Chen S. Baldwin M.R. Boldt G.E. Crawford A. Janda K.D. Barbieri J.T. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8903-8911Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), where a model for the orientation of the P1 and P1′-residues (Gln197-Arg198) of SNAP25 within the active site of LC/A was presented. Earlier studies identified two regions within SNAP25 that comprised an active site (AS) region that represented the site of cleavage and a binding (B) region that conferred high affinity substrate binding. Within the AS region, P4′, P1′, P3, and P5 residues of SNAP25 were shown to contribute to scissile bond cleavage by LC/A (14Chen S. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10906-10911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These findings prompted the present study to define how LC/A recognizes and cleaves SNAP25. BoNT LC/A was constructed by amplifying DNA encoding LC/A-(1–425) of C. botulinum serotype A1 Hall strain and subcloning into pET-15b. Plasmids encoding LCs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) RIL (Stratagene). Protein expression was achieved by culturing E. coli with 0.75 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as previously described (15Baldwin M.R. Bradshaw M. Johnson E.A. Barbieri J.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). SNAP25-(141–206) was expressed and purified as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in E. coli TG1 (14Chen S. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10906-10911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of LC/A or SNAP25 were performed using QuikChange (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instruction. Plasmids were sequenced to confirm the mutation. Linear Velocity Reaction—Reactions (10 μl) performed were as follows. 5 μm SNAP25 was incubated with the indicated concentrations of LC/A or LC/A derivatives in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, with 20 mm NaCl. Reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of SNAP25 cleavage was determined by densitometry. Time Course Assay—5 μm SNAP25 was incubated with 2 nm wild type LC/A or LC/A derivatives. Aliquots were withdrawn at specified times and processed as described above. Kinetic Parameters—Km and kcat determinations were performed for WT-LC/A and LC/A derivatives using SNAP25 as substrate. LC concentrations were adjusted to cleave <10% substrate at several concentrations of substrate ranging from 3 to 24 μm. The reaction was carried out in 10 μl of toxin reaction buffer, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and stopped by adding 10 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer. The cleaved products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of cleaved product was calculated by densitometry. Reaction velocity versus substrate concentration was fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and kinetic constants were derived from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using the SigmaPlot program (Chicago, IL). Mutation Complementation Assay—5 μm wild type SNAP25, SNAP(D193A), SNAP(R198A), or SNAP(I171A) were incubated with WT-LC/A (0.1–10 nm) or LC/A derivatives (0.01–10 μm). Reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and the amount of SNAP25 cleaved was determined by densitometry. The concentrations of WT-LC/A or LC/A derivatives that cleaved 50% of SNAP25 derivatives were calculated. l-Arginine Hydroxamate Inhibition of LC/A Cleavage of SNAP25—WT-LC/A or LC/A derivatives, at concentrations that cleaved ∼50% SNAP25-(141–206) in a linear velocity reaction, were incubated with 10, 1, or 0.1 mm ArgHX for 30 min on ice, followed by the addition of 5 μm SNAP25-(141–206). The reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE to determine the amount of SNAP25 cleaved. 5 μm WT-LC/A or LC/A derivative was incubated with 0.1 μm trypsin. The reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained to visualize the partial tryptic digestion. Mutations within LC/A had identical trypsin digestion profiles as WT-LC/A (Fig. 1), which indicated that these single mutations in LC/A had limited effects on the overall structural configuration of LC/A. GST pulldown assay (100-μl reaction) was performed by preincubating 3 μm GST-SNAP25(R198E) with 2 and 5 μm LC/A WT or LC/A(D370A, L175A) and then adding 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads, preblocked in 10% bovine serum albumin. The beads were pelleted and washed, and proteins in the pellet were detected by Western blotting using anti-LC/A and anti-GST antibody (Sigma). Molecular Modeling of the LC/A Active Site Domain—Saturation mutagenesis defined the organization and recognition of SNAP25 by LC/A, where an AS region defined substrate cleavage and a B region that was distanced from the AS defined high affinity binding by LC/A (14Chen S. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10906-10911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Analysis of molecular models predicted a series of discontiguous interactions that first aligned the B region of SNAP25 to the active site and then optimized scissile bond cleavage through a series of interactions that involve four pockets (S5, S4′, S1′, and S3) that comprise the LC/A AS (Fig. 2, A–C). An overview of this model was shown by a stereo image (Fig. 2D). Initial Interactions That Align the P5 Residue of SNAP25 to the LC/A Active Site—In the holotoxin structure, the N-terminal heavy chain (HC) loop forms a belt that wraps around the substrate binding cleft of the LC; unexpectedly, the region of the HC loop that bound LC/A aligned well with the region of SNAP25 that bound to LC/A (Fig. 3A). This prompted a comparison of SNAP25 and the HC loop of BoNT/A that revealed spatial and sequence homology between the two proteins. The alignment extended along a stretch of 38 amino acids of SNAP25 that abruptly ended at the P5 residue (Fig. 3, A and B). The residues that played an important role in substrate binding and recognition in SNAP25 with LC/A aligned with HC loop residues that interacted with LC/A (Fig. 3B). This suggested that the initial recognition of SNAP25 with LC/A was mimicking the binding of the HC loop within the binding cleft of LC/A in the native holotoxin. The biological function of the HC loop in BoNT/A may be as a pseudo-substrate that blocks the active site of LC/A to prevent auto-cleavage (16Ahmed S.A. Byrne M.P. Jensen M. Hines H.B. Brueggemann E. Smith L.A. J. Protein Chem. 2001; 20: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Analysis of the LC/A and SNAP25 complex structure revealed that LC/A residues Ile115, Lys41, Cys134, and Val129 directly interacted with residues within the SNAP25 B region. Ala mutations to Ile115, Lys41, Cys134, and Val129 each had a ∼4-fold increase in Km and a ∼5-fold decrease in kcat for the cleavage of SNAP25 (Table 1). Thus, the B region of SNAP25 performs a dual role as the initial site of LC/A recognition and as the first active site interaction between the P5 residue of SNAP25 and the S5 pocket of the LC/A active site. However, defining the significance of slight changes in Km as being due to direct or indirect interactions is difficult. An Eadie Hofstee plot of wild type LC/A cleavage of SNAP25 is shown in Fig. 4.TABLE 1Kinetic constants for the cleavage of SNAP25 by LC/A and LC/A derivativesLC/A site designationLC/A derivativeKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1s-1 μm-1WT16 ± 0.6603.7BindingI115A95 ± 8.5111.2 × 10-1K41A98 ± 7.4121.2 × 10-1C134A61 ± 6.8111.9 × 10-1V129A53 ± 5.6122.3 × 10-1S5R177A12 ± 4.51.19.1 × 10-2L175A11 ± 2.30.76.1 × 10-2T176A14 ± 4.51.28.5 × 10-2S4′E257A19 ± 3.31.15.4 × 10-2E257K27 ± 5.60.13.7 × 10-3S1′D370A14 ± 1.30.19.8 × 10-3D370R11 ± 0.90.021.4 × 10-3F163A12 ± 1.10.43.0 × 10-2F194A9 ± 1.20.22.2 × 10-2T220A20 ± 3.60.31.2 × 10-2Double mutationsF194A,T220A9.2 ± 1.30.192.0 × 10-2L175A,R177A8.3 ± 2.00.89.6 × 10-2ControlQ162A17 ± 1.2633.8H269A16 ± 1.1583.7 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Eadie Hofstee plot of the cleavage of SNAP25 by wild type LC/A.

Mutation of each residue to Ala reduced LC/A hydrolysis activity between 60- and 100-fold (Table 1) with a greater effect on kcat than Km. This suggested that the S5 pocket contributed to the proper alignment of the scissile bond for cleavage rather than contributing to substrate affinity. The loss of catalytic activity by S5 pocket residue mutations can be complemented by mutation of the P5 site of SNAP25, Asp193, supporting a direct role for S5 pocket residues on P5 recognition. While LC/A(L175A), LC/A(T176A), and LC/A(R177A) possessed a reduced capacity to cleave WT-SNAP25, ∼75-, ∼50-, and ∼50-fold reduction in cleavage activities, respectively, these three mutated LC/As cleaved SNAP25(D193A) at ∼3- to 5-fold lower than WT-LC/A. These results suggest that P5 Asp193 was recognized by S5 pocket residues, but this recognition may not be a direct interaction between S5 pocket residues and Asp193 where electrostatic interactions between the basic S5 pocket and negatively charged Asp193 contribute to this interaction (Table 2). The S5 pocket residues appeared specific, because mutation of other LC/A residues adjacent to the P5 residue of SNAP25, LC/A(Q162A) and LC/A(H269A), did not affect hydrolytic activity (Table 1). Interactions between the S5 pocket of LC/A and P5 residue of SNAP25 orient the next step in SNAP25 recognition, the binding of the P4′ residue of SNAP25 to the LC/A active site.TABLE 2Cleavage of SNAP25, SNAP25(D193A), and SNAP25(I173A) by LC/A and LC/A S5 pocket derivativesLC/A50% cleavage of SNAP25WT/LC/A derivative50% cleavage of SNAP25(D193A)WT/LC/A derivative50% SNAP25(I171A)WT/LC/A derivativeμmμmμmWT0.00310.410.81L175A0.2752.05>10NDaND, not determined.T176A0.15501.33>10NDR177A0.15501.23>10NDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Recognition of the P4′-Residue of SNAP25 by the S4′-Pocket Residue of LC/A—The loop250 of LC/A (residues 242–259) was initially identified as the site of auto-cleavage (17Segelke B. Knapp M. Kadkhodayan S. Balhorn R. Rupp B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6888-6893Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and subsequently observed to pack next to LC/A loop370 (residues 359–370) when LC/A bound SNAP25 (12Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Whereas earlier studies proposed that the loop250 residue Met202 represented the primary contact of SNAP25 to LC/A, subsequent analyses showed that mutations of SNAP25-Met202 had a limited effect on catalysis (12Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) but that mutations at SNAP25-Lys201 yielded poor substrates for cleavage by LC/A (14Chen S. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10906-10911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Examination of the LC/A-SNAP25 structure showed a potential salt bridge between SNAP25-Lys201 and LC/A-Glu257 (Fig. 2B). Supporting a role of Glu257 in SNAP25 recognition/cleavage was the determination that mutations at Glu257 had a 60- to 600-fold slower rate of SNAP25 cleavage, reflected in a lower kcat, than WT-LC/A (Table 1). Sequential binding at the S5 and S4′-sites aligns SNAP25 within the active site such that the P1′-residue of SNAP25, Arg198, initiates interactions with the S1′-pocket of LC/A. Recognition of the P1′-Site Residue of SNAP25 by S1′-Pocket Residues of LC/A—LC/A-Asp370 forms a salt bridge with the inhibitor l-ArgHX (13Fu Z. Chen S. Baldwin M.R. Boldt G.E. Crawford A. Janda K.D. Barbieri J.T. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8903-8911Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Examination of the structure of LC/A and l-ArgHX identified an additional LC/A residue that contacted the inhibitor Phe163 and several residues that aligned near the inhibitor, including Phe194 and Thr220. LC/A-D370A or the charge reversal mutation, LC/A-D370R, reduced the ability of LC/A to cleave SNAP25 by ∼600- and 3000-fold, respectively (Table 1), whereas replacement of LC/A-Phe163, LC/A-Phe194, or LC/A-Thr220 with Ala each reduced kcat by ∼100-fold without influencing the Km of LC/A for SNAP25. Thus, in addition to a salt bridge of the guanidinium group of Arg198 with the S1′-pocket residue, Asp370, there appear to be hydrophobic interactions between the aliphatic portion of the side chain of Arg198 and the hydrophobic S1′-pocket residues, in particular Phe194 (Fig. 2C). A direct role of Asp370 and Phe194 on substrate recognition was supported by the catalytic complementation of LC/A(Asp370) and LC/A(Phe194) by P1′-SNAP25 mutations. Whereas LC/A(D370A) and LC/A(F194A) cleaved WT-SNAP25 less efficiently than WT-LC/A, both mutated proteins cleaved the P1′-mutated SNAP25(R198A) at similar rates as WT-LC/A (Table 3).TABLE 3Cleavage of SNAP25 and SNAP25(R198A) by LC/A and LC/A S1′-pocket derivativesLC/A50% cleavage of SNAP2WT/LC/A derivative50% cleavage of SNAP25(R198A)WT/LC/A derivativeμmμmWT0.00312.51D370R7.525001.50.6D370A1.55001.50.6F194A0.752502.51T220A0.6200>10NDaND, not determined.F163A0.45150>10NDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The role of S1′-pocket residues on P1′-residue recognition was also supported by the change in sensitivity of S1′-pocket mutated LC/A to inhibition by l-ArgHX, an inhibitor of LC/A (18Boldt G.E. Kennedy J.P. Hixon M.S. McAllister L.A. Barbieri J.T. Tzipori S. Janda K.D. J. Comb Chem. 2006; 8: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Examination of the structure of the LC/A·l-ArgHX complex showed that the carbonyl- and N-hydroxyl groups of l-ArgHX formed a bidentate ligand with the zinc ion and the guanidinium group of the Arg side chain formed a salt bridge with the carbonyl R group of Asp370, suggesting that the inhibitor-bound structure mimicked a catalytic intermediate for the P1′-residue Arg198 at the active site. The ability of l-ArgHX to inhibit catalysis by mutations in LC/A was used to probe the S1′-pocket. The residual hydrolytic activity of LC/A(D370A) and LC/A(D370R) for SNAP25 (Fig. 3) was not inhibited by 10 mm l-ArgHX. LC/A(F163A), LC/A (F194A), and LC/A(T220A) were also less sensitive to l-ArgHX inhibition than WT-LC/A and were only partially inhibited at 10 mm l-ArgHX (Fig. 5), which supported their role in P1′-residue interactions. In contrast, LC/A possessing mutations in S4′- and S5 pocket residues remained sensitive to the inhibition by l-ArgHX. Substrate recognition by the S1′-residue has been proposed based upon characterization of BoNT-SNARE interactions (14Chen S. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol.

Within the active site, zinc is coordinated by the HEXXH motif, and a conserved Glu and a conserved Arg and Tyr lie in close proximity to the scissile peptide bond. However, conservation of amino acids within the active site domain is not extended to the S1′-pocket, which is consistent with the diverse chemical nature of P1′-residues of the substrates of various BoNT serotypes. Overall, S1′-pocket residues correlated in size and hydrophobicity with the cognate P1′-residue. In LC/A, each of the four residues that form the S1′-pocket appear to play different roles in substrate recognition. Asp370 is located underneath the S1′-pocket and forms a salt bridge with the guanidinium group of Arg198, whereas Phe194, Phe163, and Thr220 have hydrophobic interactions with the aliphatic chain of the Arg198 side chain. S1′-pocket residue recognition appears to be the primary mechanism of substrate recognition in LC/A and other neurotoxins (14Chen S. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10906-10911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Sikorra S. Henke T. Swaminathan S. Galli T. Binz T. J. Mol.

Alignment of P3 Residue of SNAP25 to the S3 Pocket Residues of LC/A—Mutation of the P3 residue of SNAP25(A195S) had a 1000-fold reduction in hydrolysis relative to the cleavage of WT-SNAP25 by LC/A (14Chen S. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10906-10911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Examination of the co-crystal structure of SNAP25 and LC/A revealed that the methyl side chain on Ala195 tightly fits into a pocket within LC/A (the S3 pocket) without enough space for the –OH of serine (12Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Because of spatial constraints of the S3 pocket main chain interactions there were no conserved substitutions that were predicted to maintain the cavity of the S3 pocket, which discouraged subsequent manipulation of this site. The role of the S3 pocket residues of LC/A in the substrate recognition involves the alignment of the P3 residue of SNAP25, Ala195, to the S3 pocket of LC/A, which sets up an optimal orientation for the interactions of the P1′-residue of SNAP25, Arg198, to Asp370 and Phe194 of LC/A, resulting in the precise alignment of the scissile bond in the active site. Effect of Double Pocket Mutations on SNAP25 Cleavage by LC/A—The functional relationships between residues within a single pocket or different pockets were assessed to test the predicted organization of LC/A for substrate recognition. The double pocket mutations LC/A(Leu175, Asp370) and LC/A(Leu175, Phe194) showed only residual capacity to cleave SNAP25 (reductions in specific activity were >40,000-fold), whereas double mutations within a single predicted pocket, LC/A(Phe194, Thr220) and LC/A(Leu175, Lys177), cleaved SNAP25 at rates similar to the respective individual mutations at these residues. GST pulldown experiments showed that LC/A(L175A,D370A) and LC/A(L175A,F194A) had similar affinity for SNAP25(R198E), a non-cleavable form of SNAP25, as WT LC/A (Fig. 6), supporting that the roles for these residues are in catalytic action, not in substrate binding. LC/A(F194A,T220A) and LC/A(L175A,K177A) had reduced kcat for SNAP25 cleavage as observed for individual pocket mutations (Table 1). Experiments were conducted at concentrations of LC/A and SNAP25 to yield a dose response for the amount of wild type LC/A in the pulldown (data not shown). Together, the data indicated that mutation of residues that lay in different pockets caused synergistic reduction in catalysis, whereas mutation of residues located within a single pocket had reduced catalytic activity that was similar to individual mutations within the respective pockets. Although the precise mechanism for peptide bond cleavage by the BoNTs remains to be resolved, cleavage of the scissile peptide bond appears to follow a general base-catalyzed mechanism. Arg362 and Tyr365 interact with the carbonyl oxygens of the P1 and P1′-residues of SNAP25, respectively, and stabilize the oxyanion in the transition state (30Binz T. Bade S. Rummel A. Kollewe A. Alves J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1717-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Agarwal R. Binz T. Swaminathan S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8291-8302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Peptide bond cleavage is initiated by a water molecule that is polarized by the Glu within the zinc binding motif (HEXXH) and Zn2+, which causes a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond to form an oxyanion. Peptide bond cleavage is likely achieved by a proton transfer from the attacking water mediated by the carboxyl group of the downstream Glu to form a protonated amine. Rate of catalysis will be affected by the relative contribution of particular residues in the docking and stabilization of substrate to the active site cavity. Upon substrate cleavage, the P4′-residue-S4′-residue interaction is disrupted, which initiates the dissociation of the C-terminal product of SNAP25 from LC/A (32Parpura V. Chapman E.R. Croat. Med. J. 2005; 46: 491-497PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dong M. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14701-14706Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Upon dissociation of the P4′-residue the AS returns to the original conformation that has a lower affinity for the P1′-residue, facilitating the dissociation of the C-terminal product of SNAP25 from LC/A. The N-terminal product of LC/A cleavage can associate with syntaxins, which yields unproductive syntaxin·SNAP-25 complexes that impede vesicle exocytosis, resulting in BoNT/A poisoning (34Tucker W.C. Weber T. Chapman E.R. Science. 2004; 304: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 35Bajohrs M. Rickman C. Binz T. Davletov B.

The current study provides a molecular mechanism of LC/A recognition and cleavage of SNAP25 that involves sequential steps representing SNAP25 recognition and active site organization (Fig. 7). Initial interactions involve discontiguous surfaces between residues within the belt region of LC/A and the B region residues of SNAP25. The Velcro-like binding of SNAP25 to LC/A aligns the P5 residue Asp193 to form a salt bridge with Arg177, an S5 pocket residue at the periphery of one side of the active site. Although the exact order of each step of recognition of SNAP25 by BoNT/A at the active site is not clear, the initial binding could subsequently orient SNAP25 for the formation of a salt bridge between the P4′-residue SNAP25(Lys201) and the S4′-residue LC/A(Asp257). These interactions (12Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) broaden the LC/A active site cavity and dock Arg198, the P1′-residue, via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions within the S1′-pocket. The fine tuning of the alignment of Arg198 into the S1′-pocket resulting in the precise alignment of the scissile bond is facilitated by the binding of the P3 residue, SNAP25-Ala195, into the hydrophobic S3 pocket of LC/A. The proper docking of the P1′-P1 sites into the AS initiates substrate cleavage. After cleavage, the P4′-residue dissociates from the S4′-residue of LC/A, which converts the AS to a smaller conformation, facilitating dissociation of the P1′-residue from the AS. Understanding the mechanism of substrate recognition may provide insight into the development of serotype-specific inhibitors against botulism. In addition, BoNT is the most widely utilized protein for human therapy (37Ascher B. Rossi B. Ann. Chir. Plast. Esthet. 2004; 49: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) for numerous neurological disorders from migraines to muscle trauma to physical disabilities (38Klein A.W. Dermatol. Clin. 2004; 22 (vii): 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). BoNT serotype A is used in these therapies, based upon the ability to produce relatively pure amounts of the holotoxin and the longevity of LC action in neurons (39Bhidayasiri R. Truong D.D. J.

Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2001; 13: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the substrate specificity of LC/A should also provide insight into the modification of BoNT to optimize therapeutic potential. We acknowledge Michael R.

https://openalex.org/W1977721242,"Data relating to the structural basis of ligand recognition by integrins are limited. Here we describe the physical requirements for high affinity binding of ligands to αvβ6. By combining a series of structural analyses with functional testing, we show that 20-mer peptide ligands, derived from high affinity ligands of αvβ6 (foot-and-mouth-disease virus, latency associated peptide), have a common structure comprising an Arg-Gly-Asp motif at the tip of a hairpin turn followed immediately by a C-terminal helix. This arrangement allows two conserved Leu/Ile residues at Asp+1 and Asp+4 to be presented on the outside face of the helix enabling a potential hydrophobic interaction with the αvβ6 integrin, in addition to the Arg-Gly-Asp interaction. The extent of the helix determines peptide affinity for αvβ6 and potency as an αvβ6 antagonist. A major role of this C-terminal helix is likely to be the correct positioning of the Asp+1 and Asp+4 residues. These data suggest an explanation for several biological functions of αvβ6 and provide a structural platform for design of αvβ6 antagonists."

To determine whether NEMO and IKKα can form a functional IKK complex capable of activating the classical NF-κB pathway in the absence of IKKβ, we utilized a panel of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking each of the IKK complex subunits. This confirmed that TNF-induced IκBα degradation absolutely requires NEMO and IKKβ. In contrast, we consistently observed intact IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation in response to IL-1 in two separate cell lines lacking IKKβ. Furthermore, exogenously expressed, catalytically inactive IKKβ blocked TNF- but not IL-1-induced IκBα degradation in wild-type MEFs, and reconstitution of IKKα/β double knockout cells with IKKα rescued IL-1- but not TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Finally, we have shown that incubation of IKKβ-deficient MEFs with a cell-permeable peptide that blocks the interaction of NEMO with the IKKs inhibits IL-1-induced NF-κB activation.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family consists of five members named p50 and p52 (the NH2-terminal fragments of the longer NF-κB1/p105 and NF-κB2/p100 proteins respectively), p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and RelB. These proteins homo- or heterodimerize to form either transcriptionally active (e.g. p50: p65) or repressive (e.g. p50:p50) NF-κB dimers (1Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, 2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). NF-κBis maintained inactive in the cytosol of resting cells by members of the IκB family of inhibitory proteins that include IκBα,IκBβ, IκBϵ, and the COOH termini of p105 and p100. In response to a wide range of stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF and IL-1), bacterial products (e.g. lipopolysaccharide (LPS), CpG DNA), and the engagement of antigen receptors on T- and B-lymphocytes, IκB proteins are rapidly phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded by the 26 S proteasome, thereby enabling NF-κB dimers to localize to the nucleus and regulate target gene transcription (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Signal-induced IκB phosphorylation is mediated by the high molecular weight IκB kinase (IKK) complex that contains two catalytic subunits named IKKα (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2) and a non-catalytic regulatory subunit named NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) or IKKγ (3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ share significant structural identity, and each contains an NH2-terminal catalytic domain, a central leucine zipper motif through which they heterodimerize, and a COOH-terminal helix-loop-helix domain (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). IKKβ also contains a novel ubiquitin-like domain, although the function of this region is not yet known (4May M.J. Larsen S.E. Shim J.H. Madge L.A. Ghosh S. J. Biol.

We have previously demonstrated that identical hexapeptide sequences (i.e. Leu-Asp-Trp-Ser-Trp-Leu) within the extreme COOH termini of both IKKα and IKKβ facilitate their association with NEMO, and we named this region the NEMO binding domain (NBD) (5May M.J.

Despite their significant similarities, IKKα and IKKβ play distinct roles within the overall NF-κB signaling paradigm (1Bonizzi G. Karin M.

In this regard, rapid and transient TNF-induced IκBα degradation occurs through a pathway that depends upon IKKβ and NEMO (1Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). This was definitively established in mice lacking either of these subunits that die during development from massive TNF-induced hepatocyte apoptosis due to the inability to mount an NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic response (8Li Q.

This “classical” NF-κB signaling pathway is now defined as NEMO- and IKKβ-dependent IκB phosphorylation and degradation liberating canonical NF-κB complexes typified by the ubiquitous p50:p65 heterodimer. All stimuli that induce IκBα degradation, including IL-1, LPS, and antigen-receptor engagement, are considered to be activators of the NEMO- and IKKβ-dependent classical NF-κB pathway (1Bonizzi G.

These complexes regulate several genes encoding lymphoid chemokines (i.e. CCL19, CCL21, CXCL12, and CXCL13) and BAFF (13Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M.

This pathway is termed the “non-canonical” or “alternative” NF-κB pathway, and studies using IKKβ- and NEMO-deficient cells have demonstrated that it functions in the absence of each of these IKK complex subunits (1Bonizzi G.

Furthermore, classical NF-κB activation in response to TNF occurs in the absence of IKKα, suggesting that the interaction of IKKα with NEMO plays no role in regulating this pathway (13Dejardin E.

We therefore sought to determine whether the ability of IKKα to interact with NEMO via its NBD plays any functional role in classical NF-κB signaling. To address this question, we examined IκBα degradation induced by TNF and IL-1 in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking each of the IKK complex subunits. Remarkably we found that, although TNF-induced IκBα degradation was absolutely dependent upon NEMO and IKKβ, IL-1-induced degradation and classical NF-κB activation remained intact in cells lacking IKKβ. Furthermore, IL-1-induced NF-κB was blocked by the cell-permeable NBD peptide in IKKβ–/– MEFs, demonstrating that an IKK complex consisting of only IKKα and NEMO is sufficient for IL-1- but not TNF-induced classical NF-κB activation. Our findings therefore identify differences in the absolute requirements for the separate IKK subunits activated in a NEMO-dependent manner by distinct upstream stimuli.

Protein G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against either rabbit or mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, (West Grove, PA). Murine anti-lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR; AC.H6) (catalog number 552939) was from BD Biosciences. Wild-type (WT), IKKα–/–, and IKKβ–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts were generously provided by Dr. Inder Verma (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA; MEFs 1), who also provided the IKKα/β double-deficient cells, and Dr. Michael Karin (University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA; MEFs 2) who also provided the NEMO-deficient MEFs. Plat-E cells were cultured and used as previously described (21Orange J.S. Harris K.E. Andzelm M.M. Valter M.M. Geha R.S. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14151-14156Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50μg/ml). For all experiments, unless otherwise indicated, cells were cultured in either 6-well tissue culture trays or 100-mm dishes and were stimulated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) or TNF (10 ng/ml) when they reached 80% confluence. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of TNT lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) and a complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Samples were then scraped and harvested into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, vortexed for 30 s, and then centrifuged (425 × g for 10 min). Protein levels in the supernatants were determined using a Coomassie protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and 20 μg of protein from each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Milford, MA) and immunoblotted with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection of the bound antibody by enhanced chemiluminescence was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). For immunoprecipitations, cell extracts were incubated with 2 μg of primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation (1 h at 4 °C) with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (50% slurry). A portion of each sample preimmunoprecipitation (5%) was retained for analysis. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and then the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) followed by immunoblotting as described above. Densitometry—Densitometry was performed using a GelDoc EQ gel documentation system and the QuantityOne software package (Bio-Rad). Pixel intensity was measured in identical rectangular volumes around each band on immunoblots, and a background value in an equal rectangular volume separate from the bands was subtracted to obtain the mean pixel intensity/mm2. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed paired Student's t test. Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Assays—WT, IKKα–/–, IKKβ–/–, and NEMO-deficient MEFs grown in 12-well plates (2.5 × 105/well) were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected with a total of 1.0 μg of DNA/well consisting of the NF-κB-dependent firefly luciferase reporter construct pBIIx-firefly luciferase (0.2 μg/well) and a β-actin promoter Renilla luciferase reporter (0.02 μg/well) together with either control vector alone or the test DNA. Cells were stimulated with IL-1 for 5 h and then lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) 24–36 h after transfection. Samples were assayed using a Luminoscan 96-well automated luminometer (Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, MA), and FF:RL ratios were calculated using Ascent software (Thermo LabSystems). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—MEFs were stimulated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for the appropriate times and then scraped into phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and pelleted (425 g, 10 min). Pellets were resuspended and swollen for 30 min on ice in 100 μl of NarA buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and complete miniprotease inhibitors), incubated a further 5 min on ice in 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and then vortexed and centrifuged (3800 × g) for 1 min. Supernatants (cytoplasmic fraction) were centrifuged (20,000 × g) for 1 h at 4°C, and the resulting supernatants were snap frozen and retained for analysis. Pelleted nuclei were washed once with 100 μl of NarA buffer before being vortexed in 30 μl of NarC buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and complete miniprotease inhibitors) for 1 h at 4 °C. Nuclear lysates were then centrifuged for 20 min (20,000 × g) at room temperature and then either used immediately or snap frozen and stored at –80 °C. Single-stranded complimentary oligonucleotides encompassing a consensus NF-κB site (upper strand, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) or the Oct-1 probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were annealed and then labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The labeled probe was purified using mini-Quick Spin columns (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For EMSA, 2–5 μg of nuclear extracts supplemented with 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Roche Applied Science) were incubated with an equal volume of 2× binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) on ice for 10 min. After incubation, 1 μl of labeled probe was added, and then samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The resulting DNA·NF-κB complexes were separated on 5% polyacrylamide non-denaturing gels by electrophoresis, and then gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Supershift analysis was performed following the same protocol, except that samples were incubated with antibodies (anti-p65 or anti-p50) for 2 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of labeled probe. NBD Peptides—Small scale Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) synthesis of the peptides was carried out on a Rainin Symphony instrument (Rainin Instruments, LLC, Oakland, CA) at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer-Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (New Haven, CT). Peptides were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and analytical reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Immediately prior to use, the peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a stock of 50 mm. The sequences of the wild-type and mutant NBD peptides have been described previously (5May M.J.

The NBD peptide contains the region of IKKβ from T735 to E745 synthesized in tandem with a membrane permeabilization sequence from the Drosophila antennapedia homeodomain protein. The mutant peptide is identical, except that Trp-739 and -741 are replaced by alanines to render it biologically inactive (5May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S.

Preparation of Stable Cell Lines—All cloning procedures were performed by PCR using cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A cDNA encoding IKKβ (K44M) was subcloned into the HindIII and NotI sites of LZRS-pBMN-lacZ retroviral vector (kindly provided by Garry Nolan, Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Resulting LZRS–IKKβ(K44M) was transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 into Plat-E cells and selected for gene expression 24 h after transfection using puromycin (1 μg/ml). Puromycin-resistant cells were used to derive conditioned medium to provide a retroviral stock for MEF transduction. For cell transduction, MEFs were washed and incubated for 8 h with a retrovirus-conditioned medium containing Polybrene (8 μg/ml, Sigma). After incubation, the retrovirus was removed and replaced with normal growth medium. The transduction process was repeated a further three times until the cells became >90% GFP-positive as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis using Cell Quest software (FACSort, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). To generate double knock-out (DKO) MEFs stably transduced with IKKα, full-length IKKα cDNA was cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the EcoRI restriction site of retroviral GFP-MIGR1 vector (kindly provided by Dr. Warren Pear, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The resulting MIG–IKKα was transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 into Plat-E cells to produce ecotropic virus that was derived from conditioned medium containing Polybrene (8 μg/ml). For cell sorting, transduced cells were trypsinized and washed in FACS buffer (sterile phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Evaluation of GFP was performed on a three-laser (argon (488 nm), krypton (407 nm), and dye laser (tuned to 600 nm)), 10-parameter FACSVantage™ cell sorter from BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems. Compensation and data analyses were performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). IL-1 (but Not TNF or LPS) Induces IκBα Degradation in the Absence of IKKβ—To identify the components of the IKK complex required for classical NF-κB activation in response to distinct stimuli, we compared TNF, IL-1, and LPS signaling in wild-type (WT), IKKα–/–, IKKβ–/–, and NEMO-deficient MEFs. The phenotype of each MEF line was verified by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A) and confirmed for each experiment performed. As described previously (13Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), incubation with TNF led to rapid degradation of IκBα that returned to basal levels within 60 min in both WT and IKKα–/– MEFs (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4 and 9–11). In contrast, IκBα levels remained constant in NEMO-deficient and IKKβ–/– MEFs (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8 and 13–16), confirming that TNF-induced classical NF-κB activation requires both IKKβ and NEMO and occurs in the absence of IKKα (8Li Q.

Similarly, IL-1-induced IκBα degradation was intact in WT and IKKα–/– MEFs but not in NEMO-deficient cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–12). To our surprise, however, IκBα was degraded and reappeared in IL-1-stimulated IKKβ–/– MEFs (Fig. 1C, lanes 13–16) with similar kinetics to WT cells. Furthermore, IL-1 stimulation rapidly induced IκBα phosphorylation at the critical serine residues (Ser-32 and -36) required to trigger its degradation by the proteasome in both WT (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 2) and IKKβ–/– cells (compare lanes 5 and 6). Densitometric analysis of data from eleven separate time course experiments confirmed that IL-1 (but not TNF) consistently induced IκBα degradation in MEFs lacking IKKβ (Fig. 1E, white bars). Significant differences between WT and IKKβ–/– cells were only observed at the 15- and 30-min time points in the TNF-treated samples (60 min of TNF, p = 0.17) (indicated on Fig. 1D). No significant differences were observed between WT and IKKβ–/– MEFs treated with IL-1 for any time point tested (15 min, p = 0.17; 30 min, p = 0.42; 60 min, p = 0.91). Collectively therefore, the data in panels C-E of Fig. 1 demonstrate that IL-1 induces the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα in cells lacking IKKβ with similar kinetics to that in WT cells. Activation of the classical NF-κB pathway by LPS occurs via ligation of the Toll-like receptor TLR4 (22Kawai T. Akira S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). As some of the signaling intermediates downstream of TLR4 are shared with the IL-1 signaling pathway (i.e. MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6), we questioned whether LPS could also activate classical NF-κB signaling in cells lacking IKKβ. As shown in Fig. 1F, L"
https://openalex.org/W2068547049,"Homeoproteins are a class of transcription factors defined by the structure of their DNA-binding domain, the homeodomain. In addition to their nuclear cell-autonomous activities, homeoproteins transfer between cells, thanks to two separate steps of secretion and internalization, which both rely on unconventional mechanisms. Internalization is driven by the third helix of the homeodomain (Penetratin) through a non-vesicular and endocytosis-independent mechanism. In contrast, homeoprotein secretion involves vesicular compartments and requires the presence of a sequence of 11 amino acids (Sec sequence) spanning between the second and third helix of the homeodomain. In this study, we report that the SecPen polypeptide, which combines the two identified domains, Penetratin and Sec, bears all of the necessary information to go in and out of cells. We have analyzed key mechanisms and demonstrated that this peptide can efficiently cross a tight junction epithelium.

We have analyzed key mechanisms and demonstrated that this peptide can efficiently cross a tight junction epithelium. Homeoproteins belong to a class of transcription factors with key developmental and adult functions. In addition to their nuclear cell-autonomous activities, they also have the ability to transfer between cells (1Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). The latter property likely serves specific paracrine functions. For example, the extracellular application of a gradient of Engrailed homeoprotein attracts or repulses the nasal or temporal growth cones of retinal ganglion cells, respectively, suggesting a non-cell autonomous function of Engrailed in axonal guidance (2Brunet I. Weinl C. Piper M. Trembleau A. Volovitch M. Harris W. Prochiantz A. Holt C. Nature. 2005; 438: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Homeoprotein intercellular transfer involves two separate steps of secretion and internalization. The homeodomain (the DNA-binding domain that defines homeoproteins) is necessary and sufficient for transfer (3Tassetto M. Maizel A. Osorio J. Joliot A. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), even though other parts of the protein are endowed with transfer regulatory functions (4Maizel A. Tassetto M. Filhol O. Cochet C. Prochiantz A. Joliot A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two sequences required for secretion and internalization are highly conserved, and indeed, intercellular transfer is a shared property of several homeoproteins. Mutational analysis indicates that internalization and secretion rely on two distinct mechanisms (5Joliot A. Maizel A. Rosenberg D. Trembleau A. Dupas S. Volovitch M. Prochiantz A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 856-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Internalization is driven by the third helix of the homeodomain (6Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) and has been used extensively to address exogenous compounds into the cell cytoplasm and nucleus (see Ref. 8Dupont E. Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Langel U. Cell-penetrating Peptides. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2002: 23-51Google Scholar for review). Homeoproteins are also secreted despite the absence of classical secretion signals. Using Engrailed-1 (En1) and Engrailed-2 (En2) as prototypic homeoproteins, it was shown that they are present in vivo in vesicles enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (9Joliot A. Trembleau A. Raposo G. Calvet S. Volovitch M. Prochiantz A. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addressing of Engrailed proteins to this compartment and their secretion are abolished upon deletion of 11 amino acids spanning between the second and third helix of the homeodomain (5Joliot A. Maizel A. Rosenberg D. Trembleau A. Dupas S. Volovitch M. Prochiantz A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 856-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Maizel A. Bensaude O. Prochiantz A. Joliot A. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3183-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was called the Sec sequence (see Fig. 3A). It thus suggests that this sequence participates in unconventional homeoprotein secretion (in the absence of secretion signal sequence).In this study, we have addressed the question of the minimal sequence required for internalization and secretion. The Sec sequence, partially overlapped with Penetratin within the Engrailed homeodomain, and we investigated whether SecPen, a 27-amino-acid-long peptide that combines Penetratin and the Sec sequences, bears all of the necessary information to go in and out of cells. We demonstrated that this SecPen peptide efficiently crosses a tight junction epithelium and analyzed some key steps involved. This study provides a good starting point to develop agents capable of crossing such epithelia in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis—Biotinylated peptides were synthesized by Neosystem (France) with a biotin residue at the N terminus using the following sequences: Pen (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK), PenPro (RQPKIWFPNRRMPWKK), Tat (GRKKRRQRRRP), SecPen (QSLAQELGLNERQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK), and SecTat (QSLAQELGLNERQIKIGRKKRRQRRRP). N-terminally carboxyfluorescein-labeled peptides were a generous gift of B. Christiaens.Cell Cultures—MDCK I cells (high resistance) were maintained in DMEM:F-12 (1:1) with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. For peptide internalization, cells were plated on glass coverslips (2.5 × 104 cells/cm2) and cultured for 24 h. For Transwell studies, cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells on a 12-mm polystyrene Transwell filter (0.4 μm pore size, Costar) and cultured for at least 5–6 days until full differentiation was achieved (electrical resistance > 2000 Ω/cm2).Peptide Internalization—Carboxy-fluorescein labeled peptides (20 μm,25 μl) were incubated with MDCK cells in fresh serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium at the indicated times and temperatures in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm Sytox orange (Molecular Probes). Cells were then washed five times with cold medium and processed for confocal microscopy (TCS-SP2, Leica). When indicated, the cells were briefly washed with cold medium and either immersed in a solution of 0.8% (w/v) trypan blue in culture medium or treated with a solution of 0.05% trypsin/0.02% EDTA (5 min, 4 °C) diluted in cold culture medium. Trypsin digestion was inhibited by the addition of fetal calf serum. Cells were then processed for confocal microscopy.Biotin-labeled peptides (20 μm) were incubated with MDCK cells in 25 μl of fresh serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium at the indicated times and temperatures in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm Sytox orange (Molecular Probes). The cells were then washed five times with cold medium and incubated with unlabeled avidin (10 μm) for 10 min at 4 °C before fixation. For peptide internalization by MDCK monolayers, biotinylated peptides (100 μm solution in 500 μl of DMEM:F-12) were added in the basolateral chamber of the Transwell. Following incubation, filters were extensively washed with cold medium and incubated with avidin (10 μm in fresh DMEM:F-12) for 10 min at 4 °C before temperature shift.Biotinylated Peptide-Avidin Complex—For internalization experiments, biotinylated peptides (20 μm) diluted in culture medium were preincubated for 15 min at 20 °C with Alexa 488 streptavidin (1 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) before addition in the culture medium. For Transwell experiments, biotinylated peptides (10 μm) diluted in culture medium were preincubated for 15 min at 20 °C with avidin (10 μm) before addition in the culture medium.Detection of Biotinylated Peptides—Cells were washed three times with cold medium and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (4 °C, 10 min) and permeabilized with 0.1% TX-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (20 °C, 5 min). Biotinylated peptides were detected with Alexa 488-Streptavidin (1 μg/ml) and mounted in DAKO fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO Cytomation). Transwell cultures were labeled with polyclonal anti-ZO-1 (2 μg/ml, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) followed by a Cy5-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (7 μg/ml) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).Peptide Transport Assays through MDCK Monolayers—Peptides diluted in DMEM:F-12 were added in the apical (10 μm, 500 μl) or basolateral (10 μm, 1 ml) chamber. The opposite chamber was filled with avidin (10 μm in DMEM:F-12) to increase peptide trapping in this compartment. When indicated, cells were pretreated 15 min at 37 °C with Brefeldin A (10 μm in DMEM:F-12) before addition of the peptides in Brefeldin A-containing medium. For temperature shift, cells were washed five times with fresh cold DMEM:F-12 medium and incubated with avidin (10 μm, 10 min, 4 °C) before temperature shift. At the end of the experiments, the medium of each chamber was collected and precipitated with 4% trichloroacetic acid. When analyzed, the cells were subjected to acid wash (20 mm NaAc, 2 m NaCl, 5 min, 4 °C) followed by five washes with fresh DMEM:F-12 medium and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. 1/1.5 × 104, 1/50, and 1/4 of donor medium, cell extracts, and recipient medium, respectively, were analyzed by Western blot.Western Blotting—Protein samples were separated on 22% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were fixed with 4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in water for 15 min and extensively washed three times for 5 min each, saturated 1 h with 4% bovine serum albumin in Tris buffer saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. Peptides were revealed with biotinylated-streptavidin peroxidase (1/2000 dilution (Amersham Biosciences)) for 15 min and ECL+ detection. Luminescence was revealed by autoradiography or analyzed and quantified with Chemismart 5000 Imager (Vilmer-Lourbat).RESULTSVisualization of Peptide Internalization—Carboxyfluorescein and biotin conjugates are widely used to monitor protein transduction domain (PTD) internalization, but the use of distinct tags can lead to conflicting results. To compare these two types of conjugates, we first checked the behavior of carboxyfluorescein-linked Penetratin (CF-Pen), because it allows direct visualization on live cells. Plasma membrane integrity was evaluated by the intracellular influx of a cell-impermeant DNA dye (Sytox orange), whereas fluorescence of cell surface-associated CF-Pen was removed by trypsin treatment or quenched by the addition of trypan blue. Following the addition of CF-Pen in the medium of MDCK cell cultures, we observed a clear fluorescent cellular staining both at 4 and 37 °C (not shown). However, co-incubation of Sytox orange together with the peptide reveals a significant intracellular staining by the DNA dye at 37 °C (Fig. 1A), which is more pronounced at 4 °C (Fig. 1B), demonstrating membrane damage. By contrast, neither Penetratin (not shown) nor biotinylated Penetratin induces Sytox orange influx at 37 °C (Fig. 1C) or 4 °C (Fig. 1D), demonstrating that the toxic effect of CF-Pen is due to the addition of the carboxyfluorescein moiety and not to Penetratin itself.FIGURE 1CF-Penetratin alters membrane integrity. CF-Pen (A and B)or biotin-Pen (C and D) were incubated with MDCK cells together with Sytox-Orange at 37 °C (A and C) or 4 °C (B and D) for 1 h. CF-Pen (but not biotin-Pen) induces a significant influx of the DNA dye at both temperatures.

Jansen R. van de Winkel J.G. Geertsma M.F. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: 25-33Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and was thus used to distinguish between extracellular and intracellular staining. The addition of trypan blue following CF-Penetratin incubation modified cellular staining dramatically. At 37 °C, the unquenched fluorescence is associated with vesicles (Fig. 2A) and at 4 °C, no signal is observed at all (Fig. 2B). In contrast, mild trypsin treatment did not significantly alter the cellular staining (not shown), demonstrating that CF-Penetratin internalization at 37 °C is by endocytosis and that live cells do not internalize this compound at 4 °C. We then used biotinylated Pen. To mask cell surface-associated biotinylated peptides, living cells were washed and incubated with an excess of unlabeled avidin that binds extracellular accessible biotin (see “Experimental Procedures”). With this protocol, Penetratin was internalized both at 37 °C (Fig. 2C) and 4 °C (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, coupling fluorescent streptavidin to the biotinylated peptide before its addition to the culture medium shifted the subcellular distribution of the complex toward vesicular structures at 37 °C (Fig. 2E) and fully inhibited its internalization at 4 °C (Fig. 2F). Based on these results, we concluded that conjugation to CF or streptavidin significantly affects the properties of Penetratin. Biotinylated conjugates were thus preferred for our study, despite the fact that their visualization requires fixation. Accordingly, in the following experiments, the indicated peptides will always refer to their biotinylated counterparts.FIGURE 2Influence of cargo conjugation on Penetratin internalization. CF-Pen (A and B), biotin-Pen (C and D), or an Alexa 488-streptavidin-Pen complex were incubated with MDCK cells at 37 °C (A, C, and E) or 4°C (B, D, and F) for 1 h. Extracellular staining was quenched by trypan blue (A and B) or by unlabeled avidin masking before fixation (C and D). In contrast with the temperature-independent internalization of biotin conjugates (C and D), Pen internalization becomes strictly dependent on endocytosis upon conjugation to CF (A and B) or avidin (E and F).

The SecPen peptide thus contains the two sequences but is smaller in size than the sum of the two sequences (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B illustrates that SecPen internalized at 37 °C is preferentially associated with vesicular structures. At 4 °C, SecPen is still internalized but shows a diffuse distribution, mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C). The difference in subcellular distributions of Pen and SecPen, in particular at 37 °C, could reflect two nonmutually exclusive situations. First, SecPen could be internalized at 37 °C through classical endocytosis and be present in endocytotic vesicles. Alternatively, it could be internalized by a non-endocytotic mechanism thanks to the Pen sequence and, once in the cytoplasm, could associate with a vesicular compartment. To test the latter hypothesis, we performed temperature shift experiments. SecPen was internalized at 4 °C, and after extracellular biotin quenching with avidin, the temperature was kept at 4 °C (Fig. 3D) or raised to 37 °C for 15 min (Fig. 3E). Following the shift, SecPen distribution changed from diffuse to punctate.Taken together, these results support the idea that part of the vesicular staining observed at 37 °C can be decomposed into two steps, an addressing to the cytosol, thanks to the Pen sequence and a shift to the vesicles thanks to the Sec sequence. Due to the inhibitory effect of Sec sequence deletion on Engrailed secretion (5Joliot A. Maizel A. Rosenberg D. Trembleau A. Dupas S. Volovitch M. Prochiantz A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 856-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Maizel A. Bensaude O. Prochiantz A. Joliot A. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3183-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we concluded that these vesicles might be involved in unconventional secretion pathways.Secretion of SecPen—Testing the secretion of SecPen following its internalization through the Penetratin pathway required a model allowing us to distinguish, in the culture medium, the non-internalized peptide from the peptide secreted following an internalization step. To that end, we used the Transwell culture system where MDCK cells grown on a porous filter are cultured until formation of a tight junction epithelium characterized by a high electrical resistance (>2000 ohms/cm2) between the basolateral and the apical sides of the monolayer.Peptide addition in the basolateral or apical compartment at a10 μm concentration did not modify the electrical resistance, ruling out a transient opening of the tight junctions (not shown). Following addition in one compartment (donor compartment), secretion was evaluated by peptide accumulation in the opposite compartment (recipient compartment) within 1 h. SecPen accumulated in cells independently of the loading compartment (Fig. 4A) but transport was observed only in the basolateral to apical direction. This result demonstrates that, following internalization, a pool of SecPen is released and that, in MDCK cells, SecPen transport is polarized. Quantitative analysis indicates that, although after 1 h, from 10 nmol of peptide added in the basolateral compartment 3.4 pmol is retrieved in the apical compartment (Fig. 4A). The secretion process, on its own, measured by the ratio between secreted and intracellular peptide is close to 25%.FIGURE 4Trans-epithelial transfer of SecPen. The transfer of SecPen (A and D), Pen (B), or PenPro (C) across an MDCK epithelium grown on Transwell filters was analyzed by Western blot as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples of the donor compartment (Donor), cell extracts (Cells) and recipient compartment (Recipient) following a 1 h incubation are shown. In contrast with Pen (B) or PenPro (C), SecPen is transferred across the epithelium (A and D). The transfer of SecPen is only observed in the basal to apical direction (A) and is inhibited at 4 °C (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The contribution of the Sec sequence to secretion was assessed by the analysis of Pen alone. Although the peptide is efficiently internalized by MDCK cells, it is never detected in the opposite compartment (Fig. 4B). To preclude an inhibitory role of nuclear retention on Pen secretion, we used the Gln → Pro variant of Pen (PenPro), which is still internalized but is retained in the cytoplasm (7Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, this variant is not secreted either.This series of experiments confirm that Pen and SecPen are internalized by a temperature-independent pathway and that the Sec sequence directs the peptide toward a secretion compartment. They also demonstrate that the SecPen sequence is sufficient for internalization and secretion and that secretion is polarized, at least in MDCK cells.SecPen Secretion Is Distinct from Internalization and Involves Addressing of the Cytosolic Peptide toward Secretion Compartments—The fact that Pen and SecPen are internalized but that only SecPen is secreted suggests that internalization and secretion obey two different mechanisms. To further verify this point, we used the temperature shift paradigm described above (Fig. 3) to dissociate internalization and secretion. SecPen was placed in the basolateral compartment either at 4 or 37 °C. After 1 h at 37 °C, SecPen is detected in the apical compartment (Fig. 4D). By contrast, no secretion occurs at 4 °C (Fig. 4D), even though SecPen internalization is not inhibited at this low temperature as shown by its detection in the cell extracts (Fig. 4D). This difference of sensitivity to low temperature demonstrates that internalization and secretion obey distinct mechanisms.Vesicular addressing of a cytosolic pool of SecPen (Fig. 3) does not formally rule out that, in parallel, SecPen internalized by endocytosis at 37 °C could also be transported across the epithelium through vesicular transcytosis. To verify this point, we took advantage of the fact that the addition of avidin to biotinylated Pen blocks its direct translocation across the membranes and directs it to the endocytosis pathway. Trans-epithelial transport of an avidin-SecPen complex was tested in the Transwell model. As shown in Fig. 5A, internalization of avidin-SecPen through endocytosis does not allow the secretion of the complex in the opposite compartment, suggesting that SecPen secretion requires its vesicular addressing from the cytosol. This hypothesis was verified by temperature shift experiments. SecPen was first internalized at 4 °C in the basolateral compartment, the remaining extracellular peptide was complexed with avidin to prevent its translocation, and temperature was raised to 37 °C. After 1 h, SecPen is recovered in the apical compartment (Fig. 5A), confirming that a Sec sequence-dependent mechanism addresses the cytosolic peptide toward apical secretion vesicles. The apical localization of these vesicles was analyzed by confocal microscopy using the same temperature shift protocol. As shown Fig. 5B, SecPen added in the basolateral compartment is detected in vesicles on apical sections of the epithelium, characterized by the apical marker Z0–1.FIGURE 5SecPen transfer is polarized and does not involve the Golgi pathway. A, avidin was either conjugated with SecPen prior to addition in the culture medium (left) or added to the donor compartment following SecPen incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in the basolateral compartment (right). Cells were further incubated 1 h at 37 °C. SecPen-avidin complex was incapable of transfer (left), but the pool of SecPen internalized at 4 °C prior to avidin addition is efficiently transferred upon temperature shift (right). B, association of SecPen (green) with apical vesicles following temperature shift. ZO-1 staining (red)is a marker of the apical position of the confocal section. C, Brefeldin A treatment does not prevent SecPen trans-epithelial transfer. D, the transfer of a SecTat peptide across an MDCK epithelium was evaluated. Tat PTD cannot substitute for Pen for trans-epithelial transfer. Scale bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next asked whether SecPen secretion in the apical compartment involves the classical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi secretion pathway. Brefeldin A, a potent inhibitor of this pathway, has no effect on SecPen transfer across the tight junction epithelium (Fig. 5C), demonstrating that secretion of SecPen is not Golgi-dependent. As the control, Brefeldin A treatment dramatically increases transferrin transcytosis (not shown), as reported by Wan et al. (12Wan J. Taub M.E. Shah D. Shen W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13446-13450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Tat Cannot Substitute for Penetratin in the Sec-Penetratin Peptide—Different classes of PTDs efficiently drive cargo conjugates from the medium into the cytosol. Among them, Tat PTD shares with Penetratin a high content in basic amino acids. We asked whether a chimeric SecTat peptide could behave as SecPen. When tested in the Transwell system, SecTat did not cross the epithelial layer (Fig. 5D). This indicates that Tat and Penetratin have distinct properties and that the transcellular property of Sec-Penetratin relies on the combined specific properties of both parts of the chimerical peptide, namely Penetratin and the Sec sequences.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that the properties of the Penetratin class of PTDs are modified by conjugation to carboxyfluorescein. CF-Pen alters membrane integrity and, as opposed to Pen, is not internalized at 4 °C but only at 37 °C and through endocytosis. Interestingly, CF conjugation to a nontranslocated variant of Penetratin (Trp-48 → Phe-48) (6Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to the Tat PTD has no effect on membrane integrity, as measured by the absence of Sytox orange uptake (not shown). This illustrates that, although equally efficient in cargo vectorization, Penetratin and Tat PTDs have distinct properties and probably use distinct entry routes into live cells. These results also clearly illustrate that the presence of a cargo conjugate, even as small as a carboxyfluorescein molecule, can dramatically interfere with PTD properties. Although this might seem anecdotal, it has important consequences on PTD studies and on the inability to predict whether a cargo will be actually internalized following its linkage to a PTD.We also demonstrated that the Sec domain, necessary for Engrailed secretion, when fused to Penetratin, is internalized by live cells and, following internalization, uses a temperature-dependent mechanism to address the chimerical peptide to vesicular compartments. We used an in vitro model of tight junction epithelium to demonstrate that SecPen is internalized at the level of apical and basolateral membranes but that, following internalization, it is only found in the apical compartment.Our study does not address the issue of peptide recycling (internalization and secretion in the same compartment), as it would require an unambiguous distinction between non-internalized and secreted peptides. We cannot thus rule out that SecPen and/or Penetratin could be secreted and internalized from the donor or the receiver compartment. This caveat must mellow our conclusions, but based on migration profiles on SDS-PAGE, it appears that up to 25% of internalized SecPen is secreted in 1 h without degradation. Quantitative analysis of SecPen transfer from ten independent experiments indicates that, following the addition of 10 nmol of peptide in the basolateral compartment, 3.3 ± 0.7 pmol of peptide are retrieved in the apical compartment after 1 h. In similar conditions, the transcytosis of transferrin is 50-fold less efficient. Previous studies on the passage of PTDs across epithelial monolayers have demonstrated that Tat and Penetratin PTDs are incapable of transcellular transport (13Zhang X. Wan L. Pooyan S. Su Y.

Understanding the interplay between GABAergic transmission and excitatory circuits in the amygdala is, therefore, critical for understanding the neurobiological basis of anxiety. Here, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to demonstrate that GluR5-containing kainate receptors regulate local inhibitory circuits, modulate the excitatory transmission from the basolateral amygdala to the central amygdala, and control behavioral anxiety. Genetic deletion of GluR5 or local injection of a GluR5 antagonist into the basolateral amygdala increases anxiety-like behavior. Activation of GluR5 selectively depolarized inhibitory neurons, thereby increasing GABA release and contributing to tonic GABA current in the basolateral amygdala. The enhanced GABAergic transmission leads to reduced excitatory inputs in the central amygdala. Our results suggest that GluR5 is a key regulator of inhibitory circuits in the amygdala and highlight the potential use of GluR5-specific drugs in the treatment of pathological anxiety."

The forkhead DNA binding domain (DBD) consists of three-helix bundle resting on a small antiparallel β-sheet from which two extended loops protrude and create two wing-like structures. The wing W2 of FoxO factors contains a 14-3-3 protein-binding motif that is phosphorylated by protein kinase B in response to insulin or growth factors. In this report, we investigated the role of the N-terminal loop (portion located upstream of first helix H1) and the C-terminal region (loop known as wing W2) of the forkhead domain of transcription factor FoxO4 in DNA binding. Although the deletion of either portion partly reduces the FoxO4-DBD binding to the DNA, the simultaneous deletion of both regions inhibits DNA binding significantly. Foörster resonance energy transfer measurements and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that both studied N- and C-terminal regions of FoxO4-DBD directly interact with DNA. In the presence of the N-terminal loop the protein kinase B-induced phosphorylation of wing W2 by itself has negligible effect on DNA binding. On the other hand, in the absence of this loop the phosphorylation of wing W2 significantly inhibits the FoxO4-DBD binding to the DNA.

Because various forkhead proteins belonging to different subgroups share almost identical folds the variations in DBD topology cannot explain distinct DNA-binding specificities.

The PKB phosphorylation site and the 14-3-3 protein-binding motif are located in the basic region of wing W2 at the C terminus of FoxO-DBD (Fig. 1B). Structures of HNF-3γ (FoxA3) and Genesis (FoxD3) complexes revealed that the cluster of basic residues in the wing W2 is involved in DNA binding (5Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 10Jin C. Marsden I. Chen X. Liao X. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, the removal of wing W2 abolishes DNA binding of forkhead transcription factor HNF-3α (29Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment between HNF-3γ, Genesis, and FoxO sequences suggests that analogue-basic residues forming the second FoxO PKB phosphorylation site and the 14-3-3 binding motif might participate in DNA binding as well (Fig. 1B). This similarity could explain the inhibitory effect of both the phosphorylation and the 14-3-3 protein on DNA-binding activity of FoxO proteins. However, the regulation of DNA binding among various FoxO proteins seems to differ significantly. It has been shown that the phosphorylation of the second PKB/14-3-3 binding motif in the wing W2 suppresses DNA binding of FoxO1 and FoxO6 factors (28Zhang X. Gan L. Pan H. Guo S. He X. Olson S.T.

Smidt M.P. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the PKB-induced phosphorylation of both DAF-16 (Caenorhabditis elegans FoxO homologue) and FoxO4 (fragment 11–213) does not by itself affect their binding to the target DNA (22Cahill C.M.

Anderson D.E. Hickman A.B. Dyda F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15264-15272Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Binding of the 14-3-3 protein to phosphorylated FoxO4 and DAF-16 has been shown to be necessary for complete inhibition of their binding to the DNA.To better understand these differences among FoxO-DBD, we investigated the role of N-terminal loop (portion located upstream of the first helix H1) and C-terminal region (loop known as wing W2) of forkhead domain of transcription factor FoxO4 in DNA binding. Although the deletion of either the N- or C-terminal portion of forkhead domain partly reduces the FoxO4-DBD binding to the DNA, the simultaneous deletion of both regions inhibits DNA binding significantly. Foörster resonance energy transfer measurements and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that both N- and C-terminal regions of FoxO4-DBD studied directly interact with the DNA. In the presence of N-terminal part the PKB-induced phosphorylation of wing W2 by itself has negligible effect on DNA binding. On the other hand, in the absence of this loop the phosphorylation of wing W2 significantly inhibits the FoxO4-DBD binding to the DNA. The binding of the 14-3-3 protein efficiently reduces DNA-binding potential of phosphorylated FoxO4-DBD regardless of the presence of N-terminal region. Our results show that both N- and C-terminal regions of forkhead domain are important for the stability of FoxO4-DBD·DNA complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression, Purification, and Phosphorylation of FoxO4-DBD—Expression plasmid for FoxO4-DBD (FoxO482–207) was a kind gift of Dr. J. Weigelt. FoxO4-DBD mutants containing a single Cys residue at two different positions in the wing W2 (mutation Ser183 → Cys and Ser193 → Cys) were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). To generate C-terminally truncated FoxO4-DBDΔC (FoxO482–183) a stop codon was introduced instead of Gly184. To create N-terminally truncated FoxO4-DBDΔN the DNA-encoding sequence FoxO498–199 was ligated into pET-15b (Novagen) using the NdeI site. To generate doubly truncated FoxO4-DBDΔNΔC, a stop codon was introduced into a DNA of FoxO4-DBDΔNat position 184. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. All versions and mutants of FoxO4-DBD have been expressed and purified as described previously (9Weigelt J. Climent I. Dahlman-Wright K. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5861-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, FoxO4-DBD was expressed as 6×His tag fusion proteins by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 12 h at 30 °C and purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells using Chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) according to the standard protocol. Eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.3), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT and purified using cation-exchange chromatography on an SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted using linear gradient of NaCl (50–1000 mm). Fractions containing FoxO4-DBD were dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 10% (v/w) glycerol. Purified FoxO4-DBD was then phosphorylated by incubation with 9 units of PKBα (Upstate Biotechnology) per milligram of recombinant protein for 2 h at 30 °C in the presence of 10 mm magnesium acetate and 0.2 mm ATP. After the phosphorylation, the FoxO4-DBD was re-purified using cation-exchange chromatography as mentioned above. Eluted proteins were finally dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The completeness of the phosphorylation reaction was checked using the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.Mass Spectrometric Analysis of FoxO4-DBD—Samples were first separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and excised protein bands were digested with Lys-C endoprotease (Promega, Madison, WI) directly in gel (31Kovarova H. Halada P. Man P. Golovliov I. Krocova Z. Spacek J. Porkertova S. Necasova R. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Resulting peptide mixtures were extracted by 30% acetonitrile and 0.3% acetic acid and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer BIFLEX (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) and gridless delayed extraction ion source. Ion acceleration voltage was 19 kV, and the reflectron voltage was set to 20 kV. Spectra were calibrated externally using the monoisotopic [M+H]+ ion of FoxO4 peptides with known sequence. A saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% MeCN/0.3% acetic acid was used as the MALDI matrix. 1 μl of the sample was loaded on the target, and the droplet was allowed to dry at ambient temperature, overlaid with 1 μl of matrix solution, and allowed to co-crystallize also at ambient temperature.Labeling of FoxO4-DBD Mutants by 1,5-IAEDANS—The Forkhead domain of FoxO4 (fragment 82–207) does not contain any cysteine residue. To prepare FoxO4-DBD specifically labeled with fluorescence probe at two different position in the wing W2 we inserted a single Cys residue at positions 183 (mutation Ser183 → Cys) and 193 (mutation Ser193 → Cys). Covalent modification of FoxO4-DBD containing single cysteine residue with thiol-reactive probe 1,5-IAEDANS was carried out as described elsewhere (32Silhan J. Obsilova V. Vecer J. Herman P. Sulc M. Teisinger J. Obsil T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49113-49119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein (50–70 μm) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and label were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:40 and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, and then at 4 °C overnight in the dark. The free unreacted label was removed by gel filtration in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The incorporation stoichiometry was determined by comparing the peak protein absorbance at 280 nm with the absorbance of bound 1.5-IAEDANS measured at 336 nm using an extinction coefficient of 5700 m-1 cm-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).Expression and Purification of 14-3-3 Protein—Human 14-3-3 protein (zeta isoform) was expressed and purified as described previously (33Obsil T. Ghirlando R. Klein D.C. Ganguly S. Dyda F. Cell. 2001; 105: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Briefly, 14-3-3ζ was expressed as a 6×His tag fusion protein by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 12 h at 20 °C and purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells using Chelating-Sepharose. The histidine tag was removed by incubation for 6 h at 15 °C with 10 units of thrombin/mg of protein. After cleavage, 14-3-3 protein was purified using anion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted using a 50–600 mm NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm DTT and dialyzed overnight against buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 10% (w/v) glycerol.Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence spectra were taken on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer at 22 °C with 0.6 μm protein and 0.6 μm dsDNA in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA in 10-mm cell. Excitation was done at 336 nm; the bandwidths were 5 nm for both excitation and emission. The following oligonucleotides containing consensus FoxO binding sequence were used to prepare samples of dsDNA: S1, 5′-GCGTTGTTTACGC-3′; S2, 5′-GCGTAAACAACGC-3′; fluorescein-labeled S1FLC, 5′-FLC-GCGTTGTTTACGC-3; and S2FLC, 5′-FLC-GCGTAAACAACGC-3′. Double-stranded DNA denoted as “S1FLC/S2” was prepared by mixing oligonucleotides S1FLC and S2; dsDNA denoted as “S1/S2FLC” was prepared by mixing oligonucleotides S1 and S2FLC.Steady-state Fluorescence Anisotropy DNA Binding Measurements—Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence spectrometer at 22 °C with 100 nm dsDNA labeled with fluorescein at the 5′ terminus of both strands (S1FLC/S2FLC). Increasing amounts of protein were titrated into the cuvette. At each FoxO4-DBD concentration, the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein was recorded (excitation at 494 nm and emission at 520 nm). Anisotropy was calculated from the fluorescence intensities according to the relationship, r = (III – I⊥)/(III + 2I⊥). The fraction of DNA bound (FB) was calculated from Equation 1, FB=(robs-rmin)/[(rmax-robs)Q+(robs-rmin)]Eq. 1 where Q represents the quantum yield ratio of the bound to the free form; it was estimated by calculating the ratio of the intensities of the bound to the free fluorophore. Parameter rmax is the anisotropy at saturation, robs is the observed anisotropy for any FoxO4-DBD concentration, and rmin is the minimum observed anisotropy of the free DNA. FB was plotted against the FoxO4-DBD protein concentration and fitted using Equation 2 to determine the KD for FoxO4-DBD·dsDNA complex formation (34Kohler J.J. Schepartz A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), FB=KD+[P1]+[P2]-(KD+[P1]+[P2])2-4[P1][P2]2[P1]Eq. 2 where KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant, [P1]isthe dsDNA-fluorescein concentration, and [P2] is the FoxO4-DBD concentration. Non-linear data fitting was performed using the Origin 6.0 package (MicroCal Software Inc.).Time-resolved Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was observed between the AEDANS moiety covalently attached to Cys183 or Cys193 of FoxO4-DBD and fluorescein (FLC) moiety attached to the 5′ terminus of one of the dsDNA strands. Fluorescence intensity decays were measured on the laser-based time-correlated single photon counting apparatus with multichannel plate photomultiple detection described in detail previously (35Obsilova V. Herman P. Vecer J. Sulc M. Teisinger J. Obsil T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4531-4540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fluorescence decays have been acquired under the “magic angle” conditions when the measured intensity decay I(t) is independent of a rotational diffusion of the chromophore and provides unbiased information about fluorescence lifetimes. The samples were placed in a thermostatic holder, and all experiments were performed at 15 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. FoxO4-DBD concentration was 2.4 μm, and dsDNA concentration was 6 μm. Dansyl fluorescence was excited and collected at 315 and 370 nm, respectively. Fluorescence decays were processed using the singular value decomposition maximum entropy method, and mean lifetimes were calculated as described previously (35Obsilova V. Herman P. Vecer J. Sulc M. Teisinger J. Obsil T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4531-4540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The averaged efficiency of energy transfer E was calculated from the mean donor lifetime in the presence (τDA) and in the absence of acceptor (τD) in Equation 3. E=1-(τDA/τD)Eq. 3 The average distance between the donor-acceptor pair R was calculated from Equation 4, R=R0⋅1/E-16Eq. 4 where R0 is the critical Foörster distance (the distance at which the energy transfer occurs with 50% efficiency). An R0 value of 49 Aå determined for AEDANS and fluorescein pair was used to calculate R (36Squier T.C. Bigelow D.J. Deancos J.G. Inesi G. J. Biol.

Pande V.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2472-2493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To prepare the starting structure the solution structure of FoxO4-DBD (sequence 92–181, PDB access code 1E17) was fitted onto the co-crystal structure of transcription factor HNF-3γ with bound DNA (5Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 9Weigelt J. Climent I. Dahlman-Wright K. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5861-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The missing wing W2 of FoxO4-DBD was modeled (up to residue 193) using the structures of transcription factors HNF-3 and Genesis as templates (5Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 10Jin C. Marsden I. Chen X. Liao X. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Coordinates of dsDNA (S1/S2) containing the consensus FoxO binding sequence (5′-GCGTTGTTTACGC-3′) were generated using the FIBER program from the 3DNA package (39Lu X.J. Olson W.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5108-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The molecule of dsDNA was oriented in such a way that the motif 5′-TGTTT-3′ was superimposed with the motifs 5′-TATTT-3′ from the solution structure of Genesis·DNA complex and 5′-GACTT-3′ from the crystal structure of HNF-3γ·DNA complex. FoxO4-DBD·DNA complex was then solvated with water in a periodic box using the TIP3P water model (40Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29134) Google Scholar). All water molecules within 1.5 Aå of any protein or DNA atom were removed. The system was electroneutralized by replacing water molecules with the highest electrostatic potential energy with Na+ ions. Next, the resulting system was energy-minimized using the steepest descent method. This was followed by a 50-ps equilibration MD run during which position restraints were applied on the complex. The system was then set completely free, and an MD simulation 40 ns long at 300 K temperature and 1 bar pressure was performed. Simulation of FoxO4-DBD alone (20 ns long) was performed using the same protocol. Both simulations were run with a 2-fs time step. Solute, solvent, and counterions were independently weakly coupled to a reference temperature bath (41Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. Vangunsteren W.F. Dinola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem.

The initial velocities were obtained from a Maxwellian distribution at the desired temperature. The pressure was controlled using the Berendsen algorithm with a coupling constant of τP = 0.5 ps. All bond lengths were constrained using LINCS (42Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C. Fraaije J.G.E.M. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11142) Google Scholar).

The cut-off for van der Waals interactions was set to 9 Aå. Trajectories were analyzed using the GROMACS software package (44Van der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Hess B. Groenhof G. Mark A.E. Berendsen H.

FoxO4-DBD protein and its N-terminally truncated version FoxO4-DBDΔN were phosphorylated by PKB, and the result of phosphorylation reaction was determined using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

Although both cell types have an intact vitamin D receptor-signaling axis, this study demonstrates that upon treatment with calcitriol, 24-hydroxylase (CYP24) mRNA, protein and enzymatic activity were markedly induced in MDEC in a time-dependent manner but not in TDEC. Furthermore, treatment of MDEC with a CYP24 small interfering RNA restored sensitivity to calcitriol. To investigate the lack of CYP24 induction in TDEC, we examined methylation patterns in the promoter regions of the CYP24 gene in these two cell types. We identified two putative CpG island regions located at the 5′ end. Using methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing, we determined that these CpG islands were hypermethylated in TDEC but not in MDEC. These data may explain the recruitment of vitamin D receptor to the promoter region in MDEC but not TDEC, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses. Treatment of TDEC with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine restored calcitriol-mediated induction of CYP24, which led to loss of sensitivity to calcitriol growth inhibitory effects. CYP24 promoter hypermethylation was also observed in endothelial cells isolated from other tumors but not in endothelial cells isolated from normal mouse tissues. These observations indicate that the methylation status of the CYP24 promoter differs in endothelial cells isolated from different microenvironments (tumor versus normal) and that methylation silencing of CYP24 contributes to selective calcitriol-mediated growth inhibition in endothelial cells.

Although 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), the most active metabolite of vitamin D3, is well known for its function in regulating calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization, it also plays a major role in modulating cellular proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cell types, including tumor cells (1Pols H.A.

In addition, the expression of the key enzyme of vitamin D catabolism, CYP24, also allows for a tight control of the effects of vitamin D in target tissues (7Prosser D.E. Jones G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 664-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Ligand-activated VDR induces expression of CYP24, which initiates inactivation and degradation of calcitriol by hydroxylation at C-24 (7Prosser D.E. Jones G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 664-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CYP24 has been documented in prostate, colon, and breast cancer during tumor progression (8Cross H.S. Kallay E. Lechner D. Gerdenitsch W. Adlercreutz H. Armbrecht H.J. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 1207S-1212SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanism of resistance of these tumor types to calcitriol treatment. Other than tumor cells, the effect of calcitriol on other cell types in the tumor microenvironment has not been extensively studied. Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D can also act on tumor vasculature (9Mantell D.J. Owens P.E. Bundred N.J. Mawer E.B. Canfield A.E. Circ.

The endothelial cells recruited to form blood vessels in the tumor are thought to be similar to those found in normal tissues and thus less likely to develop drug resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies. However, recent data indicate that tumor-associated endothelial cells differ from endothelial cells found in normal tissues. Genetic, chromosomal, and functional abnormalities have been observed in tumor endothelial cells (11Hida K. Hida Y. Amin D.N. Flint A.F. Panigrahy D. Morton C.C. Klagsbrun M.

Hence, studies to compare the biological effects of calcitriol on tumor vasculature and normal vasculature are crucial. We have established a method to obtain an enriched population of endothelial cells from tumors (tumor-derived endothelial cells, TDEC) and non-tumor microenvironments (normal tissues and Matrigel plugs) (13Modzelewski R.A. Davies P. Watkins S.C. Auerbach R. Chang M.J. Johnson C.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 336-339PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chung I. Wong M.K. Flynn G. Yu W.D. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8565-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Using this model, we demonstrated that calcitriol has selective growth inhibitory effects on endothelial cells isolated from tumors compared with microvascular Matrigel-derived endothelial cells (MDEC) (14Chung I. Wong M.K. Flynn G. Yu W.D. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8565-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When treated with calcitriol, only endothelial cells derived from tumors exhibited cell growth inhibition, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis (14Chung I. Wong M.K. Flynn G. Yu W.D. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8565-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These differential responses were intriguing as both endothelial cell types showed activated VDR protein expression after treatment with calcitriol (14Chung I. Wong M.K. Flynn G. Yu W.D. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8565-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additionally, the VDR-mediated gene transcription pathway was not impaired in either cell types, although activated at different level, as demonstrated in VDR-retinoid X receptor nuclear translocation and reporter promoter transactivation (14Chung I. Wong M.K. Flynn G. Yu W.D. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8565-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the current study, we hypothesized that differential expression and activity of CYP24 in TDEC and MDEC could contribute to the underlying differences in the endothelial cell response to calcitriol. Chemicals and Reagents—Calcitriol (Hoffmann-LaRoche) was reconstituted in 100% ethanol and stored, protected from light, under a layer of nitrogen gas at –70 °C. For most applications, calcitriol was used at 10 nm because this concentration consistently shows anti-proliferative effects in multiple assays in a variety of tumor cell types (data not shown). 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) (Sigma) was reconstituted in PBS. All agents were diluted to the appropriate final concentrations in tissue culture medium immediately prior to use. Mouse anti-CYP24 antibody was a gift from Cytochroma Inc. (Ontario, Canada). Cells and Treatment—Isolation and characterization of TDECs from the squamous cell carcinoma VII/SF murine cells (TDEC) and the radiation-induced fibrosarcoma-1 (RIF-1) cells (TDECRIF) were reported previously (13Modzelewski R.A. Davies P. Watkins S.C. Auerbach R. Chang M.J. Johnson C.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 336-339PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tumors were harvested, and a single cell suspension was prepared using an enzyme mixture including ribonucleases and collagenases. Cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked antibodies specific for the endothelial cell markers (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule and angiotensin-converting enzyme) and sorted by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry. TDECPC3 were isolated from xenograft human prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3) tumors in nude mice, mouse pulmonary endothelial cells (MPEC) were from normal C3H mouse lung tissues, and mouse brain endothelial cells (MBEC) were isolated from normal C3H mouse brain tissues using a similar method. Murine yolk sac endothelial cells (MYSEC) were from Dr. Robert Auerbach (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and were derived using a similar method. MDEC were isolated from Matrigel plugs implanted in C3H mice, as described previously (14Chung I. Wong M.K. Flynn G. Yu W.D. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8565-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All endothelial cell types were cultured initially in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, supplemented with sarcoma 180-conditioned medium, 5 units/ml heparin (Sigma), basal medium Eagle vitamin solution (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES buffer (Invitrogen) and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Fisher). Once endothelial cells were established, they were grown on 1% gelatin-coated flasks in basic Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented by 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate. For promoter DNA methylation analysis, cells used were below passage 3, and for other experiments, they were below 8 passages. Reverse Transcription and Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RT-PCR of Cyp24 and Gapdh were performed using 2 μg of total RNA and the SuperScript III transcriptase (Invitrogen) and TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplification condition for both Cyp24 and Gapdh PCR were 1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C (Cyp24) or 50 °C (Gapdh) for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels. For both RT-PCR and qRT-PCR, specific primers used to amplify mouse Cyp24 were +987 5′-AGTGAGCTGAACAAATGGTC-3′ and +1458 5′-GTCTGGTTGTCAGGCAGCAC-3′ and mouse Gapdh were (+948) 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ and (+1390) 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′. qRT-PCR was performed using the 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA) and Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem) with a total of 25 μl per reaction. The amplification conditions for both Cyp24 and Gapdh were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 81 °C for 1 min, followed by a disassociation curve analysis to confirm specific product formation. The copy number for each gene was determined using a standard curve containing serial dilutions (108–100 copies) of the respective amplicons. All samples were analyzed in triplicate using 7300 System SDS Software (Applied Biosystem). The results were determined by the ratio of Cyp24/Gapdh in each cDNA sample. Western Blot Analysis—Endothelial cells were plated at 1–3 × 105 cells/T75 flask. 24 h post-plating, the cells were treated with vehicle or 10 nm calcitriol for various time points. Cells were then harvested, and whole cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) as described previously (15Hershberger P.A. Modzelewski R.A. Shurin Z.R. Rueger R.M. Trump D.L. Johnson C.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2644-2649PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred overnight to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antibodies used included VDR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and CYP24 (Cytochroma). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and actin was detected using the actin (Ab-1) kit from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA). 25-(OH)D3-24-Hydroxylase Assay—Endothelial cells were plated and treated with either vehicle or 10 nm calcitriol for 24 or 48 h. Cells were then washed with CYP24 buffer (0.19 m sucrose, 25 mm sodium succinate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA and 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4)) and harvested by scraping. CYP24 activity was assayed using [26,27-3H]-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 ([3H]25-D3) as a substrate. The assay consisting of 250 μg of cellular protein in 0.5 ml of CYP24 buffer was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.05 μCi (110,000 dpm) of [3H]25-D3. Blank assays contained no cellular proteins. [3H]25-D3 oxidative metabolites were extracted by liquid/liquid partition using tetrahydrofuran and ethyl acetate (16Honda A. Nakashima N. Shida Y. Mori Y. Nagata A. Ishizuka S. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), dried, and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a 4.6 × 250-mm Zorbax SIL column (Agilent Technologies Inc, Palo Alto, CA) using hexane/isopropanol (94:6 v/v) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min as the mobile phase. Radioactivity in the HPLC fractions co-eluting with 24,25-D3 peak were pooled and CYP24 activity (fmol/min/mg of protein) were calculated after the subtraction of the radioactivity counts recovered in the blank assays (17Muindi J.R. Peng Y. Wilson J.W. Johnson C.S. Branch R.A. Trump D.L. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2007; 59: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Assay for 1,25(OH)2D3 Metabolites—Endothelial cells were plated in charcoal-stripped medium and treated for 48 h with 10 nm calcitriol containing 1% [26,27-3H]-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ([3H]1,25-D3) as a tracer. Cells were collected by trypsinization. Calcitriol and its metabolites were extracted by liquid/liquid partition using methanol and methylene chloride, dried, and analyzed by HPLC as described above using hexane/isopropanol/methanol (90:5:5 v/v). Radioactivity in the HPLC fractions co-eluting with 1,25-D3 and its metabolites peak were pooled, and the amount of 1,25-D3 and the metabolites were calculated. Synthetic Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA specific for murine CYP24, siCONTROL-nonspecific siRNA (siRNA-NS), and DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). MDEC cells were plated in 6-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) overnight. Cells were transfected with 75 nm siRNA-CYP24 or 75 nm siRNA-NS for 24 h using Dharma-FECT 1 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. Following transfection, the cells were treated with either vehicle or calcitriol for 48 h and harvested for experiments as indicated. Tetrazolium Salt 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay—After MDEC were transfected with siRNA, the cells harvested by adding 20 μl of 0.5% MTT (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and the cells were solubilized with 10% SDS, 10 mm HCl overnight at 37 °C. The absorbance was read with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Spectra Max 340PC) at 490 nm. Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay—TDEC were plated at 5 × 103 in 24-well plates 24 h before treatment of 0.25 μm 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Sigma). After 96 h, cells were treated either with vehicle or varying concentrations of calcitriol for additional 48 h. Cells were trypsinized and viable cell count was measured using ViCell XR (Beckman Coulter). CYP24 Promoter DNA Methylation Analysis—Genomic DNA was isolated using the genomic DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). DNA (1 μg) was converted with sodium bisulfite using the EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bisulfite-modified DNA was purified with Wizard DNA purification resin (Promega, Madison, WI) and subjected to methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The primers used for MSP were designed using Methprimer (18Li L.C. Dahiya R. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar) and were: methylated region 1, (–427) 5′-GTTAATGAGTACGTTGAATAAGGGC-3′ (forward) and (–598) 5′-GAAATAAAATCCACCACGATACG-3′ (reverse) (annealing temperature (Ta), 50 °C); unmethylated region, (–426) 5′-GGTTAATGAGTATGTTGAATAAGGGT-3′ (forward) and (–598) 5′-AAAATAAAATCCACCACAATACATC-3′ (reverse) (Ta, 50 °C); methylated region 2, (+596) 5′-ATTATTAGTTCGTAGGTTTCGTTGC-3′ (forward) and (+446) 5′-TAAAACTAAACTCCTTCGACTCGAT-3′ (reverse) (Ta, 48 °C); unmethylated region 2, (+591) 5′-TTAGTTTGTAGGTTTTGTTGTGA-3′ (forward) and (+446) 5′-AAAACTAAACTCCTTCAACTCAAT-3′ (reverse) (Ta, 49 °C). PCR included an initial incubation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, Ta for 30 s and 72 °C for 40 s, followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. MSP PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Fully methylated control DNA and unmethylated control DNA were generated by incubation of TDEC genomic DNA with SssI methylase (New England Biolabs) or TDEC DNA amplification with GenomiPhi™ (Amersham Biosciences) reaction, respectively. The primers for bisulfite sequencing of CYP24 were designed using MethPrimer (18Li L.C. Dahiya R. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar) and were: region 1, (–412) 5′-GTATGTTGGAGGTGGTTAATGAGTA-3′ (forward) and (–788) 5′-AAACAACATTCATCCAAAAAAAATC-3′ (reverse); region 2, (+614) 5′-GGGGATTGATTTATAGGATTATTAGTT-3′ (forward) and (+416) 5′-ACCACAAAAAATATAACCAAATTTTC-3′ (reverse). PCR included an initial incubation at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s, followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR®4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen). A total of 12 clones from each sample were sequenced using ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and methylation status at each CpG position were analyzed using DNASTAR software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). Quantitative methylation analysis of the CYP24 promoter was performed using the MassARRAY Compact system (Sequenom, San Diego, CA). This system utilizes mass spectrometry (MS) for the detection and quantitative analysis of DNA methylation using homogeneous MassCLEAVE base-specific cleavage and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS (19Ehrich M. Nelson M.R. Stanssens P. Zabeau M. Liloglou T. Xinarianos G. Cantor C.R. Field J.K. van den Boom D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15785-15790Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated using the genomic DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). DNA (1 μg) was converted with sodium bisulfite using the EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bisulfite-treated DNA was subjected to CYP24A1 specific PCR to CpG regions 1 and 2. The primers were designed using Methprimer and were (underlined nucleotides are gene-specific-sequences): Region 1, 5′-AGGAAGAGAGTATGTTGGAGGTGGTTAATGAGTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAGGCTCCAAAAAAAATCCAACTCAAACTAC-3′ (reverse) (Ta, 56 °C); Region 2, 5′-AGGAAGAGAGTTAGTTTTAGGTAGAGTAGGGGTTTTATAT3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAGGCTCAAAAAAAACTCAAATCAACAACTC-3′ (reverse) (Ta, 56 °C). Each reverse primer has a T7-promotor tag for in vitro transcription (5′-cagtaatacgactcactatagggagaaggct-3′), and the forward primer is tagged with a 10-mer to balance PCR (5′-aggaagagag-3′). Region 1 and 2 amplicons are –413 to –856 (444 bp) and +732 to +321 (412 bp) from the transcription start site, respectively. Amplification of 1 μl of bisulfite-treated DNA (∼20 ng/μl) was performed using HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen) in a 5-μl reaction volume using PCR primers at a 200 nm final concentration. PCR amplification was performed with the following parameters: 94 °C for 15 min hot start, followed by denaturing at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 45 cycles, and final incubation at 72 °C for 3 min. After shrimp alkaline phosphatase treatment, 2 μl of the PCR products were used as a template for in vitro transcription and RNase A cleavage for the T-reverse reaction as per the manufacture's instructions (Sequenom). The samples were conditioned and spotted on a 384-pad SpectroCHIP (Sequenom) using a MassARRAY nanodispenser (Samsung, Irvine, CA), followed by spectral acquisition on a MassARRAY Analyzer Compact matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS (Sequenom). The resultant methylation calls were performed by the EpiTyper software v1.0 (Sequenom) to generate quantitative results for each CpG site or an aggregate of multiple CpG sites. Quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR Analyses (qChIP-PCR)—TDEC and MDEC were treated with either vehicle or 10 nm calcitriol for 6 h. Following trypsinization, cell suspensions were treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was terminated with addition of glycine (0.125 m final concentration). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1 × PBS containing phosphatase inhibitors and pepstatin A. The chromatin pellets were sonicated in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA. 50 mm Tris (pH 8.1)) to an average DNA size of 500 bp with a Fisher model 50 sonic dismembranator using an optimized sonication condition. The sonicated extract was centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed and diluted with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 167 mm NaCl) before precleared with salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose slurry for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C overnight with either VDR (3 μl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 μl (Abcam)) or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After 1-h incubation with salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose slurry, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation. Precipitates were washed sequentially in low salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl), high salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 500 mm NaCl), LiCl immune complex wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA-630, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.1)), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) twice. Elution of the immunoprecipitated chromatin complexes were performed with 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. The DNA-protein cross-linking was reversed by incubating at 65 °C overnight in elution buffer with 0.2 m NaCl. DNA fragments were obtained using phenol-chloroform extraction. DNA samples and standards were analyzed using 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystem) and Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem). Primers used to amplify CYP24 and osteopontin promoter were as described (20Liu Y. Shen Q. Malloy P.J. Soliman E. Peng X. Kim S. Pike J.W. Feldman D. Christakos S. J.

The following cycling parameters were used: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 58–59 °C for 30 s, and 78–85 °C for 1 min. Dissociation curves were performed to confirm specificity of the amplification products. All samples were run in triplicate and all data were normalized with control IgG and 5% input DNA amplification. Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences were assessed using the Student's t test (two-tail). All data are expressed as the mean (with standard deviation) of at least three determinants, unless stated otherwise. Differential Induction of CYP24 by Calcitriol in TDEC and MDEC—Both TDEC and MDEC activate VDR signaling pathway upon treatment of calcitriol although selective growth inhibition was observed in TDEC (14Chung I. Wong M.K. Flynn G. Yu W.D. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8565-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We investigated calcitriol-mediated induction of CYP24 as a possible mechanism to account for this differential effect. Strikingly, treatment with 10 nm calcitriol at various time points induced CYP24 mRNA and protein expression in MDEC but not in TDEC (Fig. 1, A and B). The induction of CYP24 mRNA in MDEC was observed as early as 3 h and was sustained for over 48 h post-treatment (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, CYP24 protein was expressed in a time dependent manner in MDEC, while no protein expression was observed in TDEC (Fig. 1B). We further confirmed the enzymatic activity of CYP24 protein induced by calcitriol in both cell types using HPLC (Fig. 1C). In MDEC, treatment with 10 nm calcitriol for 24 and 48 h resulted in ∼4- and 7-fold increase of CYP24 enzymatic activity, respectively, compared with the vehicle; no induction of CYP24 activity was observed in calcitriol-treated TDEC. Calcitriol content within the cells was measured after 48 h treatment (Fig. 1D). Calcitriol levels were significantly lower in MDEC (9.3 × 10–5 nmol/106 cells) compared with TDEC (3.3 × 10–3 nmol/106 cells) (p < 0.005). Among the calcitriol metabolites, we determined that 1,25(OH)2D3,26,23-lactone was the major metabolite detectable in these cells under these conditions. There was about 8.9 × 10–4 nmol/106 cells 1,25(OH)2D3,26,23-lactone detected in MDEC but none in TDEC (p < 0.005). These data indicate that high CYP24 induction in MDEC correlates with depleted calcitriol level in the cell. Differential induction of CYP24 by calcitriol in MDEC and TDEC could be a mechanism accounting for the lack of response in MDEC to calcitriol-mediated growth inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whet"
https://openalex.org/W2072256609,"To define how extracellular signals activate bacterial receptor Ser/Thr protein kinases, we characterized the regulatory functions of a weak dimer interface identified in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis PknB and PknE receptor kinases. Sequence comparisons revealed that the analogous interface is conserved in PknD orthologs from diverse bacterial species. To analyze the roles of dimerization, we constructed M. tuberculosis PknD kinase domain (KD) fusion proteins that formed dimers upon addition of rapamycin. Dimerization of unphosphorylated M. tuberculosis PknD KD fusions stimulated phosphorylation activity. Mutations in the dimer interface reduced this activation, limited autophosphorylation, and altered substrate specificity. In contrast, an inactive catalytic site mutant retained the ability to stimulate the wild-type KD by dimerization. These results support the idea that dimer formation allosterically activates unphosphorylated PknD. The phosphorylated PknD KD was fully active even in the absence of dimerization, suggesting that phosphorylation provides an additional regulatory mechanism. The conservation of analogous dimers in diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein kinases implies that this mechanism of protein kinase regulation is ancient and broadly distributed.

Tight regulation of Ser/Thr protein kinases (STPKs) 2The abbreviations used are: STPK, Ser/Thr protein kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; FKBP, FK-506-binding protein; FRAP, FK506-binding protein-rapamycin-associated protein; KD, kinase domain; MyBP, myelin basic protein; PKR, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; WT, wild-type; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: STPK, Ser/Thr protein kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; FKBP, FK-506-binding protein; FRAP, FK506-binding protein-rapamycin-associated protein; KD, kinase domain; MyBP, myelin basic protein; PKR, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; WT, wild-type; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA. is essential for signaling in all three kingdoms of life. In keeping with the importance of phospho-signaling pathways, STPKs are subject to multiple mechanisms of allosteric regulation (1Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Diverse regulatory surfaces of kinase domains (KDs) can bind additional proteins (as in the cyclin-dependent kinases and cAMP-dependent protein kinase) or other domains of the kinase itself (such as the Src homology 2 and linker domains of Src). These interactions often affect the assembly of the catalytic site by positioning a conserved, substrate-binding element called the C helix. In addition, phosphorylation of a conserved motif called the activation loop often relieves a steric blockade of the active site and promotes assembly of a substrate-binding platform (1Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Although many regulatory interactions have been characterized in eukaryotic protein kinases, the mechanisms by which environmental signals regulate prokaryotic STPKs have yet to be elucidated. Prokaryotic STPKs occur in numerous pathogens and organisms with complex developmental pathways (2Greenstein A.E. Grundner C. Echols N. Gay L.M. Lombana T.N. Miecskowski C.A. Pullen K.E. Sung P.Y. Alber T. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 9: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Like their eukaryotic homologs, the bacterial STPKs adopt a characteristic two-domain fold with the ATP-binding site located between the N- and C-terminal lobes (3Gay L.M. Ng H.L. Alber T. J. Mol.

Unexpectedly, the catalytic domain of the receptor STPK PknB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis formed an unstable, back-to-back dimer through an interface in the N-terminal lobe (Fig. 1A) (3Gay L.M. Ng H.L. Alber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4Ortiz-Lombardia M. Pompeo F. Boitel B. Alzari P.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Residues in the PknB dimer interface were found to be strictly conserved in orthologs from dozens of bacterial genera, supporting the proposal that KD dimerization plays an important functional role (5Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A. Falick A.M. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Because the dimer interface included contacts near the C terminus of the C helix, it was proposed that dimerization regulates PknB (5Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A. Falick A.M. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This idea was reinforced by the structure of the M. tuberculosis PknD extracellular domain, which includes a rigid β-propeller motif flexibly tethered to the single, predicted transmembrane helix (6Good M.C. Greenstein A.E. Young T.A. Ng H.L. Alber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This arrangement was consistent with a model in which dimerization or localization of the extracellular domain, rather than a conformational change transmitted across the membrane, serves to regulate the intracellular kinase domains (2Greenstein A.E. Grundner C. Echols N. Gay L.M. Lombana T.N. Miecskowski C.A. Pullen K.E. Sung P.Y. Alber T. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 9: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Young T.A.

Biol. 2004; 339: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further support of a regulatory role for dimerization was provided by the crystal structure of the M. tuberculosis PknE KD, which crystallized as a back-to-back dimer similar to that formed by the PknB KD (Fig. 1A), despite the absence of sequence homology in the interfacial residues (3Gay L.M. Ng H.L. Alber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the 11 M. tuberculosis STPKs indicated that the predicted dimer interface residues are more similar in PknB, -A, and -L; PknD, -E, and -H; and PknF, -I, and -J, but these three clades are distinct from each other (Fig. 1B) (3Gay L.M. Ng H.L. Alber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This conservation within three paralogous branches of M. tuberculosis STPKs supported the importance of the back-to-back pairing interface. Consistent with the proposed regulatory role in PknB and PknE, formation of a structurally similar dimer was found to activate the human dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR; Fig. 1A) KD in response to double-stranded RNA binding to the ligand-binding domain (7Dar A.C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2005; 122: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 8Dey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Here we provide experimental evidence that dimerization activates M. tuberculosis PknD. To test the functional roles of dimerization, we used rapamycin to bring together FKBP (FK506-binding protein) and FRAP (FK506-binding proteinrapamycin-associated protein) fusions to the PknD KD. Dimerization strongly activated the unphosphorylated PknD KD, particularly when tested using a cognate in vivo substrate. In contrast, dimerization caused little or no further activation of the active, autophosphorylated KD fusions. The predicted intersubunit contact residues were found to be conserved in orthologs of M. tuberculosis PknD. Mutation of conserved residues in the predicted dimer interface reduced activation, inhibited autophosphorylation, and altered substrate specificity. Remarkably, association with a catalytically inactive mutant containing a normal dimer interface activated the unphosphorylated wild-type (WT) KD fusion. These data support the conclusion that back-to-back dimerization allosterically regulates diverse protein kinases in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Sequence Comparisons—Ser/Thr kinase sequences were extracted from the NCBI RefSeq data base (9Pruitt K.D. Tatusova T. Maglott D.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W299-W302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) was used to visualize the sequence conservation mapped onto the structures of PknB or PknE. DNA Constructs—The pET-24b vector (Novagen) was adapted by inserting 2 bases between the SacI and SalI restriction sites to facilitate the insertion of consecutive in-frame open reading frames. DNA fragments encoding FKBP and the minimal functional domain of FRAP (the FRB domain) (14Choi J. Chen J. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1996; 273: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) were cloned from a vector generously provided by Michael Schelle (University of California, Berkeley) with a 5′-flanking HindIII site and a 3′-flanking XhoI site. Amplified FKBP or FRAP DNA was digested with HindIII and XhoI and ligated into similarly digested vector DNA to create the vectors pAG-FK and pAG-FR, respectively. In M. tuberculosis PknD, the KD (∼290 amino acids) is followed by an 88-amino acid flexible linker (also called the juxtamembrane domain), a 20-amino acid transmembrane helix, a 10-amino acid tether, and a 262-amino acid β-propeller domain. A fragment corresponding to the first 378 amino acids of PknD was cloned with flanking 5′ NdeI and 3′ BamHI sites from M. tuberculosis genomic DNA as described (5Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A. Falick A.M. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The double-digested, amplified PknD fragment was ligated into pAG-FK or pAG-FR to create PknD-FK or PknD-FR, respectively. Expression and Purification—Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene) as described (5Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A. Falick A.M. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance (A600) of 1.8 in Terrific Broth (Research Products International), moved to 18 °C for 10 min, induced using 300 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.3 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml chelating Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.1 m NiSO4 and eluted in lysis buffer with 300 mm imidazole. After dialysis into 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.65), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm TCEP, each protein was further purified by gel-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). To dephosphorylate the KDs, the His6 tag was first removed from PknD by incubation with thrombin (10 units per mg of PknD) in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.65), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm TCEP. A mixture of 20:1 (w/w) PknD/His6-PstP was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 mm MnCl2 (15Pullen K.E. Ng H.L. Sung P.Y. Good M.C. Smith S.M. Alber T. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1947-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and separated on chelating Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.1 m NiSO4. The flow-through and first wash fractions were concentrated using VivaSpin 2-ml concentrators (VivaScience), and the absence of contaminating His6-PstP was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of an overloaded sample. Kinase Assays—Reactions were performed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.65), 0.5 mm TCEP, and 2 mm MnCl2. Each KD fusion protein was added to a final concentration of 40 nm (80 nm total kinase). Myelin basic protein (MyBP) and purified Rv0516c (containing N-terminal His6 and maltose-binding protein tags) (16Greenstein A.E. MacGurn J.A. Baer C.E. Falick A.M. Cox J.S. Alber T. PLoS Pathogens. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) were assayed at 27 and 16 μm, respectively. Excess rapamycin (final concentration of 10 μm) in ethanol or an equivalent volume of ethanol was added to each reaction. This mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and the reaction was initiated by adding 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (250 nCi/μl; ICN) in 2 mm cold ATP (Sigma). The final reaction volume was 20 μl. MyBP reactions were quenched with 5 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE loading dye. Rv0516c reactions were first quenched by adding EDTA (50 mm) and tobacco etch virus protease (24 μm). After 30 min of protease digestion to separate the His-MBP tag from Rv0516c, 5 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE loading dye was added. All reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4-12% NuPAGE NOVEX BisTris gels (Invitrogen). The gels were dried, and radioactivity was quantified with a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The autophosphorylation and MyBP reactions were monitored at 10, 20, and 30 min, whereas Rv0516c phosphorylation reactions were monitored at 15, 30, and 60 min to increase the amount of radioactive product. All assays were repeated at least three times. The effects of dimerization were quantified using ImageQuant™ (GE Healthcare) assuming a linear activation model by calculating the average ratio of the signals obtained at each time point in the presence and absence of rapamycin. Kinase Phosphorylation Analysis—Each PknD variant was expressed and purified as described above for the WT protein. The protein was dialyzed into 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm TCEP, and 10% glycerol (v/v), loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Q-Sepharose ion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) in the same buffer, and eluted with a 0.05-1 m NaCl gradient in 150 ml. The protein was concentrated to ∼2 mg/ml. The mass of the intact protein was determined by electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry. The Y81A mutant was further analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to determine the average mass. The identification of the anti-σ-factor antagonist homolog Rv0516c as an in vivo substrate of PknD (16Greenstein A.E. MacGurn J.A. Baer C.E. Falick A.M. Cox J.S. Alber T. PLoS Pathogens. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) afforded an opportunity to explore the activity and specificity of an M. tuberculosis STPK using a functional, cognate substrate. Phosphorylation of Rv0516c Thr-2 blocks binding to another σ-factor regulator (Rv2638) and markedly alters transcription of σ-F-dependent genes in vivo (16Greenstein A.E. MacGurn J.A. Baer C.E. Falick A.M. Cox J.S. Alber T. PLoS Pathogens. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other reported M. tuberculosis STPK substrates (2Greenstein A.E. Grundner C. Echols N. Gay L.M.

PknD Conservation—To explore the potential role of dimerization in regulating M. tuberculosis PknD, we first assessed the conservation of predicted dimer-interface residues in the KDs of PknD orthologs. The PknD KD is 39 and 65% identical, respectively, to the KDs of PknB and PknE, but the structure and capability for dimerization of the PknD KD tethered to the membrane are not known. PFAM domain assignments for all available prokaryotic kinase sequences in the NCBI RefSeq data base identified 10 potential PknD orthologs with shared domain architecture. These receptor kinases contained a KD linked through a single transmembrane helix to extracellular NHL repeats predicted to form a β-propeller. The 10 orthologous KDs showed 34-82% sequence identity with M. tuberculosis PknD. Mapping the level of sequence conservation onto the crystal structure of the KD of M. tuberculosis PknE revealed that the predicted dimer interface of PknD is highly conserved in orthologs (Fig. 1C). In concert with the conservation of the dimer interface in PknB orthologs (5Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A. Falick A.M. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), this analysis suggested that dimerization is conserved in certain prokaryotic receptor STPKs. Activity of PknD Dimers on Three Substrates—To test the role of the observed dimer interface in PknD regulation, we measured the effects of dimerization on kinase activity. Because the isolated M. tuberculosis KDs are monomeric at concentrations used in biochemical assays (3Gay L.M. Ng H.L. Alber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), 3T. N. Lombana and T. Alber, unpublished results. we fused the PknD KD to proteins that form heterodimers in the presence of the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin. The fusions contained the first 378 amino acids of PknD, encompassing the kinase domain (∼290 amino acids) and the juxtamembrane linker (88 amino acids). This intracellular segment of PknD was joined to the FKBP (gi 30585002) or the minimal binding domain (FRB domain) of the FRAP (gi 19924298). FKBP binds rapamycin with subnanomolar affinity, and FRAP subsequently binds the FKBP-rapamycin complex (14Choi J. Chen J. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1996; 273: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). This binding brings together the attached PknD KDs with physical constraints similar to those that would be imposed by dimerization of the extracellular domain of the full-length receptor (Fig. 2A). Rapamycin-induced dimerization raises the effective concentration of the KDs and favors formation of KD dimers. Assays using a 1:1 mixture of purified PknD KD fusions that were phosphorylated during production in Escherichia coli showed that rapamycin induced little or no increase in kinase activity (Fig. 2B). Activity was monitored on three substrates as follows: the KD itself; a noncognate substrate with multiple phosphorylation sites, myelin basic protein (MyBP); and the in vivo PknD substrate, Rv0516c. Rapamycin-induced dimerization of the phosphorylated PknD KD weakly enhanced (1.7 ± 0.4-fold) phosphorylation of MyBP, and it had little or no observable effect on activity toward Rv0516c or the PknD KD itself (Fig. 2B). An important caveat in interpreting these assays is the robust autophosphorylation of this KD during expression in E. coli.At least 14 autophosphorylation sites, including three sites in the activation loop, were detected in the PknD KD and juxtamembrane-linker regions (23Duran R. Villarino A. Bellinzoni M. Wehenkel A. Fernandez P. Boitel B. Cole S.T. Alzari P.M. Cervenansky C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because activation-loop phosphorylation is critical for activating homologous kinases, including PknB (1Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 5Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A. Falick A.M. Alber T. Nat. Struct.

Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1493-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the autophosphorylation of the KD may be sufficient to maximally stimulate the enzyme. Moreover, the lack of an increase in autophosphorylation upon dimerization may reflect the presence of nonradioactive phosphoryl groups on the majority of phosphorylation sites in the WT KD. To test the idea that PknD autophosphorylation may bypass the effects of dimerization, we measured the effects of dimerization on the activation of the unphosphorylated PknD KD. The KD fusions to FKBP and FRAP were treated with the M. tuberculosis Ser/Thr phosphatase, PstP, to remove all the phosphoryl groups on the purified proteins (15Pullen K.E. Ng H.L. Sung P.Y. Good M.C. Smith S.M. Alber T. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1947-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Duran R. Villarino A. Bellinzoni M. Wehenkel A. Fernandez P. Boitel B. Cole S.T. Alzari P.M. Cervenansky C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation reactions went to completion, as monitored by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Kinase assays were repeated after separating PstP from the dephosphorylated KD fusion proteins. As expected, dephosphorylation reduced the activity of the PknD KD on MyBP up to 9.3-fold (Fig. 2C). Because the phosphorylated KD accumulates from the initiation of the assay, the observed activity may result from autophosphorylated KD. This observation, however, established an upper limit for the intrinsic activity of the unphosphorylated PknD KD. Rapamycin-induced dimerization of the unphosphorylated KD stimulated autophosphorylation 4.2 ± 0.3-fold and increased MyBP phosphorylation 2.6 ± 0.3-fold (Fig. 2D). Using the cognate M. tuberculosis substrate protein, Rv0516c, however, a larger increase in activity (6.8 ± 1.3-fold) was observed when the KD was dimerized with rapamycin. In contrast, rapamycin had no effect on the measured activity of each fusion protein in isolation (Fig. 2E). Only when the FKBP and FRAP fusions were mixed did rapamycin induce dimerization and activation. These results suggested that dimerization strongly stimulates phosphorylation of specific, cognate substrates and has smaller effects on phosphorylation of a noncognate substrate. Moreover, these data show that dimerization may not further activate autophosphorylated kinase but rather stimulates the activity of dephosphorylated KD. Dimer Interface Mutants Influence Activity and Specificity—To pinpoint the role of back-to-back N-lobe contacts in kinase activation, we mutated two predicted dimer-interface residues to alanine and replicated the kinase assays. His-79 forms direct contacts across the dimer interface in the homologous PknE structure, and Tyr-81 is conserved in the predicted dimer interface of all PknD orthologs (Fig. 3A). Mass spectrometry revealed that autophosphorylation of the protein isolated from E. coli was reduced by the Y81A substitution and abolished by H79A (Fig. 3B and Table 1). Because autophosphorylation activates PknB and other protein kinases (1Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 5Young T.A.

First, we measured the impact of rapamycin-induced dimerization on the activities of KD fusions as isolated from E. coli (before treatment with PstP). Kinase assays were performed using the phosphorylated WT, H79A, and Y81A KD fusions purified from E. coli (Fig. 3C). The H79A mutant was inactive under all conditions in which WT kinase activity was observed (data not shown). The Y81A mutant phosphorylated the KD itself, MyBP, and Rv0516c (Fig. 3C). Like the WT protein (Fig. 2B), rapamycin-induced dimerization did not alter the activity of the autophosphorylated Y81A KD. In addition, we tested the activity of each mutant kinase after dephosphorylation. The H79A mutant was consistently inactive in all conditions tested (data not shown). Neither auto-phosphorylation nor transphosphorylation of MyBP by the Y81A mutant was observed in the presence or absence of rapamycin (Fig. 3D). Rv0516c phosphorylation, in contrast, was stimulated by rapamycin-induced dimerization (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that dimerization may preferentially activate the Y81A KD to phosphorylate cognate substrates independent of KD autophosphorylation. Allosteric Activation of WT PknD by a Catalytically Inactive Mutant—To assess whether allosteric effects transmitted through the dimer interface are sufficient to activate PknD, we produced a defined heterodimer of dephosphorylated WT PknD with an active-site mutant that renders the kinase catalytically inactive. This D138N KD mutant was 2600-fold less active than WT (16Greenstein A.E. MacGurn J.A. Baer C.E. Falick A.M. Cox J.S. Alber T. PLoS Pathogens. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), but the protein was soluble and folded in solution (data not shown). When the purified FKBP fusion of the D138N mutant (which contained no phosphoryl groups) was combined with the dephosphorylated FRAP fusion of the WT kinase, rapamycin-induced dimerization activated the WT KD in a manner analogous to the dephosphorylated WT KD homodimer (Fig. 4A). Autophosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation of MyBP increased 3.3 ± 1.1-fold and 3.7 ± 2.0-fold, respectively, in response to rapamycin-induced dimerization. Similar to the unphosphorylated WT KD, dimerization caused the largest increase (5.9 ± 0.9-fold) in the trans-phosphorylation of Rv0516c. In contrast, a mixture of the FKBP fusions (which are not brought together by rapamycin) of dephosphorylated WT and D138N variant KDs showed no stimulation by rapamycin (Fig. 4B). These results showed that a mutant lacking kinase activity nonetheless activated the WT KD by dimerization. Taken together with sequence comparisons (3Gay L.M. Ng H.L. Alber T. J. Mol.

Phosphorylation of the cognate substrate, Rv0516c, by the unphosphorylated KD showed the largest stimulation by dimer formation. The His-79 and Tyr-81 mutations, respectively, abolished or inhibited the activation of the PknD KD, suggesting that activation requires formation of a structurally specific dimer. These mutations define the location of an allosteric activation surface in PknD, which presumably also includes the other predicted dimer-interface residues conserved in PknD orthologs (Fig. 1C). The failure of rapamycin-induced dimerization to stimulate autophosphorylation and MyBP phosphorylation in the H79A and Y81A mutants (Fig. 3) indicates that activation of the WT KD results from the formation of specific intersubunit contacts, not just the proximity of monomers in the dimer. The back-to-back arrangement of the molecules in the homologous dimers, which holds the active sites of the subunits away from each other (Fig. 1A), bolsters the idea that dimerization allosterically activates the KD, rather than promoting intradimer phosphorylation. Our results support a model of PknD activation in which unphosphorylated, monomeric kinase subunits comprise the inactive state (Fig. 5A). Dimerization of the extracellular domains brings together the intracellular KDs, which promotes back-to-back dimerization and activates the kinase for auto- and trans-phosphorylation. The findings that dimerization directly activated the dephosphorylated KD (Fig. 2D) and the catalytically inactive KD activated the WT KD (Fig. 4A) provide direct support for this allosteric mechanism. The hypophosphorylation of the Y81A variant (Table 1) suggests that KD dimer formation also is required for full autophosphorylation. As seen with other STPKs (2Greenstein A.E. Grundner C. Echols N.

Duran R. Pompeo F. Cole S.T. Cervenansky C. Alzari P.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1493-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), autophosphorylation activated the PknD KD (Fig. 2C). We observed little or no further activation upon rapamycin-induced dimerization of the autophosphorylated KD (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the phosphorylated monomeric subunits may be maximally active on some substrates. Once the appropriate sites are phosphorylated, dimer formation may be less important for activity. Thus, phosphorylation provides an additional mechanism to activate the PknD KD. Consequently, our data support a model in which loss of the dimerizing signal and dephosphorylation are both required to return the activated, phosphorylated kinase to the inactive state. Consistent with the finding that a catalytically inactive mutant KD activates WT subunits in vitro (Fig. 4A), overexpression of full-length D138N PknD in M. tuberculosis increased Thr phosphorylation of specific proteins in vivo (16Greenstein A.E. MacGurn J.A. Baer C.E. Falick A.M. Cox J.S. Alber T. PLoS Pathogens. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). These phospho-Thr proteins (which are rapidly phosphorylated upon expression of full-length WT PknD) are thought to include PknD itself as well as a number of putative substrates. This seemingly paradoxical increase in phosphorylation upon expression of a catalytically inactive kinase could be an indirect effect of protein overexpression or a result of the activities of other STPKs. The specific nature of the Thr phosphorylation, however, may be best explained by activation of the endogenous WT PknD by dimerization with the excess of inactive mutant subunits in vivo. The role of dimerization in activating PknD raises the question of how general this mechanism might be. The conservation of the dimer interface in orthologs of PknD and PknB (5Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A. Falick A.M. Alber T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and the structural conservation of the back-to-back dimer in PknE (3Gay L.M. Ng H.L. Alber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) support the idea that dimerization regulates these kinases in numerous bacterial genera. Consistent with the allosteric model, M. tuberculosis PknB, PknD, PknE, PknG, and PknK all contain recognizable interaction domains fused to the KD (25Av-Gay Y. Everett M. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 238-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Moreover, a fragment comprising the transmembrane and ligand-binding domains of the B. subtilis PknB ortholog, PrkC, was sufficient to form dimers in vivo (26Madec E. Laszkiewicz A. Iwanicki A. Obuchowski M. Seror S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 571-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although several of the M. tuberculosis KDs have weak affinities (3Gay L.M. Ng H.L. Alber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), 3T. N. Lombana and T. Alber, unpublished results. this low dimer stability is suitable for membrane-tethered systems in which diffusion is two-dimensional and in which signaling ligands drive dimerization. The simple ligand-promoted dimerization mechanism (Fig. 5A), however, is unlikely to explain the activation of all the M. tuberculosis STPKs, because six of these proteins lack a ligandbinding domain with a recognizable fold or function. The predicted extracellular domains of PknA, PknF, PknH, PknI, and PknJ include sequences with low complexity, and PknL has only six amino acids predicted to occur outside the cell. Although it is possible that binding proteins may engage these extracellular domains, these latter kinases may not recognize activating ligands. Instead, they may be regulated either by trans-phosphorylation by another activated STPK or by dimerization that responds by mass action to the STPK protein concentration. The importance of a complementary dimer interface in enabling maximal phosphorylation (Fig. 3B) suggests that the STPKs that are regulated by phosphorylation may pair exclusively with kinases with similar dimer interfaces. Because of the divergence of the interface residues of the three groups of M. tuberculosis receptor STPKs (PknA/B/L, PknD/E/H, PknF/I/J) (3Gay L.M. Ng H.L. Alber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that heterodimers are formed between members of the divergent groups. These considerations support the hypothesis that these three groups of STPKs form hierarchical networks that are influenced by both the presence of extracellular signaling ligands and the concentrations of each STPK. Unless signaling ligands can bring together different sensor domains, ligand-stabilized homodimers of the receptor kinases are likely to play the roles of master STPKs at the tops of the signaling hierarchies. The allosteric activation mechanism of PknD differs from the direct intradimer cross-phosphorylation of subunits promoted by dimerization of various eukaryotic receptor tyrosine kinases (27Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3521) Google Scholar). Instead, PknD activation shares features with the allosteric regulation mechanisms of the human dsRNA-dependent PKR (7Dar A.C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2005; 122: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 8Dey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E.

Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In response to binding of dsRNA to the N-terminal ligand-binding domain, the PKR KD forms a structurally similar back-to-back symmetric dimer (Fig. 1A and Fig. 5B), which activates the kinase domains by inter-dimer phosphorylation of the activation loops (7Dar A.C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2005; 122: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 8Dey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Mutation of PKR dimer interface residues, far from the active site, resulted in a loss of activation and substrate phosphorylation (8Dey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Both KDs in the PKR dimer act simultaneously as enzymes and allosteric effectors. A similar mechanism was suggested by the dimer structure of yeast GCN2, which forms a distinct dimer through the N-terminal lobe (29Padyana A.K. Qiu H. Roll-Mecak A. Hinnebusch A.G. Burley S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29289-29299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PknD displays the added features that the unphosphorylated dimer may be active in phosphorylating a cognate substrate (Fig. 3), and the phosphorylated monomeric kinase is active (Fig. 2B). Signaling through transmembrane approximation also resembles the mechanism of activation for human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; Fig. 5C). EGF binding to the extracellular receptor domain activates the intracellular EGFR KD by favoring an asymmetric dimer in which one KD monomer stabilizes the C-helix of the other subunit in the active conformation (28Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). This association, however, involves a surface distinct from the back-to-back dimer interface in PKR (Fig. 5B) and PknD (Fig. 5A). In the EGFR asymmetric dimer, only one kinase domain is expected to be active. Despite differences between the PknD and PKR activation models, a number of similarities are apparent. Strikingly, the location of the allosteric interface is structurally conserved between PKR and the M. tuberculosis receptor kinases (Fig. 1A). In the Src tyrosine kinase, binding of Trp-260 of the linker domain to the analogous KD surface helps stabilize the inactive state (30Williams J.C. Weijland A. Gonfloni S. Thompson A. Courtneidge S.A. Superti-Furga G. Wierenga R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These similarities suggest that this region of the N-lobe distal to the active site serves as an allosteric regulatory site in a variety of protein kinases. The utilization of this interface in diverse STPKs implies that back-to-back dimerization represents a widespread allosteric regulatory mechanism. The appearance of this regulatory strategy in different kinases suggests that the mechanisms of structural communication or coupling from the allosteric surface to the active site also are likely to be preserved.

An analogous function has also been attributed to IscA, a key member of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery found in bacteria, yeast, and humans. Here we have compared the iron binding property of IscA and the frataxin ortholog CyaY from Escherichia coli under physiological and oxidative stress conditions. In the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system, which emulates the intracellular redox potential, CyaY fails to bind any iron even at a 10-fold excess of iron in the incubation solution. Under the same physiologically relevant conditions, IscA efficiently recruits iron and transfers the iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in a proposed scaffold IscU. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, however, IscA completely loses its iron binding activity, whereas CyaY becomes a competent iron-binding protein and attenuates the iron-mediated production of hydroxyl free radicals. Hydrogen peroxide appears to oxidize the iron binding thiol groups in IscA, thus blocking the iron binding in the protein. Once the oxidized thiol groups in IscA are re-reduced with the thioredoxin reductase system, the iron binding activity of IscA is fully restored. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide has no effect on the iron binding carboxyl groups in CyaY, allowing the protein to bind iron under oxidative stress conditions. The results suggest that IscA is capable of recruiting intracellular iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly under normal physiological conditions, whereas CyaY may serve as an iron chaperon to sequester redox active free iron and alleviate cellular oxidative damage under oxidative stress conditions.

Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that the primary function of IscA is to recruit intracellular free iron and deliver the iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly (44Yang J. Bitoun J.P. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27956-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the role of frataxin/CyaY and IscA in biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, here we have compared the iron binding property of IscA and CyaY from E. coli under physiological and oxidative stress conditions. The results indicate that in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system, which emulates the intracellular redox potential, CyaY, unlike IscA, fails to bind any iron even at a 10-fold excess of iron in the incubation solution. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, however, CyaY becomes a competent iron-binding protein and attenuates the iron-mediated production of hydroxyl free radicals, whereas IscA completely loses its iron binding activity. The possible physiological role of IscA and CyaY in biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters and in the intracellular iron metabolism under oxidative stresses will be discussed. Protein Preparation—The DNA fragment encoding CyaY was amplified from wild-type E. coli genomic DNA using the PCR. Two primers, CyaY-1, 5′-GATACAACCATGGACGACAGTGAA-3′, and CyaY-2, 5′-CATGCAAAGCTTGCGGAAACTGAC-3′, were used for the PCR amplification. The PCR product was digested with two restriction enzymes HindIII and NcoI and ligated into an expression vector pET28b+ as described previously (40Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cloned DNA fragment was confirmed by direct sequencing using the T7 primers. Recombinant CyaY was overproduced and purified as described previously for IscA (40Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), IscU (40Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and IscS (50Yang W. Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12868-12873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The precise molecular weight of purified CyaY was confirmed using the electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (Chemistry Department, Louisiana State University). ApoIscA and apoCyaY (proteins devoid of any iron) were prepared by incubation with l-cysteine (2 mm) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by re-purification of the protein using a HiTrap desalting column or a Mono Q column. E. coli thioredoxin-1 and thioredoxin reductase were produced from the expression vectors pDL59 (51Veine D.M. Mulrooney S.B. Wang P.F. Williams Jr., C.H. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and pTrR301 (52Mulrooney S.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), respectively, and purified as described in Ding et al. (41Ding H. Harrison K. Lu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30432-30437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The expression vectors pDL59 (51Veine D.M. Mulrooney S.B. Wang P.F. Williams Jr., C.H. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and pTrR301 (52Mulrooney S.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Scott B. Mulrooney (University of Michigan). Both thioredoxin-1 and thioredoxin reductase were purified as the native form without any tags. The purity of purified proteins was greater than 95% as judged by the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses. The concentration of apoIscA was determined using an extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 2.4 mm–1 cm–1 (40Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The concentrations of apoCyaY, apoIscU, IscS, thioredoxin-1, and thioredoxin reductase were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 30.0, 11.2, 39.7, 14.2, and 17.7 mm–1 cm–1, respectively (40Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Iron Binding Assay—For the iron binding assay, apoIscA and apoCyaY were incubated with freshly prepared Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system (thioredoxin-1 (5 μm), thioredoxin reductase (0.5 μm) and NADPH (500 μm)) in buffer containing NaCl (100 mm) and Tris (20 mm) (pH 8.0) in open-to-air microcentrifuge tubes at 37 °C for 30 min. CyaY and IscA were then re-purified from the incubation solutions using a Mono Q column as described in Yang et al. (44Yang J. Bitoun J.P. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27956-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The re-purification procedure using the Mono Q column did not significantly affect the iron binding in CyaY or IscA as >90% of the iron content in the iron-bound CyaY or IscA remained after passing through the Mono Q column. The eluted proteins from the Mono Q column were analyzed using a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The total iron content in the eluted fractions was determined using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (Department of Geology and Geophysics, Louisiana State University) or an iron indicator ferrozine as described in Yang et al. (44Yang J. Bitoun J.P. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27956-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The iron-ferrozine complex was measured at 564 nm using an extinction coefficient of 27.9 mm–1 cm–1 (53Cowart R.E. Singleton F.L. Hind J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The results from both iron analysis methods were similar to each other. Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly Assay—For the iron-sulfur cluster assembly assay, either IscA or CyaY was preincubated with apoIscU and IscS in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system in buffer containing NaCl (100 mm) and Tris (20 mm) (pH 8.0) at 37 °C. The reaction solutions were purged with pure argon gas and preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min before l-cysteine was added to initiate the iron-sulfur cluster assembly reaction. The iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU was monitored in a Beckman DU640 UV-visible absorption spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller as described previously (41Ding H. Harrison K. Lu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30432-30437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 54Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Measurements of Hydroxyl Free Radicals—The iron-mediated production of hydroxyl free radicals was measured after the procedure described by Halliwell et al. (55Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Aruoma O.I. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). Briefly, hydroxyl free radicals degrade 2-deoxyribose to form a malon-dialdehyde-like compound that reacts with thiobarbituric acid to generate a chromogen. In the experiments, apoIscA or apoCyaY was preincubated with Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 in buffer containing K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (10 mm) (pH 7.4), NaCl (60 mm), 2-deoxyribose (4 mm), and the thioredoxin reductase system at 37 °C for 10 min before hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mm) was added to initiate Fenton reaction. The reactions were continued at 37 °C for additional 25 min. A developing solution containing 1% thiobarbituric acid and 2.8% trichloroacetic acid (400 μl) was then mixed with the above incubation solutions (600 μl) and boiled for 15 min. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a desktop microcentrifuge for 15 min to remove the precipitates. The relative amounts of the chromogen in the solutions were measured from the emission at a wavelength of 553 nm using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm in a PerkinElmer LS-3 fluorescence spectrophotometer (55Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Aruoma O.I. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). Measurements of the Total Free Thiol Contents—The total free thiol contents in the protein samples were analyzed using the Ellman reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma) (56Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (at a final concentration of 100 μm) was added to the protein samples pretreated with methanol and incubated at room temperature for 20 min followed by centrifugation to remove the precipitates. The amounts of the total free thiols in the protein samples were calculated from an absorption amplitude at 412 nm using N-acetyl-l-cysteine as a standard. EPR Measurements—The EPR spectra were recorded at X-band on a Bruker ESR-300 spectrometer using an Oxford Instruments ESR-9 flow cryostat (Chemistry Department, Louisiana State University). The routine EPR conditions were: microwave frequency, 9.45 GHz; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 2.0 millitesla; sample temperature, 4.5 K; receive gain, 1.0 × 105. Iron Binding Activity of CyaY and IscA in the Presence of the Thioredoxin Reductase System—In previous studies, the frataxin ortholog CyaY and IscA from E. coli have been shown to bind iron with the iron association constants of 2.6 × 105 m–1 (13Adinolfi S.

In cells the intracellular redox potential is estimated to be in the range of –260 mV to –280 mV (57Ding H. Hidalgo E. Demple B. J. Biol.

Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To emulate the intracellular redox potential we have reconstructed the thioredoxin reductase system using E. coli thioredoxin-1 (51Veine D.M. Mulrooney S.B. Wang P.F. Williams Jr., C.H.

Here we report the molecular cloning, characterization, and homology modeling of a novel endoglycoceramidase that hydrolyzes oligogalactosylceramides to produce galactooligosaccharides and ceramides. The novel enzyme was purified from a culture supernatant of Rhodococcus equi, and the gene encoding 488 deduced amino acids was cloned using peptide sequences of the purified enzyme. Eight residues essential for the catalytic reaction in microbial and animal endoglycoceramidases were all conserved in the deduced amino acid sequence of the novel enzyme. Homology modeling of the enzyme using endocellulase E1 as a template revealed that the enzyme displays a (beta/alpha)8 barrel structure in which Glu234 at the end of beta-strand 4 and Glu341 at the end of beta-strand 7 could function as an acid/base catalyst and a nucleophile, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of these glutamates resulted in a complete loss of the activity without a change in their CD spectra. The recombinant enzyme hydrolyzed the beta-galactosidic linkage between oligosaccharides and ceramides of 6-gala series glycosphingolipids that were completely resistant to hydrolysis by the enzymes reported so far. In contrast, the novel enzyme did not hydrolyze ganglio-, globo-, or lactoseries glycosphingolipids. The enzyme is therefore systematically named oligogalactosyl-N-acylsphingosine 1,1'-beta-galactohydrolase or tentatively designated endogalactosylceramidase."
https://openalex.org/W2089345261,"Transcription of a number of mammalian genes is activated by heavy metals, but mechanisms of signaling and transcriptional regulation are not well understood. From a comparison of heavy metal responses of several human genes, it was noted that the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene is quite similar in the spectrum of metal response and induction kinetics to the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism shared by these genes. The cadmium-responsive element (CdRE) known to be responsible for the metal regulation of ho-1 formed complexes with proteins from heavy metal-treated HeLa cells in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). These complexes were indistinguishable in mobility from those formed by the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and the heat shock element involved in hsp70 regulation, suggesting the involvement of HSF1 also in the CdRE complexes. Competitive EMSA and supershift analysis with an anti-HSF1 antibody revealed that HSF1 was in fact a component of the CdRE complexes. A fine analysis on the affinity of HSF1 to a series of mutant CdRE sequences showed that HSF1 recognizes a sequence motif TnCTAGA. Transient transfection analysis with overexpressed recombinant HSF1 demonstrated that CdRE has HSF1-dependent enhancer-like activity that requires direct binding of HSF1. In the absence of overexpressed HSF1, however, CdRE by itself was insufficient to mediate heavy metal-induced transcription, suggesting requirement of additional regulatory sequences.

J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49246-49253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but its relationship with the CdRE-mediated transcriptional activation is unclear. In the heavy metal induction of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene, it has been suggested that a signal from cadmium is mediated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and its recognition site heat shock element (HSE) (3Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell.

Metal responses mediated by HSE and MRE have been considered to be independent of each other (10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Saydam N. Steiner F. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31879-31883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but recently a cross-talk of these two pathways has been suggested (15Uenishi R. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In an attempt to obtain a comprehensive view in heavy metal responses of human genes, we have been studying on transcriptome modulated by heavy metals (16Yamada H. Koizumi S. Ind. Health. 2002; 40: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the regulatory mechanisms of several metal-inducible genes as well as their interrelationships (10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Uenishi R. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the latter study, human hsp70-1a (indicated as hsp70 hereafter), MT-2A, and c-fos showed differential responses to heavy metals, suggesting no direct relationship among their mechanisms of induction (10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, we noted that a pair of genes, namely human ho-1 and hsp70, exhibited closely similar metal responses. In the present work, we studied whether these two genes share a common molecular mechanism in heavy metal-induced transcriptional activation. Cell Culture—HeLa S3 cells (CCL 2.2) were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% calf serum under 5% CO2 atmosphere. In experiments, streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and penicillin (100 units/ml) were added to the medium. Northern Blotting—A digoxigenin-labeled probe specific to ho-1 was prepared as follows. An 847-bp SphI fragment containing most of human ho-1 coding region was cut out of a plasmid pHHO1 (a generous gift from Prof. S. Shibahara), blunt-ended, and cloned between blunt-ended EcoRI and PstI sites of a plasmid pSPT18 (Roche Applied Science). Using the resultant plasmid as a template, a digoxigenin-labeled ho-1-specific RNA probe was synthesized in vitro as previously described (10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was carried out as described (10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were inoculated in 60-mm Falcon plastic dish (106 cells/4 ml of medium) and cultured for 3 days. Cells in duplicates were incubated with or without heavy metals for 4 h before harvest. Total RNA was extracted from the cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method. RNAs were electrophoresed in formaldehyde-1% agarose gel, transferred to charged nylon membrane, and UV-cross-linked. The ho-1 mRNA was detected with the digoxigenin-labeled specific RNA probe. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Supershift Assay—Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared from HeLa cells as previously described (10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed with the WCE and 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes as reported (10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of synthetic oligonucleotide probes and competitors used are shown in Figs. 2a and 5, a and b. In supershift assay, 1 μl of antibody solution was added to EMSA reaction mixtures after binding reaction, followed by incubation at 25 °C for 20 min prior to electrophoresis. Antibodies used were a rabbit anti-human MTF-1 antibody (15Uenishi R. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a rabbit anti-human HSF1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents), and a rabbit anti-human Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For all results, reproducibility was confirmed by repeated experiments. The anti-MTF-1 antibody had been raised against a 19-amino acid synthetic peptide and affinity-purified (15Uenishi R. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the anti-HSF1 antibody was polyclonal antiserum raised against a whole molecule of recombinant HSF1. Such different properties of the antibodies appeared to result in a striking difference in the size of supershifted complex.FIGURE 5Identification of bases essential for HSF1-CdRE interaction. a, competitive EMSA with a series of mutant CdRE competitors with consecutive 3-base mutations.

Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Health Sci. 2005; 51: 242-247Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The latter retains HSE located between –105 and –91. Another variant pΔ(–76)CAT was constructed as follows. A plasmid pHSP70pr that carries hsp70 sequence (from –270 to +156) was reported previously (17Uenishi R. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Health Sci. 2005; 51: 242-247Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this construct, a KpnI site had been introduced just 5′ of the hsp70 sequence, and a native BamHI site is present at its 3′ end. A DNA fragment was amplified by PCR with pHSP70pr as a template and the following primer pair: 5′-TGGGTACCAGATCTAGCTCGGTGATTGGCTCAGAAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCTCAGGCTAGCCGTTATCCG-3′ (reverse). The forward primer carries KpnI and BglII sites followed by hsp70 promoter sequence between –76 and –54. The reverse primer carries the NheI site and flanking sequences that are located just downstream from TIS of hsp70. The resultant PCR product was digested with KpnI and NheI, yielding a fragment containing hsp70 sequence form –76 to +7. A KpnI/NheI fragment from the original pHSP70pr containing hsp70 sequence from –270 to +7 was replaced with the amplified truncated fragment, generating pΔ(–76) that lacks HSE but retains the promoter sequence up to –76. The KpnI/BamHI fragment from pΔ(–76) was cloned between the KpnI and BglII sites in the multicloning site of pCAT3 Basic (Promega) to place CAT reporter gene under the control of the truncated hsp70 promoter, generating pΔ(–76)CAT. Double-stranded oligonucleotides each containing the HSE or CdRE sequence with flanking 5′-BamHI and 3′-BglII sites were prepared; their sequences are as follows (only the upper strand sequences are shown; the flanking restriction enzyme sites are indicated by lowercase letters): HSE, 5′-gatccAACCCCTGGAATATTCCCGACCTGGCAGCCa-3′; CdRE, 5′-gatccAGGCGGATTTTGCTAGATTTTGCTGAGTCAa-3′. These oligonucleotides were inserted into the BglII site of pΔ(–76)CAT (just upstream of hsp70 promoter sequence) to generate p(HSE)CAT, p(CdRE)CAT and p(CdREr)CAT where the superscript “r” stands for reverse orientation. In p(HSE)CAT, HSE was placed exactly at the same position as native HSE relative to TIS. The double-stranded CdRE oligonucleotide was also inserted into the BamHI site located downstream of the CAT reporter gene to generate p(3′-CdRE)CAT and p(3′-CdREr)CAT. Mutant CdRE oligonucleotides with base substitutions corresponding to the mutants c, d, and g in Fig. 5b were also inserted into the BglII site of pΔ(–76)CAT, generating p(mut-c)CAT, p(mut-d)CAT, and p(mut-g)CAT, respectively. For all constructs, DNA sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. A reference plasmid pRSV-βGal expresses β-galactosidase (βGal) under the control of Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter (15Uenishi R. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A HSF1 expression vector pCI-HSF1 expresses human HSF1 under the control of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early gene enhancer/promoter (17Uenishi R. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Health Sci. 2005; 51: 242-247Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For transient transfection assays, plasmid DNAs were purified using Qiagen plasmid maxi kit. Transient Transfection Assay—HeLa S3 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/2 ml medium/35-mm Falcon plastic dish. After a 24-h incubation, cells were transfected with reporter, reference, and expression plasmids according to a standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol. Control cells without an expression vector were transfected with an equimolar amount of empty vector pCI (Promega). The amount of DNA to be transfected was adjusted to be 2 μg/dish in total by adding pUC19 if necessary. After appropriate treatments, CAT and βGal levels in cell extracts were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Roche Applied Science). CAT expression levels were normalized relative to βGal expression levels. Human ho-1 and hsp70 Genes Show Similar Heavy Metal Responses—The responses of human ho-1 gene expression to several heavy metals were examined in HeLa S3 cells. The results of Northern blot analysis are shown in Fig. 1a. ho-1 was responsive to various metal salts including ZnSO4, CdSO4, CuSO4, AgNO3, and HgCl2. We noticed that the metal response of ho-1 was quite similar to that of hsp70 observed in our earlier study (10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the dose-response curves of ho-1 expression in cells exposed to these metals, mRNA accumulation up to maximal induction was very similar in both genes (Fig. 1a; compare with hsp70 curves represented by broken lines). At higher metal concentrations, ho-1 mRNA levels decreased more sharply, in contrast to hsp70 mRNA levels that were sustained. For zinc and cadmium, time course of ho-1 induction was also examined at concentrations that induced maximal responses, i.e. at 200 and 5 μm, respectively (Fig. 1b). Time-dependent changes of ho-1 mRNA accumulation in response to both metals were quite similar to those of hsp70 mRNA. Such a high extent of similarity in induction kinetics suggested that a common mechanism of transcriptional activation might be shared by these two genes. HSF1 Specifically Binds to CdRE—It has been suggested that the metal response of hsp70 is mediated by a transcription factor HSF1 which plays a primary role in transcriptional activation of hsp genes by heat shock. DNA binding activity of human HSF1 is activated by metal exposure, and the activated protein binds to HSE located ∼100 bp upstream from TIS (10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that CdRE located ∼4 kbp upstream from TIS of human ho-1 mediates cadmium response of the gene (2Takeda K. Ishizawa S. Sato M. Yoshida T. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22858-22867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By EMSA with HSE and CdRE probes indicated in Fig. 2a, we analyzed HeLa cell extracts for protein factors that specifically recognize HSE or CdRE. As reported previously (10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), indistinct HSE binding activities, which probably represent HSF1, were induced in WCE from cells exposed to zinc, cadmium, silver, or heat shock (Fig. 2b, lanes 2–5, respectively; compare with control in lane 1). CdRE binding activities were also observed to be induced by these heavy metals as well as heat shock (lanes 7–10). Surprisingly, these CdRE-protein complexes were indistinguishable in mobility with the HSE-protein complexes, although signals were less intense. From these results, it seemed likely that the CdRE-binding protein is HSF1. Specificity of sequence recognition by the HSE or CdRE binding activity was analyzed by competitive EMSA (Fig. 3). In an assay with WCE from zinc-exposed cells and 32P-HSE probe (Fig. 3a), the 32P complexes were competed out by unlabeled HSE oligonucleotide in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2–4; compare with control without competitor in lane 1). Unlabeled CdRE oligonucleotide was observed to be also competitive, although less efficient than the HSE competitor (lanes 5–7). By contrast, no competition was observed with oligonucleotide competitors containing MRE (lanes 8–10) or GC box (lanes 11–13), the recognition sequences of transcription factors MTF-1 and Sp1, respectively. In another assay with 32P-CdRE probe (Fig. 3b), the 32P complexes were competed out by the CdRE oligonucleotide (lanes 2–4) and also by the HSE oligonucleotide more efficiently (lanes 5–7). MRE (lanes 8–10) and GC oligonucleotides (lanes 11–13) again showed no effect. From these results, an identical protein, probably HSF1, appears to recognize both HSE and CdRE but with higher affinity to HSE. To identify the CdRE-binding protein, zinc-induced protein-DNA complexes were further analyzed by supershift assays with specific antibodies (Fig. 4a). When an EMSA binding reaction mixture with 32P-HSE probe was incubated with an anti-HSF1 antibody prior to electrophoresis, the HSE complexes were supershifted, indicating the formation of a huge complex electrophoresed only a small distance into gel (lane 3; compare with control without antibody in lane 1). The CdRE complexes were also supershifted by this antibody exactly in the same manner (lane 7; compare with control without antibody in lane 5). These results strongly suggested that HSF-1 was contained in the CdRE complexes. We have previously reported possible involvement of MTF-1 in the HSF1-HSE complexes (15Uenishi R. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An anti-MTF-1 antibody raised against a synthetic peptide containing a part of MTF1 sequence supershifted the CdRE complexes (lane 6) as well as the HSE complexes (lane 2), suggesting that MTF-1 is also contained in the CdRE complexes. An anti-Sp1 antibody used as a negative control supershifted neither HSE complexes (lane 4) nor CdRE complexes (lane 8), verifying specific supershift by anti-HSF1 and anti-MTF-1 antibodies. CdRE complexes induced by cadmium, silver, and heat shock (Fig. 4b, lanes 6, 8, and 10; compare with controls without a specific antibody in lanes 5, 7, and 9, respectively) were supershifted in the same manner as zinc (lane 4) by the anti-HSF1 antibody, indicating the involvement of HSF in any of these complexes. From these data, it is likely that heavy metal exposure activates HSF1 to be able to bind CdRE, through which HSF1 plays a role in the heavy metal regulation of ho-1. Nucleotides Required for the Recognition of CdRE by HSF1—Bases essential for the recognition of CdRE by HSF1 were examined by competitive EMSA using various mutant CdRE oligonucleotides as unlabeled competitors (Fig. 5). When a series of mutants with substitutions in three consecutive bases was used as competitors (Fig. 5a), mutant 3 (lanes 8 and 9) and mutant 4(lanes 10 and 11) that had substitutions at the center of the CdRE sequence CTAGAT lost the ability to competitively inhibit CdRE complex formation (compare with controls of the wild type CdRE competitor in lanes 2 and 3), indicating that these bases are particularly important. Decreased competition was observed for mutant 2 (lanes 6 and 7) and mutant 5 (lanes 12 and 13), which had substitutions next to the central bases. Mutant 1 (lanes 4 and 5) and mutant 6 (lanes 14 and 15) showed no effect. We then tested another series of CdRE mutant competitors, each of which had a single base change within the sequence TTGCTAGATTTT found to be important in Fig. 5a. As shown in Fig. 5b, the ability to compete with CdRE was lost in mutants d, e, f, g, and h (lanes 6–10) and was decreased in mutant b (lane 4) relative to wild type CdRE (lane 2). Other base changes did not affect HSF1 binding. The results of Fig. 5, a and b, are summarized in Fig. 5c. In conclusion, the base sequence essential for HSF1 binding is TnCTAGA. CdRE Mediates HSF1-dependent Transcription—We next examined whether CdRE mediates transcriptional activation in a HSF1-dependent manner by transient transfection analysis. First, we attempted to establish an assay system that can detect heavy metal-induced transcription, using the regulatory region of hsp70 that has a functional HSE and is known to be responsive to cadmium through HSF1-HSE interaction (3Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We avoided using the widely used luciferase gene in this assay, since we have noted that luciferase enzyme activity used as a reporter is often affected by heavy metals, leading to misinterpretation of data. Alternatively, we have verified that the determination of CAT or βGal levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which was adopted in the present work, can circumvent this difficulty. 4S. Koizumi and K. Suzuki, unpublished observation. A plasmid construct that carries hsp70 upstream sequence linked to CAT reporter gene (pHSP70prCAT; indicated at the top of Fig. 6) was used as a reporter plasmid. As a reference plasmid, pRSV-βGal that expresses βGal was used. Levels of the reporter gene expression were determined after exposure to 100–300 μm ZnSO4 or 10–50 μm CdSO4 (Fig. 6). Increased expression of the reporter gene in a manner dependent on heavy metal concentrations was observed for both metals, demonstrating that this assay can successfully detect metal response. We then tested variants of pHSP70prCAT that retained or lacked HSE located between –105 and –91 to examine whether HSE-dependent transcription is detectable. In a deletion mutant pΔ(–112)CAT, the 5′-flanking region of hsp70 from –113 to –270 was deleted, but HSE was retained. In another mutant pΔ(–76)CAT, the 5′-flanking region of hsp70 from –77 to –270 including HSE was deleted. We estimated reporter expression from these constructs by the transfection assay described above, but only low levels of activity were detected, whether HSE was retained or not (data not shown). This may indicate that the retained HSE is insufficient for mediating metal-responsive transcription. However, we found that HSE-dependent transcription was detectable under a different assay condition, that is, in the presence of overexpressed recombinant HSF1. Co-transfection of a HSF1 expression vector markedly enhanced basal level activity of pHSP70prCAT and almost abolished metal response (Fig. 7). Such an effect of HSF1 overexpression has also been observed in induction by zinc (17Uenishi R. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Health Sci. 2005; 51: 242-247Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), probably due to titrating out negative regulators of HSF1 such as HSP90 and HSP70 (18Ali A. Bharadwaj S. O'Carroll R. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Under this condition, pΔ(–112)CAT retaining HSE showed obvious reporter expression, in contrast to pΔ(–76)CAT lacking HSE which had almost no activity (Fig. 7). These results indicated that this assay was useful to detect HSF1-dependent transcriptional activity. Next we constructed two reporter plasmids based on pΔ(–76)CAT, p(HSE)CAT and p(CdRE)CAT, in which a synthetic oligonucleotide containing HSE or CdRE sequence was inserted just upstream of the regulatory sequence of pΔ(–76)CAT, respectively (Fig. 7). The former had HSE placed at exactly the same distance from TIS as native HSE and served as a positive control for p(CdRE)CAT in which the HSE sequence was replaced with CdRE sequence. Activity similar to that of pΔ(–112)CAT was observed for p(HSE)CAT. Expression from p(CdRE)CAT was also evident, even a little higher than that from p(HSE)CAT. These findings demonstrated that CdRE can mediate HSF1-dependent transcription. In the absence of overexpressed HSF1, only a background level of activity was observed for p(HSE)CAT or p(CdRE)CAT (data not shown). To examine whether the HSF1-dependent transcriptional activity of CdRE requires direct binding of HSF1 to it, reporter plasmids carrying mutant CdREs were assayed (Fig. 8). The CdRE sequence in p(CdRE)CAT was replaced with mutant CdREs each with a base substitution corresponding to mutant c, d, or g shown in Fig. 5b: mutant c can bind HSF1 just like wild type CdRE, while mutants d and g cannot. Reporter plasmids with CdRE competent for HSF1 binding, i.e. wild type CdRE and mutant c, showed high reporter expression. By contrast, reporter activity was markedly decreased to near the background level in mutants d and g that do not bind HSF1, suggesting that direct binding of HSF1 to CdRE is essential for transcriptional activation. To examine whether the activity of CdRE depends on orientation or location, several additional reporter plasmids were constructed and tested for expression (Fig. 9). The CdRE sequence was inserted in a reverse orientation relative to that in p(CdRE)CAT, generating p(CdREr) CAT. This plasmid showed an activity comparative with p(CdRE)CAT. Alternatively, CdRE was inserted just 3′ of the reporter gene in the normal or reverse orientation, yielding p(3′-CdRE) CAT and p(3′-CdREr) CAT, respectively. These plasmid showed low but significant reporter expression (2.5–3-fold over the background level) as compared with control pΔ(–76)CAT, regardless of orientation. These results confirmed that CdRE possesses a HSF1-dependent enhancer-like activity. CdRE is a regulatory DNA element located in the upstream region of human ho-1 and has been reported to mediate cadmium-induced transcriptional activation (2Takeda K. Ishizawa S. Sato M. Yoshida T. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22858-22867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although metal response via CdRE appears to be an excellent model for studying biological responses to metals, its mechanistic background has not been well characterized. In the present study, we showed that (a) HSF1, which plays an essential role in heat shock response of hsp genes, is activated by several heavy metals to be competent for DNA binding, (b) activated HSF1 specifically binds to CdRE, (c) CdRE mediates activation of transcription from a downstream promoter in the presence of overexpressed HSF1, and (d) this activation requires direct binding of HSF1 to CdRE and can also be mediated by CdRE placed in a reverse orientation or from a distance. The similarity in the heavy metal response observed between hsp70 and ho-1 might reflect the interaction of upstream regulatory elements with a common regulator HSF1. The finding that HSF1 is directly involved in the regulation of ho-1, which plays an important role in protection against oxidative stress (20Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), revealed an unexpected cross talk in the regulation of heavy metal-inducible genes, a new aspect of the biological defense system. The nucleotide sequence of CdRE, TGCTAGATTTT, as well as the bases recognized by HSF1, TnCTAGA, appears to be unrelated with the typical HSE sequence. However, the sequence of CdRE and flanking regions, GGATT-TTGCT-AGATT-TTGCT, is composed of four inverted pentanucleotide repeats similar to the conserved nGAAn units in HSE (Ref. 3Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; units are indicated by separating with hyphens; bases recognized by HSF1 are underlined). In each unit, the second base (G of nGAAn) is conserved. Mutations that abolished HSF1 binding are located in the central two units, which are expected to be indispensable for binding of an active HSF1 trimer. Based on this consideration, CdRE may be regarded as a variant of HSE. Nevertheless, the central TA in the TnCTAGA sequence are most important for HSF1 binding from our results, despite of the fact that the two bases correspond to non-conserved bases in the HSE consensus. Therefore it remains unclear whether HSF1 interacts with CdRE exactly in the same manner as with HSE. CdRE showed lower affinity to HSF1 in EMSA (Fig. 3), while exhibited higher activity in the transfection assay (Fig. 7), than HSE. These findings may possibly reflect a differential contact of HSF1 and CdRE, which would affect the conformation of the HSF1 molecule and subsequent interaction with other regulatory proteins such as coactivators. As described above, CdRE binding activity of HSF1 is induced in the extracts of heavy metal-treated cells, and CdRE displays a HSF1-dependent enhancer-like activity. These findings make us imagine that binding of metal-activated HSF1 to CdRE is involved in the mechanism of transcriptional activation of ho-1. However, CdRE by itself was not sufficient for transcriptional activation in vivo. In our transient transfection assay, CdRE exhibited an obvious transcriptional activity only in the presence of overexpressed HSF1, whereas not in its absence, namely in transcription utilizing only the endogenous HSF1. Without exogenous HSF1, our transfection assay can detect heavy metal-induced transcription from hsp70 promoter, for which the interaction of HSF1 and an upstream HSE is critical (3Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10Murata M. Gong P. Suzuki K. Koizumi S. J. Cell.

Therefore at least in transcription directed by the 5′-flanking sequence of hsp70, activation, nuclear translocation, and binding to HSE of the endogenous HSF1 must occur. The fact that the isolated CdRE sequence was not functional under the same condition indicates that CdRE by itself is insufficient for mediating metal-induced transcription, and additional regulatory sequences might be required for CdRE to be fully functional. Although HSF1 showed an obvious CdRE binding activity in EMSA, the protein-DNA interaction may not be stable enough in vivo, and the weak interaction might be compensated only by a high concentration of HSF1. Based on the findings described above, it seems important to identify sequences that cooperate with CdRE to achieve full activity. It has been reported that STAT-1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-1) that bind to a region near the HSF1 binding site cooperates with HSF1 via direct protein-protein interaction to produce strong transcriptional activation (21Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A. Nakajima K. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Such a regulator binding site near CdRE is a possible candidate for the additional sequence to assist CdRE function. In this context, it is of interest that a Maf recognition element (MARE) is located just adjacent to CdRE (22Kitamuro T. Takahashi K. Ogawa K. Udono-Fujimori R. Takeda K. Furuyama K. Nakayama M.

It has been suggested that nuclear export of a negative regulator Bach1 that binds to MARE is involved in cadmium-induced transcriptional activation of human ho-1 (12Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Sun J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49246-49253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), although it is not clear whether the MARE next to CdRE is directly concerned in such a regulation. In addition, it has recently been reported that a nucleolar protein pescadillo regulates transcription of ho-1 through binding to CdRE in renal cells (11Sikorski E.M. Uo T. Morrison R.S. Agarwal A.

This protein is an additional new member to be studied in the regulation of ho-1 via the CdRE/MARE region. Possible cooperation between CdRE and additional sequences including MARE, as well as the interaction of proteins binding to them, is now under investigation. We thank Dr. S.

https://openalex.org/W1986909653,"Despite the ability of most proteins to form amyloid, very little is know about amyloid fibril structures and the factors that govern their stability. Using amyloid fibrils produced from full-length prion protein (PrP), we describe a reliable approach for determining both site-specific and global conformational stability of the fibrillar form. To measure site-specific stability, we produced six variants of PrP by replacing the residues at positions 88, 98, 127, 144, 196, and 230 with cysteine, labeled the new cysteines with the fluorescent dye acrylodan, and investigated their conformational status within the amyloid form in guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation experiments. We found that the fibrils labeled at positions 127, 144, 196, and 230 displayed cooperative unfolding and showed a very high C½ value similar to that observed for the global unfolding of the amyloid structure. The unfolding at residue 98 was also cooperative; however, it showed a C½ value substantially lower than that of global unfolding, whereas the unfolding of fibrils labeled at residue 88 was non-cooperative. These data illustrate that there are at least two independent cooperative folding domains within the amyloid structure of the full-length PrP. In addition, kinetic experiments revealed only a partial overlap between the region that constituted the fibrillar cross-β core and the regions that were involved in nucleation. This result illustrates that separate PrP regions accounted for the nucleation and for the formation of the conformationally most stable fibrillar core.

Besides the native globular shape, the vast majority of proteins and peptides are capable of forming alternative, well defined structures with a specific cross-β sheet fold referred to as amyloid fibrils (1Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). In contrast to native folds, however, amyloid fibrils display high conformational stability and unusual mechanical properties. Because of their peculiar properties, amyloid structures have been exploited in nature for a variety of physiological functions. For example, the major structural component of the shells of many insects and fish is made of amyloid that protects developing embryos from mechanical pressure, dehydration, and proteolytic digestion (2Iconomidou V.A. Vriend G. Hamodrakas K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Podrabsky J.E. Carpenter J.E. Hand S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: R123-R131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another example of naturally occurring amyloid includes the extracellular curly fibrils produced by Escherichia coli that enable the bacteria to colonize a surface (4Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S.

Mammalian cells utilize amyloid structures made of Pmel17 protein for the biogenesis of melanin (5Fowler D.M. Koulov A.V. Alory-Jost C. Marks M.S. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: 100-107Crossref Scopus (685) Google Scholar). These findings illustrate that that amyloid formation is an evolutionarily preserved biological pathway used to produce natural biomaterials with extraordinary physical properties and important physiological functions. For the same reasons that amyloid fibrils are exploited in nature to fulfill certain functions, they could be detrimental to human health. Because of their high conformational and kinetic stability, fibrillar deposits can accumulate inside or outside of cells and initiate pathological processes leading to neurodegenerative or systemic diseases (6Carrell R.W.

High resistance to temperature or solvent-induced denaturation and to proteolytic digestion enables fibrils of the prion protein to transmit prion diseases (8Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.-O. B.

Remarkably, different isolates or strains of the disease-specific fibrillar form of PrP 5The abbreviations used are: PrP, full-length recombinant prion protein; PrPC, cellular isoform of the prion protein; PrPSc, disease associated isoform of the prion protein; WT, wild type; PK, proteinase K; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ThT, thioflavin T; FTIR, fourier transform infrared. (PrPSc) exhibit substantial differences in conformational stability, an important physical property that appears to be tightly linked to neuropathological features and incubation time of prion disease (11Peretz D.

Interspecies transmission of prions was found accompanied by a change in conformational stability and disease phenotype, leading to the emergence of new prion strain (12Peretz D. Williamson R.A.

Recent studies of yeast prion protein Sup35 reveal a strong link between conformational stability and the intrinsic infectivity of fibrils generated in vitro (16Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 6980: 323-328Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Regardless of whether amyloid structures are involved in normal function or associated with pathological processes, the physical properties of fibrils such as conformational stability appear to determine to a large extent their biological effects. In contrast to the native state, surprisingly little is known about physical properties of amyloid structures or factors that determine their conformational stability. Because individual polypeptides are able to form conformationally different fibrils, both amino acid sequence and folding conditions should impact the final fibrillar structure (17Petkova A.T. Leapman R.D. Gua Z. Yau W.-M. Mattson M.P. Tycko R. Science. 2005; 307: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). Lack of well developed physical approaches together with insolubility and heterogeneity of amyloid fibrils have imposed substantial difficulties in elucidating their conformational properties. In the present study, we have described a reliable approach for elucidating the global and site-specific conformational stability of amyloid fibrils. We employed this method to elucidate the conformation of fibrils produced from the full-length mouse PrP. Our approach consists of several steps including (i) generating individual Cys-PrP variants; (ii) labeling of individual Cys-PrP variants with the fluorescent probe acrylodan; (iii) conversion of Cys-PrP variants into amyloid fibrils; and (iv) measuring GdnHCl-induced denaturation using acrylodan fluorescence. We found that within the amyloid fibrillar structure, PrP polypeptides adopt two independent folding domains. These domains are characterized by different C½ values in GdnHCl-induced denaturation. The denaturation profile of the most stable domain was superimposable with the global unfolding of amyloid structure. This domain appears to form cross-β-sheet fibrillar core, whereas the less stable domain might be responsible for forming interfaces between filaments. The kinetics of fibril formation revealed that residues 88, 98, 196, and 230 play more prominent roles in nucleation than residues 127 or 144. Our studies established a new technique for studying amyloid fibrils and provided an important new insight into the substructure of PrP fibrils. Expression and Purification of Cys-PrP Variants—W88C, W98C, Y127C, W144C, N196C, and S230C point mutations were introduced into the mouse PrP23–230 gene using the QuikChange procedure, and the results were verified by sequencing. WT and Cys-PrP variants DNA in pET101/DTOPO vector (Invitrogen) were transfected into BL21(DE3) Star cells (Invitrogen). Cys-PrP variants were expressed and purified as described previously (18Breydo L. Bocharova O.V. Makarava N. Salnikov V.V. Anderson M. Baskakov I.V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15534-15543Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After gel filtration, the fractions containing PrP (∼0.3 mg/ml in 6 m urea, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) were supplemented with EGTA and l-cystine (to final concentrations of 5 and 0.2 mm, respectively), incubated at 23 °C for 1 h, and dialyzed against 3 m urea, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm l-cystine, pH 7.5, overnight to achieve formation of a native disulfide bond. All subsequent steps were as described previously (18Breydo L. Bocharova O.V. Makarava N. Salnikov V.V. Anderson M. Baskakov I.V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15534-15543Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The purified Cys-PrP variants were confirmed by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1a) and electrospray mass spectrometry to be a single species with an intact disulfide bond and correct molecular weight. Labeling of PrP with Acrylodan—A typical labeling reaction consisted of mixing the Cys-PrP variant (1 mg/ml, 42 μm, 300 μl) with ammonium acetate (1 m, pH 7.0, 3 μl), Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (5 mm in water, 5 μl, 2 eq), and acrylodan (50 mm in Me2SO, 5 μl, 25 eq) and then incubation for 2 h at 23°C, addition of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (5 mm, 2.5 μl), and incubation for another 4 h. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 8 min, and the supernatant was purified by HPLC (Symmetry 300 C4, 4.6×250 mm; Waters Corp.; eluant gradient consisted of 1 → 60% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The typical yield of product was ∼180 μg (60%). The identity and purity of the acrylodan-labeled protein was verified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE, and the native conformation was confirmed by CD (supplemental Fig. 1b). Conversion of PrP into Amyloid Fibrils and Measurement of the Kinetics of Fibrilization—To form amyloid fibrils, the stock solution of WT PrP (3 mg/ml in 6 m GdnHCl) was mixed with a solution of freshly prepared acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrP variant at a molar ratio of 9:1 and diluted to a final total protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml in 50 mm MES buffer, 2 m GdnHCl, pH 6.0. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C in with continuous shaking at 600 rpm as described previously (19Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The kinetics of fibril formation was monitored simultaneously using acrylodan florescence and ThT binding assays. Aliquots withdrawn during the time course of incubation at 37 °C were diluted with 5 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) to a final PrP concentration of 0.3 μm. For monitoring acrylodan fluorescence, two emission spectra (from 380 to 600 nm) were recorded for each sample in 0.4-cm rectangular cuvettes with an excitation at 370 nm using a Flurmax-3 fluorometer (Jobin Yvon) with both excitation and emission slits 3 nm and averaged. Then ThT was added to the same sample to a final concentration of 10 μm, and ThT florescence was measured as previous described. FTIR spectroscopy and electron microscopy of amyloid fibrils were performed as described previously (18Breydo L. Bocharova O.V. Makarava N. Salnikov V.V. Anderson M. Baskakov I.V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15534-15543Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Determining Site-specific Conformational Stability—To determine the site-specific conformational stability, the fibrils produced from mixtures of WT and acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrP variants were diluted to a final PrP concentration of 6.9 μg/ml (equivalent of 0.3 μm) and incubated for 1 h in solutions containing different concentrations of GdnHCl (from 0 to 7 m GdnHCl, in 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.0) at 23 °C. The acrylodan emission spectra were recorded as described earlier. Determining Global Stability—The fibrils produced from mixtures of WT and acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrP (7 μl, 0.25 mg/ml) were suspended in MES (30 μl, 100 mm, pH 6.0) containing different concentrations of GdnHCl. The solution was incubated for 1 h at 23 °C and then diluted to 300 μl with 9 m GdnHCl and water to adjust the final concentration of GdnHCl to 0.55 m. Fluorescence spectra were recorded in the presence of 10 μm ThT as previous described. Generating Cys Variants of PrP—To determine the specific positions for Cys substitutions, we used several criteria. First, we avoided replacing the residues that are known to be “functionally” important for PrPSc propagation, such as the residues involved in the dominant-negative effect (20Kaneko K. Zulianello L. Scott M. Cooper C.M. Wallace A.C. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10069-10074Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), the residues that account for the species-species barrier, or those associated with familial forms of prion disease (21Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 139-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Second, because we wanted to minimize the possible perturbation effects of the acrylodan-labeled Cys on fibrillar conformation, we replaced the bulky amino acid residues, such as tryptophans at positions 88, 98, or 144, tyrosine at 127, or asparagine at 196. We also replaced serine at position 230. Because in PrPC glycans and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor are attached to asparagine 196 and serine 230, respectively, we assumed that labeling PrP at these residues should have minimal steric impact on fibril formation. To date, we have produced six PrP variants: W88C, W98C, Y127C, W144C, N196C, and S230C. All six Cys variants were expressed and purified to homogeneity using the protocols developed for WT PrP (19Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Gill A.C. Baskakov I.V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), with some minor modifications as specified under “Experimental Procedures” (supplemental Fig. 1a). We took special precaution with respect to the formation of the proper disulfide bonds in Cys-PrP variants by performing oxidative refolding in partially denaturing conditions (3 m urea; 100 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm l-cystine, pH 7.5, overnight incubation). In the presence of 3 m urea, the native α-helical conformation is still stable and favors formation of the proper disulfide bridge while precluding formation of the non-native disulfide bridges. The oxidative refolding was followed by a reverse-phase HPLC, by which correctly folded α-helical PrP monomers were separated from incorrectly folded PrP species including those with non-native disulfide bonds. All six Cys-PrP variants were labeled with acrylodan; the reaction mixture was purified again by HPLC to separate labeled and unlabeled PrP molecules (“Experimental Procedures”) (supplemental Fig. 1b). Acrylodan offers several advantages as a fluorescence probe such as high photostability, high sensitivity to the solvent environment, and a relatively low molecular weight (similar to that of tryptophan). This dye has been used successfully for studying conformational properties of amyloid fibrils produced from the yeast prion Sup35 (23Krishnan R. Lindquist S. Nature. 2005; 435: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Converting Cys Variants into Fibrillar Form—To form amyloid fibrils from the Cys-PrP variants, we use the protocol previously developed in our laboratory (shaking at 2 m GdnHCl, pH 6.0) (19Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 24Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6776-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In producing fibrils, it was important to make sure that the Cys substitutions and subsequent labeling with acrylodan did not alter the conformational properties of the fibrillar form. To minimize a possible perturbation effect, we used 9:1 molar mixtures of WT PrP and acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrP variants for the conversion reactions. To test whether acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrP affected physical properties of fibrils, we employed a proteinase K digestion assay for assessing the PK-resistant core, FTIR spectroscopy for evaluating possible perturbations in secondary structure, and electron microscopy for confirming fibrillar morphology. The PK digestion assay showed that the fibrils produced from the mixtures of six different Cys-PrP variants and WT PrP had a PK-resistant core identical to that of WT fibrils (supplemental Fig. 2). FTIR spectroscopy revealed identical secondary structure in WT PrP fibrils and in fibrils produced from the mixtures of WT and Cys-PrP variants (supplemental Fig. 3). The second derivatives of FTIR spectra showed two major peaks at 1616 and 1626 cm-1 that correspond to β-sheets in all samples and a peak at 1662 cm-1 that corresponds to β-turns and loops. Electron microscopy confirmed that high-order well defined fibrils consisting of several laterally assembled filaments were formed in the mixtures of WT and Cys variants (Fig. 1). These fibrils were morphologically similar to those produced from WT PrP (25Anderson M. Bocharova O.V. Makarava N. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 580-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data confirmed that the incorporation of acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrPs into fibrils did not have noticeable effects on fibrillar secondary structure, the size of the PK-resistant core, or the ability of filaments to assemble into mature high-order fibrils. Determining the Site-specific Conformational Stability—To determine the site-specific conformational stability, the fibrils produced from mixtures of acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrP variants and WT PrP were incubated in solutions containing increasing concentrations of GdnHCl (from 0 to 7 m,in0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.0, for 1 h, at 23 °C) followed by measurement of steady-state acrylodan fluorescence. Our preliminary studied revealed that the incubation of fibrils for 1 h was enough to reach apparent equilibrium. With an increase in GdnHCl concentration, the acrylodan emission spectra displayed a decrease in fluorescence intensity and a red shift in λmax (Fig. 2a). Because acrylodan is highly sensitive to solvent polarity within its immediate environment, its emission maximum shifts from 460 to 470 nm in a non-polar environment such as the protein interior to ∼520 nm in a polar environment such as water. The red shift in λmax was consistent with removal of acrylodan-labeled residues from the fibrillar interior into the solvent environment. Therefore, for probing the conformational status of different PrP regions in GdnHCl-induced denaturation, we used λmax of acrylodan emission as an observable parameter. The site-specific denaturation profiles for fibrils labeled at residues 98, 127, 144, 196, and 230 showed cooperative, apparent two-state transitions, whereas the unfolding profile for fibrils labeled at residue 88 displayed a non-cooperative transition (Fig. 2b). The non-cooperative unfolding at residue 88 correlated well with the high susceptibility of the N-terminal region to PK digestion in recombinant fibrils and in PrPSc (22Bocharova O.V. Breydo L.

To calculate the thermodynamic parameters for the residues that exhibited cooperative unfolding, we used non-linear fitting of the denaturation profiles to the two-state model of protein unfolding (30Baskakov I.V.

The Gibbs free energy ΔG°, the cooperativity of unfolding (the m values), and the C½ values calculated from this fitting are presented in Table 1. Both ΔG° and the C½ values are typically used for evaluating the conformational stability of globular proteins. However, because ΔG° is estimated from the linear extrapolation of ΔG from the transition zone to zero concentration of the denaturant, a functional dependence that could be non-linear (30Baskakov I.V.

Surprisingly, the site-specific stability for residue 98 was substantially lower (C½ = 3.57 m) than those determined for the aforementioned residues (Table 1, Fig. 2b). These data suggest that at least two independent structural domains were formed within amyloid fibrils. Both domains exhibited cooperative unfolding; however, they displayed markedly different conformational stabilities. Indeed, at 4 m GdnHCl, the domain associated with residue 98 was largely unfolded, whereas the domain encompassed by residues 127 and 230 was still folded. The Site-specific Denaturation at Residues 144 and 230 Coincides with the Global Unfolding of Amyloid Structure—Although our studies defined the site-specific denaturation profiles for selected residues, it is not known whether any of the site-specific denaturation curves represented global unfolding of amyloid cross-β-structure. To address this question, we measured the GdnHCl-induced denaturation profiles using a ThT binding assay. Because ThT selectively binds to amyloid structures, this assay offers a rapid and sensitive way for quantitative measurement of the amount of amyloid structure, therefore offering a tool for monitoring the global unfolding of fibrils. As determined from the ThT assay, the C½ values for global unfolding were nearly identical (ranging between 4.77 and 4.95 m), regardless of whether the fibrils were formed solely from WT or from mixtures of WT and acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrP variants (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The denaturation profiles measured by the ThT assay were superimposable for all six mixtures with that of WT (Fig. 3). These experiments demonstrated that (i) incorporation of the acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrP variants into fibrils did not alter the global stability of fibrils and (ii) the conformational stability determined for residues 144 and 230 represents the global stability of amyloid structure as judged from the C½ values. The site-specific stabilities at positions 127 and 196 were slightly lower than those for residues 144 and 230 (C½ = 4.47 and 4.40 m versus 4.97 and 4.98 m, respectively). It is likely that residue 127 is at the edge of the region that constitutes the fibrillar core, whereas residue 196 might be in the vicinity of the fibrillar interface. Taken together, our results indicate that the region ∼127–230 appears to adopt conformationally the most stable cross β-sheet core in the amyloid fibrils. Next we were interested in knowing whether the PrP region that adopts cross β-sheet core was also responsible for the initial interactions during nucleation stage of fibrilization. The N-terminal and C-terminal Regions Are Involved in Nucleation—To identify the sites that were involved in the nucleation, we monitored the kinetics of amyloid formation in parallel using two assays, ThT binding and acrylodan fluorescence. Although the ThT binding assay reports formation of amyloid structures, the acrylodan fluorescence monitors the local environment of the residues labeled with this dye. Therefore, the acrylodan fluorescence assay determines whether specific residues are exposed to the solvent or buried in the protein interior as a function of polymerization time. The lag phases and kinetic profiles of acrylodan fluorescence was very similar for all six mixtures of WT and acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrP variants (Fig. 4 and Table 2). This indicates that the acrylodan probe becomes shielded from the aqueous solvent at similar rates regardless of the site-specific position of the label. As judged from the ThT assay, however, the reaction mixtures containing any one of four acrylodan-labeled Cys-PrP variants (88, 98, 196, and 230) displayed substantially longer lag phase (∼1.5–2-fold) than the mixtures with the variants 127 or 144 or for WT PrP alone (Fig. 4 and Table 2). The kinetics of polymerization in the mixtures of WT and variants 127 or 144 were similar to that observed for WT PrP alone (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Therefore, although the residues at all six positions were secluded at the same rat"

This study demonstrates the novel cellular role of the cysteine protease cathepsin L for producing the (Met)enkephalin peptide neurotransmitter from proenkephalin (PE) in the regulated secretory pathway of neuroendocrine PC12 cells. These findings were achieved by coexpression of PE and cathepsin L cDNAs in PC12 cells with analyses of PE-derived peptide products. Expression of cathepsin L resulted in highly increased cellular levels of (Met)enkephalin, resulting from the conversion of PE to enkephalin-containing intermediates of 23, 18–19, 8–9, and 4.5 kDa that were similar to those present in vivo. Furthermore, expression of cathepsin L with PE resulted in increased amounts of nicotine-induced secretion of (Met)enkephalin. These results indicate increased levels of (Met)enkephalin within secretory vesicles of the regulated secretory pathway. Importantly, cathespin L expression was directed to secretory vesicles, demonstrated by colocalization of cathepsin L-DsRed fusion protein with enkephalin and chromogranin A neuropeptides that are present in secretory vesicles.

Cathepsin L generates (Met)enkephalin in vitro from enkephalin-containing peptide substrates, resulting from cleavage at paired basic residue processing sites, as well as monobasic residue sites. It is notable that these findings for a potential secretory vesicle function of cathepsin L contrast with the well known lysosomal function of cathepsin L for protein degradation. Therefore, the important question of whether cathepsin L expression is directed to secretory vesicles for proteolytic processing of proenkephalin must be answered by direct cellular gene expression experiments. Therefore, this study evaluated (Met)enkephalin production during expression of cathepsin L in the regulated secretory pathway of neuroendocrine PC12 cells.

Results showed that expression of cathepsin L in PC12 cells resulted in the increased production of (Met)enkephalin, accompanied by the production of proenkephalin-derived intermediates that resemble those in vivo. Importantly, expression of cathepsin L resulted in elevated amounts of nicotine-induced secretion of (Met)enkephalin. Colocalization of cathepsin L with enkephalin in regulated secretory vesicles was demonstrated by immunofluorescent microscopy. Although expression of the cathepsin L-DsRed fusion protein was directed to neuropeptide-containing secretory vesicles, expression of the DsRed protein alone resulted in its localization throughout the cell. These novel findings demonstrate that the cysteine protease cathepsin L participates in the biosynthesis of the enkephalin peptide neurotransmitter in the regulated secretory pathway of neuroendocrine PC12 cells. These findings provide evidence for cathepsin L as a cysteine protease pathway for the biosynthesis of enkephalins and possibly other neuropeptides. Construction of Prepro-cathepsin L cDNA in the pcDNA3.1 Vector—The pcDNA3.1 plasmid vector was used for expression of cathepsin L in PC12 cells. The bovine cDNA encoding prepro-cathepsin L was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from total bovine pituitary RNA isolated by the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA was generated by Super-Script II reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen) using conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). PCR with the first strand cDNA as template and Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) utilized primers (0.4 μm) consisting of 5′-AAAAGCTAGCATCCACCATGAATCCTTCATTCTTCCTG ACTGT-3′ (with NheI site, underlined) for the 5′-primer and 5′-AAAAAGGATCCTCAAACAGTTGGATAGCTGGCTGCTGT-3′ (with BamHI site, underlined) for the 3′-primer, under PCR cycle conditions of 94 °C for 60 s, 44 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 80 s, for a total of 30 cycles. The amplified prepro-cathepsin L cDNA fragment (size of about 1.0 kb) was double-digested with NheI/BamHI and ligated to NheI/BamHI digested pcDNA3.1 plasmid expression vector (Invitrogen). This construct was subjected to DNA sequencing (Davis DNA sequencing Inc., Davis, CA) to verify the nucleotide sequence and deduced primary amino acid sequence of the bovine prepro-cathepsin L cDNA. Preproenkephalin cDNA in the pcDNA3.1 Vector—The preproenkephalin cDNA (bovine) was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR as described in the previous paragraph, using poly(A)(+) RNA isolated from bovine adrenal medulla, as described previously (25Hwang S.-R. Kohn A.B. Hook V.Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PCR utilized the primers 5′-AAAAAGCTAGCCACCATGGCGCGGTTCCTGGGACT-3′ (with NheI site, underlined) and 5′-AAAAAAGGATCCCACTGATGGGAAAGGGGATTAAAATCTCAT-3′ (with BamHI site, underlined) to generate the preproenkephalin cDNA, verified by DNA sequencing (by Davis DNA Sequencing Inc., Davis, CA). Prepro-cathepsin L-DsRed Fusion Construct for Expression—A fusion construct of prepro-cathepsin L (bovine) with DsRed fused to the COOH terminus of cathepsin L was prepared in the pDsRed1-N1 vector (BD Biosciences). The prepro-cathepsin L without termination codon was obtained by PCR of the bovine prepro-cathepsin L cDNA with Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with primers consisting of 5′-AAAAGCTAGCATCCACCATGAATCCTTCATTCTTCCTGACTGT-3′ (with NheI site, underlined) and 5′-AAAAAGGATCCAACAGTTGGATAGCTGGCTGCTGT-3′ (with BamHI site, underlined), using PCR cycling conditions (30 cycles total) with each cycle consisting of 94 °C for 60 s, 44 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 80 s. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with BamHI/NheI and ligated to BamHI/NheI digested pDsRed2-N1 vector (BD Biosciences) to generate the prepro-cathepsin L-DsRed construct. DNA sequencing verified that the cathepsin l-DsRed sequence was obtained by PCR and subcloning. Coexpression of PE and Cathepsin L in PC12 Cells—The rat adrenomedullary PC12 neuroendocrine cell line (obtained as a gift from Dr. Daniel O'Connor, University of California, San Diego, CA) was grown at 37 °C with 6% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin. Five micrograms of preproenkephalin cDNA/pcDNA3.1 (PPE 2The abbreviations used are: PE, proenkephalin; PPE, preproenkephalin; CHAPS, 3-((3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonic acid; RIA, radioimmunoassay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. /pcDNA 3.1) was transfected into PC12 cells, plated the previous day at 1.5 × 106 cell/well (70% confluency) in 6-well plates, with the GenePorter-2 transfection reagent using the protocol recommended by manufacturer (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Three days after the PPE/pcDNA3.1 was transfected, the prepro-cathepsin L/pcDNA3.1 construct was then transfected into the proenkephalin-expressing PC12 cells using the GenePorter-2 reagent. Control experiments were performed with PC12 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector alone, PPE/pcDNA3.1 alone, and prepro-cathepsin L/pcDNA3.1 alone. Cells were collected 3 days after transfection with prepro-cathepsin L/pcDNA3.1. Evaluation of PE Processing Products by Western Blotting and Radioimmunoassay (RIA)—Transfected cells were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and pelleted cells were subjected to homogenization in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm E64c, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm chymostatin, 0.1 mm AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride), 10 μm leupeptin, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 3 mm CHAPS. Cells were then disrupted by freeze-thawing (three times). Solubilized proteins were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. High molecular weight proenkephalin (PE)-derived products were analyzed by Western blots with anti-(Met)enkephalin and anti-synenkephalin (recognizing the NH2-terminal domain of PE that lacks enkephalin sequences). Twenty micrograms of protein from transfected cells was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), and Western blots were performed using anti-(Met)enkephalin (from Chemicon Inc., Temecula, CA) or anti-synenkephalin, as we have described previously (25Hwang S.-R. Kohn A.B. Hook V.Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Processed (Met)enkephalin was measured by RIA as we have described previously (14Yasothornsrikul S. Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Toneff T. Bundey R. Miller R. Schilling B. Petermann I. Dehnert J.

This RIA does not cross-react with PE, and therefore, measures processed (Met)enkephalin. Regulated Secretion of (Met)enkephalin Induced by Nicotine—Subsequent to cotransfection of PC12 cells with both PE and cathepsin L cDNAs, as described above, evaluation of regulated secretion of (Met)enkephalin was conducted. Regulated secretion was induced by nicotine (10 μm) by incubation of transfected cells with nicotine for 15 min, as described previously (26Taylor C.V. Taupenot L. Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Wu H. Yasothornsrikul S. Toneff T. Caporale C. Jiang Q. Parmer R.J. Hook V.Y.H. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22905-22915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Culture media were collected, and levels of (Met)enkephalin were measured by RIA. Colocalization of Cathepsin L with Enkephalin in Secretory Vesicles of PC12 Cells by Confocal Immunofluorescent Microscopy—PC12 cells were transfected with the prepro-cathepsin L-DsRed construct as described above for transfection of prepro-cathepsin L/pcDNA3.1, and cathepsin L-DsRed immunofluorescence was examined 3–4 days after transfection. For cellular fixation, cells were harvested and reseeded at 100,000–500,000 cells/well in poly-d -lysine-coated 2-well chamber slides for 4 h in culture media. Culture media were then aspirated, and cells were rinsed in PBS three times. Cells were then fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, rinsed with PBS four times, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. Colocalization of cathepsin L-DsRed with (Met)enkephalin was performed by immunostaining of cells with anti-(Met)-enkephalin (1:100 dilution, Chemicon Inc., Temecula, CA) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, slides were mounted with VectaShield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and analyzed for immunofluorescence of cathepsin l-DsRed (red fluorescence) and enkephalin immunofluorescence (green fluorescence) using a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope coupled to a PCM-2000 confocal system with image analyses by SimplePCI software. Alternatively, cathepsin l-DsRed colocalization was also examined with the secretory vesicle marker chromogranin A (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), visualized with anti-rabbit AgG/Alexa 488 (green fluorescence). In Vivo Colocalization of Cathepsin L with Enkephalin in Adrenal Medulla (Bovine)—Fresh adrenal medullas (bovine) were obtained, and tissue slices were fixed as we have described previously (27Hwang S.-R.

W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, NY2000: 691-696Google Scholar). In addition, PC12 cells lack substantial amounts of prohormone processing enzymes, demonstrated by expression of intact proopiomelanocortin in these cells (29Cool D.R. Fenger M. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8723-8729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For these reasons, PC12 cells were an ideal choice for studies of proenkephalin expression and processing during expression of cathepsin L in the regulated secretory pathway. PC12 cells were transfected with the preproenkephalin (PPE) and preprocathepsin L cDNAs for analyses of (Met)enkephalin production. The production of (Met)enkephalin was quantitated by a specific RIA that specifically detects (Met)enkephalin but not its PE precursor. Cellular (Met)enkephalin was elevated 8-fold in cells expressing cathepsin L and PE when compared with cells expressing PE alone (Fig. 1). Cathepsin L expression in PE-containing cells generated ∼80-fold greater levels of (Met)enkephalin when compared with vector control. Expression of cathepsin L alone produced a small increase in (Met)enkephalin, suggesting that PC12 cells endogenously express low levels of PE. In addition, expression of PE alone resulted in a small increase in (Met)enkephalin levels, suggesting the presence of low amounts of endogenous PE processing enzyme(s); endogenous enzymes may include low levels of prohormone convertases or cathepsin L itself. Notably, (Met)enkephalin production was increased by nearly 10-fold in cells coexpressing cathepsin L and PE when compared with cells expressing only PE or only cathepsin L. These results indicate the participation of cathepsin L in the cellular production of (Met)enkephalin. To assess the cathepsin l-mediated production of cathepsin L with enkephalin in the regulated secretory pathway, nicotine-stimulated secretion of (Met)enkephalin was tested. Amounts of (Met)enkephalin secreted during nicotine stimulation of cells were increased by 5-fold in cells expressing cathepsin L when compared with control cells without expression (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate a functional role for cathepsin L in the regulated secretory pathway for the production of (Met)enkephalin. Cathepsin L Expression in PC12 Cells Generates PE-derived Intermediates That Resemble Those in Vivo in Chromaffin Granules—Cathepsin L processing of PE in PC12 cells was analyzed by epitope-specific antisera to proenkephalin domains in Western blots. Cells transfected with the PPE cDNA showed the presence of PPE and PE as 33- and 31-kDa bands, respectively, detected by Western blots with anti-enkephalin serum (Fig. 3a). These findings are consistent with the production of PPE with a signal peptide that is removed at the rough endoplasmic reticulum to generate the slightly smaller PE, which is routed to secretory vesicles for proteolytic processing (1Hook V.Y.H. Azaryan A.V. Hwang S.-R. Tezapsidis N. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Coexpression of cathepsin L with PE resulted in the production of PE-derived intermediates of 23 and 18–19 kDa detected by anti-(Met)enkephalin Western blots (Fig. 3a). Western blots with anti-synenkephalin serum, which recognizes the NH2-domain of bovine PE (12Hook V.Y.H. Liston D. Neuropeptides. 1987; 9: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), detected PE-derived intermediates of 26, 23, 18–19, and 8–9 kDa (Fig. 3b). Expression of 27-kDa cathepsin L, corresponding to the single chain form of this protease, was confirmed by anti-cathepsin L immunoblotting (Fig. 3c). Importantly, cathepsin L generated PE-derived peptides in transfected PC12 cells that resemble in vivo PE-derived intermediates (Fig. 4). In vivo, the primary PE-derived products in adrenomedullary chromaffin cells consisted of 23-, 18–19-, 8–9-, and 4.5-kDa enkephalin-containing peptides (Fig. 4a). PC12 cells expressing PE and cathepsin L showed the same intermediates of 23, 18–19, 8–9, and 4.5 kDa (Fig. 4b). These results demonstrate that cathepsin L expression in PC12 cells produces PE-derived intermediates that resemble those in vivo in adrenal medulla. These results support a role for cellular cathepsin L processing of PE. Secretory Vesicle Localization of Cathepsin L with Enkephalin in Vitro and in Vivo—Support for the cathepsin L production of enkephalin in secretory vesicles was indicated by their cellular colocalization, examined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. During coexpression of cathepsin L and PPE cDNAs, cathepsin L (red immunofluorescence) and (Met)enkephalin (green immunofluorescence) were colocalized, as demonstrated by the merged images indicating their colocalization (Fig. 5, indicated by yellow immunofluorescence). Cathepsin L and enkephalin showed punctate patterns of immunostaining that are consistent with localization to secretory vesicles. Furthermore, in vivo, adrenal medulla chromaffin cells showed a discrete pattern of cathepsin L immunofluorescence that was colocalized with (Met)enkephalin (Fig. 6). These findings illustrate the secretory vesicle localization of cathepsin L in neuronal PC12 cells in vitro and in vivo in adrenal medullary chromaffin cells.FIGURE 6In vivo cathepsin L colocalization with enkephalin in adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. In vivo colocalization of cathepsin L with enkephalin in adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (bovine) was examined by immunohistochemistry of tissue sections with rabbit anti-cathepsin L and mouse anti-(Met)enkephalin. Cathepsin L was detected with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence), and (Met)enkephalin immunofluorescence was detected with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (red fluorescence). Merging of images demonstrated colocalization of cathepsin L and (Met)enkephalin, illustrated by yellow fluorescence. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (blue).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Trafficking of Cathepsin L-DsRed Fusion Protein to Secretory Vesicles in PC12 Cells—To assess cathepsin L expression and protein trafficking to secretory vesicles, the cathepsin L-DsRed fusion protein construct was utilized to allow direct fluorescence visualization of the subcellular localization of DsRed fused with cathepsin L, when compared with expression of DsRed alone. Expression of cathepsin L-DsRed resulted in its localization with the endogenous secretory vesicle marker chromogranin A (CgA) (Fig. 7a). Notably, nearly all the cathepsin L-DsRed was colocalized with chromogranin A in a punctate pattern of staining. In contrast, expression of DsRed alone resulted in its presence throughout the cell in nuclei and cytoplasm (Fig. 7b). These results demonstrate that cathepsin L possesses the ability to direct the trafficking of the heterologous DsRed protein to secretory vesicles. Furthermore, neuroendocrine types of cells, represented by PC12 cells, apparently possess mechanisms to route cathepsin L to secretory vesicles. Thus, expression of cathepsin L in PC12 cells that contain the regulated secretory pathway results in trafficking of cathepsin L to secretory vesicles for the production, storage, and secretion of the (Met)enkephalin peptide neurotransmitter. Expression of cathepsin L with PE in neuroendocrine PC12 cells resulted in the conversion of PE to enkephalin-containing intermediates to mature (Met)enkephalin (Fig. 8) in the regulated secretory pathway. Cathepsin L generated high molecular mass PE-derived intermediates of 26 to ∼4.5 kDa that were similar to those present in vivo in enkephalin-containing secretory vesicles of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (11Fleminger G. Ezra E. Kilpatrick D.L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6418-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Udenfriend S. Kilpatrick D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cathepsin L processing of PE resulted in elevated levels of cellular (Met)enkephalin with increased amounts of nicotine-induced secretion of (Met)enkephalin via the regulated secretory pathway. Furthermore, cathepsin L was colocalized to enkephalin-containing secretory vesicles. Expression of cathepsin l-DsRed resulted in its trafficking to secretory vesicles that contain the chromogranin A (a marker for secretory vesicles), whereas DsRed expression alone (not fused to cathepsin L) resulted in the localization of DsRed throughout the cell in nuclei and cytoplasm. Clearly, cathepsin L expression in neuroendocrine PC12 cells allows trafficking of cathepsin L to secretory vesicles. In addition, in vivo colocalization of cathepsin L with enkephalin in adrenal medulla was demonstrated. These findings indicate that cellular cathepsin L participates in the processing of proenkephalin to produce the active (Met)enkephalin peptide neurotransmitter in the regulated secretory pathway. These results demonstrate that cathepsin L functions as a novel processing enzyme that converts a neuropeptide precursor into (Met)enkephalin that functions as a peptide neurotransmitter. These findings provide significant evidence for cathepsin L as a cysteine protease pathway for the biosynthesis of enkephalins and possibly other neuropeptides including the proopiomelanocortin-derived peptide hormones. 3V. Hook, unpublished observations. Importantly, cellular cathepsin L participates in the proteolytic processing of PE, as illustrated by expression of cathepsin L with PE in neuroendocrine PC12 cells (derived from rat adrenal medullary pheochromocytoma). Immunoblot analyses with anti-(Met)enkephalin and with anti-synenkephalin that recognizes the NH2-terminal domain of PE (bovine) showed that cathepsin L generated NH2-terminal domain-containing intermediates of 26, 22–23, 18–19, and 8–9 kDa (Fig. 8). Moreover, these PE intermediates are present in vivo in chromaffin secretory vesicles (11Fleminger G. Ezra E. Kilpatrick D.L. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6418-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Udenfriend S. Kilpatrick D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Clearly, cathepsin L converts PE to intermediates and peptide products in neuroendocrine PC12 cells that resemble those in vivo. Secretory vesicle cathepsin L has been shown to cleave proenkephalin- and enkephalin-containing intermediates at the NH2-terminal side of paired basic residues, and occasionally, between the dibasic residues (32Hook V. Yasothornsrikul S. Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Troutner K. Toneff T. Bundey R. Logrinova A. Reinheckel T. Peters C. Bogyo M. Biol.

Such cleavage specificity would result in the production of enkephalin peptide intermediates with basic residue extensions at NH2 and COOH termini. These basic residues at NH2 and COOH termini can be removed by the exopeptidases aminopeptidase B and carboxypeptidase E/H that are present in PC12 cells (28Das B. Sabban E.L. Kilbourne E.J. Fricker L.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2263-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36Balogh A. Cadel S. Foulon T. Picart R. Der Garabedian A. Rousselet A. Tougard C. Cohen P. J.

O'Neill A. Bark S. Foulon T. Hook V. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1340-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, removal of COOH-terminal basic residues of neuropeptides is accomplished by carboxypeptidase E/H (41Hook V. Yasothornsrikul S. Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Troutner K. Toneff T. Bundey R. Logrinova A. Reinheckel T. Peters C. Bogyo M. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 42Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), which is also present in secretory vesicles with enkephalin and neuropeptides. Thus, expression of proenkephalin with cathepsin L in PC12 cells, combined with endogenous aminopeptidase B and CPE/H, yields mature, processed (Met)enkephalin measured by radioimmunoassay in this study. Significantly, expression of cathepsin L promotes the production and secretion of (Met)enkephalin in the regulated secretory pathway, demonstrated by increased nicotine-stimulated secretion of (Met)enkephalin. Colocalization of cellular cathepsin L to enkephalin-containing secretory vesicles in transfected PC12 cells, as well as in adrenal medullary chromaffin cells in vivo, supports the hypothesis that cathepsin L functions within secretory vesicles for the production of (Met)enkephalin. These results demonstrate a biological role of cathepsin L for the production of an active peptide neurotransmitter. The secretory vesicle function of cathepsin L for the production of an active neuropeptide is distinct from its well known lysosomal function for protein degradation. It is notable that nearly all of the expressed cathepsin L in neuroendocrine PC12 cells was localized to neuropeptide-containing secretory vesicles. It was of interest that the cathepsin L-DsRed fusion protein was routed to secretory vesicles, but DsRed alone (without signal peptide) was present throughout the cell in nuclei and cytoplasm. Thus, cathepsin L directs the trafficking of the heterologous DsRed protein to secretory vesicles. It is notable that cathepsin L in PC12 cells is routed almost entirely to secretory vesicles, based on its colocalization with the secretory vesicle markers enkephalin and chromogranin A. These results suggest that PC12 cells route the majority of cathepsin L to secretory vesicles rather than to lysosomes. It is apparent that in neuroendocrine PC12 cells, cathepsin L is routed to secretory vesicles that produce, store, and secrete neuropeptides. These studies of cathepsin L expression in PC12 cells for (Met)enkephalin production complement cathepsin L gene knock-out studies that demonstrate reduction of (Met)enkephalin in brain by ∼50% (14Yasothornsrikul S. Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Toneff T. Bundey R. Miller R. Schilling B. Petermann I. Dehnert J. Logvinova A. Goldsmith P. Neveu J.M. Lane W.S. Gibson B. Reinheckel T. Peters C. Bogyo M. Hook V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9590-9595Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The direct expression experiments of this study demonstrate the active participation of cathepsin L in the proteolytic processing of PE that is required for the biosynthesis of (Met)enkephalin. Thus, the cellular expression studies of cathepsin L, combined with the cathepsin L gene knock-out data, together provide support for a role of cathepsin L in producing (Met)enkephalin. The role of cathepsin proteases in secretory vesicles has been extended in several studies, demonstrating biological roles for cathepsins in these vesicles. For example, cathepsin B has been found to be present in granules of rat islets of Langerhans where proinsulin is converted to insulin (43Docherty K. Carroll R. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3245-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 44Docherty K. Hutton J.C. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6041-6044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the pancreatic secretory pathway, cathepsin B is involved in trypsinogen activation during hereditary pancreatitis (45Kukor Z. Mayerle J. Kruger B. Toth M. Steed P.M. Halangk W. Lerch M.M. Sahin-Toth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21389-21396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In juxtaglomerular secretory granules, cathepsin B participates in processing prorenin (46Neves F.A.R. Duncan K. Baxter J.D. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 514-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Jutras I. Reudelhuber T.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). With respect to neuronal functions, cathepsin B has been identified in neurosecretory vesicles of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells as a candidate β-secretase for converting amyloid precursor protein into β-amyloid peptides that are secreted (48Hook V. Toneff T. Bogyo M. Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Neveu J. Lane W. Hook G. Reisine T. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); extracellular β-amyloid peptides accumulate in aged brains as notable amyloid deposits in Alzheimer disease (49Iversen L.L. Mortishire-Smith R.J. Pollack S.J. Shearman M.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 50Sisodia S.S. J.

Moreover, the cysteine cathepsins B, L, and H are localized in Golgi and regulated secretory pathways of several neuroendocrine tissues (52Steiner D.F. Docherty K. Carroll R. J. Cell Biochem. 1984; 24: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 53Awaguri S. Sato N. Watanabe T. Ishidoh K. Kominami E. Sato K. Uchiyama Y. Eur. J.

These secretory vesicle functions of cysteine cathepsins contrast with the well known functions of cathepsin proteases in lysosomes for protein degradation. Clearly, cathepsins participate in biological functions of neuroendocrine systems. Overall, this study demonstrates that cathepsin L functions as a proneuropeptide processing enzyme for the conversion of proenkephalin to mature (Met)enkephalin, an opioid peptide neurotransmitter and hormone. The cathepsin L processing pathway represents an alternative route for the biosynthesis of active neuropeptides, in addition to the well known proprotein convertase family of processing proteases. Among the neuroendocrine members of the proprotein convertase family, PC2, has been shown to be involved in proneuropeptide processing for the production of (Met)enkephalin (55Johanning K.

Findings from this study lead to the hypothesis for distinct protease pathways for processing proneuropeptide and related prohormones, the cysteine protease cathepsin L and the subtilisin-like proprotein convertases. It will be of interest in future studies to assess the coordinate regulation of these protease pathways for the biosynthesis of active peptide neurotransmitters. Technical assistance by Katie Troutner and Anna Logvinova was appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2048665335,"Rett syndrome (RS) is the leading cause of profound mental retardation of genetic origin in girls. Since RS is mostly caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, transgenic animal models such as the Mecp2-deleted (""Mecp2-null"") mouse have been employed to study neurological symptoms and brain function. However, an interdisciplinary approach drawing from chemistry, biology and neuroscience is needed to elucidate the mechanistic links between the genotype and phenotype of this genetic disorder.We performed, for the first time, a metabolomic study of brain extracts from Mecp2-null mice by using high-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A large number of individual water-soluble metabolites and phospholipids were quantified without prior selection for specific metabolic pathways. Results were interpreted in terms of Mecp2 gene deletion, brain cell function and brain morphology. This approach provided a ""metabolic window"" to brain characteristics in Mecp2-null mice (n = 4), revealing (i) the first metabolic evidence of astrocyte involvement in RS (decreased levels of the astrocyte marker, myo-inositol, vs. wild-type mice; p = 0.034); (ii) reduced choline phospholipid turnover in Mecp2-null vs. wild-type mice, implying a diminished potential of cells to grow, paralleled by globally reduced brain size and perturbed osmoregulation; (iii) alterations of the platelet activating factor (PAF) cycle in Mecp2-null mouse brains, where PAF is a bioactive lipid acting on neuronal growth, glutamate exocytosis and other processes; and (iv) changes in glutamine/glutamate ratios (p = 0.034) in Mecp2-null mouse brains potentially indicating altered neurotransmitter recycling.This study establishes, for the first time, detailed metabolic fingerprints of perturbed brain growth, osmoregulation and neurotransmission in a mouse model of Rett syndrome. Combined with morphological and neurological findings, these results are crucial elements in providing mechanistic links between genotype and phenotype of Rett syndrome. Ultimately, this information can be used to identify novel molecular targets for pharmacological RS treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2093992506,"Despite fast protein degradation in muscles, protein concentrations remain constant during differentiation and maintenance of muscle tissues. Myogenin, a basic helix-loop-helix-type myogenic transcription factor, plays a critical role through transcriptional activation in myogenesis as well as muscle maintenance. TBP-interacting protein 120/cullin-associated neddylation-dissociated (TIP120/CAND) is known to bind to cullin and negatively regulate SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase, although its physiological role has not been elucidated. We have identified a muscle-specific isoform of TIP120, named TIP120B/CAND2. In this study, we found that TIP120B is not only induced in association with myogenic differentiation but also actively accelerates the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Although myogenin is a short lived protein and is degraded by a ubiquitin-proteasome system, TIP120B suppressed its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of myogenin. TIP120B bound to cullin family proteins, especially Cullin 1 (CUL1), and was associated with SCF complex in cells. It was demonstrated that myogenin was also associated with SCF and that CUL1 small interference RNA treatment inhibited ubiquitination of myogenin and stabilized it. TIP120B was found to break down the SCF-myogenin complex. Consequently suppression of SCF-dependent ubiquitination of myogenin by TIP120B, which leads to stabilization of myogenin, can account for the TIP120B-directed accelerated differentiation of C2C12 cells.

Transcription factors play major roles in development and differentiation of multicellular organisms through regulation of target genes in temporally and spatially specific ways. To understand the cell fate-determining pathway, it is essential to clarify how the amount, activity, and localization of relating transcription factors are regulated. Myogenesis is governed critically by a set of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) 3The abbreviations used are: MRF, myogenic regulatory factor; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TIP, TBP-interacting protein; SCF, Skp1-CUL1-F-box protein; CUL, Cullin; MHC, myosin heavy chain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA; PI, proteinase inhibitor; GM, growth medium; DM, differentiation medium; HA, hemagglutinin; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CAND, cullin-associated neddylation-dissociated; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay. that belong to the basic helix-loop-helix family of proteins (1Berkes C.A.

They include structurally similar MyoD, myogenin, Myf5, and MRF4. Genetic and developmental studies have revealed that MyoD and Myf5, referred to as early genes, have complementary roles and are required for genesis of myoblasts (3Rudnicki M.A. Schnegelsberg P.N.

On the other hand, myogenin and MRF4, referred to as intermediate genes, participate in the middle stage of myogenesis (i.e. myotube formation from myoblasts).

Targeting of myogenin and MRF4 genes does not produce the same phenotype although they have some common roles, implying that these two factors have specific roles in myogenesis in addition to a common role (8Patapoutian A.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Terminal differentiation of muscle, during which muscle-specific proteins such as myosin heavy chain (MHC) and troponinT, referred to as late genes, are induced, is attributed to temporally specific expression of these two factors in myoblasts in addition to MyoD and Myf5. It is well known that a large number of transcription factors participating in cell dynamics such as cell cycle regulation, checkpoint, apoptosis, stimulus response, and differentiation are degraded rapidly through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In general, spatially and temporally specific transcription factors in addition to stress-stimulated factors are sensitive to proteolytic degradation. Proteasome-dependent rapid degradation of those transcription factors enables cells to respond to precise and quick gene expression and subsequent cell status alteration. Among MRF family proteins, it is known that MyoD is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system with a half-life of ∼60 min (10Thayer M.J. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Lassar A.B.

Furthermore the 133rd lysine of MyoD is ubiquitinated by SCFMAFbx complex (14Batonnet S. Leibovitch M.P. Tintignac L. Leibovitch S.A. J. Biol.

Taken together, these findings imply that stability of MRFs is involved in myogenesis, although little is known about the mechanism by which the proteolysis of MRFs is regulated in a physiological condition. TBP-interacting protein 120 (TIP120)/cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated (CAND) was originally identified as a TATA-binding protein (TBP)-interacting protein by our group (20Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The TIP120 family includes TIP120A/CAND1 and TIP120B/CAND2. TIP120A facilitates transcription driven by all classes of RNA polymerases (21Makino Y. Yogosawa S. Kayukawa K. Coin F. Egly J.M. Wang Z.

Cullins associate with several proteins and work as E3 ubiquitin ligases (26Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Cullin 1 (CUL1) forms an SCF complex consisting of Skp1, CUL1 (+Rbx1/Roc1), and F-box protein (27Lyapina S.A. Correll C.C. Kipreos E.T. Deshaies R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the complex, a specific lysine in the C terminus of CUL1 is covalently modified with Nedd8/Rub1, which facilitates association of CUL1 with E2 enzyme and subsequently stimulates the ligation activity (29Furukawa M. Zhang Y. McCarville J. Ohta T. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8185-8197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol.

TIP120A binds to un-neddylated CUL1 and inhibits the assembly of CUL1-associating adaptor proteins (24Zheng J. Yang X. Harrell J.M. Ryzhikov S. Shim E.H. Lykke-Andersen K. Wei N. Sun H. Kobayashi R.

X-ray crystallography of the CUL1-TIP120A complex revealed that the neddylated 720th lysine of CUL1 is a critical TIP120A-binding site (31Goldenberg S.J. Cascio T.C. Shumway S.D. Garbutt K.C. Liu J.

This evidence suggests that association of CUL1 with Nedd8 and TIP120A is competitive and that TIP120A negatively regulates the enzyme activity of the SCF complex (32Min K.W. Kwon M.J. Park H.S. Park Y. Yoon S.K. Yoon J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At the present time, however, we do not know what kind of physiological event TIP120A regulates. TIP120B/CAND2, which is another member of the TIP120 family of proteins, has 1235 amino acids and 60% identity with TIP120A (supplemental Fig. 1) (33Aoki T. Okada N. Ishida M. Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Unlike TIP120A, however, TIP120B has been identified only in mammals. Moreover TIP120B gene is expressed restrictedly in skeletal muscles and cardiac muscles, whereas TIP120A is expressed ubiquitously (33Aoki T. Okada N. Ishida M. Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In a previous work, we found that TIP120B is induced in association with differentiation of C2C12 cells (34Aoki T. Okada N. Wakamatsu T. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). High expression levels of TIP120B mRNA were detected in limb buds of day 14 mouse embryos where muscle tissues are actively forming. These findings led to a hypothesis that TIP120B is involved in myogenesis. It has been demonstrated that both termini of TIP120A interact with CUL1 (31Goldenberg S.J. Cascio T.C. Shumway S.D. Garbutt K.C. Liu J. Xiong Y. Zheng N.

We reported previously that both termini of TIP120A are required for transcription stimulation function (22Kayukawa K. Kitajima Y. Tamura T. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover structures of these regions of TIP120 proteins are conserved between paralogues (i.e. TIP120A and TIP120B) as well as among orthologues (i.e. among TIP120As of various organisms) (supplemental Fig. 1). Accumulating findings as described above suggest that TIP120B regulates muscle-specific proteins by affecting their ubiquitination. In this study, we found that TIP120B positively regulates myogenesis of C2C12 cells through suppression of myogenin degradation. Myogenin is ubiquitinated by SCF complex, and binding of TIP120B to CUL1 leads to dissociation of the SCF-myogenin complex and subsequent inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent myogenin degradation. Results of this study suggest that TIP120B accelerates the differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes through suppression of ubiquitination of myogenin. Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse myoblast C2C12 cells were cultured in growth medium (GM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Sigma), 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To induce myogenic differentiation, 80–100% confluent cells in GM were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the medium was replaced with differentiation medium (DM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, 2% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The medium was exchanged every day. Mouse fibroblast C3H10T1/2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with low glucose (Sigma). These cells can differentiate into myotubes by ectopic expression of MyoD in the DM. For transfection, cells were transfected with the indicated combination of expression plasmids (0.5–2.0 μg/35-mm dish) using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Interference—Small interference RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides were prepared with a Silencer siRNA Construction kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences for targeting the mouse TIP120B/CAND2 and CUL1 were 5′-AAGGTGAAGGAGTACCAAGTG and 5′-AATAGACATTGGGTTCGCCGT, respectively. siRNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a negative control was supplied as a reagent in the kit. Two 29-mer oligodeoxynucleotides for TIP120B/CAND2 (sense, 5′-AACACTTGGTACTCCTTCACCCCTGTCTC; and antisense, 5′-AAGGTGAAGGAGTACCAAGTGCCTGTCTC) and for CUL1 (sense, 5′-AAACGGCGAACCCAATGTCTACCTGTCTC; and antisense, 5′-AATAGACATTGGGTTCGCCGTCCTGTCTC) contain corresponding siRNA sequences (underlined) and flanking sequences complementary to the T7 primer. Templates for siRNA were hybridized with the primer sequence and extended with the Klenow enzyme. The extended sense and corresponding antisense siRNA templates were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase, and transcripts were hybridized to generate double-stranded siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA for each gene using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent. Antibodies and Plasmids—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against TIP120B (33Aoki T. Okada N. Ishida M.

TIP120B ΔC and TIP120B ΔN are derivatives of TIP120B FL that contain TIP120B amino acids from 1 to 1009 and 330 to 1235, respectively. N-terminally HA-tagged TIP120B expression plasmid (HA-TIP120B/HA-TIP120B FL) was inserted into pcDNA (Invitrogen). TIP120B portions in HA-TIP120B ΔC and TIP120B ΔN are the same as those in TIP120B ΔC and TIP120B ΔN, respectively. Mouse myogenin cDNA (pEMSV-myogenin) was a gift from Dr. A.

After cells has been treated with cycloheximide (Sigma) at 50 μg/ml for the indicated times and harvested, myogenin in the lysate was detected by immunoblotting. Purification of Bacterially Expressed Proteins and Pulldown Assay—Mouse myogenin cDNA was subcloned into pGEX4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare). All constructs were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene). Expression of GST-myogenin in E. coli was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-myogenin was purified by using glutathione-agarose beads (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant proteins were finally dialyzed against an appropriate buffer before use. For GST pulldown assay, C2C12 cells were lysed with TNE buffer containing 1.0% Triton X-100, and the protein concentration was determined. Whole cell extracts (1.5 mg) were incubated with 170 pmol of GST-myogenin and mixed with glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 4 h.

After boiling for 5 min in the SDS sampling buffer, ubiquitinated myogenin was detected by immunoblotting. Myogenic Differentiation of C2C12 Cells Associated with Expression of TIP120B/CAND2 Gene—We previously demonstrated that TIP120A/CAND1 is expressed ubiquitously in mouse tissues, whereas its paralogue TIP120B/CAND2 is expressed restrictedly in cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle (33Aoki T.

AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) or Bright homologs constitute a large family of transcription factors in higher eukaryotes that regulate cell proliferation, development, and differentiation. We asked whether Giardia has ARID-like genes and whether they influence gene expression during Giardia encystation. Blast searches of the Giardia genome data base identified two genes with putative ARID/Bright domains (gARID1 and 2). Epitope-tagged gARID1 was found to localize to nuclei. Recombinant gARID1 specifically bound to the encystation-induced cyst wall protein (cwp) gene promoters. Mutation analysis revealed that AT-rich initiators were required for binding of gARID1 to the cwp promoters. gARID1 contains several key residues for DNA binding, and its binding sequences are similar to those of the known ARID family proteins. The gARID1 binding sequences were positive cis-acting elements of the cwp1 promoter during both vegetative growth and encystation. We also found that gARID1 transactivated the cwp1 promoter through its binding sequences in vivo. Our results suggest that the ARID family has been conserved during evolution and that gARID1 is an important transactivator in regulation of the Giardia cwp1 gene, which is key to Giardia differentiation into cysts.

Blast searches of the Giardia genome data base identified two genes with putative ARID/Bright domains (gARID1 and 2). Epitope-tagged gARID1 was found to localize to nuclei. Recombinant gARID1 specifically bound to the encystation-induced cyst wall protein (cwp) gene promoters. Mutation analysis revealed that AT-rich initiators were required for binding of gARID1 to the cwp promoters. gARID1 contains several key residues for DNA binding, and its binding sequences are similar to those of the known ARID family proteins. The gARID1 binding sequences were positive cis-acting elements of the cwp1 promoter during both vegetative growth and encystation. We also found that gARID1 transactivated the cwp1 promoter through its binding sequences in vivo. Our results suggest that the ARID family has been conserved during evolution and that gARID1 is an important transactivator in regulation of the Giardia cwp1 gene, which is key to Giardia differentiation into cysts. Giardia lamblia is an important human intestinal parasite that causes outbreaks of waterborne diarrheal disease (1Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol.

The motile flagellated trophozoites attach to and colonize the human small intestine to cause the symptoms of giardiasis. The dormant infective cysts, which are protectively walled and resistant to external hostile conditions, are responsible for transmission of giardiasis. The ability of trophozoites to encyst in the intestine is key to Giardia pathophysiology. However, little is known of the regulation of encystation. Synthesis and secretion of specific proteins and polysaccharide required for the formation of a protective cyst wall is a major process of encystation (3Eichinger D. Curr. Opin.

The giardial transcription mechanism may be unusual because relatively short 5′-flanking regions (<65 bp) are sufficient for the expression of many constitutive and encystation-induced giardial genes (11Knodler L.A.

Relatively little is known about the transcription machinery in G. lamblia. Only four of the twelve general transcription initiation factors have giardial homologs, and they appear to have diverged at a higher rate than those of crown group eukaryotes (22Best A.A. Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Sogin M.L. Olsen G.J. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Giardial TATA-binding protein is highly divergent with respect to archaeal and higher eukaryotic TATA-binding proteins (22Best A.A. Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Sogin M.L. Olsen G.J. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Giardia does not have a true TFIIB homolog but has a homolog to TFIIB-related factor, which is involved in RNA polymerase III transcription in higher eukaryotes (22Best A.A. Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Sogin M.L. Olsen G.J. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, giardial RNA polymerase II transcription is highly resistant to α-amanitin (23Seshadri V. McArthur A.G. Sogin M.L. Adam R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27804-27810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Few transcription factors have been characterized to date (24Sun C.H. Palm D. McArthur A.G. Svard S.G. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Sun C.H. Su L.H. Gillin F.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 146: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Giardia has several Myb proteins, one of which is encystation-induced and is involved in coordinating up-regulation of four key encystation-induced genes, cwp1, cwp2, cwp3, and g6pi-b and gmyb2 itself (24Sun C.H. Palm D. McArthur A.G. Svard S.G. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The GARP family transcription factors may be involved in transcriptional regulation of many different genes, including the encystation-induced cwp1 gene and constitutive ran gene (25Sun C.H. Su L.H. Gillin F.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 146: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) proteins are known to be involved in chromatin remodeling and regulation of development, cellular differentiation, and cell cycle control (16Sun C.H. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19699-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Wilsker D. Patsialou A. Dallas P.B. Moran E. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar). The ARID protein family has been found in yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants, Drosophila, and mammals (26Wilsker D. Patsialou A. Dallas P.B. Moran E. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). They have been shown to have AT-rich sequence-specific DNA binding activity and have been reported to function as transcriptional activators or repressors (26Wilsker D. Patsialou A. Dallas P.B. Moran E. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mouse Bright (B cell regulator of IgH transcription) is a B cell-specific transactivator (28Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Drosophila dead ringer (dri) is expressed in a developmentally regulated set of tissues, and its product may be a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the cis-regulatory context (29Shandala T. Kortschak R.D. Gregory S. Saint R. Development. 1999; 126: 4341-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human or mouse ARID family proteins have been grouped into seven subfamilies based on their sequence homology (Fig. 1) (30Wilsker D. Probst L. Wain H.M. Maltais L. Tucker P.W. Moran E. Genomics. 2005; 86: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The binding sites of the ARID3 subfamily Bright and DRI are (A/G)AT(T/A)AA, and (A/G)ATTAA or TATTGAT, respectively, all of which contain the sequence ATT embedded within a larger AT-rich sequence (27Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W.

The Bright core binding sites also flanked with AT or ATC run containing AT dimers, which are characteristic of matrix attachment region recognition sites (28Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The binding site of the ARID5 subfamily MRF2 is AATA(C/T) (32Whitson R.H. Huang T. Itakura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Some ARID family proteins are not sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins or they do not bind AT-rich sequences (26Wilsker D. Patsialou A. Dallas P.B. Moran E. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For example, the ARID1 subfamily p270 and Osa, which are members of SWI/SNF complexes, have DNA binding activity but no preference for specific DNA sequences (33Dallas P.B. Pacchione S. Wilsker D. Bowrin V. Kobayashi R. Moran E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3137-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Collins R.T. Furukawa T. Tanese N. Treisman J.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The JARID2 subfamily JUMONJI seems to bind both AT-rich and non-AT-rich sequences (36Kim T.G. Kraus J.C. Chen J. Lee Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42247-42255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because most giardial promoters contain AT-rich sequences spanning the transcription start sites, we asked whether Giardia has ARID family proteins and whether they influence gene expression. We searched the Giardia genome data base for genes encoding ARID-like domains. We identified two giardial ARID homologs and determined the function of gARID1 in Giardia. We found that gARID1 bound to specific AT-rich Inr sequences and functioned as a transcriptional activator in G. lamblia. Giardia Culture—Trophozoites of G. lamblia WB (ATCC 30957), clone C6, were cultured in modified TYI-S33 medium (37Keister D.B. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1983; 77: 487-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) and encysted as described previously (10Sun C.H. McCaffery J.M. Reiner D.S. Gillin F.D. J. Biol.

Isolation and Analysis of the Arid Genes—The G. lamblia genome data base (www.mbl.edu/Giardia) (38McArthur A.G. Morrison H.G. Nixon J.E. Passamaneck N.Q. Kim U. Hinkle G. Crocker M.K. Holder M.E. Farr R. Reich C.I. Olsen G.E. Aley S.B. Adam R.D. Gillin F.D. Sogin M.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 271-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was searched with the amino acid sequence of the mouse MRF2 (GenBank™ accession number AF280065) using the BLAST program (39Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59364) Google Scholar). The gARID1 coding region with 255 nt of 5′- and 190 nt of 3′-flanking regions was cloned and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The garid1 gene sequence in the data base was essentially correct. The sequence of the garid2 gene was also confirmed. To isolate the cDNA of the garid1 gene, we performed RT-PCR with garid1-specific primers using total RNA from Giardia. For RT-PCR, 5 μg of DNase-treated total RNA from vegetative and 24-h encysting cells was mixed with oligo(dT)12–18 and Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Synthesized cDNA was used as a template in subsequent PCR with primers A1F (ATGAATTACTCTCAATACACT) and A1R (ATACCCAAAGTCGTTAATATG). Genomic and RT-PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced (ABI; Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR analysis of cwp1 (U09330) and ran (U02589) gene expression was performed using primers cwp1F (ATGATGCTCGCTCTCCTT) and cwp1R (TCAAGGCGGGGTGAGGCA) and ranF (ATGTCTGACCCAATCAGC) and ranR (TCAATCATCGTCGGGAAG), respectively. RNA and DNA Extraction, Northern Blot, and 5′-RACE Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from Giardia at the indicated differentiation stages using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA was fractionated and transferred to charged nylon membranes (Biodyne B membrane; Pall Corp.). Full-length coding region probes of luciferase, cwp1 (U09330), and ran (U02589) genes were prepared by PCR amplification of genomic DNA using primers lucF (ATGGAAGACGCCAAAAAC) and lucR (TTACACGGCGATCTTTCC), cwp1F and cwp1R, and ranF and ranR, respectively. Radiolabeled probes were prepared using the Rediprime II kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were hybridized and washed as described previously (11Knodler L.A. Svard S.G. Silberman J.D. Davids B.J. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were imaged and quantified using a Storm system (Molecular Dynamics). 5′-RACE analysis was performed using the 5′-RACE system (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotides lucRA1 (CAACACTTAAAATCGCAGTAT) and lucRA2 (CCGGAATGATTTGATTGCCAA) were used as first-strand primer and nested primer, respectively. Plasmid Construction—All garid1 fragments were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing with an BigDye Terminator 3.1 DNA sequencing kit and an ABI 3100 DNA Analyser (Applied Biosystems). Plasmid pPW1 has been described previously (40Sun C.H. Su L.H. Gillin F.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The garid1 gene and its 255-bp 5′-flanking region was amplified with oligonucleotides A5XF (GGCGTCTAGATCTGCAGCGAAGCCTTATTGTATG) and A5AUER (GGCGGAATTCCTAGATGTATCGATACGTATCATACCCAAAGTCGTTAATATGAT), digested with XbaI/EcoRI, and cloned into NheI/EcoRI-digested pNT5 (24Sun C.H. Palm D. McArthur A.G. Svard S.G. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pNA1, contained the garid1 gene under the control of its own promoter. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells transfected with the pNA1 plasmid were selected with G418 as described previously (41Sun C.H. Chou C.F. Tai J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were maintained at 150 μg/ml G418. Cells transfected with pPW1, pPW1m3, or pPW1m4 plasmid containing the pac gene were selected and maintained with 54 μg/ml puromycin. For co-transfection assays (See Fig. 9), Giardia cells were first transfected with plasmid PW1, pW1m3, or pPW1m4 and selected in 54 μg/ml puromycin. The stable transfectants were transfected with plasmid pRANneo (41Sun C.H. Chou C.F. Tai J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or pNA1, and then the cells were doubly selected in both 150 μg/ml G418 and 54 μg/ml puromycin. The luciferase activity was determined as described previously (11Knodler L.A. Svard S.G. Silberman J.D. Davids B.J. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured with an Optocomp I luminometer (MGM Instruments). Western blots were probed with anti-AU1 monoclonal antibody (1/5000 in blocking buffer; BAbCO) and detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1/5000; Pierce) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Assay—The pNA1 stable transfectants were cultured in growth medium under G418 selection. Cells were harvested after 0 or 24 h of encystation, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, attached to glass coverslips (2 × 106 cells/coverslip), and then fixed and stained (11Knodler L.A. Svard S.G. Silberman J.D. Davids B.J. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were reacted with anti-AU1 monoclonal antibody (1/300 in blocking buffer; BAbCO), and anti-mouse ALEXA 568 (1/500 in blocking buffer; Molecular Probes) was used as the detector. gARID1 was visualized using a Leica TCS SP2 Spectral Confocal System. Expression and Purification of Recombinant gARID1 Protein—The genomic garid1 gene was amplified using oligonucleotides A1F and A1R. The product was cloned into the expression vector pCRT7/CT-TOPO (Invitrogen) in-frame with the C-terminal His and V5 tags to generate plasmid pA1. To make the gARID1m expression vector, the garid1 gene was amplified using two primer pairs A1F and A1mR (CTTGGTACGAAGAGTGGCCCCAGCATTGGTGAC) and A1mF (GTCACCAATGCTGGGGCCACTCTTCGTACCAAG) (the underlined GCC encode Ala) and A1R. The two PCR products were purified and used as templates for a second PCR. The second PCR reaction also included primers A1F and A1R, and the product was cloned into the expression vector to generate plasmid pA1m. The pA1 or pA1m plasmid was freshly transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (QIAexpressionist; Qiagen). An overnight pre-culture was used to start a 250-ml culture. E. coli cells were grown to an A600 of 0.5 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Promega) for 2 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) containing 10 mm imidazole and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of a 50% slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow (Qiagen). The resin was washed with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing gARID1 were pooled, dialyzed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, and 15% glycerol and stored at -70 °C. Protein purity and concentration were estimated by Coomassie Blue and silver staining compared with bovine serum albumin. gARID1 was purified to apparent homogeneity (>95%). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded oligonucleotides specified in the text were 5′-end-labeled as described previously (16Sun C.H. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19699-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Binding reaction mixtures contained the components described (16Sun C.H. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19699-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Labeled probe (0.02 pmol) was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C with 5 ng of purified gARID1 protein in a 20-μl volume supplemented with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). Competition reactions contained 200-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotides. In an antibody supershift assay, 0.8 μg of an anti-V5-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) was added to the binding reaction mixture. The mixture was separated on a 4% acrylamide gel by electrophoresis. Identification and Expression of garid1 Gene—To identify genes encoding novel ARID proteins from Giardia, we searched the G. lamblia genome data base (www.mbl.edu/Giardia) (38McArthur A.G. Morrison H.G. Nixon J.E. Passamaneck N.Q. Kim U. Hinkle G. Crocker M.K. Holder M.E. Farr R. Reich C.I. Olsen G.E. Aley S.B. Adam R.D. Gillin F.D. Sogin M.L. FEMS Microbiol.

Layne M.D. Hsieh C.M. Maemura K. Gray S. Lee M.E. Jain M.K. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences with similarity to the ARID domain were found in two proteins that we named gARID1 and 2 (GenBank™ accession number DQ88039 and DQ88040, respectively) (Fig. 1). We first focused on understanding the role of gARID1 in Giardia. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences showed that the garid1 gene contained no introns. The deduced gARID1 protein contains 469 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ∼52.5 kDa and a pI of ∼6.4. The minimal structure of the ARID domain includes six α-helices (H1–H6) separated by β-strands or loops, and it may extend to an additional helix at the N terminus or additional helices at both ends (H0 and H7) (26Wilsker D. Patsialou A. Dallas P.B. Moran E. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The H4-loop2-H5 region is similar to a helix-turn-helix structure (26Wilsker D. Patsialou A. Dallas P.B. Moran E. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Structural studies of Drosophila DRI show that loop2 and H5 contact the major groove and a β-sheet or loop between H1 and H2 and sequences downstream of H6 contact the minor groove (Fig. 2) (27Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the loop2 and helix 5 of the ARID domain shows that the ARID domain of gARID1 is highly similar to those of the human ARID3 subfamily (Fig. 1) (30Wilsker D. Probst L. Wain H.M. Maltais L. Tucker P.W. Moran E. Genomics. 2005; 86: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A neighbor-joining (43Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) phylogenetic tree obtained from the alignment of the loop2 and helix 5 also revealed similarity between gARID1 and the human ARID3 subfamily and between gARID2 and the human JARID2 or AIRD4 subfamily (data not shown). We further aligned the ARID domain of gARID1 with that of the human ARID3 subfamily and Drosophila DRI (Fig. 2). The ARID domain of gARID1 has 35% sequence identity and 51% sequence similarity to Drosophila DRI. Some of the key contact residues identified by structural studies of Drosophila DRI are conserved in gARID1 (Fig. 2) (27Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Four residues in mouse Bright are important for DNA binding, Pro-268, Trp-299, Phe-317, and Tyr-330 (Fig. 2) (44Nixon J.C.

https://openalex.org/W1971832263,"It is well documented that unliganded thyroid hormone receptor (TR) functions as a transcriptional repressor of specific cellular target genes by acting in concert with a corepressor complex harboring histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. To fully explore the cofactors that interact with the transcriptionally repressive form of TR, we biochemically isolated a multiprotein complex that assembles on a TR·retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer in HeLa nuclear extracts and identified its polypeptide components by mass spectrometry. A subset of TR·RXR-associated polypeptides included NCoR, SMRT, TBL1, and HDAC3, which represent the core components of a previously described NCoR/SMRT corepressor complex. We also identified several polypeptides that constitute a DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) enzyme complex, a regulator of DNA repair, recombination, and transcription. These polypeptides included the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs, the regulatory subunits Ku70 and Ku86, and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1. Density gradient fractionation and immunoprecipitation analyses provided evidence for the existence of a high molecular weight TR·RXR·corepressor holocomplex containing both NCoR/SMRT and DNA-PK complexes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that unliganded TR·RXR recruits both complexes to the triiodothyronine-responsive region of growth hormone gene in vivo. Interestingly, DNA-PKcs, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, was found to phosphorylate HDAC3 when the purified TR·RXR·corepressor holocomplex was incubated with ATP. This phosphorylation was accompanied by a significant enhancement of the HDAC activity of this complex.

They mediate the physiological actions of thyroid hormone, which regulates the growth, development, and metabolism of a wide variety of tissues in higher organisms (1Yen P.M. Ando S. Feng X. Liu Y. Maruvada P. Xia X.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 246: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). At the target gene promoter, TR α or β interacts with a distinct DNA sequence, termed thyroid hormone response element (TRE), either as a homodimer or a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR) (2Tsai M.J.

Fletterick R.J. Schaufele F. Baxter J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 351-392PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-bound receptor then functions either as a transcriptional activator or a repressor, depending on its hormonal status, the host cell, and the promoter context (3Ribeiro R.C. Apriletti J.W. Wagner R.L. West B.L. Feng W. Huber R. Kushner P.J. Nilsson S. Scanlan T. Fletterick R.J. Schaufele F. Baxter J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 351-392PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lazar M.A. Endocr.

In the absence of thyroid hormone, TR generally functions as a silencer of basal level transcription from the target promoter (5Damm K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M.

Ligand binding to TR releases transcriptional silencing and leads to the activation of target gene expression. Investigations into the molecular basis of this ligand-dependent switch have led to the identification of distinct cellular coregulatory factors, corepressors and coactivators, which mediate the transcriptional response by the receptor (8Privalsky M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 45-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In the unliganded state, the receptor exists in a conformation that allows it to interact with a corepressor, which mediates transcriptional repression (8Privalsky M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Endocr.

Ligand binding triggers a dramatic change in receptor conformation, resulting in the displacement of the corepressor and recruitment of a coactivator, which mediates transcriptional activation. Several laboratories have characterized the corepressors that interact with TR (8Privalsky M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 13Koenig R.J. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Two distinct but structurally related corepressors, nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT), have been identified (11Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 12Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamel Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). The NCoR and SMRT polypeptides harbor multiple independent repression domains, which contribute to the overall repression function of these corepressors (11Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 12Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamel Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). NCoR or SMRT uses its carboxyl-terminal receptor interaction domain to interact directly with the ligand-binding domain of unliganded TR but does not interact with the ligand-occupied receptor. Within the receptor interaction domain of the corepressor, two corepressor-nuclear receptor boxes containing (I/L)XX(I/V)I signature motifs mediate interaction with the ligand-binding domain (14Hu X. Li Y. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the loss of interaction with NCoR or SMRT impairs transcriptional silencing by TR, indicating that these factors are bona fide corepressors (15Ishizuka T. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5122-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of cellular NCoR and SMRT revealed that these proteins exist in large multiprotein complexes (16Yoon H.G. Chan D.W. Huang Z.Q. Li J.W. Fondell J.D. Qin J. Wong J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1336-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 17Zhang J.S. Kalkum M. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6091-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The core complexes of NCoR and SMRT are essentially the same and composed of NCoR/SMRT, histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), a WD40-repeat protein TBL1, and the G protein suppressor 2. Interestingly, there are also reports that NCoR or SMRT associates with a complex containing Sin3, HDAC1, and HDAC2 (19Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 20Nagy L. Kao H.Y.

Despite significant progress in the isolation and functional characterization of NCoR/SMRT complexes, the identities of the coregulatory proteins that interact with unliganded TR·RXR have not been fully investigated. It is unclear whether TR·RXR needs to interact with regulatory factors in addition to the NCoR/SMRT corepressor to function as a transcriptional repressor. In this report, we describe the biochemical isolation of an unliganded TR·RXR·corepressor holocomplex containing two distinct protein complexes. Although one of these complexes represents the previously described NCoR/SMRT core complex, the other one is a DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) enzyme complex, containing the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK, its regulatory subunits Ku70 and Ku86, and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that DNA-PK is indeed recruited by the repressive form of TR·RXR heterodimer at a natural target promoter in vivo. Most importantly, our studies revealed that DNA-PK targets the HDAC3 component of the NCoR/SMRT corepressor complex for phosphorylation, and this modification enhances the histone deacetylase activity of the complex. We propose that the DNA-PK complex contributes to TR-mediated transcriptional repression by increasing histone deacetylation and thereby influencing chromatin structure and function. Reagents—Glutathione-Sepharose-4B and reduced glutathione were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies against DNA-PKcs, TBL-1, TRα, TRβ1, TRβ2, RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ, and GST were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against HDAC1 and HDAC3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, CA). Rabbit anti-NCoR antibody was raised against carboxyl-terminal amino acids 2057–2453 of murine NCoR fused to GST. Wortmannin, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II, and trichostatin-A were obtained from Sigma. NU7026 was obtained from Calbiochem. Acetyl-[3H]CoA (200.00 mCi/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Isolation of TR·RXR-interacting Polypeptides from HeLa Nuclear Extracts Using Receptor Affinity Chromatography—Nuclear extracts (NE) of HeLa cells were prepared as described previously (21Tong G.X. Jeyakumar M. Tanen M.R. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial expression constructs encoding GST-hTRβ and His6-tagged hRXRα (full-length) have been described previously (21Tong G.X. Jeyakumar M. Tanen M.R. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-TR (0.5 μg) was incubated with glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose beads (50 μl, 1:1 slurry) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with a wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, and 0.02% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma). The immobilized TR was incubated with purified His6-hRXRα (2 μg) for 1 h at room temperature followed by repeated washing with the wash buffer. The bead-bound TR·RXR heterodimer was then incubated with HeLa cell NE (2.5 mg, 2.5 μg/μl) for 2 h at 4 °C on an end-to-end shaker. The beads were subsequently washed four times with the wash buffer. For identification of polypeptides by mass spectrometry, the bound proteins were dissociated under denaturing condition with 0.2% sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate. For analyses of the TR·RXR holocomplex by glycerol density gradient fractionation or immunoprecipitation, the bead-bound complex is eluted under native conditions using 20 mm GSH. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Gel-resolved proteins were digested with trypsin and batch-purified on a reversed-phase micro-tip, and resulting peptide pools were individually analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry for peptide mass fingerprinting, as described (22Erdjument-Bromage H.

Erdjument-Bromage H. Svejstrup J.Q. Tempst P. Methods. 2002; 26: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Selected peptide ions (m/z) were taken to search a “non-redundant” protein data base (NCBI, Bethesda, MD) utilizing the Peptide Search algorithm (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Glycerol Density Gradient Centrifugation—Protein complexes bound to TR·RXR heterodimer were eluted using reduced GSH and fractionated on a 15–60% glycerol gradient based on a previously published procedure (24Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P.B. Burakov D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—A rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognized both NCoR and SMRT (10 μg) was covalently coupled to protein-A-Sepharose, using the chemical cross-linking agent dimethyl pimelimidate, as described previously (25Li J.W. Wang J. Wang J.X. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The immobilized antibody was incubated with purified TR·RXR holocomplex for 3 h at 4 °C. Following repeated washings with wash buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against NCoR/SMRT and DNA-PK. Phosphorylation of TR·RXR Holocomplex and HDAC3—The TR·RXR heterodimer-bound protein complexes were isolated from HeLa nuclear extract as detailed above, except that phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (I and II) were used during receptor immobilization and incubation with nuclear extract. After the final wash, the beads were suspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.02% IGEPAL, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The purified complex was then phosphorylated using a mixture of γ32P-labeled ATP (3.6 fmol of 3000 Ci/mmol) and unlabeled ATP (50 μm) in the presence or absence of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (1 μm) as previously described (26Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. Deleon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated proteins, 32P-labeled TR·RXR holocomplex was suspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and incubated with protein-A-Sepharose beads bound to an antibody against GST or NCoR or DNA-PKcs or HDAC3 or control IgG (10 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C. Following extensive washing with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For the expression of FLAG epitope-tagged human HDAC3, cDNA encoding the full-length HDAC3 was cloned into the NdeI and BamH1 sites of pET-15b vector (Novagen) downstream of a 3×FLAG sequence (inserted at the NCo1 site). The 3×FLAG-HDAC3 fusion protein was expressed in bacteria as described previously (21Tong G.X. Jeyakumar M. Tanen M.R. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-HDAC3 or GST (0.5 μg) immobilized on either M2 beads or GSH beads was subjected to a phosphorylation reaction using 5.0 units of DNA-PK enzyme (Promega, Madison, WI). The proteins were denatured in SDS-sample buffer, resolved on an SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and visualized by autoradiography. Histone Deacetylase Assay—Histone deacetylase assay was carried out using a HDAC assay kit as per manufacturer's instruction (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, an H4 synthetic peptide (residues 2–24) was acetylated in the presence of [3H]acetyl-CoA and p300/CBP-associated factor, a histone acetyltransferase. HDAC activity was assayed by incubating streptavidin-bound radiolabeled H4 peptide with bead-bound purified TR/RXR holocomplexes. Wortmannin (1 μm) and trichostatin A (1 μm) were used where indicated. ChIP Assay—The ChIP assays were carried out as described previously (27Liu X.F. Bagchi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15050-15058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum containing penicillin and streptomycin. 48 h prior to transfection, medium was replaced with DMEM containing 5% T3-stripped serum (28Samuels H.H. Stanley F. Casanova J. Endocrinology. 1979; 105: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with an expression plasmid pCI-hTRβ (0.025 or 0.05 μg), a reporter plasmid pGL DR+4-luciferase (0.5 μg), and an internal control plasmid Renilla luciferase (0.01 μg) using the Lipofectamine-2000 reagent (Life Technology). Wortmannin (0.5 μm) or NU7026 was added where indicated. The TRE-driven firefly luciferase and the internal control Renilla luciferase activities were measured by the instruction provided with the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Unliganded TR·RXR Heterodimer Interacts with the Components of NCoR/SMRT and DNA-PK Complexes—To identify the polypeptides that interact with TR·RXR heterodimer, we employed protein affinity chromatography, using the preformed heterodimers as bait. Human TRβ and RXRα were expressed in Escherichia coli as recombinant proteins fused to GST and polyhistidine tags, respectively. Recombinant GST-TR was first immobilized on GSH beads and then incubated with purified His-RXR to form the TR·RXR heterodimers. As shown in Fig. 1, the immobilized TR·RXR heterodimers contained stoichiometrically equivalent amounts of each receptor partner (lane 4). In addition, multiple proteolytic degradation products of each receptor were also retained on the beads. The GSH beads bound to either GST alone (control) or hormone-free TR·RXR (test) were then incubated with or without HeLa nuclear extracts. The beads were washed extensively, and the bound proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 0.2% N-lauroyl sarcosine. The fractions eluted from the control and test beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the polypeptide components were visualized by silver staining. We noted that the control GST beads non-specifically retained a number of proteins (NS1–5) from HeLa nuclear extracts (lane 2). The same polypeptides were also retained by the TR·RXR beads (lane 4). Strikingly, about fifteen additional polypeptides with relative molecular masses ranging from 50 to 400 kDa were detected in the fraction eluted from the GST-TR·RXR column but were absent in the fraction eluted from the control beads (lane 4). These polypeptides, therefore, interacted specifically with unliganded TR·RXR heterodimers and represented potential constituents of one or more corepressor complex. To determine the identities of the TR·RXR-associated polypeptides, we performed large scale purification using TR·RXR affinity beads, excised bands containing individual polypeptides from SDS-PAGE, and subjected these bands to in-gel tryptic digestion followed by mass spectrometry analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Peptide sequences were obtained from several of these polypeptides, and their identities were established (Table 1). Consistent with previously published reports, several signature components of the NCoR/SMRT complex such as nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR), nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (SMRT), transducin β-like 1 (TBL1), G-protein pathway suppressor 2, and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) were found to be associated with TR·RXR. Interestingly, we also identified four known components of the DNA-PK complex, namely, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), PARP1, ATP-dependent DNA helicase II (Ku86), and thyroid autoantigen (Ku70), as proteins that were retained specifically by TR·RXR. The mass spectrometric analysis also identified specific association of three other proteins, SMC1, DNA-ligase III, and HSP70, with the TR·RXR heterodimer (Table 1). Additionally, we obtained seven mass spectrometric identifications that represented minor polypeptides in the SDS-PAGE. These polypeptides are nucleolin (NCBI JH0148), KIAA1380 protein (BAA92618), RAD50 (XP_034865), zinc finger CW type with coiled-coil domain 2 (NP_078933), thyroid receptor interacting protein 8 (Q15652), eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1α (XP_088468), and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1γ (NP_001395).TABLE 1Identification of TR·RXR-associated polypeptides by mass spectrometryBandProtein identityNCBI no.Peptide sequencep400DNA-PKcsNP_008835WPVAGQIR, LSFAVPFRp270NcoRNP_006302EREREREK, HTSVVSSGPSVLRp270SMRTNP_006303SHIPLAFDPTSIPR, YPPHSLSYPVQIARp143SMC1AAI12128VVQLHEYSEELEK, SGVISGGASDLKp113PARP1AAH37545RLLWHGSR, AEPVEVVAPRp113DNA ligase IIICAA59230NLQDVVER, SLKPVLPHKp86Ku 86NP_0066964VITMFVQR, LTIGSNLSIRp70Ku70AAW34364ILELDQFK, KPGGFDISLFYRp70HSP70NP_005336LLQDFFNGR, LVNHFVEEFKRp62TBL1CAA73319KGNYILSAGVDK, GAMQSVLHHFQRp56TBLR1AAK00301DGNLASTLGQHK, MSISSDEVNFLVYRp55HDAC3NP_003874TFQGHTNEVNAIK, DGNLASTLGQHKp55GPS2CAG46550DGNLASTLGQHK, TFQGHTNEVNAIK Open table in a new tab The TR·RXR-associated polypeptides, therefore, included the components of at least two distinct complexes, the NCoR/SMRT corepressor complex, and the DNA-PK enzyme complex. It is notable that the approach used here did not result in the isolation of any known coactivator, thereby indicating the highly specific nature of our affinity chromatography. The identification of known corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT also gave us confidence that the polypeptides retained by the TR·RXR beads may represent molecules with relevant functions in the receptor-mediated repression pathway. Binding of T3 to TR Inhibits the Interaction of Both NCoR/SMRT and DNA-PK Complexes with TR·RXR Heterodimer—Binding of T3 to TR is reported to trigger the dissociation of NCoR/SMRT from the receptor (11Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 12Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamel Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether the retention of the components of NCoR/SMRT and DNA-PK complexes is influenced by the hormonal status of TR. Immobilized TR·RXR was incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts in the presence and absence of T3. The receptor-bound proteins were then eluted as described above in Fig. 1 and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against NCoR/SMRT and DNA-PKcs. As shown in Fig. 2A, addition of T3 markedly reduced the association of both NCoR/SMRT and DNA-PKcs with TR·RXR. Binding of T3 to TR·RXR, however, had a significantly greater impact on the retention of NCoR/SMRT than that of DNA-PKcs. Whereas treatment with T3 resulted in >90% reduction in the binding of NCoR/SMRT to TR·RXR, the binding of DNA-PKcs was reduced to ∼40%. In a parallel experiment, we investigated whether T3 is able to dissociate NCoR/SMRT and DNA-PK complexes bound to TR·RXR. In this experiment, immobilized TR·RXR heterodimers were incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts to assemble the receptor-protein complexes in the absence of T3. After thorough washings, the TR·RXR-bound polypeptides were incubated with buffer in the presence or absence of 1 μm thyroid hormone. The supernatant containing the eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against various components of the NCoR/SMRT and DNA-PK complexes. None of the polypeptide components of either complex was detected in the eluted fraction in the absence of T3 (data not shown). As expected, treatment with T3 resulted in the dissociation of NCoR, HDAC3, and TBL-1, the known components of the NCoR/SMRT core complex (right lane, Fig. 2B). In agreement with results from Fig. 2A, we found that the components of the DNA-PK complex, namely, DNA-PKcs, PARP1, and Ku70, were also released from the TR·RXR heterodimer upon T3 treatment (right lane, Fig. 2B). However, the hormone-dependent release of DNA-PK components from TR·RXR was relatively less efficient than that of the components of NCoR/SMRT complex. When we examined the HDAC activity of the T3-eluted fraction, we found that as much as 60% of the TR·RXR-bound HDAC activity was recovered in this fraction, and the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin-A (TSA) blocked this activity (Fig. 2C). The simultaneous hormone-induced release of both NCoR and DNA-PK complexes from TR·RXR hinted at a joint involvement of these complexes in the maintenance of the transcriptionally silent state of the receptor and raised the possibility that these two complexes might be physically and functionally linked to each other. Evidence for the Existence of a TR·RXR Holocomplex Containing the NCoR/SMRT Core Complex and the DNA-PK Enzyme Complex—It is conceivable that TR·RXR interacts with the NCoR/SMRT and DNA-PK complexes independently of each other and forms distinct complexes. Alternatively, the constituents of the NCoR/SMRT and the DNA-PK complexes may coexist in a single holocomplex bound to TR/RXR. To distinguish between these possibilities, we eluted TR·RXR and its associated polypeptides from the affinity column under native conditions (GSH elution). We then subjected the eluted polypeptides to glycerol density gradient fractionation and performed an initial analysis of each fraction by Western blotting using antibodies against TR and RXR. The TR and RXR polypeptides resolved into two distinct regions in the gradient, representing complexes of distinct molecular sizes. A lighter complex I, comigrating with free TR·RXR heterodimer, was detected in fractions 3–7 (Fig. 3A, top panel). A heavier complex II, containing TR and RXR, was present in fractions 9–11 (middle panels). When the blot was probed with an antibody against NCoR/SMRT, we found that the fractions 9–11 also contained the corepressor. The complex II, therefore, potentially represented a TR·RXR·corepressor complex (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). To analyze the molecular composition of complex II, we pooled the fractions 9–11 and performed Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for individual components of both NCoR and DNA-PK complexes. We confirmed that the signature components of the cor"

To identify novel substrates of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), the PKA catalytic subunit was engineered to accept bulky N6-substituted ATP analogs, using a chemical genetics approach initially pioneered with v-Src (1Rider M.H.

This mutant protein was active and fully phosphorylated on Thr197 and Ser338. Based on its kinetic properties, the engineered C-subunit preferred N6(benzyl)-ATP and N6(phenethyl)-ATP over other ATP analogs, but still retained a 30 μm Km for ATP. This mutant recombinant C-subunit was used to identify three novel PKA substrates.

Thus, it has many substrates, which usually are highly tissue specific. One such example is the bifunctional enzyme phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK2), which upon phosphorylation by PKA is converted to its phosphatase active mode in liver, but is stabilized in its kinase mode in heart, and is not a PKA substrate in skeletal muscle (1Rider M.H. Bertrand L. Vertommen D. Michels P.A. Rousseau G.G. Hue L. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 561-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Although PKA has been widely studied in most cells, the direct substrates of PKA are difficult to distinguish from downstream substrates that are phosphorylated as a result of the PKA activation. A possible way to determine whether identified substrates are modified by the kinase directly or indirectly via an intermediary kinase is to engineer the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase in question to accept a bulky ATP analog that cannot be used by the wild type kinase. This strategy was developed initially for a tyrosine kinase, v-Src, (2Shah K. Liu Y. Deirmengian C. Shokat K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3565-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and has subsequently been used for other protein kinases (3Dephoure N. Howson R.W. Blethrow J.D. Shokat K.M. O'Shea E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17940-17945Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Shah et al. (4Liu Y. Shah K. Yang F. Witucki L. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 91-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) found that a single mutation conferred specificity for ATP analogs that have a large substituent on the nitrogen at position 6 (N6) on the purine ring of ATP. Two residues that were found within 5 Aå of the N6 position of ATP were based initially on the structures of PKA and CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) since the crystal structure of v-Src was not available at the time (2Shah K. Liu Y. Deirmengian C. Shokat K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3565-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In v-Src, these residues are Val323 and Ile338, while the corresponding residues in PKA are Val104 and Met120. Although the Val323 mutation was found to be not important for conferring specificity in v-Src, mutation of Ile338 to Ala did alter the specificity of v-Src and allowed the enzyme to use an orthogonal bulky ATP analog. Once the crystal structure of hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck), a Src family tyrosine kinase was available, molecular modeling was employed to explore more fully the binding pocket of Hck to find the best analog for the single mutation (5Liu Y. Shah K. Yang F. Witucki L. Shokat K.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). They found that this single mutation opened up a new pocket that was otherwise inaccessible and thus termed this residue the “gatekeeper.” The best analog, based on the modeling, was found to be N6(phenethyl)-ATP and experimentally, N6(phenethyl)-ATP was also preferred by the mutant but was a poor substrate for wild type v-Src. Substitution of the gatekeeper residue has now been applied to find direct substrates of over 30 kinases to date including v-Src (6Shah K. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 35-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and most recently Yersinia PKA (YpkA) (7Juris S.J. Shah K. Shokat K. Dixon J.E. Vacratsis P.O. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In general, this approach can be used for cell extracts but not for intact cells because of the inability of cells to take up the labeled ATP analogs. Ubersax et al. (8Ubersax J.A. Woodbury E.L. Quang P.N. Paraz M. Blethrow J.D. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Morgan D.O. Nature. 2003; 425: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) employed this method to identify the direct substrates of CDK1 on a proteome-wide scale in budding yeast using extracts. Approximately 200 CDK1 substrates were identified, revealing that CDK1 is involved in global regulatory functions in addition to its accepted role in phosphorylating cell-cycle regulatory proteins, thus giving insight into the complexity of the network controlled by this kinase. We have engineered a mutant form of the C-subunit to identify direct PKA (PKA-Cα) substrates in mitochondria. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of complex I in response to cAMP has been reported (9Lee I. Salomon A.R. Ficarro S. Mathes I. Lottspeich F. Grossman L.I. Huttemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6094-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and as at least one AKAP, DAKAP1/AKAP120, is known to recruit both Src and PKA to mitochondria, it is important to unravel the specific PKA signaling pathways that contribute to mitochondrial structure and function. We thus engineered a mutant form of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKA-Cα-analog sensitive-1, PKA-Cα-as1) that accepts an orthogonal ATP analog. Co-expression of the mutant protein with PDK1 in Escherichia coli yields active enzyme that was readily purified. Based on its kinetic properties, we demonstrate a clear preference for N6(benzyl)-ATP for PKA-as1, but not for wild type C-subunit. Using 32P-labeled N6(benzyl)-ATP and the purified engineered catalytic-subunit, we identified three novel PKA substrates in mouse mitochondria including ChChd3 and protein disulfide isomerase A5. ChChd3 is endogenously expressed in mitochondria and may play a role in metal binding similar to Cox17 and Cox19 (10Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Computer Modeling—InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Inc; San Diego, CA) was used to examine and model the ATP-binding site of PKA. The adenosine complex (IBKX, Protein Data Bank code) was modified to simulate mutations in the ATP-binding pocket of ATP. Engineering of C-subunit Mutants—The oligonucleotide used for the mutation of Met120 to Gly is: 5′-TACATGGTCgggGAGTATGTAGCTG-3′ (Genbase). The oligonucleotide used for the mutation of Met120 to Ala is: 5′-TACATGGTCgcgGAGTATGTAGCTG-3′. Lowercase letters represent the mutated amino acid. Mutations in the mouse C-subunit in the pRSETb vector were made using the Kunkel template method (11Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged C-subunit in pET15b was made by cloning out of pRSETb (Invitrogen) at the NdeI and HindIII sites. Mutations introduced in the His-tagged C-subunit pET15b construct were done using Quikchange by Stratagene. Constructs were then transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria. For co-expression of the M120G mutant and PDK1, we used the pET15b vector for the C-subunit and pGEX vector for PDK1. Expression of the M120G Mutant—Colonies tested for expression of C-subunit were grown to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and then run on SDS-PAGE (10%). To test for solubility, the harvested cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaHPO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) and subjected to 3 freeze/thaw cycles. The samples were then centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C (16,000 rpm) in a microcentrifuge to separate the soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (pellet) fractions. The proteins were then separated on an SDS-PAGE (10%) gel. Preparation of [γ-32P]N6(Benzyl)-ATP ([γ-32P]A*TP)—N6 (Benzyl)-ATP was synthesized as previously described (6Shah K. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 35-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Purification of the M120G PKA Catalytic Subunit—After induction, cultures from E. coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria were harvested, spun down, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaHPO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and lysed by one pass in a French pressure cell at 1,000 p.s.i. The resulting lysate was then centrifuged for 40 min at 15,000 rpm in a Beckman JA20 rotor at 4 °C. The His6-tagged C-subunit was then purified using the procedure for Talon Nickel resin (Clontech). The supernatant was batch-bound to 1.0 ml of resin/liter culture for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed twice with lysis buffer and once with wash buffer (same as lysis buffer but at pH 7.0). The His-tagged protein was then eluted with 4 imidazole elutions ranging from 50 to 500 mm. Western Blot Analysis—Lysates from transformed E. coli were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membrane at 30 V for 60 min. The blots were probed with an anti-phosphothreonine 197 antibody (kindly provided by A. Newton, UCSD) and anti-phosphoserine 338 antibody (SynPep Corp.), a custom antibody described previously (12Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was an anti-rabbit horse-radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline Tween-20) overnight. The blocking solution was removed, and the membranes were rinsed twice with TBST. The primary antibody was incubated with the blot at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking. After the primary antibody was removed, the membranes were rinsed four times with TBST. The second antibody, anti-rabbit-HRP, was added at a dilution of 1:2,000, and the blots were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The blots were rinsed with TBST twice and then incubated with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate detection kit (Pierce) for 1 min. Bands were detected with ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Inhibition Assays—The assay mixture consisted of MOPS, MgCl2, 100 μm cold ATP or ATP analog, [γ-32P]ATP (1 pm), 200 μm Kemptide, and 100 nm WT or mutant enzyme in a 30-μl volume. The samples were incubated at 37 °C and quenched with 20 μl of 50% acetic acid. Fifty microliters of the mixture were spotted on phosphocellulose disks. The disks were washed for 10 min in 0.5% phosphoric acid four times, followed by one brief rinse with acetone. They were counted in a scintillation counter. Assays were done in duplicate. Kinetic Assays—Two assays were used to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzymes. Radioactive assays were performed in triplicate using [γ-32P]ATP. The assay mixture was comprised of 50 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm Kemptide, cold ATP or cold N6(benzyl)-ATP or N6(phenethyl)-ATP analogs, and purified recombinant WT and mutant enzyme (0.25–0.5 nm). The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Thirty microliters of each sample were spotted on phosphocellulose disks, washed, and radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter as described above. The computer program Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used to calculate Km and kcat values. Activity Assay—Activity was also monitored using a coupled assay as described by Cook et al. (13Cook P.F. Neville M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski J.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In this assay, 200 μm Kemptide, 100 mm MOPS, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PEP (phosphoenol-pyruvate-dependent enzyme), 1 mm ATP, 15 units/ml LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), 7 units/ml PK (pyruvate kinase), and 0.2 mm NADH, were incubated with 0.3 mg/ml C-subunit. All components except Kemptide and PKA were mixed. The reaction was initiated by adding 990 μl of assay mix to 10 μlofPKA C-subunit. The mixture was blanked in a spectrophotometer, and 10 μl of Kemptide were added to start the reaction. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis/MALDI-TOF—Proteins were diluted in two-dimensional electrophoresis buffer (20 mm dithiothreitol, 8 m urea) containing 0.5% ampholytes (pI range: 3–10), and passively absorbed onto immobilized pH gradient strips (pI range: 3–10) for 16 h at 20 °C, followed by isoelectric focusing on the IPG runner (Invitrogen) for 1,200 V-h and standard SDS-PAGE. The samples were stained with colloidal Coomassie or silver and imaged on a VersaDoc 4000 using the PDQuest software (Bio-Rad). Excised proteins were washed three times in 50% acetonitrile, 10 mm NH4HCO3 followed by a brief dehydration in 100% acetonitrile. Proteins were incubated overnight in 50% acetonitrile, 10 mm NH4HCO3 with 0.05 μg of trypsin (Roche Applied Science). Isolated peptides were washed and concentrated in C18 ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were directly eluted onto a 100 spot platform using a buffer containing 4-α-hydroxycinnamic acid (Agilent), 50% acetonitrile, 10 mm diammonium citrate, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI-TOF analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems Q-Star XL hybrid mass spectrometer. MALDI-TOF fingerprint data were analyzed using Protein Prospector, University of California, San Francisco. Cloning and Purification of ChChd3—The DNA clone for ChChd3 (BC014839) in pCMV-Sport6 vector was ordered from Invitrogen (catalog number 2901125) and subsequently subcloned into a pGEX vector for bacterial expression. The GST tag on the protein was retained for solubility and purification purposes. For the mammalian expression vector, ChChd3 was subcloned into a modified pCMV SP1 with a C-terminal FLAG tag by using EcoR1 and SalI sites. Polyclonal antisera to full-length ChChd3 were generated in rabbits against the peptide sequence QAKKESEHQRRLKQARDLERER (Invitrogen). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to phospho-ChChd3 Thr10 were generated in rabbits against an N-terminal peptide RRVT(PO3)FEADENENC (Pacific Immunology Corp, Ramona, CA). Mitochondria Preparation—Live mice were sacrificed, and the brain was immediately removed and homogenized in buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA; 5 ml per gram of brain tissue). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was removed. This was repeated twice to remove remaining tissue. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min to remove nuclei. Crude mitochondria were collected from the pellet after centrifugation at 11,500 rpm for 10 min. The mitochondria fraction was resuspended in homogenization buffer and centrifuged again at 11,500 rpm for 10 min to remove contaminants. Cell Culture and Confocal Microscopy—10T1/2, HEK 293, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For immunostaining, the cells were grown on the microwell dishes, fixed, and stained with anti-ChChd3 antibodies. The cells were imaged either on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) or a laser scanning confocal microscope (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad) as previously described (14Sastri M. Barraclough D.M. Carmichael P.T. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the Catalytic Subunit—Computer modeling of the PKA catalytic subunit and the v-Src studies suggested that mutating only Met120 was sufficient to allow the kinase to accept an orthogonal ATP analog (Fig. 1). The Kunkel template method (11Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar) was then used to introduce mutations into the catalytic subunit sequence in the pRSETb vector. Constructs were engineered to convert Met120 to both Gly and Ala. In addition to these single mutants a double mutant was engineered where Val104 was replaced with Ala. Expression was carried out as described previously (15Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20940-20946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression—When the M120G mutant was expressed initially in E. coli, the protein was highly insoluble. Efforts to purify the protein via the established protocol for wild type C-subunit using P-11 resin and MonoS chromatography also failed. Consequently, the mutated PKA was cloned into a vector for His6 expression (pET156b). This allowed us to purify the protein using a nickel resin. Expression improved under these conditions; however, the protein remained mostly insoluble. It is not uncommon for mutant PKA C-subunits to be insoluble because of defective phosphorylation of the protein. Typically when the wild type C-subunit is expressed in E. coli it is fully active and contains 2–4 phosphates due to autophosphorylation (16Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Grant B. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Using an antibody generated against the activation loop of PKC that works well for PKA (17Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the His-tagged M120G mutant was not phosphorylated on either Thr197 in the activation loop or on Ser338 in the C-terminal tail (supplemental Fig S1, A and C) under typical expression conditions. To generate soluble and active enzyme, His6-tagged M120G was co-expressed with PDK1, which efficiently phosphorylates Thr197 and resulted in soluble protein (supplemental Fig S1, B and C). Western blots (supplemental Fig S1C) confirmed that both Thr197 and Ser338 were phosphorylated only when the mutant C-subunit was co-expressed with PDK1. Under these conditions, there is still some insoluble protein, but a clear change in the phosphorylation state of the protein and in the yield of the pure protein was seen. Clearly, the mutation disrupts the ability of the protein to autophosphorylate. Either the mutation leads to a conformational change that causes the protein to aggregate or the mutant has an impaired ability to accept ATP so that it is no longer capable of autophosphorylation in E. coli. Biochemical Characterization of the M120G Mutant C-subunit—Computer modeling suggested that N6(phenethyl)-ATP or N6(benzyl)-ATP would fit best into the newly available hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 1). To determine qualitatively which orthogonal analogs would be preferred by the mutant C-subunit (PKA-Cα-as1) an inhibition assay was performed. As seen in Fig. 2, the WT C-subunit was not inhibited by the N6-methylbenzyl and N6-phenethyl-ATP despite a 100+ fold excess of the analog to radiolabeled ATP, while only a slight inhibition of the wild-type kinase was seen for the analog having the smallest N6 substitutions such as N6(benzyl)-ATP and N6(cyclopentyl)-ATP suggesting that the WT C-subunit can bind to this analog to some degree. The mutant catalytic subunit, but not wild type C-subunit, showed a significant amount of inhibition by all of the cold analogs, with the N6(phenethyl)-ATP showing complete inhibition, and the N6(benzyl)-ATP nearly complete. The smallest N6-substituted analog also competed least well with the radiolabeled ATP. Kinetics assays were then performed using [32P]ATP, [32P]N6(phenethyl)-, and [32P]N6(benzyl)-ATP analogs to determine the Km and kcat. As summarized in Table 1, N6(phenethyl)-ATP and N6(benzyl)-ATP had the highest affinity for the mutant C-subunit (at least 15-fold better than for ATP), but neither was turned over as quickly as the wild type C-subunit with ATP. This may be due to a slower off-rate for ATP. The N6(benzyl)-ATP showed a 2-fold faster kcat/Km (0.53) than N6(phenethyl)-ATP (0.24). Other analogs, such as N6(cyclopentyl)-ATP, did not have a significant advantage over ATP (data not shown). The modified C-subunit still accepts ATP with a slightly lower affinity than the wild type catalytic subunit. The pure mutant protein has a high specific activity with ATP and Kemptide of ∼28 units/mg compared with around 20–24 units/mg for wild type catalytic subunit.TABLE 1Kinetics properties of the native C-subunit compared to the M120G C-subunit Assays were performed using [γ-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]phenethyl-ATP, or [γ-32P]benzyl-ATP and spotted on phosphocellulose disks.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7708-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab To characterize other properties of the mutant enzyme, we also tested its ability to bind to the RIα subunit. Formation of holoenzyme with RIα has an absolute requirement for ATP (18Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14015-14022Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3, the mutant is also inhibited by RIα in a concentration-dependent curve similar to the wild type catalytic subunit, demonstrating that the mutation of Met120 to Gly did not disrupt regulation of the kinase. The mutant catalytic subunit was also inhibited by PKI similar to the wild type catalytic subunit. In the presence of PKI, the rate of M120G decreased from 4.74 × 10-3 units/mg to 4.14 × 10-5 units/mg. This was similar to the inhibition of WT, which dropped from 3.10 × 10-3 units/mg to 1.63 × 10-3 units/mg. Having expressed a stable mutant of the C-subunit that accepts bulky analogs of ATP, we went on to specifically identify mitochondrial PKA substrates. The M120G mutant was incubated for 10 min with mitochondria purified from mouse brain and [32P]N6(benzyl)-ATP. The mitochondria were then pelleted, redissolved in lysis buffer, and run on a two-dimensional gel where the first dimension was separated on the basis of isoelectric point and the second on the basis of molecular weight (Fig. 4A). Initially, we focused on the low molecular weight proteins because they were best resolved. Based on our mass spectrometry analysis, three proteins were identified that had putative PKA phosphorylation sites (Table 2). These included a cytoplasmic protein, smoothelin large isoform, an ER protein, a homolog to the protein disulfide isomerase precursor A5, and the mitochondrial protein ChChd3. Of these we chose to focus on ChChd3, because it is of unknown function. ChChd3 is a previously uncharacterized protein that was shown to be a putative mitochondrial protein of unknown function that contains a coiled-coil helix, coiled-coil helix motif. The sequence of ChChd3 is shown in Fig. 4B. The peptides that were identified by mass spectrometry analysis are underlined, while the putative PKA phosphorylation sites are highlighted in red. The domain organization and localization motifs of ChChd3 will be described in a separate report.TABLE 2Best match proteins identified for spots 16, 18, and 19 Also indicated are the peptides sequences and the mass over charge numbers for the three peptides that were used to identify ChChd3.

A polyclonal antibody was generated, and confocal microscopy was used to visualize endogenous protein in 10T½ cells. The protein colocalized with MitoTracker (Molecular Probes) confirming that endogenous ChChd3 is a mitochondrial protein (Fig. 5). Next, we used the recombinant GST-ChChd3 for an in vitro kinase assays to determine whether in vitro phosphorylation by PKA was direct. Fig. 6 demonstrates that PKA directly phosphorylates recombinant Chchd3 with a stoichiometry of 0.3 mol of phosphate incorporated per mol of ChChd3. Although three potential PKA phosphorylation sites exist in ChChd3, Thr10 represents the most likely site to be phosphorylated. A GST fusion protein of ChChd3 T10A was generated and found to be a poor PKA substrate (data not shown).FIGURE 6Purified, recombinant GST-ChChd3 is a PKA substrate. The left panel is a Coomassie-stained gel (CB) showing recombinant ChChd3 and PKA. The middle panel is a Western blot of the ChChd3 protein (W). Upon phosphorylation, a change in mobility of the ChChd3 protein is observed. On the right is the resulting autoradiograph of the gel when exposed to film (P32). Assays consisted of glutathione resin-purified GST-ChChd3, [32P]ATP, in the absence or presence of wild type PKA C-subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Once we determined that ChChd3 could be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro, we next wanted to determine whether PKA could phosphorylate ChChd3 in cells. Because of the low endogenous levels of ChChd3 in HEK 293 cells, we were unable to detect phosphorylation of ChChd3 without using transient transfection (Fig. 7B, panel 1). Therefore, a FLAG-tagged ChChd3 construct was transfected into HEK 293 cells, and immunofluorescence was used to demonstrate that FLAG-tagged ChChd3 was localized to the mitochondria (Fig. 7A). Subsequently, HEK 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-ChChd3. After a 24-h transfection, the cells were stimulated with 100 μm CPT-cAMP for 30 min. The cells were lysed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation of ChChd3 was determined using a polyclonal antibody we generated to a peptide containing a phosphothreonine at position 10 in ChChd3 (Fig. 7B). A clear increase in ChChd3 phosphorylation was observed in the presence of cAMP (panel 2). This effect could be blocked by preincubating the antibody with the phosphopeptide (panel 3), but not with the unphosphorylated peptide (panel 4). Antibodies to the FLAG epitope and tubulin were used as loading controls (panels 5 and 6). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the mitochondrial protein ChChd3 is a substrate for PKA in cells when cAMP levels are elevated. Based on modeling of the ATP-binding pocket, mutating Met120 to Gly appeared to be the best candidate for accepting a bulky analog of ATP and for discriminating between the wild type and mutant C-subunits. Modeling also predicted that either N6(benzyl)- or N6(phenethyl)-ATP would be good candidates to fit into the engineered ATP-binding pocket. A bulkier substituted group will also prevent the wild type kinase from using the analogs, whereas some of the smaller substituents, such as of N6(cyclopentyl)-ATP, could be used to a slight degree by the wild type enzyme. The additional methylene group between the nitrogen and the benzene ring confers additional flexibility. A space-filling CPK model in Fig. 1 demonstrates best the occupation of the pocket by the benzene ring of the N6(phenethyl)-adenosine analog in the M120G mutant. The residues surrounding the benzene ring in a plane coming out of the page would not normally see any part of the ATP molecule in the wild type enzyme. The methionine residue acts as a “molecular gate,” as described by Shokat and co-workers (4Liu Y. Shah K. Yang F. Witucki L. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 91-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) of the Ile338 in v-Src. To understand why the mutant kinase would actually prefer the analog over ATP, as found in v-Src, the electrostatic surfaces in the mutant PKA were visualized using GRASP in Fig. 1. The opened pocket accommodating the N6(phenethyl)-adenosine in the M120G mutant is revealed as a fairly hydrophobic surface. The hydrophobic phenethyl group could easily dock into that pocket, possibly resulting in a faster “on” rate of the analog into the site. Certainly the complementarity would be good for the analog, while there would be a “hole” for the wild type C-subunit. However, the rate-limiting step for ATP turnover is its “off” rate (19Lew J. Taylor S.S. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6717-6724Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on the modeling, the M120G mutation was engineered into the Cα subunit of PKA. Expressing the M120G mutant in E. coli proved to be challenging. The protein initially was completely insoluble and unphosphorylated. This was surprising because the wild type C-subunit is completely phosphorylated when expressed in E. coli, and this mutant uses ATP fairly well compared with wild type C-subunit. The mutation may disrupt folding or may disrupt the stability between the two lobes. The methionine side chain projects out into the ATP-binding pocket between the small and the large lobes. It certainly disrupts the initial autophosphorylation event on Thr197 that leads to secondary phosphorylations in the C-subunit when the enzyme is expressed in E. coli. Phosphorylation of Ser338 is thought to be intramolecular (20Iyer G.H. Moore M.J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8800-8807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, we decided to attempt to co-express M120G PKA with 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1). PDK1 is an upstream kinase for many AGC kinases including PKA (21Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This protein is constitutively active, but it appears to be regulated by its proximity to substrates through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (22Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R521-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This PH domain binds to PI(3,4,5)P3. PDK1 binds to an FXXF motif on the C-terminal tail of PKA (23Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and its other substrates. PDK1 then phosphorylates PKA at Thr197. When PDK-1 was co-expressed with the unphosphorylated M120G mutant, the mutant became phosphorylated on both Thr197 and Ser338 and was consequently soluble. This technique has proved to be highly useful for purification of other insoluble C-subunit mutants. N6(Benzyl)-ATP was the best choice for specificity based on the kinetic analysis. The Km was similar to N6(phenethyl)-ATP but the turnover was faster. This is advantageous because the kinase will still be active. In other work done with this mutant published after this work was completed, it was found that this mutation of the catalytic subunit (M120G or M120A) also conferred specificity to a class of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-based inhibitors (24Niswender C.M. Ishihara R.W. Judge L.M. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28916-28922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The inhibitors are similar to the PP1 inhibitor found to be specific for Src family kinases (25Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). This engineered protein was then used to find direct PKA substrates by adding it to purified mitochondria with radiolabeled N6(benzyl)-ATP. The 32P-labeled proteins were detected by first separating on two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and then exposing the resulting gels to autoradiography film or a phosphorimager. Ideally, this mutant protein also could be expressed in tissue culture cells to probe for direct substrates; however, currently there is no good way of getting the ATP analogs into the cells. Crude preparations of mitochondria were used to identify PKA substrates. Partial contamination of endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm would account for the detection of smoothelin and protein disulfide isomerase precursor A5, respectively. An important question arising from these studies is whether PKA and radiolabeled N6(benzyl)-ATP were able to enter the purified mitochondria or whether ChChd3 was released into the cytoplasm during the preparation process. Two lines of evidence suggest that PKA is able to phosphorylate Chchd3 within the mitochondria. First, endogenous PKA was detected in the outer membrane and inner membrane space of highly purified, fractionated mitochondria. 4F. Ma and S. S. Taylor, unpublished results. Second, upon stimulation of HeLa cells with CPT-cAMP, an increase in phospho-ChChd3 Thr10 is detected in intact mitochondria by confocal microscopy. 5M. Darshi and S. S. Taylor, unpublished results. There are many different protein kinases in the cell. Nearly 2% of the human genome code for protein kinases (26Manning G. Whyte D. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6217) Google Scholar), and each typically has multiple splice variants. This makes finding actual substrates, not just “biochemically feasible” substrates, of a specific kinase difficult. The molecular modeling results demonstrate how similar the ATP-binding pockets are between Src family kinases and PKA. This demonstrates why efforts to create specific ATP-like inhibitors for kinases are challenging. Using ATP analogs that are labeled at the γ-phosphate with 32P, one can identify substrates specific to that kinase that is labeled. The direct substrates can then become specific targets for drug design, in addition to the kinase. Download .pdf (.19 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2066166330,"The functionally related ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ATM-Rad3-related) protein kinases are critical regulators of DNA damage responses in mammalian cells. ATM and ATR share highly overlapping substrate specificities and show a strong preference for the phosphorylation of Ser or Thr residues followed by Gln. In this report we used a polyreactive phosphospecific antibody (α-pDSQ) that recognizes a subset of phosphorylated Asp-Ser-Gln sequences to purify candidate ATM/ATR substrates. This led to the identification of phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl terminus of the minichromosome maintenance protein 3 (MCM3), a component of the hexameric MCM DNA helicase. We show that the α-DSQ antibody recognizes tandem DSQ phosphorylation sites (Ser-725 and Ser-732) in the carboxyl terminus of murine MCM3 (mMCM3) and that ATM phosphorylates both sites in vitro. ATM phosphorylated the carboxyl termini of mMCM3 and human MCM3 in vivo and the phosphorylated form of MCM3 retained association with the canonical MCM complex. Although DNA damage did not affect steady-state levels of chromatin-bound MCM3, the ATM-phosphorylated form of MCM3 was preferentially localized to the soluble, nucleoplasmic fraction. This finding suggests that the carboxyl terminus of chromatin-loaded MCM3 may be sequestered from ATM-dependent checkpoint signals. Finally, we show that ATM and ATR jointly contribute to UV light-induced MCM3 phosphorylation, but that ATM is the predominant UV-activated MCM3 kinase in vivo. The carboxyl-terminal ATM phosphorylation sites are conserved in vertebrate MCM3 orthologs suggesting that this motif may serve important regulatory functions in response to DNA damage.

Mutations in ATM cause ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), a syndrome characterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration, immune defects, and cancer susceptibility (1Chun H.H. Gatti R.A. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1187-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). ATM-deficient cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) and radiomimetic agents and exhibit cell cycle checkpoint abnormalities and subtle DNA repair defects. These combined defects in DNA damage signaling and repair are responsible for the 100-fold increased cancer risk associated with A-T, and most likely contribute to the neuropathologic abnormalities associated with this disease. ATM belongs to the extended family of highly conserved phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinases (2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). Within the mammalian phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase family, ATM is structurally and functionally most closely related to ATR (ATM-Rad3-related) (2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). ATM and ATR exhibit similar substrate specificities in vitro, and display a strong preference for the phosphorylation of substrates on Ser/Thr-Gln ((S/T)-Q) motifs. Other (S/T)-Q-directed phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinases include the DNA-dependent protein kinase, which mediates DNA repair by non-homologous end joining (3Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar); and SMG1, which is involved in both nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and genotoxic stress responses (4Yamashita A. Ohnishi T.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Outside of the minimal requirement of a Gln residue in the +1 position, a clear consensus phosphorylation site for ATM has not been identified. However, Kim et al. (8Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E.

Many of these factors are also substrates for ATR, although clear examples of substrate discrimination between these kinases exist (17Dodson G.E. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1692-1697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The current compendium of known ATM substrates suggests that the regulatory functions of ATM extend well beyond canonical DNA damage checkpoint and DNA repair pathways. Among the list of these noncanonical ATM substrates are chaperone proteins (valosin containing protein), translational regulators (4E-BP1), apoptosis modulators (BID), and transcriptional regulators such as E2F1, CREB, and the NEMO subunit of the IKK kinase that mediates activation of the NF-κB transcription factor (18Livingstone M.

Recent studies have suggested that the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins represent a potentially important class of ATM and ATR substrates. Six MCM proteins, designated MCM2-7 assemble into a heterohexameric, ring-shaped structure that is believed to function as the replicative DNA helicase during S phase (25Labib K. Diffley J.F. Curr.

The MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto chromatin during G1 phase in an ORC, CDC6, and CDT1-dependent manner and, once loaded onto chromatin, MCM2-7 recruits CDC45 and additional components of the replication machinery (27Takahashi T.S.

Bioessays. 2003; 25: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). MCM-dependent DNA unwinding is subsequently triggered, in part, by a series of phosphorylation events catalyzed by CDC7-DBF4 (29Sheu Y.J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Evidence of checkpoint-related functions for MCM comes from the observation that MCM7 is required for ATR-dependent checkpoint activation in S-phase and interacts with both RAD17 and the ATR cofactor, ATRIP (30Tsao C.C. Geisen C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4660-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In addition, ATM/ATR phosphorylation sites have been mapped in mammalian and Xenopus MCM2, and an additional ATM/ATR site has been mapped to Ser-535 of human MCM3 (31Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J.

However, the functional consequences of DNA damage-dependent MCM2 and MCM3 phosphorylation are not known. The identification and functional characterization of novel ATM substrates is a key to further understanding the physiologic functions of this kinase in mammalian cells. In previous studies we generated a phosphospecific antibody against Ser-121 of CREB, which is phosphorylated by ATM in response to genotoxic stress (21Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We subsequently showed that this antibody exhibits cross-reactivity with an ATM phosphorylation site at Ser-120 in the SV40 large T antigen (LTag) (33Shi Y. Dodson G.E. Shaikh S. Rundell K. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40195-40200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mapped SQ phosphorylation site in LTag was found to contain an Asp residue in the -1 position, which was also present in the CREB peptide immunogen (33Shi Y. Dodson G.E. Shaikh S. Rundell K. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40195-40200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggested that the α-phospho-CREB antibody may recognize a subset of ATM substrates harboring phosphorylated Asp-Ser-Gln (DSQ) motifs. In this report we describe the results of immunopurification and mass spectrometry experiments to identify ATM substrates using α-pDSQ antibodies. This analysis has identified a cluster of Ser-Gln phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl terminus of MCM3. We show that ATM directly phosphorylates the carboxyl terminus of MCM3 in vitro and in response to genotoxic stimuli and explore the effects of MCM3 phosphorylation on MCM complex integrity and chromatin binding. Our findings define the carboxyl termini of vertebrate MCM3 proteins as regulatory targets of ATM in response to genotoxic stimuli. Cell Culture and Antibodies—HEK 293T cells, HeLa cells, U-2 OS cells, and SV40 large T antigen transformed ATM+/+ and ATM-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. K562 cells were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). UV irradiation was carried out using a UVP CL-1000 UV cross-linker with a peak emission of 254 nm. Antibody suppliers included: Calbiochem (MCM3), NeoMarkers/Lab Vision (MCM7), BD Bioscience (MCM6), GeneTex (α-ATM), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (α-Myc 9E10), Upstate Biotechnology (α-tubulin, α-γH2AX), Cell Signaling (α-CREB), and Novus Biologicals (α-pCREB-121, referred to as α-pDSQ in this text). The ATM inhibitor, KU 55933 (34Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J. Green S.J. Martin N.M.B. Orr A.I. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Curtin N.J. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9152-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), was prepared in Me2SO and added to a final concentration of 10 μm 1 h prior to cell irradiation. Mass Spectrometry and Protein Analysis—Approximately 2 × 107 K562 cells were exposed to 20 Gy of γ-radiation (IR) and lysed 1 h later in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.20, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 20 nm microcystin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Approximately 4 mg of cell extract was then incubated with 15 μg of rabbit IgG or 15 μg of α-pDSQ antibody for 3 h. The immune complexes were isolated using Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and, after extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The separated proteins were visualized by staining with colloidal Coomassie Blue stain (Novex) and bands that appeared to be induced in the IR-treated sample were excised and submitted for mass spectrometry sequencing (ProtTech, Pittsburgh, PA). Immunoblots were performed as described (21Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Milli-pore) were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% dried milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson) and developed using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Chromatin fractionation of HeLa cells was carried out essentially as described (35Montagnoli A. Valsasina B. Brotherton D. Troiani S. Rainoldi S. Tenca P. Molinari A. Santocanale C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10281-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). HeLa cell pellets derived from ∼2 × 106 cells were extracted with CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (see above), and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as the soluble protein fraction. The remaining cell pellets (chromatin) were washed once with CSK buffer and then boiled in 2× sample loading buffer prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Whole cell extracts were prepared using a high salt lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.40), 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. DNA Constructs and Kinase Assays—A murine MCM3 (mMCM3) cDNA clone was obtained from Open Biosystems. The open reading frame of mMCM3 was PCR amplified using Hi-Fi DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and subcloned into pCMV-Myc (Clontech). A human MCM3 (hMCM3) cDNA clone was obtained in similar fashion and its open reading frame subcloned into pCMV-Myc. HEK 293T cells and HeLa cell transfections were carried out using calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), respectively. ATR siRNA transfections were carried out as previously described (36Dodson G.E. Shi Y. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34010-34014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ATM kinase assays were performed as described using G-361 cells as a source of ATM for immunoprecipitation (21Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A glutathione S-transferase-MCM3 fusion protein spanning amino acids 683-812 of mMCM3 was produced by subcloning a PCR-generated fragment into the EcoRI-NotI sites of pGEX-5X-2 (GE Healthcare). The following oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-GAATTCAGGAAGACACTGAGCAGAAGCGGAAAAGGAGG-3′;5′-GCGGCCGCGATAAGGAAGACGATGCCCTCAGTCTCCATGACC-3′. Proteins produced in the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli were affinity purified using glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) using standard procedures. All mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Purification of Candidate ATM Substrates Using Phospho-DSQ Antibodies—We have raised a polyreactive phosphospecific antibody (α-pDSQ) that recognizes phosphorylated DSQ motifs present in CREB (Ser-121) and SV40 LTag (Ser-120) (21Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Shi Y. Dodson G.E. Shaikh S.

In addition, this antibody detected several species present in extracts of irradiated K562 erythroleukemia cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting the antibody may detect additional ATM substrates. Consistent with this idea, immunostaining of IR-treated human U-2 OS cells revealed intense nuclear foci that were highly coincident with γ-H2AX, a phosphorylation target of ATM and marker of DNA double strand breaks (Fig. 1B) (37Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 38Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2390-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The pDSQ nuclear foci were also observed in CREB-deficient MEFs, indicating they represent a protein distinct from CREB (data not shown). These findings suggested that the α-pDSQ antibodies crossreacted with one or more DNA damage inducible ATM substrates in cellulo. In an attempt to identify these candidate ATM substrates, we performed large scale α-pDSQ immunoprecipitations using extracts prepared from untreated or IR-exposed K562 cells. Coomassie Blue staining of the resulting SDS-PAGE gels led to the identification of at least six bands (P1-P6), with apparent molecular masses ranging from ∼90 to 140 kDa, whose abundance was enhanced following IR exposure (Fig. 1C). We initially excised three of these bands (P1, P5, and P6) and sequenced derived tryptic peptides by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometric analysis of the P1 band yielded a mixture of peptides in which MCM2, a component of the MCM DNA helicase, predominated (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the P5 band was comprised predominantly of MCM5 peptides, whereas P6 yielded primarily MCM7 and lesser amounts of MCM3 and MCM6. The presence of the MCM complex was further confirmed when the P2, P3, and P4 species were sequenced. P2 contained mixtures of MCM2, MCM6, and MCM3; P3 contained a mixture of MCM6 and MCM3; and P4 contained a mixture of MCM4, MCM3, and MCM6. The presence of multiple MCM components in the α-DSQ immunoprecipitates strongly suggested that this antibody reacted with one or more MCM subunits in DNA-damaged cells. In addition to the MCM complex, the α-pDSQ antibody purified a number of other proteins with known or potential links to the ATM pathway. Peptides derived from MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 were identified in multiple bands. A complex of MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 (MRN) is required for double strand break repair and is involved in the recruitment and activation of ATM at double strand breaks (40Lee J.H. Paull T.T.

The α-pDSQ antibody also identified UPF1, a substrate of the ATM-related kinase hSMG1 that is required for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (4Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 50Ohnishi T. Yamashita A. Kashima I. Schell T. Anders K.R. Grimson A. Hachiya T. Hentze M.W. Anderson P. Ohno S. Mol.

Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4092-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), α-actinin 1, and the chaperone, HSP90 (Fig. 1C). p116U5 and α-actinin 1 contain DSQ sites and are thus candidates for direct recognition targets of the α-pDSQ antibody. The other purified proteins, including all three components of the MRN complex, lack DSQ sites and may be present as coimmunoprecipitating factors. Identification of MCM3 as a Phosphorylation Target of ATM—We reasoned that the presence of a DSQ motif may distinguish proteins that are directly immunoprecipitated by the α-pDSQ antibody from those that are indirectly coimmunoprecipitated as part of a larger complex. Among components of the hexameric MCM complex, MCM3 contains conserved DSQ sites in the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 3A). To test whether mMCM3 was recognized by the α-pDSQ antibody we immunoprecipitated mMCM3 from control or IR-treated MEF extracts and then immunoblotted the immunoprecipitated proteins with α-pDSQ. This analysis revealed that the α-pDSQ antibody reacted with mMCM3 in an IR-inducible manner in wild-type MEFs, but not ATM-deficient MEFs (Fig. 2A). The α-pDSQ antibody also reacted with hMCM3 that had been immunoprecipitated from irradiated HEK 293T cells (data not shown). In HeLa cells, the phosphorylation of hMCM3 was strongly induced by IR and, UV light and, to a lesser extent, by hydroxyurea (HU) (Fig. 2, B and C). These data suggested that the MCM3 subunit of MCM complexes is a relevant target for the α-pDSQ antibody in rodent and human cell lines exposed to diverse DNA-damaging agents.FIGURE 2MCM3 is directly recognized by α-pDSQ antibodies. A, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of MCM3. ATM+/+ or ATM-/- MEFs were exposed to IR (20 Gy) or mock irradiated and cell extracts immunoprecipitated with α-MCM3 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with α-pDSQ or α-MCM3 antibodies. B, phosphorylation of MCM3 in response to genotoxic stimuli. HeLa cells were exposed to IR (20 Gy, 1 h) or UV light (50 J/m2) and harvested at the indicated times. Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with α-DSQ and α-MCM3 antibodies. C, comparison of HU and UV light-induced MCM3 phosphorylation. HeLa cells were exposed to 3 mm HU or 50 J/m2 UV and harvested at the indicated times. Immunoblots were performed using α-pDSQ and α-MCM3 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) mMCM3 Is Phosphorylated by ATM on Ser-725 and Ser-732 in Vivo—The carboxyl terminus of mMCM3 contains SQ motifs at Ser-725, Ser-732, and Ser-738. The Ser-725 and Ser-732 motifs in mMCM3 represent iterations of the sequence KTDDSQE and only one of these motifs is present in hMCM3. However, the hMCM3 protein does contain an ESQ site that is positionally conserved with the Ser-732 residue of mMCM3 (Fig. 3A). To test whether the carboxyl-terminal sites of mMCM3 are phosphorylated by ATM in vivo, we transfected HEK 293T cells with Myc epitope-tagged mMCM3 expression constructs containing Ala mutations at Ser-725 and Ser-732. The transfected cells were then exposed to IR or mock irradiated and cell extracts immunoblotted with α-pDSQ. These experiments demonstrated that mutation of Ser-725 and Ser-732 abolished α-pDSQ immunoreactivity (Fig. 3B). The residual immunoreactivity present in HEK 293T cells transfected with the Myc-mMCM3 725/732A mutant was attributable to endogenous hMCM3. These results strongly suggested that phosphorylated Ser-725 and Ser-732 of mMCM3 are recognized by the α-pDSQ antibody in vivo. The ability of ATM to phosphorylate mMCM3 in vitro was also explored. We performed ATM immune complex kinase assays using a GST-mMCM3 fusion protein substrate spanning amino acids 683-812 of mMCM3. ATM strongly phosphorylated wild-type GST-mMCM3 in vitro, whereas Ala substitutions at Ser-725 or Ser-732 reduced phosphorylation by ∼50% (Fig. 3C). Combined Ala substitutions at both sites inhibited phosphorylation by 80-90% and incorporation of a third Ala mutation at Ser-738 reduced the in vitro phosphorylation of GST-mMCM3 to near background levels, suggesting that Ser-738 is also an ATM phosphorylation site in vitro (Fig. 3C). Finally, the phosphorylation of GST-mMCM3 in vitro required a functional ATM kinase domain (Fig. 3D). Thus, ATM phosphorylates the carboxyl terminus of mMCM3 on three sites in vitro, and two of these residues, Ser-725 and Ser-732, are also phosphorylated by ATM in intact cells following DNA damage. We also mapped the relevant α-pDSQ-reactive phosphorylation site in h"

Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Other functions of glutathionylation are the protection of proteins from irreversible overoxidation of cysteine residues and the formation of one GSH from one GSSG molecule without NADPH consumption. Accumulation of glutathionylated proteins under oxidative stress conditions has been reported for different cell types (1Shelton M.D. Chock B.P. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6850-6860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cellular concentration of Gsp in T. brucei is about 50 μm (12Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the insect parasite Crithidia fasciculata, the Gsp concentration is higher and can rise up to 2.5 mm in the stationary phase. In addition, the ratio between trypanothione and Gsp strongly depends on the growth stage of the parasites (13Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar). Gsp, but not trypanothione, is also formed in Escherichia coli when the bacteria enter the stationary phase (14Tabor H. Tabor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2648-2654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although trypanothione forms the basis of the parasite thiol metabolism, trypanosomatids contain also significant levels of free glutathione. In logarithmic and nearly stationary culture forms of bloodstream T. brucei, the concentration of free glutathione is 1.2 mm and 170 μm, respectively (15Shahi S.K. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Clayton C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which is even higher than the respective trypanothione concentrations (340 and 100 μm). In T. brucei isolated from infected mice, as well as in cultured procyclic parasites, the GSH concentration is 200–300 μm (12Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Promastigote L. donovani contain up to 1.8 mm GSH (16Wyllie S. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39925-39932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, the question arises whether the parasites employ glutathione only for the synthesis of glutathionylspermidine conjugates or also for the glutathionylation of thiol redox proteins. T. brucei mono-Cys-glutaredoxin 1 is a glutaredoxin-like protein with a CAYS motif replacing the CPYC active site of classical glutaredoxins. The biological function of the protein is not yet known. Related proteins from other organisms form mixed disulfides with glutathione (7Tamarit J. Belli G. Cabiscol E. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 386: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which may indicate a function in redox signaling. Yeast cells that are deficient in mono-Cys-glutaredoxin 5 (Grx5) are more sensitive toward oxidative stress and the protein has been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of iron sulfur clusters (19Alves R. Herrero E. Sorribas A. Proteins. 2004; 57: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). T. brucei peroxidase III is a cysteine homologue of the classical selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases (20Hillebrand H. Schmidt A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6809-6815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent reduction of a variety of hydroperoxides and is essential for both the mammalian and the insect stages of T. brucei (21Wilkinson S.R.

T. brucei thioredoxin catalyzes reactions typical for thioredoxins such as the reduction of ribonucleotide reductase and insulin disulfide (23Schmidt H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46329-46336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The parasite thioredoxin is probably kept reduced by the spontaneous reaction with trypanothione, because the completely sequenced genomes of T. brucei as well as T. cruzi and L. major do not reveal any gene for a thioredoxin reductase (24Berriman M.

Science. 2005; 309: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Tryparedoxins are small parasite-specific dithiol proteins with a CPPC active site motif. They belong to the super family of proteins with a CXXC motif, which comprises thioredoxins and glutaredoxins (25Reckenfelderbäumer N. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17548-17555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). T. brucei tryparedoxin transfers electrons from trypanothione onto different peroxidases (see above), as well as ribonucleotide reductase (26Dormeyer M. Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol.

T. brucei glyoxalase II catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactoyl-trypanothione, which is formed from methylglyoxal and trypanothione (29Irsch T. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22209-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Trypanothione reductase, the key enzyme of the trypanothione metabolism, is essential for the parasites (30Krieger S. Schwarz W. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Clayton C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It is responsible for maintaining a reducing intracellular milieu by catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of trypanothione disulfide. Here we report on the thiolation of specific cysteine residues as revealed by ESI- and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses of the parasite proteins after treatment with GSSG or Gsp disulfide. Materials—Recombinant T. brucei thioredoxin (Trx) with N-terminal His6 tag was prepared as described (31Reckenfelderbäumer N. Lüdemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1991; 44: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Tanja Schlecker, Dr. Thorsten Irsch, and Edith Röckel. Samples of human and Drosophila melanogaster thioredoxin reductases were kind gifts of Drs. R. Heiner Schirmer and Stephan Gromer. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, GluC, and LysC (sequencing grade) as well as GSSG were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Gsp disulfide and trypanothione disulfide (TS2) were obtained from Bachem. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, iodoacetamide, trifluoroacetic acid, and DTNB were from Sigma. Insulin-zinc complex from bovine pancreas was purchased from Serva. A stock solution of 172 μm was freshly prepared in 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. All other chemicals were commercially available reagents of the highest purity. Purification of Recombinant T. brucei Mono-Cys-Glutaredoxin 1—5 ml Overnight culture of E. coli Nova Blue cells with the pQE30 plasmid containing the grx1 gene (without the mitochondrial targeting sequence and with N-terminal His6 tag) 3M.

Krauth-Siegel, manuscript in preparation. were diluted in 750 ml of 2× YT (yeast tryptone) medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6. Expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 30 °C. After centrifugation, the cells were suspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) containing 150 nm pepstatin, 4 nm cystatin, 20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg lysozyme, and 0.5 mg DNase I and disintegrated by sonication. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto a 15-ml TALON® Superflow metal affinity resin (Clontech) column at 4 °C. The column was washed with 75 ml of buffer A followed by 150 ml each of 10 mm and 20 mm imidazole in buffer A. The His-tagged protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. Chemical Reduction of Proteins—Reduction of proteins except of T. brucei PxIII was achieved by incubating 20–300 μm protein with 10 mm DTT overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.2 (mono-Cys-glutaredoxin 1, thioredoxin); in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 50% glycerol, pH 7.0 (glyoxalase II); in 40 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (T. cruzi trypanothione reductase); and in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0 (tryparedoxin). 50–100 μm PxIII was treated with 150 mm 2-mercaptoethanol overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazol, pH 8.0. Excess reducing agent was removed by size exclusion chromatography on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. The thiol content of the proteins as well as the removal of the low molecular weight thiols was monitored using Ellman's reagent (DTNB) as described in the next section. Determination of Free Thiol Groups—The number of free thiol groups in the reduced proteins was determined photometrically with DTNB (ϵ412 = 13.6 mm–1 cm–1 (34Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar, 35Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar)). The reaction mixture contained 200 μm DTNB and 10–100 μm thiol in a 1:1 mixture of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5. Reaction of Reduced Thiol Proteins with the Disulfide Forms of Glutathione, Gsp, and Trypanothione—10–50 μm reduced protein in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5, was incubated at room temperature for 4 h with 0.25–5 mm GSSG, 0.5 mm Gsp disulfide, and 0.5 mm TS2. For assigning the binding site of Gsp to Grx1 by MALDI-TOF-MS, the protein was treated with 0.5 mm Gsp disulfide in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0. Completely modified peptides as the standard for quantification were generated by incubating the reduced proteins with 20 mm GSSG or Gsp disulfide for 48 h at 4 °C. Proteolytic Digestion of Proteins—Fully reduced proteins in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5, were treated with different concentrations of low molecular weight disulfides as described above. Iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 9 mm to alkylate residual free cysteine residues. The modified and unmodified proteins were digested with trypsin (T. brucei Grx1, T. brucei glyoxalase II, T. brucei tryparedoxin, T. cruzi trypanothione reductase), GluC (T. brucei Grx1, T. brucei PxIII, T. brucei glyoxalase II), chymotrypsin (T. brucei Trx), and LysC (T. brucei Trx) at a protease:protein ratio of 1/10 (w/w). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS as described in the next section. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The intact masses of modified and unmodified proteins were determined by ESI-MS on an API-QSTAR™ Pulsar instrument (Applied Biosystems) with a high pressure liquid chromatography system (HPLC; Agilent) on-line-coupled to the ESI-QTOF instrument. 100 μl of a 1 to 10 μm protein solution diluted with water was loaded onto a 50 Poros R1 trapping column. After 1.5 min of washing (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.4 ml/min), the protein was eluted into the electrospray ion source with 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 20 μl/min essentially as described in Ref. 36Rist W. Mayer M.P. Andersen J.S. Roepstorff P. Jørgensen T.J. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 342: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar. The QTOF instrument was calibrated with apomyoglobin (Sigma). The mass accuracy was better than 100 ppm. For relative quantification of thiolation, mixtures of known composition were evaluated, changing the amount of thiolated protein against the unmodified protein and vice versa (see supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). Peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS on a Bruker Ultraflex mass spectrometer. The peptide solution in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5, was desalted on a ZipTip μC-18 column (Millipore). The MALDI-matrix was prepared as a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1 v/v). A nitrogen laser (337 nm) was employed for desorption/ionization, and the ion acceleration voltage was 20 kV. The spectra from 400 laser shots were averaged. The instrument was calibrated externally with peptide standard II from Bruker, resulting in a mass accuracy of 100 ppm in the range up to 4000 Da. For higher masses a slightly decreased accuracy was observed (150 ppm). Data were compared with the theoretical masses of the proteins or peptides taking into consideration the possible modification of cysteine residues. Relative peak intensities of the different forms of a peptide were calculated by comparing the peak areas given by the SNAP (sophisticated numerical annotation procedure) algorithm of the program flex analysis (version 2.2) from Bruker, which searches for known patterns in the measured spectrum and performs its own internal base-line correction and noise determination. The SNAP algorithm calculates the monoisotopic peaks based on a fitting of the isotopic distribution of the profile spectrum placing isotope peaks within millidaltons of their true centroids. This procedure, which uses Fourier transform methods, allows the separation of overlapping and low-resolved isotopic patterns and a precise determination of the monoisotopic masses as well as the areas of the separated isotopic patterns. Suppression or enhancement of a certain peptide by thiolation was analyzed by measuring the unmodified and completely modified peptide alone and in mixture. Then the peak areas of modified or unmodified peptides were compared with the peak areas of peptides containing no cysteines as internal standards. For peptide sequencing by MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS, peptide fragments were generated by post-source decay, and fragment spectra were acquired on a Bruker Ultraflex mass spectrometer using the LIFT method. The precursor mass window was 1% of the mass of the parent ion. pH Dependence of the Reaction of T. brucei Mono-Cys-Glutaredoxin 1 with GSSG or Gsp Disulfide—Reduced Grx1 was prepared as described above. The protein was eluted from the PD10 column in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.5. The 50 μm Grx1 solution was titrated with 50 mm MES to pH values between 9 and 5 (at lower pH values the protein precipitated). 0.5 mm GSSG or Gsp disulfide was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The reaction was stopped by freezing the sample, and the intact mass of the protein was determined by ESI-MS. The degree of thiolation was estimated by comparing the peak intensities of modified and unmodified protein species. Formation of an Intramolecular Disulfide between Cys104 and Cys181 in Grx1—50 μm Reduced Grx1 was treated with 2 mm GSSG, Gsp disulfide, TS2, or hydroxyethyl disulfide at room temperature for 24 h in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5. Excess low molecular weight reagents were removed by size exclusion chromatography on a PD10 column. In addition, reduced Grx1 was incubated with 100 or 500 μm hydrogen peroxide at room temperature for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 units of bovine catalase. The thiol content of the protein samples was determined with DTNB as described above. Remaining free thiols were alkylated by adding 15 mm iodoacetamide, and the intact mass of the protein was determined by ESI-MS. The incorporation of carboxamidomethyl groups showed cysteine residues that are not involved in an intramolecular or a mixed disulfide. To further analyze formation of an intramolecular disulfide, the tryptic digests of the treated Grx1 samples were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS and examined for a fragment containing the linked Cys104 and Cys181 peptides. The identity of the disulfide-forming fragments was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS peptide sequencing and by the fact that the respective peak disappeared after the addition of 15 mm DTT. Assaying Potential Catalytic Activities of T. brucei Grx1—To analyze whether Grx1 can catalyze the glutathionylation of other proteins, 50 μm reduced Grx1 in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5, was incubated with an equimolar concentration of reduced peroxidase III or thioredoxin and 0.5 mm GSSG. After 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 min, and 4 h, aliquots were subjected to ESI-MS. To measure a possible deglutathionylation activity, T. brucei thioredoxin was glutathionylated as described above, and excess GSSG was removed on a PD10 column. 10 μm glutathionylated thioredoxin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5 and 8.0, was treated with 10 μm reduced Grx1. The ability of Grx1 to reduce protein disulfides was studied by incubating 50 μm reduced Grx1 with an equal concentration of oxidized tryparedoxin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5, followed by ESI-MS. Deglutathionylation and Reduction of Grx1—To elucidate whether other thiol proteins catalyze the deglutathionylation and/or reduction of the intramolecular disulfide bridge of Grx1, 50 μm reduced Grx1 in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5, was treated with 2 mm GSSG, which led to a mixture of glutathionylated protein and the protein with an intramolecular disulfide. 50 μm reduced T. brucei tryparedoxin or 5 μm D. melanogaster thioredoxin reductase and 200 μm NADPH in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5, were added. After 10 min, 15 mm iodoacetamide was added, and the samples were subjected to ESI-MS. To reveal whether GSH and trypanothione are able to reduce the intramolecular or the mixed disulfide of the protein, Grx1 treated with GSSG or Gsp disulfide was incubated with either 3 mm GSH or 0.8 mm TS2, 2 μm T. cruzi trypanothione reductase, and 4 mm NADPH in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/HCl, pH 7.5, and processed as described above. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—50 μm Reduced Grx1 was incubated with 2 mm GSSG for 24 h at room temperature and desalted on a PD10 column. CD spectra of reduced (14 μm) and oxidized (10 μm) Grx1 were recorded at 20 °C from 195 to 300 nm on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter in 5 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.5, with a 1-mm path length cuvette. Data were collected every nanometer with an averaging time of 2 s and a bandwidth of 1.5 nm averaging over four repeated scans. Thermal denaturations of reduced (112 μm) and oxidized (20 μm) Grx1 were followed at 222 nm by measuring the change in ellipticity at increasing temperatures from 20 to 95 °C at a speed of 0.5 °C/min. Data were recorded for each degree with an 8-s averaging time and a 1.5-nm bandwidth. Reduction of Insulin Disulfide by Glutathionylated T. brucei Thioredoxin—T. brucei Trx was reduced as described above and incubated with 5 mm GSSG for 72 h at 4 °C. Excess glutathione was removed by centrifugation through a 10-kDa cutoff Amicon filter. Reduction of insulin disulfide was measured essentially as described by Casagrande et al. (37Casagrande S. Bonetto V. Fratelli M. Gianazza E. Eberini I. Massignan T. Salmona M. Chang G. Holmgren A. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9745-9749Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In a total volume of 800 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, the assays contained 160 μm insulin, 200 μm NADPH, and 1 or 2 μm of glutathionylated and untreated Trx, respectively. The reactions were started by adding 535 nm human thioredoxin reductase, and the absorption decrease was followed at 340 nm. Intact Mass Determination of Thiolated T. brucei Mono-Cys-Glutaredoxin 1—Recombinant Grx1 was treated with GSSG and subjected to ESI-MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The untreated protein showed a molecular mass of 17,330.1 Da (Fig. 1A). The reduced and oxidized forms of Grx1 have theoretical masses of 17,330.9 and 17,328.9 Da. The observed mass of the protein with and without intramolecular disulfide was 17,328.6 ± 0.5 and 17,330.7 ± 0.3 Da, respect"
https://openalex.org/W2051508861,"More fish have been afforded US Endangered Species Act protection than any other vertebrate taxonomic group, and none has been designated as recovered. Shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) occupy large rivers and estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North America, and the species has been protected by the US Endangered Species Act since its enactment.Data on the shortnose sturgeon in the Hudson River (New York to Albany, NY, USA) were obtained from a 1970s population study, a population and fish distribution study we conducted in the late 1990s, and a fish monitoring program during the 1980s and 1990s. Population estimates indicate a late 1990s abundance of about 60,000 fish, dominated by adults. The Hudson River population has increased by more than 400% since the 1970s, appears healthy, and has attributes typical for a long-lived species. Our population estimates exceed the government and scientific population recovery criteria by more than 500%, we found a positive trend in population abundance, and key habitats have remained intact despite heavy human river use.Scientists and legislators have called for changes in the US Endangered Species Act, the Act is being debated in the US Congress, and the Act has been characterized as failing to recover species. Recovery of the Hudson River population of shortnose sturgeon suggests the combination of species and habitat protection with patience can yield successful species recovery, even near one of the world's largest human population centers."

Retinoic acid (RA) induces epithelial cell differentiation. The conversion of retinol into its active form, retinoic acid, requires retinol dehydrogenase enzymes. Here we show that AGS gastric carcinoma cells containing the lytic form of EBV infection have enhanced expression of a gene (DHRS9) encoding an enzyme that mediates conversion of retinol into RA. DHRS9 expression is also increased following induction of lytic viral infection in EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cells. We demonstrate that the EBV immediate-early protein, BZLF1, activates the DHRS9 promoter through a direct DNA binding mechanism. Furthermore, BZLF1 expression in AGS cells is sufficient to activate DHRS9 gene expression and increases the ability of retinol to induce the RA-responsive gene, CYP26A1. Production of RA during the lytic form of EBV infection may enhance viral replication by promoting keratinocyte differentiation.

Vitamin A (retinol), and its metabolites, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 2The abbreviations used are: ATRA, all-trans-retinoic acid; RA, retinoic acid; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HPV, human papilloma virus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; OHL, oral hairy leukoplakia; IE, immediate-early; TIK, telomerase-immortalized human keratinocyte; RT, reverse transcription; VCA, viral capsid antigen; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ZRE, Z-responsive element. 2The abbreviations used are: ATRA, all-trans-retinoic acid; RA, retinoic acid; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HPV, human papilloma virus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; OHL, oral hairy leukoplakia; IE, immediate-early; TIK, telomerase-immortalized human keratinocyte; RT, reverse transcription; VCA, viral capsid antigen; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ZRE, Z-responsive element. and 9-cis-retinoic acid, control a variety of essential biological functions including fetal development, reproduction, growth, and differentiation (1Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine, Raven Press, New York. 1994Google Scholar). The effects of retinoic acid (RA) on the cell are mediated through retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (2Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). Most cellular retinoic acid is derived from the inactive precursor, retinol. A series of enzymes are required to convert retinol into RA. Retinol is initially converted to retinal by alcohol dehydrogenase and short chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes (3Marill J. Idres N. Capron C.C. Nguyen E. Chabot G.G. Curr. Drug Metab. 2003; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Retinal is then converted to retinoic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenases (4Duester G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12221-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 5Napoli J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 139-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of the intact organism, the availability of RA in cells may be largely determined by the efficiency of retinol conversion within the cell (1Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine, Raven Press, New York. 1994Google Scholar).Given the critical roles that RA plays in cell growth and differentiation, it is not surprising that a variety of viruses are regulated by RA and/or have developed mechanisms for regulating RA signaling (6Ghazal P. LeBlanc J.F. Angulo A. Rev. Med. Virol. 1997; 7: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For example, treatment of undifferentiated human embryonal carcinoma cells with RA results in the cells becoming permissive for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (7Gonczol E. Andrews P.W. Plotkin S.A. Science. 1984; 224: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Angulo A. Suto C. Boehm M.F. Heyman R.A. Ghazal P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3831-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, RA activates expression of immediate-early and early lytic CMV genes in latently infected glioblastoma cells (9Wolff D. Sinzger C. Drescher P. Jahn G. Plachter B. Virology. 1994; 204: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The human papilloma virus (HPV) protein, E6, binds to the ADA3 protein and inhibits its ability to transactivate the retinoid target genes, retinoic acid-binding protein II and p21 (10Zeng M. Kumar A. Meng G. Gao Q. Dimri G. Wazer D. Band H. Band V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45611-45618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Treatment of HPV-16-infected cells with ATRA results in repression of the HPV 16 promoter, induces growth arrest and attenuates the growth promoting effects of EGF in HPV-immortalized cervical cells (11Faluhelyi Z. Rodler I. Csejtey A. Tyring S.K. Ember I.A. Arany I. Anticancer Res. 2004; 24: 807-809PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sizemore N. Rorke E.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4511-4517PubMed Google Scholar).Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that is associated with both epithelial and lymphoid malignancies (13Rickinson A. Kieff E. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia. 2001Google Scholar). As a herpesvirus, EBV can infect cells in either a latent or lytic form. While EBV infection of B cells usually results in one of the latent forms of infection, EBV infection of oropharyngeal epithelial cells results in the lytic form of infection and allows the virus to be efficiently transmitted from host to host (14Sixbey J.W. Nedrud J.G. Raab-Traub N. Hanes R.A. Pagano J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In immunosuppressed patients, uncontrolled lytic EBV infection in tongue epithelial cells results in a lesion known as oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) (15Greenspan D. Greenspan J.S. Conant M. Petersen V. Silverman Jr., S. de Souza Y. Lancet. 1984; 2: 831-834Abstract PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analyses of OHL lesions indicate that lytic EBV infection occurs in the differentiated upper spinous layer of OHL lesions (16Young L.S. Lau R. Rowe M. Niedobitek G. Packham G. Shanahan F. Rowe D.T. Greenspan D. Greenspan J.S. Rickinson A.B. Farrell P.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2868-2874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, differentiation of an epithelial cell line containing the latent type of EBV infection converts the virus to the lytic form of infection (17Li Q.X. Young L.S. Niedobitek G. Dawson C.W. Birkenbach M. Wang F. Rickinson A.B. Nature. 1992; 356: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, the lytic form of EBV replication is tightly linked to epithelial cell differentiation.The switch between latent and lytic EBV infection is mediated by the two viral immediate-early (IE) proteins, BZLF1 and BRLF1. BZLF1 and BRLF1 are transcription factors that together activate expression of all early lytic viral genes (13Rickinson A. Kieff E. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia. 2001Google Scholar). In this report, we have used microarray analysis to compare cellular gene expression in gastric (AGS) cells with latent, versus lytic, EBV infection. We show that transcription of the cellular gene, DHRS9, is highly induced by lytic EBV infection, and that this effect is mediated by the BZLF1 IE protein. The DHRS9 gene product is a short chain alcohol dehydrogenase that converts retinol to retinal. We demonstrate that BZLF1 binds directly to two sites in the DHRS9 promoter and that one of these binding sites is required for efficient BZLF1 activation of the DHRS9 promoter. Most importantly, we show that BZLF1 dramatically enhances the ability of retinol to activate the RA-dependent cellular gene, CYP26A1, in cells. These results suggest that EBV has hijacked the retinol metabolizing machinery to promote cellular differentiation and thus favor lytic viral replication.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—AGS (a gastric carcinoma cell line), HeLa (a cervical carcinoma cell line), and HT-29 (a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Wild-type EBV (B95.8 strain) expressing the green fluorescence (GFP) and hygromycin B resistance genes, and BZLF1- and BMRF1-deleted mutant viruses, were constructed as described previously (18Delecluse H.J.

AGS and AGS-EBV cell lines were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and Akata cells in RPMI 1640 medium. HT-29 was cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium (modified). All lines were cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 100% humidity, except for TIK cells, which were maintained in keratinocyte-serum-free medium (Invitrogen) with epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract added.Retinol Gene Induction Assays—For retinol gene induction assays, AGS cells were grown in Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with charcoal/dextran-stripped serum (Gemini Bio-Products) for 2 days prior to transfection with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). AGS cells were transfected with either 0.5 μg of BZLF1 or pSG5, together with 0.75 μg of the RARα and RXRα receptors, respectively. Twenty-four hours following transfection cells were treated with medium alone (with 0.1% ethanol), 10 μm retinol (Sigma), or 10 μm ATRA (Sigma). Cells were then harvested for cDNA synthesis at 24 h post-addition of retinol or ATRA. Retinol and ATRA were dissolved in absolute ethanol under reduced light conditions and added to cells daily.IgG Cross-linking—The B cell receptor of EBV-positive Akata cells was cross-linked with 50 μg/ml of anti-human IgG (Sigma) 48 h prior to harvesting of RNA for cDNA synthesis.Affymetrix Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from EBV-negative AGS cells, AGS wild-type EBV, AGS Z-KO, and AGS BMRF1-KO cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Affymetrix microarray analysis was then performed at the UNC Functional Genomics Core using Affymetrix human genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays. Data sets were extracted and analyzed using Genespring software comparing the panel of EBV-positive AGS cells to EBV-negative AGS cells.Plasmids—The BRLF1 and BZLF1 expression vectors contain the BRLF1 and BZLF1 genomic sequences, respectively, inserted in the pSG5 expression vector (Stratagene) under the control of the simian virus 40 promoter (a gift from Diane Hayward) (25Sarisky R.T.

Virol. 2004; 78: 4197-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using anti-EBNA1 (1:1000) (a gift from Lori Frappier, University of Toronto), anti-BMRF1 (1:250) (Capricorn), anti-BZLF1 (1:250) (Argene), anti-BRLF1 (1:250) (Argene), and β-actin (1:5,000) (Sigma) antibodies and an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA) Immunofluorescence—EBV-negative AGS cells and AGS cells infected with wild-type B95.8 EBV were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 100% ice-cold acetone. Cells were incubated with VCA-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (Argene) at a 1:50 dilution and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-mouse specific antibody conjugate (Molecular Probes). Cell nuclei were then counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) and visualized using a fluorescence microscope.Luciferase Reporter Assays—AGS and HeLa cells were transfected with FUGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were seeded at a density of 200,000 cells per well in 6-well plates and transfected the following day. Transfections were performed using 1 μg of total DNA (including 0.5 μg of expression vector and 0.5 μg of reporter vector) and cells harvested 48 h post-transfection. Luciferase activity was assayed using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as suggested by the manufacturer.Probes for Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—19-mer oligonucleotides representing potential BZLF1 binding sites (Z-responsive element (ZRE)) within the DHRS9 promoter were annealed and 5′-end labeled with 32P using the Klenow reaction (New England Biolabs). 19-mer oligonucleotides were as follows (potential ZRE sites are underlined): ZRE1 (5′-GATCCGTTGTGTCACAATGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCATTGTGACACAACGTGA-3′ (antisense)), ZRE2 (5′-GATCTGGGAGTGACTCACAGAGCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCTCTGTGAGTCATCACTCCCA-3′ (antisense)), and ZRE3 (5′-GATCAGAACCTGAGGATTCCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGGAATCCTCAGGTTCT-3′ (antisense)). A positive control of the methylated BRLF1 promoter oligonucleotide (BRLF1p) was used as described previously (32Bhende P.M. Seaman W.T. Delecluse H.J. Kenney S.C. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1099-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).EMSA—Radioactively labeled probes were incubated with in vitro translated BZLF1 (or pSG5 empty vector), generated using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. EMSA assays were performed as described previously (32Bhende P.M. Seaman W.T. Delecluse H.J. Kenney S.C. Nat.

Sequences of the oligonucleotides used to create the mutant ZRE2 constructs were as follows, ZRE2 (5′-GTGTCACAATGGGAGTGCATCACAGAGCAAGGAGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCTCCTTGCTCTGTGATGCACTCCCATTGTGACAC-3′ (antisense) (the mutated ZRE2 site is underlined)).RESULTSAGS Cells Infected with Wild-type, BZLF1-KO and BMRF1-KO EBV Have Lytic, Latent, or Abortively Lytic Infection, Respectively—To compare cellular gene expression in cells with latent, abortively lytic, or fully lytic EBV infection, we created a panel of gastric carcinoma (AGS) cell lines by infecting the cells with various wild-type or mutant recombinant viruses (expressing GFP and hygromycin B resistance genes in the viral genome) and selecting for cell lines which were GFP+ and resistant to hygromycin B. AGS cells infected with the wild-type control virus, designated B95.8-WT (18Delecluse H.J. Hilsendegen T. Pich D. Zeidler R. Hammerschmidt W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8245-8250Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), expressed the two immediate-early proteins, BZLF1 and BRLF1, as well as the early lytic protein BMRF1 (Fig. 1A) and the late viral protein, VCA (Fig. 1B). Thus, AGS cells infected with wild-type virus are capable of supporting persistent, highly lytic EBV infection. In contrast, AGS cells infected with the BZLF1-KO virus (in which the IE BZLF1 gene is deleted) (19Feederle R. Kost M. Baumann M. Janz A. Drouet E. Hammerschmidt W. Delecluse H.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3080-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) as expected showed no expression of the lytic viral proteins, BZLF1, BRLF1, and BMRF1, but did express the latent viral protein, EBNA-1 (Fig. 1A). AGS cells infected with the BMRF1-KO virus (20Neuhierl B. Delecluse H.J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5078-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) had an abortively lytic infection; they expressed both of the two IE proteins (BZLF1 and BRLF1) but did not express BMRF1 and could not support lytic viral replication, since the BMRF1 gene (which encodes the viral DNA polymerase processivity factor) is required for lytic EBV replication (20Neuhierl B. Delecluse H.J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5078-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Lytic EBV Infection in AGS Cells Activates Expression of the Cellular DHRS9 Gene—Using the panel of cell lines described above, we compared cellular gene expression in EBV-negative AGS cells versus AGS cells with fully lytic (wild-type virus), abortively lytic (BMRF1-KO virus), or latent (BZLF1-KO virus) EBV infection. Microarray analysis was performed with an Affymetrix whole genome microarray. 3R. J. Jones, S. Dickerson, P. M. Bhende, H.-J. Delecluse, and S. C. Kenney, submitted for publication. This analysis indicated that the DHRS9 gene was the most highly activated cellular gene (increased 10-fold in comparison with uninfected AGS cells) in cells infected with either wild-type virus or the BMRF1-KO virus (data not shown). In contrast, AGS cells infected with lytic-defective BZLF1-KO virus showed no change in the level of DHRS9 expression compared with EBV-negative AGS cells.To confirm that DHRS9 expression is increased in AGS cells infected with wild-type EBV and BMRF1-KO viruses, we performed semiquantitative RT-PCR using cDNA from EBV-positive and EBV-negative AGS cells. AGS cells infected with either wild-type virus, or BMRF1-KO virus, expressed considerably more DHRS9 than EBV-negative AGS cells or AGS cells infected with the BZLF1-KO virus (Fig. 2). These results indicate that lytic EBV infection induces DHRS9 expression in AGS cells and that this effect is likely mediated by one of the two EBV IE proteins, since it also occurs in cells infected with the replication-defective BMRF1-KO virus.FIGURE 2Lytic EBV infection induces expression of the cellular DHRS9 gene in AGS cells. cDNA was synthesized from RNA harvested from AGS cells stably infected with wild-type or mutant EBV. DHRS9 expression and BZLF1 expression was quantitated by RT-PCR analysis using undiluted or diluted (1:10) cDNA or no reverse transcriptase (-RT). β2-Microglobulin levels are also shown as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)BZLF1 Induces DHRS9 Expression—To determine whether the ability of lytic EBV infection to induce DHRS9 expression in AGS cells is mediated by BZLF1 or BRLF1, EBV-negative AGS cells were transfected with the SG5 control vector, a BRLF1 expression vector, or a BZLF1 expression vector, and DHRS9 expression was measured 2 days later by RT-PCR. AGS cells transfected with the BZLF1 expression vector expressed considerably more DHRS9 than cells transfected with the SG5 control vector or the BRLF1 expression vector (Fig. 3A). The results show that BZLF1 alone is sufficient to induce DHRS9 expression in AGS cells.FIGURE 3BZLF1 activates DHRS9 expression. A, AGS cells were transfected with the control vector, SG5, or SG5-based expression vectors for BZLF1 or BRLF1. Cellular RNA was harvested 48 h after transfection, cDNA was synthesized, and DHRS9, BZLF1, and β2-microglobulin gene expression was examined by RT-PCR analysis. B, HeLa, TIK, and AGS cells were transfected with the SG5 control vector or BZLF1 and analyzed as described for A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next investigated whether BZLF1 can induce DHRS9 expression in other cell lines. The cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa, and telomerase-immortalized neonatal foreskin keratinocytes (TIK), were transfected with the SG5 control vector or the BZLF1 expression vector, and DHRS9 expression was examined by RT-PCR 2 days later. As shown in Fig. 3B, BZLF1 clearly induced DHRS9 expression in HeLa cells, as well as TIK cells. The lower level of DHRS9 activation in TIK cells versus HeLa cells likely reflects the much lower transfection efficiency in TIK cells, as indicated by the lower expression of transfected BZLF1. These results indicate that the EBV IE protein, BZLF1, activates DHRS9 expression in a variety of different epithelial cell lines.DHRS9 Expression Is Activated by Lytic EBV Infection in B Cells—To determine whether lytic EBV infection also induces DHRS9 expression in a B cell environment, the lytic form of EBV infection was induced in the EBV-positive Burkitt’s lymphoma line, Akata, by cross-linking the cell surface IgG with anti-IgG antibodies as previously described (33Takada K. Int. J. Cancer. 1984; 33: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). EBV-negative Akata cells showed no expression of DHRS9 (Fig. 4). In contrast, EBV-positive Akata cells had a small level of DHRS9 expression in the absence of anti-IgG treatment (consistent with the low level of BZLF1 expression observed in EBV-positive Akata cells even in the absence of anti-IgG treatment) and had a much higher level of DHRS9 expression (as well as BZLF1 expression) following anti-IgG treatment (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that lytic EBV infection also induces DHRS9 expression in a B cell environment.FIGURE 4Lytic viral infection induces DHRS9 expression in Akata cells. EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cells (Akata) were treated with or without anti-human IgG to stimulate lytic EBV gene expression. Cellular RNA was harvested 48 h after cross-linking, cDNA was synthesized, and BZLF1, DHRS9, and β2-microglobulin gene expression was measured by RT-PCR analysis. RT-PCR results from BZLF1-transfected AGS cells are shown in the left panel as a positive control for DHRS9 expression; RT-PCR results from EBV-negative Akata cells serve as a negative control for DHRS9 expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)BZLF1 Activates the DHRS9 Promoter—Several different messages are derived from the DHRS9 gene and there are at least two different promoters driving DHRS9 expression (29Jette C.

To determine which of the various DHRS9 messages is activated by BZLF1, we used a series of different primers capable of distinguishing between the various DHRS9 messages to PCR amplify cDNA in AGS cells with or without transfected BZLF1 (Fig. 5A and data not shown). The results of these experiments indicated that BZLF1 induces a DHRS9 message in AGS cells, which was previously shown to be highly expressed in colon cells (29Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T.

https://openalex.org/W2047384616,"An increasing number of compounds able to potentiate the activity of mutants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel have been identified by high throughput screening or by individual search of derivatives of known active compounds. Several lines of evidence suggest that most CFTR potentiators act through the same mechanism, probably by binding to the nucleotide binding domains to promote the activity of the protein and then, with lower affinity, to an inhibitory site. With the aim of identifying the activating binding site, we recently modeled the nucleotide binding domain dimer and predicted a common binding site for potentiators in its interface. To validate this model experimentally, we mutated some of the residues involved in the putative binding site, i.e. Arg553, Ala554, and Val1293. The activity of CFTR potentiators was measured as apical membrane currents on polarized cells stably expressing wild type or mutated proteins. CFTR activity was elicited by application of a membrane-permeable cAMP analogue followed by increasing concentrations of potentiators. We found that all three mutants responded to cAMP, although the affinity of R553Q was higher than that of wild type CFTR. In R553Q and V1293G mutants, the dissociation constant of potentiators for the activating site was increased, whereas the dissociation constant for the inhibitory site was reduced. Our results show that the mutated residues are part of the activating binding site for potentiators, as suggested by the molecular model. In addition, these results suggest that the activating and inhibitory sites are not independent of each other."

We have previously described the cloning of an additional 1000 bp of upstream p53 sequences that we have demonstrated play a role in the regulated expression of p53. As described in an earlier report, we preliminarily identified that a member of the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EPB) family of transcription factors may play a role in regulating p53. Here we have demonstrated that a particular C/EBPβ isoform, C/EBPβ-2, efficiently binds to the p53 promoter and induces its expression in a fashion that reflects the pattern of p53 expression seen as cells are induced to enter S phase and is absent from cells that are defective in proper p53 regulation.

We conclude from these findings that C/EBPβ-2 plays a central role in the regulating of p53 transcription during the transition into S phase. The p53 tumor suppressor gene plays a central role in the cell in maintaining genomic stability by functioning as a sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes required for cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage (1Vogelstein B.

EMBO J. 1995; 22: 5638-5645Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that loss of wild-type p53 expression is an essential event in the genesis of cancer. Given that the p53 protein is a critical regulator of cell growth, its expression must be tightly regulated for normal cell division as well as for its ability to function as a tumor suppressor. p53 levels must be suppressed for normal cell division to occur (19Choi J. Donehower L.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which explains why p53 is found at low levels in normal dividing cells (2Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). When cells are stressed or damaged, p53 is rapidly induced. Several mechanisms exist to regulate p53 levels and function within the cell. It is becoming more widely accepted that the transcriptional regulation of the p53 gene plays an important role in regulating the overall level of p53 protein. This was recently illustrated by Takaoka et al. (20Takaoka A. Hayakawa S. Yanai H. Stoiber D. Negishi H. Kikuchi H. Sasaki S. Imai K. Shubue T. Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2003; 242: 516-523Crossref Scopus (735) Google Scholar), who demonstrate that interferon-α/β, an essential component leading to apoptosis in response to viral infections, activates p53 transcription, thus clearly implicating p53 in the interferon pathway. Likewise, it has been known for many years that the level of p53 is increased at the transcriptional level after growth factor stimulation of resting murine (21Milner J. Milner S. Virology. 1981; 112: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and human (22Reed J.C. Alpers J.D. Nowell P.C. Hoover R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Induced expression of p53 prior to S phase may serve as a mechanism for providing a rapid response to DNA damage during S phase. Until recently, the molecular basis for this transcriptional regulation has not been investigated. In view of these observations, we have focused on defining the mechanisms controlling p53 expression in response to mitogen induction. In a previous report, we characterized an additional 1000 bp of upstream DNA sequences and identified a number of new positive and negative regulatory elements. One of these newly identified elements, located ∼960 bp upstream from the transcription start site, was found to bind to a trans-acting factor in a cell cycle-regulated manner and found to be required for proper S phase expression (23Boggs K. Reisman D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that the transcription factor C/EBPβ (CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β) binds to this regulatory site on the p53 promoter in response to mitogen stimulation and serves to increase p53 promoter expression as cells enter S phase. Because C/EBPβ is a transcription factor that is critical for normal proliferation and differentiation of a number of cell types (27Johnson P.F. J.

Cell Lines—Murine fibroblast cells (Swiss3T3), generously provided by K. Miskimins (University of South Dakota), and mouse embryo fibroblasts prepared from wild-type and C/EBPβ (–/–) mice (32Sterneck E. Tessaroloo L. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2153-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), generously provided by Peter Johnson (National Cancer Institute (NCI)), were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. Murine breast cancer lines were provided by Esta Sterneck at NCI (HC11); Linda Sealy at Vanderbilt University (4T1); and Daniel Medina at Baylor University (FSK-3, TM40-A, TM-3). NuMuMg cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HC11 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin and 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. 4T1, FSK-3, TM40-A, TM-3, and MuMuMg were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin and 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. All media contained 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 3The abbreviations used are: FBS, fetal bovine serum; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; LAP, liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein. 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 6% CO2. Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—The 0.7 kbp contained the 672-bp murine promoter fragment cloned into the HindIII site of the pGL3-basic luciferase vector (Promega). The 1.7 kbp p53 promoter contained a 1672-bp KpnI-HindIII fragment isolated from the murine genome and cloned into the KpnI and HindIII sites of the pGL3-basic luciferase vector (33Reisman D.E. Eaton E. McMillin D. Doudican N. Boggs K. Gene. 2001; 274: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 5 × 104 cells in 24-well plates were transfected (TransFast Reagent; Promega) with the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter construct and 50 ng of Renilla driven by the HSV-TK promoter (pRL-TK vector) as an internal control. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were grown in serum-depleted medium (0.1% FBS) for 24 h followed by serum stimulation (15% FBS). To assay wild-type full-length 1.7-kbp p53 promoter activity in the presence of C/EBPβ isoforms (34Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), exponentially growing Swiss3T3 and 6629 (C/EBPβ-null) cells were transfected with increasing 1.7-kbp p53 promoter pGL3-basic luciferase vector with or without co-transfection of 0.25 μg of C/EBPβ-2 and 50 ng of Renilla. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity. The results were normalized to TK-Renilla expression. To assay the activity of the 1.7 kbp p53 promoter harboring a site-directed deletion or mutation within the –972/–953 site on the promoter, exponentially growing Swiss3T3 cells were transfected with an increasing concentration of the mutant 1.7-kbp promoter pGL3-basic luciferase vector with or without co-transfection of 0.25 μg of C/EBPβ-2 and 50 ng of Renilla. Cells were lysed at the indicated time points and assayed for luciferase activity using equal amounts of protein, as determined by Bradford assays. Reporter gene activity was normalized to TK-Renilla activity. Data are shown as means + S.E. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The –972/–953 cis-acting element carrying the C/EBPβ-binding site within the p53 promoter was either deleted or mutated using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The following mutant sense oligonucleotides were 5′-phosphorylated to generate the mutation: deletion (deleted nucleotides bracketed and in lowercase), 5′-CAAGTTCTTACTGCCTAACCCAGGACTAT ACAAGGCA[ttgggaaaa]AAATAGCAATGTTTTCTAG-3′; and mutation (altered nucleotides underlined), 5′-CAAGTTCTTACTGCCTAACCCAGGACTATACAAGGCAAGCTCTCTGAAATAGCAATGTTTTCTAGTTCTTAATCTCCATAAAG-3′. In Vitro Transcribed/Translated C/EBPβ Isoforms—C/EBPβ-1, -2, and -3 cDNA were cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter in vitro transcribed/translated using the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation protocol (Promega). Plasmid DNA template (0.5 μg) was transcribed/translated either in the presence of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) or with cold methionine. Non-programmed rabbit reticulocyte lysate was used as a negative control. Synthesized proteins were analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized after impregnating the gel with EN 3The abbreviations used are: FBS, fetal bovine serum; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; LAP, liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein.HANCE and subjecting the dried gel to autoradiography for 2 h. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice with a hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/μl pepstatin, and 1 μg/μl aprotinin). Nuclei were resuspended at 2.5 × 107 nuclei/ml in nuclear extraction buffer (identical to lysis buffer, except with 500 mm NaCl), gently rocked for 1 h at 4 °C, centrifuged at 10,000 revolutions/min for 10 min, and supernatant stored at –70 °C. The binding reaction consisted of 10 fmol/reaction [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer TM.1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 m KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and incubation on ice for 15 min followed by room temperature incubation for 15 min. The products were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE (0.045 m Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography for 30 min–6 h. To test for specificity, EMSA was performed with unlabeled specific and nonspecific competitors ranging from 10 to 50-fold molar excess of the labeled probe. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed using reagents in the ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif) on formaldehyde-fixed chromatin isolated from SWISS 3T3 cells. After shearing of the chromatin by sonication, samples were precleared with protein-G-agarose and incubated with antibodies. Complexes were immunoprecipitated and the DNA released, purified, and amplified by 36 cycles of PCR. Oligonucleotides used to amplify the putative C/EBP site in the p53 promoter were forward (5′-AGCGCTGGAGAATTCCTAGAGG-3′) and reverse (5′-CGAGATACTTGGTATCGCAC-3′) and yielded a 468-bp product assayed by electrophoresis through a 3% agarose (MetaPhor, Cambrex, Inc.). Controls included anti-RNApolII (positive), mouse IgG (negative), and a non-reactive anti-LAP (negative) for immunoprecipitations and random oligonucleotides for PCR. Western Transfer Analysis—Serum-treated Swiss3T3 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1.0% deoxycholate, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF) and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by sonication. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays, and equal amounts of protein (35 μg) were mixed with 2× sample buffer (140 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 22% glycerol, 6% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 100 °C for 2 min. Protein samples were separated by electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in 1× running buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.2 m glycine, and 0.1% SDS) and electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking with 5% powdered milk in 1× TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C, the membrane was incubated with 0.1 μg/ml primary antibodies (either polyclonal anti-C/EBPβ antibody (Geneka), anti-p53 antibody pAB421, or polyclonal anti-actin antibody) for 1 h followed by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-mouse or -rabbit Ig antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed extensively with 1× TBST, and the proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and by subjecting the films to exposure for 3–15 min. Northern Transfer Analysis—Total RNA (10 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The separated RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, baked, and prehybridized at 42 °C (2:1 ratio of Ambion ULTRAhyb and 50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt’s medium (0.1% Ficoll 400, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidine, 0.1 % bovine serum albumin), 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% SDS). Hybridization was to 32P-labeled cDNA overnight at 42 °C. Membranes were washed with 1× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA/0.1% SDS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, and 1 mm 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0), 0.5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA/0.1% SDS and 0.1× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA/0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Membrane was stripped in boiling 0.1× SSC (15 mm NaCl and 1.5 mm sodium Citrate) and 0.1% SDS prior to reprobing with GAPDH cDNA as a loading control. In Fig. 7, equal RNA loading was determined by staining the gels with ethidium bromide and visualizing 18 and 28 S ribosomal RNA. Filters were subjected to autoradiography for 1–3 days. In Vitro Translated C/EBPβ Binds to the p53 Promoter—Having previously shown (23Boggs K. Reisman D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that a nuclear factor that binds to a site on the p53 promoter at –972/–953 (Fig. 1A) contributes to cell cycle-regulated transcription of p53, we carried out a data base search for transcription factors that may bind the p53 promoter at this site. To identify the factor(s) that may be binding to this element, we entered the 20-bp sequence into the Genomatix MatInspector transcription factor data base. As described previously (23Boggs K. Reisman D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), three potential candidates (C/EBPβ, RBP-Jκ (CBF1), and Ikaros-2) were identified as potential candidates, but only oligonucleotides specific for C/EBPβ were able to block binding of this factor to the promoter. In view of these findings, we further examined the role of C/EBPβ in regulating p53 transcription. C/EBPβ is critical for the normal growth and differentiation of various cell types (27Johnson P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Ramji D. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35McKnight S.L.

Three protein isoforms of C/EBPβ are formed by alternative translation of three in-frame initiation sites on C/EBPβ mRNA (34Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell.

C/EBPβ-1 is the full-length form of the protein (38 kDa) that contains an intact N-terminal transactivation domain and C-terminal DNA-binding domain. C/EBPβ-2 (35 kDa) differs from C/EBPβ-1 by only 21 amino acids at the N terminus; however, the N-terminal transactivation domain is still functional. Both C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2 are transactivators, although only recently have studies addressed their functional differences. C/EBPβ-1 is the only isoform detected in normal human mammary tissue, although in breast cancer cells, C/EBPβ-1 is absent (34Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell.

C/EBPβ-3 (21 kDa) completely lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain and is thought to repress transcription by complexing with C/EBPβ-1 or -2 and inhibiting their ability to transactivate target genes (34Eaton E.M.

To confirm whether the factor binding to the –972/–953 cis-acting regulatory element may be one of the C/EBPβ isoforms, we in vitro transcribed/translated the three isoforms of C/EBPβ from pcDNA3.1 C/EBPβ cDNAs encoding C/EBPβ-1, -2, and -3. The in vitro synthesized proteins were used in EMSA to assay binding to the –972/–953 site (Fig. 2A). Although equivalent amounts of the individual proteins, as measured by Western transfer, were introduced into the DNA-binding reactions, C/EBPβ-2 demonstrated greater binding activity, as compared with either C/EBPβ-1 or -3. Anti-C/EBPβ antibodies are specific for the C-terminal DNA-binding domain, which is present and functional in all three C/EBPβ isoforms. In the presence of anti-C/EBPβ antibody, all three isoforms supershifted, and as above, the supershifted complex containing C/EBPβ-2 was much more prominent than either of the other C/EBPβ isoforms (Fig. 2A). The intensity of in vitro synthesized C/EBPβ-2 binding as compared with the other two isoforms indicates that C/EBPβ-2 interacts more effectively to the p53 promoter than the other two isoforms of C/EPBβ. Endogenous Nuclear C/EBPβ Binds to the p53 Promoter—Having determined that in vitro synthesized C/EBPβ can bind the p53 promoter, we proceeded to test for binding by endogenous C/EBPβ from exponentially growing Swiss3T3 cells. Anti-C/EBPβ antibody, specific for the C-terminal DNA-binding domain, when included in the DNA-binding assays resulted in a supershift of the bound complex (Fig. 2B). A C/EBPβ-neutralizing peptide, which blocks the ability of the C/EBPβ antibody to bind, prevented the supershift and demonstrated the specificity of the anti-C/EBPβ antibody. Also, a supershift was not seen in the presence of anti-p53 antibody when used as a negative control. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-C/EBPβ antibody demonstrated the association of C/EBPβ with the p53 promoter (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that endogenous C/EBPβ in Swiss3T3 nuclear extracts binds to the –972/–953 site on the p53 promoter. Because the anti-C/EBPβ antibody recognizes all three isoforms of C/EBPβ, these experiments cannot distinguish which form is binding. As described below, our results led us to conclude that it is likely to be the C/EBPβ-2 isoform. Reporter Gene Assays Indicate C/EBPβ-2 Enhances p53 Promoter Activity—To characterize the role of C/EBPβ in regulating p53 promoter activity, several approaches were taken. In one approach, we assayed the effect of the different C/EBPβ isoforms on the expression p53 promoter in transient transfection assays. Exponentially growing Swiss3T3 cells were co-transfected with the 1.7-kbp p53 promoter and either C/EBPβ-1, -2, or -3 (Fig. 3). When C/EBPβ-1 was co-transfected with the 1.7-kbp p53 promoter, it acted as a weak positive regulator and led to an enhancement of p53 promoter activity by ∼2.5-fold. The expression of C/EBPβ-3, a putative transcriptional repressor, resulted in a slightly reduced p53 promoter activity. Of all three isoforms, co-transfection of C/EBPβ-2 with the 1.7-kbp promoter had the most dramatic effect on promoter activity. When compared with cells only transfected with the 1.7-kbp p53 promoter, co-transfection of C/EBPβ-2 resulted in an elevation of p53 promoter activity by ∼15-fold (Fig. 3). Interestingly, increasing the amount of reporter plasmid in the transfection resulted in a gradual elimination of activation by C/EBPβ-2, presumably because of the presence of a vast excess of introduced target sequences that could not be bound by a limiting amount of input C/EBPβ-2. To determine whether the enhanced p53 promoter activity required the C/EBP recognition site at –972/–953, we tested the activity of a 1.7-kbp p53 promoter that harbored either a deletion or a mutation within this site. Prior to assaying the promoter activity, the –972/–953-deleted and -mutated sites were tested for their ability to bind C/EBPβ from Swiss3T3 nuclear extracts by EMSA. Both the mutated and the deleted sites eliminated binding of C/EBPβ (data not shown) (23Boggs K. Reisman D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and as a result, C/EBPβ-2 expression had no significant effect on either the mutated or deleted p53 promoter (Fig. 4). These results are in stark contrast to the 15-fold increase seen with the co-transfection of the wild-type full-length 1.7-kbp p53 promoter and C/EBPβ-2 (Fig. 3), indicating that the –972/–953 regulatory element on the p53 promoter is critical for p53 promoter activation by the C/EBPβ-2 protein. Reporter Gene Assays Demonstrate that p53 Promoter Activity Is Reduced in C/EBPβ-null Cells—As another measure of the role of C/EBPβ in contributing to p53 promoter activity, we asked whether cells devoid of C/EBPβ expression were deficient in p53 promoter activity. Mouse embryo fibroblast cells prepared from wild-type C/EBPβ (+/+) and C/EBPβ-null (–/–) mice (32Sterneck E. Tessaroloo L. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2153-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) were used in reporter gene assays to further characterize the role of C/EBPβ in regulating p53 promoter activity. Transfection of the 1.7-kbp p53 promoter into 6362 (C/EBPβ+/+) cells resulted in a 5–7-fold higher promoter activity as compared with the 1.7-kbp promoter activity in 6629 (C/EBPβ-null) cells (Fig. 5A). Likewise, p53 expression was undetectable in C/EBPβ-null cells, even in response to serum treatment and cell cycle induction (Fig. 5C). These results further support C/EBPβ being a positive regulator of p53 expression. Given that 6629 (C/EBPβ-null) cells have reduced p53 promoter activity in comparison to their wild-type counterpart 6632 (C/EBPβ+/+), we assayed the p53 promoter activity in the presence of ectopic C/EBPβ-2 expression in the 6629 C/EBPβ-null cells. The cells were co-transfected with increasing amounts of 1.7-kbp p53 promoter and constant amounts of either C/EBPβ-1, -2, or -3 (Fig. 5B). In the presence of C/EBPβ-1 and -3, promoter activity was not significantly affected in comparison to the 1.7-kbp promoter activity in the absence of C/EBPβ isoforms (Fig. 5B). Co-transfection of C/EBPβ-2 resulted in a >4-fold induction in p53 promoter activity relative to cells only transfected with the 1.7-kbp promoter. Taken together, these results indicate that C/EBP expression contributes to enhanced p53 promoter activity by binding to the regulatory site at position –972/–953. EMSA Demonstrates C/EBPβ Binds the Promoter in a Cell Cycle-dependent Manner—Because we previously demonstrated differential binding of trans-acting factors within the –972/–953 element on the p53 promoter in a cell cycle-regulated manner (Fig. 6A) (23Boggs K. Reisman D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that contributes to the regulation of p53 gene expression during the cell cycle and found that C/EBPβ binds to this critical regulatory element and enhanced p53 promoter activity in exponentially growing cells, we examined the binding pattern of C/EBPβ in arrested cells stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle. To assay for C/EBPβ binding the p53 promoter during the cell cycle, we tested nuclear extracts from arrested and serum-treated Swiss3T3 cells for the presence of C/EBPβ by EMSA both in the presence and absence of anti-C/EBP antibodies.

Rotation of the central stalk within the core of ATP synthase effects conformational changes in the active sites driving the synthesis of ATP. Mitochondrial genome integrity (mgi) mutations have been previously identified in the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of ATP synthase in yeast Kluyveromyces lactis and trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei.

Introduction of the homologous mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in yeast strains that lose mitochondrial DNA at a high rate and accompanied decreases in the coupling of the ATP synthase. The structure of yeast F1-ATPase reveals that the mgi residues cluster around the γ-subunit and selectively around the collar region of F1.

These results indicate that residues within the mgi complementation group are necessary for efficient coupling of ATP synthase, possibly acting as a support to fix the axis of rotation of the central stalk. The mitochondrial ATP synthase couples energy of the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, derived by respiration, to the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Mutations or drugs that interfere with this process can reduce the efficiency of ATP synthesis resulting in wasting of the energy derived from the respiratory chain. On a cellular level, uncoupling the mitochondrion can result in a loss of the membrane potential inducing apoptosis (1Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP synthase is composed of a membrane-bound F0 portion and a water soluble F1.F0 acts as a proton turbine, which drives the rotation of the central stalk in F1 effecting the phosphorylation of ADP. F1 has 3 catalytic sites formed by three pairs of α/β subunits, which are arranged as a sphere forming the core of the enzyme (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). The central stalk, composed of the γδɛ, is in the center of the core of F1 and is physically coupled to F0.F0 is minimally composed of abc10 with the c-subunits arranged as a cylinder in the membrane. A peripheral stalk formed by subunits b, d, h, and subunit 5, links the a-subunit to the periphery of the α/β core and acts as a stator, preventing the core from following the rotation of the central stalk (3Walker J.E. Dickson V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4Kane Dickson V. Silvester J.A. Fearnley I.M. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E.

Commun. 2006; 62: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The F1-ATPase is a molecular motor, which can drive the rotation of the central stalk with hydrolysis of ATP. This process is estimated to be nearly 100% efficient generating a torque of 90 pN/nm (6Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Rotation of the stalk is central to the mechanism of the ATP synthase where the active sites alternate between a state having a high affinity, with that having a low affinity, for nucleotides (7Boyer P.D. Cross R.L. Momsen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2837-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The eccentric γ-subunit rotates within the core of the F1-ATPase, sequentially converting the biochemistry of the catalytic sites through the catalytic cycle. Disruption of the interactions of the central stalk with the core of the enzyme is therefore predicted to alter the efficiency of the enzyme, i.e. uncouple the enzyme. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a facultative anaerobe and thus is viable in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation. The mtDNA 2The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; RCR, respiratory control ratio. 2The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; RCR, respiratory control ratio. encodes genes needed to express the genome and encodes subunits of the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase. Not surprisingly, yeast S. cerevisiae is able to lose mtDNA. Loss, or a major deletion of mtDNA, is defined as the cytoplasmic “petite” mutation. S. cerevisiae is referred to as “petite positive” because it is able to survive with the loss or deletion of mtDNA. Yeast Kluyveromyces lactis is also a facultative anaerobe but unlike S. cerevisiae, the cytoplasmic petite mutation is lethal and thus K. lactis is petite negative. A family of nuclear mutations, mitochondrial genome integrity (mgi), has been identified in K. lactis, which convert it from petite negative to petite positive. Without exception, these mutations map to the α-, β-, or γ-subunits of the ATP synthase (8Clark-Walker G.D. Hansbro P.M. Gibson F. Chen X.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1478: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nuclear mutations have long been known to exist in S. cerevisiae, which convert it to petite negative. These mutations have been identified in a number of genes including the genes encoding the ATP/ADP translocase (9Kovacova V. Irmlerova J. Kovac L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 162: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the PGS1 gene whose product is involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis (10Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Janitor M. Jarosch E. Schweyen R.J. Subik J. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the YME1 gene whose product is involved in the migration of mtDNA from the mitochondrion to the nucleus (12Weber E.R. Rooks R.S. Shafer K.S. Chase J.W. Thorsness P.E. Genetics. 1995; 140: 435-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in S. cerevisiae containing the yme1 mutation have also been isolated, which convert it from petite negative to petite positive. These mutations were mapped to the gene encoding the α- and γ-subunit of the ATP synthase and are homologous to the mgi mutations isolated from K. lactis (12Weber E.R. Rooks R.S. Shafer K.S. Chase J.W. Thorsness P.E. Genetics. 1995; 140: 435-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kominsky D.J. Brownson M.P. Updike D.L. Thorsness P.E. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei normally requires expression of the mitochondrial genome despite the absence of oxidative phosphorylation in this stage of the life cycle. However, there is a naturally occurring bloodstream form of trypanosome, dyskinetoplastic, that lacks mtDNA. This form has been shown to have sequence variation in the gene encoding the γ-subunit, which allows this bloodstream form of trypanosome to survive without mitochondrial gene expression (14Schnaufer A. Clark-Walker G.D. Steinberg A.G. Stuart K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4029-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Introduction of the corresponding mutation in yeast K. lactis converts it to a petite positive strain and thus, this mutation may be defined as an mgi mutation. There have been a number of hypotheses to explain the biochemical effect of mgi mutations on the ability of the cell to lose mitochondrial gene expression, as in the petite mutation in yeast. The mgi mutations have been postulated to decrease the proton permeable channel made by F0 (15Chen X.J. Clark-Walker G.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3277-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Chen X.J. Clark-Walker G.D. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1445-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to increase ATPase activity by decreasing the inhibitory effects of natural inhibitory factors (17Kominsky D.J. Thorsness P.E. Genetics. 2000; 154: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to increase the intrinsic ATPase activity of F1 in the absence of F0 (8Clark-Walker G.D. Hansbro P.M. Gibson F. Chen X.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1478: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), or by decreasing the Km for ATP of the F1-ATPase (18Clark-Walker G.D. Mitochondrion. 2003; 2: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whereas there is ambiguity as to the effect of the mgi mutations on the biochemistry of the F1-ATPase, there seems to be consensus that the petite negative phenotype is related to mitochondrial biogenesis, which if blocked, results in death of the cell (14Schnaufer A. Clark-Walker G.D. Steinberg A.G. Stuart K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4029-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Clark-Walker G.D.

Jensen R.E. Genetics. 2003; 165: 35-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding mgi mutations have been made and analyzed in yeast S. cerevisiae. Genetic analysis and vital staining of the yeast containing the corresponding mutations and biochemical analysis of the mitochondria derived from the corresponding strains indicate that the mutations uncouple the ATP synthase. Analysis of the crystal structure of the wild type yeast F1-ATPase suggests a structural role of the corresponding residues where these residues secure the axis of rotation of the central stalk. Changes in the axis of rotation of the central stalk are predicted to alter the interactions of the γ-subunit with the core of the F1-ATPase and reduce the coupling of the ATP synthase. These results provide information on the structure/function relationship for the residues classified as mgi. Yeast Strains and Genetics—The yeast S. cerevisiae strain, W303-1A (a, ade2-1, his3-1, 15, leu2–3, 112, trp1-1, ura3-1) (obtained from A. Tzagoloff, Columbia University, New York) was used throughout this study as the parent of the mutant strains. The percentage of cytoplasmic petites (loss or deletion of mtDNA) was determined after growing a single colony in YPD medium (3 ml) for 3 days, plating cells on YPD plates (about 100 colonies/plate) and incubating the plates at 30 °C for 3–4 days. The percentage of petites was measured by determining the percentage of white colonies (the petite strain does not turn red with the ade2-mutation (21Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Pittman D. Webb J.M. Roshanmanesh A. Coker L.E. Genetics. 1959; 45: 1023-1037Crossref Google Scholar)). The percentage of petite cells was confirmed genetically by mating the colonies to a tester strain (21Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), followed by testing for growth on YPG medium. The null deletion yeast mutants were made by homologous recombination of PCR products using the KanMX resistance module (24Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed by the LiAc method (25Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the α, β, and γ genes of yeast ATPase. The αN67I, αA295V, αF405S, βV279F, βR408G, βR408I, γT264A, and γI270T mutants were prepared in plasmids (pRS305, pRS304, and pRS306 (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the α, β, and γ genes, respectively) using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) (supplemental materials Table S1). Yeast media are standard recipes as described (27Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar): YPD, 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone; YPG, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 3% glycerol; YPAD, 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 20 mg/liter adenine sulfate. Minimal medium (SD) with 2% glucose was supplemented at 20 mg/liter with amino acids, adenine, and uracil. Isolation of Wild Type and Mutant Mitochondria—Cells were grown at 30 °C in a complete liquid medium containing 2% galactose and 0.05% glucose (28Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested during logarithmic growth phase. Mitochondria were prepared as described (29Guerin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (30Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Measurement of ATPase Activity—ATPase activity was determined by a coupled enzyme assay (31Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5634-5639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 30 °C. Oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity assay was performed after incubation (5 min) in the presence and absence of oligomycin (5 μg/ml). For determination of the Km and Vmax values, mitochondria were first diluted with an equal volume of isolation buffer containing 0.75% Triton X-100 (w/v). The rate of ATP hydrolysis by mitochondrial protein (2 μg) was measured at concentrations of ATP:MgCl2 ranging from 2 μm to 2 mm with 1 mm free MgCl2. Measurement of Respiration Rates—Respiration was measured as described (28Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 32Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1893) Google Scholar) at 30 °C, using 0.6 mg of mitochondrial protein in buffer (0.65 m mannitol, 0.3 mm EGTA, 3 mm Tris phosphate, 10 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.75) (33Rigoulet M. Guerin B. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with NADH (8 mm) and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (4 μg) as indicated. Membrane Potential Analysis—For vital staining of the mitochondria, the yeast cells were grown to the mid-log phase, yeast cells (106) were incubated with Rhodamine 123 (2 μm) in phosphate-buffered saline plus 20 mm HEPES, 1% glucose with shaking at 30 °C for 20 min, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 3–4 times. Stained cells (2 × 105) were analyzed by fluorescence-based flow cytometry (FACS caliber Flow Cytometer, BD Biosciences) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 nm. Stained cells were visualized and photographed using a Leica DMRB microscope. The mutations identified in K. lactis, S. cerevisiae, and T. brucei that act with the mgi phenotype are summarized in Table 1. The mutations cluster in both regions and on specific residues in the α-, β-, and γ-subunits. Assuming that the frequency for a given mutation follows a Poisson distribution, this clustering suggests that there is a very limited number of residues that when mutated, give an mgi phenotype. To gain a better understanding on the effect of these mutations on the biochemistry of the ATP synthase, we have made a subset of the corresponding mutations in yeast S. cerevisiae and tested the resulting genetic, growth, and biochemical phenotypes.TABLE 1Primary sequence comparison of regions of the α-, β-, and γ-subunits with the amino acid residues that have been identified in the mgi complementation group The mutations in the genes encoding the α-, β-, and γ-subunits (ATP1, ATP2, and ATP3) are shown corresponding to the mgi complementation group identified from K. lactis, S. cerevisae, and T. brucei (8Clark-Walker G.D. Hansbro P.M. Gibson F. Chen X.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1478: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Weber E.R. Rooks R.S. Shafer K.S. Chase J.W. Thorsness P.E.

Clark-Walker G.D. Steinberg A.G. Stuart K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4029-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The altered residues are indicated in bold and underlined. The mutations ATP1–75, ATP3–1, and ATP3–5 were identified from S. cerevisiae and classified in those studies as dominant mutations. The abbreviation used for T. brucei is T.B. Open table in a new tab The mutant genes were introduced into yeast strains containing a deletion mutation in the gene corresponding to that with the mgi mutation. The yeast strains also had a deletion mutation in the gene encoding the β-subunit (ATP2) of the ATP synthase. The atp2 mutation served two purposes. First, we re-introduced the wild type ATP2 gene as a chimeric construct with a His6 affinity tag on the amino end of the β-subunit (34Mueller D.M. Puri N. Kabaleeswaran V. Terry C. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The His6 tag allows nickel affinity purification of the F1-ATPase. Second, a deletion in the gene encoding the γ-subunit (ATP3) has been shown to cause the cells to completely lose their mtDNA, i.e. become petite (21Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of a null mutation in ATP2, the cells do not become petite (21Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), making analysis of the mgi mutations in ATP3 possible. The yeast, when grown on rich medium containing glucose as the carbon source, showed a strong sectoring effect (Fig. 1). The sectoring is due to the rapid formation of petite mutations in the presence of the ade2 mutation. Cells that are respiratory competent and that contain the ade2 mutation turn red after adenine is depleted. However, yeast with the ade2 mutation that have lost mtDNA (petite mutation), remain white. The result is that cells that form petites at a high frequency exhibit a red/white color sectoring. Whereas not always definitive, the color of the yeast can be used here to determine whether the yeast is petite. This rapid sectoring indicated that the mgi mutations induced a large percentage of petite mutations in the cell. This propensity to become petite is known to occur in strains with mutations that uncouple the ATP synthase (19Mueller D.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Xiao Y. Metzl M.

Table 2 shows the percentage of the cells that are petite after growth in YPD medium. The petite mutation was confirmed by genetic analysis by mating a wild type strain containing a cytoplasmic petite mutation with the test colonies. In each case, the resulting diploids from the white colonies were unable to grow on YPG medium indicating that the cells in the white colonies were petite. All of the mutations caused an increased rate of petite formation ranging from 15 to 44% of the colonies. This is a conservative analysis because the sectored colonies were classified as grande (nonpetite).TABLE 2Genetic and biochemical studies on the mitochondrial ATP synthase coupling capacity Cells or mitochondria from wild type (wt) and mutant cells, as indicated (column 1), were studied. The percentage of petite strains as the homozygous haploid (column 2) or heterozygous diploid (column 3) is shown. The mean of the fluorescence intensity of the cells stained with Rhodamine 123 (column 4), the respiration using NADH as the substrate in the absence of ADP (State 4) and the presence of the uncoupler, FCCP (columns 5 and 6), the RCR, (column 7), the velocity of ATP hydrolysis using saturating ATP:Mg in the absence and presence of 5 μg of oligomycin with the associated oligomycin sensitivity (columns 8–10), and the measurement of the membrane potential using ethanol and ATP to generate the potential (columns 11 and 12) are shown. In each case, two to three independent experiments (n) were preformed and the SE displayed. All methods are detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The abbreviations are: ND, not determined; NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab The effect of the mutations on the ability of the yeast to grow on complete medium with glycerol as the sole carbon source (YPG) medium is shown in Fig. 2. Cells that are defective in oxidative phosphorylation are unable to grow on medium that contains a nonfermentable carbon source, such as glycerol, but are able to grow on medium that contain a fermentable carbon source, such as glucose. There was a large variation of the effect that the mutations had on the ability of the yeast to grow on YPG medium. Some strains displayed near normal growth on YPG medium, such as that containing γI270T, whereas others were completely defective, such as that containing αA295V. The haploid strains were mated to a wild type haploid strain and the resulting diploids were tested for growth on YPG medium. This assay indicated that the mutations, which imparted a negative growth phenotype on YPG, were semi-dominant negative. The semi-dominant negative behavior was also displayed in the percentage of petite mutation formed by the heterozygous diploid strain (Table 2). A mutation can exhibit a dominant phenotype if the mutant protein is assembled into a complex that imparts a new activity that gives a negative phenotype. For mutations that uncouple the ATP synthase, the new activity is the free flow of protons into the mitochondrion and a negative phenotype is, for example, the slow growth on glycerol medium. The mutations are not entirely dominant negative, presumably because of the added capacity provided by the wild type enzyme to create a gradient via ATP hydrolysis and diminished overall level of the mutant enzyme complex. The prior phenotypes are indicative of mutations that uncouple the ATP synthase. To test this hypothesis further, the cells were stained with Rhodamine 123. Rhodamine 123 accumulates in the mitochondrion in response to a negative potential across the mitochondrial membrane. Partial uncoupling of the ATP synthase results in protons entering the mitochondria causing a decrease in the efficiency of ATP synthesis. Uncoupling of the ATP synthase would be predicted to decrease the potential across the mitochondrial membrane. Fig. 3 shows the staining with Rhodamine 123 with the wild type (WT), mutant (αN67I), and petite cells. The staining was moderately decreased in the mutant cells and severely decreased in the petite strain. A fluorescent-activated cell sorter was used to count and quantify the level of fluorescence in each cell (Table 2, fourth column). This analysis indicated that the cells from all of the mutant strains had a decreased staining and thus lower potential across the mitochondrial membrane. The decreased staining by Rhodamine 123 in cells containing the mutations is consistent with the mgi mutations altering the coupling of the ATP synthase. Biochemical analysis was performed on mitochondria isolated from the wild type and mutant strains to specifically address the coupling capacity of mitochondria isolated from the strains. Respiration was measured in the absence of ADP (State 4) and stimulated with the uncoupler, FCCP. The ratio of the uncoupled rate divided by the State 4 rate is referred to as the respiratory control ratio (RCR). The higher the RCR, the more tightly coupled respiration is with ATP synthesis. An RCR of 1 would indicate that the mitochondria are completely uncoupled. In all cases the RCR dropped, from 3.1 for the wild type to as low as 1.3 for the mitochondria from the mutant strains (Table 2, seventh column). Frequently, State 4 rate is higher for mitochondria isolated from the mutant strains indicating that respiration is stimulated in the absence of FCCP (e.g. βV279F, Table 2, fifth column). In some cases, State 4 rate is not any higher than that of wild type mitochondria, but there is a corresponding decrease in the rate of respiration in the presence of FCCP (e.g. βR408I, Table 2, sixth column). This decrease in respiration is likely due to the formation of petite mutations during cellular growth. Because the mtDNA encodes subunits of the respiratory chain, petite mutations decrease the overall rate of respiration in the mitochondrial preparation. The oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity can also be useful as an indicator of the coupling of the ATP synthase. Oligomycin binds to F0 and inhibits ATP hydrolysis by the ATP synthase, but does not inhibit ATP hydrolysis by the F1-ATPase when it is not associated with F0. Thus, an oligomycin-sensitive ATPase can indicate that F1 is bound to F0 forming an intact and presumably, coupled enzyme. A decrease in the sensitivity to oligomycin suggests that the ATP synthase is less coupled. Both the level of the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase and the percent inhibition by oligomycin decreased for mitochondria isolated from the mutant cells (Table 2, columns 8–10). The specific ATPase activity decreased from 2.6 for the wild type to a low value of 0.7 for mitochondria isolated from the mutant cells. The oligomycin sensitivity was 96% for the wild type and ranged from 86 to 26% for the ATPase for mitochondria isolated from the mutant strains. Thus, the activity of the ATPase and the oligomycin sensitivity were decreased in each of the mutant strains as compared with that of the wild type strain. The isolated mitochondria were also tested for the extent of the membrane potential generated through the respiratory chain (by the oxidation of ethanol forming NADH) or by the hydrolysis of ATP. In the former case, the membrane potential is partly dependent on the amount of the respiratory chain in the mitochondria and the leakage of protons back into the mitochondria, in this case presumably via the ATP synthase. In the latter case, the membrane potential is partly dependent on the level of the ATP synthase and on the coupling potential of the hydrolysis of ATP with the pumping of protons out of the mitochondria. In both assays, the membrane potential was decreased for mitochondria isolated from the yeast with the mgi mutations relative to mitochondria isolated from the wild type strain. The relative decrease in the potential was much greater, however, when the mitochondrial potential was generated with hydrolysis of ATP rather than with oxidation of ethanol (Table 2, columns 11 and 12). The initial high resolution structure of the bovine F1-ATPase defined the three catalytic sites based upon their occupancy: TP, DP, and E for bound adenine nucleotide triphosphate, adenine nucleotide diphosphate, and empty, respectively (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Whereas the yeast enzyme does not have the same nucleotide content, the structures are similar and comparable (accession number 2HLD) (36Kabaleeswaran V. Puri N. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5433-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, for the point of discussion, we will refer to the active sites of the yeast enzyme with the names corresponding to the equivalent sites in the bovine enzyme: TP, DP, and E. When discussing a single subunit, the nomenclature will be used based on the active site formed by that subunit, e.g. αTP and βDP. The positions of the mgi within the structure of the yeast F1-ATPase are shown in Fig. 4 (supplemental materials Movie 1). All of the residues lie in a region that is either directly or indirectly linked to interactions with the γ-subunit. The sites of interaction cluster into 2 regions: the collar region and the bottom of the α- and β-subunits (cf. Fig. 4A). The collar region, defined in the structure of the bovine F1-ATPase, is formed by a loop in the α- and β-subunits (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Because of the eccentric rotation of the γ-subunit, the plane of the collar is not perpendicular to the axis of the γ-subunit, but tilted at an angle of about 45°. The collar is hydrophobic and seems to form a"

The N1347S mutation prevented the death domain module binding stably to ERK in vitro and in vivo.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a stress-activated DNA-binding protein and transcription factor that can induce a set of gene products implicated in growth arrest, apoptosis, redox balance, and cellular repair pathways (1Harris S.L. Gil G. Robins H. Hu W. Hirshfield K. Bond E. Bond G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16297-16302Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because p53 is mutated or inactivated frequently in human cancers, much effort is centered on determining the mechanisms whereby mutations inactivate the p53 protein, determining which gene products mediate the tumor suppressor activity of the protein, and identifying the enzymes that activate the protein as a tumor suppressor. It is important to determine whether the p53 “activating” or “inhibitory” enzymes are also themselves mutation targets that stimulate cancer development. One key paradigm developed for p53 is that its activity in unstressed cells is held in check by an ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway that promotes the rapid turnover of the protein. A set of E3 2The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; AMPK, AMP kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, TNR receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; MAPK, mitogen-activate protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; CHK2, checkpoint kinase-2; DAPK-1, death-activated protein kinase-1; RSK, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase. ligases that can turnover p53 by promoting its ubiquitination include the ring-finger-containing proteins MDM2, COP-1, CHIP, and PirH2 (2Brooks C.L.

A promoter polymorphism in the MDM2 gene enhances cancer incidence thus highlighting the importance of identifying genetic changes that may alter disease incidence (37Bond G.L. Hu W. Bond E.E.

Cell. 2004; 119: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). A second paradigm centers around the concept that the stresses or microenvironmental changes that activate p53 and relieve the protein of this negative regulation are quite distinct and include agents such as hypoxia, acidification, glucose starvation, oncogene activation, genome instability, microtubule dys-regulation, type I interferon, exposure to irradiation, and viral infection (3Levine A.J. Hu W. Feng Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The enzymes that play a role in linking these distinct stresses to p53 activation are beginning to be defined and include distinct protein kinase types, including casein kinase 2 and ATM (4Lane D.P. Hupp T.R. Drug Discovery Today. 2003; 15: 347-355Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recent studies have interestingly shown that members of the calcium calmodulin kinase superfamily, including CHK2, AMPK, and DAPK-1 share the common feature of being genetic components of signaling pathways that activate the tumor suppressor activity of p53 (5Jones R.G.

These calcium calmodulin kinase superfamily members differ in that they are activated by distinct stresses and provide a common evolutionary link between cellular stresses and p53 activation. Further, ATM, CHK2, LKB-AMP kinase, and DAPK-1 activities can be attenuated by point mutation or by gene silencing in human cancers. The mechanisms driving p53 activation by phosphorylation is being defined by biochemical and genetic studies. In response to ionizing radiation, p53 is activated by an ATM-CHK2 signaling pathway that senses DNA strand breaks and leads to direct phosphorylation of p53 in its transactivation domain, p53 acetylation, and gene induction (8Craig A.L. Hupp T.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8411-8418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Lambert P.F. Kashanchi F. Radonovich M.F. Shiekhattar R. Brady J.N. J. Biol.

The LKB-AMPK tumor suppressor pathway responds to metabolic stresses by activating p53 and inducing phosphorylation at the ATM site at Ser-15 (5Jones R.G. Plas D.R. Kubek S. Buzzai M. Mu J. Xu Y. Birnbaum M.J. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanism whereby LKB-MPK fully activates p53 is not defined (13Hardie D.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Finally, the tumor suppressor protein DAPK-1 is a component of an oncogenic signaling pathway that mediates p53 activation (7Raveh T. Droguett G. Horwitz M.S. DePinho R.A. Kimchi A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanism whereby DAPK-1 activates p53 is undefined, but biological studies have shown that DAPK-1 can induce myosin light chain phosphorylation (14Bialik S. Bresnick A.R. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), autophagy (15Inbal B. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, three distinct physiological stresses known to activate p53 are now linked to three signaling components of the calcium calmodulin kinase superfamily that have the common feature of being genetic components of tumor suppressor pathways ATM-CHK2, LKB-AMPK, and DAPK-1. In an attempt to begin to define the mechanism underlying how the tumor suppressor protein DAPK-1 functions at a molecular level, we have cloned the DAPK-1 gene and have identified a previously unidentified germ line mutation in the death domain. The death domain of DAPK-1 was identified originally in a genetic screen to be one of four functional domains required for DAPK-1 to exert its growth suppressive activity (18Raveh T. Berissi H. Eisenstein M. Spivak T. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The death domain is thought to be a signaling module contained in pro-apoptotic proteins, including Fas, TNFR, FADD, and UNC5H2 (19Cohen O. Inbal B. Kissil J.L. Raveh T. Berissi H. Spivak-Kroizaman T. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 20Llambi F. Laurenco F.C. Gozuacik D. Guix C. Pays L. Del Rio G. Kimchi A.

One recent report has indicated that the death domain of DAPK-1 forms a docking site required for its interaction with ERK (22Chen C.H. Wang W.J. Kuo J.C. Tsai H.C. Lin J.R. Chang Z.F. Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), identifying the first binding protein for the death domain of DAPK-1. Our analysis on the effects of the novel germ line mutation on death domain function indicates the mutation alters death domain oligomerization and attenuates ERK docking and associated apoptotic signaling. These data highlight a post-translational mechanism whereby the DAPK-1 tumor suppressor activity can be quenched in response to signal transduction events. Further, the relatively high penetrance of the death domain mutation in germ line DNA from at least one population set identifies a signaling pathway mutation that might affect DAPK-1 activity in apoptotic diseases of the immune system, ischemic injury, and cancer. Potential study participants from the Southampton population with previously diagnosed truncating mutations of BRCA1 were identified from the data base of the Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, Southampton. Genomic DNA was obtained for 116 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 20 male and 96 female. Age at time of screening for BRCA1 mutations ranged between 29 and 57 years. The clinical histories of all subjects were reviewed to ascertain age at first and subsequent malignancies. 59 gene carriers had developed breast cancer, and a further 14 had ovarian cancer. 10 patients had undergone prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy (5 after developing breast cancer), and 3 patients had undergone bilateral risk reducing mastectomy. All malignancies occurred in female subjects; male subjects were therefore excluded from all analyses of cancer incidence. 102 anonymous genomic DNA samples (46 male, 56 female, age range 16-82), referred by the Wessex Clinical Genetics Service for genetic screening of non-neoplastic conditions, were obtained to provide an unmatched control group. Genotyping was performed using Pyrosequencing™ technology. Amplicons were generated in a 50-μl reaction volume with 15 pmol each of DAPK-Forward (5′-gtg cct tct cgc cat ga-3′) and DAPK-Reverse (biotin-5′-ata ggc ctc ctg gcc att-3′), as well as Reverse DAPK-SNP (codon 1347) (biotin-5′-ttg gga gcc ccg tta-3′), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 × Buffer II (500 mm potassium chloride and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) (Applied Biosystems), 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) using 10 ng of genomic DNA. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 7 min; 50 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s; 1 cycle at 72 °C for 7 min; and a final hold at 15 °C. Thermocycling was performed using a PTC-0225 DNA Engine Tetrad (MJ Research). Single-stranded bio-tinylated PCR products were prepared for Pyrosequencing using a Vacuum Prep Tool (Biotage AB). 3 μl of Streptavidin Sepharose™ HP (Amersham Biosciences) was added to 37 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20) and mixed with 20 μl of PCR product and 20 μl of high purity water for 10 min at room temperature using a Variomag Monoshaker (Camlab). The beads containing the immobilized templates were captured onto the filter probes after applying the vacuum, and then washed with 70% ethanol for 5 s, denaturation solution (0.2 m NaOH) for 5 s, and washing buffer (10 mm Tris-acetate, pH 7.6) for 5 s. The vacuum was switched off, and the beads were released into a PSQ 96 well plate containing 45 μl of annealing buffer (20 mm Tris-acetate, 2 mm MgAc2, pH 7.6), 0.3 μm DAPK sequencing primer (5′-GTGCCTTCTCGCCATGA-3′). The samples were heated to 80 °C for 2 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Pyrosequencing reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the PSQ 96 SNP Reagent Kit (Biotage AB), which contained the enzyme and substrate mixture and nucleotides. Assays were performed using the nucleotide dispensation order AGTACGCGC. The sample genotype was determined using SNP Software (Biotage AB). The C terminus of DAPK-1 (amino acids 1313-1431) was cloned into the Gateway system vector pDONR221 (Invitrogen) using the following primers: Fwd 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGGAAACTGAGTCGCCTGCTGGACCCG-3′ and Rev 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTGTCACCGGGATACAACAGAGCTAAT-3′. This vector was used as a template to construct DAPK-1 polymorphic variants using the in vitro mutagenesis system QuikChange (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer. HA-tagged ERK and MEK(EE) expression vectors were a gift of Steve Keyse (Dundee University, UK) HA-tagged DAPK-1 was a gift of Adi Kimchi (Weizmann Institute, Israel), and this allele (Asn-1347:Leu-1392) was mutated to derive the “founding” allele (Asn-1347:Phe-1392) and the “SNP” allele (Ser-1347:Phe-1392). The sequences of the primers used for mutagenesis are (bases which introduce amino acid change are underlined): amino acid 1347 S>N (Fwd 5′-CAAAGTACAACACCAATAACGGGGCTCCCAAG-3′ and Rev 5′-CTTGGGAGCCCCGTTATTGGTGTTGTACTTTG-3′) and amino acid 1392 F>L (Fwd 5′-GGATGCCGCAGACCTTTTGCTGAAGGCATCC-3′ and Rev 5′-GGA TGC CTT CAG CAA AAG GTC TGC GGC ATCC-3′). For expression of glutathione S-transferase or His-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli, pDONR221-DAPK-1 vectors were recombined with the pDEST15/pDEST17 vector (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. HA-tagged ERK was described previously, and p55-TNFR expression construct was obtained from David Dornan (Genentech). For expression in mammalian cells, the pDONR-DAPK-1 vectors were used as a template for PCR cloning into the p3XFLAG-myc-CMV-26 expression vector (Sigma), which has an N-terminal 3×FLAG tag and a C-terminal myc tag. The primers were designed to include EcoR1 and BglII restriction sites, and PCR products were cloned into the FLAG-myc vector at the same sites. The primers used were: Fwd 5′-TTGAATTCAAAACTGAGTCGCCTGCTGGACCCG-3′ and Rev 5′-TTAGATCTATCCGGGATACAACAGAGCTAATGGA-3′. HCT116 wt cells were grown in McCoy’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/H2O-saturated atmosphere. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells for transient transfection were plated out 24 h before transfection at ∼1.5 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish or 5 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish. For Lipofectamine 2000 transfection (Invitrogen), 2 μl of Lipofectamine was used for every 1 μg of DNA transfected. Cells were harvested after a further incubation of 24-36 h. Cells were lysed in ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove insoluble material. The protein content of cell extracts was measured using Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad). Typically, 50 μg of cell extract was immunoblotted. Samples were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis, typically 4-12% precast gels (Novex) and electrotransferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocked in PBS-10% nonfat milk for 30 min, then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C in PBS-5% nonfat milk-0.1% Tween-20. After washing (3 × 10 min) in PBS-Tween 20, the blot was incubated with secondary antibody, either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Dako, 1:5000), for 1 h at room temperature in PBS-5% nonfat milk-0.1% Tween 20. After washing (3 × 10 min) in PBS-Tween 20, proteins were visualized by incubation with ECL reagent (Sigma). Equal protein loading was confirmed with Ponceau S staining. FLAG antibody (M2) and FLAG M2-conjugated agarose were purchased from Sigma. Myc antibody (9E10) was purchased from Cancer Research UK. HA and PARP antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. The anti-HA antibody is from Upstate (07-221), the anti-ERK anti-body (9102), anti-phospho-ERK (9101), and anti-PARP antibody (9542) are from Cell Signaling. 16 h post-transfection, HCT116wt cells expressing FLAG-myc-tagged DAPK-1 proteins were cross-linked with 2 mm EGS (Pierce) for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/H2O-saturated atmosphere. Cross-linking was terminated by washing cells in PBS and harvesting. For immunoprecipitation of cross-linked proteins, 30 μl of FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation, together with 500 μl of cell extract (∼1 mg) prepared in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). The bead pellets were then washed five times in lysis buffer before resuspension in 100 μl of FLAG peptide elution buffer (0.25 μg/μl FLAG peptide (Sigma) resuspended in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and mixed with constant rotation for 2 h. Eluted proteins were then resuspended in 3× SDS-loading buffer and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies specific to the myc tag. For immunoprecipitation of exogenous HA-ERK from HCT116 wt cells, HA antibody (Cell Signaling) was incubated with 30 μl of washed Protein G beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation, together with cell extract (∼1 μg) diluted to a volume of 500 μl in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). The bead pellets were then washed five times in extraction buffer before being resuspended in 3× SDS-loading buffer and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. To monitor PARP cleavage, HEK293 cells or HCT116 wt cells were seeded and transfected 24 h later with vectors encoding the respective death domain modules (5 μg, Asn-1347:Phe-1392 or Ser-1347: Phe-1392), empty vector control, together with p55-TNFR (0.5 μg), or DAPK-1, ERK, and MEK(EE) vectors (1 μg of each). 16 h post-transfection cells were harvested and immunoblotted for PARP cleavage of FLAG-tagged death domain expression. TUNEL Assay—HCT116wt or HEK293 cells were seeded directly onto cover slips in 6-well plates. 18 h later cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression vectors for a further 24 h. Following transfection cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Apoptotic cells were labeled using Apoptag Plus Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit S7111 (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer’s instruction and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Annexin V staining—HCT116wt cells were seeded into 6-well plates. 18 h later cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression vectors for a further 24 h. To include any floating cells, media was collected into fluorescence-activated cell sorting tubes and centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 4 min to leave a cell pellet. Media was then discarded from tubes. Petri dishes were washed with 2 ml of PBS, PBS was discarded, and then 1.5 ml of trypsin was added to each plate and the mixture was incubated until cells became detached. Following cell detachment 1.5 ml of McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum was added to each plate to stop the trypsin. The cell suspensions were then added to each of the relevant cell pellets from the floating cells. Samples were centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 4 min, pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged for a further 4 min at 1700 rpm prior to resuspension in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. Samples were centrifuged for a further 4 min at 1700 rpm. Apoptotic cells were detected using TACS Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instruction and analyzed by flow cytometry. PARP Cleavage—HEK293 cells were seeded into 6-cm plates. 18 h later cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression vectors (DAPK-1, ERK, and MEK (EE)) for a further 24 h. Cells were lysed in ice-cold TNN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, phosphatase inhibitor mixture, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 30 min on ice prior to centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were then resolved by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and proteins were detected using Rabbit polyclonal antibody to PARP (Cell Signaling #9542). To examine effects of the death domain mutation on its oli-gomerization in vitro, a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (Tricon) high performance gel filtration column was equilibrated with buffer (PBS, 5% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine pre-filtrated with a Millipore filter 0.22 μm). Sample containing the purified recombinant death domain protein (800 μg) was injected and eluted into fractions of 1 ml each. The amount of protein eluted into each fraction was then quantified using Bradford assay. The equipment employed in the gel filtration was AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and fraction collector FRAC-950 (Amersham Biosciences). The software used was UNICORN version 4.10 (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular weight markers were obtained from Sigma. A 96-well microtiter plate (Corning Inc.) was coated with purified DAPK death domain protein diluted in 0.1 m Na2HCO3, pH 8.0, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Each well was washed 6× with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation in PBS-T supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin. The wells were washed 6× with PBS-T prior to incubation with appropriate amounts of purified ERK protein (Upstate) diluted in PBS-T 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h incubation the plate was washed again 6× with PBS-T and incubated with antibody specific to ERK (p44/42 MAPK anti-body #9102, Cell Signaling) for 1 h at room temperature. Following a further 6× washes with PBS-T wells were incubated with secondary rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibodies followed by further washing and ECL. The results were quantified using Fluoroskan Ascent FL equipment (Labsystems) and analyzed with Ascent Software version 2.4.1 (Labsystems). Asn → Ser Mutations at Codon 1347 in the Death Domain Attenuate ERK Binding—Upon cloning and sequencing of the DAPK-1 gene cloned from total RNA of a tumor cell line, we identified two mutations in the death domain that differed from the original wild-type sequence (Fig. 1). These two mutations include an Asn → Ser mutation at codon 1347 and an Leu → Phe mutation at codon 1392. To determine whether the Asn → Ser mutation at codon 1347 or the Leu → Phe mutation at codon 1392 alters the function of the death domain, biochemical characterization was initiated. The only direct biochemical function defined for the death domain of DAPK-1 is that it functions as an ERK docking site leading to phosphorylation at amino acid 735 (22Chen C.H. Wang W.J. Kuo J.C. Tsai H.C. Lin J.R. Chang Z.F. Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mutation of the ERK docking site on DAPK-1 from 1392-LXL-1394 to 1392-AXA-1394 attenuates ERK binding (22Chen C.H. Wang W.J. Kuo J.C. Tsai H.C. Lin J.R. Chang Z.F. Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This latter characterization utilized the Leu-1392 allele of DAPK-1 that differs from the gene we have cloned harboring the Phe-1392 codon. It is possible that the L to F mutation at codon 1392 alters ERK binding either positively or negatively, and we first determined whether the L to F mutation altered ERK binding. The transfection of the minimal death domain alleles, Asn-1347:Leu-1392 or Asn-1347:Phe-1392, did not alter the ability of the death domain to co-immunoprecipitate with transfected HA-tagged ERK (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3 versus 1). These data suggest that the original identification of ERK as a death domain binding protein at the LXL motif is not altered by the Phe-1392 substitution.FIGURE 2The N1347S mutation in the death domain of DAPK-1 attenuates ERK binding. A, ERK binding to codon 1392 death domain variants. HA-tagged ERK and FLAG-tagged death domain expression vectors were transfected into cells as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” ERK was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted for (i) total ERK protein (HA-immunoblot) and (ii) immunoprecipitated death domain using an anti-FLAG IgG immunoblot. The input death domain was quantified using an anti-FLAG IgG, as indicated (top panel). B, steady-state levels of the Asn-1347 and Ser-1347 death domain modules. Vectors encoding the indicated Asn-1347 and Ser-1347 alleles of the death domain were transfected into cells and immunoblotted to examine for general changes in steady state levels. C, examination of ERK binding to codon 1347 death domain mutants. HA-tagged ERK and FLAG-tagged Asn-1347 and Ser-1347 alleles of the death domain expression vectors were transfected into cells as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Total ERK and death domain were immunoblotted, and the amount of proteins present after immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-HA IgG for ERK and an anti-FLAG IgG for the death domain. The top panel represents total protein in lysate by direct blotting, and the bottom panel represents protein purified in complex by co-precipitation. D, purification of recombinant death domain miniproteins. Death domain miniproteins were expressed and purified using nickel-chelate chromatography as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (lane 2, Asn-1347 death domain; lane 4, mutant Ser-1347 death domain). E, quantitation of complex formation between ERK and death domain miniproteins. Purified death domain miniproteins were adsorbed on the solid phase and increasing amounts of ERK proteins were titrated into reactions and added to microtiter wells to allow complex formation. The amount of ERK bound is represented as relative light units as a function of increasing ERK protein titrated.View Large Imag"

Activators of the bacterialσ54-RNAP are AAA+ proteins that couple ATP hydrolysis to restructure the σ54-RNAP promoter complex. Structures of the σ54 activator PspF AAA+ domain (PspF1–275) bound to σ54 show two loop structures proximal to σ54 as follows: the σ54 contacting the GAFTGA loop 1 structure and loop 2 that classifies σ54 activators as pre-sensor 1 β-hairpin AAA+ proteins. We report activities for PspF1–275 mutated in the AAA+ conserved sensor I threonine/asparagine motif (PspF1–275T148A, PspF1–275N149A, and PspF1–275N149S) within the second region of homology. We show that sensor I asparagine plays a direct role in ATP hydrolysis. However, low hydrolysis rates are sufficient for functional output in vitro. In contrast, PspF1–275T148A has severe defects at the distinct step of σ54 promoter restructuring. This defect is not because of the failure of PspF1–275T148A to stably engage with the closed σ54 promoter, indicating (i) an important role in ATP hydrolysis-associated motions during energy coupling for remodeling and (ii) distinguishing PspF1–275T148A from PspF1–275 variants involved in signaling to the GAFTGA loop 1, which fail to stably engage with the promoter. Activities of loop 2 PspF1–275 variants are similar to those of PspF1–275T148A suggesting a functional signaling link between Thr148 and loop 2. In PspF1–275 this link relies on the conserved nucleotide state-dependent interaction between the Walker B residue Glu108 and Thr148. We propose that hydrolysis is relayed via Thr148 to loop 2 creating motions that provide mechanical force to the GAFTGA loop 1 that contacts σ54.

We propose that hydrolysis is relayed via Thr148 to loop 2 creating motions that provide mechanical force to the GAFTGA loop 1 that contacts σ54. Regulation of transcription enables cells to adapt and differentiate through coordination of protein synthesis. Two major mechanisms exist to control gene transcription as follows: one through recruitment to or preventing the RNA polymerase (RNAP) 4The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; EBP, enhancer-binding proteins; SRH, second region of homology; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; PDB, Protein Data Bank; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). binding to promoter DNA and one through activation or inhibition of the RNA polymerase activity. Despite the variations in subunit numbers that constitute the basal transcription machinery, RNA polymerases are structurally and functionally highly conserved in all kingdoms of life (1Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). During the initiation of transcription, RNA polymerases invariably melt the promoter DNA and have to engage the single-stranded template DNA in the structurally conserved catalytic cleft (2Kapanidis A.N. Margeat E. Ho S.O. Kortkhonjia E. Weiss S. Ebright R.H. Science. 2006; 314: 1144-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The major variant bacterial σ54-RNAP is regulated by an activating mechanism with some resemblance to the operation of eukaryotic RNAP II. In both cases, passing from the closed to the open RNAP promoter complex requires activator proteins that hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphate to drive open RNAP promoter complex formation (3Lin Y.C. Choi W.S. Gralla J.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The σ54-RNAP binds to specific promoter sites centered on positions -24 and -12 relative to the transcription start site and remains in a transcriptionally silent conformation. Open complexes of the σ54-RNAP promoter complexes are thermodynamically labile, and activation relies on the productive coupling of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis (energy coupling) from σ54 activators to the σ54-RNAP promoter complex. The σ54 activator-dependent initial events in open complex formation are mediated by structural changes between σ54 and the promoter DNA, which can be melted from position -12 to -5 in a reaction that can occur independently from RNAP core determinants. The restructuring of promoter DNA by activated σ54 has been termed σ54 isomerization (4Cannon W.V. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 386-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Following the initial events and requiring the presence of the RNAP core, the promoter DNA opening extends to position +3 relative to the transcription start site (7Cannon W. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Buck M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Energy coupling primarily involves intimate interactions between the activator and the σ54 promoter complex. σ54 activators, also termed enhancer-binding proteins (EBP), belong to the versatile AAA+ protein (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) family of molecular machines (for review see Refs. 8Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 9Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J.

Biol. 2006; 156: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Members of EBPs include the well studied NtrC, PspF, DctD, XylR, NifA, and DmpR proteins (11Studholme D.J. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). PspF is the phage shock protein F that activates transcription of psp genes involved in the phage shock response in Escherichia coli (12Jovanovic G. Lloyd L.J. Stumpf M.P. Mayhew A.J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21147-21161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The AAA+ domain (see Fig. 1 for AAA+ domain features) of the σ54 activator PspF (PspF1–275) is necessary and sufficient to activate transcription of the σ54-RNAP in vitro and in vivo (14Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The σ54 activator signature sequence GAFTGA loop 1 directly binds to the region I of σ54, which is involved in maintaining a closed σ54-RNAP promoter complex (16Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M.K. Ishihama A. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 681-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Stable interactions between PspF1–275 and σ54 form when PspF1–275 is bound to the nonhydrolyzable ATP transition state mimic ADP-AlFx (16Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This transition state complex was deemed a structural and functional intermediate complex that is “trapped” in a conformation en route to open complex formation (18Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Structures of PspF1–275 in complex with σ54 and PspF1–275 structures bound to different nucleotides, combined with biochemical properties of PspF1–275 variants, suggested a detailed molecular mechanism by which different nucleotide states would trigger motions of the GAFTGA motif within a PspF1–275 subunit (19Rappas M. Schumacher J. Beuron F. Niwa H. Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S. Keetch C.A. Robinson C.V. Buck M. Zhang X. Science. 2005; 307: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Rappas M. Schumacher J. Niwa H. Buck M. Zhang X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Signaling between Walker motif B and the GAFTGA loop 1 involves tight interactions between the PspF Walker B residue Glu108 and Asn64, nucleotide binding-dependent motions of linker regions 1 and 2, and a number of signaling residues that would position the GAFTGA loop 1 to contact σ54. Motions of the GAFTGA loop 1 appear synchronized with motions of the adjacent contacting loop 2. The AAA+ sequence insertion that structurally forms loop 2 in EBP classifies this family as member of the pre-sensor I β-hairpin insertion superclade of AAA+ proteins (Fig. 1) (21Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Loop 1 and loop 2 are positioned near the pore of the hexameric PspF1–275 assembly (19Rappas M. Schumacher J. Beuron F. Niwa H. Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S. Keetch C.A. Robinson C.V. Buck M. Zhang X. Science. 2005; 307: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). AAA+ proteins invariably contain the Walker A and Walker B motifs that structurally define them as P-loop ATPases. The second region of homology (overlapping with the previously described AAA minimum consensus sequence) or degenerate forms thereof is the major distinguishing primary sequence motif that distinguishes AAA+ proteins from other P-loop ATPases (22Lupas A.N. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The SRH contains the sensor I motif, often a threonine/asparagine pair, and an arginine residue known as the R-finger that functions as a trans-acting catalytic residue between adjacent subunits that form the catalytic site (8Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 9Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The R-finger provides a structural rationale for why oligomerization is required for efficient hydrolysis in AAA+ proteins. The first sensor residue of the SRH is predominantly a threonine, and the second one is often an asparagine, although threonines and methionines are also commonly found at this position. Well studied members of the AAA+ superfamily that share this motif include N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (TN), p97 (TN), RuvB (TT), ClpA (TT), FtsH (TN), and PspF (TN). It was suggested that the second residue of sensor I works in concert with the second acidic residue of the Walker B motif to coordinate a catalytic water molecule (23Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Currently, the role of the first residue of sensor I is not clear. We wished to identify specific roles for sensor I residues of PspF in the steps that are known to be required for open complex formation within the σ54-RNAP promoter complex. We tested activities of sensor I variants (PspF1–275T148A, PspF1–275N149A, and PspF1–275N149S) of the PspF AAA+ domain (PspF1–275) in vitro, including the following: ATP binding, nucleotide binding-dependent hexamer formation, nucleotide-dependent engagement with the σ54 promoter complex, ATP hydrolysis, open complex formation, and transcription activation. The sensor residue variants PspF1–275T148A and PspF1–275N149A show no apparent deficiencies in nucleotide binding or nucleotide-dependent hexamer formation. Albeit reduced ATP hydrolysis rates found for all sensor I variants, PspF1–275N149A and PspF1–275N149S, show only moderate deficiencies for activating transcription. The nucleotide binding and hydrolysis parameters of PspF1–275N149A and PspF1–275N149S suggest a direct catalytic role for Asn149. Despite similar ATP turnover rates of PspF1–275T148A and PspF1–275N149A, only PspF1–275T148A is severely affected in transcriptional activity. We show that defects of PspF1–275T148A are because of defects in productive coupling nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to a restructuring of the σ54 promoter complex and is not because of the failure to stably engage with the closed σ54 promoter complex, suggesting that Thr148 is critically important in the events of open complex formation subsequent to σ54 promoter engagement and independent of the presence of the RNAP core. The σ54 promoter binding by PspF1–275T148A distinguishes this variant from other PspF1–275 variants proposed to alter the position the GAFTGA loop (20Rappas M. Schumacher J. Niwa H. Buck M. Zhang X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This suggests that an additional important structural link between the nucleotide-binding site and the σ54 proximal contacting sites exists. Thr148 appears to enable hydrolysis-dependent changes of the second acidic Walker B residue (Glu108) to propagate to other SRH residues that could mediate movements to the PspF loop 2. In support of this communication route, activities of PspF1–275 variants that connect loop 2 with the adjacent GAFTGA loop are similar to those of PspF1–275T148A. We propose that Thr148 structurally couples hydrolysis-dependent motions to movements of loop 2 that are needed to restructure the σ54-RNAP closed complex via the loop 1 GAFTGA adaptor sequence. Mutagenesis and Protein Purifications—Plasmid pPB1 (14Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) encoding E. coli PspF residues 1–275 (PspF1–275 with an N-terminal His6 tag in pET28b+) was mutagenized (QuikChange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) to obtain the desired single amino acid substitutions in pspF, resulting in pPB1(T148A), pPB1(N149A), and pPB1(N149S). All PspF1–275 proteins were purified in the same manner and as described previously (24Schumacher J. Zhang X. Jones S. Bordes P. Buck M. J. Mol.

Briefly, E. coli B834 cells containing pPB1 plasmids were grown in 1 liter of LB (10 g of peptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl) until an A600 of ∼0.5 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25°C. After sonication and following nickel column purification, including a 70 mm imidazole wash, proteins were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol and stored at -20 °C. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200 10/300 (Amersham Biosciences) was carried out exactly as described previously (25Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, PspF1–275 proteins were introduced at high (63 μm) and low (10 μm) protein injection concentrations to assess concentration-dependent oligomer formation of apo-PspF1–275. In the presence of ATP or ADP, the column was pre-equilibrated with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 15 mm MgCl2) supplemented to give final ATP or ADP concentrations of 0.5 mm. Filtration was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated with globular proteins as follows: apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). All experiments were repeated at least twice. ATP Binding and Hydrolysis—ATP binding assays of PspF1–275 proteins by UV cross-linking and ATPase assays were essentially as described (24Schumacher J. Zhang X. Jones S. Bordes P. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-μl samples containing 3.4 μg of purified protein in reaction buffer A (35 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, 70 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 19 mm ammonium acetate, 0.7 mm dithiothreitol) contained 3 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) ± 1 mm ATP. Samples were illuminated (254 nm, UV lamp UVG; UVP Inc., CA) for 15 min on ice. PspF1–275 was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE after staining with Coomassie Blue, and the gels were scanned and then dried, and radioactivity was determined by phosphorimaging (Fuji Bas-1500 with Tina 2.10g software). The amount of protein per band was estimated by light transmission scanning. ATPase assays were in reaction buffer A (above) supplemented with MgCl2 to give final Mg2+ concentrations of 15 mm and incubated at 30 °C with different ATP concentrations containing 0.06 μCi/μl[α-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by adding 5 volumes of 2 m formic acid. Released 32Pi or [α-32P]ADP was separated from ATP by thin layer chromatography, and radiolabeled Pi, ADP, and ATP amounts were measured by phosphorimaging. Single Round in Vitro Transcription Assays—Standardized in vitro transcription assays were as in Ref. 26Wigneshweraraj S.R. Nechaev S. Bordes P. Jones S. Cannon W. Severinov K. Buck M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. Reactions contained 100 nm σ54-RNA polymerase, 5 μm PspF1–275 proteins, and 10 nm supercoiled Sinorhizobium meliloti nifH promoter DNA (26Wigneshweraraj S.R. Nechaev S. Bordes P. Jones S. Cannon W. Severinov K. Buck M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PspF1–275 Protein Binding to and Isomerization of the σ54 Promoter Complex—σ54 promoter complexes were performed for binding and isomerization assays with PspF1–275, essentially as described (4Cannon W.V. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bottom strand of the nifH promoter oligomer (-60 to +28 of the S. meliloti nifH promoter) was labeled with a fluorescent HEX tag, purchased from Operon AG and named WVC3-HEX. Duplex formation between the bottom strand and nonlabeled top strand occurred by mixing 5 μl of Hex-labeled NifH bottom strand (200 nm) and 5 μl of (400 nm) nonlabeled top strand in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm MgCl2. The mixture was then heated to 95 °C and allowed to anneal slowly while cooling over 2.5 h to minimize the formation of mismatch double-stranded DNA. For isomerization assays, the top strand carries a mismatch at positions -12/-11 that is thought to stabilize the melted σ54-DNA structure (4Cannon W.V. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Final concentrations in binding to and isomerization of the σ54 promoter complexes were 20 nm promoter DNA, 2.3 μm σ54, and 3 μm PspF1–275. Binding of PspF1–275 proteins to σ54 promoter DNA was assessed by in situ formation PspF1–275-ADP-Alx in the presence of 0.4 mm ADP, 5 mm NaF, 0.4 mm AlCl3 (16Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Isomerization assays were performed in the presence of 4 mm dGTP. Sensor I Residues Are Not Required for Nucleotide Binding or Nucleotide-dependent Hexamer Formation—The process of transcription activation depends on a number of distinct functionalities of the PspF AAA+ domain that are thought to occur in the following order: nucleotide binding, hexamer formation, contacting the σ54 promoter complex, ATP hydrolysis coupled to restructuring of the RNAP promoter, and disengagement from the open RNAP promoter complex. Disruption at any stage in this process should prevent subsequent events and result in the failure to activate transcription. It is therefore important to test PspF1–275 variants for each of those activities to attribute discrete functional roles in the multistep process of transcriptional activation. We substituted the sensor I TN residues to Ala as well as the Asn to the polar Ser and purified the respective proteins to obtain PspF1–275T148A, PspF1–275N149A, and PspF1–275N149S in the same manner as PspF1–275. All proteins were soluble. We applied UV cross-linking of PspF1–275 proteins to radiolabeled [32P]ATP to detect changes in nucleotide binding. PspF1–275 and other EBP appear to have a high off rate for ATP, in agreement with the high Kd values (34 μm) of PspF1–275 for ATPγS reported previously using isothermal calorimetry (25Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The nonequilibrium UV cross-linking method allowed us to identify significant changes in binding affinities for PspF1–275 Walker A and Walker B variants consistent with their established binding characteristics in other AAA+ proteins, including the EBP NtrC (24Schumacher J. Zhang X. Jones S. Bordes P. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Sarkar G. Edery I. Sonenberg N. J. Biol.

We found that none of the sensor I variants of PspF1–275 was severely affected in ATP binding (Fig. 2A). We next tested the PspF1–275 sensor I variants for their ability to form higher order oligomers in the absence and presence of nucleotide. PspF1–275 was shown to form higher order oligomers, probably hexamers, in a strictly concentration-dependent fashion that correlates with ATPase activity (25Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Defects in oligomer formation are therefore predicted to negatively affect hydrolysis because of loss of cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis between subunits. It is established that ATP and ADP binding induces structural changes within PspF1–275 (20Rappas M. Schumacher J. Niwa H. Buck M. Zhang X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and strongly promotes hexamer formation of PspF1–275, indicating nucleotide binding induces structural changes to increase self-association (25Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test if PspF1–275 sensor I variants are defective in higher oligomer formation in their apo-, ADP-, and ATP-bound forms, we carried out gel filtration chromatography experiments in the presence and absence of nucleotides. When ADP or ATP was present, we chose the lowest protein concentrations that could still be detected with satisfactory confidence to maximize the sensitivity for detecting possible defects in higher oligomer formation. Chromatographs of PspF1–275T148A, PspF1–275N149A, and PspF1–275N149S (Fig. 2B and data not shown) showed no apparent defects in hexamerization in the absence of nucleotide and at high protein concentrations (64 μm), nor in the presence of ATP or ADP at low protein concentrations (10 μm). Apparent hexamer formation of PspF1–275T148A, PspF1–275N149A, and PspF1–275N149S in the presence of 0.5 mm ADP or ATP during gel filtration indicates that these variants have no ADP or ATP binding-dependent oligomer formation defects. Apparent apo-PspF1–275 hexamers elute around 11.7 ml and apparent nucleotide-bound PspF1–275 hexamers at around 11.2 ml. Apparent dimers elute at around 15 ml. Structural and functional data argue that the difference in elution volumes between higher order oligomeric apo- and nucleotide-bound forms of PspF1–275 are because of nucleotide-induced conformational changes in the hexamer rather than to a different subunit composition (25Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We conclude that substitutions of sensor I residues do not result in conformational changes at the subunit interface and that ADP or ATP binding-dependent conformational changes occur that are compatible with hexamer formation. Sensor I Residues Are Required for High ATP Hydrolysis Rates—We determined the kinetic ATP hydrolysis parameters of mutant proteins at 30 °C (Table 1). Sensor I variants showed 6–15-fold decrease in ATP hydrolysis rates, and PspF1–275N149A and PspF1–275N149S have a significantly reduced Km value. A reduced Km value usually indicates an increase in nucleotide affinity and/or structural changes in the catalytic site that alter product formation rates. A 4-fold excess of ADP over ATP at saturating nucleotide concentrations (1 mm ATP and 4 mm ADP) inhibits PspF1–275 turnover in ADP binding competition experiments that fully agree with the reported binding constants of PspF1–275 for ATPγS (34 μm) and ADP (118 μm) (24Schumacher J. Zhang X. Jones S. Bordes P. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We found the same nucleotide ratio-dependent inhibition on ATP turnover for PspF1–275N149A as for PspF1–275, indicating the reduced ATPase activity of the Asn149 to Ala substitution variant is not because of decreased ADP release kinetics (data not shown). We conclude that the side chain of Asn149 is involved in catalysis per se. This interpretation is further supported by the steady-state parameters kcat and Km of the polar substitution of Asn149 to S in PspF1–275N149S (Table 1).TABLE 1ATP hydrolysis parameters of PspF1-275, PspF1-275T148A, PspF1-275T148S, and PspF1-275N149A kcat values were determined at 3 μm PspF1-275, 1 mm ATP at 30°C. Km values are derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots between ATP concentrations from 0.01 to 2 mm.ProteinkcatKmPspF1-27538.9 ± 2455 ± 23PspF1-275T148A3.2 ± 0.3484 ± 24PspF1-275N149A2.5 ± 0.3179 ± 9PspF1-275N149S6.1 ± 0.4224 ± 11 Open table in a new tab Previous studies have shown that subsaturation of ADP concentrations (100 μm) stimulate the ATPase activity of PspF1–275, whereas above saturation concentrations of ATP (>4 mm) inhibit turnover, showing that ADP-bound PspF1–275 has a positive cooperative effect on hydrolysis within a heterogeneously occupied hexamer, whereas ATP bound PspF1–275 can act as a negative allosteric effector (25Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Changes in ADP- or ATP-mediated allosteric effects under conditions where PspF1–275T148A and PspF1–275N149A form hexamers (above) could indicate a role in intersubunit signaling, which is dependent on the bound type of nucleotide. For PspF1–275T148A and PspF1–275N149A, ATPase activity was stimulated in the presence of subsaturation ADP concentrations and inhibited at >4 mm concentrations of ATP (data not shown). Therefore, no obvious role for sensor I residues in cooperative hydrolysis is evident. Low ATP Turnover Rates of PspF1–275N149A Are Not Detrimental for Activating Transcription—ATP hydrolysis by PspF1–275 is needed to restructure the stable σ54-RNAP promoter closed complex to an open thermodynamically unfavorable conformation (4Cannon W.V. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We determined whether the reduced turnover rates of PspF1–275T148A and PspF1–275N149A could still activate transcription in vitro, in single round transcription assays from the S. meliloti supercoiled nifH promoter (Fig. 3). PspF1–275T148A and PspF1–275N149A show defects in transcription activation, although PspF1–275N149A only moderately (42 ± 4% activity compared with PspF1–275) compared with PspF1–275T148A (10 ± 2%). These findings cannot be readily explained by differences in hydrolys"

A fundamental question that remains obscure is how protein domains that are in direct contact with the membrane lipids move during the conformational change of the membrane protein. Important structural and functional information of several lipid-exposed transmembrane domains of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and other ion channel membrane proteins have been provided by the tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis. Here, we use the tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis to monitor the conformational change of the αM3 domain of the muscle-type AChR. The perturbation produced by the systematic tryptophan substitution along the αM3 domain were characterized through two-electrode voltage clamp and 125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin binding. The periodicity profiles of the changes in AChR expression (closed state) and ACh EC50 (open-channel state) disclose two different helical structures; a thinner-elongated helix for the closed state and a thicker-shrunken helix for the open-channel state. The existence of two different helical structures suggest that the conformational transition of the αM3 domain between both states resembles a spring motion and reveals that the lipid-AChR interface plays a key role in the propagation of the conformational wave evoked by agonist binding.

Defects in the AChR function could affect the transmission of nerve signals across synapses and cause pathological diseases such as the congenital myasthenic syndromes (5Engel A.G. Ohno K. Sine S.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 26: 347-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The AChR is composed of five homologous membrane-spanning subunits, 2α1β1δϵ, assembled quasi-pentamerically around a central axis, forming a cation-selective ion channel (6Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). Each subunit contains a large hydrophilic extracellular N terminus, 4 putative transmembrane domains of 19-25 amino acids denoted as M1-M4, a large cytoplasmic loop between the M3 and M4 domains, and a short extracellular C terminus (7Devillers-Thiery A.

Nature. 2005; 438: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, a previous study found significant structural differences in the membrane domains of the AChR channel lumen among resting, open, and desensitized states (11Wilson G. Karlin A. Proc. Natl.

A great deal of information about the conformational changes of the ion pore-forming domains of the AChR has been obtained from single channel kinetics, which have been mainly obtained from studies in the muscle-type AChR (15Wang H.L.

Along this line, the structural and functional differences in the transmembrane domains between the Torpedo and muscle-type AChRs remain to be established.

A list of photolabeling affinity studies has clearly demonstrated that there is a large change in the degree of lipid contact of the lipid-exposed transmembrane domains between the resting and agonist-induced desensitized states, therefore suggesting that these domains display a substantial conformational change upon agonist-induced activation of the AChR (10Blanton M.P.

The present TrpScanM approach allowed us to construct structural models of the muscle-type AChR αM3 domain in both the closed- and open-channel states and to compare between Torpedo and muscle-type AChRs. The interpretation of these structural models led us to postulate a spring model. The spring model proposes that channel gating could be linked to the helical structure stability of the lipid-exposed transmembrane domains in the open-channel state. Further examination of the spring model in other ion channels will open new avenues that could potentially increase our understanding on how lipid-exposed domains regulate ion channel function in general. Finally, the comparison of the Trp-ScanM data between the αM3 domain of the muscle-type and Torpedo AChRs also reveals localized conformational differences that could contribute to the functional differences between these receptors. General Experimental Procedures—Xenopus laevis oocytes were microinjected with the mouse muscle adult-type AChR complementary RNAs (see also Refs. 25Tamamizu S. Guzman G.R. Santiago J. Rojas L.V.

Mutations were engineered with the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. All mutagenic primers were designed with the tryptophan codon (TGG) instead of the wild type (WT) codon at the desired position. Muscle-type AChR cRNA transcripts were synthesized with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE® kit (Ambion). Oocytes were incubated for 3-5 days with fresh liquid medium at 19 °C. Voltage Clamp—Macroscopic ACh-induced currents were recorded with a whole-cell two-electrode voltage clamp configuration using the Gene Clamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments) at room temperature. Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl, resistances were <2 megaohms. Impaled oocytes were automatically perfused with MOR-2 buffer (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4)) at a rate of 0.43 ml/s using a Perfusion Valve Controller VC-8 (Warner Instruments). Membrane potential was held at -70 mV. Membrane currents were filtered at 100 Hz and digitized at 1 kHz using a DigiData 1322A interface (Axon Instruments). Data acquisition was conducted through the Clampex 9.2 program (Axon Instruments). Dose-response curves were generated from macroscopic peak currents (I) obtained from 7 different ACh concentrations (1, 3, 10, 30, 55, 100, and 300 μm ACh). Dose-response curves were fitted through the sigmoidal dose-response equation with variable slope using the GraphPad Prism 4 program (GraphPad),I(nA)=Imin+Imax-Imin1+10(logEC50-log[ACh])×Hillslope(Eq.1) where I is the macroscopic peak ionic current at a given ACh concentration, Imin and Imax are the smallest and the largest currents observed, respectively, EC50 is the concentration of acetylcholine that provokes a response halfway between Imin and Imax, and the Hill slope is the steepness of the dose-response curve. 125I-Labeled α-Bungarotoxin Binding Assays—125I-Labeled α-bungarotoxin (125I-labeled α-BgTx) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) binding assays were performed immediately after the voltage clamp measurement for the same intact oocytes. Oocytes were incubated in 20 nm 125I-labeled α-BgTx, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, MOR-2 without EGTA, and in the absence of agonist at room temperature for 2 h. Non-injected oocytes were incubated under the same conditions to measure nonspecific binding. The excess of toxin was removed by washing each oocyte with 25 ml of MOR-2 without EGTA. Calibration curves were plotted with radioactivity (counts/min) as a function of concentration 125I-labeled α-BgTx (fmol). Calibration curves were used to determine the AChR expression levels in each oocyte. Radioactivity was measured using a Beckman 5500 γ counter (Beckman Coulter). Normalized Macroscopic AChR Response—The normalized response (nA/fmol) of each oocyte was assessed as the ratio of the macroscopic peak current (nA) generated at 300 μm ACh to the superficial 125I-labeled α-BgTx binding (fmol). Statistical Analysis—Each αM3-mutant was compared against the WT for each parameter using a one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post-test performed in the GraphPad Prism 4 program (see Table 1). The mean of the number of residues per turn of the closed- and open-channel states was compared using an unpaired t test with Welch's correction through the GraphPad Prism 4 program.TABLE 1Biophysical parameters of the wild type and αM3-mutant AChRsAChR typeExpression levelEC50Hill coefficientImaxNormalized responseaThe normalized response (nA/fmol) of each oocyte was assessed as the ratio of the macroscopic peak current (nA) generated at 300 μm ACh to the superficial 125I-labeled α-BgTx binding (fmol).fmolμm−nA−nA/fmol2α1β1δϵ (wild type)0.33 ± 0.0246 ± 21.5 ± 0.52402 ± 2885649 ± 6252α1(L279W)β1δϵ0.5 ± 0.13 ± 1c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.1.4 ± 0.6855 ± 53c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.3374 ± 367c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.2α1(F280W)β1δϵ0.12 ± 0.0350 ± 2b0.01 ≤ p < 0.05.1.3 ± 0.3743 ± 82c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.8514 ± 1526c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.2α1(T281W)β1δϵ0.4 ± 0.1NDNDNDND2α1(M282W)β1δϵ0.24 ± 0.02NDNDNDND2α1(V283W)β1δϵ0.26 ± 0.0616 ± 1c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.1.3 ± 0.261 ± 3c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.406 ± 36c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.2α1(F284W)β1δϵ0.20 ± 0.0110 ± 1c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.1.0 ± 0.62923 ± 276c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.10046 ± 536c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.2α1(V285W)β1δϵ0.13 ± 0.02NDNDNDND2α1(I286W)β1δϵ1.1 ± 0.2c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.41 ± 1c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.2.7 ± 0.5c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.9190 ± 427c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.10084 ± 735c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.2α1(A287W)β1δϵ0.30 ± 0.0337 ± 1c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.1.4 ± 0.64005 ± 345c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.9178 ± 490c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.2α1(S288W)β1δϵ0.1 ± 0.2NDNDNDND2α1(I289W)β1δϵ0.66 ± 0.09c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.4 ± 1c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.0.9 ± 0.2310 ± 21c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.538 ± 36c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.2α1(I290W)β1δϵ0.34 ± 0.0116 ± 1c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.1.4 ± 0.66692 ± 174c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.13418 ± 276c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.2α1(I291W)β1δϵ1.28 ± 0.09c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.22 ± 1c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.1.2 ± 0.16093 ± 195c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.4847 ± 189b0.01 ≤ p < 0.05.2α1(T292W)β1δϵ0.08 ± 0.03NDNDNDND2α1(V293W)β1δϵ0.05 ± 0.04b0.01 ≤ p < 0.05.NDNDNDND2α1(I294W)β1δϵ0.07 ± 0.04b0.01 ≤ p < 0.05.42 ± 1b0.01 ≤ p < 0.05.2 ± 1558 ± 68c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.4444 ± 735c0.001 ≤ p < 0.01.2α1(V295W)β1δϵ0.21 ± 0.05NDNDNDND2α1(I296W)β1δϵ0.29 ± 0.04NDNDNDNDa The normalized response (nA/fmol) of each oocyte was assessed as the ratio of the macroscopic peak current (nA) generated at 300 μm ACh to the superficial 125I-labeled α-BgTx binding (fmol).b 0.01 ≤ p < 0.05.c 0.001 ≤ p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Periodicity Profiles—The number of residues per helical turn for the closed- and open-channel states was determined by the AChR expression and ACh EC50 periodicity profiles, respectively (see Fig. 2, A-D). The AChR expression of each mutant was standardized to the change in amino acid volume (Å3) caused by each tryptophan substitution (fmol/Å3). Standardized expression (Xstandardized) was calculated as,Xstandardized(fmol/Å3)=XmutantVTrp-VWT(Eq.2) where Xmutant is the expression of the αM3 mutant AChRs, and VTrp and VWT are the volumes of the tryptophan and original residues, respectively. Amino acid volume values (VTrp and VWT) are from crystallographic studies (60Chothia C. Nature. 1975; 254: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Periodicity profiles were plotted with ACh EC50 or AChR expression as function of their tryptophan substitution position along the αM3 domain. Periodicity curves were created through the cubic spline method with 3000 segments using the GraphPad Prism 4 program. The number of residues per helical turn of the periodicity profiles was estimated as the number of amino acids between the adjacent maximums and minimums peaks. Helical Net Diagrams—Helical net diagrams were built using the number of residues between the adjacent maximum and minimum peaks of the periodicity profile for the open-channel state (see Fig. 2D). Rotation angle (Ω) per residue for each helical turn was calculated as,Ω(degree)=360°n(Eq.3) where n is the number of residues per helical turn. Helical rise per residue (d) for each helical turn was determined using,d(Å)=pn×Δ+b(Eq.4) where Δ is the number of amino acids between the positions of the residue and anterior peak, b is the magnitude of the maximum rise in the anterior helical turn (thus, the rise at 360°), and the helical pitch (p) per helical turn was estimated through p (Å) =-1 × n + 9 (n is the number of residues per helical turn). Molecular Modeling—The structural models of the closed- and open-channel states were built with the periodicity profile data using the Deep Viewer/Swiss-PdbViewer 3.7 program (Swiss-Pdb Viewer). The backbone of each helical structure was adjusted to the number of residues per helical turn determined by periodicity profiles using,3cosΩ=1-4cos2(ϕ+ψ2)(Eq.5) where Ω is rotation angle per residue, and φ and ψ are backbone dihedral angles. The helical structures were energetically minimized. The backbones of the helical structures were superimposed to compare their structure. The quality of the superimposition between two helical structures was evaluated by calculating the root mean squared deviation. The mobility of the backbone atoms between helical structures was displayed using B-factor in the superposed models. The length (h), helical pitch (p), and helical rise per amino acid (d) of the helical structure were calculated through the Deep Viewer/Swiss-Pdb-Viewer 3.7 program. The radio (r) of the helical structure was estimated using r2 = (p/2)2 + d2, considering the helical structure as a cylinder. The volume (V) of the helical structure was assessed using V = πr2h. Molecular graphics generated in the Swiss-PdbViewer program were exported to the PyMOL™ Molecular Graphics System program (DeLano Scientific LLC) (see Fig. 3) to produce images of the highest quality. Functional Characterization of the αM3 Mutations—All the αM3 mutants showed different AChR expression levels (Table 1). Two of the αM3 mutations (V293W and I294W) displayed a significant reduction in the AChR expression levels compared with WT. Although the other four mutations displayed an apparent reduction in AChR expression levels (i.e. F280W, V285W, S288W, and T292W), a detailed statistical analysis shown in Table 1 suggests that the expression of these mutants is not significantly different from WT. The other three mutations (I286W, I289W, and I291W) showed 200-400% higher AChR expression levels compared with WT, suggesting a facilitation of oligomerization and/or assembly induced by these mutations. The remaining nine mutations (L279W, T281W, M282W, V283W, F284W, A287W, I290W, V295W, and I296W) exhibited similar AChR expression levels as WT. These expression results have demonstrated that a bulky side chain can be accommodated along the αM3 transmembrane domain of the muscle-type AChR, although eight mutations (T281W, M282W, V285W, S288W, T292W, V293W, V295W, and I296W) were incapable of eliciting ACh-induced currents (Fig. 1B and Table 1). This loss of ion channel function in the aforementioned mutations could be a consequence of the steric hindrance introduced by the bulky tryptophan side chain. All the mutations that produced functional AChRs showed a typical sigmoidal ACh dose-response curve except I286W and I289W, which exhibited steeper and shallower curve profiles, respectively (Fig. 1C). The dose-response behavior of I286W and I289W suggests a notable change in the allosteric properties of the AChR. Four mutations (I286W, A287W, I290W, and I291W) enhanced the maximum macroscopic response by 150-400% compared with WT (Table 1). The remaining six mutations (L279W, F280W, V283W, F284W, I289W, and I294W) significantly reduced the maximum macroscopic response, except F284W, which displayed a response similar to WT. Although the normalized macroscopic response was increased by five mutations (F280W, F284W, I286W, A287W, and I290W), it was drastically decreased by V283W and I289W (Table 1). The remaining three mutations (L279W, I291W, and I294W) displayed a normalized macroscopic response analogous to WT. The potency to acetylcholine (as measured by EC50) was enhanced by 6 mutations (L279W, V283W, F284W, I289W, I290W, and I291W) from 200 to 1500% compared with WT (Fig. 1C). The reduction in EC50 values could be due to changes in affinity and/or efficacy of acetylcholine. On the other hand, 4 other mutations (F280W, I286W, A287W, and I294W) exhibited similar potency as WT. The present data suggest that tryptophan substitutions at positions αLeu-279, αVal-283, and αIle-289 produce a negative allosteric modulation given that these three mutations exhibit a decrease in macroscopic currents response while displaying increased AChR expression levels and ACh potencies (Table 1). In contrast, mutations F284W, I287W, I290W, and I291W displayed a gain-of-function response; their EC"
https://openalex.org/W1979599706,"Protein kinase A anchoring proteins or AKAPs regulate the activity of many ion channels. Protein kinase A (PKA) is a well-recognized target of AKAPs, with other kinases now emerging as additional targets. We examined the roles of epithelial-expressed AKAPs in regulating the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Experiments used heterologous expression with AKAP15, AKAP-KL, and AKAP79 in Xenopus oocytes. Experiments were carried out under high and low Na+ conditions, as Na+ loading is known to affect the baseline activity of ENaC in a PKC-dependent mechanism. ENaC activity was unaffected by AKAP79 and AKAP-KL expression. However, oocytes coexpressing AKAP15 exhibited an 80% and 91% reduction in the amiloride-sensitive, whole-cell conductance in high and low Na+ conditions, respectively. The reduced channel activity was unaffected by PKA activation or inhibition, indicating a PKA-independent mechanism. Expression with a membrane-targeting domain, mutant form of AKAP15 (AKAP15m) prevented the decrease of ENaC activity, but only under low Na+ conditions. In high sodium conditions, coexpression with AKAP15m led to an increase of ENaC activity to levels similar to those observed under low Na+. These results indicate that membrane-associated AKAP15 reduces ENaC activity whereas the cytoplasmically associated one may participate in the channel's feedback inhibition by intracellular Na+, a process known to involve PKC. This hypothesis was further confirmed in coexpression experiments, which demonstrated functional and physical interaction between AKAP15 and PKCalpha. We propose that AKAP15 regulates ENaC via a novel PKA-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2080913913,"The vertebrate nuclear pore protein Nup153 contains a novel RNA binding domain. This 150-amino acid region was previously found to bind preferentially to a panel of mRNAs when compared with structured RNAs, such as tRNA, U snRNA, and double-stranded RNA. The ability to broadly recognize mRNA led to the conclusion that the Nup153 RNA binding domain confers a general affinity for single-stranded RNA. Here, we have probed Nup153 RNA recognition to decipher how this unique RNA binding domain discriminates between potential targets. We first mapped the binding determinant within an RNA fragment that associates relatively robustly with the Nup153 RNA binding domain. We next designed synthetic RNA oligonucleotides to systematically delineate the features within this minimal RNA fragment that are key to Nup153 RNA-binding domain binding and demonstrated that the binding preferences of Nup153 do not reflect general preferences of an mRNA/single-stranded RNA-binding protein. We further found that the association between Nup153 and a cellular mRNA can be attributed to an interaction with specific subregions of the RNA. These results indicate that Nup153 can discriminate between mRNA and other classes of RNA transcripts due in part to direct recognition of a loose sequence motif. This information adds a new dimension to the interfaces that can contribute to recognition in mRNA export cargo selection and fate."
