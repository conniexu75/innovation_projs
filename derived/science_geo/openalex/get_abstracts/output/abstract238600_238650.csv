Moreover, we found another amidohydrolase catalyzing the same reaction only at acidic pH, and we purified it from rat lung (Ueda, N., Yamanaka, K., and Yamamoto, S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35552–35557). Here we report complementary DNA cloning and functional expression of the enzyme termed “N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA)” from human, rat, and mouse. The deduced primary structures revealed that NAAA had no homology to fatty acid amide hydrolase but belonged to the choloylglycine hydrolase family. Human NAAA was essentially identical to a gene product that had been noted to resemble acid ceramidase but lacked ceramide hydrolyzing activity. The recombinant human NAAA overexpressed in HEK293 cells hydrolyzed various N-acylethanolamines with N-palmitoylethanolamine as the most reactive substrate. Most interestingly, a very low ceramide hydrolyzing activity was also detected with NAAA, and N-lauroylethanolamine hydrolyzing activity was observed with acid ceramidase. By the use of tunicamycin and endoglycosidase, NAAA was found to be a glycoprotein. Furthermore, the enzyme was proteolytically processed to a shorter form at pH 4.5 but not at pH 7.4. Expression analysis of a green fluorescent protein-NAAA fusion protein showed a lysosome-like distribution in HEK293 cells. The organ distribution of the messenger RNA in rats revealed its wide distribution with the highest expression in lung. These results demonstrated that NAAA is a novel N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing enzyme that shows structural and functional similarity to acid ceramidase.

Earlier, saturated and monounsaturated NAEs including N-palmitoylethanolamine, N-stearoylethanolamine, and N-oleoylethanolamine were found as major NAEs in mammalian tissues (5Bachur N.R. Masek K.

Later, polyunsaturated NAEs represented by N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide) were identified as endogenous ligands of cannabinoid receptor CB1 (7Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Saturated and monounsaturated NAEs are inactive as ligands of cannabinoid receptors but have been reported to reveal various biological activities (1Schmid H.H.O. Schmid P.C. Natarajan V. Prog.

Recently, it was shown that the anti-inflammatory action of N-palmitoylethanolamine could be mediated by the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) (21Lo Verme J. Fu J. Astarita G. La Rana G. Russo R. Calignano A. Piomelli D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Furthermore, N-oleoylethanolamine was shown to be anorexic via PPAR-α (22Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gomez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodriguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1580-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, NAEs have been noted to increase markedly in degenerating tissues and cells (6Epps D.E. Schmid P.C. Natarajan V. Schmid H.H.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Perry S.R. Dettmer T.M. Maasson J.L. Schmid H.H.O.

Biophys. 1998; 354: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We recently cloned cDNA of a novel phospholipase D that specifically releases NAEs from their corresponding N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (29Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), further supporting the physiological significance of NAEs. Anandamide and other NAEs are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids and ethanolamine, and this intracellular degradation is mostly attributed to the catalysis by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) (30Ueda N. Puffenbarger R.A. Yamamoto S. Deutsch D.G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 31Ueda N.

This membrane-bound enzyme is widely distributed in mammalian organs and is characterized by an optimal pH value at 8.5–10 and high sensitivity to serine hydrolase inhibitors, including phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate. Among the various NAEs hydrolyzed by FAAH, anandamide is the most reactive substrate, and N-palmitoylethanolamine is less reactive. Recent progress in the studies on FAAH, including cDNA cloning (34Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar) and crystallography (35Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), revealed that FAAH belongs to the amidase signature family and possesses a catalytic triad of Ser-Ser-Lys. In addition, analysis of FAAH-deficient mice showed the central role of this enzyme in the degradation of anandamide and other NAEs in the brain (36Cravatt B.F. Demarest K. Patricelli M.P. Bracey M.H. Giang D.K. Martin B.R. Lichtman A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9371-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 37Lichtman A.H. Hawkins E.G. Griffin G. Cravatt B.F.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3916-3923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to FAAH, we found another NAE-hydrolyzing amidohydrolase, which was active only at acidic pH, first in human megakaryoblastic (CMK) cells (39Ueda N. Yamanaka K. Terasawa Y. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and later in various rat tissues including lung, spleen, and macrophages (40Ueda N. Yamanaka K. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35552-35557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This enzyme, termed as N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA) in the present article, was distinguishable from FAAH by its optimal pH around 5, the preference of N-palmitoylethanolamine to other NAEs, activation by Triton X-100 (a non-ionic detergent) and dithiothreitol (DTT), and lower sensitivity to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (39Ueda N. Yamanaka K. Terasawa Y. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 40Ueda N. Yamanaka K. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35552-35557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We recently found that some ester and amide compounds such as N-cyclohexanecarbonylpentadecylamine are selective inhibitors of NAAA without inhibitory effects on FAAH (41Vandevoorde S. Tsuboi K. Ueda N. Jonsson K.O. Fowler C.J. Lambert D.M. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4373-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42Tsuboi K. Hilligsmann C. Vandevoorde S. Lambert D.M. Ueda N. Biochem. J. 2003; 379: 99-106Crossref Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested that NAAA was an enzyme protein different from FAAH. The molecular characterization of NAAA was indispensable to the elucidation of its physiological role. Although we purified NAAA from rat lung to apparent homogeneity (40Ueda N. Yamanaka K. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35552-35557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), cDNA cloning of NAAA has not been performed to date. Here we report for the first time the identification of cDNA encoding NAAA. The functional expression of the cDNA confirmed NAAA to be a second NAE-hydrolyzing enzyme. Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence unveiled similarity of NAAA to acid ceramidase (AC), an amidohydrolase-hydrolyzing ceramide to sphingosine and fatty acid, which urged us to compare catalytic properties of NAAA with those of AC. We also investigated possible glycosylation and proteolytic modification of NAAA and its intracellular localization. Our results may contribute to the further understanding of the catabolism of NAEs and ceramides in the context of lipid metabolism.

CMK cells were kindly provided by Dr. Eiji Shimizu of the Third Department of Internal Medicine, Tottori University School of Medicine, with the consent of Dr. Takeyuki Sato of Chiba University. Various N-[1-14C]acylethanolamines were chemically prepared from ethanolamine and their corresponding 1-14C-labeled fatty acids (43Ueda N. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto S. Tokunaga T. Shirakawa E. Shinkai H. Ogawa M. Sato T. Kudo I. Inoue K. Takizawa H. Nagano T. Hirobe M. Matsuki N. Saito H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). N-[1-14C]Acylsphingosines (ceramides) were also chemically prepared from sphingosine and their corresponding 1-14C-labeled fatty acids (40Ueda N. Yamanaka K. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35552-35557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). [1-14C]Oleamide was chemically prepared from [14C]-oleic acid and ammonium water (44Cravatt B.F. Prospero-Garcia O. Siuzdak G. Gilula N.B. Henriksen S.J. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Science. 1995; 268: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). N-Cyclohexanecarbonylpentadecylamine was synthesized as described previously (42Tsuboi K. Hilligsmann C. Vandevoorde S. Lambert D.M. Ueda N. Biochem. J. 2003; 379: 99-106Crossref Google Scholar). Enzyme Purification and Protein Sequencing—The purification of NAAA enzyme from rat lung was performed as described previously (40Ueda N. Yamanaka K. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35552-35557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, NAAA was solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 by freezing and thawing from the 12,000 × g pellet of the lung homogenates of 90 adult Wistar rats (250–500-g body weight, Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Japan). After centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 50 min, the supernatant was subjected to acid treatment at pH 4. Resultant insoluble proteins were removed by the centrifugation at 260,000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B. NAAA was then eluted with 1% octyl glucoside and loaded on a HiTrap heparin column. The flow-through fractions were collected and applied onto a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Gel HTP). NAAA was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm sodium phosphate. The sample was finally loaded onto a HiTrap butyl FF equilibrated with 2 m ammonium sulfate, and NAAA was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% octyl glucoside. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The purified rat lung NAAA was concentrated by a centrifugal filter device (Microcon YM-10), subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel, and electrotransferred to a hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, the band was excised, and its N-terminal sequence was determined with a Procise model 492 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). cDNA Cloning—The data base search using the BLAST analysis program revealed that the determined N-terminal sequence of the purified rat NAAA was contained in a rat putative cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number XM_223237.2) and a mouse cDNA sequence (AK008776.1). We also found that a reported human amino acid sequence termed “acid ceramidase-like protein” (GenBank™ accession number Q02083) (46Hong S.B. Li C.M. Rhee H.J. Park J.H. He X. Levy B. Yoo O.J. Schuchman E.H. Genomics. 1999; 62: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was highly homologous to the rat and mouse sequences. We assumed these three sequences were as NAAA of rat, mouse, and human (see “Results”). The cDNAs containing the putative full-length coding region of NAAA and AC were generated by PCR. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent from human CMK cells cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS (PAA Laboratories) and 0.1 μm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate for 4 days or from the lungs of rat (Wistar, Charles River Japan) or mouse (C57BL/6, Japan SLC). cDNAs were then prepared with the aid of oligo(dT) primer and Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads. For cDNA cloning of human NAAA, we prepared two cDNA fragments according to the cDNA sequence of acid ceramidase-like protein (46Hong S.B. Li C.M. Rhee H.J. Park J.H. He X. Levy B. Yoo O.J. Schuchman E.H. Genomics. 1999; 62: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One cDNA fragment was amplified by LA Taq polymerase with the sense primer 5′-GCGGAAGCTTGAGCCCGAGCCATGCGGAC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CATCAGCAATAAGGGGAGTCTTGGCCAACT-3′, and its digestion with HindIII and ApoI gave a 0.44-kb fragment containing nucleotides 27–463 (the numbers from Ref. 46Hong S.B. Li C.M. Rhee H.J. Park J.H. He X. Levy B. Yoo O.J. Schuchman E.H. Genomics. 1999; 62: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The other cDNA fragment was amplified by Pyrobest DNA polymerase with the sense primer 5′-AAGACTCCAGAGGCCACATTTACCATGGTC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TTCTCTCGAGTTACTTTCTACTCGGGTTTC-3′, and its digestion with ApoI and XhoI gave a 0.65-kb fragment containing nucleotides 464–1118. The HindIII-ApoI fragment was first inserted between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of a eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA 3.1(+), and the ApoI-XhoI fragment was then added between the EcoRI and XhoI sites to generate pcDNA 3.1(+) harboring the putative full-length coding region of human NAAA cDNA. For cDNA cloning of rat and mouse NAAA, we first amplified cDNA fragments containing the entire open reading frame by Pyrobest DNA polymerase with the sense primer 5′-CTGGTACCGCTCATTGGTCAGGTAGTGACC-3′ (rat) or 5′-CAGGTACCATTCATTGGTCCGGTGGTGGCC-3′ (mouse), and the antisense primer 5′-TCGAATTCTTAGTCTTCCAAATGCAGCTC-3′ (rat) or 5′-AGGAATTCCAGTCTTAGACTTCTAAATGCAG-3′ (mouse). These primers were designed on the basis of the above-mentioned cDNA sequences (GenBank™ accession numbers XM_223237.2 and AK008776.1) and the adjacent genomic sequence of rat (NW_047423.1). After the amplified cDNA fragments were digested with KpnI and EcoRI and inserted into pBluescript SK(+), we performed the second PCR by Pyrobest DNA polymerase with these cDNA clones and internal primers (the sense primer, 5′-GTGGTACCAGCAGCCCGAGCCATGGGGAC-3′ for rat or 5′-GTGGTACCAGAAGCCGGAGCTATGGGGAC-3′ for mouse; the antisense primer, 5′-AAGAATTCTCAGCTTGGGTTTCTGATC-3′ for rat or 5′-CAGAATTCTCAGCTCGGGTTTCTGATC-3′ for mouse). The amplified cDNA fragments were digested with KpnI and EcoRI and inserted into pcDNA 3.1(+). For construction of cDNA for hexahistidine-tagged NAAA, a human NAAA cDNA lacking stop codon was generated by PCR using the sense primer 5′-GCGGAAGCTTGAGCCCGAGCCATGCGGAC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TCCTCGAGGATCCTTTCTACTCGGGTTTCT-3′. This cDNA fragment was digested with HindIII and XhoI and inserted into pcDNA 3.1/myc-His C to generate a C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged NAAA protein. For human AC, the full-length coding region was amplified by Pyrobest DNA polymerase with the sense primer 5′-GCGGTACCAGGCTAGAGCGATGCCGGGCC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GACGGATCCTCACCAACCTATACAAGGGTC-3′. These primers were designed according to the reported nucleotide sequence of human AC (GenBank™ accession number U70063) (47Koch J. Gärtner S. Li C.M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O. Schnabel D. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33110-33115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The amplified 1.2-kb fragment was digested with KpnI and BamHI and inserted into pcDNA 3.1(+). The inserted cDNAs for human, rat, and mouse NAAA, the C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged NAAA, and human AC were sequenced in both directions with the aid of ABI 310 and 377 DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems). Overexpression of Recombinant Enzymes—HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C to 70% confluency in a poly-l-lysine-coated 100-mm dish containing DMEM with 10% FCS (Invitrogen) and 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. Transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions; 8 μgofthe expression vector pcDNA 3.1(+) harboring cDNA of NAAA or AC was mixed with 72 μl of Lipofectamine in 1.6 ml of serum-free DMEM for 30 min and then added to the cells with 6.4 ml of serum-free DMEM. After incubation for 5 h, the medium was removed, and the transfected cells were further cultured in the presence of FCS for 43 h with one change of medium at 19 h. For tunicamycin treatment, the culture medium containing 5 μg/ml tunicamycin or vehicle (0.05% Me2SO) was used after the change of medium at 19 h. The cells were harvested with the aid of trypsin, washed twice, suspended in 800 μl of PBS, and sonicated three times each for 3 s. The resultant cell lysate was used as the enzyme preparation. Control HEK293 cells were prepared by the same method, except that the insert-free pcDNA 3.1(+) vector was used for transfection. Enzyme Assay—For the assay of NAE hydrolyzing activity, the enzyme was incubated with 200 μm N-[14C]acylethanolamine (1000 cpm/nmol, dissolved in 10 μl of Me2SO) at 37 °C for 30 min in 100 μl of 100 mm citrate-sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 3 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% BSA, and 150 mm NaCl, unless otherwise noted. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.32 ml of a mixture of diethyl ether, methanol, 1 m citric acid (30:4:1, v/v). In the experiment of substrate specificity (Fig. 2), 5 mm 3(2)-t-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole was also included in the stop solution to suppress autoxidation of the compounds containing an unsaturated fatty acyl chain. After centrifugation, 100 μl of the organic phase was spotted on a silica gel thin layer plate (10 cm height) and was developed at 4 °C for 25 min with a mixture of chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (80:20:2, v/v). Distribution of radioactivity on the plate was quantified by a BAS1500 bioimaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). Oleamide hydrolyzing activity was assayed by the same procedure with 200 μm [14C]oleamide. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol hydrolyzing activity was examined by quantification of arachidonic acid produced from 100 μm 2-arachidonoylglycerol using reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (48Goparaju S.K. Ueda N. Yamaguchi H. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For the assay of ceramide hydrolyzing activity, the enzyme was incubated with 100 μm of N-[14C]lauroylsphingosine or N-[14C]palmitoylsphingosine (1000 cpm/nmol, dissolved in 5 μl of ethanol) at 37 °C for 30 min in 100 μl of 100 mm citrate-sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4.5). The mixture also contained 3 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% BSA, and 150 mm NaCl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.32 ml of a mixture of chloroform, methanol, 1 m citric acid (8:4:1, v/v) containing 5 mm 3(2)-t-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole. TLC was performed at room temperature for 25 min with a mixture of chloroform, methanol, acetic acid (94:1:5, v/v). All the enzyme assays were performed in triplicate. In Vitro Processing—HEK293 cells expressing hexahistidine-tagged NAAA were subjected to sonic disruption, and the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The obtained pellet was resuspended in PBS, and the NAAA enzyme was solubilized by two cycles of freezing and thawing, followed by further centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with either citrate-sodium phosphate (pH 4.5) or Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at 25 mm in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 20 or 60 min. The samples were then subjected to the enzyme assay or Western blotting. For PNGase F digestion, an aliquot of the sample (4 μg of protein) was neutralized with 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), denatured in 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min, and digested with 50 units of PNGase F at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40. Western Blotting—After separation by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel under denaturing conditions, proteins were electrotransferred to a Hybond-P membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 overnight and then incubated with anti-hexahistidine antibody (1:5000 dilution) in the blocking buffer at"

Tryptic digestion of the caseins yields phosphopeptides from their polar N-terminal regions that contain clusters of phosphorylated seryl residues. These phosphoseryl clusters have been hypothesized to be responsible for the interaction between the caseins and calcium phosphate that lead to the formation of casein micelles. The casein phosphopeptides stabilize calcium and phosphate ions through the formation of complexes. The calcium phosphate in these complexes is biologically available for intestinal absorption and remineralization of subsurface lesions in tooth enamel. We have studied the structure of the complexes formed by the casein phosphopeptides with calcium phosphate using a range of physicochemical techniques including x-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and equilibrium binding analyses. The amorphous nature of the calcium phosphate phase was confirmed by two independent methods: x-ray powder diffraction and selected area diffraction. In solution, the ion activity product of a basic amorphous calcium phosphate phase was the only ion product that was a function of bound phosphate independent of pH, consistent with basic amorphous calcium phosphate being the phase stabilized by the casein phosphopeptides. Detailed investigations of calcium and calcium phosphate binding using a library of synthetic homologues and analogues of the casein phosphopeptides have revealed that although the fully phosphorylated seryl-cluster motif is pivotal for the interaction with calcium and phosphate, other factors are also important. In particular, calcium binding and calcium phosphate stabilization by the peptides was influenced by peptide net charge, length, and sequence.

In particular, calcium binding and calcium phosphate stabilization by the peptides was influenced by peptide net charge, length, and sequence. Bovine milk contains ∼30 mm calcium and 22 mm inorganic phosphate in solution with most of the calcium (68%) and phosphate (47%) associated with the proteins αS1-, αS2-, β-, and κ-casein in casein micelles (1Walstra P. Jenness R. Dairy Chemistry and Physics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984Google Scholar, 2Van Hooydonk A.C.M. Boerrigter I.J. Hagedoorn H.G. Neth. Milk Dairy J. 1986; 40: 297-313Google Scholar). The αS1-, αS2-, and β-caseins have a number of Ser(P) residues in a specific motif, Ser(P)3-Glu2, that is involved in the interaction with calcium phosphate (3Holt C. Sawyer L. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Many techniques have been used to investigate the ultrastructure of the casein micelles. Although the structural details are still being elucidated, the casein micelles are believed to be roughly spherical particles with a radius of ∼100 nm, dispersed in a continuous phase of water, salt, lactose, and whey proteins (4Schmidt D.G. Dev. Dairy Chem. 1982; 1: 61-86Google Scholar). The calcium phosphate isolated after exhaustive hydrazine deproteination of micelles has been reported to exhibit a fine and uniform granularity under the electron microscope with the particles consisting of small subunits of 2.5-nm diameter (5McGann T.C. Kearney R.D. Buchheim W. Posner A.S. Betts F. Blumenthal N.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1983; 35: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6McGann T.C. Buchheim W. Kearney R.D. Richardson T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 760: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The calcium phosphate, present as nanometer-sized ion clusters, and caseins are not covalently bound; hence the casein micelle is known as an association colloid (7de Kruif C.G. Int. Dairy J. 1999; 9: 183-188Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the casein micelles are extremely stable and can withstand boiling, freeze-drying, and the addition of salt and ethanol. It is believed that the amphipathic, glycosylated C-terminal end of κ-casein protrudes from the micelle surface forming a so-called “hairy layer” that sterically stabilizes the complexes (8Holt C. Horne D.S. Neth. Milk Dairy J. 1996; 50: 85-111Google Scholar). The literature on casein interactions has been reviewed by Horne (9Horne D. Int. Dairy J. 1998; 8: 171-177Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar), and a model of the casein micelle has been formulated that accounts for many of the physicochemical properties of the micelle. The model involves electrostatic interactions between colloidal calcium phosphate particles and multiple α- and β-casein molecules and hydrophobic interactions between the α-, β-, and κ-caseins forming a cross-linked network (9Horne D. Int. Dairy J. 1998; 8: 171-177Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of casein micelles (10Dalgleish D.G. Spagnuolo P.A. Goff H.D. Int. Dairy J. 2004; 14: 1025-1031Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar) has provided evidence that the caseins are organized into tubular structures within the micelle. The casein micelles serve as a carrier of calcium phosphate providing the neonate with a bioavailable source of calcium and phosphate ions for bone and teeth formation (3Holt C. Sawyer L. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the ability of casein to form stable complexes with calcium phosphate is intrinsic to a general mechanism for avoiding pathological calcification and regulating calcium flow in tissues and biological fluids containing high concentrations of calcium (11Holt C. Wahlgren N.M. Drakenberg T. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The ability of casein micelles to maintain calcium and phosphate ions in a soluble and bioavailable state is retained by the tryptic multiphosphorylated peptides of the caseins known as the casein phosphopeptides (CPP) 1The abbreviations used are: CPP, casein phosphopeptide(s); ACP, amorphous calcium phosphate; CN, casein; DCPD, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate; HA, hydroxyapatite; OCP, octacalcium phosphate; SEM, scanning electron microscopy; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: CPP, casein phosphopeptide(s); ACP, amorphous calcium phosphate; CN, casein; DCPD, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate; HA, hydroxyapatite; OCP, octacalcium phosphate; SEM, scanning electron microscopy; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. (12Reynolds E.C. Black C.L. Cai F. Cross K.J. Eakins D. Huq N.L. Morgan M.V. Nowicki A. Perich J.W. Riley P.F. Shen P. Talbo G. Webber F. J. Clin. Dent. 1999; 10: 86-88Google Scholar). The major tryptic CPP are β-CN(1–25) (sequence 1 below) and αS1-CN(59–79) (sequence 2 below) with smaller amounts of αS2-CN(46–70) (sequence 3 below) and αS2-CN(1–21) (sequence 4 below) (13Reynolds E.C. Riley P.F. Adamson N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Adamson N.J. Riley P.F. Reynolds E.C. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 646: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These peptides all contain the cluster sequence motif Ser(P)3-Glu2 with three contiguous phosphoserines. This peptide motif is thought to be critical for calcium and calcium phosphate binding by these peptides (12Reynolds E.C. Black C.L. Cai F. Cross K.J. Eakins D. Huq N.L. Morgan M.V. Nowicki A. Perich J.W. Riley P.F. Shen P. Talbo G. Webber F. J. Clin. Dent. 1999; 10: 86-88Google Scholar). The sequences of the four major casein tryptic phosphopeptides are shown with the motif underlined: sequence 1 (β-CN(1–25)), Arg1-Glu-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu-Asn-Val-Pro-Gly-Glu-Ile-Val-Glu-Ser(P)-Leu-Ser(P)3-Glu2-Ser-Ile-Thr-Arg25; sequence 2 (αS1-CN(59–79)), Gln59-Met-Glu-Ala-Glu-Ser(P)-Ile-Ser(P)3-Glu2-Ile-Val-Pro-Asn-Ser(P)-Val-Glu-Gln-Lys79; sequence 3 (αS2-CN(46–70)), Asn46-Ala-Asn-Glu-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Ser-Ile-Gly-Ser(P)3-Glu2-Ser(P)-Ala-Glu-Val-Ala-Thr-Glu-Glu-Val-Lys70; and sequence 4 (αS2-CN(1–21)), Lys1-Asn-Thr-Met-Glu-His-Val-Ser(P)3-Glu2-Ser-Ile-Ile-Ser(P)-Gln-Glu-Thr-Tyr-Lys21. The CPP stabilize calcium and phosphate ions under neutral and alkaline conditions forming metastable solutions that are supersaturated with respect to the basic calcium phosphate phases (15Reynolds E.C. Cain C.J. Webber F.L. Black C.L. Riley P.F. Johnson I.H. Perich J.W. J. Dent. Res. 1995; 74: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the CPP bind their equivalent weights of calcium and phosphate (16Reeves R.E. Science. 1958; 128: 472Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The CPP are formed in vivo by normal digestion of casein and, because they are relatively resistant to further proteolytic degradation, accumulate in the distal portion of the small intestine (17Mykkanen H.M. Wasserman R.H. J. Nutr. 1980; 110: 2141-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Lee Y.S. Noguchi T. Naito H. Brit. J. Nutr. 1983; 49: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Lee S.L. Veis A. J. Pept. Prot. Res. 1980; 16: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Meisel H. Fristar H. Biol. Chem.

It has been proposed that this accumulation together with the ability of the peptides to form soluble complexes with calcium phosphate are responsible for the enhanced intestinal calcium absorption that has been observed even in vitamin D-deficient animals consuming dietary CPP (17Mykkanen H.M. Wasserman R.H. J. Nutr. 1980; 110: 2141-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Lee Y.S. Noguchi T. Naito H. Brit. J.

In addition, CPP increase the calcification of in vitro cultured embryonic rat bone, and again the mechanism is suggested to be associated with the ability of the peptide to form soluble complexes with calcium and phosphate ions (22Gerber H.W. Jost R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CPP-calcium phosphate complexes have been shown to be anticariogenic and to remineralize early stages of enamel caries in animal and human studies (12Reynolds E.C. Black C.L. Cai F. Cross K.J. Eakins D. Huq N.L. Morgan M.V. Nowicki A. Perich J.W. Riley P.F. Shen P. Talbo G. Webber F. J. Clin. Dent. 1999; 10: 86-88Google Scholar, 15Reynolds E.C. Cain C.J. Webber F.L. Black C.L.

Reynolds E.C. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 2066-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In summary, the ability to stabilize calcium phosphate and thereby enhance mineral solubility and bioavailability (26Kitts D.D. Yuan Y.V. Nagasawa T. Moriyama Y. Brit. J. Nutr. 1992; 68: 765-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) confers upon the CPP the potential to be biological delivery vehicles for calcium and phosphate (27Ferraretto A. Signorile A. Gravaghi C. Fiorilli A. Tettamanti G. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As part of our long term investigation into the structure-function relationships of proteins involved in biomineralization and calcium phosphate stabilization, we have studied the interaction of tryptic phosphopeptides from milk caseins with the amorphous and crystalline phases of calcium phosphate. In this paper, we report our investigations of the calcium and phosphate binding properties of the two major CPP, β-CN(1–25) and αS1-CN(59–79). We demonstrate that the experimentally determined ion activity product of a basic amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) phase best correlates with the calcium bound by the peptide αS1-CN(59–79) over a range of calcium and phosphate concentrations and sample pH ranging from 7.0 to 9.0. Furthermore, we delineate the regions and residues of these peptides that are responsible for calcium phosphate stabilization. We report the effect of peptide length, residue type, and order of acidic residues on the binding to calcium and calcium phosphate using a library of synthetic analogues. Finally, we describe the ultrastructure of the casein phosphopeptide-calcium phosphate nanocomplex as determined using a range of physicochemical techniques including powder diffraction x-ray crystallography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Preparation of Casein Phosphopeptides—The casein phosphopeptides β-CN(1–25) and αS1-CN(59–79) were selectively precipitated from a tryptic digest of casein using calcium chloride and ethanol and further purified by anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography and reversed phase HPLC (13Reynolds E.C. Riley P.F. Adamson N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The purity of the peptides was assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, amino acid composition, and sequence analyses (13Reynolds E.C. Riley P.F. Adamson N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Adamson N.J. Riley P.F. Reynolds E.C. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 646: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Prior to sequence analysis, the labile phosphoseryl residues were converted to S-ethyl cysteinyl residues by β-elimination (13Reynolds E.C. Riley P.F. Adamson N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Preparation of Synthetic Peptides—The peptide Ac-Glu-Ser(P)-Ile-Ser(P)3-Glu2-NHMe corresponding to αS1-CN(63–70) was prepared by the use of Boc-Ser(PO3Ph2)-OH in the Boc mode of peptide synthesis followed by platinum-catalyzed hydrogenolytic deprotection of the protected Ser(PO3Ph2)-containing peptides (14Adamson N.J. Riley P.F. Reynolds E.C. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 646: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Perich J.W. Johns R.B. Reynolds E.C. Aust. J.

The synthetic peptides were capped with an acyl group at the N terminus and a methylamine group at the C terminus. In the case of Ac-Ile-Val-Pro-Asn-Ser(P)-Val-Glu-Glu-NHMe, a homologue of αS1-CN(71–78), a glutamyl residue was substituted for Gln78 to avoid a problematic synthesis associated with a C-terminal glutamine residue. The preparations of the other synthetic analogues have been described previously (29Perich J.W. Kelly D.P. Reynolds E.C. Int. J. Pept. Prot. Res. 1992; 40: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Perich J.W. Method Enzymol. 1991; 201: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31Perich J.W. Terzi E. Carnazzi E. Seyer R. Trifilieff E. Int. J. Pept. Prot. Res. 1994; 44: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by reversed phase HPLC, and the purity was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis, amino acid composition, sequence analysis, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy (13Reynolds E.C.

Calcium Binding to αS1-CN(59–79), β-CN(1–25), αS1-CN(63–70), and αS1-CN(71–78)—All calcium binding experiments were performed using a modification of the ultrafiltration method of Marsh (32Marsh M.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) without the addition of phosphate. The solutions were buffered using 100 mm Tris-HCl to a pH value of 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, or 9.0. Ionic strength was adjusted to 0.16–0.19 using NaCl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 18 h. Subsequently, less than 10% of the total volume was collected as ultrafiltrate by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min using Centrifree MPS-1 Micropartition cells (Amicon) equipped with YM-3 (3000 molecular weight exclusion limit) or YM-1 (1000 molecular weight exclusion limit) membranes. These membranes were demonstrated not to retain calcium or phosphate ions or ion pairs. Calcium ion concentrations of acidified samples were measured at 422.7 nm by atomic absorption spectroscopy using PerkinElmer instrument model 373, with the addition of 1% LaCl3 to prevent phosphate interference. Calcium concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 21.5 mm for αS1-CN(59–79) and β-CN(1–25), 0.3–5.5 mm Ca2+ for the αS1-CN(63–70) peptide, and 0.05–1.5 mm Ca2+ for the αS1-CN(71–78) peptide. The calcium concentrations of the original reaction mixture after centrifugation to demonstrate no precipitation and of the ultrafiltrate were determined, and the peptide-bound calcium was calculated as the difference between these values. Calcium binding by the peptides was modeled by assuming the number of independent ion-binding sites/peptide (νCa), where each site has a dissociation constant (Kd) given by the following equation.Kd=[Peptide]⋅[Ca2+][Peptide⋅Ca2+](Eq. 1) The dissociation constants for the peptide/calcium complexes (Kd) and the number of calcium ion-binding sites/mol of peptide (νCa) were determined by a nonlinear least squares fit to the equation,[Ca2+]bound=νCa[Ca2+]freeK+[Ca2+]free(Eq. 2) where K = Kd. Calcium Phosphate Binding to αS1-CN(59–79) and β-CN(1–25) Homologues and Analogues—Binding was initiated by adding phosphate to solutions containing 14 mm calcium and 4 mg/ml peptide buffered using 100 mm Tris-HCl to a pH value of 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, or 9.0. Sodium chloride was added to bring the ionic strength for each sample to 0.16. For the homologues and analogues, binding was determined at pH 7.0 or 9.0. The reaction mixtures were incubated and ultrafiltered as described above for calcium binding. The phosphate concentration ranged from 0 to 9 mm. Phosphate concentration was determined colorimetrically (33Itaya K. Ui M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1966; 14: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), with absorbance measured at 660 nm on a PerkinElmer 552 Spectrophotometer. Calcium and phosphate concentrations in the original solution and the ultrafiltrate were determined. The peptide bound calcium and peptide bound phosphate were taken as the difference between the total and free calcium and phosphate, respectively. To confirm that no precipitation had occurred during incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 5 min, and the calcium and phosphate concentrations were determined prior to ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltrates were examined spectroscopically at 214 nm and were found to contain no peptide. Peptide-bound calcium phosphate is expressed as the number of calcium ions ([Ca2+]bound) and phosphate ions ([Pi]bound)/mol of peptide. The ion activity products for various phases of calcium phosphate were determined from the free calcium and phosphate concentrations and pH using an iterative computational procedure that calculates the ion activity coefficients using the expanded Debye-Hückel equation. This procedure takes into account ion pairs CaHPO40,CaH2PO4+, and CaPO4−,; the dissociation of H3PO4 and H2O; and the ionic strength (32Marsh M.E.

The activity of the CaOH+ ion was explicitly assumed to be negligible. Dissociation constants at 37 °C were used from the following sources: H2PO4−(35); HPO42−(36); CaH2PO4+ and CaHPO40(37); and CaPO4−(38). The sources of the solubility products at 37 °C were hydroxyapatite (HA) (39McDowell H. Gregory T.M. Brown W.E. J. Res. Natl. Bur. Stand. Sect. A. 1977; 81A: 273-281Crossref Google Scholar), octacalcium phosphate (OCP) (40.Shyu, L. J.

Calcium and phosphate binding was modeled as occurring at multiple independent sites within the peptide with each site having a Kd2 defined by the following equation.Kd2=[Peptide]⋅[Ca2+]⋅[Pi][Peptide⋅Ca2+⋅Pi](Eq. 3) The number of phosphate binding sites was determined by nonlinear least squares fits to an equation of the form of Equation 2, in which bound and free phosphate were the variables. The value of K from these fits can be shown to be approximately given by the equation,K=Kd2Kd(Eq. 4) where Kd is the calcium ion binding constant for the peptide. The number of calcium binding sites was similarly determined using the equation,[Ca2+]bound=νCa[Pi]freeK+[Pi]free+[Ca2+]initial(Eq. 5) where [Ca2+]Initial is the amount of calcium bound with no added phosphate. Preparation of CPP-Calcium Phosphate—CPP was dissolved at 10 g/liter in Milli-Q water. 1.6 m CaCl2 and 1 m Na2HPO4 were added slowly by syringe pump (0.5–1.0 ml/min) to the CPP solution in a pH-stat held at pH 9.0 by automatic titration of 5 n NaOH. After 60 min of titration the final calcium and inorganic phosphate concentration were 100 and 60 mm, respectively. The colloidal CPP-calcium phosphate nanocomplexes were then concentrated 5-fold by microfiltration through a 0.1-μm Sartorius filter (polyolefin) in a mini-Sarticon microfiltration system and washed with 3 volumes of Milli-Q water to remove free calcium and phosphate ions. The final CPP-calcium phosphate solutions were then lyophilized. Preparation of β-CN(1–25)-Calcium Phosphate—The β-CN(1–25) phosphopeptide was dissolved at 1.67 g/liter in Milli-Q water. To the peptide solution, 50 mm CaCl2 and 21.3 mm Na2HPO4 were added stepwise slowly. The pH was held at 9.0 by automatic titration of 50 mm NaOH. The final β-CN(1–25)-ACP solution was then lyophilized and then redissolved in H2O. Powder Diffraction of CPP-ACP—The powdered samples were mounted in an aluminum holder and were placed in a Sintag pad V x-ray diffractometer, operating with a Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) x-ray source at 45 kV and 40 mA. The x-ray diffraction data were collected with a germanium solid state collector and scanned from 10° to 100° in 2θ at 2° min-1 (step size 0.03°). Phase identification was accomplished by comparison of the x-ray diffraction data pattern with the JCPDS powder diffraction file, produced by the International Center for Diffraction Data. SEM and TEM of CPP-ACP—The sample for TEM was prepared from powdered material that was crushed and placed on a 3-mm TEM grid. The TEM grids were covered with a Butvar/Formvar (ProSciTec, Thuringowa Central, Australia) film to support the powder. Transmission electron micrographs were taken on a 200-kV JEOL 200CX instrument operating at 200 kV. For SEM, specimens were sprinkled on an aluminum stub covered with adhesive conductive carbon tabs and gold sputter-coated (Gold Sputter coater S150B, Edwards, UK). Observations were made with a field emission SEM instrument (Philips XL 30 FEG, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) operating at 20 kV using the secondary electron mode. Calcium Binding to αS1-CN(59–79), β-CN(1–25), αS1-CN(63–70), and αS1-CN(71–78)—Fig. 1 shows the calcium-binding curves for (a) αS1-CN(59–79) and (b) αS1-CN(63–70) with the bound calcium/mol of peptide ([Ca2+]bound) being plotted as a function of free calcium ion concentration. Table I summarizes the values of the dissociation constants and the number of calcium ion-binding sites/peptide from fitting the data for αS1-CN(59–79), β-CN(1–25), and αS1-CN(63–70) to Equation 2 using a nonlinear least squares algorithm. In the case of the C-terminal region αS1-CN(71–78) homologue containing only a single phosphoserine, no calcium binding was observed.Table ICalcium binding characteristics of the casein phosphopeptidesPeptidepHVCaavCa = number of calcium-binding sites/molecule of peptideKdαS1-Casein(63-70)8.003.52 ± 0.13bMeans ± S.D.

Peptide-bound calcium and phosphate were determined by the difference in the total and free calcium and phosphate concentrations, respectively. The quantity [Ca2+]bound−[Ca2+]bound0, where [Ca2+]bound0 is the calcium bound in the absence of phosphate, represents the additional calcium bound in the presence of phosphate. This quantity has been plotted versus free phosphate (Pi) in Fig. 2A. Fig. 2B shows a plot of bound phosphate ([Pi]bound) versus free Pi. Nonlinear least squares fits were performed to determine the number of mol of calcium and phosphate bound and the effective dissociation constant K. The fits to Equation 5 showed a strong correlation between the value of [Ca2+]bound0 and the value of K. If [Ca2+]bound0 was not constrained, it adopted unreasonable values, and the value of K determined from fits to the phosphate data disagreed with those determined from the calcium data. Fixing [Ca2+]bound0 at the experimental value of the bound calcium ion concentration at zero phosphate gave values of K in reasonable agreement with those derived from the phosphate data. The number of calcium ion-binding sites/mol of peptide (νCa) was not sensitive to the value of [Ca2+]bound0. The values reported in Table II are appropriately weighted averages of the experimental parameters determined from repeated measurements. Fig. 2C, a plot of [Ca2+]boundversus [Pi]bound for the samples at different pH, reveals a linear relationship between bound calcium and bound phosphate. This demonstrates that the binding of calcium ions and phosphate ions is co-dependent. The number of calcium phosphate binding sites/mol of peptide shows a strong correlation with the length of the peptide as shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, the ratio of [Ca2+]boundversus [Pi]bound increases as the peptides become shorter (Table II).Table IICalcium and phosphate binding characteristics of CPP and analoguesPeptidepHC"

In COS7 cells, treatment with TGFβ increased PI3 kinase activity as measured by the ability of p85-associated immune complexes to phosphorylate inositides in vitro. Both type I and type II TGFβ receptors (TβR) associated with p85, but the association of TβRII appeared to be constitutive. The interaction of TβRI with p85 was induced by treatment with TGFβ. The receptor association with PI3 kinase was not direct as 35S-labeled rabbit reticulocyte p85 did not couple with fusion proteins containing type I and type II receptors. A kinase-dead, dominant-negative mutant of TβRII blocked ligand-induced p85-TβRI association and PI3 kinase activity. In TβRI-null R1B cells, TGFβ did not stimulate PI3 kinase activity. This stimulation was restored upon reconstitution of TβRI by transfection. In R1B and NMuMG epithelial cells, overexpression of a dominant active mutant form of TβRI markedly enhanced ligand-independent PI3 kinase activity, which was blocked by the addition of the TβRI kinase inhibitor LY580276, suggesting a causal link between TβRI function and PI3 kinase. Overexpressed Smad7 also prevented ligand-induced PI3 kinase activity. Taken together, these data suggest that 1) TGFβ receptors can indirectly associate with p85, 2) both receptors are required for ligand-induced PI3 kinase activation, and 3) the activated TβRI serine-threonine kinase can potently induce PI3 kinase activity.

Following ligand binding to TβRII, the type I receptor is recruited to the ligand-receptor complex where the constitutively active TβRII transactivates TβRI (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Activated TβRI phosphorylates the receptor-specific Smad2 and Smad3, which then associate with Smad4 and, as a heteromeric complex, translocate to the nucleus where they regulate the transcription of TGFβ target genes (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). The Smad signaling pathway mediates the antiproliferative effect of TGFβ in epithelial cells (2Liu X. Sun Y.

Several non-Smad pathways have also been implicated in mediating the cellular effects of TGFβ. These include the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Jnk), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3) kinase, and the family of Rho GTPases (4Wakefield L.M.

Activated PI3 kinase increases the formation of intracellular 3′-phosphorylated inositol lipids, signal transducers that are essential for the regulation of cell cycle progression, glucose metabolism, cell motility, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and apoptosis among others (6Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 7Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar). In Swiss 3T3 cells, TGFβ stimulates PI3 kinase activity, as measured by the ability of immune complexes precipitated with an antibody against p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase, to induce the formation of phosphatidylinositol-3 monophosphate (PI3P) in vitro (8Higaki M. Shimokado K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2127-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In mammary epithelial cells, TGFβ induces epithelial-tomesenchymal transition and cell motility as well as phosphorylation and activation of the PI3 kinase-dependent Akt serinethreonine kinase. These responses are blocked by LY294002, a small molecule inhibitor of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3 kinase (9Bakin A.V. Tomlinson A.K. Bhowmick N.A. Moses H.L. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol.

Inhibition of PI3 kinase reverses the fibroblastoid phenotype of TGFβ-treated Ras-transformed hepatocytes to an epithelial phenotype (13Gotzmann J. Huber H. Thallinger C. Wolschek M. Jansen B.

Furthermore, PI3 kinase inhibition abrogates both basal and TGFβ-induced motility in mammary cancer cells (9Bakin A.V. Tomlinson A.K. Bhowmick N.A. Moses H.L. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol.

Taken together, these data suggest that PI3 kinase is a major effector pathway of the transforming effects of TGFβ in epithelial cells. Therefore, in this study, we have examined the initial mechanisms of TGFβ-induced activation of PI3 kinase in epithelial cells. Cell Lines and Antibodies—COS7 and NMuMG cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). R1B cells were provided by Harold Moses (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). COS7 and R1B cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). NMuMG cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 μg/ml insulin. We utilized the following antibodies: p85 (Upstate Biotechnology), Smad2/3 (Transduction Laboratories), hemagglutinin (HA) rabbit polyclonal and TβRI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG epitope (Sigma), Ser-473 P-Akt, total Akt, P-MAPK, total MAPK (Erk42/44), and P-Smad2 (Cell Signaling). Human recombinant TGFβ1 was obtained from R&D Systems. The PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin was from Calbiochem. The TβRI kinase inhibitor LY580276 was provided by Jonathan Yingling (Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). Plasmids and Viral Vectors—The pCMV6-p85 construct tagged with c-myc in its C terminus was provided by Lewis Cantley (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The pRK5-TβRII-Flag plasmid was provided by Rik Derynck. The retroviral vector pGabe-TβRIIK277R-HA was from Martin Oft (both at the University of California at San Francisco) and has been described previously (14Oft M. Heider K.H. Beug H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type TβRI-HA construct, from Kohei Miyazono (Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo), was subcloned into the retroviral expression vector pBMN-IRES-EGFP (provided by Garry Nolan, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) (15Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with plasmids using Fu-GENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Retroviruses were prepared by transfection of 293T cells with 15 μg of DNA/100-mm dish of three plasmids encoding gag/pol, VSV-G, and the target construct (in 4:3:8 ratios, respectively). Supernatants from cells were collected for 2 days and combined, filtered through 0.4-μm filters, and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. R1B cells were infected with supernatant containing retroviruses in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) as described previously (16Yee J.K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9564-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Three days after transduction of R1B cells with pBMN-IRES-EGFP, EGFP-positive cells were selected by flow cytometry. Under these conditions, >95% of selected cells expressed GFP at the time of any of our experiments. The HA-Alk5T204D and Flag-Smad7 adenoviral constructs were also from Dr. Kohei Miyazono. Stocks of recombinant adenoviruses were generated in 293T cells and titered utilizing the Takara assay (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were then infected with these or with a control β-galactosidase adenovirus at an equivalent multiplicity of infection as described previously (17Dumont N. Bakin A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) on ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, and protein concentrations were then determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. Immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose 4B or protein A-Sepharose 4B (both from Sigma) at 4 °C for 3 h. The precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer, once with high salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl) and once with low salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The final pellets were boiled in Laemmli buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and separated by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis, 20–30 μg of total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were incubated with primary antibody in 4 °C for 16 h, washed three times with TBST for 1 h, incubated for 2 h with secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), and then washed three times with TBST for an additional 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) as described (17Dumont N. Bakin A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assays—The expression vectors for glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, pGEX4T and pGEX4T-TβRI (a gift from Pran Datta, Vanderbilt University) and pGEX2T-TβRII (provided by Rik Derynck, UCSF) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 strain. The bacterial cultures were induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 37 °C. E. coli were pelleted, washed with STE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and incubated in STE buffer containing 100 μg of lysozyme for 15 min on ice. Protease inhibitors, 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1.5% sarcosyl were added to the resuspended E. coli, which were next sonicated. Bacterial lysates were brought up in 4% Triton, 10 μg of DNase, and 8 mm MgCl2 and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. GST fusion proteins were purified by binding to glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h before washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. The concentration of proteins immobilized on beads was estimated by SDS-PAGE and semi-quantitated against bovine serum albumin standards (Sigma) after staining the SDS gel with Coomassie Blue. Binding assays were performed between GST fusion proteins and in vitro translated p85 protein. p85 was generated with a TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) also containing pCMV6-p85-myc, T7 polymerase, and 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Biosciences). 10 μl of 35S-labeled p85 protein and equal amounts of immobilized GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer, once with high salt buffer and once with low salt buffer. The beads were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. PI3 Kinase Assay—PI3 kinase catalytic activity was measured in vitro as described previously (18Carpenter C.L. Tolias K.F. Couvillon A.C. Hartwig J.H. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer A (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) and a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were precipitated with a p85 antibody and protein A-Sepharose 4B. After 2 washes in 1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer A and 2 washes in assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA), the precipitates were resuspended in 80 μl of assay buffer containing 10 μl of crude brain phosphoinositides (PI, 2 mg/ml; Sigma) and 10 μl of substrate (500 μm cold ATP with 10 μCi/1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in 200 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 50 mm MgCl2). Following gentle agitation for 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The radiolabeled lipids were extracted, concentrated, and separated by TLC using silica gel plates pretreated with 1% w/v K oxalate in a solvent system of n-propanol:2 m acetic acid (65:35 v/v). The incorporation of 32P into PI was detected by autoradiography. p85, the Regulatory Subunit of PI3 Kinase, Can Bind Both TβRII and TβRI—In serum-starved COS7 cells, addition of TGFβ stimulated PI3 kinase activity in a time-dependent fashion as measured by the ability of immune complexes precipitated with p85 antibodies to stimulate formation of 3′-phosphorylated inositol lipids in vitro. This induction was maximal at 6 h and temporally correlated with phosphorylation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt in Ser-473 (Fig. 1). The kinetics of ligand-induced Smad2 phosphorylation were faster with maximal induction seen after treatment with TGFβ for 1 h. To determine whether p85 interacted directly with TGFβ receptors, we co-transfected COS7 cells with vectors encoding p85 and TβRI or TβRII followed by immunoprecipitation with receptor antibodies. p85 was detectable in TβRI and TβRII pull downs from cells co-transfected with the respective combination of vectors (Fig. 2A). To determine whether this binding is modulated by TGFβ, COS7 cells were stimulated with TGFβ for variable times. The binding between p85 and TβRI was maximal 1 h after TGFβ treatment, and this association was correlated with maximal induction of Smad2 and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, left). However, binding between p85 and TβRII was not affected by exogenous TGFβ even though in these co-transfected cells a more modest ligand-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Akt was still observed (Fig. 2B, right). To determine whether this p85-TGFβ receptor association was direct, we co-incubated rabbit reticulocyte 35S-labeled p85 with GST-TβRI and with GST-TβRII fusion proteins (Fig. 2C). Under these conditions, we were unable to recover labeled p85 from the immobilized GST-TGFβ receptor fusions, implying that the p85-TβRI and p85-TβRII associations, as supported by the prior co-precipitation experiments in transfected cells (Fig. 2, A and B), were not direct. TβRII and TβRI Are Required for Ligand-mediated Activation of PI3 Kinase—To investigate whether TβRII function is required for ligand-induced activation of PI3 kinase, we cotransfected COS7 cells with p85 and TβRI with or without a vector encoding a kinase-inactive TβRII mutant in which the lysine at position 277 has been mutated to arginine (14Oft M. Heider K.H. Beug H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the TβRIIK277R construct prevented ligand-induced association of p85 with TβRI (Fig. 3A). In cells co-transfected with p85 and TβRI, we were unable to detect an increase in TGFβ-induced PI3 kinase activity associated with p85 precipitates (data not shown). We speculate that under these conditions, the majority of the overexpressed p85 protein is not associated with TβRI, and thus, the p85-associated catalytic activity does not reflect ligand-induced, TGFβ receptor-associated PI3 kinase activity. Therefore, we transfected TβRI without p85 but with or without TβRIIK277R. The expression of the kinase-dead type II receptor abrogated a ligand-mediated increase in PI3 kinase activity in vitro (Fig. 3B). This is different from the slower kinetics of ligand-induced activation observed in untransfected COS7 cells (Fig. 1). In COS7 cells transfected with TβRI, but not with TβRII, exogenous TGFβ maximally increased PI3 kinase activity at 1 h. We did not detect any PI3 kinase activity in TβRI precipitates. To examine whether TβRI was required for ligand-induced activation of PI3 kinase, we used R1B cells, a subline of Mv1Lu cells, which lacks type I receptors (19Zhu H.J. Sizeland A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11773-11781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). R1B cells were transduced with pBMN-IRES-EGFP or pBMN-TβRI (Alk5)-IRES-EGFP retroviral vectors; EGFP-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry. In all our experiments, >95% of cells used expressed GFP. In TβRI-reconstituted cells but not in cells transduced with the control retrovirus, treatment with TGFβ induced PI3 kinase activity as well as Smad2 and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Active TβRI (Alk5T204D) Can Induce PI3 Kinase Activity— Because p85 can bind TβRII (Fig. 2), we next determined whether overexpression of TβRII was permissive for ligand-induced PI3 kinase and P-Akt and compared these with the kinetics of activation observed in untransfected COS7 cells (Fig. 1). In COS7 cells overexpressing transfected TβRII, TGFβ maximally induced PI3 kinase activity and Ser-473 P-Akt at 6 h (Fig. 5) suggesting that an excess of type II receptor did not accelerate PI3 kinase activation compared with untransfected cells. We were unable to detect any PI3 kinase activity in immune complexes precipitated with TβRII antibodies (not shown). The studies above had shown that in cells overexpressing transfected p85 and TβRI, the association of p85 and type I receptors was maximal after 1 h of treatment with TGFβ (Fig. 2B). Moreover, in COS7 and R1B cells overexpressing transfected TβRI, maximal ligand-induced activation of PI3 kinase was evident after 1 h of treatment (Figs. 3B and 4B), suggesting that TβRI can accelerate the activation of PI3 kinase. Therefore, to test whether TβRI can activate PI3 kinase, we transduced NMuMG and R1B cells with an HA-tagged adenovirus encoding a mutant of TβRI (Alk5T204D). A substitution of threonine 204 with aspartic acid leads to constitutive activation of the type I receptor serine-threonine kinase thus allowing it to signal in the absence of added ligand (20Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In both cells, transduction with a mutant Alk5T204D but not with a β-galactosidase control adenovirus resulted in a marked increase in ligand-independent, p85-associated PI3 kinase activity as well as Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6). To determine whether active Alk5 was causally associated with the enhanced PI3 kinase activity observed, we utilized small molecule TβRI serine-threonine kinase inhibitor LY580276 (21Sawyer J.S. Beight D.W. Britt K.S. Anderson B.D. Campbell R.M. Goodson T. Herron D.K. Li H.Y. McMillen W.T. Mort N. Parsons S. Smith E.C. Wagner J.R. Yan L. Zhang F. Yingling J.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 3581-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). LY580276 is a parafluorophenyl substituted dihydropyrrolopyrazole that is highly selective for TβRI (IC50 0.18 μm, Ki 37 nm) relative to TβRII (IC50 >20 μm), p38α (IC50 >20 μm) and a panel of 39 additional kinases with an IC50 >10 μm. 2J. Yingling, personal communication. It inhibits TGFβ-stimulated p3TP-Lux reporter activity in Mink lung cells (IC50 96 nm) and NIH3T3 proliferation (IC50 39 nm). The crystal structure of LY580276 in Alk5T204D has been solved, which confirms binding at the ATP site (22Singh J. Ling L.E. Sawyer J.S. Lee W.C. Zhang F. Yingling J.M. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2004; 7: 437-445PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with LY580276 for 24 h blocked Alk5T204D-mediated PI3 kinase activation and Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6) supporting a causal association between active Alk5 signaling and the induction of PI3 kinase catalytic activity. Smad7 Blocks Alk5-mediated Activation of PI3 Kinase—To determine whether the activation of PI3 kinase by TβRI requires Smad function, we blocked Smad signaling with the inhibitory Smad7 (23Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 24Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Smad7 stably interacts with activated TβRI thereby blocking the association with phosphorylation and activation of Smad2/3. Overexpressed adenoviral Smad7 blocked Alk5T204D-induced PI3 kinase activity as well as Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7). We have examined whether TGFβ receptors interact with and/or activate PI3 kinase in epithelial cells. Exogenous TGFβ increased PI3 kinase activity as measured by the ability of p85-associated immune complexes to phosphorylate inositides in vitro. The kinetics of ligand-induced PI3 kinase activation were much slower than the phosphorylation of Smad2 with maximal detectable induction 6 h after the addition of TGFβ. Both type I and type II receptors associated with p85, but the association of TβRII appeared constitutive, as it was not enhanced by exogenous ligand. On the other hand, the interaction of TβRI with p85 was markedly enhanced by treatment with TGFβ for 1 h. This receptor association with PI3 kinase was not direct. 35S-Labeled rabbit reticulocyte p85 did not associate with fusion proteins containing type I and type II receptors. In addition, we were unable to detect any PI3 kinase activity in TβRI and TβRII precipitates from TGFβ-stimulated cells. This is consistent with a previous report using TGFβ-stimulated fibroblasts in which PI3 kinase activity was not recovered with a TβRII antibody (8Higaki M. Shimokado K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2127-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results and the slow kinetics of induction of PI3 kinase catalytic activity by TGFβ suggest the presence of signaling intermediates between ligand-bound TGFβ receptors and PI3 kinase. Although TβRII overexpression did not increase TGFβ-induced or uninduced PI3 kinase activity, a kinase-dead, dominant-negative mutant of TβRII blocked ligand-induced p85-TβRI association and PI3 kinase activity suggesting that a functional type II receptor is required for TGFβ-mediated activation of PI3 kinase. These data also imply that in tumors with inactivating mutations in the TGFBR2 gene TGFβ may not be able to engage PI3 kinase and contribute to tumor progression by this effector pathway. In TβRI-null R1B cells, TGFβ did not stimulate PI3 kinase activity. However, this stimulation was restored upon reconstitution of TβRI by transfection. Moreover, the overexpression of TβRI accelerated ligand-induced catalytic activity with maximal induction observed 1 h after the addition of TGFβ. To confirm that the serine-threonine kinase activity of TβRI can activate PI3 kinase, we transduced R1B and NMuMG epithelial cells with a dominant active mutant form of TβRI. In both cell lines, the expression of TβRIT204D markedly enhanced ligand-independent PI3 kinase activity, which was blocked by the addition of the TβRI kinase inhibitor LY580276, strongly suggesting a causal link between TβRI function and PI3 kinase. Finally, overexpressed Smad7, which binds phosphorylated TβRI, prevented ligand-induced PI3 kinase activity as well as Smad2 phosphorylation, implying further that TβRI can associate with and activate PI3 kinase. Despite this causal evidence between TβRI function and TGFβ-mediated activation of PI3 kinase, it is not clear how TβRI stimulates this activity. The level of induction with added ligand is comparable with that reported in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated Swiss 3T3 (8Higaki M. Shimokado K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2127-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and NIH3T3 cells (25Domin J. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21614-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) where the p85-associated PI3 kinase activity is only increased ∼20% over untreated controls. Only 3–10% of cellular PI3 kinase is activated by insulin, colony-stimulating factor-1, or erbB2 receptors (26Downing J.R. Reynolds A.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 607-613PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 28Peles E. Lamprecht R. Ben-Levy R. Tzahar E. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12266-12274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This level of activation probably reflects the large pool of PI3 kinase that is modestly affected by a single growth factor. In human airway smooth muscle cells, for example, TGFβ can induce a detectable increase in PI3 kinase only in the presence of epidermal growth factor (29Krymskaya V.P. Hoffman R. Eszterhas A. Ciocca V. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1220-L1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further consistent with this notion, overexpression of p85 in COS7 cells eliminated the detectable increase in p85-associated PI3 kinase activation in response to an added ligand (data not shown). Nonetheless, the marked induction of p85-associated PI3 kinase observed in cells transduced with the constitutively active TβRIT204D mutant, which was blocked by a pharmacological inhibitor of the type I receptor kinase, provides causal evidence linking TβRI and PI3 kinase activities. Similar results (17Dumont N. Bakin A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have been reported in MDA-231 human breast cancer cells expressing kinase-dead TβRIIK277R: Transduction with an adenovirus encoding activated TβRI induced P-Akt and restored PI3 kinase-dependent cell motility (17Dumont N. Bakin A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). PI3 kinase is usually induced by activated transmembrane tyrosine kinases such as insulin (30Giorgetti S. Ballotti R. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), nerve growth factor (31Carter A.N. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14563-14567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (25Domin J. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21614-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Activated epidermal growth factor receptors (erbB1) or erbB2 can also link to PI3 kinase activity after partnering with erbB3, a co-receptor with six p85-binding sites (32Kim H.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hellyer N.J. Kim H.H. Greaves C.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G.

Upon receptor activation, p85 associates via its SH2 domain with phosphorylated tyrosines within YXXM motifs in the C terminus of the receptor. Because of this, phosphotyrosine antibody precipitates from platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated cells have been shown to contain 50-fold more PI3 kinase activity than unstimulated controls (35Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). YXXM motifs are not present in TβRI or TβRII, which is further in line with the lack of evidence for a direct association between p85 and TGFβ receptors (Fig. 2C). In some cases, the interaction between p85 and receptor tyrosine kinases is also indirect and occurs through intermediate phosphoproteins such as that reported for the insulin receptor substrates IRS1 and IRS2 (36Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Van Obberghen E. March Le -Brustel Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Yamada M. Ohnishi H. Sano S. Nakatani A. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30334-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We were unable to recover any detectable PI3 kinase activity in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from TGFβ-treated cells (data not shown), suggesting that PI3 kinase activation is not mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, we suspect this is the first report of PI3 kinase activation induced by a serine-threonine kinase in epithelial cells. It remains to be determined whether TGFβ-induced PI3 kinase activity is universal among epithelial cells. If in fact, as our data would suggest, PI3 kinase activation requires signaling intermediates, the differential expression of those putative intermediates may specify whether TGFβ can or cannot activate this signaling pathway as well as the magnitude and time course of this activation. Indeed, we have not observed ligand-induced activation of Akt in MCF-10A and MCF-7 human mammary epithelial cells. Because Akt activity is PI3 kinase-dependent, this result would suggest that activation of PI3 kinase by TGFβ is cell type-dependent. The answer to these questions will require further investigation."

Here we show that treatment of rat C6 glioma cells with the raft disruptor methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) doubles the binding efficiency (i.e. the ratio between maximum binding and dissociation constant) of type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R), which belong to the rhodopsin family of G protein-coupled receptors. In parallel, activation of CB1R by the endogenous agonist anandamide (AEA) leads to ∼3-fold higher [35S]GTPγS binding in MCD-treated cells than in controls, and CB1R-dependent signaling via adenylate cyclase, and p42/p44 MAPK is almost doubled by MCD. Unlike CB1R, the other AEA-binding receptor TRPV1, the AEA synthetase NAPE-PLD, and the AEA hydrolase FAAH are not modulated by MCD, whereas the activity of the AEA membrane transporter (AMT) is reduced to ∼50% of the controls. We also show that MCD reduces dose-dependently AEA-induced apoptosis in C6 cells but not in human CHP100 neuroblastoma cells, which mirror the endocannabinoid system of C6 cells but are devoid of CB1R. MCD reduces also cytochrome c release from mitochondria of C6 cells, and this effect is CB1R-dependent and partly mediated by activation of p42/p44 MAPK. Altogether, the present data suggest that lipid rafts control CB1R binding and signaling, and that CB1R activation underlies the protective effect of MCD against apoptosis.

Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). It binds to type-1 and type-2 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R and CB2R), thus playing many actions in the central nervous system (3.Fride E. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent.

Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 319-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The activities of AEA at CB receptors are terminated by cellular uptake through an AEA membrane transporter (AMT) (5.Hillard C.J. Jarrahian A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), followed by hydrolysis to ethanolamine and arachidonic acid by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) (6.Bisogno T.

Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The checkpoint in AEA synthesis is the N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPE)-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), which releases on demand AEA from membrane NAPEs (8.Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Together with AEA and congeners like 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), N-arachidonoyldopamine, noladin ether, and virodhamine, these proteins form the endocannabinoid system (2.De Petrocellis L. Cascio M.G. Di Marzo V. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). One activity of AEA that has attracted growing interest is its ability to induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in neuronal and peripheral cells (9.Maccarrone M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), with therapeutic potential in cancer (10.Guzman M. Nat. Rev.

In a previous study we have shown that the pro-apoptotic activity of AEA occurs through activation of type 1 vanilloid receptors (now called transient receptor potential channel vanilloid receptor subunit 1, TRPV1), which are six transmembrane-spanning proteins with intracellular N and C termini (15.Jordt S.E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In fact, we have shown that AEA is a physiological agonist of TRPV1 (16.De Petrocellis L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12856-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and thus can be also considered a true endovanilloid (17.Van der Stelt M. Di Marzo V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Instead, activation of CB1R protects cells against AEA-induced apoptosis, suggesting that vanilloid and cannabinoid receptors regulate in opposite ways the apoptotic potential of AEA (18.Maccarrone M.

In the last few years the concept of a protective role of CB receptors against (endo)cannabinoid-induced apoptosis has been extended to several cell types, from neuronal and immune cells to endothelial cells and astrocytes (reviewed in Refs. 9.Maccarrone M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar and 10.Guzman M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Recently, two reports from Maruyama's group have shown that methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) blocks apoptosis induced in vitro by AEA in glioma cells (21.Sarker K.P. Maruyama I. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and hepatocytes (22.Biswas K.K. Sarker K.P. Abeyama K. Kawahara K. Iino S. Otsubo Y. Saigo K. Izumi H. Hashiguchi T.

Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8018-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and is widely used to disrupt the integrity of lipid rafts, i.e. subdomains of the plasma membrane that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (24.Kunzelmann-Marche C.

After MCD pretreatment, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then were treated with AEA (or vehicle in the controls) as detailed below. In some experiments, cholesterol repletion was achieved by treating C6 cells with 5 mm MCD, washing in PBS, and then incubating for 15 min at 37 °C with 5 mm cholesterol-MCD complexes (36.Yang N.

Cholesterol Quantitation and Analysis of Cell Membrane Fluidity— Membrane lipids were extracted from C6 cells or CHP100 cells (5 × 106 per test) and cholesterol content was measured by means of cholesterol oxidase (kit from Roche Applied Science), as previously described (38.Maccarrone M. Navarra M. Catani V. Corasaniti M.T. Bagetta G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Membrane fluidity of the cells was determined by means of the fluorescent probe laurdan, as already described (38.Maccarrone M. Navarra M. Catani V. Corasaniti M.T. Bagetta G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Membrane fluidity is inversely proportional to the ratio of laurdan fluorescence at 440 nm versus that at 490 nm (F440/F490): the higher the ratio, the lower the fluidity (39.Parasassi T. Gratton E. Yu W.M. Wilson P. Levi M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2413-2429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Receptor Binding Assays and AEA-stimulated [35S]GTPγS Binding— Membrane fractions were prepared from C6 cells (200 × 106 test), that had been previously treated with MCD as described above, and were used to perform direct binding experiments of [3H]CP55.940 by rapid filtration assays (18.Maccarrone M. Lorenzon T. Bari M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31938-31945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Binding data were elaborated through nonlinear regression analysis, using the Prism 3 program (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA), in order to calculate maximum binding (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) of [3H]CP55.940. Saturation binding of [3H]CP55.940 was further analyzed through Scatchard plots. Direct binding of [3H]RTX was evaluated by rapid filtration assays, performed as reported (40.Ross R.A. Gibson T.M.

Membrane preparations were pre-incubated in 4 milliunits/ml adenosine deaminase (183 units/mg of protein, Sigma) for 10 min at 30 °C. The binding of [35S]GTPγS stimulated by various amounts of AEA was assayed in the presence of 30 μm GDP, 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS, 50 μg of protein and assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) in a final volume of 1 ml. Nonspecific binding was determined in the absence of agonist and in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled GTPγS (41.Breivogel C.S. Selley D.E. Childers S.R. J. Biol.

Determination of AEA Uptake, Synthesis, and Hydrolysis—The activity of the AMT in C6 cells was measured as described (42.Maccarrone M. Bari M. Lorenzon T. Bisogno T. Di Marzo V. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13484-13492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106/test) were incubated for 15 min, at 37 °C or 4 °C, with 400 nm [3H]AEA, then they were washed three times in 2 ml of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and were finally resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. Membrane lipids were then extracted (42.Maccarrone M. Bari M. Lorenzon T. Bisogno T. Di Marzo V. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol.

To discriminate non-carrier-mediated from carrier-mediated transport of AEA through cell membranes, [3H]AEA uptake at 4 °C was subtracted from that at 37 °C (42.Maccarrone M. Bari M. Lorenzon T. Bisogno T. Di Marzo V. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13484-13492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax) of the uptake of [3H]AEA (0–800 nm range) by AMT in C6 cells were determined by nonlinear regression analysis as reported (42.Maccarrone M.

AMT activity was expressed as pmol of AEA taken up per min per mg of protein. The synthesis of [3H]AEA through the activity of NAPE-PLD (EC 3.1.4.4) was assayed in C6 cell homogenates (50 μg/test), using 100 μm [3H]NArPE as reported (8.Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). NAPE-PLD activity was expressed as pmol of [3H]AEA released per min per mg of protein. The hydrolysis of [3H]AEA by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.4; FAAH) activity was assayed in C6 cell extracts (20 μg/test) by measuring the release of [3H]arachidonic acid from 10 μm [3H]AEA at pH 9.0, using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (18.Maccarrone M. Lorenzon T. Bari M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31938-31945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). FAAH activity was expressed as pmol arachidonate released per min per mg of protein. Other Enzymatic Assays—C6 cells (5 × 106/test) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with AEA and related compounds, then they were washed, homogenized and subjected to enzymatic assays. Forskolin (1 μm)-stimulated adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1; AC) activity was determined according to the amount of cAMP (43.Bayewitch M. Avidor-Reiss T. Levy R. Barg J. Mechoulam R. Vogel Z.

AC activity was expressed as pmol cAMP per min per mg of protein. The activity of p42/p44 MAPK (EC 2.7.1.37) was assayed in cell extracts by the phosphorylation of MAPK-specific peptide substrate at 30 °C with adenosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate (44.Bouaboula M. Bianchini L. McKenzie F.R. Pouyssegur J. Casellas P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), using the Biotrak MAPK enzyme assay system (Amersham Biosciences). MAPK activity was expressed as pmol of phosphate per min per mg of protein. The effect of pertussis toxin (PTX) on enzymatic activities was determined by preincubating C6 cells for 3 h at 37 °C with 5 μg/ml PTX before addition of AEA, or vehicle in control experiments (43.Bayewitch M.

Determination of cAMP and Cytochrome c Release—C6 cells (5 × 106 cells/test) were treated with 1 μm forskolin in the presence of different compounds (or vehicle alone in the controls) for 15 min, then medium was discarded and trypsinized cells were homogenized as described (42.Maccarrone M.

Cyclic AMP in the extracts was within the linearity range of the method, calibrated with acetylated cAMP as suggested by the manufacturer. The amount of cytochrome c released into the cytosol of C6 cells or CHP100 cells (25 × 106 cells/test) 8 h after treatment with AEA (18.Maccarrone M. Lorenzon T. Bari M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J.

Here we have addressed this issue by both chemical cross-linking and direct imaging of individual receptors by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Cross-linking of the P2X2 receptor produced higher order adducts, consistent with the presence of trimers. The mean molecular volume of the receptor determined by AFM (409 nm3) also points to a trimeric structure. P2X2 receptors bearing His6 epitope tags were incubated with anti-His6 antibodies, and the resultant complexes were imaged by AFM. For receptors with two bound antibodies, the mean angle between the antibodies was 123°, again indicating that the receptor is a trimer. In contrast, cross-linking of the P2X6 receptor did not produce higher order adducts, and the mean molecular volume of the receptor was 145 nm3. We conclude that P2X2 receptors are trimers, whereas the P2X6 receptor subunits do not form stable oligomers. P2X receptors are cation-selective channels activated by extracellular ATP.

P2X receptors contain an integral cation-selective ion channel that is opened by the binding of extracellular ATP (1Khakh B.S. Nat. Rev.

Seven P2X receptor subunits have been identified, and these subunits associate together to form homo- or hetero-oligomeric receptors. Each subunit has two transmembrane regions (TMRs), 1The abbreviations used are: TMR, transmembrane region; AFM, atomic force microscopy; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; NRK, normal rat kidney; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. which are integrated into the membrane so that both N and C termini are intracellular. The large extracellular domain is glycosylated and contains several cysteine residues that form multiple disulfide bonds. The architecture of P2X receptors is still not clear, although the available evidence favors a trimeric arrangement of subunits, at least for some forms of the receptor. Early indications that the receptors were oligomers arose from electrophysiological studies of both endogenous receptors and exogenously expressed receptors, which revealed that receptor activation had a Hill coefficient greater than 1 (3Bean B.P.

Analysis of the mechanism of blockade of the T336C mutant P2X2 receptor by methanethiosulfonate indicated a trimeric architecture (5Stoop R. Thomas S. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. Buell G. Surprenant A. North A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). More recently, chemical cross-linking of P2X1, P2X2, and P2X3 receptors again pointed to the existence of trimers (6Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E.

Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is fair to say, however, that this issue has not been completely resolved. For instance, under some circumstances, the P2X1, P2X2, and P2X3 receptors have been found to migrate on non-denaturing gels as hexamers and even nonamers (6Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 7Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Further, the extracellular domain of the P2X2 receptor behaves as a stable tetramer in solution (8Kim M. Yoo O.J. Choe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Finally, the P2X6 receptor migrates as a tetramer on native gels (7Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have combined a chemical cross-linking approach with direct imaging of P2X2 and P2X6 receptors by AFM. The ability to visualize single receptors afforded by AFM has permitted the measurement of the molecular volume of the receptors and the determination of the geometry of receptors liganded by antibodies against epitope tags present on the receptor subunits. Our data show convincingly that the P2X2 receptor is a trimer, whereas the P2X6 subunit is not able to form stable oligomers. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—tsA 201 cells (a subclone of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing the SV40 large T-antigen) and normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), at 37 °C and in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. cDNA encoding the rat P2X2 receptor was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/His vector (Invitrogen), which produces a protein tagged at its N terminus with the His6 epitope. cDNA encoding the rat P2X6 receptor, bearing either a hemagglutinin (HA) or a His6 tag at its C terminus, was subcloned into the pEGFP vector, modified to remove the enhanced green fluorescent protein tag (Clontech). Transient transfections of tsA 201 cells with either P2X2 or P2X6 receptor DNA were carried out using the CalPhos™ mammalian transfection kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections of NRK cells were carried out using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen), again according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transfection of one 162-cm2 culture flask, 30 μg of plasmid DNA was used. For smaller numbers of cells, amounts of DNA were scaled down appropriately. After transfection, cells were incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C to allow expression of the P2X receptors. Receptor Cross-linking in Crude Detergent Extracts of Transfected Cells—Transfected NRK cells, growing in 6-well plates, were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and collected directly into lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, containing 1% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The cell lysate was sonicated and then left on ice for 30 min. Samples were cleared by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and incubated either with or without disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS; Pierce & Warriner; 4 mm) for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were quenched by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (final concentration 50 mm; 15 min at room temperature) and terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In some experiments, the denatured P2X6 receptor was deglycosylated by incubation of the cell extract with N-glycanase F (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C. Again, reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The P2X2 receptor was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-receptor antibody (Alomone Laboratories; 1:500); the P2X6 receptor (tagged at its C terminus with the HA epitope) was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Covance Research Products; 1:500). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Perbio or Bio-Rad) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Solubilization and Purification of His6-tagged P2X Receptors—All procedures were carried out at 4 °C and are similar to those described previously for the isolation of the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptor (9Neish C.S. Martin I.L. Davies M. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Nanotechnology. 2003; 14: 864-872Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Control or transfected tsA 201 cells from five 162-cm2 culture flasks were washed twice with 10 ml/flask of HEPES-buffered saline (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6), containing 2 mm EDTA. Afterward, HEPES-buffered saline, containing protease inhibitor mixture, was added to the cells, and the cells were scraped from the flasks. Each flask was rinsed with a further 10 ml of the same buffer. The combined suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, containing protease inhibitor mixture). The cells were lysed for 20 min before homogenization with a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was again centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in solubilization buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% (w/v) CHAPS, containing protease inhibitor mixture) at a protein concentration of 0.5–1.0 mg/ml. The suspension was agitated at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h to pellet unsolubilized material. Ni2+-agarose binding beads (1 ml of 50% slurry; Probond, Invitrogen) were equilibrated by washing three times with 10 ml of wash buffer (HEPES-buffered saline, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 mm imidazole). Solubilized protein was added and incubated with the beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min and then washed three times with wash buffer. The beads were packed into a small column (Invitrogen), and protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole: 2 × 200 mm and 2 × 400 mm in wash buffer (0.5-ml fractions). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein was detected by immunoblotting. The P2X2 receptor was detected using either a mouse monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal His6 tag (Invitrogen; 1:500) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-receptor antibody (see above); a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Roche Applied Science; 1:500) was used as a negative control. The P2X6 receptor was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody against the C-terminal His6 tag (Invitrogen; 1:500). It was found that the majority of the receptor protein was eluted in the second 200 mm imidazole fraction. AFM Imaging of P2X Receptors and Receptor-Antibody Complexes— P2X2 receptors with an N-terminal His6 tag on each subunit were incubated either alone or following incubation with a 1:1 molar ratio (∼0.2 nm each) of mouse monoclonal anti-His6 IgG (Research Diagnostics Inc.) for 14 h at 4 °C. P2X6 receptors were imaged without incubation with antibodies. Proteins were diluted in wash buffer (above) to a final concentration of ∼0.04 nm, and 45 μl of the sample was allowed to adsorb to freshly cleaved, poly-l-lysine-coated mica (Sigma). After a 10-min incubation, the sample was washed with MilliQ-water and dried under nitrogen. Imaging was performed with a Multimode atomic force microscope (Digital Instruments). Samples were imaged in air, using tapping mode with a root-mean-square amplitude of 0.7 V and a drive frequency of ∼300 kHz. Silicon cantilevers with a specified spring constant of 40 Newtons/meter (Mikromasch) were used. The molecular volumes of the protein particles were determined from particle dimensions obtained from AFM images. The heights and radii were measured, usually from two cross-sections of the same particle at 90°, and the molecular volume was calculated using the following equation Vm=(πh/6)(3r2+h2) (Eq. 1) where h is the particle height and r is the radius at the base (10Schneider S.W. Lärmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The equation treats the protein molecules as spherical caps. Molecular volume based on molecular mass was calculated using the equation Vc=(M0/N0)(V1+dV2)(Eq. 2) where M0 is the molecular mass, N0 is Avogadro's number, V1 and V2 are the partial specific volumes of particle and water, respectively, and d is the extent of protein hydration. Because the receptors are glycoproteins, the volume contributions of core protein and attached oligosaccharides were calculated separately, using previously reported values of partial specific volumes for protein (0.74 cm3/g) and carbohydrate (0.61 cm3/g; Ref. 11Durchschlag H. Zipper P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 803-807Crossref Google Scholar). It has been shown (10Schneider S.W. Lärmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) that there are no significant differences in molecular volumes determined by imaging under fluid and in air (as in this study). Thus, for the extent of protein hydration, we used the value of 0.4 g of water/g of protein reported for a typical globular protein (human serum albumin) in solution (12Grant E.H. Phys. Med. Biol. 1957; 2: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When receptors were imaged after incubation with anti-His6 antibodies, note was taken of whether the receptors were untagged or tagged with one, two, or three antibodies. The results obtained were expressed as a percentage of the total number of particles for each sample. Zoomed images of receptors with two antibodies bound were inspected, and the angle separating the two antibodies was measured. The distribution of angles was analyzed, and the sample mean was calculated. All errors quoted are S.E. The subunit stoichiometry of the P2X2 receptor was first investigated by treating crude detergent extracts of transfected NRK cells with the cross-linker DSS. As shown in Fig. 1A, untransfected NRK cells did not express the P2X2 receptor, whereas transfection led to robust receptor expression. The receptor migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a single band of molecular mass 70 kDa, as reported previously (7Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Jiang L.-H. Kim M. Spelta V. Bo X. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8903-8910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When extracts of transfected cells were incubated with DSS, the 70-kDa band became much less prominent, and two new bands, of approximate molecular masses 140 and 210 kDa, appeared. This result is in agreement with a previous report (7Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and indicates that the cross-linker is revealing the presence of dimers and trimers of the receptor subunits. To obtain more direct structural information, the P2X2 receptor was isolated from transfected tsA 201 cells and analyzed by AFM. Membrane fractions of the transfected cells were solubilized in the detergent CHAPS, and the receptor was isolated through its binding to Ni2+-agarose columns via its N-terminal His6 tag. As shown in Fig. 1B, the isolated receptor could be detected as a 70-kDa band on blots probed with either an anti-His6 antibody or an anti-P2X2 receptor antibody. In contrast, the 70-kDa band was not detected by an antibody against the Myc epitope, which is not present in the receptor. The yield of receptor protein (∼20 ng in total from a typical preparation) was too low to permit analysis of the purity of the samples by protein staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Instead, sample purity was judged by AFM analysis of the protein particles, as described below. The P2X2 receptor preparation was adsorbed to a mica support, dried, and subjected to AFM imaging in air. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the receptor population appeared as a homogenous spread of particles. In contrast, when the standard receptor isolation procedure was applied to cells that had been mock-transfected, the resulting samples contained only 3% of the number of particles present in receptor samples, and these particles were of various sizes (data not shown). These findings indicate that the receptor samples contained very few contaminants. The heights and radii of a number of receptor particles were determined as indicated in Fig. 2, C and D. Particle radius was measured at half the maximal height to compensate for the tendency of AFM to overestimate this parameter because of the geometry of the tip (10Schneider S.W. Lärmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Lärmer J. Schneider S.W. Danker T. Schwab A. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A typical particle had a height of 2.6 nm and a radius of 9.9 nm. These values indicate a flattening of the particle, possibly caused by its drying down on the mica and/or a degree of “squashing” by the AFM tip, as observed previously (16Neish C.S. Martin I.L. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1943-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Particle dimensions were used to calculate molecular volumes using Equation 1. The frequency distribution of the calculated molecular volumes, based on two separate receptor preparations, is shown in Fig. 2E. The histogram was fitted to a Gaussian function using non-linear regression. No differences between peak and mean values were obtained (p > 0.05). The mean value of the molecular volume was 409 ± 18 nm3 (n = 91). As shown above (Fig. 1), the molecular mass of the P2X2 receptor subunit is 70 kDa. Of this, 55 kDa is core protein, and 15 kDa is attached oligosaccharide (13Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The expected molecular volume for a trimeric receptor of molecular mass 210 kDa may be estimated using Equation 2. According to this equation, the volumes of the core protein and the attached oligosaccharides should be 313 and 76 nm3, respectively, giving a total volume of 389 nm3. An additional complicating factor is the likely presence of detergent bound to the TMRs of the isolated receptor. AFM imaging has been used previously to study the structure of the GABAA receptor (9Neish C.S. Martin I.L. Davies M. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Nanotechnology. 2003; 14: 864-872Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which is known to be a pentamer. When this receptor was expressed exogenously in tsA 201 cells and imaged by AFM, a mean molecular volume of 769 nm3 was obtained. The expected value, on the basis of a total molecular mass of ∼260 kDa (of which about 10% is contributed by attached oligosaccharides), is 489 nm3. It was suggested that the considerable discrepancy between these two values was caused by the presence of detergent (9Neish C.S. Martin I.L. Davies M. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Nanotechnology. 2003; 14: 864-872Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Since each subunit of the GABAA receptor spans the membrane four times, the entire pentameric receptor would contain 20 TMRs. If the additional molecular volume (280 nm3) were a consequence of detergent binding, this would amount to about 14 nm3/TMR. A P2X2 receptor trimer would have only six TMRs so that the expected additional molecular volume in this case would be about 84 nm3, which would raise the predicted total molecular volume from 389 to 473 nm3. Given the various assumptions required to produce this value, it is clear that it should be regarded only as an estimate. Nevertheless, the molecular volume determined by AFM imaging (409 nm3) is close to that expected of a receptor trimer (473 nm3). In further experiments, the receptor was imaged following incubation with a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognized the N-terminal His6 tag. Images of the receptor alone and the antibody (IgG, molecular mass 150 kDa) alone are shown in Fig. 3A (top left and right panels, respectively). As can be seen, both the receptor and the antibody appeared as homogenous populations of particles, and the antibodies were clearly smaller than the receptor particles. When the suspension resulting from the receptor-antibody co-incubation was imaged, various structures were seen, including large and small particles, representing receptors and antibodies (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). Some of the large particles had one (arrows), two (arrowheads), or occasionally three (not shown) smaller particles attached. These structures are likely to be receptor particles that have been liganded by one, two, or three antibody molecules. In support of this interpretation, the molecular volumes of the large particles in the various liganding states (unliganded, 411 ± 13 nm3, n = 131; singly liganded, 396 ± 14 nm3, n = 96; doubly liganded, 446 ± 33 nm3, n = 42; and triply liganded, 402 ± 36 nm3, n = 16) are all similar to each other and also to the value determined for the receptor imaged without incubation with antibody (409 ± 18 nm3, above). The various structures in the images were analyzed, and their relative frequencies were determined. When the receptor was incubated with the anti-His6 antibody, of 472 receptor particles analyzed, 67.4% were unliganded; 20.3% had one antibody bound, and 8.9% had two bound antibodies (Table I). A very small proportion of the receptors (3.4%) had three bound antibodies. When receptors were imaged alone, only a small percentage of the receptors (3.2% of a total of 94) appeared to be associated with bound particles. These presumably represent structures that happened to attach to the mica alongside receptors. A similar number of receptors (2.7% of a total of 301) appeared to be singly liganded following incubation with a control monoclonal antibody (anti-Myc). These data indicate that the vast majority of the binding events observed with the anti-His6 antibody represent specific receptor-antibody interactions.Table IAntibody tagging profile of the P2X2 receptorNumber of particles bound to receptorReceptor alone%Receptor plus anti-His6 antibody%Receptor plus anti-Myc antibody%09196.831867.429297.0133.29620.382.7200428.910.3300163.400 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3B shows a gallery of images of receptors with zero, one, and two bound antibodies. In the case of doubly liganded receptors, the angles between the pairs of bound antibodies are also shown. These angles were calculated for each complex by joining the height peaks of the antibody particles to the height peak of the receptor particle. The angles between the pairs of antibodies were determined and used to construct the frequency distribution shown in Fig. 3C. The mean of the distribution is 123 ± 3° (n = 42), very close to the value of 120° predicted for a trimeric receptor. Fig. 4 summarizes our conclusions regarding the architecture of the P2X2 receptor, based on the data presented above. The individual receptor subunits span the membrane twice (Refs. 1Khakh B.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar and 2North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). These subunits are arranged as trimers to produce the complete receptor (Fig. 4B). According to this receptor architecture, two antibodies against the His6 tags added to the subunits should bind to the receptor with an angle of 120° between them. AFM images of doubly liganded receptors confirm this arrangement (Fig. 4C). When the P2X6 receptor is expressed exogenously in cells such as Xenopus oocytes or cultured olfactory bulb neurons, only a very small minority of the receptor is delivered to the cell surface (7Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the majority of the P2X6 receptor resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that it is being retained by the “quality control” machinery of the cell. One possible reason for this retention is that the receptor is not being correctly assembled, perhaps because the P2X6 receptor subunits are unable to oligomerize. To test this possibility, we first subjected crude extracts of transfected NRK cells to treatment with the cross-linker DSS. As shown in Fig. 5A, untreated receptor migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a major band of molecular mass 52 kDa and a minor band of molecular mass 45 kDa. These sizes are consistent with the existence of the receptor in glycosylated and unglycosylated forms (7Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To confirm this interpretation, a denatured cell extract was incubated with N-glycanase F, which should remove all N-linked oligosaccharides from the receptor. As expected, this treatment caused the two receptor bands to collapse into one band of approximate molecular mass 45 kDa (Fig. 5B). When the cell extract was treated with DSS, the two bands corresponding to the monomeric form of the receptor remained, and no clear higher order adducts were produced (Fig. 5C). Instead, there was a “smear” migrating between molecular masses 80–150 kDa, suggesting that the receptor had been cross-linked to a variety of neighboring proteins. The cross-linking data suggest that the P2X6 receptor, unlike the P2X2 receptor, does not form homo-trimers within the cells. To examine this possibility directly, the His6-tagged receptor was isolated from CHAPS extracts of membrane fractions through its ability to bind to Ni2+-agarose and imaged by AFM. Typical images of the isolated P2X6 receptor attached to mica, at two different magnifications, are shown in Fig. 6, A and C. Images of the P2X2 receptor, at these same magnifications, are also shown for purposes of comparison (Fig. 6, B and D). Simple inspection of these images reveals that the P2X6 receptors are, on average, considerably smaller than the P2X2 receptors. Measurement of the heights and radii enabled the calculation of the molecular volumes of the particles, using Equation 1. A typical particle had a height of 1.6 nm and a half-height radius of 7.6 nm. A frequency distribution of the calculated molecular volumes is shown in Fig. 6E, with the distribution for the P2X2 receptor for comparison. As for the P2X2 receptor, the histogram for the P2X6 receptor was fitted to a Gaussian function using non-linear regression. Again, no differences between peak and mean values were obtained (p > 0.05). The mean of the distribution is 145 ± 7 nm3 (n = 117). The predicted value for a P2X6 subunit of molecular mass 52 kDa, calculated using Equation 2 and taking into account the contributions of core protein and attached oligosaccharides, is 97 nm3. Detergent binding, to the extent of 14 nm3/TMR (above), would increase the predicted molecular volume of a monomer to 125 nm3, close to the measured value. These results indicate that the P2X6 receptor subunits do not form stable oligomers. The results of our chemical cross-linking experiments are consistent with those reported previously (6Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 7Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and strongly suggest that the membrane-associated P2X2 receptor is a trimer. It is clear from previous reports, however, that this indirect method for studying receptor structure has the potential to generate confusing results. We therefore sought a more direct method for examining receptor architecture. AFM permits the visualization of single isolated proteins and the measurement of their molecular dimensions (9Neish C.S. Martin I.L. Davies M. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Nanotechnology. 2003; 14: 864-872Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Schneider S.W. Lärmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26966-26970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A comparison of the molecular volume of individual receptors determined in this way with the volume expected for a particular molecular mass provides information about the subunit stoichiometry of the receptor. Schneider et al. (10Schneider S.W. Lärmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) have shown a very good correlation between predicted and calculated molecular volumes, over a range of protein molecular masses from 38 to 900 kDa. In the current study, the molecular volume of the P2X2 receptor determined in this study (409 nm3) was close to the value predicted using the assumption that the receptor is a trimer of 70-kDa subunits (473 nm3). There was considerable variation in the calculated molecular volume for the P2X2 receptor. There are likely to be several sources of this variation. First, it is unlikely that the receptor is completely pure, and any impurities will of course have various molecular volumes. Second, the receptor will probably attach to the mica surface in a range of orientations. This will lead to aberrations in the calculation of molecular volume, which is based on the assumption that the receptor has the shape of a spherical cap. Third, there may be differences in the amount of detergent remaining attached to the various receptor particles. However, despite these sources of variation, the standard error on the calculated molecular volume (<5%) is relatively small. For reasons described above, it is probably unwise to rely exclusively on molecular volume calculations to determine receptor architecture. Fortunately, AFM imaging provides a second means of examining receptor structure, based on antibody decoration of tags placed on individual subunits. We have applied this method previously in our study of the GABAA receptor (9Neish C.S. Martin I.L. Davies M. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Nanotechnology. 2003; 14: 864-872Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The predominant form of this receptor in the brain contains α1-, β2-, and γ2-subunits (21McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), probably in the stoichiometry of 2α:2β:1γ (22Farrar S.J. Whiting P.J. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10100-10104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We set out to determine whether the two α1-subunits known to be present within the GABAA receptor pentamer were adjacent or separated by another subunit. To address this question, we placed His6 tags on the α1-subunits, isolated the tagged receptor, and incubated it with anti-His6 antibodies. When we imaged the receptor-antibody complexes bound to mica, we found a number of receptors that had been decorated with two antibodies. The mean angle between the antibodies was 135°, close to the value of 144° expected if the α-subunits were separated by another subunit, rather than the 72° expected for adjacent α-subunits (9Neish C.S. Martin I.L. Davies M. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Nanotechnology. 2003; 14: 864-872Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified receptors that had been decorated with two anti-His6 antibodies. The mean angle between the antibodies was 123°, very close to the 120° expected for a trimeric receptor. The method used relies on the receptor-antibody complexes attaching to the mica in a manner that reflects the orientation of the antibodies in solution (i.e. falling flat so that the receptor and the two antibodies are all resting on the mica). Further, if the attachment formed between the receptor and the antibodies has some degree of flexibility, then one would expect this to be reflected in a variation in the angles measured. As expected from these considerations, there was indeed some variation in the values of angles calculated (between 80 and 170°), which is reflected in the images shown in Fig. 3B. Nevertheless, the standard error of the distribution of angles was small (∼2% of the mean), indicating that these problems are not significant. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, P2X6 receptors fail to reach the cell surface and instead remain in the core glycosylated form, consistent with their retention in the ER (7Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A similar behavior is seen in olfactory bulb neurons, where exogenously expressed P2X6 receptors co-localize with the ER marker calreticulin (17Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected HEK 293 cells do express some P2X6 receptors at their cell surface (23Chaumont S. Jiang L.-H. Penna A. North R.A. Rassendren F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29628-29638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These receptors are typically non-functional, although there has been a report of functional activity in a small minority of stably transfected HEK 293 cell clones (24Jones C.A. Vial C. Sellers L.A. Humphrey P.P.A. Evans R.J. Chessell I.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ER localization of receptors normally indicates incorrect assembly and retention by the ER quality control system. In the case of the cells expressing functional P2X6 receptors at the cell surface, it was suggested that additional proteins might be assisting in the correct assembly of the receptors (24Jones C.A. Vial C. Sellers L.A. Humphrey P.P.A. Evans R.J. Chessell I.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that P2X6 receptor subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes behave as tetramers and large aggregates on native gels (7Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been shown that co-expression of FLAG-tagged and HA-tagged P2X6 receptor subunits in HEK 293 cells did not result in co-immunoprecipitation, unlike the results obtained for all the other P2X receptor subunits (25Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This latter result suggests that all subunits except P2X6 are able to form stable homo-oligomers. To directly assess the oligomerization state of P2X6 receptors in tsA 201 cells, we determined the molecular volume of isolated receptors and compared it with the value expected on the basis of the subunit molecular mass. P2X6 receptor subunits imaged on mica were obviously smaller than P2X2 receptors, and the measured molecular volume (145 nm3) was close to the value expected for a single subunit with bound detergent (125 nm3). We conclude, therefore, that the P2X6 receptor is unable to form stable oligomers and propose that this failure to assemble is indeed the reason why the receptor does not traffic efficiently to the cell surface in Xenopus oocytes or HEK 293 cells. There remains the possibility that our choice of detergent with which to solubilize the receptor (CHAPS) was inappropriate and that oligomers would have been seen if another detergent had been used. The behavior of P2X receptors has, in fact, been found previously to be detergent-dependent (6Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), although differentially epitope-tagged P2X2 receptor subunits could be co-immunoprecipitated after solubilization in various detergents (25Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Further, the fact that the P2X2 receptor behaves as trimer in CHAPS indicates that this detergent is not having a deleterious effect on receptor assembly. We have demonstrated that AFM imaging can be used successfully to provide important information about the architecture of two types of ionotropic receptor (the P2X receptor and the GABAA receptor (9Neish C.S. Martin I.L. Davies M. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Nanotechnology. 2003; 14: 864-872Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar)). We anticipate that further progress can now be made using this approach. For instance, it ought to be possible to determine the subunit stoichiometry and architecture of other homomeric P2X receptors and of heteromeric P2X receptors. We also plan to apply the same techniques to study the structures of other members of the ionotropic receptor superfamily."

Pim-1 kinase was originally identified in Maloney murine leukemia virus-induced T-cell lymphomas and is associated with multiple cellular functions such as proliferation, survival, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (Wang, Z., Bhattacharya, N., Weaver, M., Petersen, K., Meyer, M., Gapter, L., and Magnuson, N. S. (2001) J. Vet. Sci. 2, 167–179). The crystal structures of Pim-1 complexed with staurosporine and adenosine were determined. Although a typical two-domain serine/threonine protein kinase fold is observed, the inter-domain hinge region is unusual in both sequence and conformation; a two-residue insertion causes the hinge to bulge away from the ATP-binding pocket, and a proline residue in the hinge removes a conserved main chain hydrogen bond donor. Without this hydrogen bond, van der Waals interactions with the hinge serve to position the ligand. The hinge region of Pim-1 resembles that of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase more closely than it does other protein kinases. Although the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 also inhibits Pim-1, the structure of the LY294002·Pim-1 complex reveals a new binding mode that may be general for Ser/Thr kinases.

The Pim-1 oncogene was first identified as the preferred site for integration of the slow transforming Maloney murine leukemia virus in lymphoblastic T-cells (1.Wang Z. Bhattacharya N. Weaver M. Petersen K. Meyer M. Gapter L. Magnuson N.S. J. Vet. Sci. 2001; 2: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the oncogene potential of the Pim-1 gene comes from the study of transgenic mice in which overexpression of Pim-1 produces a low but spontaneous rate of tumor incidence (2.Domen J. van der Lugt N.M. Laird P.W. Saris C.J. Berns A. Leukemia. 1993; 7: S108-S112PubMed Google Scholar). These mice are highly susceptible to chemical carcinogens, x-ray radiation, and Maloney murine leukemia virus-induced lymphomagenesis. Pim-1 knock-out mice did not show any obvious phenotype, suggesting in vivo functional redundancy of this highly conserved oncogene (3.Domen J. van der Lugt N.M. Acton D. Laird P.W. Linders K.

The x-ray structure of Pim-1 was pursued, in part, to determine how an unusual sequence feature in the active site affects ligand binding. In protein kinases, one hydrogen bond between the ATP (N1 atom) and a protein main chain NH is highly conserved. In the Pim-1 sequence, however, a proline (Pro123) occupies this position, so the main chain amide nitrogen is not available to participate in a hydrogen bond. A proline at this position is extremely rare; in fact, no other kinases with known structure have a similarly placed proline. Thus, the hydrogen bond to N1 of ATP is not necessary for substrate binding or catalysis in these kinases, and other interactions are sufficient to correctly position ATP. Qian et al. (25.Qian K.C. Wang L. Hickey E.R. Studts J. Barringer K. Penge C. Kronkaitis A. Li J. White A. Mische S. Farmer B. J. Biol. Chem.

This work showed the mechanism by which Pim-1 is constitutively active and the manner in which an ATP analog is bound in the absence of the one of the main chain hydrogen bond donors. In our study, two kinase inhibitors, staurosporine and adenosine, both of which accept a hydrogen bond from this main chain NH in other kinase structures, were chosen for co-crystallization with Pim-1. The conformations of these ligands further elucidate the interactions needed for ligand positioning in the absence of a conserved hydrogen bond. In the course of determining the Pim-1 structure, similarities with the active site of PI3K were observed. The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, was also found to inhibit Pim-1; we determined this additional co-complex structure to better understand the mechanisms by which LY294002 inhibits protein kinases. Cloning and Expression of Pim-1—Full-length Pim-1 (residues Met 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PKA, cAMP-dependent kinase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate); CK2, casein kinase 2.–Lys313) was cloned in two parts by PCR from a human IMAGE Consortium clone (GenBank™ accession number GI 1845036) and from a human bone marrow cDNA library (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The pieces were fused by PCR and inserted into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the dual promoter vector pBEV1, encoding a protein with an N-terminal His6 tag and thrombin cleavage site (26.Chambers S.P. Austen D.A. Fulghum J.R. Kim W.M. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 36: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this Pim-1 clone is identical to SwissProt entry P11309. BL21/DE3 pLysS Escherichia coli cells were transformed with the construct encoding full-length human Pim-1 kinase, using a standard transformation protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Freshly transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in brain heart infusion medium (DIFCO Laboratories, Detroit, MI) supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cells were grown at 37 °C up to an optical density of 0.75 at 600 nm, and expression was induced at 28 °C with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested via centrifugation 4 h post-induction and stored at –80 °C prior to purification. Protein Purification—Frozen cell pellets (∼30 g) were thawed in 7 volumes of Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 50 μm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 μg/ml E-64, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin (Roche Applied Science) and lysed in a microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA). The lysate was centrifuged at 54,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of Talon metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences, Clontech)/5 mg of protein overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 20 column volumes of Buffer A and eluted with Buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. Fractions containing Pim-1 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane in an Amicon stirred cell concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The Pim-1 fraction was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (90 × 2.6 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE, diluted to 25 mm NaCl with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and loaded onto a 8-ml prepacked MonoQ (HR 10/10) anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 20 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT). Pim-1 was eluted using a gradient of 0–40% Buffer D (buffer C plus 1 m NaCl) over 60 column volumes. Peak fractions were collected as four separate pools (I–IV) based on the elution chromatogram. The Pim-1 fraction was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (25 °C), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience, Hanover, Germany). The identity of the purified Pim-1 was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Typically, preparations contained a mixture of species with 0–5 phosphoryl groups, which were partially resolved by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1). Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that Pim-1 purified from E. coli was extensively phosphorylated in the His6 tag (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH), and the four MonoQ pools differed mainly in the degree of phosphorylation in this region. Dephosphorylation of Pim-1 with Lambda phosphatase (New England Biolabs) followed by autophosphorylation showed that Pim-1 readily autophosphorylates in the His6 tag region (data not shown). Ser261 was the major phosphorylation site observed in Pools III and IV. Other minor sites, Ser8, Thr23, and Ser98, were phosphorylated to varying degrees in each pool. Pim-1 crystallized from different MonoQ pools yielded similar crystal forms. The phosphorylation state of each of the MonoQ-purified pools I-IV of Pim-1 was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry of thrombin-cleaved Pim-1. Spectra were collected using a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) (27.Fox T. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Hsiao H.M. Brummel C.L. Su M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation sites were identified from tryptic digests of the MonoQ-purified pools I–IV to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on a QSTAR Pulsar quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (AB/MDS-Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Protana, Odese, Denmark).

The assay was carried out in a total volume of 100 μl in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.6, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 30 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Applied Science), and 2 mm DTT in a 96-well plate and read at 340 nm at 30 °C on a Spectramax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Pim-1 concentration was 25 nm in all assays. The reaction was started by the addition of ATP after 10 min of preincubation of the reaction mixture at 30 °C. Substrate concentrations were 1 mm S6 peptide, 2 mm ATP for activity assays and 40 μm S6 peptide, 100 μm ATP for IC50 determinations. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the reaction to 2.5% Me2SO final at the beginning of preincubation period. Kinetic analysis was performed by nonlinear regression fitting using the program Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) (Table I).Table IIC50 values of kinase inhibitors determined for Pim-1 Open table in a new tab Crystallization and X-ray Analysis—Pim-1 crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion method at 22 °C. Equal volumes of protein (12 mg/ml protein, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT) and well solution (1 m (NH4)2HPO4, 100 mm citrate buffer pH 5.5, 200 mm NaCl) were mixed and suspended over 1 ml of well solution. Over 4 days, the crystals reached a final size of ∼250 × 40 × 40 μm. Crystals were harvested and flash-frozen in a solution composed of the well solution with 30% (v/v) glycerol. A complex of Pim-1 with either staurosporine (Sigma-Aldrich) or the inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was made by soaking unliganded crystals (grown as above) with 500 μm compound and 5% Me2SO (final concentration) for 24 h at room temperature. The adenosine·Pim-1 complex was made by adding adenosine (2 mm) to the protein prior to crystallization. For the staurosporine and LY294002 complexes, x-ray diffraction data were recorded using a RU-200 x-ray generator and RaxisV++ detector (Rigaku, The Woodlands, TX), and the intensities were integrated and scaled using CrystalClear (29.CrystalClearAn Integrated Program for the Collection and Processing of Area Detector Data. Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX1997–2002Google Scholar). Diffraction data for the adenosine complex crystals were recorded at Beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, Berkeley, CA). The intensities were integrated and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (30.Otwinoski Z. L. Sawyer N.W.I. Bailey S. Oscillation Data Reduction Program: Data Collection and Processing.

Although full-length protein was used for crystallization (313 residues), 32 residues at the N terminus, 8 residues at the C terminus, and 4 residues in one loop (80–83) were not sufficiently ordered to be built into the electron density. Phosphorylation of Ser261 is clearly visible in the electron density map. The phosphoserine side chain participates in both intra- and intermolecular interactions and may be important in formation of the crystal packing interactions. Also, the electron density map reveals additional density adjacent to the sulfur of Cys161, indicating an adduct at this residue. The electron density was large enough to accommodate four nonhydrogen atoms; it was modeled as a β-mercaptoethanol adduct; however, it is also consistent with a partially ordered DTT adduct. Both DTT and β-mercaptoethanol were used in the purification. Enzymatic Activity—Kinase activity assays of the MonoQ pools I–IV were performed to determine whether the observed phosphorylation affected the catalytic activity. All four pools showed very similar kinetic parameters (kcat = 4 ± 0.4 s–1, peptide Km = 51 ± 2 μm, and ATP Km = 120 ± 16 μm). Pim-1 purified from E. coli was phosphorylated at Ser261 as well as multiple sites in the His tag region. Palaty et al. (36.Palaty C.K. Kalmar G. Tai G. Oh S. Amankawa L. Affolter M. Aebersold R. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10514-10521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have identified Ser190 in Xenopus Pim-3 as the major autophosphorylation site and showed that S190A and S190E mutants are 7-fold less active than the wild type Pim-3. The equivalent residue in human Pim-1, Ser189, was not phosphorylated in the E. coli purified preparations. The fact that all four MonoQ Pim-1 pools exhibit very similar kinetic parameters indicates that the enzyme is constitutively active and that the phosphorylation state does not affect enzymatic activity. The specific activity (5 ± 0.2 μmol/min/mg) observed here is much higher than previously reported (21.Friedmann M. Nissen M.S. Hoover D.S. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36.Palaty C.K. Kalmar G. Tai G. Oh S. Amankawa L. Affolter M. Aebersold R. Pelech S.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is 60-fold greater than that reported by Friedman et al. (21.Friedmann M. Nissen M.S. Hoover D.S. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) for human GST-Pim-1 using a histone H1 peptide (KRRASGP) and over 104-fold greater than that reported by Palaty et al. (38.Palaty C.K. Clark-Lewis I. Leung D. Pelech S.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for GST fusions of human Pim-1 using S6 peptide (AKRRRLSSLRA). Because both studies utilized GST fusions for expression and purification, it is possible that this large protein tag had a detrimental effect on enzyme activity, either by interfering with substrate access to the active site or with overall protein folding. A panel of kinase inhibitors was evaluated for their ability to inhibit Pim-1. Staurosporine and structurally similar compounds, such as K-252a and bisindolyl-maleimides I and IX, were found to inhibit Pim-1 with submicromolar potency (Table I). These compounds are nonspecific inhibitors of Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases (39.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, LY294002 was found to be an inhibitor of Pim-1 with IC50 = 4 μm. This compound was originally described as a specific inhibitor of PI3K with 1.4 μm IC50 (40.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, Davies et al. (39.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar) reported that LY294002 inhibits PI3K and casein kinase 2 with a similar potency (10 and 6.9 μm, respectively). Protein Structure—The structure of Pim-1 has a global fold typical of protein serine/threonine kinases, consisting of two domains linked by a hinge region (Fig. 2). The smaller, N-terminal domain (residues 33–121) consists primarily of β-strands with one α-helix, and the C-terminal domain (residues 128–305) is largely α-helical. The active site is formed by a groove at the interface between these two domains and is enclosed by the hinge region (residues 122–127), the glycine rich loop (residues 44–52), and the activation loop (residues 186–210). The Pim-1 structure was compared with several other protein kinases with high sequence homology such as cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) and phosphorylase kinase. When secondary structural elements are aligned, a root mean square deviation of 1.3 Å for C-α atom positions is observed between Pim-1 and both PKA or phosphorylase kinase (using 213 residues from phosphorylase kinase (Protein Data Bank code 1PHK) (31.Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and 220 residues from cAMP-dependent kinase (Protein Data Bank code 1ATP) (41.Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), respectively). The Pim-1 protein structures described here are similar to unliganded Pim-1 (25.Qian K.C. Wang L. Hickey E.R. Studts J. Barringer K. Penge C. Kronkaitis A. Li J. White A. Mische S. Farmer B. J. Biol. Chem. November 3, 2004; 280: 6130-6137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), with a root mean square deviation of 0.4 Å for C-α atoms. The conformation of the glycine-rich loop (residues 45–52) in this structure differs from that of the PKA structures and most closely resembles that of unliganded Pim-1 (25.Qian K.C. Wang L. Hickey E.R. Studts J. Barringer K. Penge C. Kronkaitis A. Li J. White A. Mische S. Farmer B. J. Biol. Chem. November 3, 2004; 280: 6130-6137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The Pim-1 glycine-rich loop moves toward the C-terminal domain, and Phe49 adopts a rotamer in which the side chain points toward the hinge region, thereby filling the space usually occupied by ATP phosphates (Fig. 2). In the Pim-1·AMP-PNP complex structure, the ligand phosphates displace Phe49, and the loop adopts a more open conformation. This is similar to GSK-3β, for instance, where the corresponding phenylalanine residue is observed both within the active site pointing toward the hinge (peptide complex) (42.Bax B. Carter P.S. Lewis C. Guy A.R. Bridges A. Tanner R. Pettman G. Mannix C. Culbert A.A. Brown M.J. Smith D.G. Reith A.D. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and, in another structure (unliganded), outside the active site, pointing away from the hinge (43.ter Haar E. Coll J.T. Austen D.A. Hsiao H.M. Swenson L. Jain J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The Pim-1 hinge sequence is unusual because of a two-residue insertion relative to kinases such as CDK-2 (44.De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and JNK-3 (45.Xie X. Gu Y. Fox T. Coll J.T. Fleming M.A. Markland W. Caron P.R. Wilson K.P. Su M.S.

https://openalex.org/W1997961337,"While investigating the mechanism of action of the novel antitumor drug Aplidin, we have discovered a potent and novel cell-killing mechanism that involves the formation of Fas/CD95-driven scaffolds in membrane raft clusters housing death receptors and apoptosis-related molecules. Fas, tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2/death receptor 5 were clustered into lipid rafts in leukemic Jurkat cells following Aplidin treatment, the presence of Fas being essential for apoptosis. Preformed membrane-bound Fas ligand (FasL) as well as downstream signaling molecules, including Fas-associated death domain-containing protein, procaspase-8, procaspase-10, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, and Bid, were also translocated into lipid rafts, connecting death receptor extrinsic and mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Blocking Fas/FasL interaction partially inhibited Aplidin-induced apoptosis. Aplidin was rapidly incorporated into membrane rafts, and drug uptake was inhibited by lipid raft disruption. Actin-linking proteins ezrin, moesin, RhoA, and RhoGDI were conveyed into Fas-enriched rafts in drug-treated leukemic cells. Disruption of lipid rafts and interference with actin cytoskeleton prevented Fas clustering and apoptosis. Thus, Aplidin-induced apoptosis involves Fas activation in both a FasL-independent way and, following Fas/FasL interaction, an autocrine way through the concentration of Fas, membrane-bound FasL, and signaling molecules in membrane rafts. These data indicate a major role of actin cytoskeleton in the formation of Fas caps and highlight the crucial role of the clusters of apoptotic signaling molecule-enriched rafts in apoptosis, acting as concentrators of death receptors and downstream signaling molecules and as the linchpin from which a potent death signal is launched.

CD95 or APO-1) (1Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis was questioned when FasL up-regulation, and even FasL itself, was found nonessential for Fas activation (2Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 3Mollinedo F. Gajate C. Wajant H. Fas Signaling. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2004: 1-15Google Scholar). Fas is a major member of the death receptor family, a subgroup of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily characterized by a cytoplasmic death domain that is responsible for the transmission of apoptotic signaling through interaction with death domain-bearing adaptor molecules (4Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Fas results in receptor oligomerization and recruitment of the adaptor molecule Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) through interaction between its own death domain and the clustered receptor death domains. In turn, FADD recruits procaspase-8 via a death effector domain interaction forming the so-called death-inducing signaling complex (5Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The close proximity of procaspase-8 molecules in the complex drives its activation by self-cleavage, triggering downstream effector caspases and leading to apoptosis (4Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). We have recently shown the translocation of Fas and downstream signaling molecules into clusters of lipid rafts in the killing of tumor cells, independently of FasL, by the antitumor ether lipid 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH3; Edelfosine) (6Gajate C. Mollinedo F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3860-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 7Gajate C. Del Canto-Janez E. Acuna A.U. Amat-Guerri F. Geijo E. Santos-Beneit A.M. Veldman R.J. Mollinedo F. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Fas association with membrane rafts has also been reported following its engagement by the ligand (8Scheel-Toellner D. Wang K. Singh R. Majeed S. Raza K. Curnow S.J. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 876-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Grassme H. Cremesti A. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5457-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and lipid rafts have been found to be essential for the initiation of Fas-mediated cell death signaling (6Gajate C. Mollinedo F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3860-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 7Gajate C. Del Canto-Janez E. Acuna A.U. Amat-Guerri F. Geijo E. Santos-Beneit A.M. Veldman R.J. Mollinedo F. J.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These data have led to the notion that Fas-mediated apoptosis is triggered by its recruitment and clustering in membrane rafts. Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids with an estimated size between 50–70 nm. The proteins located in these microdomains are severely limited in their ability to freely diffuse over the plasma membrane (11Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Thus, raft association tends to concentrate specific proteins within plasma membrane microdomains, and this could affect protein function (12Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5109) Google Scholar).Aplidin (Aplidine; dehydrodidemnin B) is a naturally occurring cyclic depsipeptide isolated from the Mediterranean tunicate Aplidium albicans that shows strong in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity (13Geldof A.A. Mastbergen S.C. Henrar R.E. Faircloth G.T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 44: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Aplidin behaves as the most potent and rapid apoptosis inducer ever described and as a promising drug in the treatment of leukemia (14Gajate C. An F. Mollinedo F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar). Its apoptotic action is mediated by Fas/FasL, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and mitochondria (14Gajate C. An F. Mollinedo F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cuadrado A. Gonzalez L. Suarez Y. Martinez T. Munoz A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we have found a potent and novel mechanism of cell killing mediated not only by the clustering of Fas but also by the concentration of additional death receptors and membrane-bound FasL, together with downstream signaling molecules, into aggregated lipid rafts through a cytoskeleton-mediated process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDrugs and Cell Culture—Aplidin was obtained from PharmaMar (Colmenar Viejo, Madrid, Spain) and prepared as a 1-mm stock solution dissolved in Me2SO. Final solvent concentrations in cell culture were less than 0.1% (v/v), which had no effect in any of the parameters studied. [14C]Aplidin (87.2 mCi/mmol) was from PharmaMar. The human acute T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 24 μg/ml gentamicin. Fas-deficient Jurkat cells were generated following protracted cultures (over 10 months) of parental Jurkat cells. Mouse fibroblasts L929 and Fas-transfected L929 cells (7Gajate C. Del Canto-Janez E.

Med. 2004; 200: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-10% fetal calf serum.Immunofluorescence Flow Cytometry—Cell surface expression of death receptors was analyzed by immunofluorescence flow cytometry (16Gajate C. Fonteriz R.I. Cabaner C. Alvarez-Noves G. Alvarez-Rodriguez Y. Modolell M. Mollinedo F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer, using anti-Fas SM1/1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) and specific antibodies against TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) and TRAIL-receptor 2/death receptor 5 (DR5) (Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). P3X63 myeloma culture supernatant, provided by F. Sánchez-Madrid (Hospital de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain), was used as a negative control. Measurement of FasL levels was achieved by flow cytometry in permeabilized cells as previously described (16Gajate C. Fonteriz R.I. Cabaner C. Alvarez-Noves G. Alvarez-Rodriguez Y. Modolell M. Mollinedo F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Aplidin Uptake—Drug uptake was measured after incubating 1 × 106/ml cells in fetal calf serum containing culture medium with 10–100 nm [14C]Aplidin for the indicated times and subsequent exhaustive washing (five times) with 2% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline, followed by radioactivity counting in the cell pellet.Apoptosis Assay—Quantitation of apoptotic cells was calculated by flow cytometry as the percentage of cells with a DNA content less than G1 (hypodiploidy) in cell cycle analysis (16Gajate C. Fonteriz R.I. Cabaner C. Alvarez-Noves G. Alvarez-Rodriguez Y. Modolell M. Mollinedo F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Death receptor-mediated apoptosis was induced with rhTNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or rhFasL (Alexis), active in human and murine systems, rhTNFα (Alexis), murine TNFα (provided by M. Modolell, Max-Planck-Institut für Immunbiologie, Freiburg, Germany), and cytotoxic anti-Fas CH-11 mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) as previously described (7Gajate C. Del Canto-Janez E. Acuna A.U. Amat-Guerri F. Geijo E. Santos-Beneit A.M. Veldman R.J. Mollinedo F. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The implication of Fas/FasL interaction in Aplidin-induced apoptosis was evaluated by using the blocking anti-Fas SM1/23 mAb (Bender MedSystems) as described previously (14Gajate C. An F. Mollinedo F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar).Confocal Microscopy—Cells were settled onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scan confocal microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) for membrane raft and protein visualization as described (6Gajate C. Mollinedo F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3860-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Colocalization assays were analyzed by excitation of the corresponding fluorochromes in the same section. Negative controls, lacking the primary antibody or using an irrelevant antibody, showed no staining.Lipid Raft Isolation and Western Blotting—Lipid rafts were isolated from 7 × 107 cells by lysis conditions for 30 min on ice in 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer and centrifugation on discontinuous sucrose gradients as previously reported (6Gajate C. Mollinedo F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3860-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and 20 μl of the individual fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). The location of ganglioside GM1-containing lipid rafts was determined using cholera toxin B subunit (CTx) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) as described previously (17Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Proteins were identified using the following specific antibodies: anti-48-kDa Fas (C-20), anti-46-kDa JNK1 (C-17), and anti-30-kDa RhoGDI (K-21) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, anti-23-kDa Bid (N-19) and anti-45-kDa DR5 (N-19) goat polyclonal antibodies, and anti-21-kDa RhoA mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-29-kDa FADD (clone-1), anti-80-kDa ezrin (clone-18), and anti-78-kDa moesin mAbs (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); anti-60-kDa TNF-R1 (H398) mAb (Alexis Biochemicals); anti-45-kDa DR5 (Ab-1) rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-55-kDa procaspase-8 (Ab-3) and anti-58-kDa procaspase-10 (Ab-2) mAbs (Oncogene Research Products). Anti-human FasL (NOK-1) mAb that recognized both 40-kDa membrane-bound FasL and 26-kDa soluble FasL was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-human CD45 (clone HI30) mAb that reacts with the 180-, 190-, 205-, and 220-kDa isoforms of the leukocyte common antigen present on all human leukocytes was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Prestained protein molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad) were run in parallel.Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation—Biotinylation of cell surface proteins from untreated and Aplidin-treated Jurkat cells was carried out by exhaustive cell washing with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by addition of 0.5 mg of the membrane-impermeable reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (Pierce) to 2.5 × 107 cells in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and submitted to lipid raft isolation as above. Lipid raft-enriched fractions (fractions 3–5) were pooled and precleared with protein A-Sepharose and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-FasL (NOK-1) mAb or X63 myeloma supernatant, used as a negative control, coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Sepharose beads were pelleted, washed five times, and submitted to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and visualization of biotinylated proteins was performed by ECL.RESULTSFas Involvement in Aplidin-induced Apoptosis—We have previously found that L929 cells, lacking Fas, were resistant to Aplidin but became sensitive after being stably transfected with human Fas cDNA (14Gajate C. An F. Mollinedo F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar). Both L929 and Fas-transfected L929 cells possessed functional receptors for TRAIL and TNFα (>90 and 74% apoptosis after incubation for 24 h with 50 ng/ml TRAIL and 100 units/ml TNFα, respectively, in the presence of 500 ng/ml actinomycin D). We then asked for the reverse approach, that is whether a Fas-positive cancer cell sensitive to Aplidin could become drug-resistant upon Fas loss. Toward this goal we generated a Fas-deficient subline from human T-lymphoid leukemia Jurkat cells, which are over 85% Fas-positive and very sensitive to Aplidin (Fig. 1). The cell surface expression of additional death receptors, such as TNF-R1 and TRAIL-receptor 2/DR5, remained at similar levels in both parental and Fas-deficient Jurkat cells (∼40 and 63% positive cells for TNF-R1 and DR5, respectively). Both cell types were equally sensitive to apoptosis after incubation with rhTNFα and rhTRAIL (>42% apoptosis after 24 h of incubation), indicating that TNF-R1 and DR5 receptors were functional. However, unlike parental Jurkat cells, Fas-deficient Jurkat cells (<1% Fas-positive cells) were resistant to Aplidin as well as to the agonistic cytotoxic CH-11 anti-Fas monoclonal antibody or rhFasL (Fig. 1). The antitumor drug ET-18-OCH3, which triggers Fas-mediated apoptosis (6Gajate C. Mollinedo F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3860-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 7Gajate C. Del Canto-Janez E.

Med. 2004; 200: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), also failed to induce cell death in Fas-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 1). These data indicate a major role of Fas in Aplidin-induced apoptosis that cannot be replaced by DR5 or TNF-R1.Aplidin Induces Recruitment of Death Receptors and Downstream Signaling Molecules into Clusters of Membrane Rafts—We found Aplidin induced a rapid capping of lipid rafts (Fig. 2A) as assessed by the raft marker fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled cholera toxin B subunit (FITC-CTx) that binds ganglioside GM1 (18Schon A. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5019-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), mainly found in rafts (19Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). In addition, Fas cocapped with membrane rafts in Aplidin-treated Jurkat cells (Fig. 2B). Translocation of Fas into lipid rafts was further confirmed by isolation of membrane rafts in both untreated and Aplidin-treated Jurkat cells in sucrose gradients (Fig. 3A). Lipid rafts were isolated based on their insolubility in Triton X-100 lysis buffer at 4 °C and fractionated by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation (7Gajate C. Del Canto-Janez E. Acuna A.U. Amat-Guerri F. Geijo E. Santos-Beneit A.M. Veldman R.J. Mollinedo F. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). GM1-containing lipid rafts, at the upper part (fractions 3–5) of the sucrose gradient (Fig. 3A), were located using CTx conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (17Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also found that additional death receptors, DR5 and TNF-R1, were translocated into lipid rafts in Aplidin-treated cells (Fig. 3A). We found that Aplidin induced colocalization of DR5 and TNF-R1 with clusters of lipid rafts as assessed by confocal microscopy (data not shown). These data show for the first time the clustering of three major death receptors in lipid rafts and could explain the outstanding proapoptotic effect of Aplidin in cancer cells (14Gajate C. An F. Mollinedo F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Coclustering of membrane rafts and Fas in Aplidin-treated Jurkat cells.

A, untreated Jurkat cells (Control) and Jurkat cells treated with 10 nm Aplidin for 3 h were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 and fractionated by centrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. An equal volume of each collected fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE before analysis of the indicated proteins using specific antibodies. Procaspases 8 and 10 as well as active p18 caspase-8 and p23 caspase-10 cleavage forms are indicated. Location of GM1-containing rafts (fractions 3–5) was determined using CTx conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Representative blots of three separate experiments are shown. B, the cell surface proteins of Jurkat cells were biotinylated, and membrane rafts were isolated as above from untreated control cells as well as from cells treated with 10 nm Aplidin for 3 h. Fractions 3–5 were pooled and used as the membrane raft fraction. Then, equal amounts of protein (45 μg) from the raft-enriched fraction were immunoprecipitated with X63 myeloma supernatant, used as a negative control, or anti-FasL mAb. The molecular masses (kDa) of protein markers are indicated on the left. C, Jurkat cells were treated with 10 nm Aplidin for 3 h and then analyzed for membrane raft and FasL localization using FITC-CTx (green fluorescence) and anti-FasL mAb, followed by CY3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (red fluorescence), respectively.

Caspase-10 was activated at a higher level than caspase-8, although only a minor proportion of caspase-10 and caspase-8 cleavage forms remained in lipid rafts (Fig. 3A). The recruitment in membrane rafts of JNK and Bid, the latter reported to act as a bridge between Fas signaling and mitochondria (20Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar), may explain the dependence on both JNK and mitochondrial signaling of Aplidin-mediated apoptosis (14Gajate C. An F. Mollinedo F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cuadrado A. Gonzalez L. Suarez Y. Martinez T. Munoz A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).On the other hand, we found that the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 was excluded from the membrane raft-containing fractions in both untreated and Aplidin-treated cells (Fig. 3A). This is in agreement with previous reports showing CD45 exclusion from membrane rafts under a wide array of experimental conditions (21Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 22Giurisato E. McIntosh D.P. Tassi M. Gamberucci A. Benedetti A. J. Biol.

Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results indicate that Aplidin induces a reorganization of lipid raft protein content, translocating some proteins to these detergent-insoluble fractions, whereas others remain excluded from these fractions.Membrane-bound FasL Is Concentrated in Membrane Rafts following Aplidin Treatment—Because Fas was required for an effective Aplidin-induced apoptotic response we investigated whether its cognate ligand FasL was affected following drug treatment. Aplidin did not induce FasL synthesis before triggering of the apoptotic response (data not shown) as assessed by flow cytometry analysis of FasL expression in permeabilized cells. In addition, Aplidin-induced apoptosis is independent of protein biosynthesis (14Gajate C. An F. Mollinedo F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar), further supporting that FasL synthesis is not required for the apoptotic response induced by Aplidin. However, we found translocation of a FasL-immunoreactive band into membrane rafts following Aplidin treatment (Fig. 3A). This band corresponded to ∼40-kDa molecular mass, which is the expected size for membrane-bound FasL. We further confirmed the presence of membrane-bound FasL in membrane rafts isolated from Aplidin-treated Jurkat cells by biotinylation of cell surface proteins followed by treatment with Aplidin and subsequent immunoprecipitation of raft-enriched pooled fractions with a specific anti-FasL mAb (Fig. 3B). However, FasL was found to be virtually undetectable or in negligible amounts in membrane rafts isolated from biotinylated untreated control Jurkat cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, by confocal microscopy we found coclustering of membrane-bound FasL and lipid rafts in Aplidin-treated Jurkat cells (Fig. 3C). Untreated cells showed a very faint and diffuse staining for membrane-bound FasL (data not shown). FasL translocation to lipid rafts following treatment with 10 nm Aplidin showed a kinetics similar to that of Fas receptor (data not shown), being optimum after 3 h treatment. Prevention of Fas/FasL interaction by the blocking anti-Fas SM1/23 antibody partially inhibited Aplidininduced apoptosis (43.2% inhibition), confirming our previous findings (14Gajate C. An F. Mollinedo F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1535-1545PubMed Google Scholar) and suggesting that Aplidin induces cell death through both the Fas/FasL system and a FasL-independent process. This can be explained by our present data as Fas and membrane-bound FasL located in membrane rafts may interact with each other through adjacent cells exposing the same complementary set of Fas and FasL proteins concentrated in lipid rafts. In addition, recruitment of Fas and the subsequent downstream signaling molecules into lipid rafts can facilitate triggering of the apoptotic signal with no participation of FasL (3Mollinedo F. Gajate C. Wajant H. Fas Signaling. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2004: 1-15Google Scholar, 7Gajate C. Del Canto-Janez E. Acuna A.U. Amat-Guerri F. Geijo E. Santos-Beneit A.M. Veldman R.J.

Jurkat cells were pretreated with MCD at the indicated concentrations for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium and washed three times; 10 nm Aplidin was then added for 3 h. The percentage of apoptotic cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Control untreated cells and cells treated only with MCD were run in parallel.

Immunological and biochemical analyses indicated that IQGAP1 (molecular mass of ∼190 kDa) is expressed in SK-OV-3.ipl cells and that IQGAP1 interacts directly with Cdc42 in a GTP-dependent manner. Both IQGAP1 and Cdc42 were physically linked to CD44 in SK-OV-3.ipl cells following HA stimulation. Furthermore, the HA-CD44-induced Cdc42-IQGAP1 complex regulated cytoskeletal function via a close association with F-actin that led to ovarian tumor cell migration. In addition, the binding of HA to CD44 promoted the association of ERK2 with the IQGAP1 molecule, which stimulated both ERK2 phosphorylation and kinase activity. The activated ERK2 then increased the phosphorylation of both Elk-1 and estrogen receptor-α (ERα), resulting in Elk-1- and estrogen-responsive element-mediated transcriptional up-regulation. Down-regulation of IQGAP1 (by treating cells with IQGAP1-specific small interfering RNAs) not only blocked IQGAP1 association with CD44, Cdc42, F-actin, and ERK2 but also abrogated HA-CD44-induced cytoskeletal function, ERK2 signaling (e.g. ERK2 phosphorylation/activity, ERK2-mediated Elk-1/ERα phosphorylation, and Elk-1/ERα-specific transcriptional activation), and tumor cell migration. Taken together, these findings indicate that HA-CD44 interaction with IQGAP1 serves as a signal integrator by modulating Cdc42 cytoskeletal function, mediating Elk-1-specific transcriptional activation, and coordinating “cross-talk” between a membrane receptor (CD44) and a nuclear hormone receptor (ERα) signaling pathway during ovarian cancer progression.

A significant reduction in tumor implants has been found to occur in nude mice 5 weeks after intraperitoneal injection of ovarian cancer cells incubated with anti-CD44 antibody compared with injected cells pretreated with antibodies against other cell-surface proteins (8Cannistra S.A.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the ability of CD44-positive ovarian tumor cells to undergo cancer progression at HA-enriched extracellular matrix within the peritoneal cavity remain poorly understood. The binding of HA to CD44 isoforms triggers direct “cross-talk” between two different tyrosine kinase (e.g. p185HER2 tyrosine kinase (5Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H.B. Chu A. Zhang L. Hung M.C. J. Biol.

Recent studies have shown that HA-CD44 interaction in caveolin/cholesterol-enriched lipid raft microdomains plays an important role in promoting membrane-cytoskeleton association and stimulating several intracellular signaling pathways (e.g. Ca2+ mobilization, cellular pH changes, Rho signaling, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation), leading to the onset of cytoskeletal function and ovarian tumor cell-specific behaviors (e.g. cell survival, growth, migration, and invasion) (15Singleton P.A.

These findings clearly demonstrate that CD44 plays a pivotal role in activating oncogenic signaling, leading to ovarian tumor cell function. Members of the Rho subclass of the Ras superfamily (small molecular mass GTPases, e.g. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) are known to be associated with changes in the membrane-linked cytoskeleton (18Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5193) Google Scholar). For example, activation of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 has been found to produce specific structural changes in the plasma membrane-cytoskeleton associated with membrane ruffling, lamellipodia, filopodia, and stress fiber formation (18Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5193) Google Scholar). The rationale for our present focus on Rho GTPase-related signaling is based on previous reports suggesting that CD44-associated cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. ankyrin and ERM) and certain tumor cell-specific phenotypes are dependent on Rho GTPase activation (19Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S.

Furthermore, overexpression of Rho GTPases in human tumors often correlates with a poor cancer prognosis (22Fritz G. Just I. Kaina B. Int. J.

Cancer. 1998; 77: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Consequently, coordinated Rho GTPase signaling is considered to be a possible mechanism underlying cell growth and migration, both of which are obvious prerequisites for metastasis (24Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu D. Zhu H. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 6: 287-297Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the search for additional cellular targets of HA-CD44-activated Rho GTPases that correlate with metastatic behavior in ovarian tumor cells, a molecule identified as IQGAP1 (a 190-kDa protein, one of the downstream effectors of Cdc42) has been detected (26Weissbach L.

Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7453-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, IQGAP1-ERK2 association modulates the Ras/MAPK pathways (in particular, ERK signaling) (37Roy M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that IQGAP1 not only serves as a scaffolding protein (mediating multiprotein complex assembly), but also directly participates in cytoskeleton activation and signaling coordination. ERKs, members of the MAPK family, are known to be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors, and G-protein-coupled receptors (43Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). In particular, ERK phosphorylation of certain target proteins is directly involved in transcriptional activation by coordinating extracellular cues and intracellular signals (43Chen Z. Gibson T.B.

For example, during epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation or integrin signaling, ERK activation is coupled with the phosphorylation of specific target molecules, including transcription factors (e.g. the ternary complex factor Elk-1) (45Lenormand P.

Furthermore, growth factors have been found to activate ERK and to augment estradiol-mediated activation of nuclear hormone receptors/estrogen receptors during malignant transformation (47Bunone G.

Previous studies indicate that HA interaction with the hyaluronan receptor RHAMM regulates ERK activity (50Zhang S. Chang M.C.Y. Zylka D. Turley S. Harrison R. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11342-11348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Most importantly, HA-activated ERK signaling participates in the up-regulation of certain transcription factors (e.g. NF-κB and AP-1) (50Zhang S. Chang M.C.Y. Zylka D. Turley S. Harrison R.

Although ERK activation is closely associated with HA and RHAMM signaling, the regulatory mechanisms that modulate ERK-mediated transcriptional activation and cellular functions in HA-CD44-stimulated ovarian cancer progression are not well understood. In this study, we have described a new HA-CD44-mediated oncogenic mechanism occurring in ovarian tumor cells. Specifically, we have focused on CD44 interactions with IQGAP1 during HA signaling in SK-OV-3.ipl ovarian tumor cells. Our results indicate that HA-CD44-stimulated IQGAP1 binds to both Cdc42 and ERK (in particular, ERK2). These interactions enhance F-actin binding and promote ERK activation, leading to the phosphorylation of Elk-1 and estrogen receptor (ER)-α, Elk-1-specific transcriptional up-regulation, and estrogen-responsive element (ERE) reporter gene activation, as well as ovarian tumor cell migration. Down-regulation of IQGAP1 (by treating cells with IQGAP1-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)) effectively blocks HA-CD44-stimulated cytoskeletal function, ERK signaling, and ovarian tumor cell behaviors. These findings suggest that HA-CD44-activated IQGAP1 plays an essential role in regulating Cdc42-cytoskeleton interaction and in modulating ERK activity required for Elk-1 and nuclear hormone receptor (ERα) transcriptional up-regulation and ovarian cancer progression. Cell Culture—The SK-OV-3.ipl cell line was established from ascites that developed in a nu/nu mouse given an intraperitoneal injection of the SK-OV-3 human ovarian carcinoma cell line (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) as described previously (5Bourguignon L.Y.W.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were routinely serum-starved (and therefore deprived of serum HA) before adding HA. Antibodies and Reagents—Rat anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody (clone 020, isotype IgG2b; obtained from CMB-TECH, Inc., San Francisco, CA) recognizes a common determinant of the HA-binding region of CD44 isoforms, including CD44s, CD44E, and CD44 variant species. This rat anti-CD44 antibody was routinely used for HA-related blocking experiments. Both mouse anti-IQGAP1 and rabbit anti-phospho-ERα antibodies were purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY). A number of immunoreagents, including rabbit anti-Elk-1, mouse anti-phospho-Elk-1, and goat anti-actin antibodies, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Other immunoreagent such as mouse anti-Cdc42, rabbit anti-ERK, rabbit anti-ERK2, and rabbit anti-phospho-ERK antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences, Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA), and Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Mouse anti-ERα antibody and recombinant ERα were manufactured by Lab Vision Corp. (Freemont, CA) and Calbiochem, respectively. 17β-[3H]Estradiol (specific radioactivity of 52 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Water-soluble β-estradiol was obtained from Sigma. High molecular mass Healon HA polymers (∼500,000-Da polymers) were prepared by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S1000 column. The purity of the high molecular mass HA polymers used in our experiments was further verified by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. HA polymers were also digested by PH20 hyaluronidase. Both intact HA and PH20 hyaluronidase-treated HA fragments were used for analyzing their effects on biological activities as described under “Results.” Measurement of Cdc42 Activation—SK-OV-3.ipl cells (∼5.0 × 106 cells) were resuspended in buffer containing 118 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1.2 mm magnesium acetate, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. An aliquot of the cell suspension was added to the electroporation cuvette and incubated at 4 °C for 5-10 min, followed by the addition of [35S]GTPγS (12.5 μCi). Subsequently, cells were electroporated at 25 microfarads and 2.0 kV/cm, followed by incubation either with HA (50 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of rat anti-CD44 antibody (50 μg/ml) or with PH20 hyaluronidase-treated HA fragments (50 μg/ml) or without any HA treatment at 37 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, [35S]GTPγS-labeled cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and solubilized in 1.0% Nonidet P-40 with 1 mm GTP, 25 mm magnesium acetate, and protease inhibitors in PBS (pH 7.4). Nonidet P-40-solubilized cells were then incubated with mouse anti-Cdc42 IgG (5 μg/ml) plus goat anti-mouse antibody-conjugated beads. The amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to Cdc42 associated with anti-Cdc42 antibody-conjugated Immunobeads was measured using a γ-counter.

https://openalex.org/W2116081018,"The extracellular pH (pHe) of tumor tissues is often acidic, which can induce the expression of several proteins. We previously showed that production of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was induced by culturing cells at acidic pHe (5.4–6.5). Here we have investigated the signal transduction pathway by which acidic pHe induces MMP-9 expression. We found that acidic pHe (5.9) activated phospholipase D (PLD), and inhibition of PLD activity by 1-butanol and Myr-ARF6 suppressed the acidic pHe-induced MMP-9 expression. Exogenous PLD, but not phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC or PLA2, mimicked MMP-9 induction by acidic pHe. Western blot analysis revealed that acidic pHe increased the steady-state levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and p38 and that the PLD inhibitors suppressed these increases. Using 5′-deletion mutant constructs of the MMP-9 promoter, we found that the acidic pHe-responsive region was located at nucleotide –670 to –531, a region containing the NFκB binding site. A mutation into the NFκB binding site reduced, but not completely, the acidic pHe-induced MMP-9 promoter activity, and NFκB activity was induced by acidic pHe. Pharmacological inhibitors specific for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (PD098059) and p38 (SB203580) attenuated the acidic pHe-induced NFκB activity and MMP-9 expression. These data suggest that PLD, mitogen-activated protein kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and p38), and NFκB mediate the acidic pHe signaling to induce MMP-9 expression. A transcription factor(s) other than NFκB may also be involved in the MMP-9 expression."

https://openalex.org/W2116247944,"The Gαo/i-coupled CB1 cannabionoid receptor induces neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2A cells. The mechanisms of signaling through Gαo/i to induce neurite outgrowth were studied. The expression of Gαo/i reduces the stability of its direct interactor protein, Rap1GAPII, by targeting it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This results in the activation of Rap1. Gαo/i-induced activation of endogenous Rap1 in Neuro-2A cells is blocked by the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin. Gαo/i stimulates neurite outgrowth that is blocked by the expression of dominant negative Rap1. Expression of Rap1GAPII also blocks the Gαo/i-induced neurite outgrowth and treatment with proteasomal inhibitors potentiates this inhibition. The endogenous Gαo/i-coupled cannabinoid (CB1) receptor in Neuro-2A cells stimulates the degradation of Rap1GAPII; activation of Rap1 and treatment with pertussis toxin or lactacystin blocks these effects. The CB1 receptor-stimulated neurite outgrowth is blocked by treatment with pertussis toxin, small interfering RNA for Rap, lactacystin, and expression of Rap1GAPII. Thus, the Gαo/i-coupled cannabinoid receptor, by regulating the proteasomal degradation of Rap1GAPII, activates Rap1 to induce neurite outgrowth.

The differentiation process in neurons is a complex phenomenon involving multiple changes. These include both changes in electrophysiological characteristics as well changes in morphology characterized by dendritic and axonal outgrowths. A general term “neurite” is used to define these outgrowths which are morphological characteristics of the neuronal differentiation process. Regulation of neurite outgrowth is tightly controlled and many neurotransmitters are induced in this process. Neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons is regulated by D2 dopamine receptors (1Reinoso B.S. Undie A.S. Levitt P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Serotonin 1B receptors are known to enhance neurite outgrowth in thalamic neurons of rodents (2Lotto B. Upton L. Price D.J. Gaspar P. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 269: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Growth cones from rat cerebellar neurons are guided by the chemoattractant SDF-1, and Xenopus neuron outgrowth is guided by the GABA-B receptors (3Xiang Y. Li Y. Zhang Z. Cui K. Wang S. Yuan X.B. Wu C.P. Poo M.M. Duan S. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A common feature of all these receptors is that they couple through the Gαo/i pathway. It has been known for over a decade that Gαo/i can induce neurite outgrowth (4Strittmatter S.M. Fishman M.C. Zhu X.P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2327-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that Gαo/i is one of the more abundant proteins present in the neuronal growth cones (5Strittmatter S.M. Fishman M.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the Gαo/i signals are transduced have never been clarified. We and others (6Jordan J.D. Carey K.D.

The mechanisms by which Gαo activates Rap and the consequences of this activation are unknown. To determine both the biological consequences of activation of Gαo/Rap pathway and the mechanisms by which this occurs we searched for a cellular system where we could study the biochemical mechanisms within the context of the biological effects. Here we describe how the endogenous cannabinoid receptors in Neuro-2A cells use the Gαo/i pathway to induce neurite outgrowth. Cell Culture—COS-7 and HEK-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and Neuro-2A cells were maintained in 44% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 44% F12 media and 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into COS-7 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly 100,000 cells were plated per well in a 6-well plate, and 24 h later each well was transfected with 2 μg DNA and 6 μl of FuGENE. For HEK-293T cells, 2 × 106 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes and 24 h later transfected with 4 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (10 μl). For imaging experiments Neuro-2A cells (5 × 105) were plated in 35-mm Mattek® plates and were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000® the following day. Neuro-2A cells were obtained from ATCC (catalog number CCl-131). Coimmunoprecipitation—293T and COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), respectively. 293T cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection, and immunoprecipitations were done as described previously (6Jordan J.D. Carey K.D. Stork P.J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21507-21510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a Gαo-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GST Pull-downs—Human Rap1GAPI and Rap1GAPII were cloned by PCR from Jurkat cells and the N terminus of each was subcloned into the pGEX4T2 expression vector (Amersham Biosceinces). Bacterially expressed purified protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with 293T cell lysates expressing Gα subunits followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with Gαo or Gαi2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

The primers used were as follows: Rap1GAPII, 5′-ATTACTACTCACTGGACACTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCAAACTTGAAGTTATTGC-3′ (reverse); RGSZ1, 5′-ATGGCCTGTGAGGAGCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAGCTGTGCGTCATCGA-3′ (reverse); actin, 5′-CGGAACCGCTCATTGCC3′ (forward) and 3′-ACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′ (reverse). Each reaction contained a 1 μm concentration of each gene-specific primer, reaction mix, and 50 ng of total RNA. The annealing temperature was 55 °C and the extension time was 15 s. Data were analyzed using Lightcycler data analysis software. Crossing points were calculated using the second derivative maximum method. All reactions were done in triplicate and data for Rap1GAPII were normalized against actin RNA levels for each sample. Ubiquitination Assays—HA-tagged ubiquitin vectors were used to follow the ubiquitination of proteins. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids and 48 h later harvested in 100 μl of denaturing lysis buffer (1× TBS (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), 2% SDS) preheated to 95 °C. Lysates were heated at 95 °C for 10 min followed by the dilution in 900 μl of non-denaturing lysis buffer (1× TBS, 1% Triton X-100) and immediately placed on ice. Samples were sonicated for 15 s to reduce the viscosity, followed by preclearing with the addition of 50 μl of protein-G-agarose. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of M2-FLAG antibody overnight followed by the addition of 15 μl of protein-G-agarose for 4 h. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies—Antibodies specific for Rap1GAPI/II and Rap1GAPII were made by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyaninconjugated peptide specific for each protein (Sigma-Genosys). The sequence for the synthesized peptides for Rap1GAPI/II was N-CNPTARIYRKHFLGKEH-C and for Rap1GAPII was N-MAQLRPAVPPGRPRRGSLPA-C. Antibodies were affinity-purified on peptide-conjugated columns (Pierce). Rap Activation Assays—Levels of activated Rap were measured by use of the RalGDS binding domain as described by Carey and Stork (8Carey K.D. Stork P.J.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The RalGDS-RBD (RalGDS-Rap1 binding domain) assay was performed using bacterial expressed GST-RalGDS-RBD fusion protein pre-bound to glutathione beads to detect active GTP-bound form of Rap1. RalGDS-RBD domain was PCR cloned from Jurkat cDNA and ligated into the pGEX4T2 vector. RalGDS-RBD was expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria, extracted in bacterial lysis buffer containing DTT and protease inhibitors, and then incubated with glutathione beads. RalGDS-RBD-bound beads were incubated with total cell lysates in presence of DTT and protease inhibitor mixture for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, GTP-bound Rap1 was separated from beads by boiling the samples in loading buffer. The samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and subjected to immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-Rap1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Imaging—Six hours after transfection Neuro-2A cells were serumstarved for 18 h. To inhibit proteasomal activity, cells were incubated with 20 μm lactacystin (Sigma, catalog number L-6785) for 2 h prior to imaging. Living cells were imaged with a Zeiss 510 confocal laserscanning microscope. Multiple (3Xiang Y. Li Y. Zhang Z. Cui K. Wang S. Yuan X.B. Wu C.P. Poo M.M. Duan S. Nat.

Statistical validation of the image shown is included in the figure legend to Fig. 4. TIFF images were processed with Adobe Photoshop. Neurite Outgrowth Assays—Neuro-2A cells were plated in 6-well dishes. For dominant negative experiments, cells were cotransfected with dominant negative mutant of Rap1 or control bicistronic vector, IRES (Clontech BD Sciences) containing GFP or GFP-Gαo. For siRNA experiments, HPP-grade siRNA for Rap1 (DNA target sequence AAGCAAGTCGAGGTAGATTGC with dTdToverhangs) was synthesized by Qiagen. Cells were transfected with siRNA for Rap1 or control oligonucleotides for 4 h with Qiagen TransMessenger transfection reagent. Four hours after adding siRNA, cells were washed with 1× PBS and then transfected with bicistronic vector containing GFP or GFP-Gαo. Twenty-four hours posttransfection GFP-positive cells were counted for neurite outgrowth. The cells displaying neurite outgrowth were those that had cellular projections of length two times greater than the cell diameter. For each culture condition randomly chosen regions of the plate containing 100 cells were scored under a phase contrast microscope (Nikon TMS). All assays were done in triplicate and in two or three independent experiments, and the indicated values are represented as mean ± S.E. For studies examining the effect of antagonist, pertussis toxin, or lactacystin, ∼1-5 × 103 cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated with 15 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 16 h or with 20 mm lactacystin (proteasomal inhibitor) or 10 mm SR141716A (CB1 receptor antagonist) for 2 h followed by treatment with 10 μm HU-210 for 16 h. Neurite outgrowth was quantitated as described above. All assays were done in triplicate and data represented as mean ± S.E. Cannabinoid CB1 Receptor-induced Neurite Outgrowth in Neuro-2A Cells through Gαo/i and Rap—The mouse neuroblastoma cell Neuro-2A can be induced to differentiate with outgrowth of neurites under a variety of stimuli including retinoic acid, the ganglioside GM1, low serum (9Wu G. Fang Y. Lu Z-H. Leeden R.W. J. Neurocytol. 1998; 27: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), or inhibition of protein kinase C (10Minana M-D. Felipo V. Grisolia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4335-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We initially screened the Neuro-2A cells for endogenous Gαo/i-coupled receptors and found that these cells express the cannabinoid CB1 receptor. Treatment of serumstarved Neuro-2A cells with the CB1 receptor agonist HU-210 resulted in a significant increase in neurite outgrowth in a concentration dependent manner. Addition of the antagonist SR 141716A inhibited CB1 receptor agonist-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 1A). To establish that the CB1 receptor effects were due to coupling to a Gαo/i pathway we treated the cells with pertussis toxin, a blocker of signaling through this pathway, and tested for the effects of the CB1 receptor agonist. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin fully blocked the CB1 receptor-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 1B). Micrographs of control cells and cells with HU-210-induced neurites are shown in Fig. 1, C and D. Since the effect of pertussis toxin indicates that the Go/i pathway is involved, we tested whether transfection with Gαo induces neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2A cells. In addition, since Gαo/i activates Rap (6Jordan J.D. Carey K.D. Stork P.J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21507-21510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T. Kitabatake A. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Nature. 1999; 400: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we also tested whether the Gαo/i effect was blocked by dominant negative Rap (Rap1 DN). As shown in the experiment in Fig. 1E, Gαo induced neurite outgrowth, and this was blocked by cotransfection with Rap1-DN. Gαo/i Interacts with Rap1GAPII and Targets It for Degradation—Initially, we had cloned Rap1GAP from a chick dorsal root ganglion library that had been used for the yeast two-hybrid screen. Subsequently we cloned human Rap1GAP from Jurkat cells and found that there were two human isoforms of Rap1GAP which are splice variants. The second isoform (Rap1GAPII) has 6 additional amino acids (NTDLFE) at the N terminus after the initiation methionine. This N-terminal extension results in the appearance of a GoLoco motif that has been shown to be involved in interaction with Gα-subunits (11Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We determined the interactions between Rap1GAPI and -II and Gαo and Gαi2. For this, we transfected 293T cells with FLAG-tagged Rap1GAPI, Rap1GAPII, a N-terminal truncated version of Rap1GAP, and Gαo. The FLAG-M2 antibody was used to pull down the expressed RapGAP, and the immunoprecipitate was tested for the presence of Gαo subunits. Rap1GAPII preferentially bound Gαo subunits, and the WT Gαo protein appears to interact with Rap1GAPII more avidly than the activated form of Gαo (Fig. 2A) as would be expected due to the presence of the GoLoco motif (11Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We also immunoblotted the immunoprecipitates with a Gβ antibody to determine whether Rap1GAPII was able to interact with the heterotrimeric G protein complex but were not able to detect Gβ suggesting that the Gαo associated with Rap1GAPII is likely to be in a different pool from that which is associated with Gβγ (data not shown). Structural data also support this mutual exclusion, since the GoLoco motif binds to the same region of Gα subunits as Gβγ (11Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We also conducted GST pull-down experiments where GST-tagged RapGAP was purified, bound to glutathione-Sepharose, and used to isolate Gαo and Gαi (Fig. 2B). These experiments indicated that Gαo/i subunits do interact with Rap1GAPII. To determine whether the observed biochemical interactions also occur in live cells where the Gαo/Rap pathway might be operative, we investigated the effect of Gαo co-expression on CFP-tagged Rap1GAPs in Neuro-2A cells. By themselves, both CFP-Rap1GAP1 and CFP-Rap1GAPII showed diffuse cytosolic fluorescence with negatively imaged organelles (Fig. 2C, panels i and iii). Expression of Gαo led to the selective accumulation of CFP-tagged Rap1GAPII to perinuclear vesicles (please compare Fig. 2C, panel ii versus panel iv) indicating a functional effect of Gαo on Rap1GAPII. However, we were unable to detect any measurable FRET between YFP-tagged Gαo and CFP-tagged Rap1GAPII (data not shown). Gαo Degradation of Rap1GAPII Activates Rap and Induces Neurite Outgrowth—During our coexpression studies when we immunoblotted for both Gαo and Rap1GAPII we consistently found that expression of Gαo appeared to reduce the levels of Rap1GAPII proteins. We had found this to be true in both 293T cells and COS-7 cells. To explore the reasons for this we expressed Rap1GAPI, Rap1GAPII, and the N-terminal truncated RapGAP in control, WT Gαo, and activated Gαo expressing cells. We found that coexpression of Gαo and Rap1GAPII resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of Rap1GAPII (Fig. 3A). The decrease in levels of Rap1GAPII appears to be specific for members of the Gαo/i family, since coexpression of Gαs or Gαq did not affect the levels of Rap1GAPII (Fig. 3B). Under conditions where the Rap1GAPII protein levels were decreased, we did not find any changes in the Rap1GAPII mRNA levels as assayed by real-time PCR (Fig. 3C). Treatment of Rap1GAPII-expressing cells with inhibitors of various proteases indicated that the proteasomal inhibitors (MG-132, lactacystin, and PSI) blocked the disappearance of Rap1GAPII indicating that decrease in Rap1GAPII protein levels is due to proteasomal degradation (Fig. 3D). Such proteasomal degradation of RapGAP has been observed in thyroid cells (13Tsygankova O.M. Feshchenko E. Klein P.S. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5501-5507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since RapGAP may be ubiquitinated for targeting for proteasomal degradation, and since ubiquitination is often a regulated process, we determined if the Rap1GAPII ubiquitination was affected by Gαo. For this we expressed FLAG-tagged Rap1GAPPII and HA-tagged ubiquitin in the absence and presence of Gαo. The presence of Gαo increased the ubiquitination of Rap1GAPII (Fig. 3E). Although Rap1GAPII is ubiquitinated, the extent of ubiquitination appears to be far less than that of a well known ubiquitinated protein, Traf2 (Fig. 3F). Taken together these data indicate that Gαo promotes the ubiquitination of Rap1GAPII and thus targets it for proteasomal degradation. These experiments raised two questions: can the effect of Gαo be observed on native Rap1GAPII, and does the degradation of Rap1GAPII stimulate Rap activity? To address these issues we transfected Gαo into Neuro-2A cells and tested for its effects on the levels of Rap1GAPII and on the activation state of Rap in the presence and absence of proteasomal inhibitors. When Gαo was expressed in Neuro-2A cells, there was a decrease in the endogenous level of Rap1GAPII, and this decrease could be blocked by treating the cells with MG132 (Fig. 4A). We also determined the activation state of Rap in cells transfected with Gαo in the presence and absence of proteasomal inhibitor. Gαo stimulated the activation of Rap-1, and this effect was blocked by treating the cell with a proteasomal inhibitor (Fig. 4B). Next, we determined whether we could observe the proteasome sensitivity of Gαo activation of Rap in live cells. For this, cells were transfected with GFP-tagged RalGDS-RBD that has been previously used to measure Rap activation in intact cells (14Bivona T.G. Wiener H.H. Ahearn I.M. Silletti J. Chiu V.K. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Neuro-2A cells were transfected with the fluorescent probe without or with Gαo (or Gαq as control) and then treated without or with lactacystin. The cells were imaged by confocal microscopy. The expression of Gαo, but not Gαq, led to a strong accumulation of fluorescence in the perinuclear vesicles (Fig. 4C, panel ii versus panel iv). This indicates that Rap1 is being activated in these vesicles. When the cells were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin, the Gαo-induced accumulation of fluorescence was not observed (Fig. 4C, panel ii versus panel v) indicating that Rap1 activation by Gαo is dependent on proteasomal activity in live cells. These results indicate that in Neuro-2A cells Gαo induces activation of Rap through the degradation of Rap1GAPII. If this is true, and since Rap is downstream of Gαo (Fig. 1D) in the induction of neurite outgrowth, expression of excess Rap1GAPII in the presence of a proteasomal inhibitor should block Gαo induced neurite outgrowth. To test this prediction we expressed Gαo in the presence of submaximal concentrations of Rap1GAPI and Rap1GAPII. This resulted in about a 50% inhibition of Gαo-induced neurite outgrowth. This would be expected since both RapGAPs should effectively reduce the activation of Rap1. However, the experiments in Figs. 1, 2, 3 predict that inhibiting the proteasome should selectively enhance the effect of Rap1GAPII. When the Rap1GAPI expressing cells were treated with MG-132 no further significant inhibition of neurite outgrowth was observed. However, when Rap1GAPII-expressing cells were treated with MG-132, there was a marked increase in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth with a close to complete blockage of Gαo-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4D). Taken together the experiments in Fig. 4 indicate that Gαo by inducing the degradation of Rap1GAPII activates Rap to induce neurite outgrowth. Cannabinoid receptor activity, through the Gαo/i pathway, stimulates the degradation of Rap1GAPII, the activation of Rap, and neurite outgrowth. We next determined whether the Gαo-Rap1GAPII-Rap1 pathway for the regulation of neurite outgrowth could be regulated in a receptor-dependent manner. We also tested whether the pathway and the biological effects could be observed in a completely native setting. Treatment of serumstarved Neuro-2A cells with the CB1 receptor agonist resulted in a time-dependent activation of Rap1. Activation is substantial (∼2-fold) within 1 h and maximal by 2 h. If the ligand is present, the activation persists for 16 h (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that the CB1 receptor can activate Rap relatively fast. Since the CB1 receptor is known to couple through the Gαo/i pathway, we tested whether receptor stimulation of Rap1 activation is blocked when the cells are treated with pertussis toxin. The CB1 receptor agonist did not stimulate Rap1 activation or the degradation of Rap1GAPII in cells treated with pertussis toxin (Fig. 5B, left panels). Since the coupling between Gαo and Rap is due to the degradation of Rap1GAPII we tested whether proteasomal inhibitor treatment blocked receptor activation of Rap. When CB1 receptor agonist was added to lactacystin-treated cells, the degradation of Rap1GAPII and activation of Rap was blocked. (Fig. 5B, right panels). We next tested the role of Rap in CB1 receptor-induced neurite outgrowth. For this, cells were transfected with Rap1 specific siRNA or control siRNA. The siRNA for Rap1 inhibited receptor regulated neurite outgrowth (Fig. 5C). Since both Gαo/i and Rap are downstream of the CB1 receptor for neurite outgrowth, and given the connectivity between Gαo/i and Rap1, both proteasomal inhibitors and Rap1GAPII would be predicted to block CB1-receptor induced neurite outgrowth. The experiments in Fig. 5, D and E, indicate that as predicted, treatment of cells with lactacystin or transfection with excess Rap1GAPII blocks receptor induced neurite outgrowth. These results indicate that in a fully native system the CB1 receptor through Gαo promotes the degradation of Rap1GAPII to activate Rap and induce neurite outgrowth. Typically, signaling through heterotrimeric G protein pathways involves information transfer through non-covalent protein-protein interactions or through protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions. Such regulation is often sufficient for acute signal transmission and for short term integration between signaling pathways. However, these mechanisms do not readily allow for a signaling network to propagate or integrate signals across time scales. The mechanism that we describe here allows for such capability. The regulated degradation of RapGAP occurs in a time scale of 1-2 h in two native systems (Neuro-2A cells and rat hippocampal slices). 2J. D. Jordan and R. Iyengar, unpublished observations. There is an interesting similarity both temporally as well as in configuration to another well known form of long term regulation studied in heterotrimeric G protein systems: heterologous desensitization. The phenomenon we describe here may lead to heterologous sensitization. Signal flow, through both heterotrimeric and small G protein pathways, is regulated by the activity of the corresponding GAP proteins. From a systems design perspective it would be advantageous to regulate the levels of these crucial regulators and thus set a threshold for signal flow through these pathways. The Gαo/i-mediated targeting of Rap1GAPII for proteasomal degradation indicates that such a mechanism, for signal flow as well as integration through threshold control, exists. Thus, a relatively brief activation of the Gαo/i-coupled receptor and the consequent activation of the heterotrimeric G protein Gα subunit could result in a prolonged activation of the small GTPase downstream of the heterotrimeric G protein. Duration and magnitude of activation of the small G protein often play a defining role in the conversion of biochemical signals into biological effects. A classical example is the persistent activation of Ras and the triggering of proliferation. Here it appears that Rap1 plays a crucial role in the Gαo/i pathway-induced neurite outgrowth. The mechanism that we elucidate in this study would allow Gαo/i to activate Rap1 for prolonged periods of time. These periods would be largely defined by the rates of degradation and synthesis of Rap1GAPII in cells where this isoform predominates, as is the case with Neuro-2A cells. Thus we would like to propose that signal dependent targeting of regulators for degradation by the proteasome may be one mechanism by which short duration signals in G protein pathways may be converted to long duration downstream signals. Signal transmission through regulation of GAP activity assumes the presence of a constitutively active guanine nucleotide exchange factor that would turn on the small GTPase. In our system this appears to be the case. However, it is well known that Rap is activated by several signaling pathways including the integrin pathway and Gs/cAMP pathway (15Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In such cases the simultaneous or prior activation of the Gαo/i pathway could play an interesting role in defining a graded switch allowing the cell to regulate both the duration and extent of Rap activation. Such a configuration would differ significantly from switches that arise from positive feedback where the input signal switches the system from the inactive to the active state, but the level of activation is set by the ratios of the components in the feedback loop and their activities (16Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 297: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). One advantage of having a graded switch might be to impart specificity in the engagement of down stream machinery. These potential capabilities remain to be experimentally explored. Our data indicate that there may be variations in the classical heterotrimeric G protein cycle that allows for signal propagation across time scales. This proposed model for signal flow is summarized in the schematic in Fig. 6. The data in Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that it is the unactivated Gα subunit that targets the Rap1GAPII for degradation. However, we find that the Gαo/i-coupled CB1 cannabinoid receptor stimulates the degradation of Rap1GAPII and thus activates Rap1. These seemingly contradictory results may be explained if the GTP-bound Gα subunit weakly binds Rap1GAPII, and this interaction is strengthened by the hydrolysis of the GTP. The GDP bound Gα subunit would now have a higher affinity for Rap1GAPII, which acts as a GDI for the Gα subunit preventing it from exchanging the GDP for GTP and thus keeping it in the inactive state. This higher affinity interaction would then allow the complex to stabilize such that Gα could target Rap1GAPII for degradation by the proteasome. Support for this model comes from previous observations (17Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and our own observations with Rap1GAPII, that Gβγ subunits are not associated with the complexes between inactive Gα subunits and proteins containing the GoLoco motif such as Rap1GAPII. Structural data indicate that proteins containing the GoLoco motif bind to the same region of Gα as the Gβγ subunits (12Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus it appears likely that the Gα subunit in GDP bound form could play a role in regulating signal flow prior to re-association with Gβγ and returning to the resting state. Further experiments are needed to unequivocally establish such a scheme; however, our observations are supportive of a mechanism for signal flow from heterotrimeric to small GTPases as is described in the model in Fig. 6. We do not as yet understand the mechanisms by which Gαo promotes the ubiquitination of Rap1GAPII. The simplest model would involve the presentation of Rap1GAPII to an E3 ligase. We have not as yet been able to identify the E3 ligase for Rap1GAPII and experiments to define the interactions and relationships between Gαo, Rap1GAPII, and the E3 ligase await this identification. There are some differences in our studies as compared with previous studies. Mochizuki et al. (7Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T. Kitabatake A. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Nature. 1999; 400: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) found that Rap1GAPII bound more avidly to the activated form Gαi2 as compared with WT Gαi2. We do not understand the basis for the different observations. However, that study was conducted only with exogenously expressed components and the observed interactions could be related to context of the pathway created by the exogenous expression of multiple components including a high level of receptors. Rap1GAP has also been reported to interact with Gαz, although it has not been specified if this interaction occurs with Rap1GAPI or Rap1GAPII (18Casey P.J. Meng J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43417-43424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The observations in this study highlight the multifaceted regulatory capability of the Gαo/i subunits, in contrast to Gαs and Gαq family members. Gαo/i subunits in addition to inhibiting adenylyl cyclase (19Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and stimulating STAT3 through c-Src (20Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and regulating neuronal function through GRIN (21Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26931-26938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) now appear capable of activating and modulating signal flow through the Rap1 pathway. It is interesting that in neuronal systems the Gαo/i pathway can often synergize or positively affect the cAMP pathway. This often occurs through Gβγ regulation of adenylyl cyclase 2 (22Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Our present observations suggest that it can also occur through Gα subunits, since Gα-mediated degradation of RapGAP can enhance or synergize cAMP-mediated Rap activation. Thus even well studied pathways such as the classical heterotrimeric pathway may as yet hold surprises and the complexity of upstream regulatory mechanisms within signaling networks continues to grow. Such complexity may have important biological functions. Recent studies indicate that the sequential activation of Cdc42 and Rap plays an important role in determining which neurites become axons (23Schwamborn J.C. Puschel A.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). CB1 receptors, like D2-dopamine receptors, are often presynaptic receptors that modulate transmitter release. It is possible that they are also present in growing axons and thus contribute to the activation of Rap to specify polarity during hippocampal development. Further studies are needed to determine whether such mechanisms are operative during the development of the hippocampus. We thank Drs. M. Orlowski and S. Wilk (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) for reagents and advice. We also thank Dr. Zeev Ronai for Traf vector and Susana Neves for help with the figures."
https://openalex.org/W2104216656,"Previously we demonstrated that supplementation with the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increased neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells during differentiation, and that overexpression of rat acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 6 (Acsl6, formerly ACS2) further increased PUFA-enhanced neurite outgrowth. However, whether Acsl6 overexpression enhanced the amount of PUFA accumulated in the cells or altered the partitioning of any fatty acids into phospholipids (PLs) or triacylglycerides (TAGs) was unknown. Here we show that Acsl6 overexpression specifically promotes DHA internalization, activation to DHA-CoA, and accumulation in differentiating PC12 cells. In contrast, oleic acid (OA) and AA internalization and activation to OA-CoA and AA-CoA were increased only marginally by Acsl6 overexpression. Additionally, the level of total cellular PLs was increased in Acsl6 overexpressing cells when the medium was supplemented with AA and DHA, but not with OA. Acsl6 overexpression increased the incorporation of [14C]-labeled OA, AA, or DHA into PLs and TAGs. These results do not support a role for Acsl6 in the specific targeting of fatty acids into PLs or TAGs. Rather, our data support the hypothesis that Acsl6 functions primarily in DHA metabolism, and that its overexpression increases DHA and AA internalization primarily during the first 24 h of neuronal differentiation to stimulate PL synthesis and enhance neurite outgrowth. Previously we demonstrated that supplementation with the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increased neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells during differentiation, and that overexpression of rat acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 6 (Acsl6, formerly ACS2) further increased PUFA-enhanced neurite outgrowth. However, whether Acsl6 overexpression enhanced the amount of PUFA accumulated in the cells or altered the partitioning of any fatty acids into phospholipids (PLs) or triacylglycerides (TAGs) was unknown. Here we show that Acsl6 overexpression specifically promotes DHA internalization, activation to DHA-CoA, and accumulation in differentiating PC12 cells. In contrast, oleic acid (OA) and AA internalization and activation to OA-CoA and AA-CoA were increased only marginally by Acsl6 overexpression. Additionally, the level of total cellular PLs was increased in Acsl6 overexpressing cells when the medium was supplemented with AA and DHA, but not with OA. Acsl6 overexpression increased the incorporation of [14C]-labeled OA, AA, or DHA into PLs and TAGs. These results do not support a role for Acsl6 in the specific targeting of fatty acids into PLs or TAGs. Rather, our data support the hypothesis that Acsl6 functions primarily in DHA metabolism, and that its overexpression increases DHA and AA internalization primarily during the first 24 h of neuronal differentiation to stimulate PL synthesis and enhance neurite outgrowth. Compared with other tissues, the nervous system is highly enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) 1The abbreviations used are: PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; FA, fatty acid; OA, oleic acid; AA, arachidonic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; PL, phospholipids; DAG, diacylglyceride; TAG, triacylglyceride; Acsl, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; CoA, coenzyme A; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter.1The abbreviations used are: PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; FA, fatty acid; OA, oleic acid; AA, arachidonic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; PL, phospholipids; DAG, diacylglyceride; TAG, triacylglyceride; Acsl, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; CoA, coenzyme A; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. that fall into two categories based on the presence of a double bond at the n-6 or n-3 positions of the fatty acid (FA). Arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) are the most abundant PUFAs, but cannot be synthesized de novo by mammals because the desaturase enzymes required to introduce double bonds at the n-3 and n-6 positions of FAs are not present (1Innis S.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 39-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Therefore, AA and DHA, or their precursors, must be ingested from dietary sources and transported to the brain. During late gestation and early postnatal development neurodevelopment is especially rapid and AA and DHA are critical to ensure proper brain and retina growth. AA and DHA are normally transferred by the placenta to the fetus during the last trimester of pregnancy and in breast milk to infants (2Dutta-Roy A.K. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 315S-322SCrossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, if the postnatal diet is not properly supplemented with these essential FAs, FA deficiency may manifest itself in the form of neurological and visual deficits. Premature infants are at even greater risk because they are deprived of the essential FA loading that normally occurs during the last trimester of gestational development (3Jensen C.L. Heird W.C. Clin. Perinatol. 2002; 29: 261-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Despite their obvious importance, the functions PUFAs perform during this critical period of development have yet to be defined. Several reports establish that supplementation of neuronal cells with AA or DHA can affect neurite outgrowth indicating that PUFAs may be critical for proper neuronal differentiation (4Calderon F. Kim H.Y. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 5Dehaut F. Bertrand I. Miltaud T. Pouplard-Barthelaix A. Maingault M. Neurosci.

However, little is known about the mechanism or proteins that are responsible for PUFA internalization and their subsequent metabolism.While it remains controversial how FA cross the plasma membrane, considerable evidence implicate diffusion through the PL bilayer as well as several integral and associated plasma membrane proteins as facilitators of free FA transport across the lipid bilayer (12Pownall H.J. Hamilton J.A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 178: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 454-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). After internalization, FAs are activated primarily by acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family members (Acsls, formerly ACSs), which utilize ATP to catalyze the formation of FA-CoA by esterifying the FA to coenzyme A (CoA). Once activated, the FA can function as a signaling molecule, be incorporated into phospholipids (PLs) or triacylglycerides (TAGs), or undergo β-oxidization in mitochondria for energy generation.Because Acsl proteins catalyze an essential step in the metabolism of FA, it seemed likely that multiple isoforms exist with different preferences for FA species. This was first confirmed by the biochemical isolation of an arachidonoyl-specific acyl-CoA synthetase in human platelets that was different from the original acyl-CoA synthetase enzyme that had broad FA specificity (15Wilson D.B. Prescott S.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3510-3515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, five mammalian Acsl proteins in all have been identified and biochemical studies using bacterially expressed Acsl proteins have shown that each protein activates different FAs with unique efficiencies. Acsl1 and Acsl5 activate most unsaturated FAs similarly (16Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem.

Biochem. 1996; 242: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas Acsl3, Acsl4, and Acsl6 (formerly ACS2) preferentially activate PUFAs (17Iijima H. Fujino T. Minekura H. Suzuki H. Kang M.J. Yamamoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Kang M.J. Fujino T. Sasano H. Minekura H. Yabuki N. Nagura H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T.T. Proc.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In fact, Acsl6 activates AA and DHA 2- and 8-fold more efficiently, respectively, than does Acsl1. Compared with OA, the initial rate of AA and DHA uptake was increased more in PC12 cells overexpressing Acsl6 than in cells overexpressing Acsl1, providing in vivo evidence that Acsl6 preferentially metabolizes PUFAs (7Marszalek J.R. Kitidis C. Dararutana A. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23882-23891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).A series of biochemical and cell fractionation experiments established that different Acsl proteins have unique intracellular localizations, suggesting that each protein may partition FAs toward different metabolic fates. Acsl1 protein has been proposed to function in FA internalization and TAG synthesis because it localizes to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 cells (20Lewin T.M. Kim J.H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E.

Van Horn C.G. Krisans S.K. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with these proposals, FA internalization in 3T3-L1 and PC12 cells (7Marszalek J.R. Kitidis C. Dararutana A. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23882-23891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) and TAG levels in PC12 cells (7Marszalek J.R. Kitidis C. Dararutana A. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23882-23891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) are increased in cells that overexpress Acsl1 protein. Acsl4 protein localizes to mitochondrial associated membranes and peroxisomes in primary rat hepatocytes suggesting it functions in TAG synthesis and FA oxidation (22Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Krisans S.K. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Acsl5 is the only Acsl localized to mitochondria in primary rat liver hepatocytes where it likely activates FAs for β-oxidation (22Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Krisans S.K. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The intracellular localizations of Acsl6 and Acsl3 have yet to be determined. However, Acsl6 overexpression in PC12 cells increases FA internalization, neurite outgrowth, and TAG accumulation, which are consistent with localization to the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial associated membranes. Taken together, these data suggest that differential expression of Acsl proteins may contribute to PUFA enrichment in the PLs of neurons.To test the hypothesis that Acsl6 enhances neurite outgrowth by preferential PUFA accumulation and partitioning into PLs, we overexpressed Acsl6 in differentiating PC12 cells and examined the metabolic fate of internalized FAs. We show that Acsl6 overexpression selectively enhances DHA internalization, activation to DHA-CoA and accumulation, but does not increase FA targeting to PLs relative to TAGs.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneration of Stable Acsl6 Overexpressing Cells—To generate stable populations of control and Acsl6 overexpressing PC12 cells, retroviral supernatants containing control (pMSCVpuroIRES2-EGFP) or rat Acsl6 (pMSCVpuro-ratACS2-IRES2-EGFP) retrovirus were used to infect PC12 cells as described previously (7Marszalek J.R. Kitidis C. Dararutana A. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23882-23891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Two days after infection, transformed cells were selected by incubation with 5 μg/ml puromycin for 48 h. The level of GFP fluorescence was determined for 10,000 cells using a BD Biosciences FACScan to ensure that greater than 95% of the cells were transformed. The cells were then expanded for 2 weeks, the transformation rate confirmed again by FACS analysis, and aliquots of the cells were frozen until needed. The cells used for analysis were in culture for 2–8 weeks after infection.Western Analysis of Acsl6 Protein—A peptide corresponding to the first 19 amino acids (MQTQEILRILRLPELSDLG) at the amino terminus of rat Acsl6 protein was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies to the peptide were raised in rabbits. Undifferentiated control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells were harvested, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1× sample buffer (2% SDS, 150 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 700 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at a concentration of 106 cells per ml. Cells were lysed and DNA sheared by titration through a Hamilton syringe and heated at 80 °C for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein extract from control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells were separated on a 7% NuPAGE Tris acetate gel (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Acsl6 antibody. The membrane was then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody and Acsl6 protein levels were visualized using an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to X-Omat Blue film (Kodak).Quantitative PCR—Aliquots of undifferentiated control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells were collected at the same time that these cells were plated for differentiation experiments. Total RNA was extracted and the amount of Acsl1–6 mRNAs determined as described previously (7Marszalek J.R. Kitidis C. Dararutana A. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23882-23891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activity Assay—Undifferentiated control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells were treated for 5 min at 37 °C with 0.25% trypsin and then washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in STE (10 mm Tris base, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) at 107 cells/ml, and then sonicated for 2 min in a cup sonicator. The extract was then centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 × g to remove insoluble material. The lysate was then diluted 1:4 (v/v) with STE. One hundred microliters of the extract was added to a reaction mixture containing 250 μl of 2× reaction mixture (0.1 m Tris base, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol), 50 μl of 100 mm ATP, 50 μl of 0.5 mm [14C]OA, [14C]AA, or [14C]DHA (500 ng of cold 5 mm OA per 7 ng of [1-14C]FA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals: ARC-297 (OA), ARC-290 (AA), and ARC-380 (DHA) in 1 ml of 10 mg/ml α-cyclodextrin). The reaction was started by adding 50 μl of 2 mm CoA, incubated for 5–10 min at 37 °C, and stopped by adding 2.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol, n-heptane, 1 m H2SO4 (40:10:1 by volume). Newly synthesized [14C]FA-CoA was separated from unesterified [14C]FA by first adding 0.5 ml of water and then extracting three times with 2.5 ml of n-heptane. The amount of [14C]FA-CoA synthesized was determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity in 500 μl of the aqueous phase using a scintillation counter.Differentiation of Cells for Lipid Analysis—Control and Acsl6 overexpressing PC12 cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum in RPMI 1640 medium on collagen-coated plates (VWR Biocoat) at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were split bi-weekly at 5 × 106 cells/100-mm plate. For each analysis, cells were treated for 8 min at 37 °C with 0.25% trypsin, triturated through a 19-guage needle attached to a syringe, counted, and plated in growth media at the specified concentrations. Normal differentiation medium contains 4 mol % OA, which rises to 30.7% when supplemented with 5 μm OA. Normal differentiation medium contains no AA or DHA, and the mole % rises to 19.5 and 22.0%, respectively, when supplemented with 5 μm AA or DHA (Table I). For the 15-min [14C]FA labeling experiments, cells were plated at 106 cells per well of 6-well plates. For each [14C]FA condition, 24 h after plating, the growth media was exchanged for differentiation media (0.25% horse serum, RPMI 1640, 75 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Alexis), 15 μm FA-free bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 2.5 μm [14C]FA and 2.5 μm unlabeled FA. [1-14C]OA, [1-14C]AA, and [1-14C]DHA were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals: ARC-297 (OA), ARC-290 (AA), and ARC-380 (DHA). After 15 min of incubation, each well was rinsed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% FA-free bovine serum albumin, the cells were removed and transferred to a glass tube, pelleted, and the supernatant discarded. Cell pellets were capped under a stream of nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until analysis. For 72-h incubation experiments, control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells were each plated onto 100-mm plates at 7.5 × 105 cells/plate. For total cellular PL measurements and GC/MS analysis, after 24 h growth media was exchanged for differentiation media that contained 5 μm OA, AA, or DHA. For 72-h [14C]FA labeling, 0.5 μm of the 5 μm unlabeled FA was replaced with an equivalent amount of [14C]OA, [14C]AA, or [14C]DHA. For each experiment, the cells were collected after 72 h of differentiation as described for the 15-min [14C]FA labeling experiment.Table IFatty acid composition of growth and differentiation media The molar percentages of FA in growth medium containing fetal bovine serum and differentiation media containing 0.25% horse serum (HS) supplemented with 5 μm OA, AA, or DHA were determined by GC/MS. The supplemented FAs are in bold.

Detached and dead cells were removed by centrifugation at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 min and the amount of radioactivity in the media determined by adding the media to 4 ml of EcoScint H (National Diagnostics) followed by scintillation counting.Analysis of [14C]FA Incorporation into Complex Lipids—Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.8 ml of water and vortexed vigorously to disrupt the cell pellet. A 15-μl aliquot of the cell suspension was removed and added to 45 μl of counting solution (24Soto A.M. Sonnenschein C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1985; 23: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and the concentration of cells in the suspension determined using a hemacytometer. Two milliliters of methanol and 1 ml of chloroform with 50 μg/ml butylhydroxytoluene were added to the remainder of the cell suspension, the sample was mixed vigorously and then sonicated for 30 min at room temperature in a bath sonicator. Non-solubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min in a table top centrifuge. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, 1 ml of chloroform (with 50 μg/ml butylhydroxytoluene) and 1 ml of water were added, the sample was vigorously mixed for 1 min, and the phases were clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The chloroform phase was collected, evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and resuspended in chloroform at a concentration equivalent to 107 cells/ml. Ten microliters of the 14C-labeled samples were added to 4 ml of EcoScint H and the amount of radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Twenty-five microliters of each 14C-labeled sample was spotted on a silica G plate (Analtech) for separation by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Complex lipid species were resolved by elution with petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (90:10:1). PL species were resolved by elution with chloroform/triethylamine/ethanol/water (30:30:34:8). The plates were allowed to dry overnight and then exposed for6htoa phosphorimaging screen (FujiFilm). The plates were read with a FujiFilm BAS-2500 scanner and the amount of [14C]FA incorporated into PL and TAG species were determined using Multiguage software (FujiFilm).Determination of PL Levels—Twenty-five microliters of lipid extract from 3-day differentiated cells that were supplemented with 5 μm unlabeled FA were evaporated to dryness in glass tubes under a stream of nitrogen. Fifty microliters of perchloric acid was added to each tube, then the tube was capped and placed in a 180 °C heating block overnight to liberate phosphate from the PL. Ten microliters of each sample was added to wells of a 96-well plate. One-hundred microliters of assay solution (0.29% brilliant green, 1 m ammonium molybdate, 1.2 n hydrochloric acid, and 0.05% Tween 20) was added for 15 min at room temperature. The absorbance at 660 nm was measured using a Molecular Dynamics Versamax plate reader to determine the amount of free phosphate that is a measure of PL abundance. PL levels were determined by comparing the unknown samples to a standard of known amounts of PC (Sigma) that had been treated identically.Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) of FAs—Ten microliters of 1 mg/ml 17:0 FA (internal standard) and 50 μl of lipid extract from 3-day differentiated cells that were supplemented with 5 μm unlabeled FA were evaporated to dryness in a glass tube under a stream of nitrogen. Once evaporated, 0.25 ml of toluene and 0.5 ml of 1% sulfuric acid in methanol were added, the tube were capped under nitrogen, and incubated at 50 °C overnight in a heat block. The next day, 1.25 ml of 5% NaCl was added and the suspension was mixed vigorously. FA methyl esters were extracted twice with 1 ml of hexane followed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min in a table top centrifuge. The hexane phase was washed with 1 ml of 2% potassium bicarbonate and collected again before evaporation under a stream of nitrogen. The sample was resuspended in 25 μl of methyl acetate with 50 μg/ml butylhydroxytoluene. The fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed on an Agilent 6890 series gas chromatograph equipped with a 5873 mass selective detector. Identity of the fatty acids was made by comparison with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) data base and confirmed by comparison with standards purchased from commercial sources (Sigma and Avanti). Quantification was made by comparison with the added 17:0 internal standard.RESULTSPreviously we reported that supplementation of differentiating PC12 cells with PUFAs enhances neurite outgrowth and that overexpression of Acsl6 further increases PUFA-mediated neurite outgrowth (7Marszalek J.R. Kitidis C. Dararutana A. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23882-23891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For the metabolic tests to determine whether Acsl6 overexpression selectively enhanced PUFA accumulation or targeted PUFAs into PL relative to TAG, large numbers of control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells were required. Therefore, Eco1 PC12 cells (PC12 cells overexpressing the mouse ecotropic retrovirus receptor) were infected with control or Acsl6 overexpressing retroviruses that also encoded GFP and a puromycin resistance gene. After 48 h, the cells were selected for 2 days with 5 μg/ml puromycin to obtain highly enriched populations of transformed cells. As identified by FACS analysis of GFP expression, over 95% of the cells contained an integrated retrovirus and synthesized additional Acsl6 protein (Fig. 1, A–C). To obtain sufficient numbers of cells to perform kinetic and biochemical analysis of the metabolic fate of exogenous OA, AA, and DHA during PC12 cell differentiation, these populations of transformed cells were expanded for 2–8 weeks before differentiation.Quantitative PCR was used to measure the levels of Acsl mRNAs and determine whether long-term overexpression of Acsl6 affected the expression of other Acsl mRNAs (Fig. 1D). Compared with the level of Acsl6 mRNA in control cells, the level of Acsl6 mRNA in Acsl6 overexpressing cells was increased ∼100-fold. The levels of the other Acsl mRNAs were not significantly altered in Acsl6 overexpressing cells, demonstrating that the other Acsl mRNA are not down-regulated to compensate for increased Acsl6 mRNA expression.The level of Acsl6 protein in control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells was measured to determine whether the 100-fold increase in Acsl6 mRNA translated to a similar increase in Acsl6 protein. In Acsl6 overexpressing cells, the level of Acsl6 protein increased by ∼15-fold compared with control cells (Fig. 1C), confirming that the increase in the level of Acsl6 mRNA led to a highly significant increase in Acsl6 protein accumulation.To determine whether Acsl6 overexpression selectively increased total OA-CoA, AA-CoA, or DHA-CoA synthetase activity, the conversion of each [14C]FA to [14C]FA-CoA was measured using total cellular extracts from undifferentiated control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells (Fig. 2). In control cells, the total OA-CoA synthetase activity was only 1/7th and 1/3rd the level of total AA-CoA and total DHA-CoA synthetase activities, respectively (Fig. 2). Acsl6 overexpression increased DHA-CoA synthetase activity 5-fold compared with control cells. In contrast, OA-CoA and AA-CoA synthetase activities were increased only 1.7- and 0.4-fold in Acsl6 overexpressing cells compared with control cells. These findings provide direct evidence that Acsl6 preferentially converts DHA to DHA-CoA.Fig. 2Overexpression of Acsl6 preferentially increases DHA-CoA synthesis. Cellular extracts from undifferentiated control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” The conversions of [14C]OA to [14C]OA-CoA, [14C]AA to [14C]AA-CoA, and [14C]DHA to [14C]DHA-CoA were measured to determine acyl-CoA synthetase activities in control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” The relative amounts of [14C]FA-CoA were synthesized in total cellular extracts from control and Acsl6 overexpressing cells. Equal amounts of each [14C]FA were used in the reactions.

https://openalex.org/W1995732158,"Homo- and heterodimerization of the opioid receptors with functional consequences were reported previously. However, the exact nature of these putative dimers has not been identified. In current studies, the nature of the heterodimers was investigated by producing the phenotypes of the 1:1 heterodimers formed between the constitutively expressed μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and the ponasterone A-induced expression of δ-opioid receptor (DOR) in EcR293 cells. By examining the trafficking of the cell surface-located MOR and DOR, we determined that these two receptors endocytosed independently. Using cell surface expression-deficient mutants of MOR and DOR, we observed that the corresponding wild types of these receptors could not rescue the cell surface expression of the mutants, whereas the antagonist naloxone could. Furthermore, studies with constitutive or agonist-induced receptor internalization also indicated that MOR and DOR endocytosed independently and could not “drag in” the corresponding wild types or endocytosis-deficient mutants. Additionally, the heterodimer phenotypes could be eliminated by the pretreatment of the EcR293 cells with pertussis toxin and could be modulated by the deletion of the RRITR sequence in the third intracellular loop that is involved in the receptor-G protein interaction and activation. These data suggest that MOR and DOR heterodimerize only at the cell surface and that the oligomers of opioid receptors and heterotrimeric G protein are the bases for the observed MOR-DOR heterodimer phenotypes.

The heterodimerization of the GPCRs was shown to be selective, with formation of heterodimers with some but not all subtypes of the receptors (13Jordan B.A. Devi L.A.

Most importantly, there are functional differences between the monomers and the homo- and heterodimers of the GPCRs. The classic example is the inability of individual GABAB1 and GABAB2 subunit to form a functional receptor (18Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol.

Heterooligomerization of the GPCRs with other receptor types, such as the ionotropic GABAA receptor, has been observed, resulting in the alteration in the ion-gating properties of the channels (30Liu F. Wang Q. Pristupa Z.B. Yu X.M. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Nature. 2000; 403: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). As for the opioid receptors, which belong to the rhodopsin subfamily of the GPCRs, homo- and heterodimerization of the receptors have been reported. Homodimerization of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) was reported with immunoprecipitation, and agonist-induced receptor internalization appeared to be related to the dimers formation (11Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26959-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The agonist-induced change in DOR oligomerization was not observed with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments (12McVey M. Ramsay D. Kellett E. Rees S. Wilson S. Pope A.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14092-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The κ-opioid receptor is reported to exist in homodimers and could heterodimerize with DOR but not with the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) (13Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The heterodimerization of DOR and κ-opioid receptor resulted in the decrease in the affinities of receptor-selective ligands (13Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The DOR and κ-opioid receptor could also heterodimerize with the β2-adrenergic receptor, resulting in an alteration of β2-adrenergic receptor functionality (31Jordan B.A. Trapaidze N. Gomes I. Nivarthi R. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 343-348Google Scholar). The most interesting of the heterodimers is the reported heterodimerization of the MOR and DOR receptors. Using different epitope-tagged receptors, both George et al. (15George S.R. Fan T. Xie Z. Tse R. Tam V. Varghese G. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26128-26135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and Gomes et al. (14Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Trapaidze N. Nagy V. Devi L.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar) reported the ability of MOR and DOR to heterodimerize. Both groups reported a change in functionality of the receptor, but George et al. (15George S.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26128-26135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) reported that the heterodimer function appeared to be insensitive to pertussis toxin pretreatment, implying coupling to G proteins other than Gi/Go (15George S.R.

The exact nature of the opioid receptor homo- and heterodimerization has not been defined. Two general schemes for the dimerization of GPCRs have been proposed by Reynolds and co-workers (32Dean M.K. Higgs C. Smith R.E. Bywater R.P. Snell C.R. Scott P.D. Upton G.J.G. Howe T.J. Reynolds C.A. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4595-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); 1) the 1:1 stoichiometric molecular complexes of the receptors or contact dimers and 2) the swapping of the transmembrane domains of the GPCRs. The domain swapping was initially suggested by Gouldson et al. (5Gouldson P.R. Snell C.R. Bywater R.P. Higgs C. Reynolds C.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) to explain the ability of adrenergic-muscarinic receptor fragments 1–5 and 6–7 to function as autonomous folding units when co-expressed in the same cells (33Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 34Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Using computational three-dimensional models of the opioid receptors, Filizola and Weinstein (35Filizola M. Weinstein H. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) suggested the most likely interfaces between the opioid receptor homodimers are TM4-TM4, TM4-TM5, and TM5-TM5 for DOR, TM1-TM1 for MOR, and TM5-TM5 for κ-opioid receptor. These hypotheses do not consider the possible roles intracellular domains could have, as in the case of GABAB receptors heterodimerization (36Robbins M.J. Calver A.R. Filippov A.K. Hirst W.D.

Bettler B. Prézeau L. Pin J.-P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and of adrenergic-muscarinic receptor heterodimerization (34Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hence, to investigate the nature of the putative MOR and DOR heterodimers, DOR expression in the EcR293 cells constitutively expressing MOR was controlled by the ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression system. The role of the intracellular domains in the formation of the MOR and DOR heterodimers, particularly those domains within the third intracellular loop that are involved in G protein coupling, was investigated. It could be demonstrated from our current studies that the observed heterodimer phenotypes are the results of opioid receptors interaction with the G proteins. Expression of MOR and DOR in the EcR293 Cells—The mouse MOR tagged with the human hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) and mouse DOR tagged with the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) were subcloned in pCDNAmp and in the pINDsp1 vectors, respectively. EcR293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15 mm glucose, 0.43 m NaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mg/ml Zeocin, and 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM growth medium) in a 10% CO2 incubator. These EcR293 cells, derived from HEK293 cells stably expressing the heterotrimic ecdysone receptor and the retinoid X receptor and obtained from the manufacturer (Invitrogen), were transfected with 10 μg of the above plasmids in a 4:1 ratio (MOR:DOR). The colonies surviving the antibiotic Geneticin (G418) selection (1 mg/ml) were combined. The EcR293 cell mixture constitutively expressing MOR was isolated by fluorescence flow cytometry (FACS) using the monoclonal antibodies 16B12 for HA and the Alexa™488-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. Subsequently, the population of the EcR293 cells that expressed DOR within the MOR-expressing population was isolated by treating the cells with 1 μm ponasterone A for 48 h, and the DOR-expressing cells were identified by FACS using the monoclonal antibodies M2 for FLAG (Sigma) and the Alexa488™-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. The expression of MOR and DOR in the cells selected by FACS was substantiated with the [3H]diprenorphine receptor binding assays with intact cells. The EcR293 cells expressing both receptors were maintained in the DMEM medium supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml G418. Membrane Preparation and Radioligand Binding—Competition binding studies were carried out with membranes isolated from EcR293 cells expressing the MOR and DOR receptors. EcR293 cells were treated with 0 or 2 μm ponasterone A (PA) for 48 h before harvesting by phosphate-buffered saline-EDTA (0.1 m NaCl, 0.01 m NaH2PO4, 0.04% EDTA, pH 7.4). The cell pellets were then homogenized in a sucrose-HEPES solution (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7) with a glass Dounce homogenizer. After centrifuging at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove the unbroken cell and nuclei, the membranes were isolated by centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The final pellets were resuspended in the sucrose-HEPES solution. After the protein concentrations of the pellets were determined by the Lowry method, [3H]diprenorphine (2 nm) binding in the presence or absence of 10 μm naloxone were carried out so as to determine the specific binding. The percentages of MOR and DOR in the total specific binding were determined by carrying out the [3H]diprenorphine binding in the presence of 1 μm CTOP (selective antagonist for MOR) or 1 μm TIPPΨ (selective antagonist for DOR), respectively. Competition binding assays were performed by varying the concentrations of agonists and antagonists from 10–11 to 10–4 m. Prism 3 program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) was used to analyze and determine the relative Ki values from the competition binding experiments. All binding experiments were performed in triplicate, and 3–6 competition binding assays were carried out for individual agonist or antagonists. Intracellular cAMP Measurements—The ability of opioid agonists to inhibit the forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was determined by measuring the intracellular cAMP level in the EcR293 expressing either MOR alone or MOR and DOR together. The amplified luminescent proximity homogenous assays (AlphaScreen™) for cAMP supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA) were used to determine the cAMP levels. Twenty-four hours before the assays EcR293 cells treated with 0 or 2 μm PA for 24 h were plated into 96-well plates. Various concentrations of opioid agonists and antagonists were diluted with Krebs-Ringer·Hepes·buffer containing 10 μm forskolin and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. After removal of the growth medium, the 96-well plates were placed on ice, and 100 μl of the drug solution was added to the well, with 4 wells per drug concentration. After sealing the plates with HotSeal™ (Diversified Biotech, Boston, MA), the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Afterward, the plates were placed in a water bath at 85–90 °C for 5 min so as to lyse the cells and to release the intracellular cAMP. After centrifuging the plates at 500 × g for 2 min, the amount of cAMP in 4 μl of the supernatant was determined using the donor beads coated with streptavidin, acceptor beads coated with anti-cAMP antibodies, and biotinylated cAMP in the AlphaScreen™ assay system. The cAMP concentrations, from 10–11 to 10–4 m, were used to construct the standard curve. The donor beads (final 20 μg/ml), the acceptor beads (final 15 μg/ml), and biotinylated cAMP (final 10 nm) were diluted in the 1× control buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.3% Tween 20 (60%) and Hanks' buffered salts saline (40%)). 4 μl of the reaction supernatant or standard cAMP solutions were pipetted into duplicate wells of a 384-well Opti-plate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a Biomek 2000 (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) in a dimly lit room at 4 °C. The plate was then sealed with TopSeal™ adhesive sealing films (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 2 h. Then 12 μl of the donor beads were pipetted into the wells, and the mixtures were incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 18–24 h. After equilibrating to room temperature in the dark (4 h), the content of the cAMP in each well was determined by exciting the donor beads at 680 nm, generating a singlet O2, resulting in the fluorescence emission of the acceptor beads at 520–620 nm. The fluorescence of the wells was measured with the Fusion™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) plate reader, and the amount of cAMP in each sample was extrapolated from the standard curve. The dose response curves of the opioid agonists were constructed accordingly. The IC50 value and the maximal inhibition level for individual agonist were obtained from Prism 3 program analyses of 3–12 dose-response curves. Fluorescence Flow Cytometry—The opioid receptors located on the plasma membrane was quantified by assaying the cell surface immunofluoresence using FACS. Briefly, EcR293 cells were treated with 0 or 2 μm PA for 48 h. Then cells were treated with 1 μm etorphine for different time periods or with various concentrations of etorphine for 60 min so as to induce receptor internalization. For the experiments in which the turnover of the cell surface-located receptors was measured, media containing PA were removed, and the cells were washed and refed with fresh medium. Before the addition of antibodies, EcR293 cells were rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM. Then the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min in serum-free DMEM with either anti-HA (1:500 dilution) or anti-FLAG (1:300) antibody. Afterward, the cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated with Alexa488™-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:400 dilution) at 4 °C for an additional 1 h. Then the cells were washed and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde before quantitating the receptor immunoreactivity with fluorescence flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). Fluorescence intensity of 10,000 cells was collected for each sample. Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences) was used to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells population. All FACS analyses were conducted three times with triplicate in each experiment. Surface Biotinylation—To examine the constitutive internalization of MOR and DOR, the cell surface-located opioid receptors were biotinylated. EcR293 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and treated with 0 or 2 μm PA for 48 h. Normally, biotinylation was carried out with cells reaching 90% confluency in the dishes. After washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cell surface proteins were biotinylated by incubating with 300 μg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4 °C. Unreacted biotin was quenched and washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 154 mm NaCl) at 4 °C. Then pre-warmed DMEM medium (37 °C) was added to the cells for 1 h. Afterward, the remaining cell surface biotin was stripped with a solution containing 50 mm glutathione, 0.3 m NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, and 1% fetal bovine serum at 4 °C for 30 min. For the control, the cells were not treated with such stripping solution. Cells were then extracted with cell lysis buffer (0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, protease inhibitor mixture tablet Complete (Roche Applied Science; 1 tablet/50 ml)). Cellular debris was removed by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Clarified cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with immobilized streptavidin at 4 °C overnight. After washing five times with cell lysis buffer, the beads were extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in transfer buffer (48 mm Tris-HCl, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol) and blocked for 60 min in a blocking solution (10% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline). Receptors were detected by subsequent incubation with mouse anti-HA (1:2000) for MOR or rabbit anti-DOR (1:500) and goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:5000), both 60-min incubations. Proteins bands were detected by the addition of the ECF substrate, and fluorescence of the bands was determined with Storm 840 (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were quantitated and analyzed using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). The ability of MOR and DOR to heterodimerize has been reported previously (14Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Trapaidze N. Nagy V. Devi L.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar, 15George S.R. Fan T. Xie Z. Tse R. Tam V. Varghese G. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26128-26135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In those studies the binding properties and functions of various ligands were examined in cells expressing one type of the receptors and compared with those in cells expressing both receptors. Because cellular background could affect the opioid responses, we decided to re-evaluate the possible interaction between MOR and DOR in the same population of cells that express one type of the receptors and, by induction, express both types of the receptors. This was accomplished by selecting EcR293 cells constitutively expressing MOR and additionally culturing these cells in the presence of PA to stimulate the expression of both MOR and DOR. As summarized in Fig. 1A, in the absence of PA, 0.46 ± 0.025 pmol/mg of MOR was expressed in the EcR293 cells, as defined by the amount of [3H]diprenorphine binding competed by 1 μm CTOP, a MOR-selective antagonist. Meanwhile, 0.057 ± 0.003 pmol/mg of DOR was detected in these EcR293 cells, as defined by specific binding in the presence of 1 μm TIPPΨ, a DOR-selective antagonist. The low level or absence of DOR expression in the absence of PA was substantiated by the absence of DOR protein in the Western analyses as shown in the left-hand panel of Fig. 1B. However, when the EcR293 was treated with various concentrations of PA for 48 h, there was a concentration-dependent increase in the DOR-specific binding, with a slight decrease in the MOR binding to a plateau level of ∼0.35 pmol/mg of protein. At 2 μm PA, the amount of DOR (0.43 ± 0.039 pmol/mg of protein) statistically was not different from the MOR level (0.37 ± 0.033 pmol/mg of protein) expressed in these EcR293 cells. The presence of DOR protein was also demonstrated with the Western analyses (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the constitutively expressed MOR could be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies only when the FLAG-DOR was induced by PA treatment and was PA concentration-dependent (Fig. 1B). Thus, in subsequent experiments EcR293 cells were treated with 2 μm PA for 48 h to achieve a 1:1 MOR:DOR ratio and apparent receptor heterodimerization. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation, one of the evidences in support of MOR/DOR heterodimerization was the differences in the affinities of the ligands between the receptor heterodimers and homodimers or monomers (14Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Trapaidze N. Nagy V. Devi L.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar, 15George S.R. Fan T. Xie Z. Tse R. Tam V. Varghese G. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26128-26135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In current studies the affinities of several MOR-selective agonists for the homodimers or monomers were compared with those for the heterodimers. To limit the differences in cellular background, EcR293 expressing only DOR was used in our comparison. As summarized in Table I, the MOR-selective agonists, endomorphin-2 and PL017, exhibited low or no affinities for the DOR. Interestingly, although endomorphin-1 and -2 have been reported previously to be highly selective agonists for MOR (39Zadina J.E. Hackler L. Ge L.J. Kastin A.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar), endomorphin-1 exhibited some affinity for DOR, whereas endomorphin-2 did not. Endomorphin-2 has similar selectivity for MOR and DOR as PL017 (Table I). The affinities of these two endomorphins for MOR were very si"

The E6 protein of malignancy-associated human papillomaviruses increases cellular telomerase in primary human keratinocytes at least partly via transcriptional activation of the telomerase catalytic subunit, hTERT. In the present study, we investigated whether E6AP, a ubiquitin ligase well known for binding and mediating some of the activities of the E6 oncoprotein, participated in the transactivation of the hTERT promoter. Our results demonstrate that E6 mutants that fail to bind E6AP are also defective for increasing telomerase activity and transactivating the hTERT promoter. More importantly, E6AP knock-out mouse cells and small interfering RNA techniques demonstrated that E6AP was required for hTERT promoter transactivation in both mouse and human cells. Neither E6 nor E6AP bound to the hTERT promoter or activated the promoter in the absence of the partner protein. With all transactivation-competent E6 proteins, induction of the hTERT promoter was dependent upon E box elements in the core promoter. It appears, therefore, that E6-mediated activation of the hTERT promoter requires a complex of E6-E6AP to engage the hTERT promoter and that activation is dependent upon Myc binding sites in the promoter. The recruitment of a cellular ubiquitin ligase to the hTERT promoter during E6-mediated transcriptional activation suggests a role for the local ubiquitination (and potential degradation) of promoter-associated regulatory proteins, including the Myc protein.

Both are required and sufficient for the efficient immortalization of primary keratinocytes (2Munger K. Phelps W.C. Bubb V. Howley P.M. Schlegel R. J.

Although the best known function of HPV E6 is the targeting and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein (5Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M.

In order for E6 to bind and degrade p53, it must first form a complex with the cellular ubiquitin ligase, E6AP. Although the precise orientation of the E6-E6AP-p53 complex is unresolved, it appears that there is a small helical domain within E6AP (L2G) that allows E6 to bind and then associate with p53 (33Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Not all E6 target proteins use this domain for binding, however. For example, E6 binding to paxillin is dependent upon a PDZ domain (11Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 12Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A. Fujita M. Hayashi Y. Akiyama T. Ishibashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas E6 binding to p300 involves three noncontiguous regions unrelated to L2G (22Patel D. Huang S.M. Baglia L.A. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5061-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The E6-p300 binding is also independent of E6AP and does not result in protein degradation. Thus, E6 binding to target proteins can proceed via either L2G domains, PDZ domains, or new uncharacterized sequences. Several studies also suggest that E6 has p53-independent activities that may yet be dependent on E6AP. For example, the bovine papillomavirus type 1 E6 protein, which does not directly degrade the p53 protein, still interacts with E6AP, and this interaction correlates with its transforming activity (35Chen J.J. Hong Y. Androphy E.J. Virology. 1997; 236: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Ned R. Allen S. Vande Pol S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4866-4870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the HPV-16 E6 mutant, E6–8S9A10T, which cannot degrade p53, still binds E6AP and induces telomerase (37Gewin L. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7198-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Indeed, many of the growth-promoting effects of E6 cannot be mimicked by p53 degradation. Transgenic mice expressing HPV-16 E6 in the basal layer of the skin display cellular hyperproliferation and epidermal hyperplasia and develop malignant skin cancers, but p53-null mice do not (38Song S. Pitot H.C. Lambert P.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5887-5893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E6 also confers resistance to serum- and calcium-induced differentiation of human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) (39Sherman L. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3269-3279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the analysis of E6 mutants, Mdm-2 overexpression, and dominant negative p53 constructs indicates that p53 degradation is insufficient to induce these cellular alterations (40Sherman L. Jackman A. Itzhaki H. Stoppler M.C. Koval D. Schlegel R. Virology. 1997; 237: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Evidently, there are additional E6 targets that are critical for inducing abnormal cell proliferation, and it is presumed that some of these targets require E6-E6AP interactions. E6AP belongs to a class of ubiquitin-protein ligases called HECT E3 proteins, which directly transfer ubiquitin to their substrates (41Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 42Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). E6AP function is critical for normal development, and the disruption of E6AP expression in the hippocampal and Purkinje neurons of the brain induces a severe mental retardation and coordination disorder known as the Angelman syndrome (43Kishino T. Lalande M. Wagstaff J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 44Matsuura T. Sutcliffe J.S. Fang P. Galjaard R.J. Jiang Y.H. Benton C.S. Rommens J.M. Beaudet A.L. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of HECT proteins is a conserved 350-amino acid region defined by its homology to the E6AP carboxyl terminus (HECT). The HECT domain binds to specific E2 enzymes and contains an active site cysteine residue that forms a thiolester bond with ubiquitin (41Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 45Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, E6AP also appears to function independently as a coactivator for the nuclear hormone receptors (46Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Smith C.L. Lev-Lehman E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). HPV-16 E6 protein increases telomerase activity in primary keratinocytes, and this induction is also independent of its ability to degrade p53 (47Klingelhutz A.J. Foster S.A. McDougall J.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase that synthesizes repeat DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes termed telomeres (48Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The absence of telomerase activity in most normal human cells results in the progressive shortening of telomeres with each cell division (49Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W.

The telomerase enzyme is a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of two core subunits, a template RNA subunit (hTR) (52Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R.

Whereas the hTR template subunit is ubiquitously and equivalently expressed in both normal and tumor tissues (56Avilion A.A. Piatyszek M.A. Gupta J. Shay J.W. Bacchetti S. Greider C.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 645-650PubMed Google Scholar), the hTERT subunit is selectively expressed in a small subset of normal cells (possibly transient amplifying cells), tumor tissues, and tumor-derived cell lines (53Nakamura T.M.

In addition, the introduction of a dominant-negative hTERT into cancer cells inhibits telomerase activity and limits their growth (54Meyerson M. Counter C.M. Eaton E.N. Ellisen L.W. Steiner P.

More recent studies have shown that E6 induces the hTERT promoter (17Veldman T. Liu X. Yuan H. Schlegel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 2001; 75: 7198-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Myc protein binding sites (E boxes) in the hTERT promoter are required for E6 induction (17Veldman T. Liu X. Yuan H.

Virol. 2003; 77: 9852-9861Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting that Myc protein plays an important role in mediating the induction of hTERT. It does not appear, however, that E6 transactivates the Myc-responsive hTERT promoter by increasing Myc protein levels; most studies suggest that Myc levels remain constant in keratinocytes transduced with the E6 gene (17Veldman T. Liu X. Yuan H. Schlegel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8211-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 37Gewin L. Galloway D.A. J.

Rather, we have shown that E6 binds to Myc in vivo and that both proteins are associated with the activated hTERT promoter. It is hypothesized that E6 alters the transcriptional activity of Myc, thereby enhancing hTERT expression. In the present study, we demonstrate that the induction of the hTERT promoter requires both the E6 and E6AP proteins, that the E6 and E6AP proteins are physically and functionally associated with this promoter, and that the E6 and E6AP proteins appear to form a complex prior to promoter engagement. It is possible that requisite recruitment of E6AP to the hTERT promoter by E6 reflects a requirement for the local ubiquitination of promoter-associated proteins such as Myc. Cell Culture and Plasmids—Primary HFKs were cultured from neonatal foreskins as described (64Schlegel R. Phelps W.C. Zhang Y.L. Barbosa M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3181-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and maintained in keratinocyte growth media (Invitrogen), supplemented with gentamycin (50 μg/ml). Primary HFKs P8 (passage 8) were infected with amphotropic LXSN retroviruses expressing AU1-tagged HPV-16 WT E6 (E6A), E6A/8S9A10T, E6A/Δ9–13, or 6bE6A, as described elsewhere (37Gewin L.

Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated with TRIZol reagent (Invitrogen), and DNA was removed using the DNA-free kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized with some modifications using 1 μg of total cellular RNA following the instructions of the Superscript first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Five percent of the RNase H-treated cDNA products were subjected to PCR in a total volume of 50 μl containing 10 μm sense primer and 10 μm antisense primer as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C was followed by 30 cycles of PCR amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s). PCR products were analyzed for E6 mRNA with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technology) and analyzed for E6AP and GAPDH mRNA with 1.5% agarose gel. The primers used for RT-PCR were as follows: 5′-ATGTTTCAGGACCCACAGGA-3′ and 5′-CAGCTGGGTTTCTCTACGTGTT-3′ for E6 (size of PCR product, full-length E6: 453 bp for WT and 8S9A10T, 438 bp for Δ9–13; E6*I: 270 bp for WT and 8S9A10T, 255 bp for Δ9–13; E6*II: 153 bp for WT and 8S9A10T, 138 bp for Δ9–13); 5′-AAAGGGACATGTCATAAAAGAGAATTTG-3′ and 5′-AACTTATTACTTATAAAGTCATAAGC-3′ for E6AP primers (413 bp); 5′-CTCAGACACCATGGGGAAGGTGA-3′ and 5′-ATGATCTTGAGGCTGTTGTCATA-3′ for GAPDH (458 bp). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—HFKs transduced with HPV E6A were grown to 80–90% confluence in 100-mm dishes, and E6AP knock-out cells were cotransfected with the pGL3-255 hTERT promoter plasmid plus HPV-16 E6A and HA-tagged E6AP expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). ChIP was performed as described previously (17Veldman T. Liu X. Yuan H. Schlegel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8211-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).

PCR products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide stain. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Immunoprecipitation and Western blot were performed as described previously (68Suprynowicz F.A. Sparkowski J. Baege A. Schlegel R. J. Biol.

Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8244-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and monoclonal anti-β-actin (A-5441; Sigma), respectively. siRNA Transfection—HeLa cells at 50% confluence or HFKs transduced with HPV-16 E6A at 60–70% confluence were transfected with a final concentration of 20 nm negative control siRNA or E6AP-specific siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon) with OligofectAmine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested for a luciferase assay, RT-PCR, Western blot, and telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay, respectively. For the luciferase assay, HeLa cells and E6-transduced HFKs were co-transfected with siRNA duplexes plus pGL3B-255 hTERT and the Renilla reniformis luciferase gene. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—1 × 105 telomerase-negative HFK cells were seeded onto 24-well plates and grown overnight. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Cotransfections were performed using 0.5 μg of a core hTERT reporter plasmid (pGL3B-255) and 20 ng of each expression vector as indicated (AU1-tagged HPV-16 E6 or mutants, HA-tagged E6AP in pCMV4 from Peter Howley) or empty vectors as control for basal promoter activity. Cells were also cotransfected with 2 ng of the pRL-CMV plasmid (Promega), which contains the R. reniformis luciferase gene as a transfection control. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 24 h after transfection using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). TRAP and Real Time Quantitative TRAP (70Baege A.C. Berger A.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7815-7824PubMed Google Scholar)—HFKs transduced with LXSN, E6A, E6A/8S9A10T, or 6bE6A were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes to 80% confluence, harvested by trypsinization, washed in cold PBS, and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Cell pellets were lysed for 30 min on ice in 400 μl of TRAP buffer (0.5% Chaps, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad). A TRAP assay was performed on 1 μg of protein lysates as described, with some modifications. Lysates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 1× PCR buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl), 100 ng of telomerase substrate primer 5′-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT-3′,50 μmol/liter each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μg of T4 gene protein (Roche Applied Science). After initial denaturation for 4 min at 94 °C, 100 ng of downstream primer 5′-CCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTAA-3′ and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase were added, followed by 31 cycles of PCR amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s). Twenty percent of the PCR products were separated on 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized using the Gelcode color silver staining kit (Pierce). For the quantitative TRAP assay, the first step of the assay was essentially the same as the above conventional protocol. In detail, each 40-μl reaction contained 2.0 μg of cell lysate diluted into 26 μl of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1× TRAP reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 63 mm KCl), 50 μm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0.1 μg of telomerase substrate primer, and 0.2 μg of T4 gene protein (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then telomerase was inactivated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. In the second step of the assay, real time quantitative PCR was used to quantitate the number of substrate molecules to which telomeric repeats had been added. SYBR Green real time quantitative PCR assays were carried out. Each 25-μl reaction contained 300 nm telomerase substrate and ACX (5′-GCGCGGCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTAACC-3′) primers and 1.0 μl of"

MAPK pathway activation requires the cytoskeletal scaffold protein filamin A. Here we examine the interactions of CaR with filamin A in HEK-293 and M2 or A7 melanoma cells to determine how interactions with filamin A facilitate signaling. Filamin A interacts with CaR through two predicted β-strands from residues 962 to 981; interactions between filamin A and CaR are greatly enhanced by exposure to 5 mm Ca2+. Truncations or deletions (from 972 to 997 or 962 to 981) of the CaR carboxyl terminus eliminate high affinity interactions with filamin A, but CaR-mediated MAPK pathway activation still occurs. CaR-mediated ERK phosphorylation can be localized to a predicted α-helix proximal to the membrane, which has been shown to be important for G protein-mediated signaling (residues 868–879). In M2 cells (–filamin A), CaR expression levels are very low; cotransfection of CaR with filamin A increases total cellular CaR and increases plasma membrane localization of CaR, facilitating CaR signaling to the MAPK pathway; similar results were obtained in HEK-293 cells. Interaction with filamin A increases cellular CaR by preventing CaR degradation, thereby facilitating CaR signaling. In addition, filamin A facilitates signaling to the MAPK pathway even by CaR truncations or deletion mutants that cannot engage in high affinity interactions with filamin A, suggesting the targeting of critical signaling proteins to CaR.

CaR activation acutely regulates cellular functions through heterotrimeric G proteins (Gq and/or Gi, depending upon cell type) and activation of phospholipase C, resulting in production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, increases in intracellular Ca2+, activation of phospholipases D and A2, alterations in lipid metabolism, and regulation of ion channels (2Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). CaR contributes to long term regulation of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (reviewed in Ref. 3Hofer A.M.

Filamin A is a large (280 kDa) actin-binding protein that functions as a dimer; each subunit possesses an amino-terminal actin binding domain and 24 repeats of an immunoglobulin-like β-sheet unit of 96 amino acids each, with hinges that introduce bends in the structure located between repeats 15 and 16 and 23 and 24 (reviewed in Ref. 6Stossel T.P.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3830-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study, we refine the location of the high affinity binding site for filamin A on the CaR carboxyl terminus, and we determine the consequences on MAPK signaling of selective deletion of the filamin A-binding site or CaR carboxyl-terminal truncations. Paradoxically, CaR-mediated activation of the MAPK pathway is not inhibited by deletions or truncations of the carboxyl terminus which remove the high affinity filamin A interaction domain. MAPK signaling is dependent upon the presence of an α-helix (residues 868–879) shown previously to be involved in G protein-mediated signaling (21Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Bourguignon L. Shoback D. J. Biol.

We find that interaction with filamin A stabilizes CaR and attenuates its degradation rate, facilitating MAPK signaling. Materials—Tissue culture medium and serum were obtained from Invitrogen. The HEK-293 cells were from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The human filamin A construct and the M2 and A7 cell lines (19Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) were provided by Drs. Thomas Stossel and Yasutaka Ohta (Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA). Human CaR cDNA was obtained from Klaus Seuwen (Novartis Pharma, AG, Basel, Switzerland). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs and Promega. M2-FLAG monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. The rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (p42/44) and antibody against total ERK were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against CaR was generated against the “LRG” epitope defined by Goldsmith et al. (24Goldsmith P.K. Fan G. Miller J.L. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin was from Pierce. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK-293 cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (37 °C, 5% CO2). M2 and A7 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 8% newborn calf serum and 2% fetal calf serum. A7 medium also contained 500 μg/ml G418. HEK-293, M2, or A7 cells were transiently transfected with up to 4 μg of each human CaR cDNA construct with 5 μl of Novafector (Venn Nova LLC, Pompana, FL) and 100 μl of DMEM or minimal essential medium, according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown on collagen-coated plates, and experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection. Generation of CaR Truncations, Domain Deletions, and Point Mutants—Human CaR and a construct containing an amino-terminal FLAG epitope and a carboxyl-terminal fusion to EGFP (F-CaR-EGFP) were prepared as described previously (25Gama L. Wilt S.G. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39053-39059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). CaR truncations also contained an amino-terminal FLAG epitope (but no carboxyl-terminal EGFP) and were prepared by generating a PCR product containing an XhoI site and an AflII site, using the original F-CaR-EGFP as the template. One forward primer and a series of reverse primers were used for subsequent PCRs (primer sequences available upon request). After amplification, the products were cut with XhoI-AflII and subcloned in-frame into the original F-CaR-EGFP construct, which had been cut with XhoI/AflII. For deletion of the CaR residues from 972 to 997 or 962 to 981, two separate fragments were produced by PCR, using two pairs of primers that contained restriction sites XhoI/AgeI and AgeI/AflII (sequences available upon request). The PCR products were digested with XhoI/AgeI and Age1/AflII, respectively, and subsequently were subcloned into the F-CaR-EGFP plasmid. Point mutations were generated by a modified inverse PCR mutagenesis method (26Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 814-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All CaR truncations and point mutants were verified by dideoxy-DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Assay of Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK1/2) Activation—HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with wtCaR, CaR truncations, or domain deletions and grown in 12-well plates for 48 h. Prior to the experiment, cells were incubated overnight in 0.5 mm Ca2+, serum-free DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were exposed to varying levels of extracellular Ca2+ (0.5–5 mm) for 10 min (or for times as indicated) at 37 °C, and reactions were halted with 1 mm EDTA in PBS on ice. The cells were lysed (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 tablet protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics)), and Western blotting analysis was performed as described by Hjalm et al. (5Hjalm G. MacLeod R.J. Kifor O. Chattopadhyay N. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34880-34887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Blot were probed with anti-ERK1/2 or anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (p42/44) polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Densitometry analysis was performed with Kodak Digital Science™ 1D Image Analysis software. Coimmunoprecipitation—Transfected HEK-293 cells were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). After brief sonication (6 × 10 s) on ice, the lysate was agitated at 4 °C for 30 min and incubated with 20 μl of protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 1 h to minimize nonspecific binding. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C; 2 μl of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or anti-filamin A antibody (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd., Newcastle, UK) was added to 600 μl of supernatant and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) was added to each tube and rotated at 4 °C for 18 h. The resin was washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer and incubated in 25 μl of Western blot loading buffer (12 m urea, 4% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 200 mm Tris) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were run on 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (27Pace A.J. Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11629-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and blots were probed with anti-filamin A, anti-FLAG, or anti-CaR (LRG) antibody at 1:4000 dilutions. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Biotinylation of plasma membrane-localized proteins was performed with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0. The cell suspension in PBS, pH 8.0, was incubated in 1 mg/ml biotin reagent at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were subsequently washed three times with PBS plus 100 mm glycine, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Invitrogen) for Western blot analysis. Antisense Inhibition of CaR Biosynthesis—Antisense against CaR was used to inhibit CaR biosynthesis. A 1373-bp human CaR cDNA EcoRI fragment was subcloned in antisense orientation into pcDNA3.1, as described previously (41Maldonado-Pérez D. Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Elliott A.C. Ward D.T. Riccardi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003; 311: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). HEK-293 or M2 melanoma cells were transiently transfected with CaR (2 μg/35-mm dish) + filamin A or vector pcDNA3 (5 μg/35-mm dish) for 48 h and then transfected with 15 μg of antisense CaR cDNA in 100 μl of DMEM containing 10 μl of NovaFector. The medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum after 24 h. After 48 or 72 h, cells were washed twice in PBS, 1 mm EDTA on ice. Cells were collected and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer. Homogenates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 4 °C), and protein concentration was measured by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equivalent amounts of protein extracts (20 μg) were electrophoresed through 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blot was incubated with a polyclonal anti-CaR antibody (LRG) in 5% serum/TBST buffer at 4 °C overnight. The blot was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized by the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). Sequence Analysis and Statistics—Secondary structure predictions were derived from web-based programs (PSA Protein Structure Prediction server (www.bu.edu/psa), the PredictProtein server (www.embl-heidelberg.de/predictprotein/predictprotein.html)) and disordered regions were predicted by PONDR (www.pondr.com/) (28Dunker A.

Data are presented as mean ± S.E. and represent the averages of at least three independent transfections. Filamin A Facilitates CaR-mediated MAPK Activation— ERK1/2 phosphorylation (ERK1/2∼P) was assayed in HEK-293 cells expressing human CaR. As shown in Fig. 1A, 5 mm Ca2+ induces a robust elevation of ERK1/2∼P in cells stably transfected with CaR; increases in ERK1/2∼P occur within 5 min and persist for over 2 h. Untransfected HEK-293 cells show a negligible increase in ERK1/2∼P in response to a 10-min exposure to 5 mm Ca2+. The total amount of ERK1/2 was not changed significantly during a 2-h treatment with 5 mm Ca2+. Subsequent experiments utilize a 10-min exposure to 5 mm Ca2+ to assess CaR-mediated MAPK signaling. The requirement for filamin A in CaR-mediated ERK1/2∼P is illustrated in Fig. 1B. M2 melanoma cells do not express endogenous filamin A and are an important cell type in which to study filamin A-mediated processes (19Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). A7 cells are M2 melanoma cells stably transfected with filamin A, restoring filamin A-dependent functions in the M2 cell background. Exposure of M2 cells transiently expressing wtCaR to 5 mm Ca2+ does not induce significant ERK1/2∼P (Fig. 1B). In contrast, both M2 cells transiently transfected with wtCaR plus filamin A or A7 cells transfected with wtCaR display significant increases in ERK1/2∼P after 10 min of exposure to 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 1B), supporting the requirement for filamin A in CaR-mediated MAPK signaling. The High Affinity Filamin A Interaction Domain of CaR Is Localized to Residues 962–981—To determine whether CaR and filamin A interact in vivo, FLAG-CaR-EGFP (termed wtCaR), various truncations of the CaR carboxyl terminus (Δ868, Δ880, Δ886, Δ890, Δ908, and Δ1024 all truncated from FLAG-CaR), and CaR containing a deletion of residues 972–997 (FLAG-CaR972Δ, termed 972Δ) were transiently coexpressed with filamin A in HEK-293 cells. Cells were exposed to 5 mm Ca2+ for 10 min (37 °C). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-filamin A antibody. Western blots were probed with an anti-FLAG antibody to test for the presence of CaR. Fig. 2A illustrates the carboxyl-terminal regions of the receptor constructs studied, from the end of transmembrane helix 7 at residues 860/861 (indicated by black box); the dark gray box indicates the location of the filamin A interaction domain (residues 972–997) defined as the minimal overlap encompassed by the results of two published yeast two-hybrid screens (4Awata H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49691-49699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The anti-filamin A antibody was able to immunoprecipitate wtCaR and the CaRΔ1024 truncation, i.e. only those receptors containing the filamin A interaction domain (Fig. 2B). All other CaR truncations and the deletion CaR972Δ did not coprecipitate with filamin A. Transfection with filamin A greatly enhanced coprecipitation with CaR as illustrated in Fig. 2B (all lanes except the wt lane to right of the vertical line were derived from cells cotransfected with filamin A). To determine whether high affinity interactions of CaR and filamin A (defined by stability during immunoprecipitation) are dependent upon receptor activation, filamin A was immunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cells (expressing either wtCaR or CaR972Δ) that had been exposed to either 0.5 or 5 mm extracellular Ca2+ for 10 min. Western blots of the immunoprecipitated proteins were probed for the presence of CaR with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, wtCaR was robustly immunoprecipitated with filamin A from cells exposed to 5 mm Ca2+ and weakly immunoprecipitated at 0.5 mm Ca2+. CaR972Δ did not coimmunoprecipitate with filamin A at either 0.5 or 5 mm Ca2+. These results suggest that CaR activation facilitates high affinity interactions with filamin A. The results of Fig. 2B suggest that CaR carboxyl-terminal residues 972–997 contain all or part of the site for high affinity interactions of CaR with filamin A, i.e. interactions that are stable during immunoprecipitation. Secondary structure analysis of the CaR carboxyl terminus suggests the presence of two β-strands from residues 962 to 981, which include the initial portion of the putative filamin A interaction domain (residues 972–997). We tested whether deletion of the two β-strands (residues 962–981, termed CaR962Δ) would influence filamin A binding. Fig. 2A illustrates the location of the putative β-strands (indicated by white arrows), the second strand (from 972 to 979) overlaps the initial portion of the region identified from Y2H studies as part of the high affinity filamin A interaction domain (4Awata H.

Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34880-34887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cells transiently transfected with CaR962Δ were treated with 0.5 or 5 mm Ca2+ for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-filamin A antibody. Western blots were probed with anti-FLAG antibodies and as illustrated in Fig. 2C; only wtCaR at 5 mm Ca2+ had high affinity interactions with filamin A. To confirm the specificity of the β-strand region (residues 962–981) in high affinity CaR interactions with filamin A, we generated additional deletion constructs of the carboxyl terminus including deletion of the α-helix involved in G protein signaling (residues 870–879, termed 870Δ), and deletion of a predicted disordered region between the proximal α-helix and the filamin A binding domain (residues 909–960, termed 909Δ). The deletion constructs (962Δ, 870Δ, and 909Δ) or wtCaR were transfected in HEK-293 cells. Cells were exposed to 5 mm Ca2+ for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by immunoprecipitation of filamin A; Western blots were probed with anti-FLAG antibody to assess the presence of CaR. As illustrated in Fig. 2D, CaR coprecipitated with filamin A when the CaR deletion mutants contained the β-strand region from residues 962 to 981 (wtCaR, 909Δ, and 870Δ), despite the significant changes to the CaR carboxyl terminus, i.e. deletion 909Δ removed 51 amino acids. In contrast, the CaR deletion that removed the β-strand region from residues 962 to 981 did not coprecipitate with filamin A, strongly suggesting that high affinity interactions between CaR and filamin A are specific and mediated by the β-strand region. ERK1/2∼P Does Not Require High Affinity Interaction of CaR with Filamin A—Filamin A is required for CaR-mediated activation of ERK1/2∼P. To determine whether the high affinity interaction between CaR and filamin A is required for activation of the MAPK pathway, we compared the abilities of CaR carboxyl-terminal truncations (Fig. 2A) and CaR972Δ to stimulate ERK1/2∼P. All of the truncations and the deletion constructs were expressed in HEK-293 cells and stimulated with 5 mm Ca2+ for 10 min. As shown in the experiment in Fig. 3A, the CaR truncations and CaR972Δ exhibit a graded ability to stimulate ERK1/2∼P. Most surprisingly, truncations that eliminate the high affinity filamin A interaction domain (CaRΔ886 and CaRΔ908) as well as the deletion CaR972Δ"
https://openalex.org/W2058446794,"Mutational defects in fibrillin-rich microfibrils give rise to a number of heritable connective tissue disorders, generally termed microfibrillopathies. To understand the pathogenesis of these microfibrillopathies, it is important to elucidate the supramolecular composition of microfibrils and their interaction properties with extracellular matrix components. Here we demonstrate that the proteoglycan perlecan is an associated component of microfibrils typically close to basement membrane zones. Double immunofluorescence studies demonstrate colocalization of fibrillin-1, the major backbone component of microfibrils, with perlecan in fibroblast cultures as well as in dermal and ocular tissues. Double immunogold labeling further confirms colocalization of perlecan to microfibrils in various tissues at the ultrastructural level. Extraction studies revealed that perlecan is not covalently associated with microfibrils. High affinity interactions between fibrillin-1 and perlecan were found by kinetic binding studies with dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range. A detailed mapping study of the interaction epitopes by solid phase binding assays primarily revealed interactions of perlecan domains I and II with a central region of fibrillin-1. Analysis of perlecan null embryos showed less microfibrils at the dermal-epidermal junction as compared with wild-type littermates. The data presented indicate a functional significance for perlecan in anchoring microfibrils to basement membranes and in the biogenesis of microfibrils."

In eukaryotes, it is generated in the endoplasmic reticulum by post-translational modification of a conserved cysteine residue. The FGly-generating enzyme (FGE), performing this modification, is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident enzyme that upon overexpression is secreted. Recombinant FGE was purified from cells and secretions to homogeneity. Intracellular FGE contains a high mannose type N-glycan, which is processed to the complex type in secreted FGE. Secreted FGE shows partial N-terminal trimming up to residue 73 without loosing catalytic activity. FGE is a calcium-binding protein containing an N-terminal (residues 86–168) and a C-terminal (residues 178–374) protease-resistant domain. The latter is stabilized by three disulfide bridges arranged in a clamp-like manner, which links the third to the eighth, the fourth to the seventh, and the fifth to the sixth cysteine residue. The innermost cysteine pair is partially reduced. The first two cysteine residues are located in the sequence preceding the N-terminal protease-resistant domain. They can form intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bonds, the latter stabilizing homodimers. The C-terminal domain comprises the substrate binding site, as evidenced by yeast two-hybrid interaction assays and photocross-linking of a substrate peptide to proline 182.

In eukaryotes, FGly formation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is a late cotranslational or early posttranslational oxidation of a specific cysteine residue (5Dierks T.

This oxidation is directed by a conserved sequence motif downstream of the cysteine to be modified (CXPSRXXX(L/M)TG(R/K/L) in human sulfatases, see Ref. 17Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P.

In vitro FGly formation can be measured using sulfatase-derived synthetic peptides as substrates that show a high affinity toward FGE. These peptides, in modified form, could also be used to construct an affinity matrix that allowed purification of FGE from bovine testis, leading to its identification as a single 374-amino acid glycoprotein responsible for FGly generation (14Dierks T.

Expression of FGE in MSD patient cells led to reconstitution of sulfatase activities in these cells (13Cosma M.P. Pepe S. Annunziata I. Trott D.A. Parenti G. Ballabio A.

FGE defines a new enzyme family capable of performing an oxidation reaction without any obvious requirement for a cofactor and most likely using molecular oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. 3J.

Dierks, unpublished data. How oxygen-dependent cysteine oxidation is facilitated in the ER remains unclear, even though the crystal structures of two other cysteine-oxygen oxidoreductases have been solved (19Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Gross E. Kastner D.B. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Cell. 2004; 117: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These oxidoreductases, Erv2p and Ero1p, contain FAD and are unrelated to FGE on the primary sequence level. For Ero1p, which is the protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI)-oxidizing enzyme and hence the primary source of disulfides in the ER, specific cysteine residues have been implicated in redox catalysis. Also for FGE cysteines have been speculated to play an essential role for catalysis (18Landgrebe J. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 316: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To comprehend these fundamental redox mechanisms, detailed functional and structural information of the involved oxygen-utilizing oxidases is required. Here we describe functional and structural properties of human FGE allowing the depiction of a first model of its molecular architecture and its substrate binding site.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Expression Plasmids—A pMPSVEH plasmid, containing an FGE-RGS-His6-encoding cDNA insert (see Ref. 14Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A. Mariappan M. von Figura K. Cell. 2003; 113: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), served as template for an add-on PCR reaction using FGE_SP_EcoRI (gGAATTCgggacaacATGGCTGCG) and FGE-His_XbaInc (gcTCTAGAttaGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGC) as forward and reverse primers, thereby adding a 5′-EcoRI and a 3′-XbaI site to the cDNA. The PCR product was cut with EcoRI, blunted with Klenow polymerase and then cut with XbaI. After purification, it was cloned into the pSB4.7pA expression vector, provided by Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. (Cambridge, MA), downstream of its CMV promotor using the BamHI (5′), blunted with Klenow polymerase, and the XbaI (3′) sites.For construction of a cDNA encoding FGEΔ34–68-His, a BspEI site was added 5′ of codon 69 (primer FGE_BspEI, aatgcggcTCCGGAcCGATACTCGCGGGAGG), and an EcoRI site at the 3′-end of the FGE-RGS-His6-encoding cDNA (see above). The resulting product was cloned as a BspEI/EcoRI fragment into plasmid pTD17 (5Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in-frame with the signal peptide of preprolactin. The resulting plasmid pTD101 was used as a template for a second add-on PCR adding a BamHI site to the 5′-end (primer ppl_BamHI, cgGGATCCgccaccATGGACAGCAAAGGTTCG) and an XbaI site to the 3′-end (primer FGE-His_XbaInc, see above). Because of an endogenous BamHI site in the coding region the resulting PCR product had to be cloned in two steps into pSB4.7pA. First the 162-bp 3′-BamHI/XbaI fragment was inserted into the corresponding sites of the vector and then the remaining 908-bp 5′ BamHI fragment. The resulting construct with correct orientation of the BamHI fragment encodes a fusion protein consisting of the preprolactin signal peptide and mature FGE-His with a deletion of residues 34–68. All PCR reactions were performed using Pfu-Ultra polymerase (Stratagene). The resulting constructs were fully sequenced to preclude any sequence error.Cell Culture and Protein Expression—HT1080 cells and human skin fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection of HT1080 cells with pSB4.7pA-plasmids (see above) was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 following the protocol recommended by Invitrogen. After growth for 2 weeks in medium containing genticin (G418 sulfate, Invitrogen) with increasing concentrations from 200 to 800 μg/ml, drug-resistant cells were cloned and expanded in growth medium containing genticin (800 μg/ml). Clones were screened by Western blot analysis for expression of FGE protein.Purification of Recombinant FGE-His—HT1080 cells stably overexpressing FGE-His were grown to near confluence in normal growth medium. Medium was collected every 48 h, cleared by spinning at 1,100 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (50% w/v). The precipitate obtained from 4 liters of medium was resuspended in 35 ml of buffer I (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm sodium chloride, pH 8.0) and dialyzed two times for 8–12 h at 4 °C against buffer I. The dialysate was cleared by centrifugation and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 25 ml of Ni-NTA agarose (50% suspension, Qiagen). The agarose was washed with 12 column volumes of 25 mm imidazole in buffer I. FGE-His6 was eluted three times with 15 ml of buffer I containing 100 mm imidazole and another time with 15 ml of 250 mm imidazole in buffer I (each time incubating the Ni-NTA agarose for 20 min at 4 °C). The elution fractions were pooled and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 35 ml of Affi-Gel 10, substituted with ASA-C69S-(65–80) peptide (see Ref. 14Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A. Mariappan M. von Figura K. Cell. 2003; 113: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), that had been equilibrated with PBS. After binding, the Affi-Gel was washed six times with 50 ml of 2 m sodium chloride in buffer II (10 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml amino acid mix (0.05 mg/ml of each amino acid), pH 8.0) and again with 50 ml of buffer II. Elution was carried out as follows. The Affi-Gel was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 35 ml of buffer II containing 300 mm KCl and 200 μm ASA-C69S-(65–80) peptide. Afterwards the Affi-Gel was washed with 35 ml of the same buffer without peptide. This procedure was repeated two times. The elution fractions were pooled, concentrated to a volume of about 500 μl using an Ultra Thimble 100/25 (MWCO 25 kDa, Schleicher & Schuell, Germany), and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm DTT, pH 8.0.For purification of intracellular FGE-His, stably overexpressing HT1080 cells (fifteen 150-mm dishes) grown to confluency were harvested with trypsin and extracted by sonication in denaturation buffer B (The QIAexpressionist, Qiagen). The extract was used for non-native purification of FGE-His on 0.8-ml Ni2+-NTA agarose according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen) using Qiagen buffers B, C, and E for binding, washing, and elution. Eluate fractions were pooled and loaded on a C4 reversed-phase column (Aquapore BU-300 7 microns, 20 × 2.1 mm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) pre-equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water. Proteins were eluted with a gradient from 0–90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1.5% per min). Peak fractions were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting.Treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)—HT1080 cells, stably expressing FGE-His or FGEΔ34–68-His were grown to near confluency. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with 10 mm NEM (Fluka)/PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. Controls were incubated with PBS without NEM. After trypsinization, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and lysed in PBS containing 10 mm NEM. Protein concentration of cell extracts was determined by Bradford's reagent (Bio-Rad). For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of proteins were applied for SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions (with and without 5% mercaptoethanol), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti His tag monoclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody as primary and secondary antibody, respectively.EndoH/PNGase Treatment—HT1080 cells stably expressing FGE-His were grown to confluency. After 48 h in fresh medium, cells and medium were collected for partial purification of FGE-His by chromatography on Ni-NTA agarose under native conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Instead of using imidazole, protein was eluted by boiling the Ni-agarose beads in 0.1% SDS/0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min. The eluate was used for PNGase (with addition of Triton X-100) and EndoH treatment as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science).FGE Activity Assays and Western Blotting—Activity assays of FGE were performed as described earlier using the synthetic ASA-derived peptide P23 as substrate (14Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A. Mariappan M. von Figura K. Cell. 2003; 113: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Corresponding 23-mer peptides derived from the remaining 15 other human sulfatases were synthesized (see “Results” and Table I) and purified. The turnover of all peptides was assayed at 200 nm substrate concentration under conditions that led to 50% turnover of P23 in 30 min at 37 °C.Table IFGE-mediated turnover of peptides derived from human sulfatasesPeptideSequenceFGly modificationpmol/h%ASA-F59M-(59-80)aASA-ASG, arylsulfatase A-G.

Open table in a new tab For Western blot analysis a monoclonal anti RGS(His6) antibody (Qiagen) or polyclonal antibodies, raised against purified FGE-His in rabbits, were used as primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Western blot signals were quantified using the AIDA 2.1 software package (Raytest).Dependence of FGE Activity on Metal Ions—FGE-His6 (∼300 μg of protein purified from secretions) was incubated for 1 h on ice in the presence of each 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA. Small compounds were then removed by gel filtration on a Fast Desalting PC 3.2/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 in the absence of DTT. Eluted FGE-His6 was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 150 ml of the same buffer. FGE-His6 free of divalent metal ions was shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. FGE activity assays were carried out as described earlier (14Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A. Mariappan M. von Figura K. Cell. 2003; 113: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) except that the routinely present 15 μm CaCl2 were replaced by 0–150 μm of either CaCl2 or CuCl2 (final concentration). FGE-His6 was used at 2.3 nm final concentration.Limited Proteolysis—FGE-His purified from the secretion of HT1080 cells was treated with thermolysin or elastase in phosphate-buffered saline at a protein to protease ratio of 100:1 (w/w) for up to 24 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heating at 95 °C. The digests were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. For N-terminal sequencing, the proteolytic fragments were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Germany), stained with Coomassie Blue, excised from the membrane and subjected to Edman degradation on a Procise cLC sequenator (Applied Biosystems).Reductive Carbamidomethylation and Tryptic Digestion—Purified FGE-His (20–200 μg) was dried, solubilized in 45 μl of 8 m urea, 0.4 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.6 (buffer U), and reduced with 5 μlof100 mm DTT in buffer U at 56 °C for 1 h. Cysteines were carbamidomethylated by incubation with 5 μl of 300 mm iodoacetamide in buffer U in the dark at 25 °C for 30 min. Reduction and carbamidomethylation were repeated (adding 7.5 μl of 100 mm DTT and 5 μl of 300 mm iodoacetamide, respectively) and the excess of iodoacetamide quenched with 2.5 μl of 100 mm DTT. The pH was adjusted to about 2 by adding 130 μl2% trifluoroacetic acid/water, and the enzyme was purified on a C4 reversed-phase column (Aquapore BU-300 7-micron 20 × 2.1 mm) applying a 0–90% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1.5% per min). The FGE-His containing fraction was lyophilized, solubilized in 25 μl buffer U, diluted to 100 μl with water, and digested with trypsin (2% w/w) at 37 °C overnight. For the identification of disulfide bridges, reduction and carbamidomethylation were omitted, and native FGE was directly digested with trypsin (at 10% w/w). After digestion the peptides were purified in aliquots, corresponding to 20 μg of FGE, on a microbore C18 reverse phase column (C18 PepMap100 1 × 150 mm, Dionex) applying a 0–63% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1.0% per min). All reverse phase purifications were performed on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences).MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and Edman Sequencing—For the analysis of cysteine modifications, disulfide bridges and the oligosaccharide side chain structure, tryptic peptides of FGE-His were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using a Reflex III instrument (Bruker Daltonik, Germany) and dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix. The identity of cysteine or oligosaccharide-containing peptides was verified by Edman sequencing (Procise cLC, Applied Biosystems), allowing also quantification of peptides. For MALDI LIFT-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry see “Photocross-linking.”Metal Content of Purified FGE-His Protein—Duplicates (0.75 mg each) of FGE-His protein, purified from HT1080 secretions, was used at 407 μm concentration in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm DTT (pH 8.0) for plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A buffer sample served as blank. The analysis was performed by Dr. H. Baumann at the Spurenanalytisches Laboratorium, Maxhütte-Haidhof, Germany. The method allows quantitative or semi-quantitative detection of 41 different metals with detection limits of 0.02–0.1 ppm.Photocross-linking—For photoaffinity labeling, six p-benzoyl phenylalanine (Bpa)-containing peptides were synthesized corresponding to residues 60–80 of arylsulfatase A (ASA) with an additional ϵ-biotinylated lysine residue at the N terminus and an additional serine amide at the C terminus. The Bpa residue replaced either phenylalanine 62, valine 66, or leucine 77 in the ASA sequence. Each of the peptides was synthesized with a cysteine (wild-type) or an alanine (C69A) residue in position 69. Cross-linking was carried out in PBS in a final volume of 50 μl. 1 mm stock solutions of the Bpa-containing P23 peptides were prepared in 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. FGE-His6 (final concentration 1 μm) was incubated for 5 min on ice with a 50-fold molar excess of the respective Bpa peptide. Then the mixture was irradiated with UV-light (400 watt metal vapor lamp, Ultratech, Osram, Germany) on ice for 30 min. To avoid photodamage of the protein UV light with wavelengths below 300 nm was filtered out by a special glass filter plate (B270, Schott, Germany) (21Jahn O. Eckart K. Tezval H. Spiess J. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2004; 378: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Jahn O. Eckart K. Brauns O. Tezval H. Spiess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12055-12060Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The photoadducts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-RGS-His6 or anti-biotin monoclonal antibodies as primary antibodies and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody as secondary antibody.For determination of the cross-link site, FGE was reacted with peptide P23-Bpa77 on a preparative scale. 64 μg of FGE were cross-linked with P23-Bpa77 in four aliquots (each in 400 μl) under the conditions described for the analytical scale. Thereafter, aliquots were pooled and lyophilized. Reductive carbamidomethylation, separation on a C4 column, tryptic digestion, peptide purification and analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS and Edman sequencing were performed as described above. MALDI LIFT-TOF/TOF analysis of the metastable fragments of the cross-linked peptide (CLP) was performed on an Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltoniks) using Biotools (Bruker Daltoniks) for evaluation of the fragment spectra. To increase fragmentation in the C-terminal part of CLP, a truncated form was generated by treatment with proteinase K. 3 pmol of CLP were incubated with 1 ng of proteinase K in 2 μl of 25 mm NH2HCO3 at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopp"

It is suggested that PAX6 involves corneal epithelium lineage-specific differentiation (Liu, J. J., Kao, W. W., and Wilson, S. E. (1999) Exp. Eye Res. 68, 295–301); however, the regulatory mechanism and function of Pax6 in growth factor-induced corneal epithelial responses is still unknown. In the present study, we found that the mitogenic effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in corneal epithelial cells required suppression of PAX6 activity through cellular mechanisms involving Erk-signaling pathway-mediated increase in CTCF expression. EGF-induced CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) activation subsequently inhibited Pax6 expression by interacting with a CTCF-specific region upstream of the pax6 P0 promoter. Suppression of EGF-induced Erk activation by specific inhibitor or by the dominant expression of a silent Erk mutant effectively abolished the effects of EGF stimulation on regulations of CTCF and pax6. Apparently, down-regulation of Pax6 expression induced by EGF is required for corneal epithelial proliferation, because overexpression of pax6 in these cells attenuated EGF-induced proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of mRNA expression with pax6- or CTCF-specific small interfering RNA in corneal epithelial cells significantly promoted or attenuated EGF-induced proliferation, respectively. Thus, our results revealed a new regulatory mechanism that involves cellular signaling events and pax6 transcription regulation in growth factor-mediated proliferation.

The basal layer cells must proliferate at a fast rate to replace terminally differentiated cells in the more superficial layers and to maintain this protective function. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HCE, human corneal epithelial; RCE, rabbit corneal epithelial; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; tet, tetracycline; CTCF, CCCTC binding factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA. is found to have stimulatory effects on corneal epithelial cell proliferation and migration (3.Tao W. Liou G.I. Wu X. Abney T.O. Reinach P.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 2614-2622PubMed Google Scholar). In wound healing models employing cultured corneal epithelial cells, the healing rate can be tremendously enhanced by an optimal dose of EGF present in the medium (4.Kang S.J. Kim E.K. Kim H.B. Ophthalmologica. 1999; 213: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). EGF receptor-linked cell signaling in corneal epithelial cells includes pathways involving stimulation of phospholipase C, D, protein kinase A, phospholipase A2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and limbs of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (5.Zhang Y.

Reinach P.S. Lu L. Curr. Eye Res. 2001; 23: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Application of EGF in the serum starvation-synchronized corneal epithelial cells induces the formation of EGF receptor clusters in the cell membrane and increases cell proliferation by promoting cells entering S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (12.Kang S.S.

Biol. 2003; 196: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The proliferative effect of EGF on corneal epithelial cell growth is a complex process including activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase limb of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and stimulation of voltage-gated K+ channels and bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporters (11.Kang S.S.

However, the regulatory mechanism for the cell fade and mitogenic response to this cytokine still remains to be further investigated. Pax6 plays a critical and evolutionarily conserved role in determining early stage cell differentiation in eye development in both vertebrates and invertebrates (17.Gehring W.J. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 18.Gehring W.J. Ikeo K. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 371-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutation of eyeless, homologue of the pax6 gene, results in missing eye structures in Drosophila (19.Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Science. 1994; 265: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Overexpression of pax6 can induce fully differentiated ectopic eyes and ectopic expressions of early eye development genes, such as Otx2, Rx, and Six3, as well as the endogenous pax6 (17.Gehring W.J. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 20.Underhill D.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21.Altmann C.R. Chow R.L.

In addition, specific mutation of pax6 causes a small eye (Sey) defect in mice and ocular aniridia in humans (22.Hill R.E. Favor J. Hogan B.L. Ton C.C. Saunders G.F. Hanson I.M. Prosser J. Jordan T.

The Pax6 gene is expressed in essentially all ocular structures of vertebrates, including the cornea, iris, lens, and retina (25.Oliw E.H. Prostaglandins. 1987; 34: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 26.Martin P. Carriere C. Dozier C. Quatannens B. Mirabel M.A. Vandenbunder B. Stehelin D. Saule S.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5082-5094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deficient expression of the pax6 gene causes death in mice shortly after birth. Although pax6 is down-regulated or fades away in most tissues and cell types following differentiation, it remains detectable in several mature cell types of the eye, including corneal, epithelial, lenticular, and retinal (29.MacDonald R. Scholes J. Strahle U. Brennan C. Holder N. Brand M. Wilson S.W. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the developed cornea, PAX6 is a positive transcription factor essential for controlling the transcription of the cornea-specific differentiation marker keratin 12, suggesting that Pax6 may play an important role in early differentiation and maintaining a differentiation pattern in these cells (30.Shiraishi A. Converse R.L. Liu C.Y. Zhou F. Kao C.W. Kao W.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2554-2561PubMed Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanisms of Pax6 gene expression are still largely unknown. It is apparently regulated by at least two enhancers. One has been identified as a 341-base pair enhancer located in the 5′ region 4.2 kb upstream of the pax6 gene (31.Williams S.C. Altmann C.R. Chow R.L. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Lang R.A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This enhancer is highly conserved in the Pax6 gene of mouse, humans, and puffer fish (Fugu) (31.Williams S.C. Altmann C.R. Chow R.L. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Lang R.A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32.Kammandel B. Chowdhury K. Stoykova A. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Gruss P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 79-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This enhancer is a dominant factor in the preplacodal phase of Pax6 expression and designated as the Pax6 ectoderm enhancer, whereas the existence of the other (enhancer 2) is implied. Recently, studies in our laboratory revealed that a repressor element is located at ∼1.2 kb upstream from the pax6 P0 promoter in mouse. The repressor element contains five repeat binding sites in the 80-bp region for CTCF, a transcription factor binding to the CCCTC DNA sequence (33.Li T. Lu Z. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27575-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Over-expression of the CTCF gene in corneal cells induces a decrease of pax6 P0 activity, and a deletion mutant of the CTCF binding sequence attenuated the decrease, indicating that CTCF serves as a repressive protein in pax6 gene expression (33.Li T. Lu Z. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27575-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this report, we present important results to demonstrate that the mitogenic effect of EGF in corneal epithelial cells requires suppression of PAX6 activity. The effect of EGF on the suppression of pax6 expression is through Erk-signaling pathway-mediated activation of CTCF. EGF-induced activation of Erk cascades resulting in increases in CTCF expression subsequently inhibited pax6 transcription. Overexpression of pax6 attenuated EGF-stimulated corneal epithelial proliferation, suggesting that inhibition of pax6 expression is a prerequisite for EGF to elicit control of cell growth and fate. In addition, our results revealed new regulatory mechanisms in corneal epithelial cells involving the EGF receptor-linked mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and transcription control of Pax6 function in growth factor-stimulated proliferation. Cell Culture and Gene Transfection—Human and rabbit corneal epithelial (HCE and RCE, respectively) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma) in a 37 °C incubator gassed with 5% CO2. Before the experiments, both cells were synchronized at G1 phase of the cell cycle by depriving serum from the culture medium for at least 24 h. Human hematopoietic myeloblast ML-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 37 °C incubator gassed with 5% CO2. Pax6 P0 reporter constructs and full-length cDNAs encoding the CTCF gene and the dominant negative Erk1 gene were transfected into RCE cells by electroporation. The cells were washed twice and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with a density of 107/ml on ice for 5 min. Cells in 0.8 ml of PBS containing 5 μg of constructed DNAs were transferred into a 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette. An ECM® 630 electroporator (Genetronic, Inc.) was used with a pulse protocol using 300-V, 100-ohm, and 500-microcoulomb settings. Electroporated cells were transferred into 10 ml of normal culture medium prewarmed at 37 °C and cultured in an incubator at 37 °C. Northern Blot Experiments—Total RNAs were extracted with a guanidine thiocyanate procedure (34.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar, 35.Wang Y. Gong B. Dai W. Lu L. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were collected and rinsed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were immediately lysed with 1 ml of guanidium solution (5 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Lysates were extracted three times with 50:50 phenol:chloroform. Finally, RNAs were precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 revolutions/min for 15 min after preincubation with ethanol at -80 °C. RNA (20 μg) for each sample was loaded in 1% agarose gel denatured with 2.2 m formaldehyde. The fractionated RNA was transferred onto nylon membrane. The membrane was subsequently hybridized with the corresponding α-32P-labeled DNA probe using a Random Primer labeling kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Signals in the membrane were visualized by exposure to x-ray film at -80 °C overnight or longer. Western Analysis Experiments—Western blot experiments were performed as described previously (36.Wang L. Xu D. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3678-3685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 106 cells were rinsed twice with PBS and harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Naorthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The cell lysates were denatured by adding equal volumes of 2× Laemmli buffer and by boiling for 5 min. Each sample with 20 μg of protein was electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-Pax6 or rabbit anti-Erk1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then incubated with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Signals in the membrane were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase blot detection kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All membranes were stripped following a standard stripping protocol. These membranes were rehybridized with mouse anti-β-actin and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies and visualized with the horseradish peroxidase blot detection kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocomplex Kinase Assays—To detect mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, cells were harvested as described above. Erk proteins in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-Erk antibody (1:100) at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes of protein and antibodies were washed twice with lysis buffer and then kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Immunocomplexes were resuspended in 100 μl of kinase buffer. Glutathione S-transferase/myelin basic protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a substrate for kinase activity assays. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 2 μl of ATP mixture containing 20 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was processed at room temperature for 5 min and terminated by adding 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was displayed by PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Analysis of β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) and Luciferase Activities—Pax6 P0 promoter and its mutant transfected cells were harvested for the Pax6 P0 promoter activity analysis in days 2 and 3 after transfection. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8. Cells were ruptured by three cycles of freeze/thaw. Cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were kept at -80 °C for later analysis of β-galactosidase activity. Galacton-star was used as a chemiluminescent substrate in a luminescent β-gal system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) for determination of β-galactosidase activity. Chemiluminescent signals from products of Galacton-star catalyzed by β-galactosidase were determined by a luminometer. An internal control vector (pBRL-TK, 0.2 μg/transfection, Invitrogen) was introduced into the cells in parallel with pax6 P0 reporters for normalization of lacZ activity. The luciferase activity was measured using an assay kit supplied by Invitrogen. MTT Cell Proliferation Assay—The MTT cell proliferation assay is a colorimetric assay system that measures the reduction of a tetrazolium component (MTT) into an insoluble formazan product by the mitochondria of viable cells. One hour prior to cell harvest, the culture medium was replaced with 1 ml of serum-free medium, and 100 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added into each of the wells and incubated in a CO2 incubator for 1 h. The medium was replaced by 0.4 ml of acidic isopropyl alcohol (0.04 m HCl in absolute isopropyl alcohol) to solubilize the colored crystals. MTT was changed to a blue color by mitochondrial dehydrogenase. The samples were read using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Labsystems Multiskan MCC/340, Fisher Scientific) at a wavelength of 570 nm, with the background subtraction at 650 nm. The amount of color produced, normalized with the background, is directly proportional to the number of viable cells and is represented as the proliferation index. Growth Factor-induced Increase in CTCF Expression and Decrease in pax6 Expression—The effects of serum containing growth factors on expressions of CTCF mRNA and PAX6 protein were tested by stimulating synchronized RCE and ML-1 cells with 7.5% fetal bovine serum for 6 h (Fig. 1A). Northern analysis revealed that the level of CTCF mRNA was increased in response to serum stimulation in both RCE and ML-1 cells. There was a decrease in Pax6 protein expression detected by Western analysis in RCE cells. However, Pax6 was not expressed in ML-1 cells. To further investigate the regulatory mechanism, the effect of EGF on CTCF and Pax6 activities was studied in RCE cells, because EGF is one of the important growth factors that promote corneal epithelial proliferation. The dose-response relationship and time course of EGF-stimulated increases in CTCF mRNA expression were determined in RCE cells by Northern analysis (Fig. 1, B and C, upper panels). Normalized density analyses obtained from three independent experiments were plotted to demonstrate the statistical significant difference, p < 0.05 (Fig. 1, B and C, lower panels). Expression of CTCF apparently increased in response to 10 ng/ml EGF stimulation at 3 h and reached the peak level at 12 h. On the other hand, control experiments detected a high expression level of basal pax6 protein in RCE cells using Western analysis. The effect of EGF on decrease in Pax6 expression demonstrated a dose-dependent pattern (Fig. 1D). Upon application of 10 ng/ml EGF, Pax6 expression was decreased following a time course and reached a very low level at 12 h (Fig. 1E). Statistical analysis showed the significant difference in EGF-induced changes of Pax6 expression (n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, D and E, lower panels). These data suggest that there is a correlation between EGF-induced increase in CTCF expression and decrease in pax6 expression in RCE cells. This correlation is consistent with our previous report that CTCF can inhibit pax6 transcription by binding to a repressor element located upstream of the pax6 P0 promoter. Effect of EGF on Pax6 Promoter Activity—In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that CTCF suppresses P0 activity through interaction with a repressor element (CTCF binding sites) located in the region -1.2 kb upstream from the pax6 P0 promoter (33.Li T. Lu Z. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27575-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To verify whether EGF-induced decrease in Pax6 expression resulted from the increase in CTCF expression, the effect of EGF on Pax6 promoter activity was examined using the previously made P4.2 β-galactosidase reporter and an internal deletion mutant Pxba that lacks the binding sequences for CTCF (33.Li T. Lu Z. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27575-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These reporter constructs were transiently introduced by electroporation into RCE cells and a stable RCE cell line that was previously transfected with tetracycline (tet)-inducible CTCF cDNA for overexpression of CTCF. To test Pax6 P0 promoter activity, P4.2 and Pxba mutant-transfected cells were induced with 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Tet-induced overexpression of CTCF markedly inhibited P4.2 promoter activity but did not affect Pxba mutant promoter activity (Fig. 2A). The effect of EGF on pax6 P0 promoter activity was also investigated in RCE cells that were transiently transfected with P4.2 and Pxba mutant reporters. EGF stimulation significantly inhibited P4.2 reporter activity but had no effect on Pxba mutant reporter activity, as the binding sequence for CTCF in the mutant reporter had been deleted (Fig. 2B). The inhibitory effect of EGF on the pax6 P0 promoter was rather specific, because there were no changes in β-galactosidase activity in RCE cells transfected with cytomegalovirus-β-gal control vector. The results indicate that EGF inhibits pax6 P0 promoter activity through increase in CTCF activity in RCE cells. Effect of EGF-induced Erk Activation on CTCF and Pax6 Expression—Previous studies from our laboratory indicate that the Erk signaling pathway is one of the major EGF-induced signaling events responsible for RCE cell proliferation (11.Kang S.S. Li T. Xu D. Reinach P.S. Lu L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2164-2169PubMed Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of RCE cells with 10 ng/ml EGF, Erk activity was transiently increased within 24 h (Fig. 3A). EGF-induced effects on CTCF and PAX6 expressions were markedly affected by PD98059, which is a specific inhibitor for mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase immediately upstream from Erk in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (Fig. 3B). To further verify the effect of Erk on CTCF and PAX6 expressions, a tet-inducible dominant negative Erk construct was introduced into RCE cells. A RCE cell line with stable transfection of dominant negative Erk1 was established by double selections with blasticidin (2 μg/ml) and zeocin (50 μg/ml). Tet-induced increases in Erk1 protein expression were observed following an increased dose of tetracycline in RCE cells that were stably transfected with dominant negative Erk1 (pcDNA4-ErkDN) but not in control cells transfected with the pcDNA4 vector (Fig. 3C). EGF-induced Erk activity was measured in tet-induced and uninduced RCE cells with dominant negative Erk1 stable transfection by immunocomplex assay. Myelin basic fusion protein was used as a substrate. Induction of these cells with tetracycline (2 μg/ml) effectively blocked EGF-induced Erk activities (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, EGF induced a strong increase in CTCF expression and decrease in Pax6 expression. EGF-induced increase in CTCF expression and decrease in Pax6 expression were totally blocked by tet-induced overexpression of dominant negative Erk1 (Fig. 3, E and F). Results presented here provide further evidence in RCE cells that EGF-induced suppression of Pax6 expression is through activation of CTCF and that EGF-induced Erk signaling cascades play an important role in regulating CTCF activity. Functional Role of Pax6 in EGF-stimulated RCE Cell Proliferation—Functional role of PAX6 in EGF-induced RCE cell proliferation was studied by overexpression of the pax6 gene and by knockdown of Pax6 mRNA. RCE cell proliferation was determined by MTT and presented as the proliferation index. A cDNA fragment encoding the full-length human pax6 gene was subcloned into pcDNA4 vector that contains a cytomegalovirus promoter. The full-length human pax6 cDNA was transfected into RCE cells by electroporation. Western analysis of human pax6 cDNA-transfected cells revealed a new and larger molecular mass band (47 kDa) representing human PAX6 protein, but this band was absent in vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 4A). The other lower molecular mass band (43 kDa) was found in both human Pax6 cDNA- and vector-transfected cells, representing the endogenous rabbit PAX6 protein. Stimulation of EGF (10 ng/ml) induced a fast proliferation in days 2 and 3 in control RCE cells. However, the proliferative effect of EGF was significantly attenuated by overexpression of pax6 in human pax6 cDNA-transfected cells (n = 6, p < 0.05), suggesting that PAX6 plays a functional role in the inhibition of EGF-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 4B). In contrast, transfecting RCE cells with siRNA specific to the pax6 gene knocked down the endogenous pax6 mRNA (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, knockdown of Pax6 expression with siRNA significantly promoted RCE cell proliferation in the control cells and in EGF-stimulated RCE cells in days 2 and 3 (Fig. 4D). The effect of knocking down pax6 mRNA on cell proliferation was statistically significant (n = 6, p < 0.05). In addition, it resulted in the growing of RCE cells in the absence of EGF and even much faster growing in EGF-induced cells in days 2 and 3. Effect of Knocking Down CTCF mRNA on pax6 Expression and EGF-stimulated Proliferation—To further verify the functional role of CTCF in mediating EGF-induced alteration of pax6 transcription and RCE cell proliferation, CTCF activity in RCE cells was suppressed by knockdown of CTCF mRNA using CTCF-specific siRNA. As it has been shown in Fig. 1, EGF induced increases in CTCF expression and decreases in pax6 expression. However, EGF stimulation (20 ng/ml) failed to induce the increase in CTCF expression and decrease in pax6 expression in RCE cells that were transfected with CTCF-specific siRNA, (Fig. 5A). The effect of knocking down CTCF mRNA on CTCF and Pax6 expression were plotted as means with S.E. bars in Fig. 5, B and C, respectively. The significant difference was determined by analysis of variance (n = 3, p < 0.05). The effect of knocking down CTCF mRNA on EGF-induced RCE cell proliferation was also examined by MTT and presented as the proliferation index (Fig. 5D). Apparently, suppression of CTCF mRNA expression significantly inhibited RCE cell growth in both the absence and presence of EGF stimulation (n = 6, p < 0.05). Results from inhibition of CTCF mRNA expression experiments provide further evidence that EGF-induced RCE cell proliferation requires down-regulation of Pax6, and this action was mediated by CTCF. Corneal epithelial progenitor cells proliferate and differentiate to form the corneal epithelial layer by making spatial and temporal fate decisions. This renewal process maintains the healthy condition through a dynamic wound healing process. These processes are largely controlled by intercellular signal pathways through activation of growth factor receptors. Our data indicate that serum-containing growth factors, such as EGF, stimulate RCE cell growth by inhibiting Pax6 expression. It is consistent with previous reports that pax6 involves the lineage-specific differentiation by turning on the cornea-specific differentiation marker keratin 12 (1.Liu J.J. Kao W.W. Wilson S.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 68: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30.Shiraishi A. Converse R.L. Liu C.Y. Zhou F. Kao C.W. Kao W.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2554-2561PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrates, in Drosophila, that hyperactivation of Egfr, a homologue of the mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), induces inhibition of a pax6 homologue eyeless gene expression, resulting in an ectopic eye growing on an antenna (38.Gabay L. Seger R. Shilo B.Z. Science. 1997; 277: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). PAX6 plays a critical and evolutionarily conserved role in determining early stages of development. However, PAX6 is not expressed in most mature tissue types, except in the eye and pancreatic tissues. Up to now, it is still not clear what is the functional role of PAX6 during corneal epithelial proliferation/differentiation. In the present study, we aimed to determine the functional role of PAX6 in EGF-induced proliferation. Two parallel experiments were performed in RCE cells to manipulate Pax6 activities and to verify the effect of Pax6 on EGF-induced proliferation. First, PAX6 activity was altered by overexpression of the pax6 gene and by knockdown of pax6 mRNA. Second, pax6 transcription was altered by tet-inducible overexpression of CTCF and by knockdown of CTCF mRNA. We found that, in RCE cells, up-regulation of pax6 expression by overexpression of the human pax6 gene significantly suppressed EGF-induced proliferation on both days 2 and 3 (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, down-regulation of pax6 expression by the introduction of siRNA specific to the pax6 mRNA sequence into RCE cells significantly promoted EGF-induced cell proliferation on both days 2 and 3 (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, dominant expression of tet-inducible CTCF and knockdown of CTCF mRNA by siRNA resulted in down-regulation and up-regulation of Pax6 expression, respectively. Enhancement of pax6 expression by knockdown of CTCF mRNA effectively inhibited EGF-stimulated RCE cell proliferation. In conclusion, our results provide strong evidence that the regulation of pax6 in mature corneal tissue is closely related to growth factor-induced cell proliferation and differentiation, because: 1) pax6 expression was suppressed by EGF-induced cell proliferation, 2) alteration of CTCF activity resulted in decrease in pax6 transcription, and 3) alteration of PAX6 activity affected EGF-induced cell proliferation. These results indicate that, indeed, PAX6 is involved in EGF-induced corneal epithelial cell growth control. It is understandable that cell proliferation temporarily must suppress the machinery that links to cell differentiation. In this case, pax6 expression suppressed by EGF during growth factor-induced proliferation may play an important functional role by keeping proliferative cells in the cell cycle. Further studies are being performed to understand how pax6 is regulated and which signaling pathway is involved in regulating pax6 transcription. Our results indicate that EGF promotes corneal epithelial proliferation and induces suppression of pax6 expression. The effect of EGF on pax6 expression is closely associated with the increase in CTCF expression (Fig. 1). EGF stimulates pax6 P0 promoter activity, resulting in increases in β-gal expression of the pax6 reporter (P4.2 construct) in RCE cells. The mutant (Pxba) with an internal deletion of CTCF binding domain in the pax6 reporter abolished the effect of EGF on the pax6 P0 promoter (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with our previous studies that indicate there is a CTCF regulatory element (repressor) in this region upstream from the pax6 P0 promoter (33.Li T. Lu Z. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27575-27583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase, regulates cell growth and fate decisions of corneal epithelial cells (11.Kang S.S. Li T. Xu D. Reinach P.S. Lu L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2164-2169PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila, hyperactivation of Egfr induces an eye-to-antenna transformation and also an inhibition of eyeless gene expression (ey, homologue of the pax6 gene in Drosophila) (37.Kumar J.P. Moses K. Cell. 2001; 104: 687-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The role of Egfr in eye development of Drosophila is properly mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (38.Gabay L. Seger R. Shilo B.Z. Science. 1997; 277: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We have studied here the effect of EGF on RCE cell proliferation and differentiation by investigating EGFR-coupled signaling events and the regulation of related genes, including the pax6 gene. The effect of EGF-induced corneal epithelial cell growth is investigated by the detection of EGFR-linked Erk signaling cascades. EGF-induced increases in CTCF expression and decreases in Pax6 expression are mediated by the Erk signaling pathway in RCE cells (Fig. 3). Our conclusion is based on the following results. First, EGF-induced CTCF expression in RCE cells revealed a similar time course and dose-response relationship compared with its inhibitory effect on pax6 expression. Second, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (an immediate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase upstream from Erk) with PD98059 markedly blocked EGF-induced upregulation of CTCF expression and down-regulation of Pax6 expression. Finally, overexpression of the tet-inducible dominant negative Erk in transfected RCE cells effectively inhibited EGF-induced up-regulation of CTCF expression and down-regulation of pax6 expression. These results provide sufficient evidence that the regulatory effect of EGF on CTCF and subsequently on pax6 expression is through the EGFR-linked Erk signaling pathway. In summary, the present work, for the first time, demonstrates three important findings. First, EGF induces increases in CTCF expression in corneal epithelial cells through activation of the Erk signaling pathway. It is known that Erk nuclear translocation occurs after activation and regulates gene expressions, and it is possible that CTCF is one of those genes regulated by Erk. Second, EGF induces increases in CTCF expression to suppress pax6 expression by inhibition of pax6 transcription. The inhibitory effect of CTCF is accomplished by interaction with a specific DNA binding region in the pax6 P0 promoter. Finally, our data demonstrate that knockdown of pax6 expression promotes EGF-induced cell proliferation. In contrast, overexpression of pax6 expression attenuates the EGF effect on RCE cell proliferation, suggesting that PAX6 plays an important role in controlling growth factor-induced corneal epithelial cell growth. Apparently, EGF-induced RCE cell proliferation requires down-regulation of pax6 to prevent premature differentiation."

This reaction is activated by association of cytosolic factors, p47phox and p67phox, and a small G protein Rac with the membranous flavocytochrome b558. Another cytosolic factor, p40phox, is associated to the complex and is reported to play regulatory roles. Initiation of the NADPH oxidase activation cascade has been reported as consecutive to phosphorylation on serines 359/370 and 379 of the p47phox C terminus. These serines surround a polyproline motif that can interact with the Src homology 3 (SH3) module of p40phox (SH3p40) or the C-terminal SH3 of p67phox (C-SH3p67). The latter one presents a higher affinity in the resting state for p47phox. A change in SH3 binding preference following phosphorylation has been postulated earlier. Here we report the crystal structures of SH3p40 alone or in complex with a 12-residue proline-rich region of p47phox at 1.46 Å resolution. Using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements, we compared the affinity of the strict polyproline motif and the whole C terminus peptide with both SH3p40 and C-SH3p67. These data reveal that SH3p40 can interact with a consensus polyproline motif but also with a noncanonical motif of the p47phox C terminus. The electrostatic surfaces of both SH3 are very different, and therefore the binding preference for C-SH3p67 can be attributed to the polyproline motif recognition and particularly to the Arg-368p47 binding mode. The noncanonical motif contributes equally to interaction with both SH3. The influence of serine phosphorylation on residues 359/370 and 379 on the affinity for both SH3 domains has been checked. We conclude that contrarily to previous suggestions, phosphorylation of Ser-359/370 does not modify the SH3 binding affinity for both SH3, whereas phosphorylation of Ser-379 has a destabilizing effect on both interactions. Other mechanisms than a phosphorylation induced switch between the two SH3 must therefore take place for NADPH oxidase activation cascade to start.

The neutrophil NADPH oxidase is a central component of the nonspecific host resistance against microbial infection. The critical role of this enzyme is illustrated by a genetic disease, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), 1The abbreviations used are: CGD, chronic granulomatous disease; SH3, Src homology 3; PX, Phox homology; PB1, Phox-Bem1p homology; SH3p40, SH3 domain of p40phox; C-SH3p67, C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox; p47phox-Cter, p47phox C terminus (residues 358–390); polyProp47, polyproline motif of p47phox (residues 358–372); PDB, Protein Data Bank; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. in which mutations in genes coding for NADPH oxidase components impair the ability of the patient to fight against infection. The NADPH oxidase is composed of several proteins, a membrane-bound heterodimeric flavocytochrome b (gp91phox and p22phox), cytosolic proteins (p40phox, p47phox, p67phox), and a small GTP-binding protein (Rac1 or Rac2) (for review, see Ref. 1.Vignais P.V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to specific stimuli, activation of the enzyme takes place through multiple phosphorylation events of the cytosolic components (2.el Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol.

Phosphorylations rearrange the protein-protein interactions among the cytosolic proteins ending with their translocation, simultaneously with Rac-GTP, to the membrane embedded flavocytochrome b. The resulting activated complex catalyzes the electron transfer from NADPH to O2 leading to the production of superoxide anions, thus generating highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the phagocytic vacuole. For many years these ROS have been designated as the main actors in the neutrophil killing activity. Recent work suggests that in addition to its role in ROS formation, O2·¯ generation leads to phagosomal Cathepsin G and Elastase mobilization in the microbicidal process (6.Reeves E.P. Lu H.

The three cytosolic proteins p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox are modular proteins formed by various domains, such as SH3, PX, PB1, and TPR, usually found in signal transduction cascades. Numerous possible interactions within these proteins have been reported and are summarized in Fig. 1A. p47phox and p67phox are known to be essential for activation. In CGD patient lacking p47phox, p67phox is not translocated to the membrane. In contrast p67phox is not essential to p47phox translocation (7.Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In the activation process, p47phox is the sensor of the activation signal through multisite phosphorylations and secondly the scaffolding protein conducting translocation of the other cytosolic factors to the membrane component of the oxidase. p67phox is an activating factor in the electron transfer reaction (8.Nisimoto Y. Motalebi S. Han C.-H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast to p47phox and p67phox, nowadays no CGD related to p40phox is known. p40phox was first identified as a p67phox-associated protein in resting neutrophils (9.Someya A. Nagaoka I.

It has been postulated to modulate superoxide production, either positively (21.Tsunawaki S. Kagara S. Yoshikawa K. Yoshida L.S. Kuratsuji T. Namiki H. J. Exp.

In the last couple of years, an increasing body of structural and biochemical data shed light on the organization of the cytosolic complex in the resting state and on some events consecutive to p47phox phosphorylation. In the resting state p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox are thought to exist as a 1:1:1 ternary complex (27.Lapouge K. Smith S.J. Groemping Y. Rittinger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10121-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) as shown with purified proteins. Although p40phox and p67phox are both able to interact with the C-terminal polyproline region of p47phox, the p47phox/p67phox complex is favored (19.Grizot S. Grandvaux N. Fieschi F. Faure J.

A ternary complex can be achieved by the association of p40phox with p67phox (28.Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Mizuki K. Hata K. Ago T. Kitajima S. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) through their respective PB1 domain (20.Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H.

Cell. 2003; 11: 35-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that, in vivo, p47phox is dissociated from the p67phox/p40phox complex, as suggested previously (31.Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Activation initiated by the binding of chemotactic substances to neutrophil receptors leads, through signaling pathways, to primary phosphorylation of Ser-359 and/or Ser-370 of p47phox (5.Johnson J.L.

Additional phosphorylations can occur among the seven other C-terminal serines of p47phox. Among them, Ser-303, Ser-304, Ser-328, and Ser-379 have been identified as important for membrane translocation, interaction with p22phox, and the activation of the complex as shown by several mutagenesis studies (4.Inanami O.

From the resting to the activated state, p47phox is proposed to change from a closed to an open conformation where the PX domain is either masked by the internal C-terminal SH3 of p47phox or free for interaction with lipids of the membrane (34.Hiroaki H.

Williams R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition, the two p47phox-SH3 domains have been shown to be either buried or accessible to the p22phox polyproline (32.Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol.

Interactions with lipids and p22phox are believed to account for the association of p47phox with the membrane (37.Sumimoto H. Hata K. Mizuki K. Ito T. Kage Y. Sakaki Y. Fukumaki Y. Nakamura M.

Despite these new insights on p47phox, there is almost no information concerning the reorganization of p67phox and p40phox in the cytosolic complex upon phosphorylation. When examining the extended possibilities of interactions between cytosolic factors (Fig. 1A) and the limited panel of those present in the resting state (Fig. 1B), a rearrangement involving the three proteins has been suggested (24.Sathyamoorthy M. de Mendez I.

It has been proposed that the phosphorylation of p47phox could modulate its interaction with p67phox or p40phox, respectively (17.Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Faure J. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys.

To understand the structural rearrangements occurring upon activation, structural information on the effect of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated serines is needed. We addressed this question, characterizing at a molecular level the interaction of the SH3 domain of p40phox (SH3p40) with the polyproline region of p47phox. We report the three-dimensional structure of SH3p40 with and without the C-terminal polyproline of p47phox at 1.46 and 2 Å resolution, respectively. Comparison with the structure of the C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox (C-SH3p67) complexed to the p47phox C terminus (41.Kami K. Takeya R. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4268-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) highlights a strong difference between both SH3 domains. We compare the dissociation constants of both SH3p40 and C-SH3p67 with polyproline peptides by fluorometric techniques. The effect of phosphorylation on Ser-359, Ser-370, and Ser-379 on the binding of both SH3 toward p47phox is also investigated. SH3p40—A DNA fragment encoding the p40phox SH3 module, from Arg-174 to Lys-228, was amplified by PCR using the full-length p40phox sequence (31.Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as a template. The PCR fragment was cloned into the pCRscript Amp SK(+) cloning vector according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The resulting pCRscript-SH3p40 plasmid was cleaved with NdeI and XhoI and the 168-base fragment containing the SH3p40 sequence was subcloned in pIVEX 2.4 (Roche Applied Science). The resulting vector named pIVEX-SH3p40 was transformed and amplified in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain. The sequence of the construct was checked by sequencing. The His-SH3p40 was overexpressed as described for p40phox (19.Grizot S. Grandvaux N. Fieschi F. Faure J. Massenet C. Andrieu J.P. Fuchs A. Vignais P.V. Timmins P.A. Dagher M.C. Pebay-Peyroula E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3127-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After 3 h, cells were harvested and resuspended in chilled lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl supplemented with 40 mm imidazole and 5% glycerol). All of following operations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 40 min in a Beckman 45 Ti rotor. The supernatant was loaded at 2 ml/min on 4 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated in the previous buffer. Proteins were eluted with a 50-ml linear imidazole gradient (40–300 mm) at 2 ml/min. Fractions containing His-SH3p40 were pooled, concentrated to 6 mg/ml, and subjected to overnight digestion at 20 °C with 2.4 units of factor Xa/mg of protein in the presence of 2.5 mm CaCl2. Digestion products were loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto the Hiload 16/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The resulting protein fractions containing SH3p40 were concentrated to 14 mg/ml. The final recombinant protein comprised 5 N-terminal residues (LIKHM) from the previous linker, as determined by N-terminal sequencing. C-SH3p67—The sequence encoding residus 455–516, the C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox (C-SH3p67), was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET15b (Novagen). The sequence of the resulting vector named, pET-CSH3p67, was checked by sequencing. The protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain and first enriched by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (20–300 mm). The His tag was cleaved with thrombin (Sigma) overnight at 20 °C with 2.4 units thrombin/mg of protein, and further purification was carried out by gel filtration on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The peptide KPQPAVPPRPSAD (residues 360–372 of p47phox) was synthesized using conventional technology. The peptide was purified by HPLC using a C18 column and a linear gradient of 5–60% CH3CN in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide was lyophilized prior to resuspension in water (50 mg/ml) for crystallization. Peptide concentration was determined by amino acids analysis. The six other peptides were synthesized by Neosystem (Table II). They were repurified by HPLC using a C18 column and a linear gradient of 5–60% CH3CN in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purity of the peptides was higher than 95%.Table IIDissociation constants comparison of p47phox C-terminal peptides towards SH3p40 and C-SH3p67p47phox peptidesSH3p40C-SH3p67Kdp40/Kdp67p40phoxp67phoxμmμmμmμmp47phox (1-390)2505aFrom Ref. 19.,bFrom Ref. 27.0.02bFrom Ref. 27.PolyProp47 (358-372) 1.

Open table in a new tab Fluorescence measurements were performed at 20 °C in a Fluoromax (Jobin-Yvon) spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was set at 290 nm, and the fluorescence emission was recorded between 295 and 450 nm. Increasing amounts of peptide were added to a fluorescence cuvette containing 100 μl of a SH3p40 solution. The resulting shift of maximal emission wavelength (Δλ) was monitored over a large range of p47phox peptide concentration. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd value) characterizing the SH3/polyproline interaction was determined according to Equation 1 under the assumption that the fluorescence shift Δλ was proportional to the concentration of the SH3/polyproline complex. Considering Δλ = Δλmax([exp]/[SH3t]), Kd=[SH3t](ΔλΔλmax−1)+[pept](ΔλmaxΔλ−1) (Eq. 1) where [SH3t] = total SH3p40phox concentration, [pept] = total peptide concentration, [cpx] = complex concentration, Δλ = λSH3 – λ, and Δλmax = λSH3 – λcpx. Crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions. The best diffracting crystals of free SH3p40 were obtained at 14 °C from a protein solution at 14 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and a reservoir solution containing 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 40% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000. Crystals grew up within 2 months. Crystals of SH3p40/polyProp47 were grown at 20 °C with a reservoir containing 100 mm sodium citrate/citric acid, pH 5, 2.4 m ammonium sulfate. To obtain the complex, SH3p40 at 14 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl was mixed at 1:5 molar ratio to the polyproline peptide solution (50 mg/ml in water). This ratio was determined from the dissociation constant extrapolated from fluorescence measurements and corresponds to the presence of roughly 90% complexed SH3p40/polyProp47. Crystals were obtained within two or 3 weeks. Their size and quality were improved by macro-seeding with a reservoir solution containing 100 mm citrate/citric acid, pH 5, and 2.2 m ammonium sulfate to a final size of 200 × 50 × 20 μm. Prior to x-ray diffraction experiments crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Free SH3p40 crystals were frozen directly from the mother liquor and SH3p40/polyProp47 crystals were soaked in a cryo-buffer (reservoir solution containing 15% glycerol) prior to freezing. Free SH3p40—Free SH3p40 crystals cooled at 100 K diffracted to 2 Å on a rotating anode (Nonius) using a MARCCD detector (Mar 345, X-ray Research). Crystals diffracted anisotropically and were highly mosaic; several crystals were screened to obtain the best diffracting crystal. Data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (42.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and reduced with the CCP4 package (43.Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The space group is pseudo-orthorhombic and Rsym values are 11.5 and 10.8% in C2221 or P21 space groups, respectively. The structure of SH3p40 was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (44.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The search model was a superposition of eight SH3 structures: SEM (PDB code 1SEM), spectrin (PDB code 1SHG), tyrosine kinase Abl (PDB code 1ABQ), tyrosine kinase Fyn (PDB code 1FYN), Eps8 (PDB code 1I0C), Crk (PDB code 1B07), amphiphysin 2 (PDB code 1BB9), Hck (PDB code 1BU1), restricted to main chain atoms. These SH3 domains share 38, 33, 15, 20, 22, 24, 22, and 18% sequence identity with SH3p40, respectively. Molecular replacement using each structure individually as a starting model failed. The model of SH3p40 was refined using CNS (45.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T.

The refinement was initially tried in both space groups C2221 and P21; the Rcryst values clearly excluded the orthorhombic form. The asymmetric unit contains two SH3p40 domains, which were refined by constraining the core of the monomers (i.e. β-strands excluding the loops) with a 2-fold symmetry.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData statisticsFree SH3p40SH3p40/polyPp47 complexData collection details Space groupP21P212121 Cell dimensions (Å, degree)a = 35.2; b = 45.2; c = 35, 1; β = 111.4a = 39.6; b = 50.5; c = 68.2 SH3 per asymmetric unit22Data collection statistics Resolution range (Å)20-223.7-1.46 Unique reflections687623,423 Redundancy3.4 (2.8)aValues in parentheses indicate the highest resolution shell: 2.04-2.10 Å.5.0 (4.0)bValues in parantheses indicate the highest resolution shell: 1.46-1.54 Å.

Immediately prior to fusion, gp41 exists in a prehairpin intermediate in which the N- and C-peptide regions of gp41 are exposed. Rearrangement of this intermediate into a six-helix bundle composed of a trimeric coiled coil from the N-peptide region (N-trimer) surrounded by three peptides from the C-peptide region provides the driving force for membrane fusion, whereas prevention of six-helix bundle formation inhibits viral entry. Because of its central role in mediating viral entry, the N-trimer region of gp41 is a key vaccine target. Extensive efforts to discover potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies (Abs) against the N-trimer region have, thus far, been unsuccessful. In this study, we attached a potent C-peptide inhibitor that binds to the N-trimer region to cargo proteins of various sizes to examine the steric accessibility of the N-trimer during fusion. These inhibitors show a progressive loss of potency with increasing cargo size. Extension of the cargo/C-peptide linker partially restores inhibitory potency. These results demonstrate that the human immunodeficiency virus defends its critical hairpin-forming machinery by steric exclusion of large proteins and may explain the current dearth of neutralizing Abs against the N-trimer. In contrast, previous results suggest the C-peptide region is freely accessible during fusion, demonstrating that the N- and C-peptide regions are in structurally distinct environments. Based on these results, we also propose new strategies for the generation of neutralizing Abs that overcome this steric block.

Env is initially produced as gp160, which is proteolytically cleaved into non-covalently associated transmembrane (gp41) and surface (gp120) subunits. gp120 is primarily involved in recognition of cellular receptors, whereas gp41 is anchored in the viral membrane and mediates membrane fusion. The gp41 ectodomain contains two helical heptad repeat sequences (N- and C-peptide regions) (1.Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct.

A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to these helical regions (N- and C-peptides) are dominant-negative inhibitors of HIV membrane fusion (2.Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 3.Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Isolated N- and C-peptides form a six-helix bundle (trimer-of-hairpins) when mixed in solution (4.Tan K.

In this structure, three N-peptides form a central parallel trimeric coiled coil (N-trimer) surrounded by three anti-parallel C-peptides that nestle between neighboring N-peptides. Based largely on these inhibitory and structural data, a working model of HIV-1 membrane fusion has been proposed (Fig. 1) (3.Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 5.Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Initial interaction of Env with its target cell occurs via gp120 binding to CD4 and a coreceptor (typically CCR5 or CXCR4). This binding induces a series of large conformational changes in gp120 that are propagated to gp41 via the gp41-gp120 interface. At this stage, gp41 transiently adopts an extended “prehairpin intermediate” conformation that bridges both the viral and cellular membranes. This state is believed to persist for at least 15 min (3.Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 7.Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) but eventually collapses into a trimer-of-hairpins structure that pulls both membranes into tight apposition and induces membrane fusion (Fig. 1). In this model, the prehairpin intermediate exposes the isolated N-trimer, whereas the C-peptide region exists in an unknown and possibly unstructured conformation remote from the N-trimer (3.Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). At this stage, the prehairpin intermediate is vulnerable to binding of exogenous N- and C-peptides. Binding of these peptide inhibitors denies access of the endogenous N- or C-peptide regions to their appropriate intramolecular partners, thwarting hairpin formation and membrane fusion. This model predicts that any molecule that binds to the prehairpin intermediate and disrupts association of the N- and C-peptides will inhibit membrane fusion and has been successfully applied to the development of several potent entry inhibitors (9.Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 10.Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, the gp41 prehairpin intermediate has several promising features as an inhibitory target (12.Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Peptide mimics of the N-trimer region have been structurally characterized at high resolution (4.Tan K. Liu J. Wang J. Shen S.

The interface between the N- and C-peptides is highly conserved among diverse HIV strains of both laboratory-adapted and clinical isolates (9.Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The N-trimer also presents a long (>100 Å) deep groove with an extensive binding surface (4.Tan K. Liu J. Wang J. Shen S.

The most potent are peptides derived from the C-peptide region (e.g. C34, DP178/T20, T1249), which have low nm IC50s against viral entry in cell-cell fusion (syncytia formation), and viral infectivity assays (reviewed in Ref. 17.Weiss C.D. AIDS Rev. 2003; 5: 214-221PubMed Google Scholar). Several mutations leading to T-20 resistance have been mapped to the N-peptide region of gp41 (18.Rimsky L.T. Shugars D.C. Matthews T.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 986-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), providing strong support that the N-trimer is the primary target of C-peptide inhibitors. gp41 N-trimer as a Vaccine Target—As demonstrated by the efficacy of C-peptide inhibitors, the N-trimer region of gp41 is a very attractive candidate for vaccine efforts. Many such efforts have been undertaken using various peptide mimics of the N-trimer region (e.g. N-peptide, 5-helix, IZN36, and N35CCG-N13) (17.Weiss C.D.

These efforts have produced a large number of Abs with specific and high affinity binding to their targets but weak and/or narrow neutralizing activity in standard viral entry and spread assays. Interestingly, some of these anti-N-trimer Abs can inhibit fusion if bound to a temperature-arrested intermediate fusion state (19.Golding H. Zaitseva M. de Rosny E. King L.R. Manischewitz J.

Currently, there are only two reported anti-gp41 Abs that exhibit potent and broadly neutralizing activity, 2F5 and 4E10, which bind just outside the C-terminal border of the C-peptide region, an area with uncertain structure (reviewed in Ref. 22.McGaughey G.B. Barbato G. Bianchi E. Freidinger R.M. Garsky V.M. Hurni W.M. Joyce J.G. Liang X. Miller M.D. Pessi A. Shiver J.W. Bogusky M.J. Curr. HIV Res. 2004; 2: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the N-trimer of gp41 is sterically restricted in the prehairpin intermediate, which may explain the current dearth of broadly neutralizing Abs against this target (Fig. 1). All of the known fusion inhibitors that target this structure (e.g. C34, T-20, T-1249, D-peptides) are small (<40 residue) peptides and could circumvent such a steric block. We have constructed fusions of a well characterized C-peptide inhibitor (C34) to a series of protein cargoes of varying sizes to determine whether such a steric block exists and, if so, to define its size cutoff. Our results demonstrate that C-peptide fusion proteins lose inhibitory potency with increasing size and that the N-trimer region of gp41 is likely to be poorly accessible to proteins as large as Abs. These results have important implications for gp41 vaccine design as well as for the production of second-generation C-peptide entry inhibitors. This steric restriction also helps to better define the conformation of the prehairpin intermediate. Reagents—Plasmids were obtained from the following sources: pET vectors (Novagen), pMAL-c2G (New England Biolabs), pEBB-HXB2 and pEBB-JRFL (gifts from B. Chen) (23.Chen B.K. Saksela K. Andino R. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse phase HPLC was performed using a C18 column (Vydac). All Ni affinity purifications used His-Select HC nickel affinity gel (Sigma) or His-Select HC nickel magnetic resin (Sigma). The National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program provided the following reagents: pNL4–3.Luc.R-E-(N. Landau), HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-galactosidase cells (M. Emerman), HOS-CD4-fusin/CCR5 cells (N. Landau). Protein Expression, Purification, and Characterization—C37-H6 (C37), derived from the HXB2 Env sequence, was expressed and purified as previously described (9.Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Proteins used in this study were bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), human ubiquitin (Ub), sperm whale myoglobin (Mb), enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP; Clontech), and Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP; New England Biolabs). Linker sequences were Ser4Gly2 for BPTI-C37, Ub-C37, and GFP-C37 and Ser5Gly2 for Mb-C37 and MBP-C37 (linker sequences are slightly different for cloning reasons). The extended linker constructs had the following linker sequences: SSS(GGGS)3-SSSGG (MBP1-C37) and SSS(GGGS)3S(GGGS)3SSSGG (MBP2-C37). The DNA encoding each protein was cloned into the following plasmids: pET9a (for BPTI-C37, Ub-C37, Mb-C37, and GFP-C37), pET20b (for BPTI-H6, Ub-H6, Mb-H6, and GFP-H6); pMAL-c2G (for MBP-H6, MBP-C37, MBP1-C37, and MBP2-C37). Proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) for pET9a and pET20b vectors and XL1-Blue (Stratagene) for pMal-c2G vectors. All proteins have C-terminal His tags (His6) and were purified using Ni affinity chromatography. BPTI required refolding after expression for correct formation of disulfide bonds. Briefly, after Ni affinity purification, BPTI-C37-H6 and BPTI-H6 were reduced with 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at pH 8 and dialyzed into 5% acetic acid. The proteins were air oxidized in the presence of a 1:10 ratio of oxidized:reduced glutathione at pH 8, 4 °C for 24 h. The correctly folded proteins were isolated using reverse phase HPLC and were confirmed by near-UV circular dichroism (Aviv 62DS) and measurement of trypsin inhibiting activity as previously described (24.Coplen L.J. Frieden R.W. Goldenberg D.P. Proteins. 1990; 7: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cys-Gly-Gly-Asp-IZN36 (10.Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11187-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) was cloned into pET14b and expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS. IZN36 was purified from inclusion bodies (solubilized in 6 m GuHCl) using Ni affinity chromatography. The protein was then dialyzed into 5% acetic acid and purified by reverse phase HPLC. This material was reduced with TCEP (Pierce) and biotinylated at its unique Cys residue using Biotin-HPDP (Pierce). After biotinylation, the His tag was removed by thrombin cleavage (Novagen), and the cleaved product was purified by reverse phase HPLC. The sequence of the final product is GSHMCGGDIKKEIEAIKKEQEAIKKKIEAIEKEISGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQARIL. All protein masses were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization or electrospray mass spectrometry (University of Utah Core Facility). All proteins were judged >98% pure by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were measured by UV absorbance at 280 nm (25.Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—Binding experiments were performed using a Biacore 2000 optical biosensor (University of Utah Protein Interaction Core Facility) equipped with research-grade CM5 sensor chips (Biacore). A standard coupling protocol was employed to immobilize streptavidin (SA; Pierce) (26.Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Biotinylated IZN36 was captured on a SA surface, and free SA surfaces served as references. Binding analysis of C37 and C37 fusion proteins was performed at 25 °C with a data collection rate of 2.5 Hz. The binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline; Invitrogen) + 0.005% P20 detergent (Biacore) + 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Fisher)) was prepared, vacuum filtered, and degassed immediately prior to use. Stock solutions of C37, C37 fusion proteins, and corresponding control proteins (without C37) were prepared in binding buffer at 100 nm. Protein binding was analyzed by injecting samples for 1 min over the IZN36 and reference surfaces using KINJECT at a flow rate of 50–100 μl/min. The dissociations were monitored for 3 min. The IZN36 surfaces were completely regenerated using one 3-s pulse of 6 m guanidine-HCl or three 6-s pulses of 0.1% SDS. Data from the reference flow cells were subtracted to remove systematic artifacts that occurred in all flow cells (27.Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The data were normalized to the highest point in the response curve to facilitate comparison. Binding at one concentration was analyzed using a 1:1 binding model in CLAMP (28.Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 149-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), assuming enough information from the curvature of the responses to determine the approximate kinetic parameters for the reactions (29.Canziani G.A. Klakamp S. Myszka D.G. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 325: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cell-cell Fusion and Viral Infectivity Assay—Cell-cell fusion was monitored as previously described (30.Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Briefly, HXB2 Env-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells (gift from M. Krieger (31.Kozarsky K. Penman M. Basiripour L. Haseltine W. Sodroski J. Krieger M. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 1989; 2: 163-169PubMed Google Scholar)) were mixed with HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-galactosidase cells in the presence of inhibitors for 20 h at 37 °C. Syncytia were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Invitrogen) and counted. Viral infectivity was measured as previously described (9.Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Briefly, pseudotyped viruses were produced by co-transfecting 293T cells using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) with pNL4–3.Luc.R-E- and either pEBB-HXB2 or pEBB-JRFL. After 36–48 h, viral supernatants were collected and sterile filtered. HXB2 or JRFL pseudotyped virus was added to HOS-CD4-fusin or HOS-CD4-CCR5 cells, respectively, in the presence of inhibitors. HXB2 assays included 20 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (23.Chen B.K. Saksela K. Andino R. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 12 h, virus and inhibitor were removed and replaced with fresh media. Cells were lysed 40–44 h after infection using Glo lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured using Bright-Glo (Promega). IC50 values for both assays were calculated by fitting data to the equation, y = k/(1+ [inhibitor]/IC50), where y is the normalized number of syncytia or luciferase activity and k is the scaling constant (k = 1 for syncytia assay and is floated for viral infectivity assay, see Fig. 2B legend). Assays for Inhibitor Proteolysis and Precipitation—C37 fusion inhibitors were incubated in tissue culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum; Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 20 h. Proteins were purified from the medium by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with magnetic Ni affinity beads. The resin was washed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were eluted by boiling in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Eluted samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with SimplyBlue stain (Invitrogen). Unpurified media samples were analyzed before and after centrifugation (10 min. at 18,000 × g) by Western blot using polyclonal rabbit anti-His tag Ab (Abcam) and SuperSignal West Pico substrate (Pierce), as well as visually analyzed for precipitate. Production of Fusion Proteins—To test for steric constraints in accessing the gp41 N-trimer region, we constructed a series of inhibitors containing a C-peptide attached to cargo proteins of various sizes (Fig. 1). The cargo partners used in this study were selected for the following properties: monomeric, soluble, globular, stable, tolerant to C-terminal additions, and free of nonspecific peptide binding. Cargo proteins meeting these inclusion criteria and used in this study range from 6 to 41 kDa (Table I). For these studies, C37 (9.Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), the recombinant His-tagged version of the previously characterized synthetic peptide C34 (30.Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 32.Malashkevich V.N. Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9134-9139Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), was used as the reference inhibitor. In each fusion protein, C37 is connected at its N terminus to the C terminus of the cargo by a flexible 6- or 7-residue Ser/Gly linker. This linker was designed to be long enough to allow the proper orientation of C37 as it binds to the N-trimer but short enough for the attached cargo to prevent access to an occluded binding site. The N terminus of C37 was chosen for attachment of cargo because this attachment site points away from the membrane (whereas the C terminus of C37 is expected to be near the viral membrane and, therefore, less accessible; see Fig. 1). For each fusion protein, a matching control protein lacking C37 was also produced.Table IIC50 (in nm) of fusion proteins in cell-cell fusion and viral infectivity assaysProteinFusion partner molecular massCell-cell fusionIC50 ratio (cell-cell fusion)Viral infectivity HXB2IC50 ratio HXB2Viral infectivity JRFLIC50 ratio JRFLkDaC3700.851.02.81.08.21.0BPTI-C376.51.51.83.11.14.80.6Ub-C378.64.75.56.82.537.74.6Mb-C371730.836.258.021.041450.5GFP-C372728.934.011842.853365.0MBP-C374119222520674.81874228MBP1-C374175.188.488.932.264078.0MBP2-C374131.236.779.228.751662.9IC50 S.E. is <25% for both assays. IC50 ratios are relative to C37. Open table in a new tab IC50 S.E. is <25% for both assays. IC50 ratios are relative to C37. Size and Inhibitory Potency Are Inversely Correlated—The inhibitory potency of each inhibitor was tested using a cell-cell fusion (syncytia) assay utilizing HXB2 Env and two viral infectivity assays utilizing either HXB2 (X4) or JRFL (R5) Envs (Table I, Fig. 2). C37 shows high potency inhibition in all assays (IC50 = 0.85–8.2 nm). Inhibition is slightly weaker than seen with C34 (30.Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), as expected from the loss of helix-stabilizing synthetic blocking groups found in C34. For reference, the anti-gp41 Abs 2F5 and 4E10 have reported IC50 values of ∼0.2–7 nm against HXB2/IIIB laboratory strains in cell-cell and viral infectivity assays similar to those used in this study (33.Zwick M.B. Komori H.K. Stanfield R.L. Church S. Wang M. Parren P.W. Kunert R. Katinger H. Wilson I.A. Burton D.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3155-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 34.Stiegler G.

The smallest fusion protein, BPTI-C37, also displays high potency in both assays, very similar to C37, demonstrating that our C37-cargo linker does not interfere with inhibitory activity. Ub-C37 is a slightly weaker (2.5–5.5-fold) inhibitor than C37, whereas Mb-C37 and GFP-C37 both show more substantial (21–65-fold) reductions in potency in both assays. MBP-C37 shows the most dramatic change with a 75–228-fold drop in potency. None of the control proteins (cargo without C37 peptide) inhibits at up to 1 μm (10 μm for MBP with JRFL Env) in either assay (data not shown). In general, the cell-cell fusion and viral infectivity assays show similar losses of activity with increasing size of the inhibitors, with a slightly more pronounced effect on cell-cell fusion and JRFL-mediated viral entry. For HXB2 Env we observed up to a 4-fold greater potency in cell-cell fusion versus viral infectivity as seen in studies of other fusion inhibitors (2.Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K.

As expected, inhibitors were less potent against the primary isolate JRFL in the viral infectivity assay. For most of the inhibitors, the viral infectivity data show a reproducible increase in infectivity (above the uninhibited values) at low inhibitor concentrations (see the legend to Fig. 2B). This “overshoot” has also occasionally been seen in other studies of fusion inhibitors (36.Wei X. Decker J.M. Liu H. Zhang Z. Arani R.B. Kilby J.M. Saag M.S. Wu X. Shaw G.M. Kappes J.C. Antimicrob.

The C-peptide Remains Accessible when Linked to Fusion Partners—To ensure that linkage of C37-H6 to each of the partner proteins did not affect the accessibility of C37 for binding to a sterically open target, the fusion proteins and C37 were assayed for binding to IZN36, a soluble mimic of the N-trimer (10.Eckert D.M.

https://openalex.org/W1969154550,"Inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with increased risk of developing colon cancer. A possible role of the pro-inflammatory leukotriene D4 (LTD4) in this process has been implicated by the findings that LTD4 can signal increased proliferation and survival, both hallmarks of a cancer cell, in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells. Here we make the novel finding that LTD4 can also signal increased motility in these cells. In parallel, we found that LTD4 induced a simultaneous transient 10-fold increase in Rac but not Cdc42 activity. These data were also supported by the ability of LTD4 to activate the Rac GDP/GTP exchange factor Vav2. Further, LTD4 triggered a 3-fold transient increase in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylation, a possible upstream activator of the Vav2/Rac signaling pathway. The activation of Rac was blocked by the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin and by transfection of a kinase-negative mutant of PI3K or a dominant-negative form of Vav2. Furthermore, Rac was found to co-localize with actin in LTD4-generated membrane ruffles that were formed by a PI3K-dependent mechanism. In accordance, the inhibition of the PI3K and Rac signaling pathway also blocked the LTD4-induced migration of the intestinal cells. The present data reveal that an inflammatory mediator such as LTD4 cannot only increase proliferation and survival of non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells but also, via a PI3K/Rac signaling pathway, trigger a motile response in such cells. These data demonstrate the capacity of inflammatory mediators to participate in the process by which inflammatory bowel conditions increase the risk for colon cancer development.

These data demonstrate the capacity of inflammatory mediators to participate in the process by which inflammatory bowel conditions increase the risk for colon cancer development. Migration of epithelial cells is essential during the development of the gut and during different pathological situations such as wound healing and tumor metastasis (1.Schmitz A.A. Govek E.E. Bottner B. Van Aelst L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The conversion from a sessile to a migratory phenotype requires an extensive remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (2.Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In response to different chemotactic substances, cell migration is initiated by the formation of lamellipodia or membrane ruffles at the leading front of a migrating cell (3.Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 57-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 4.Small J.V. Stradal T. Vignal E. Rottner K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 112-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). It is well established that epithelial cell migration is stimulated by activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (5.Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 6.Boyer B. Valles A.M. Edme N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling pathways activated by such receptors and responsible for the coordinated changes in the actin cytoskeleton seen during cell motility generally include the activation of different members of the Rho family of GTPases (3.Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 57-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The Rho family consists of three main members: Rho; Rac; and Cdc42. In most cell types, these proteins execute specific functions, i.e. Rho promotes the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes and Rac initiates actin polymerization at the cell membrane and is responsible for the generation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, whereas Cdc42 promotes the formation of filopodia and microspikes at the cell periphery (7.Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). These monomeric GTPases cycle between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state. In their inactive state, Rho GTPases are bound to proteins called guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology; LTD4, leukotriene D4; PTX, pertussis toxin; EGF, epidermal growth factor; DN, dominant-negative; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Int 407, intestinal epithelial 407 cell line. activated by extracellular stimuli, catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho GTPases and thereby activate these proteins. In their GTP-bound state, these proteins interact with specific effectors to initiate downstream signals and functions (7.Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). The subsequent hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP is catalyzed by the family of GTPase-activating proteins (8.Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The Dbl family constitutes the main group of GEFs acting on Rho GTPases (9.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). A hallmark of these exchange factors is that they contain two key conserved domains, a Dbl homology domain that is believed to be responsible for catalyzing GDP/GTP exchange on Rho GTPases and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that is important for cellular localization through its interaction with lipids and/or proteins (10.Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Notably, the PH domain on GEFs are known to bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a substrate and a product of the PI3K, respectively. Such a lipid/protein interaction offers a reasonable explanation for how the PI3K can enable activation of Rac GTPase. It has been suggested that the association between GEF and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate may cause dissociation of the GEF from its binding to guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (9.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Possibly, such a mechanism could explain how agonist-induced activation of PI3K and generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate could enable a downstream phosphorylation and activation of Vav (11.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Src tyrosine kinase, a kinase known to be activated by LTD4 (12.Thodeti C.K. Adolfsson J. Juhas M. Sjölander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9849-9853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), has been shown to phosphorylate and activate Vav2 and subsequently activate Rac (13.Marignani P.A. Carpenter C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PI3Ks are composed of a catalytic subunit (p110) and a regulatory (p85/p55) subunit (14.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the p85 subunit is essential for the translocation and activation of the p110/85 complex from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where it interacts with its effectors (15.Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibition of PI3K by both molecular and pharmacological approaches blocks membrane ruffling and inhibits cell migration (16.Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Leukotrienes belong to an important group of pro-inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and have been implicated in many inflammatory conditions (17.Claesson H.E. Dahlen S.E. J. Intern. Med. 1999; 245: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18.Serhan C.N. Haeggström J.Z. Leslie C.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). LTD4 is the most potent of the cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4), and it has been implicated in conditions such as asthma and inflammatory bowel diseases (19.Chan C.C. McKee K. Tagari P.

LTD4 mediates its effects by the binding to two different G protein-coupled receptors, CysLT1 and CysLT2 (20.Brink C. Dahlen S.E. Drazen J. Evans J.F. Hay D.W. Nicosia S. Serhan C.N. Shimizu T. Yokomizo T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 195-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The CysLT1 receptor has a much higher affinity for its ligand than the CysLT2-receptor and has been shown to couple to both a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive and a PTX-insensitive G protein, indicating that different signal transduction pathways can be initiated and possibly mediate distinct downstream functions (12.Thodeti C.K.

We have previously shown that prolonged exposure of non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells to LTD4 resulted in up-regulation of factors related to colon carcinogenesis such as cyclooxygenase-2, β-catenin, and Bcl-2 (23.Öhd J.F. Wikström K. Sjölander A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that LTD4 induces proliferative and survival responses, hallmarks of a cancer cell, in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells (21.Paruchuri S. Hallberg B. Juhas M. Larsson C. Sjolander A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1883-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Paruchuri S. Sjölander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45577-45585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Taken together with the fact that ulcerative colitis is associated with an increased incidence of neoplastic transformation (25.Ekbom A. Helmick C. Zack M. Adami H.O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1228-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar), the indications showing that there exists a link between inflammation and cancer (26.Sheng H. Shao J. Kirkland S.C. Isakson P. Coffey R.J. Morrow J. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2254-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) and earlier studies demonstrating that colon cancer is underrepresented in a population of patients with ulcerative colitis treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (27.Smalley W.E. Du Bois R.N. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) suggest that LTD4 could be an essential factor in mediating the coupling between inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. Transformed cancer cells exhibit distinct properties including increased proliferation, survival, and migration. Interestingly enough, we have previously shown that LTD4 triggered both a proliferative and a survival response in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells (27.Smalley W.E. Du Bois R.N. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored whether and how the pro-inflammatory LTD4 affects migration in these intestinal epithelial cells. Materials—Antibodies for Rac and p85 subunit of PI3K were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Akt antibodies (phospho-Akt, Ser473; total Akt) were from Cell Signaling technology (Beverly, MA). LTD4 was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). ZM198615 was a gift from (AstraZeneca, R&D Lund). ECL Western blot detection reagents and Hyperfilms were from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Wortmannin and LY294002 were from Calbiochem. PTX was obtained from Speywood Pharma Ltd. (Maidenhead, United Kingdom). Peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit and mouse IgG originated from Dako A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark). Alexa 546 phalloidin is from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—The Intestine 407 cell line was isolated from the intestine of a human embryo of ∼2-month gestation and was successfully maintained in culture without any immortalizing transfections (28.Henle G. Deinhardt F. J. Immunol. 1957; 79: 54-59PubMed Google Scholar). These human intestinal epithelial cells (Int 407; Flow Laboratory), which exhibit typical epithelial morphology and growth (28.Henle G. Deinhardt F. J. Immunol. 1957; 79: 54-59PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured as a monolayer to ∼80% confluence for 5 days. Cell cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in basal medium Earle's supplemented with 15% newborn calf serum, 55 IU/ml penicillin, and 55 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were regularly tested to ensure the absence of mycoplasma contamination. cDNAs and Transfections—Cells were transfected with dominant negative p85 of PI3K or dominant-negative (DN) form of Vav2, which lacks an active dbl domain (L342R/L343S) for 6 h and were allowed to grow in serum containing medium for another 24 h. The DN-p85 construct was generously provided by Dr. Arthur Mercurio (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA), whereas the DN-Vav2 construct was generously provided by Dr. Christopher Carpenter (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). Control cells were transfected with empty pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Transient transfections of the cells were achieved using 3.5 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and 1.8 μg of plasmid DNA/ml and were performed in serum-free medium, essentially according to the protocol provided by the supplier. In all of the transfection experiments, it was routinely confirmed that the empty vector had no effect. GST Pull-down Assays—The cDNA clone encoding the GST fusion protein of the PAK1B binding domain of Rac and Cdc-42 (PAKcrib; amino acids 56–267) was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T and was expressed in Escherichia coli and cultured at 30 °C (29.Dib K. Melander F. Axelsson L. Dagher M.C. Aspenstrom P. Andersson T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24181-24188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The expression of GST fusion proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the E. coli were subsequently collected by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 15 min followed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline. Triton X-100 (final concentration 1%) was added to lysate, and particulate matter was removed by centrifuging at 5000 × g for 15 min. The cleared lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C, and the beads were subsequently washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Lysates of unstimulated or stimulated cells were prepared in 1.0 ml of the lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2. GST fusion protein pre-bound to Sepharose beads was incubated with 1.0 ml of the cell lysates (1 mg/ml total cell protein) for 1 h at 4°C. Thereafter, the beads were washed once with ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and twice with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 30 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl-fluoride). Cell Lysis—Cells were preincubated with inhibitors (Gi protein inhibitor PTX (500 ng/ml) for 2 h and PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 for 30 min), and stimulations (80 nm LTD4) were terminated by adding ice-cold buffer A. Thereafter, the cells were kept on ice for 30 min in the lysis buffer, and remaining cell debris was scraped loose into the buffer. The lysates were homogenized 10 times on ice in a glass tissue grinder (Dounce) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The protein content of each supernatant was measured and compensated for to ensure equal protein loading. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, lysates containing 1 mg/ml protein were incubated with 4 μgofthe anti-p85, anti-Vav2, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h, after which 20 μl of protein G plus agarose was added and incubated for an additional 1 h. The beads then were washed three times in the lysis buffer mentioned above, mixed with sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged, and the proteins are separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dried milk at room temperature and then incubated with a primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Phospho-Akt 1:500 and 1:1000 dilutions were used for all of the other antibodies. Subsequently, all of the membranes were washed extensively and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat antirabbit, anti-sheep, or anti-mouse antibody (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the membrane was washed again extensively, incubated with ECL Western blot detection reagents, and finally exposed to hyperfilm-ECL to visualize immunoreactive proteins. Immunofluorescence—The cells were seeded on glass coverslips and grown for 5 days. Thereafter, the cells were serum-starved for 2 h and stimulated with LTD4. The stimulation was terminated by fixing for 10 min at room temperature in a 3.7% paraformaldehyde and PBS solution, after which the cells were permeabilized in a 0.5% Triton X-100 and PBS solution for 15 min. The coverslips were subsequently washed twice in PBS and incubated at room temperature in a 5% goat serum albumin, 0.39 Triton X-100, and PBS solution for 40 min, and the cells were stained for 1 h with an antibody against Rac. The coverslips then were washed six times in PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted 1:200 in 1% goat serum and PBS solution for 1 h). The coverslips were washed thereafter six times in PBS, counterstained with Alexa phalloidin 546, washed, and mounted in fluorescent-mounting medium (Dako A/S). Samples were examined and photographed with a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope using a Plan-Apo ×60 objective. Images were recorded with a scientific grade CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) and subsequently analyzed with HazeBuster deconvolution software (Vay Tek, Inc., Fairland, CT). Migration Assay—Migration of intestinal epithelial cells was assayed using Boyden chamber with polycarbonate filters of 8-μm pore size. The LTD4 was added to the lower well of the chamber along with serum-free medium, and the filter was placed above. 100 μl of cell suspension (1 × 105 cells/ml) in serum-free basal medium Earle's was added to the top chamber. In the case of inhibitor treatments, the cells were pretreated with the indicated inhibitors and the respective inhibitors were also added at the concentrations indicated to the upper chamber during the process of cell migration. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 18 h, the filters were disassembled and the upper surface of each filter was scraped free of cells by wiping it with a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated to the outer surface of the filter were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained for 20 min with 0.1% crystal violet in 10% methanol. The dye was eluted with 100 ml of 1% SDS. The absorbance was measured in Nunc Polysorp 96-well plates, and the absorbance at 590 nm was measured using a Fluostar plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offenberg, Germany). LTD4 Induces Cell Migration and Activation of Vav and Rac in the Intestinal Epithelial Cell Line, Int 407—As shown in Fig. 1A, LTD4 could induce migration of intestinal epithelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner, although less prominent than that seen in a colon cancer cell line, Caco-2 (30.Massoumi R. Nielsen C.K. Azemovic D. Sjölander A. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The Rac and Cdc42 GTPase have both been implicated in the regulation of migration of different cell types (7.Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). To examine the ability of LTD4 to activate Rac and Cdc42, we measured the activity of Rac and Cdc42 in cells using the affinity precipitation assay in which the GST-PAKcrib fusion protein binds the active GTP-bound form of Rac or Cdc42. We found that the amount of active Rac-GTP increased in a time-dependent manner upon LTD4 stimulation of Int 407 cells with a maximum after 15 min (Fig. 1B). Densitometric analysis confirmed the transient activation of Rac with a maximum of 942 ± 118%, 15 min after the addition of LTD4. Under similar conditions, we were unable to detect any activation of Cdc42 (Fig. 1B). Whole cell lysates were used to ensure that the total amounts of Rac and Cdc42 did not change upon LTD4 stimulation (Fig. 1B). As a positive control for the activation of Rac and Cdc42, the cells were stimulated with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Fig. 1B). Rac is known to be activated by GEFs such as Vav and Sos. Therefore, we investigated whether Vav2 or Sos was activated by LTD4. We could not detect any activation of Sos by LTD4 in these cells (data not shown); however, Vav2 immunoprecipitated from cells stimulated with LTD4 for 15 min, the time for maximal activation of Rac, exhibited a distinctly increased tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). This tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 is indicative of its activation (31.Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We transfected cells thereafter with a previously described (13.Marignani P.A. Carpenter C.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) DN form of Vav2 (DN-Vav2) and noted that, in such transfected cells, the LTD4-induced activation of Rac was abolished (Fig. 1D). These results clearly show that the LTD4-induced activation of Rac is mediated through Vav2. To further analyze the LTD4-induced Rac signaling pathway, we investigated whether LTD4 could activate PI3K in these cells. The activity of this enzyme was first assessed by investigating the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 subunit of PI3K (15.Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were stimulated with LTD4 for indicated periods of time, and immunoprecipitates of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were then blotted with an anti-p85 antibody (Fig. 2A) or vice versa (Fig. 2B). As seen in Fig. 2, A and B, LTD4 caused an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. The time kinetics of this activation of PI3K was similar to the LTD4-induced activation Rac (Fig. 1B). Secondly, we also investigated the ability of LTD4 to induce activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, a well known downstream target of PI3K activity. Cells stimulated with LTD4 exhibited a clear activation of Akt that was also confirmed to be sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 2C). These results clearly argue for the ability of LTD4 to cause activation of PI3K in intestinal epithelial Int 407 cells. Involvement of Gi and PI3K in the LTD4-induced Activation of Rac—To explore whether Gi PI3K signals are involved in the LTD4-induced activation of Rac, we pretreated the cells with the Gi protein inhibitor PTX (500 ng/ml for 2 h) and either of two different PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 (50 μm for 30 min) or wortmannin (100 nm for 30 min) (32.Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The cells then were stimulated with LTD4 for 15 min, after which they were lysed. Thereafter, the different lysates were analyzed in the GST-PAKcrib binding assay to assess the activity of Rac. We have reported earlier that LTD4 can signal via a PTX-sensitive G protein (21.Paruchuri S. Hallberg B. Juhas M. Larsson C. Sjolander A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1883-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Paruchuri S. Sjölander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45577-45585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with those results, preincubation with PTX significantly inhibited the LTD4-mediated activation of Rac (Fig. 3A). We also observed that preincubation with either of the PI3K inhibitors led to an almost complete block of the LTD4-mediated activation of Rac, suggesting that a PI3K signals upstream of Rac in these cells (Fig. 3A). This conclusion was confirmed by transfecting the cells with a DN p85 expressing vector (DN-p85). As shown in Fig. 3B, the expression of DN-p85 in these cells also blocked the LTD4-induced activation of Rac. LTD4 Mediates PI3K- and Rac-dependent Formation of Membrane Ruffles in Intestinal Epithelial Cells—The Rac GTPase has previously been shown to induce the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles in different cell types (33.Fenteany G. Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 34.Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Here we show that cells stimulated with LTD4 formed more membrane ruffles when compared with unstimulated control cells (Fig. 4). The formation of these membrane ruffles was blocked effectively by inhibiting the PI3K/Rac signaling pathway with either wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig. 4). We also examined whether and how LTD4 influenced the distribution of Rac during the formation of membrane ruffles. Unstimulated control cells immunostained with an anti-Rac antibody exhibited a fairly homogenous staining of Rac throughout the cell (Fig. 5, top left). In contrast, LTD4 stimulation caused a redistribution of Rac to the actin-containing membrane ruffles (Fig. 5, bottom left and middle). Merge pictures more clearly show the LTD4-induced co-localization of Rac and actin in the membrane ruffles (Fig. 5, the two panels to the right). To ascertain that the LTD4-induced membrane ruffles are indeed mediated via the CysLT1 receptor, we also preincubated cells with the CysLT1 receptor antagonist ZM198615. Alone this antagonist did not affect the number of ruffles of unstimulated cells, 17 ± 2 ruffles/cell in unexposed control cells and 20 ± 2 ruffles/cell in cells incubated with ZM198615 alone. The obtained results clearly show that, in the presence of ZM198615, all of the LTD4-induced membrane ruffles were abolished (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Co-localization of Rac and actin in the LTD4-generated membrane ruffles. A, cells were stimulated or not with 80 nm LTD4 for 30 min. The cells then were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for with Alexa 488 phalloidin (1:200) for F-actin and immunostained for Rac as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The different samples then were examined in a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope. The top and middle three panels show, from left to right, Rac immunostaining, F-actin staining, and an overlay image of the two. B, the cells were preincubated with 30 μm CysLT1 antagonist ZM198615 for 15 min. Thereafter, the cells were stimulated or not with 80 nm LTD4 for 30 min. The two panels show F-actin staining of unstimulated and LTD4-stimulated cells. The results illustrated in the figure are representative of four separate experiments. C, the diagram shows the accumulated results of LTD4-induced membrane ruffles in the absence of presence of ZM198615, unstimulated control cells (C), calculated as number of ruffles per cell. A minimum of 100 cells was investigated in each experimental group. The data are given as the means ± S.E. of four separate experiments. Statistical significances were evaluated using the unpaired Student's t test. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The LTD4-induced Migration Is Dependent on the PI3K/Rac Signaling Pathway—Based on the finding that LTD4 generates the formation of membrane ruffles via a PI3K/Rac signaling pathway, we investigated whether the same pathway was also involved in the LTD4-induced migration of intestinal epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, the intestinal epithelial cell motility initiated by LTD4 was effectively impaired by PTX and both of the PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin. Finally, a simplified schematic model of the signaling pathway participating in the regulation of LTD4-induced motility in intestinal epithelial cell is outlined in Fig. 6B. The CysLT1-receptor has been shown previously to activate both a PTX-sensitive and a PTX-insensitive heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathway (12.Thodeti C.K. Adolfsson J. Juhas M. Sjölander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9849-9853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21.Paruchuri S. Hallberg B. Juhas M. Larsson C. Sjolander A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1883-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Hoshino M. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4878-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This receptor has also previously been shown to mediate the activation of the small RhoA GTPase via a PTX-insensitive signaling pathway (12.Thodeti C.K. Adolfsson J. Juhas M. Sjölander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9849-9853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, here we show that LTD4-triggered activation of the small GTPase Rac was inhibited by PTX similar to the LTD4-induced increase in survival and proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (21.Paruchuri S. Hallberg B. Juhas M. Larsson C. Sjolander A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1883-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Paruchuri S. Sjölander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45577-45585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Investigation of leukotriene-mediated activation of Rac in other cell types supports the present observation. In HL-60 cells, LTB4-induced Rac activation and chemotaxis were blocked by pretreatment with PTX (35.Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), as was LTD4-mediated Rac activation in THP-1 cells (22.Hoshino M. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4878-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The notion that two different signaling pathways regulate the activity of RhoA and Rac in intestinal epithelial cell probably provides the CysLT1-receptor with a more sophisticated control of epithelial cell motility. Subsequent to these findings, we then sought to identify the signaling molecules downstream of CysLT1-receptor activation of a PTX-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein that could be implicated in the activation of Rac. One obvious candidate to look for is the PI3K. Indeed, it has been reported that lipids generated by the PI3K can participate in the regulation of small G proteins as well as cell motility (11.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 36.Marcoux N. Vuori K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6100-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We not only found that LTD4 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K, which was used here as an index of its activation, but that the time kinetics of LTD4-induced phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K was also parallel to the activation of Rac in intestinal epithelial cells. To further investigate the possibility that PI3K has a role in the LTD4-induced activation of Rac, we blocked the PI3K activity by different means and tested the effects of such treatments on the Rac activity. We found that pretreatment of Int 407 cells either with wortmannin or LY294002, two structurally unrelated PI3K inhibitors, and also transfection of these cells with a DN p85 construct halted the LTD4-induced activation of Rac. The fact that we also found that LTD4 had the ability to cause activation of Akt, a well known downstream target of PI3K, further supports our conclusion that LTD4 causes the activation of PI3K in intestinal epithelial Int 407 cells. In keeping with these results, a requirement of PI3K activity for the agonist-induced activation of Rac has also been reported in other cell systems (5.Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It is likely that the PI3K dependence in these experiments is related to the fact that the PI3K-generated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate lipid enables the activation of a number of Rac-specific GEFs (14.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Vav2 seems to be the GEF involved in the activation of Rac by LTD4, because not only does it contain a PH domain and is therefore a target of the PI3K lipid product, we also found that Vav2 was tyrosinephosphorylated, indicative of its activation. In addition, the LTD4-induced activation of Rac was totally blocked in intestinal epithelial 407 cells transfected with a dominant-negative form of Vav2. In this study, we found that stimulation of Int 407 cells with LTD4 led to the formation of circular membrane ruffles rather than the classical Rac-induced lamellipodia (37.Mohri T. Adachi Y. Ikehara S. Hioki K. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This observation was somehow surprising, because circular membrane ruffle formation has mainly been described in response to different growth factors and we have previously shown that stimulation of Int 407 cells with LTD4 does not result in a transactivation of either EGF or platelet-derived growth factor receptors (30.Massoumi R. Nielsen C.K. Azemovic D. Sjölander A. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although we cannot totally rule out the possibility of a cross-talk between the Cyst-LT1-receptor and alternative growth factor receptors, we do believe that our present results reflect a direct effect of the Cys-LT1-receptor on the cytoskeleton. Several findings support the view that the activation of PI3K and its downstream effector Rac mediate the LTD4-stimulated membrane ruffling in Int 407 cells. First, decreased formation of membrane ruffles was observed in LTD4-stimulated Int 407 cells pretreated with LY294002 or wortmannin as well as in cells transiently transfected with a dominant-negative (N17) mutant of Rac. Secondly, we observed that Rac redistributed to a membrane-enriched fraction upon stimulation of the cells with LTD4. Thirdly, we found that Rac co-localized with filamentous actin in the membrane ruffles of cells stimulated with LTD4. Furthermore, our conclusion is also indirectly supported by the observation that expression of constitutively active Rac1 results in the formation of membrane ruffles in colon cancer cells (37.Mohri T. Adachi Y. Ikehara S. Hioki K. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of dominant-negative Rac1 constructs into epithelial cells (33.Fenteany G. Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) or rat embryo fibroblasts (34.Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) has been shown to inhibit both the formation of lamellipodia and migration of cells into the wound. Activation of distinct Rho family proteins constitutes key signaling events that link ligation of membrane receptors to cytoskeletal reorganization. For the first time, we show here that stimulation of human intestinal epithelial cells with LTD4 leads to a transient and time-dependent activation of Rac but not Cdc42. This finding is similar to the observation in vascular smooth muscle cells where angiotensin and thrombin stimulation have been shown to result in the activation of Rac but not Cdc42 (38.Pelletier S. Duhamel F. Coulombe P. Popoff M.R. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1316-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of agonists that cause activation of Rac also cause a simultaneous activation of Cdc42 in their target cells (39.Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

In the present study, we could clearly show that the LTD4-induced migratory response in intestinal epithelial Int 407 cells was significantly impaired by PTX, LY294002, and wortmannin, all of which have been shown to also block the LTD4-mediated activation of Rac. Taken together, our results support the notion that LTD4 generates the formation of circular membrane ruffles via a PI3K and Rac signaling pathway and that the formation of these ruffles serves as an important driving force for the LTD4-induced migration of intestinal epithelial cells. Cell migration is central to several important biological processes including tissue morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer cell metastasis (41.Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). Our previous results demonstrating that the pro-inflammatory mediator LTD4 can induce significant increases in proliferation and survival (27.Smalley W.E. Du Bois R.N. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) can now be extended by the present finding that it also increases the motility of these cells, all hallmarks of tumor cell behavior. Consequently, the present results add further support for an important role of LTD4 as a link between inflammatory bowel diseases and subsequent development of colon cancer."

Telomeres, specialized nucleoprotein structures at the ends of linear DNA molecules, are crucial for both proper replication of the chromosomal ends and their protection against inappropriate DNA repair, end-to-end fusions, and exonucleolytic degradation (1McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 255: 331-358Crossref Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 2de Lange T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although telomerase, the enzyme responsible for telomere maintenance in most circumstances, has received the most attention (3Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 4Bryan T.M. Cech T.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), there is increasing interest in telomere elongation mediated through telomerase-independent mechanisms (5Lundblad V.

Recombination appears to maintain telomeres in a wide variety of circumstances, including yeast mutants deleted for telomerase, native chromosomal or mitochondrial telomeres in some species, and a significant minority of human cancers, where the phenomenon is called Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (10Reddel R.R. Bryan T.M. Lancet. 2003; 361: 1840-1841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Extrachromosomal copies of telomeric sequence, often known to be in a circular form (designated t (telomeric)-circles), 1The abbreviations used are: t-circle, telomeric circle; EM, electron microscopy; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. have been found in a wide variety of organisms, including yeasts, plants, amphibians, and certain mammalian cells (9Tomaska L. McEachern M.J. Nosek J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Originally, they were related to endogenous and induced genomic instability in mammalian cells (11Regev A. Cohen S. Cohen E. Bar-Am I. Lavi S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3455-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Later, results from our laboratories indicated that t-circles are active players in telomere maintenance (12Tomaska L. Nosek J. Makhov A.M. Pastorakova A. Griffith J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4479-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the case of Kluyveromyces lactis, t-circles have been shown to directly promote recombinational telomere elongation (13Natarajan S. McEachern M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4512-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Natarajan S. Groff-Vindman C. McEachern M.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, synthetic DNA nanocircles composed of human telomeric repeats can act as essentially infinite catalytic templates for efficient synthesis of long telomeres by conventional DNA polymerase (15Lindstrom U.M. Chandrasekaran R.A. Orbai L. Helquist S.A. Miller G.P. Oroudjev E. Hansma H.G. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15953-15958Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A role of t-circles in telomere maintenance was originally proposed for a natural telomerase-deficient system of mitochondria of the yeast Candida parapsilosis (12Tomaska L. Nosek J. Makhov A.M. Pastorakova A. Griffith J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4479-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ends of its linear mitochondrial genome consist of tandem arrays of a 738-bp-long repetitive unit and a 5′ single-stranded overhang of about 110 nucleotides (Fig. 1A) (16Nosek J. Dinouel N. Kovac L. Fukuhara H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoretic and electron microscopic (EM) analyses demonstrated the presence of minicircular DNA molecules derived exclusively from the telomeric sequence (12Tomaska L. Nosek J. Makhov A.M. Pastorakova A. Griffith J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4479-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Importantly, two recent papers demonstrated that human alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) cells have abundant t-circles, pointing to their potential role in promoting telomere replication in the absence of telomerase (17Cesare A.J. Griffith J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9948-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18Wang R.C. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 2004; 119: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). However, experimental evidence that naturally occurring t-circles are employed as substrates for amplification of telomeric arrays in vivo is lacking. Mitochondrial t-circles are present as series of integral multiples of the tandem repeat unit. It was suggested that they are not only by-products of recombination between telomeric tandem repeat units but that they also may serve as templates to promote recombinational telomere elongation. This would imply that the t-circles amplify independently of the main mitochondrial chromosome, leading to de novo generation of extrachromosomal telomeric sequences that would be integrated back at the mtDNA termini. To test this hypothesis, we employed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and EM to search for intermediates generated during replication of the mitochondrial t-circles. In this report we provide the first evidence that t-circles replicate via a rolling-circle strategy, thus pointing to their active participation in the dynamics of telomeric tandem repeats and amplification of extrachromosomal telomeric arrays in vivo. In addition, these results have implications for evolution of telomeric tandem arrays in chromosomes of early eukaryotes. Yeast Strain and Oligonucleotides—C. parapsilosis SR23 (CBS 7157) is a laboratory strain from the collection of the Department of Biochemistry, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia. Strains MCO471 and MCO448 were kindly provided by P. F. Lehmann (Medical College of Ohio, Toledo). TEL51 (5′-TAGGGATTGATTATTTACCTATATATTATCAATTATATTAAACGATAATA-3′) represents the sequence of the last 51 nucleotides from the 5′-overhang of the extreme end of C. parapsilosis mtDNA (16Nosek J. Dinouel N. Kovac L. Fukuhara H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and Oligo2 (5′-GTATTTATTTCTTATTCATTCTTCATTAGAAC-3′) is derived from the same strand of the telomeric repeat unit. TEL51C and Oligo2C are complementary to TEL51 and Oligo2, respectively (Fig. 1, A and C). DNA Manipulations—C. parapsilosis was grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% glucose) on a rotary shaker at 30 °C to mid-log phase. The cells were then harvested, resuspended in 0.1% sodium azide, 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and incubated for 10 min on ice. Subsequently, the cells were collected by centrifugation and total DNA was isolated as described (19Philippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Neutral-neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Brewer and Fangman (20Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1988; 55: 637-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) with slight modifications outlined in Ref. 12Tomaska L. Nosek J. Makhov A.M. Pastorakova A. Griffith J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4479-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. Enzymatic DNA manipulations, DNA cloning, Southern blotting, and DNA labeling and hybridization were performed according to Ref. 21Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001Google Scholar. The t-circles were cloned as restriction enzyme fragments (EcoRI (SR23; 738 bp), EcoRV (MCO448; 620 bp), and ClaI (MCO471; 777 bp)) into corresponding sites of pUC/pTZ plasmid vectors, and their sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. The nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the GenBank™ with accession numbers AY468377 (SR23), AY468378 (MCO448), and AY468379 (MCO471). In Organello Replication Assay—Freshly prepared mitochondria (0.3 ml) (12Tomaska L. Nosek J. Makhov A.M. Pastorakova A. Griffith J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4479-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were mixed on ice with 40 μl of buffer L (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm pyruvate, 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 10 mm NADH, 10 mm malate, 20 mm KCl), 40 μl of 0.8 m sucrose, 40 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 40 μl of 20 mm ATP, and 40 μl of 150 μm dTTP, dGTP, dATP. The reaction was started by addition of 5 μl of [α-32P]dCTP and immediately placed in a 22 °C waterbath. 90-μl aliquots were taken at 0, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min, mixed with 90 μl of 2× mito-lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm EDTA-NaOH (pH 8.0), 2% sarcosyl) and incubated for 10 min at 65 °C followed by 10 min on ice. After addition of 220 μl of 1× mito-lysis buffer, 2 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) were added and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Each sample was extracted once with phenol:chloroform (1:1), followed by incubation with 50 μg/ml RNase A for 15 min at 37 °C. The samples were extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (25:24:1). DNA was ethanol precipitated and the vacuum-dried pellet was solubilized in 50 μl of double-distilled water. The samples (7 μl) were digested with a restriction enzyme, and resulting fragments were separated either by onedimensional electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel (21Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001Google Scholar) or two-dimensional electrophoresis (12Tomaska L. Nosek J. Makhov A.M. Pastorakova A. Griffith J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4479-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Fractionation of mtDNA on Propidium Iodide-CsCl Gradient—The mitochondrial pellet (0.5 ml) was lysed with 4.5 ml of the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA-NaOH, 1% sarcosyl) and incubated for 10 min on ice. After addition of proteinase K (Sigma) to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by two extractions with equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (25:24:1). The deproteinized sample was treated for 20 min at 37 °C with RNase A (100 μg/ml) and re-extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol. The nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol, and the resulting pellets were dried under vacuum and solubilized in 4 ml of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA-NaOH) containing 0.6 mg/ml propidium iodide. CsCl (3.34 g) was added, and the sample was centrifuged for 23 h at 55,000 rpm in a T863B rotor at 15 °C. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. Propidium iodide was removed by Dowex A50 (Sigma) (21Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001Google Scholar). The resulting samples were diluted with two volumes of TE, and DNA was precipitated with ethanol and solubilized with 150 μl of TE. 20 μl of the resulting DNA samples were used for Southern blot hybridization and EM. Electron Microscopy—Preparation of the DNAs for EM is described in Refs. 22Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar and 23Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar. A Philips CM12 was used at 40 kV. Images on film were scanned using a Nikon LS4500 film scanner and the contrast adjusted using Adobe Photoshop software. Escherichia coli SSB protein was purified as described (24Chase J.W. Whittier R.F. Auerbach J. Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3215-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A plasmid pGEMEX-1 (Invitrogen) was used as an internal standard. When undigested DNA of C. parapsilosis is subjected to neutral-neutral two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, there is a relatively high number of circular double-stranded DNA molecules composed of exclusively telomeric sequences whose sizes correspond to integral multiples of the telomeric tandem repeat unit (738 bp). This is exemplified in Fig. 1B, where hybridization was performed with the probe derived from a 738-bp EcoRI restriction fragment corresponding to the telomeric repeat unit. In addition to double-stranded t-circles, the hybridization revealed the presence of an additional class of fast-migrating DNA molecules of heterogeneous sizes (Fig. 1B). These DNAs were also present when the blot was hybridized with the oligonucleotides TEL51C and Oligo2C derived from two different regions of the telomeric unit and, thus, t-circle sequence. In contrast, the fast-migrating DNA species were absent when the same blot was probed with complementary oligonucleotides TEL51 and Oligo2. The fact that these molecules are detected only with TEL51C/Oligo2C and not with TEL51/Oligo2 suggests that they (i) have a single-stranded nature, (ii) are derived from the same strand of DNA, and (iii) might represent replication intermediates that would be typically generated by a strand displacement synthesis such as rolling-circle replication of t-circles (Fig. 1C). To obtain samples that would be enriched for these intermediates, we employed a propidium iodide-CsCl gradient that was originally used for buoyant separations of various forms of φX174 DNA (25Fukuda A. J. Biochem. 1976; 80: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The fractions from the gradient were subjected to Southern blot analysis with the TEL51 and TEL51C probes (Fig. 2A). Double-stranded telomeric DNA circles hybridizing to both probes were found within the lower part of the tube (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). Molecules with higher buoyant density contained mostly ssDNAs hybridizing to TEL51C (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7). A small portion of the molecules in these fractions hybridized to both oligonucleotides, suggesting their double-stranded nature (Fig. 2A, lane 7). The length of the DNAs was highly heterogeneous, starting at ∼0.75 kbp (the size of the smallest t-circle) and reaching several kbp. To directly visualize DNA molecules present in the fraction with high buoyant density, the sample was analyzed by EM. The single-stranded regions were stained with ssDNA-binding protein from E. coli. As indicated by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2A), the fraction contained a high concentration of long ssDNA molecules of various sizes (data not shown). More importantly, about 50 lasso-shaped double-stranded DNA molecules with a single-stranded region at the junction between the circle and the tail (Fig. 2B) were scored. The other fractions from the gradient did not contain this type of molecule. The structures observed could be due to various types of DNA transactions. For example, the unique recombinational single-step deletion process termed telomere rapid deletion may shorten telomeres through an intratelomeric loop intermediate (7Lustig A.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Li B. Lustig A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1310-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Another related possibility might be a strand invasion to form a protective t-loop structure (23Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 27Tomaska L. Makhov A.M. Griffith J.D. Nosek J. Mitochondrion. 2002; 1: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which might even occur with extrachromosomal telomeric pieces. However, the heterogeneous sizes of the “tails”, relatively large ssDNA regions at the circle/tail junction, and observation of the structures in preparations not treated with psoralen (required to visualize telomeric loops) strongly argue that the molecular architecture observed represents a typical intermediate of rolling-circle replication (28Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 298-300Google Scholar). The above results indicate that the telomeric region of mtDNA of C. parapsilosis is highly dynamic and might represent a hot spot for DNA transactions such as DNA replication and/or recombination. To address this hypothesis experimentally, we performed in organello DNA replication assays on purified C. parapsilosis mitochondria. After initiation of the reaction by addition of [α-32P]dCTP, aliquots were taken at 0, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min, and DNA was isolated and digested with BglII, HindIII, PvuII, and XbaI endonucleases, allowing discrimination between telomeric and internal restriction enzyme fragments of the mtDNA (Fig. 3A). Autoradiography of a conventional agarose gel with separated mtDNA fragments revealed that the majority of the radioactive label was incorporated into the telomeric regions of the mtDNA (Fig. 3, B and C). Importantly, two-dimensional electrophoresis of the BglII-digested mtDNA revealed two labeled populations of DNA fragments corresponding to t-circles and a fast-migrating ssDNA species, respectively, suggesting that displacement DNA synthesis of t-circles is involved in de novo synthesis of telomeric DNA (Fig. 3D). Although the proportion of labeled t-circles is relatively low (indicating their slow de novo formation), there is a high abundance of fast-migrating DNA species (reflecting a high rate of rolling-circle amplification). The DNA species observed are similar to those detected by Southern blot analysis of BglII-digested mtDNA hybridized with an EcoRI-EcoRI telomeric fragment (Fig. 3E). These results demonstrate that mitochondrial telomeres of C. parapsilosis are preferential sites of de novo DNA synthesis and/or recombination, which is in line with a potential role of rolling-circle replication of t-circles in telomere maintenance. A recent survey of several strains of C. parapsilosis revealed that an intraspecific variability affects the sequence of the telomeric tandem repeat motifs (29Rycovska A. Valach M. Tomaska L. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Nosek J. Microbiology (UK). 2004; 150: 1571-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast to the strain SR23 employed in the present study, the telomeric repeat in the strain MCO448 is significantly shorter (620 bp in MCO448 versus 738 bp in SR23). To demonstrate that the size of the telomeric repeat corresponds to the size of the t-circles, circular DNA molecules were isolated from mitochondria of MCO448 by the alkaline lysis method (12Tomaska L. Nosek J. Makhov A.M. Pastorakova A. Griffith J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4479-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and subjected to EM analysis. The population of purified t-circles consisted of DNA molecules whose size ranged between ∼600 and 5600 bp, corresponding to 1–9 multimers of the 620-bp-long telomeric repeat (Fig. 4). Next, in silico analysis was performed to define critical regions responsible for the dynamics of t-circles of C. parapsilosis. It revealed the presence of four palindromic sequences that may be involved in promoting rolling-circle replication (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the position of the 5′-end of the mitochondrial chromosome corresponds to the base of palindrome 3, which may represent a potential site for a specific nick during opening of a t-circle prior to rolling-circle synthesis. Moreover, the t-circle sequence contains a cytosine-rich domain (C-box) that is a candidate for a hot spot implicated in recombinational transactions at telomeric arrays. Furthermore, a guanine-rich domain (G-box) localized at the boundary of the 554-bp subterminal repeat and the tandem array (Fig. 1A) may be also implicated in these events. To identify general features of the t-circles that might be important for their function, we cloned and sequenced t-circles from the strains of C. parapsilosis differing in size of telomeric repeats and corresponding t-circles (i.e. 738 bp in SR23, 620 bp in MCO448, and 777 bp in MCO471). A comparison of their sequences (Fig. 5B) revealed that all four palindromes and the C-box found in the strain SR23 are highly conserved among all three variants, indicating biological significance of these motifs. Covariation of bases in palindrome 1 further supports this idea. In addition to the strains with altered sequence of the terminal tandem repeat, the survey of C. parapsilosis isolates revealed mutants with a circularized form of the mitochondrial genome. The conversion of linear to circular mtDNA was due to fusion of termini of the linear molecules that was accompanied by deletion of a significant fraction of the telomeric sequence with a concomitant loss of mitochondrial t-circles (29Rycovska A. Valach M. Tomaska L. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Nosek J. Microbiology (UK). 2004; 150: 1571-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Elimination of t-circles might have caused a defect in the telomere maintenance pathway that has been evaded by circularization of the genophore. This would imply that the t-circle-dependent pathway may represent the main, or even the only, mode of telomere maintenance in C. parapsilosis mitochondria. These results, together with studies on nuclear telomeres of K. lactis and Xenopus laevis (13Natarajan S. McEachern M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4512-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Cohen S. Mechali M. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), imply that t-circles are not simply by-products of recombination transactions within the tandem arrays but play an important role in a telomere maintenance pathway. Rolling-circle replication of the t-circles generates elongated stretches of telomeric repeats that may be incised back at the chromosomal ends. A wide occurrence of t-circles in both nuclear and mitochondrial compartments argues that an excision-expansion-incision cycle undergone by t-circles provides a general, telomerase-independent mode of telomere maintenance (9Tomaska L. McEachern M.J. Nosek J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Replication of linear mitochondrial genomes (31Nosek J. Tomaska L. Fukuhara H. Suyama Y. Kovac L. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) therefore provides a paradigm for evolution of telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes. Considering their eubacterial origin (32Martin W. Russell M.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 59-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), mitochondria of C. parapsilosis, as a natural telomerase-deficient system of telomere replication, may be solving the end-replication problem by an evolutionary ancient mechanism preceding telomerase. This is in line with a recent hypothesis that nuclear telomere functions were originally mediated by telomeric loops (8de Lange T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

As mitochondrial telomeres seem to fulfill analogous biological functions and display all the essential features of their nuclear counterparts, i.e. they consist of arrays of tandem repeats and possess a protruding single-stranded overhang (16Nosek J.

Telomeres, Telomerases, and Cancer. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2002: 396-417Google Scholar). Telomeric loops seem to represent a general, evolutionary conserved property of terminal tandem arrays and may explain several telomere-related phenomena such as capping function, masking the ends from DNA repair machinery providing a solution to the end-replication problem, and telomere rapid deletion (7Lustig A.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8de Lange T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, their formation requires pre-existing and sufficiently long arrays of terminal repeats. Our results indicate that displacement mode of DNA synthesis at t-circles generates long tandem arrays of the telomeric sequence that may recombine with the linear DNA molecules to lengthen the termini (9Tomaska L. McEachern M.J. Nosek J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). From the evolutionary point of view it is important to note that the rolling-circle replication strategy is common among various replicons in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Telomeres thus may have evolved from a selfish element functionally related to the t-circles that integrated into primitive eukaryotic, presumably circular, genome, forced its conversion toward a linear form, and produced amplified tandem arrays at its termini (37Nosek J. Tomaska L. Curr. Genet. 2003; 44: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expanded telomeric arrays subsequently might have allowed formation of the telomeric loop structures. Telomerase might have come later, outcompeted ancient mechanism(s), and provided a more robust mechanism for the maintenance of telomeres in eukaryotic nuclei. Therefore, in addition to their significance for understanding the details of alternative lengthening of telomere pathways, the results presented here have evolutionary implications related to the primordial system of nuclear telomere maintenance.

https://openalex.org/W2029320528,"DNA fragmentation/degradation is an important step for apoptosis. However, in unicellular organisms such as yeast, this process has rarely been investigated. In the current study, we revealed eight apoptotic nuclease candidates in Saccharyomyces cerevisiae, analogous to the Caenorhabditis elegans apoptotic nucleases. One of them is Tat-D. Sequence comparison indicates that Tat-D is conserved across kingdoms, implicating that it is evolutionarily and functionally indispensable. In order to better understand the biochemical and biological functions of Tat-D, we have overexpressed, purified, and characterized the S. cerevisiae Tat-D (scTat-D). Our biochemical assays revealed that scTat-D is an endo-/exonuclease. It incises the double-stranded DNA without obvious specificity via its endonuclease activity and excises the DNA from the 3′- to 5′-end by its exonuclease activity. The enzyme activities are metal-dependent with Mg2+ as an optimal metal ion and an optimal pH around 5. We have also identified three amino acid residues, His185, Asp325, and Glu327, important for its catalysis. In addition, our study demonstrated that knock-out of TAT-D in S. cerevisiae increases the TUNEL-positive cells and cell survival in response to hydrogen hyperoxide treatment, whereas overexpression of Tat-D facilitates cell death.

Failure of this process could lead to developmental defects, immunological and neuro-degenerative disorders, and formation of cancers in mammals and other higher organisms (7Kawane K. Fukuyama H.

So far, at least three nucleases have been well characterized to play a role in DNA degradation for apoptosis, including DFF40/CAD, Cps-6/endonuclease G, and Nuc 1/DNase II (11Liu X. Li P. Widlak P.

Of the three nucleases, DFF40/CAD is caspase-dependent, whereas the other two are caspase-independent. More recently, seven additional nucleases have been identified for apoptosis in Caenorhabditis elegans, including Crn-1/FEN-1 and Crn-2/Tat-D (19Parrish J.Z. Xue D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 987-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Further analysis indicated that Crn-1/FEN-1, a flap endo- and 5′ to 3′ exonuclease critical for DNA replication, repair, and recombination (20Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev.

Evidence is accumulating that apoptosis also exists in unicellular organisms, such as in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (21Burhans W.C. Weinberger M. Marchetti M.A. Ramachandran L. D'Urso G.

Biol. 2002; 12: 233-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) can also induce apoptosis in yeast cells. Dying yeast cells under these conditions display several markers that are characteristic of apoptosis. These include the rapid exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer cell membrane, the margination of chromatin in nuclei, nuclear fragmentation, and the degradation of DNA. Exposure of the cells to the protein translation inhibitor, cycloheximide, prevents these death-associated changes, indicating that the death response requires active protein synthesis (29Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Although yeast has been a good model system for apoptotic studies (34Manon S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the process and mechanism of apoptotic DNA fragmentation/degradation in yeast has rarely been investigated. It is unclear which nucleases are involved in yeast apoptosis. To gain knowledge on apoptotic nucleases in yeast cells, we started with a comprehensive homology search based on presently available information on apoptotic nucleases of multicellular organisms, including caspase-dependent DFF40/CAD and caspase-independent nucleases, such as Cps-6/endo-nuclease G, Nuc-1/DNase IIa, Crn-1/FEN-1, Crn-2/Tat-D, Crn-3/PM/ScI-100, Crn-4/RNase T, Crn-5/Rrp46, Crn-6/DNase IIb, Cyp-13/Cyp E, DNase I, and DNase γ. The search resulted in eight candidate nucleases for yeast apoptotic DNA fragmentation/degradation, which correspond to the above listed except for DFF40/CAD, Nuc-1/DNase IIa, DNase I, and DNase γ. Among the eight potential apoptotic nucleases in yeast, Tat-D appears most conserved. It exists in organisms across all kingdoms. However, the biochemical and biological functions of Tat-D are still poorly understood. Tat-D was first implicated in Schizosaccharomyces pombe to have a role in spindle elongation and chromosome decondensation during progression of late anaphase (35Samejima I. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1655-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It was later, however, considered to be an integral membrane component of the Sec-independent protein export complex that is the so-called twin arginine translocation (Tat) system in Escherichia coli (36Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Further analysis indicated that Tat-D is actually a DNase rather than a membrane protein (37Wexler M. Sargent F. Jack R.L. Stanley N.R. Bogsch E.G. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16717-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the recent finding that Tat-D has a role in apoptotic DNA degradation in C. elegans (19Parrish J.Z. Xue D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 987-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the current study, we characterized the biochemical functions of Tat-D using purified yeast recombinant Tat-D protein and determined its role in apoptotic DNA degradation in yeast cells. Tat-D was revealed to be a metal-dependent endo-/exonuclease with optimal activities under acidic conditions. The TAT-D gene knock-out in yeast has an insignificant effect on cell growth and DNA repair but shows alteration in apoptosis induced by hydrogen superoxide. Furthermore, overexpression of Tat-D in yeast cells facilitates cell death. These results indicate that Tat-D is involved in yeast apoptosis. Protein Blast Search and Sequence Alignment—For the protein Blast search, we obtained nine C. elegans (Cps-6 Nuc 1, Crn-1, Crn-2, Crn-3, Crn-4, Crn-5, Crn-6, and Cyp-13) and three human (DFF40/CAD, DNase I, and DNase γ) nuclease proteins as query elements. We searched their counterparts in the S. cerevisiae data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.yeastgenome.org). In addition, we searched for all of the available Tat-D homologues in the NCBI data base using Crn-2 protein as the query sequence. The relevant proteins were aligned, and their sequence similarities were calculated using the ClustalW 1.8 multiple sequence alignment algorithm at the BCM Search Launcher, Baylor College of Medicine HGSC (available on the World Wide Web at searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu). Protein Overexpression, Purification, and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The ScTAT-D DNA fragment was generated by PCR using S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and the primers listed in Table I. The DNA fragment was then inserted into the pET-28b overexpression vector. The three mutant proteins created for this study were prepared using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and with primers listed in Table I. The pET-28b plasmid with the insertion of yTAT-D DNA was used as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis, overexpression, and purification of wild type and mutant FEN-1 enzymes were carried out based on our previously published procedures (38Qiu J. Qian Y. Frank P.

Oligonucleotides used to construct the substrates are listed in Table I. Briefly, oligonucleotides shown in the figures were individually phosphorylated at the 5′-end. This was done by incubating 40 pmol of the oligonucleotide with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μl (10 units/μl) of polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 60 min. Polynucleotide kinase was then inactivated by heating at 72 °C for 10 min. 80 pmol of each remaining oligonucleotide comprising the substrates were added to the labeled oligonucleotides. The samples were incubated at 70 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to 25 °C, thus allowing the oligonucleotides to anneal and form the flap and nick-duplex substrates. Substrates were precipitated at -20 °C overnight after adding 20 μl of 3 m NaOAc and 1 ml of 100% ethanol. Substrates were collected by centrifugation and washed once with 70% ethanol and resuspended in sterile water. Reactions were carried out with the indicated amount of ScTat-D and 0.1 or 0.2 μm of DNA substrates in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 or 5 mm MgCl2. Each reaction was then brought to a total volume of 10 μl with water. All reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated by adding an equal volume of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). An aliquot of each reaction was then run on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 1900 V for 1 h. The gel was dried at 70 °C for 50 min, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. Yeast Strains and Gene Disruption—Two yeast strains, RKY2672 and BY4741, were used for the disruption of ScTAT-D. The gene was knocked out using the PCR-mediated gene disruption method (41Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropopulous O. Deanouel A LaCroute F Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar, 42Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Heitman J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We used the plasmid pFA6a-KanMX4 (kindly provided by Dr. K. Kuchler) for amplifying the marker gene, Kanr. A DNA fragment of the marker gene flanked on the upstream side by a 53-bp upstream sequence of ScTAT-D and on the downstream side by a 53-bp downstream sequence of ScTAT-D was produced by PCR and used to transform yeast cells as indicated. The transformed cells were plated on selection medium, YPD with 200 μg/ml G418. ScTAT-D disruption was confirmed by PCR for the G418-resistant colonies. The RKY2672-based strains were used to examine the spontaneous mutation status due to the disruption of ScTAT-D. The By4741-based strains were used for assays on cell growth and survival rate with H2O2, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and annexin V staining and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) 1The abbreviations used are: TUNEL, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. assays. Yeast Cell Survival Tests—Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium overnight and adjusted to identical density at A600. The cells were diluted by 100 times and grown in 10 ml of YPD medium until they reached exponential phase (A600 = 0.6). H2O2 was added to the desired concentrations. After a 2-h treatment with H2O2, cells were washed twice with distilled water, and the sample volume was adjusted to 5 ml. Cells treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 6 mm H2O2 were diluted by 4000, 2000, 1000, and 500 times, respectively. 100 μl of diluted sample was plated onto YPD plates. The number of surviving colonies was determined after a 2-day incubation at 30 °C. The survival rate was calculated using the number of colonies with H2O2 treatment, multiplying by the dilutions during cell plating, and dividing by the number of control cells (without H2O2 treatment). Assays were repeated three times. TUNEL Assays on Yeast Cells—The procedure for the TUNEL assay follows Madeo et al. (29Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to early log phase (A600 = 0.6), and hydrogen superoxide was then added with the indicated amounts in Fig. 7. After 2 h, cells were fixed by adding 3.7% formaldehyde into the cell cultures. Cells were fixed for at least 1 h and then collected, washed, and digested with lyticase. The digested cells were applied to a polylysine-coated slide as described for immunofluorescence (43Adams A.E. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The slides were rinsed with PBS and incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidases. The slides were further rinsed with PBS, incubated in permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice, rinsed twice with PBS, incubated with 10 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 200 units/ml, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dUTP 10 mm, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm sodium cacodylate, 5 mm cobalt chloride; Roche Applied Science) for 60 min at 37 °C, and then rinsed 3 times with PBS. For the detection of peroxidase, cells were incubated with 10 μl of Converter-POD (anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody, Fab fragment from sheep, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase) for 30 min at 37 °C, rinsed three times with PBS, and then stained with DAB-substrate solution (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min at room temperature. A coverslip was mounted with a drop of Kaiser's glycerol gelatin (Merck). Since staining intensity varies, only samples from the same slide were compared. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was performed as described previously (25Madeo F. Frohlich E. Frohlich K.U. J.

Presence of Potential Apoptotic Nucleases in Yeast—In order to identify apoptotic nucleases in yeast cells, we performed a Blast search using the yeast protein data base based on 12 known apoptotic nucleases so far identified from multicellular organisms as query sequences. The 12 known nucleases are listed in Table II, including DFF40/CAD, Cps-6/endonuclease G, Nuc-1/DNase IIa, Crn-1/FEN-1, Crn-2/Tat-D, Crn-3/PM/ScI-100, Crn-4/RNase T, Crn-5/Rrp46, Crn-6/DNase IIb, Cyp-13/Cyp E, DNase I, and DNase γ. Most of them are recently screened from C. elegans. After an extensive search, no homologue of DFF40/CAD in yeast cells was found, although this is considered the critical caspase-dependent nuclease in multicellular organisms, such as mammals and Drosophila. Among the other nucleases, eight nucleases have their homologues in yeast cells, including Cps-6/endonuclease G, Crn-1/FEN-1, Crn-2/Tat-D, Crn-3/PM/SCI-100, Crn-4/RNase T, Crn-5/Rrp46, Crn-6/DNase IIb, and Cyp-13/Cyp E (Table II). Except for Crn-2/Tat-D, Crn-3/PM/SCI-100, and Crn-6/DNase IIb, the remaining five nucleases were shown to form a degradesome in C. elegans (19Parrish J.Z. Xue D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 987-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Since Cps-6/endonuclease G is translocated from the mitochondrion to the nucleus during apoptosis (14Parrish J. Li L. Klotz K. Ledwich D. Wang X. Xue D.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3451-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), its DNA fragmentation/degradation is mitochondrion-dependent. This pathway may play a critical role in yeast apoptosis due to the absence of DFF40/CAD endonuclease in yeast cells. The absence of DFF40/CAD is in accordance with the previous finding that yeast cells lack some classical apoptotic elements, including BCL-2 family members and caspases.Table IIPutative yeast (S. cerevisae) apoptotic nucleases corresponding to those revealed in multicellular organismsPreviously proposed apoptotic nucleasesIdentified or possible activitiesCorresponding proteinsSimilarityaProtein sequence similarity between C. elegans and yeast proteinsHumanC. elegansYeast%Cps-6/endonuclease GbSummarized from Ref. 19Endonuclease+c+, presence++57Nuc1/DnaseIIabSummarized from Ref. 19Endonuclease++-d-, absenceCrn-1/FEN-1bSummarized from Ref. 19Flap endonuclease and (possibly) exonuclease+++73Crn-2/Tat-DbSummarized from Ref. 19Nuclease+++55Crn-3/PM/ScI-100bSummarized from Ref. 19Ribonuclease+++53Crn-4/RNaseTbSummarized from Ref. 19Ribonuclease+++39Crn-5/Rrp46bSummarized from Ref. 19Ribonuclease+++48Crn-6/DNase IIbbSummarized from Ref. 19Endonuclease++-33Cyp13/CypEbSummarized from Ref. 19Nuclease+++63DFF40/CADEndonuclease+--DNase IEndonuclease+--DNase γEndonuclease+--a Protein sequence similarity between C. elegans and yeast proteinsb Summarized from Ref. 19Parrish J.Z.

We searched all of the available Tat-D protein sequences from the National Institutes of Health protein data base and revealed that more than 31 organisms have their Tat-D sequence information. These organisms cover all the kingdoms from Archaeabacteria, Eubacteria to eukaryotes, indicating that Tat-D is evolutionarily selected and could have important biological functions. Fig. 1A shows the protein sequence alignment of Tat-D homologues from 12 representative organisms. The alignment identified 21 amino acid residues identical among different Tat-D proteins (indicated by the asterisks in Fig. 1A). Of these residues, five are negatively charged, which could be important for Tat-D catalysis, and five others are positively charged, possibly important for substrate binding. Because the conserved amino acid residues are scattered along the protein sequence, no clear motifs could be defined for Tat-D catalysis or substrate binding without further information on its three-dimensional structure. Nevertheless, a motif close to the C terminus, marked by a box in Fig. 1A, might be evolved for subcellular localization, since the motif sequence appears only in the eukaryotic cells. It contains multiple positively charged amino acid residues, which is similar to the nuclear localization signal of nuclear proteins such as FEN-1 (45Qiu J. Li X.W. Frank G. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30909-30914Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships among the 12 Tat-D proteins based on the above aligned sequences. Overall, the tree exhibits an evolutionary trend from lower to higher organisms. The bacterial Tat-Ds are more ancestral except for E. coli Tat-D that groups with C. elegans. In eukaryotes, the two yeast Tat-Ds are more ancestral to those from mammalian, plant, and fruit fly. This result indicates that Tat-D is evolutionarily conserved, possibly due to its important biological functions. Purified Yeast Tat-D Has a Nuclease Activity—In order to better understand the biochemical and biological roles of Tat-D, we cloned the S. cerevisiae TAT-D gene, overexpressed it, and purified its protein (ScTat-D) to homogeneity (Fig. 2A). Although the overall overexpression level was low in the BL21 (DE3) expression system, the His-tagged protein is soluble and can be purified through a nickel column. As shown in Fig. 2A, the purified protein is about 45 kDa in size. We then tested whether this protein could cleave circular plasmid DNA, which would allow us to easily determine whether it has endonuclease activity. Our result shows that ScTat-D can efficiently degrade plasmid DNA, indicating that ScTat-D is a DNase (Fig. 2B). This result implies that Tat-D could be a candidate for apoptotic DNA degradation. Tat-D Has Both Endonuclease Activity Making Random Cleavages and Exonuclease Activity Excising from 3′ to 5′—To reveal the cleavage pattern of ScTat-D endonuclease activity and to determine if the enzyme also has an exonuclease activity, we used single-stranded or blunt end double-stranded DNA substrates labeled at the 5′- or 3′-end. Fig. 3A shows the DNA cleavage pattern of ScTat-D using substrates labeled at the 5′-end. Clearly, ScTat-D has enzyme activity on both the double- and single-stranded substrates, whereas the activity on the single-stranded DNA is at least 20 times weaker that on the double-stranded substrate. In addition, the cleavage pattern could rule out the 5′ to 3′ enzyme activity, since no single nucleotides were cut from the 5′-end. Once the endonuclease activity cleaves, the products could be substrates suitable for exonuclease activity as well. Fig. 3B shows the DNA cleavage pattern of ScTat-D using substrates labeled at the 3′-end. It is clear that ScTat-D makes a strong excision at the 3′-end. The activity on the double-stranded substrate is about 5 times stronger than that on the single-stranded substrate. This result suggests that ScTat-D has 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity. To confirm that ScTat-D has both endo- and exonuclease activities, we performed nuclease activity assays based on a substrate with a biotin at the 3′-end. Since the biotin is able to interact with streptavidin, we used it to block the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of ScTat-D in the presence of bound streptavidin. Our result (Fig. 4A) shows that with increasing amounts of streptavidin, the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of ScTat-D was completely abolished, whereas its endonuclease activity was not affected. This result indicates that Sc"

The c-Abl tyrosine kinase is also involved in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. The present results demonstrate that c-Abl binds directly to caspase-9. We show that c-Abl phosphorylates caspase-9 on Tyr-153 in vitro and in cells treated with DNA damaging agents. Moreover, inhibition of c-Abl with STI571 blocked DNA damage-induced autoprocessing of caspase-9 to the p35 subunit and activation of caspase-3. Caspase-9(Y153F) also attenuated DNA damage-induced processing of caspase-9 to p35, activation of caspase-3, and apoptosis.

Caspase-9 is the initiator caspase of the apoptosome, an oligomeric complex that controls the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Formation of the apoptosome is induced by release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol. Cytochrome c associates with Apaf-1 and thereby promotes its oligomerization and recruitment of caspase-9 (1Adrain C. Slee E. Harte M. Martin S. J. Biol.

Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with anti-c-Abl demonstrated little if any signal (Fig. 1A). By contrast, complexes of c-Abl and caspase-9 were detectable when similar experiments were performed on U-937 cells treated with araC, an inhibitor of DNA replication (39Major P.P. Egan E.M.

Immunoblot analysis of the adsorbates showed binding of c-Abl to GST-caspase-9 and not GST (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the interaction is direct, purified His-tagged caspase-9 was incubated with GST fusion proteins containing kinase-active GST-c-Abl or kinase-inactive GST-c-Abl(K-R). Immunoblotting of the adsorbates with anti-caspase-9 demonstrated binding to both c-Abl and c-Abl(K-R) (Fig. 1C). To further define the c-Abl sequences responsible for binding to caspase-9, we incubated Hiscaspase-9 with GST or a GST fusion protein that contains the c-Abl SH3 domain (GST-c-Abl SH3). The results show that c-Abl SH3 binds to His-caspase-9 (Fig. 1D). These findings indicate that c-Abl associates with caspase-9 in the response to genotoxic stress and that the interaction is mediated by direct binding through the c-Abl SH3 domain. c-Abl Phosphorylates Caspase-9 on Tyr-153—To determine whether caspase-9 functions as a c-Abl substrate, we incubated His-caspase-9 with purified GST-c-Abl or GST-c-Abl(K-R) and [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the products by SDS-PAGE and auto-radiography showed that caspase-9 is phosphorylated by c-Abl and not c-Abl(K-R) (Fig. 2A, left). To define the phosphorylation site, individual tyrosines in His-caspase-9 were mutated to phenylalanine (Tyr → Phe), and the mutants were analyzed as substrates for c-Abl. The results demonstrated that, in contrast to other mutants (Y251F, Y345F, Y363F, Y397F), there was no detectable phosphorylation of His-caspase-9 with the Y153F mutation (Fig. 2A, right). To determine whether c-Abl phosphorylates caspase-9 in vivo, studies were performed with wild-type and c-abl–/– mouse fibroblasts. Constitutive and araC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caspase-9 was detectable in wild-type, but not c-abl–/–, cells (Fig. 2B). Importantly, expression of c-Abl in the c-abl–/– cells (c-abl+/–) was also associated with constitutive and araC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caspase-9 (Fig. 2B). To determine whether caspase-9 is phosphorylated on Tyr-153 in cells, we generated U-937 cells stably expressing an empty vector or caspase-9(Y153F) (Fig. 2C, left). U-937 cells transfected with wild-type caspase-9 were not viable. As found for endogenous caspase-9, araC treatment was associated with coprecipitation of c-Abl and caspase-9(Y153F) (Fig. 2C, right). In addition, immunoblot analysis of anti-caspase-9 immunoprecipitates with anti-phospho-Tyr demonstrated araC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caspase-9 in the U-937/vector cells (Fig. 2D, left). By contrast, there was little detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of caspase-9 in the araC-treated U-937/caspase-9(Y153F) cells (Fig. 2D, right). These findings indicate that c-Abl phosphorylates caspase-9 on Tyr-153 in vitro and in the response of cells to DNA damage. Caspase-9(Y153F) or STI571 Treatment Attenuates DNA Damage-induced Autoprocessing of Caspase-9—Treatment of U-937 cells with araC is associated with release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol and activation of caspase-3 at 4 and 6 h (34Raina D. Mishra N. Kumar S. Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Kufe D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). araC treatment of U-937/vector cells was also associated with processing of caspase-9 to the p37 and p35 subunits (Fig. 3A). Importantly, however, processing of caspase-9 to the p35 fragment was attenuated in the araC-treated U-937/caspase-9(Y153F) cells (Fig. 3A). Moreover, araC-induced activation of caspase-3 was attenuated in U-937/caspase-9(Y153F) cells compared with that in U-937/vector cells (Fig. 3B). Caspase-3 induces cleavage of caspase-9 to the p37 subunit (4Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri T. Alnemri E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 9Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Thus, cleavage of caspase-9(Y153F) to p37 in the absence of caspase-3 activation indicates that low levels of caspase-3 activity or other proteases, perhaps even caspase-9 itself, may induce cleavage at Asp-330 in the presence of the Y153F mutation. To determine whether inhibition of c-Abl activity has similar effects on caspase-9 and caspase-3, U-937 cells were treated with the c-Abl inhibitor, STI571. Exposure to STI571 had no apparent effect on araC-induced release of cytochrome c (Fig. 3C). However, STI571 treatment was associated with attenuation of araC-induced cleavage of caspase-9 to the p35 subunit (Fig. 3C). STI571 also attenuated araC-induced activation of caspase-3 (data not shown). Consistent with these results, analysis of anti-caspase-9 immunoprecipitates from cytosolic fractions of U-937 cells demonstrated that araC increases the formation of c-Abl-caspase-9 complexes and that STI571 attenuates this response (Fig. 3D). Moreover, STI571 attenuated the araC-induced cleavage of caspase-9 to p35 (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that, like expression of caspase-9(Y153F), inhibition of the c-Abl kinase with STI571 attenuates araC-induced autoprocessing of caspase-9 to the p35 subunit. Caspase-9(Y153F) Attenuates DNA Damage-induced Apoptosis—The effects of the caspase-9(Y153F) mutant on araC-induced apoptosis were first assessed by monitoring the percentage of cells with sub-G1 DNA. araC treatment of U-937/vector cells was associated with a substantial increase in sub-G1 DNA content, and this response was attenuated in U-937/caspase-9(Y153F) cells (supplemental Fig. S1A). Similar results were obtained at different times of araC exposure and in repetitive experiments (Fig. 4A). U-937 cells also respond to 20 grays of ionizing radiation (IR) with the induction of apoptosis (40Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y. Campbell A. Thangrila S. Yuan Z. Narula J. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). As found with araC, IR-induced apoptosis of U-937/caspase-9(Y153F) cells was decreased compared with that obtained with U-937/vector cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). Confirmation of these results in additional experiments (Fig. 4B) indicated that U-937/caspase-9(Y153F) cells exhibit an attenuated apoptotic response to diverse DNA damaging agents. As an additional assay for apoptotic cells, araC-induced DNA laddering was attenuated in U-937 cells expressing caspase-9(Y153F) (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained with IR-treated U-937/vector and U-937/caspase-9(Y153F) cells (Fig. 4C). These findings indicate that caspase-9(Y153F) attenuates DNA damage-induced apoptosis. c-Abl Phosphorylates Caspase-9 on Tyr-153—Previous studies have demonstrated that Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylate and thereby inactivate caspase-9 processing (15Cardone M. Roy N. Stennicke H. Salvesen G. Franke T. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar, 16Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The present work demonstrates that c-Abl associates with caspase-9 in the response of cells to genotoxic stress. Low levels of constitutive binding of c-Abl and caspase-9 were also observed when cells were stressed by being overgrown (data not shown). In vitro studies further demonstrated that the c-Abl SH3 domain binds directly to caspase-9. The available evidence indicates that the c-Abl SH3 domain interacts with a proline-rich motif in the caspase-9 caspase recruitment domain region (PEVLRPETP; amino acids 118–126) (data not shown). The results also demonstrate that c-Abl phosphorylates caspase-9 on Tyr-153. The Tyr-153 site resides in the caspase-9 large subunit near the caspase recruitment domain region. Based on structural studies, Tyr-153 would be exposed on the inactive caspase-9 conformation and possibly buried in the active conformation near the dimer interface (7Renatus M. Stennicke H.R. Scott F.L. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Consistent with these predictions, caspase-9 and not caspase-9(Y153F) was subject to tyrosine phosphorylation in the response to DNA damage. DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of caspase-9 by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism was confirmed by the absence of this response in cells null for c-Abl expression. Moreover, expression of c-Abl in c-abl+/– cells was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of caspase-9. These findings indicate that caspase-9 is phosphorylated by c-Abl on Tyr-153 in vitro and in the cellular response to DNA damage. c-Abl Regulates Caspase-9 Autoprocessing in the Apoptotic Response to DNA Damage—c-Abl is activated in the response of cells to genotoxic stress (17Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Other studies on wild-type, c-abl–/–, and c-abl+/– cells have shown that c-Abl is essential for DNA damage-induced apoptosis (23Yuan Z. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc.

Wang H.-G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3292-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); however, there has been no known interaction between c-Abl and the initiator or effector caspases. In the present studies, the functional significance of the c-Abl-caspase-9 interaction in cells is supported by the demonstration that inhibition of c-Abl with STI571 blocks autoprocessing of caspase-9 to the p35 subunit. Caspase-9(Y153F) also blocked processing to the p35 subunit and caspase-3 activation. Our results further demonstrate that caspase-9(Y153F) blocks araC-induced apoptosis. araC misincorporates into DNA and functions as an inhibitor of DNA replication (39Major P.P. Egan E.M. Beardsley G. Minden M. Kufe D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3235-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The demonstration that caspase-9(Y153F) similarly attenuates IR-induced apoptosis indicates that the c-Abl → caspase-9 pathway is of importance in the response to other genotoxic agents. Of potential significance, caspase-9 Tyr-153 is conserved in sites that are proximal to L1 loops in other caspases, including caspase-3 (Tyr-37) and caspase-7 (Tyr-60). The present findings thus support a model in which caspase-9 autocleavage is regulated by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism in the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress.

The apical caspase DRONC is known to be transcriptionally regulated by ecdysone during development. Here we demonstrate that ecdysone also regulates the transcription of DRICE, a major effector caspase and a downstream target for DRONC in the fly. Using RNA interference in an ecdysone-responsive Drosophila cell line, we show that drice up-regulation is essential for apoptosis induced by ecdysone. We also show that drice expression is specifically controlled by the ecdysone-regulated transcription factor BR-C. Combined with previous observations, our results indicate that transcriptional regulation of the components of the core apoptotic machinery plays a key role in hormone-regulated programmed cell death during Drosophila development.

Combined with previous observations, our results indicate that transcriptional regulation of the components of the core apoptotic machinery plays a key role in hormone-regulated programmed cell death during Drosophila development. Programmed cell death is necessary to delete superfluous cells in metazoans and to maintain homeostasis (reviewed in Refs. 1Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar and 2Zakeri Z. Lockshin R.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 265: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The core cell death machinery, consisting of the BH3-only proteins, BCL-2 family, caspase adaptors, and caspases, is highly conserved and is present in all metazoan cells (reviewed in Refs. 3Adams J.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2481-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 4Kumar S. Cakouros D. Trends Biochem.

As most components of the cell death machinery are present constitutively within a cell, it is widely believed that execution of apoptosis is primarily regulated post-transcriptionally, that is apoptotic signals somehow feed into and activate preexisting caspase machinery. However, recent data suggest that many components of the core apoptosis machinery, including some caspases, are transcriptionally regulated during cell death and that the levels of the prosurvival and proapoptotic factors in the cell may be crucial to activate the apoptotic program (reviewed in Ref. 4Kumar S. Cakouros D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 193-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, there is evidence that various signals such as cytotoxic insults, hormones, and growth factors regulate the activation of the death program by controlling the balance between prosurvival and proapoptotic proteins of the core cell death machinery (4Kumar S. Cakouros D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 193-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To understand cell death regulation, it is thus essential to understand the transcriptional control of apoptosis execution. Steroid hormones are known to regulate cell survival and cell death in many tissues. Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model system to study steroid hormone-regulated apoptosis as a single steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, regulates cell death during development (reviewed in Refs. 5Baehrecke E.H.

Ecdysone binds to its heterodimeric EcR/Usp receptor and transcriptionally regulates a number of primary response genes. Waves of ecdysone, produced at various times during fly development, regulate molting, cell proliferation, differentiation, and death in a highly controlled manner (5Baehrecke E.H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

During the transition of larva into pupa, an ecdysone pulse toward the end of the third larval instar stage signals puparium formation, followed by a second pulse ∼12 h later, which initiates head eversion. During this process obsolete larval tissues, such as salivary glands and midgut, are deleted and replaced by adult tissues (5Baehrecke E.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Cell death in the larval midgut begins in response to the late larval pulse of ecdysone while the salivary glands undergo removal around 15 h later in response to the second hormone pulse (5Baehrecke E.H.

Studies, mostly with salivary glands, indicate that ecdysone controls the up-regulation of a number of proapoptotic genes such as rpr, hid, dark and dronc, and down-regulates the expression of death inhibitors such as diap1 and diap2 (14Jiang C.

Among the seven Drosophila caspases (17Kumar S. Doumanis J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), ecdysone is well known to regulate dronc expression (18Dorstyn L. Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). DRONC is a CED3/caspase-9-like apical caspase that is essential for several programmed cell death pathways in the fly (17Kumar S. Doumanis J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Dorstyn L. Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our previous data with DRONC suggest that ecdysone-mediated up-regulation of dronc is an important regulator of hormone-dependent cell death in Drosophila cells (19Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One of the downstream targets of DRONC is the effector caspase DRICE (17Kumar S. Doumanis J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As DRICE is the major caspase-3-like effector enzyme in Drosophila, we tested whether it is also regulated by ecdysone. We report here that drice up-regulation by ecdysone plays an important role in hormone-dependent cell death.

Apoptosis Detection—To assess apoptosis, cells were stained with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluorescent dye. Briefly, cells were fixed and stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI, 20% formaldehyde, and mounted 1:1 with 80% glycerol. Changes in nuclear morphology were observed by fluorescent microscopy and apoptosis (%) was calculated as the proportion of cells with condensed chromatin in a total count of at least 300 cells. Data were derived from three or four experiments. Caspase Assays—Cell lysates were prepared by freeze thawing and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of lysate were assayed for caspase activity using 100 μm VDVAD-amc and DEVD-amc substrates as described previously (23Dorstyn L. Mills K. Lazebnik Y. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the release of amc was measured using a fluorometric plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (excitation 385 nm, emission 460 nm). RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from l(2)mbn cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's protocol. 1-5 μg of total RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis, in a 20-μl reaction with 500 ng of oligo(dT)18, using a Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's protocol. Using 1.5 μl of 1:3 diluted cDNA template, PCR amplification was performed using appropriate primers in a 50-μl reaction employing 27-33 cycles. Drosophila rp49 was used as a control. Aliquots of PCR products (20 μl) were electrophoresed on 1.5-2% agarose gel for analysis. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and blocked for 1 h in 5% skim milk (pH 7.5). Affinity-purified anti-DRONC (24Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:300 dilution, and DRICE antibody (24Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:500 dilution. Secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used at 1:2000 dilution. Signals were detected using ECF system (Amersham Biosciences). A cytochrome c antibody was purchased from Pharmingen and used at a 1:2000 dilution as described (23Dorstyn L. Mills K. Lazebnik Y. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). RNAi—Regions of cDNA for drice (nucleotides 451-968), dcp-1 (nucleotides 921-1303), dronc (nucleotides 781-1047), E74A (nucleotides 2929-3248), E74B (nucleotides 1367-1724), E75A (nucleotides 706-1060), E75B (nucleotides 893-1240), E93 (nucleotides 397-862), βFTZ-F1 (nucleotides 39-530), and BR-C (nucleotides 392-1060) were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Plasmids were linearized, and RNA was synthesized using T7 and SP6 Megascript kits (Ambion). Sense and antisense strands were annealed to generate dsRNA, and the quality of RNA was analyzed on a 2.2 m formaldehyde gel. dsRNA (∼40 nm) was added to cells in 1 ml of serum-free medium and mixed vigorously as described previously (23Dorstyn L. Mills K. Lazebnik Y. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J.

Cells were incubated for 1 h followed by the addition of 2 ml of medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated at 27 °C for 3 days and then harvested for 0-h time points or treated with ecdysone for the required length of time. drice Is Up-regulated in Salivary Glands Treated with Ecdysone—It has previously been shown that ecdysone treatment of late second instar larvae salivary glands results in the up-regulation of dronc mRNA (18Dorstyn L. Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Because the effector caspases are necessary for salivary gland death to occur (5Baehrecke E.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 8Baehrecke E.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) we investigated whether the major downstream effector caspase DRICE was also regulated by ecdysone. To determine whether drice mRNA expression is induced by ecdysone, dissected salivary glands from staged late third instar larvae were treated with ecdysone. After a 1-h ecdysone treatment a dramatic increase in drice mRNA levels was observed, demonstrating that ecdysone can induce drice expression in larval salivary glands (Fig. 1A). Caspase assays performed with lysates from ecdysone-treated salivary glands showed elevated caspase activity (Fig. 1B). In particular we observed a 4.5-fold increase in activity on DEVD-amc, which is a substrate for DRICE. Consistent with this observation, DRICE protein levels were elevated in extracts from ecdysone-treated salivary glands (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest the involvement of DRICE in ecdysone-regulated salivary gland death and more importantly demonstrate that drice mRNA is up-regulated by ecdysone. drice Is Induced by Ecdysone in l(2)mbn Cells—To further investigate the ecdysone-induction of drice transcription and dissect out its transcriptional regulation by various transcription factors we used the ecdysone-responsive Drosophila cell line l(2)mbn. We first analyzed ecdysone-mediated apoptosis by DAPI staining. As shown in Fig. 2A, apoptotic cells were identified by nuclear fragmentation. In the representative experiment shown in Fig. 2B, low levels of apoptosis were observed at 12- and 24-h post ecdysone treatment. From 36 h the number of cells undergoing apoptosis increased significantly, and by 48 h 70% of cells display condensed nuclei. Northern blot analysis indicated that l(2)mbn cells have low levels of drice transcript. Up-regulation of the drice transcript was evident 6 h after treatment and continued to increase with treatment time, being greatest at 48 h (Fig. 2C). Caspase activity on DEVD-amc and VDVAD-amc substrates was observed from 24 and 12 h, respectively, and subsequently increased with time (Fig. 2D). In addition, increased DRICE processing is observed around 36 h, and the accumulation of processed DRONC is evident at 12 h (Fig. 2E). The results with l(2)mbn cells confirm that drice is transcriptionally regulated by ecdysone treatment. In addition, our observations suggest that following ecdysone treatment of l(2)mbn cells, the increase in drice transcript levels correlates with increased DRICE and its processed form, DEVD-specific caspase activity, and apoptosis. DRICE Is Essential for Execution of Apoptosis in l(2)mbn Cells following Ecdysone Treatment—We next wanted to determine the importance of DRICE in ecdysone-induced apoptosis of l(2)mbn cells. To do this we used RNAi to ablate gene function. Because DCP-1 is also an important effector caspase in Drosophila it was of interest to test whether there was compensation between the two key effector caspases, DRICE and DCP-1. We also tested whether knockdown of both drice and dcp-1 could prevent apoptosis of l(2)mbn cells following ecdysone treatment. As a comparison we silenced the expression of the initiator caspase DRONC, shown previously to be important in ecdysone-induced l(2)mbn death (19Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The knockdown of drice, dcp-1, both drice and dcp-1, or dronc by RNAi was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis using total RNA prepared from ecdysone-treated cells (Fig. 3A). At a time when ∼50% of control cells were undergoing apoptosis we were unable to detect significant levels of apoptosis in drice dsRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3B). The rate of ecdysone-induced apoptosis in dcp-1 knockdown cells was reduced to ∼50% of controls (Fig. 3B) and was reduced to ∼30% of controls in dronc knockdown cells (Fig. 3B). These results show that DRICE, DCP-1, and DRONC are all required for ecdysone to efficiently induce l(2)mbn apoptosis; however, ablation of drice had the most profound effect on ecdysone-mediated programmed cell death. DRICE Is Necessary for Maximal Ecdysone-induced Caspase Activity—Because DRICE function is essential for the efficient execution of apoptosis in ecdysone-treated l(2)mbn cells we wanted to establish its contribution to caspase activity. Caspase assays were performed with lysates using DEVD-amc and VDVAD-amc substrates (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). In the absence of DRICE, lysates displayed basal levels of DEVDase activity. Ablation of dcp-1 resulted in ∼25% activity of controls. When both drice and dcp-1 were silenced DEVDase activity was virtually abolished (Fig. 4A). Previous studies have established that DCP-1 is a substrate for DRICE (26Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6192-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and that DEVD-amc is a substrate for both DRICE and DCP-1. Because drice knockdown completely abolished DEVDase activity, whereas dcp-1 RNAi lysates still display DEVDase activity, these findings imply a necessity for DRICE in DCP-1 activation. Ablating dronc results in DEVDase activity that is ∼60% of controls (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with DRONC being an upstream activator of the effector caspases. When caspase assays were performed using a VDVAD-amc substrate, caspase activity following ecdysone treatment of drice or dcp-1 knockdown cells was only ∼20% of controls (Fig. 4B). Silencing both drice and dcp-1 resulted in basal VDVADase activity (Fig. 4B). In the absence of dronc expression ∼60% of control VDVADase activity was observed (Fig. 4B). Because VDVADase activity in part represents DRONC activity, these data suggest that DRICE and DCP-1 may affect DRONC activity. In addition, because activity on both DEVD-amc and VDVAD-amc substrates is still present in dronc knockdown cells, these data present evidence that DRICE activation may occur by means other than DRONC-mediated activation in l(2)mbn cells. Evidence for a Caspase Activation Loop in l(2)mbn Cells—To further characterize the effect of ablating drice gene function we analyzed protein expression and processing of DRICE and DRONC. In ecdysone-treated control cells we observe up-regulation of DRICE precursor and accumulation of its processed form (Fig. 4C, DRICE proc.). The ablation of either dcp-1 or dronc did not affect DRICE precursor levels; however, we see a reduced processing of DRICE. dronc RNAi had a more profound affect on DRICE processing than dcp-1 RNAi, thus both DRONC and DCP-1 may be capable of activating DRICE. As discussed previously, ecdysone treatment of l(2)mbn cells leads to an accumulation of processed DRONC (Fig. 4C, control lanes). We observe substantially reduced processed DRONC in the absence of DRICE (Fig. 4C). dcp-1 RNAi did not have any significant affect on processed DRONC levels. Because processed DRONC levels are significantly lower in drice-ablated ecdysone-treated cells, we propose that DRICE is required for amplification of DRONC processing following the initial activation of the upstream caspase. Ecdysone-induced Factors E74A, E74B, E75A, E75B, E93, or βFTZ-F1 Are Not Required for drice Up-regulation—Because we established drice up-regulation and the importance of DRICE in ecdysone-mediated apoptosis in l(2)mbn cells, we could now use this system to investigate the role of known ecdysone-induced transcription factors in drice transcription. We therefore carried out the RNAi ablation of several ecdysone-responsive transcription factors in l(2)mbn cells. The transcription factors E74A, E74B, E75A, E75B, E93, βFTZ-F1, and BR-C have been identified as important regulators of ecdysone-mediated salivary gland death (14Jiang C. Lamblin A.F. Steller H. Thummel C.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15Lee C. Cooksey B. Baehrecke E. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Lee C.Y. Baehrecke E.H. Development. 2001; 128: 1443-1455PubMed Google Scholar, 28Martin D.N. Baehrecke E.H. Development. 2004; 131: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5A we show the effect of ablating E74A, E74B, E75A, or E75B on ecdysone-induced l(2)mbn apoptosis. Compared with controls, induction of apoptosis by ecdysone treatment was not significantly affected by silencing any of these transcription factors. When we silence E93, ecdysone-induced apoptosis was reduced by 35% compared with controls (Fig. 5B). βFTZ-F1 RNAi did not affect apoptosis induction (Fig. 5B). Thus, of the transcription factors studied, only E93 was identified as being important for regulation of ecdysone-mediated apoptosis in l(2)mbn cells. We then analyzed drice transcription by RT-PCR. The ability of ecdysone to induce drice up-regulation was not affected by silencing E74A, E74B, E75A, E75B, E93, or βFTZ-F1 (Fig. 5, C and D). Because E93 RNAi did not affect drice transcription, the rate of apoptosis in E93 knockdown cells is likely to be reduced as a result of reduced dronc expression, which has been previously reported (15Lee C. Cooksey B. Baehrecke E. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). DEVDase Activity Is Not Directly Affected by the Ecdysone-responsive Transcription Factors E74A, E74B, E75A, E75B, E93, or βFTZ-F1—Although drice transcription was not regulated by the ecdysone-responsive transcription factors E74A, E74B, E75A, E75B, E93, or βFTZ-F1, it was of interest to establish whether there was any effect on caspase activity. Analysis of DEVDase activity shows that E74A, E74B, E75A, or E75B RNAi-treated cells achieve similar levels of DEVDase activity as controls (Fig. 6A). E93 RNAi resulted in DEVDase activity that was ∼50% of control activity (Fig. 6B). Silencing βFTZ-F1 had no significant effect on DEVDase activity (Fig. 6B). E74A, E74B, E75A, E75B, or βFTZ-F1 ablation had no significant effect on VDVADase activity in l(2)mbn cells, whereas E93 RNAi showed significantly reduced levels of activity (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus ablation of E93, but not E74A, E74B, E75A, E75B, or βFTZ-F1, leads to reduced caspase activity in ecdysone-treated l(2)mbn cells consistent with the effects we see on apoptosis induction. In the absence of E74A, E74B, E75A, E75B, or βFTZ-F1, DRICE processing following ecdysone-induction of DRICE was relatively unchanged compared with controls (Fig. 6E). Although we see less processed DRICE in E93 RNAi lysates, induction of DRICE precursor is not significantly affected (Fig. 6E). Thus none of the transcription factors E74A, E74B, E75A, E75B, E93, or βFTZ-F1 regulate ecdysone-induced drice transcription or expression of this effector caspase. BR-C Regulates Ecdysone-induced drice Transcription—The ecdysone-induced transcription factor BR-C plays a key role in salivary gland death and is a regulator of dronc transcription (14Jiang C. Lamblin A.F. Steller H. Thummel C.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 19Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). There are four isoforms of BR-C protein, Z1-Z4 (29DiBello P.R. Withers D.A. Bayer C.A. Fristrom J.W. Guild G.M. Genetics. 1991; 129: 385-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Z2 isoform is constitutively present in l(2)mbn cells, and following ecdysone treatment the Z1, Z3, and Z4 isoforms are expressed (19Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test whether BR-C regulates ecdysone-induced drice transcription we carried out RNAi ablation of BR-C in l(2)mbn cells. BR-C RNAi significantly inhibited the rate of ecdysone-mediated apoptosis indicating that BR-C is an important regulator of ecdysone-induced apoptosis in l(2)mbn cells (Fig. 7A). Analysis of transcription by RT-PCR using total RNA shows that BR-C RNAi reduces ecdysone-induced transcription of drice (Fig. 7B). Activity on both DEVD-amc and VDVAD-amc substrates was reduced to ∼30% of control activity in l(2)mbn cells treated with BR-C dsRNA (Fig. 7, C and D) correlating with the effects seen on apoptosis induction. Immunoblot analysis indicated that processing of both DRICE and DRONC was markedly reduced upon knockdown of BR-C (Fig. 7E). Additionally, ecdysone-induction of full-length DRICE and DRONC was significantly reduced (Fig. 7E). Our results therefore demonstrate that BR-C is required for ecdysone-mediated regulation of drice transcription. The data presented here demonstrate that drice expression is up-regulated in response to ecdysone in both larval salivary glands and Drosophila l(2)mbn cells. The observations are consistent with a large scale gene expression analysis during salivary gland cell death, which shows that drice, among many other genes, is up-regulated in dying salivary glands (30Lee C.Y. Clough E.A. Yellon P. Teslovich T.M. Stephan D.A. Baehrecke E.H. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 350-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When drice expression was ablated by RNAi, we observed low levels of caspase activity and a dramatic reduction in the rate of apoptosis following ecdysone treatment. In addition, our data suggest that DRICE is required for DRONC processing in ecdysone-treated l(2)mbn cells. Recent studies have shown that effector caspase activation in some tissues may occur in the absence of DRONC (13Daish T.J. Mills K. Kumar S. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 909-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Dorstyn L. Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Data in this paper complement these findings and supports the observation that some DRICE activation may occur in the absence of DRONC. Expression of the cell death genes rpr, hid, crq, dark, and dronc in salivary glands and midgut has been shown to be regulated by ecdysone-responsive transcription factors BR-C and E93 (14Jiang C. Lamblin A.F. Steller H. Thummel C.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15Lee C. Cooksey B. Baehrecke E. Dev.

The knockdown of BR-C in l(2)mbn cells reduced ecdysone-induced drice transcription and resulted in reduced DRICE expression, thus demonstrating that BR-C regulates drice transcription in l(2)mbn cells. E93 knockdown did not affect drice regulation following ecdysone treatment of l(2)mbn cells. As E93 regulates dronc expression (15Lee C. Cooksey B. Baehrecke E. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Daish T.J. Cakouros D. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1348-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Lee C.Y.

Cell. 2000; 6: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the decrease in apoptosis levels that we observed is likely to be a result of reduced dronc transcription and protein expression. Although BR-C and E93 are required in both salivary gland and midgut apoptosis, their functions differ between the tissues. For example, dronc expression is regulated in salivary glands by both BR-C and E93 but only by E93 in the midgut (15Lee C. Cooksey B. Baehrecke E. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Broadus J. McCabe J.R. Endrizzi B. Thummel C.S. Woodard C.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 143-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to test whether like dronc, BR-C regulation of drice is tissue-specific. The competence factor βFTZ-F1 is needed for the precise developmental re-expression of transcription factors including BR-C and E93 (32Lee C.Y. Simon C.R. Woodard C.T. Baehrecke E.H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 252: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We investigated its involvement in ecdysone-induced l(2)mbn apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate no clear role for βFTZ-F1 in regulating the apoptosis of l(2)mbn cells. We speculate that in l(2)mbn cells, βFTZ-F1 is not required, because l(2)mbn cells do not undergo developmental transitions. Studies in this paper suggest that ecdysone-regulated DRICE is an essential effector of apoptosis execution in l(2)mbn cells. Based on the data presented here, we propose a model for DRICE-mediated amplification of the caspase cascade in ecdysone-treated cells (Fig. 8). Given that drice mutants are currently unavailable, specific ablation of this caspase in salivary glands and midgut may be required to further investigate the role of DRICE in ecdysone-induced programmed cell death in vivo. We thank Tasman Daish for technical help and Augustus Dorn for l(2)mbn cells."
https://openalex.org/W2086209077,"Mouse testican-2 was cloned, sequenced, and shown to be a proteoglycan with a multidomain structure closely similar to that of the human ortholog, previously described as a calcium binding extracellular matrix molecule of the BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin family (Vannahme, C., Schubel, S., Herud, M., Gosling, S., Hulsmann, H., Paulsson, M., Hartmann, U., and Maurer, P. (1999). J. Neurochem. 73, 12–20). Recombinant mouse testican-2 was used to prepare specific antibodies that allowed the detection of testican-2 in various brain structures but also in lung, testis, and in several endocrine glands. Although the testican-2 expressed in EBNA-293 cells carried both heparan sulfate and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, the tissue form always contained only heparan sulfate. Both tissue-derived and recombinant testican-2 carried N-linked glycans. Tissue-derived forms of testican-2 were detected as proteoglycans of varying size, whereas a portion of the molecules produced by EBNA-293 cells were core proteins, lacking glycosaminoglycans. Both the proteoglycan and core protein forms of testican-2 inhibited neurite extension from cultured primary cerebellar neurons and may play regulatory roles in the development of the central nervous system."

Chem. 1993; 268: 11326-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the ADK null phenotype reveals a compensating metabolic plasticity. S. cerevisiae survives because the broad substrate specificity of its uridylate kinase (Ura6p) compensates for the deficiency in cytoplasmic ADK activity (4Schricker R. Magdolen V. Kaniak A. Wolf K. Bandlow W. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, a small proportion of the yeast ADK (Aky2p) is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (5Strobel G. Zollner A. Angermayr M. Bandlow W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), where it may contribute to efficient translocation of ATP from the mitochondrial matrix into the cytoplasm (1Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 2039-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Uridylate kinase is not present in yeast mitochondria, and hence AKY2-deficient S. cerevisiae exhibit a petite phenotype and are unable to grow under nonfermentative conditions (6Bandlow W. Strobel G. Zoglowek C. Oechsner U. Magdolen V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle of transgenic AK1-/- knock-out mice, metabolic reprogramming and ultrastructural reorganization have been observed (7Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Oerlemans F. Simonetti A.W.

Here, glycolytic flux, creatine kinase activity, and mitochondrial volume are increased to support muscle function, albeit with reduced energy economy and efficiency under stress (7Janssen E.

The focus of this study is the uniflagellate protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causal agent of human African sleeping sickness (see, on the World Wide Web, www.who.int/tdr/diseases/tryp/). There are many interesting and unusual aspects to trypanosome metabolism (10Hannaert V. Bringaud F. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Kinetoplastid Biol. Dis. 2003; 2: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A single aerobically functioning mitochondrion and microbodies of the peroxisome class are present. However, in the mammalian host, the mitochondrial energy metabolism of the parasite is largely repressed; neither cytochromes nor tricarboxylic acid cycle are present. Glycolysis is the sole energy-generating pathway, and pyruvate is excreted as the major end product of this glucose catabolism. Uniquely, the first seven glycolytic enzymes occur solely in peroxisomes. Peroxisomal targeting of glycolytic enzymes and certain other enzymes utilized for carbohydrate metabolism (10Hannaert V. Bringaud F. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Kinetoplastid Biol. Dis. 2003; 2: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) is characteristic of all trypanosomatids and reflects the description of these trypanosomatid microbodies as glycosomes (10Hannaert V.

Rev. 2004; 28: 603-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). T. brucei is transmitted between mammalian hosts by its insect vector (Glossina sp., tsetse fly). Procyclic trypanosomes (found in the tsetse fly midgut) have an aerobic metabolism and use a variety of carbon sources (12Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A.

Fast B. Vogt A. van der Meer P. Saas J. van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol.

Although oxidative phosphorylation is an important facet of procyclic metabolism, pyruvate kinase and an acetate:succinate CoA-transferase/succinyl-CoA synthetase cycle catalyze important substrate phosphorylations. The cytoplasmic phosphotransfer reaction catalyzed by the former enzyme appears to be essential, except perhaps under conditions where increased substrate availability can result in increased mitochondrial amino acid (proline) metabolism (12Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A. Canioni P. Baltz T. Bringaud F. J. Biol.

Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Acetate:succinate CoA transferase is restricted in its evolutionary distribution to trypanosomatid mitochondria, anaerobic helminth mitochondria, and protist hydrogenosomes; it catalyzes formation of acetate from acetyl-CoA. This reaction, rather than entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is the predominant pathway used for acetyl-CoA metabolism; acetate is excreted from the cell as a major end product of metabolism, and the succinyl-CoA product is recycled by mitochondrial succinyl-CoA synthetase, generating ATP (15Bochud-Allemann N. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32849-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Deletion of acetate:succinate CoA-transferase initially results in a severe growth defect, before compensatory metabolic rearrangements allow cells to adapt to loss of the enzyme (17Riviere L. Van Weelden S.W. Glass P. Vegh P. Coustou V. Biran M. Van Hellemond J.J. Bringaud F. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45337-45346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here, we report that the complex stage-regulated metabolism of T. brucei is buttressed by the expression of seven ADK-like genes. The expression of seven ADKs within the context of a single cell has not been reported previously, but in this protozoan parasite it reflects the requirement to target ADK into glycosomes and two distinct flagellar structures as well as more classical intracellular sites such as cytoplasm and mitochondrion. Molecular interrogation of the ADK gene family, while demonstrating metabolic adaptation, also indicates that there is likely to be considerable complexity within the relationship between phosphotransfer activity and homeostasis of cellular energetics. Reagents—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Cells—Procyclic T. brucei, stock 427, was maintained at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum as described previously (18Brun R. Schonenberger Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). RNA interference (RNAi) experiments were conducted using the procyclic 29-13 cell line, which has been genetically modified in order to express the tetracycline repressor protein and bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (19Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Stable integration of exogenous DNA into procyclic cells was carried out as described previously (20Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). RNAi cell lines were maintained in the presence of the selectable agents hygromycin (50 μg/ml), G-418 (15 μg/ml), and phleomycin (3 μg/ml) until 48 h prior to the start of an experiment. Extracts from long slender and short stumpy bloodstream trypanosomes were prepared and analyzed using antibody markers as described previously (21Breidbach T. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Steverding D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cell counts were determined using either a Neubauer heamocytometer (Sigma), or a CASY1 cell counter (Schärfe System). Recombinant DNA Procedures—Genomic DNA was extracted as described previously (22Bernards A. Van der Ploeg L.H. Frasch A.C. Borst P. Boothroyd J.C. Coleman S. Cross G.A. Cell. 1981; 27: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). RNA was obtained using a High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science). Northern and Southern blotting was carried out according to standard protocols (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar); blots were washed to high stringency (0.1× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% (w/v) SDS; 65 °C). Fluorescein-labeled DNA probes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with CDP-star (Amersham Biosciences). For two-step reverse transcription-PCR, cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT)15 primer and Omniscript (Qiagen). Incorporation of SyberGreen (Applied Biosystems) into relevant amplicons was determined using an ABI Prism 7700 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and the following thermal cycling parameters: 95 °C, 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C, 15 s; 60 °C, 1 min. PCR products were analyzed on gels to confirm the absence of nonspecific amplification. Controls without reverse transcription and amplification using single primers only were also carried out. DNA sequencing was performed using ABI-Prism automated sequencing with custom-designed primers. Plasmid Construction—Detailed descriptions of how the plasmids used in this study were constructed are provided in the supplemental information. RNAi plasmids were based on the opposing promoter system pioneered by Englund and co-workers (20Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). For immunolocalization of ADKA, ADKB, and ADKE, each containing a single Ty1 epitope at their respective C termini, the plasmids pTAFADKA::Ty, pTAFADKB::Ty, and pTubADKE::Ty were constructed. For the expression of the GFP::ADKD fusion protein, pVsg4GFP::ADKD was constructed. This fusion protein was expressed under the control of an RNA polymerase I-transcribed EP1 promoter following stable integration of pVsg4GFP::ADKD into a minichromosomal locus. For expression of recombinant ADKG in E. coli, pTbAKGr was constructed. Generation of ADKC-/-Null Mutants—PCR amplification of hygromycin and bleomycin resistance markers was achieved using primer combinations ADKCko1 and ADKCko2 (template pGad8-tubulin (24Wickstead B. Ersfeld K. Gull K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3993-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)) or ADKCko3 and ADKCko4 (template pRM481 (25Conway C. Proudfoot C. Burton P. Barry J.D. McCulloch R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1687-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)), respectively (see Supplemental Table I for primer sequences). The 5′ region of each primer contained ∼50 bp of homology to the ADKC locus, facilitating gene disruption by homologous recombination; PCR products (3 μg) were used for transformation of procyclic 427 T. brucei. For second round transformation of hygromycin-resistant ADKC-/- heterozygotes, the bleomycin resistance marker was amplified from a first round heterozygote transformant using a primer combination of ADKCko5 and ADKCko6. The resulting PCR product was then used for stable transformation of procyclic cultures. Integration events into trypanosomes were analyzed by PCR and Southern mapping. Expression and Analysis of Recombinant ADKG—Following transformation of pTbAKGr into E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene), expression of recombinant TbADKG was induced by the addition of isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (60 μg/ml). Recombinant protein was purified by Ni2+ -nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The activity of the recombinant enzyme was measured as described previously by following the rate of NDP formation from NTP and NMP substrates in a coupled system that required pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (26Berghauser J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 397: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained Tris-HCl (0.1 m, pH 7.6), KCl (80 mm), MgCl2 (1.4 mm), phosphoenolpyruvate (400 μm), NADH (200 μm), pyruvate kinase (10 units/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (10 units/ml), NTP (0.8 mm), NMP (2.3 mm), and recombinant ADKG (68.8 μm). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as 1 μmol of NAD+ formed/min. Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescence—Polyclonal antiserum against recombinant ADKG was prepared by Eurogentech. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against T. brucei aldolase were used as described previously (27Lorenz P. Maier A.G. Baumgart E. Erdmann R. Clayton C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3542-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out according to standard methods (21Breidbach T. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Steverding D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence of formaldehyde- and methanol-fixed detergent-extracted cytoskeletons using BB2 and ROD-1 (28Woods A. Sherwin T. Sasse R. MacRae T.H. Baines A.J. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 491-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) monoclonal antibodies was performed as described previously (29Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 30Bastin P. Pullen T.J. Sherwin T. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3769-3777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seven ADK-like Genes Are Expressed in T. brucei—Using NMPK genes characterized from S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, Homo sapiens, E. coli, and Bacillus subtilis as query sequences, we analyzed the T. brucei genome data bases at Sanger and the Institute for Genome Research for the presence of NMPK genes. We found open reading frames homologous to the guanylate kinase and thymidylate kinase from S. cerevisiae and humans (31Jong A.Y. Kuo C.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11052-11059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Su J.Y. Sclafani R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25652-25655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no hits to cytidylate and uridylate kinase gene families that are unique to bacteria (34Bucurenci N. Sakamoto H. Briozzo P. Palibroda N. Serina L. Sarfati R.S. Labesse G. Briand G. Danchin A. Barzu O. Gilles A.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5066-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We also found a T. brucei homologue of a very recently discovered distinct class of ADK genes that is conserved in eukaryotes and Archaea; in S. cerevisiae and humans, this novel ADK family member is found in the nucleus (37Ren H. Wang L. Bennett M. Liang Y. Zheng X. Lu F. Li L. Nan J. Luo M. Eriksson S. Zhang C. Su X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, through a combination of data base searching and PCR cloning, we identified seven different sequences that shared homology with the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ADK genes from yeast and humans (Fig. 1). Now that the T. brucei genome project is nearing completion, all of the open reading frames that we identified can now be viewed at the Sanger Centre Web site (www.genedb.org/genedb/tryp/index.jsp). With the exception of the neighboring ADKC and ADKF, these genes are not clustered in the genome. We also demonstrated that each of the ADK genes was transcribed into mRNA using real time PCR to monitor the incorporation of SyberGreen into specific amplicons. This analysis revealed that each gene was expressed in both procyclic and long slender bloodstream trypanosomes. We hypothesized that the expression of seven different ADK genes in trypanosomes (more than has ever been observed previously in any other unicellular organism or individual cell type) reflects a molecular radiation to fill particular metabolic niches. Comparison of the trypanosome ADK family with homologues from other organisms indicated that T. brucei ADKC and ADKF possess no unusual or structurally distinctive characteristics. In this regard, they resemble the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ADK isoforms of other eukaryotes. By contrast, our attention was focused by unusual primary sequence characteristics in each of the remaining five T. brucei enzymes. The Short Form “Cryptic Kinase” Has Broad Substrate Specificity—TbADKG encodes the only trypanosome short form ADK; the distinction between long and short ADK isoforms referring to the length of the LID domain (38Fukami-Kobayashi K. Nosaka M. Nakazawa A. Go M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The LID contributes to the overall folding of NMPKs and changes conformation following the binding of substrate to the enzyme. In mammalian cells, the major cytoplasmic form of ADK is a short form enzyme, and mitochondrial activity is associated with longer ADK isoforms (38Fukami-Kobayashi K. Nosaka M. Nakazawa A. Go M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In yeast, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ADK activities are provided by long form ADK enzymes (3Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11326-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19468-19474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic UMP/CMP kinases share primary sequence homology with ADK and are always of the short kind (38Fukami-Kobayashi K. Nosaka M. Nakazawa A. Go M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Careful bioinformatic analysis places ADKG within the UMP/CMP class of NMPK, yet an Asp residue that is predicted to be very important in the discrimination between a CMP/UMP versus an AMP substrate in UMP/CMP kinase (40Scheffzek K. Kliche W. Wiesmuller L. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9716-9727Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) is substituted by a Gln residue (Gln100) in ADKG. This Gln residue is conserved in the other T. brucei ADKs and the previously characterized S. cerevisiae proteins Aky2p and Ura6p (Fig. 1), indicating that in ADKG at least one of the residues considered important for catalysis places ADKG with ATP:AMP phosphotransferases rather than UMP/CMP kinases. Ura6p, on the basis of its mutant phenotype, is a UMP/CMP kinase (41Liljelund P. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but the presence of Q111 may contribute to the broad specificity of this enzyme and activity with an AMP substrate (42Muller-Dieckmann H.J. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 43Muller-Dieckmann H.J. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the substrate specificity of the cryptic kinase, ADKG, in more detail. ADKG was expressed in E. coli as a recombinant protein with six His residues at its N terminus and purified using an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Following purification, a single protein band of ∼24 kDa was visible on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel, in close agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 23,793 Da for the recombinant protein (data not shown). The activity of recombinant ADKG with different substrates is shown in Table I. With regard to the phosphate acceptor, ADKG was able to transfer phosphate from ATP to CMP, AMP, and UMP but not to GMP or IMP. The enzyme showed a 30-fold greater substrate preference for CMP relative to UMP and exhibited substantial activity with AMP (44% of that seen for CMP). Using AMP as the acceptor substrate, ATP was found to be the preferred phosphate donor, although some activity was also seen for other NTP substrates (Table I). ADKG was also inhibited by diadenosine pentaphosphate (AP5A in Fig. 2), a transition state analogue that is a specific inhibitor of ADKs but not other NMPKs (44Feldhau P. Frohlich T. Goody R.S. Isakov M. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Km and Vmax values were also calculated (Table II). These indicated that CMP was a higher affinity substrate than AMP. On the other hand, Vmax values showed that the enzyme reached similar turnover rates with both AMP and CMP. However, maximum activity with CMP was reached at much lower substrate concentration than with AMP. Immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant enzyme indicated that a protein band of 24 kDa was present in cell lysates prepared from bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes (data not shown; gel loading 20 μg of total cell protein from each developmental stage). A lower amount of ADKG was found in the cell cycle-arrested bloodstream stumpy forms (19% of the level seen in long slender pleomorphic AnTat 1.1 bloodstream forms; 28% of the level seen in procyclic trypanosomes) that are preadapted for rapid differentiation into procyclic forms in the tsetse fly midgut, indicating some degree of stage-specific regulation. The homogeneity of such parasite populations was confirmed using antibodies against known stage-regulated proteins, as described previously (21Breidbach T. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Steverding D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Table ISubstrate specificity of T. brucei ADKGSubstratesaThe substrate concentrations were 2.3 mm NMP and 0.8 mm NTP.Activity%AMP/ATPbThe specific activity of T. brucei ADKG with the substrate set of AMP and ATP was 25.9 units/mg of protein and was taken as 100%.100CMP/ATP225UMP/ATP7.5GMP/ATP0.1IMP/ATP0.3AMP/CTP4.7AMP/UTP3.7AMP/GTP5.6AMP/ITP6.5a The substrate concentrations were 2.3 mm NMP and 0.8 mm NTP.b The specific activity of T. brucei ADKG with the substrate set of AMP and ATP was 25.9 units/mg of protein and was taken as 100%.

Open table in a new tab Building ADKs into Two Distinct Flagellar Structures—To probe the subcellular localization of the three trypanosome ADKs with unusually long leader sequences upstream of the conserved P-loop, we engineered TbADKA, TbADKB, and TbADKE to encode proteins that were tagged at their respective C termini with a single Ty epitope. Recombinant genes were then integrated by homologous recombination into the genome, and expression of the Ty-tagged proteins was determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence using the anti-Ty BB2 antibody (29Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence images for ADKA::Ty were reported previously (45Pullen T.J. Ginger M.L. Gaskell S.J. Gull K. Mol. Biol.

On immunoblots a single crossreactive protein of the expected molecular mass (∼30 kDa) was observed only in cell lines expressing a Ty epitope-tagged protein (data not shown). Immunofluorescence signals were also observed only in cells expressing either ADKA::Ty, ADKB::Ty, or ADKE::Ty but not in the untransfected parental cell line, and this signal indicated t"
https://openalex.org/W2073821450,"In non-mammalian vertebrates, the pineal gland is photoreceptive and contains an intrinsic circadian oscillator that drives rhythmic production and secretion of melatonin. These features require an accurate spatiotemporal expression of an array of specific genes in the pineal gland. Among these is the arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, a key enzyme in the melatonin production pathway. In zebrafish, pineal specificity of zfaanat2 is determined by a region designated the pineal-restrictive downstream module (PRDM), which contains three photoreceptor conserved elements (PCEs) and an E-box, elements that are generally associated with photoreceptor-specific and rhythmic expression, respectively. Here, by using in vivo and in vitro approaches, it was found that the PCEs and E-box of the PRDM mediate a synergistic effect of the photoreceptor-specific homeobox OTX5 and rhythmically expressed clock protein heterodimer, BMAL/CLOCK, on zfaanat2 expression. Furthermore, the distance between the PCEs and the E-box was found to be critical for PRDM function, suggesting a possible physical feature of this synergistic interaction. OTX5-BMAL/CLOCK may act through this mechanism to simultaneously control pineal-specific and rhythmic expression of zfaanat2 and possibly also other pineal and retinal genes. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the pineal gland is photoreceptive and contains an intrinsic circadian oscillator that drives rhythmic production and secretion of melatonin. These features require an accurate spatiotemporal expression of an array of specific genes in the pineal gland.

In zebrafish, pineal specificity of zfaanat2 is determined by a region designated the pineal-restrictive downstream module (PRDM), which contains three photoreceptor conserved elements (PCEs) and an E-box, elements that are generally associated with photoreceptor-specific and rhythmic expression, respectively. Here, by using in vivo and in vitro approaches, it was found that the PCEs and E-box of the PRDM mediate a synergistic effect of the photoreceptor-specific homeobox OTX5 and rhythmically expressed clock protein heterodimer, BMAL/CLOCK, on zfaanat2 expression. Furthermore, the distance between the PCEs and the E-box was found to be critical for PRDM function, suggesting a possible physical feature of this synergistic interaction. OTX5-BMAL/CLOCK may act through this mechanism to simultaneously control pineal-specific and rhythmic expression of zfaanat2 and possibly also other pineal and retinal genes. The pineal gland (epiphysis) influences daily and annual physiological changes by transducing the 24-h rhythm in light and darkness into a rhythm in circulating melatonin; in all vertebrates, circulating melatonin is elevated at night (1Arendt J. Melatonin and the Mammalian Pineal Gland. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1995: 27-127Google Scholar). This rhythm is generated by large changes in the activity of arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), 1The abbreviations used are: AANAT, arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase, serotonin N-acetyltransferase; PRDM, pineal-restrictive downstream module; OTX5, orthodenticle homeobox 5; BMAL, brain and muscle Arnt-like protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CRX, cone rod homeobox; DsRed, Discosoma red fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PCE, photoreceptor conserved element; MO, morpholino-modified antisense oligonucleotides; AVP, vasopressin; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; PCEs, photoreceptor conserved elements; WT, wild type; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; dpf, days post-fertilization; hpf, h post-fertilization. the next-to-last enzyme in melatonin synthesis (2Klein D.C.

Res. 1997; 52: 307-357PubMed Google Scholar). Aanat is expressed at high levels in the vertebrate pineal gland and to a variable degree in retinal photoreceptors, reflecting the common evolutionary origin of vertebrate photoreceptors (3Ekstrom P. Meissl H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 1679-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Klein D.C. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2004; 19: 264-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); expression in other tissues is undetectable. Fish have two aanats, aanat1 and aanat2, which are preferentially expressed in the retina and pineal gland, respectively (5Coon S.L. Begay V. Deurloo D. Falcon J. Klein D.C. J. Biol.

In some but not all vertebrates, the large changes in pineal AANAT activity reflect a transcriptional regulation by a circadian clock (1Arendt J. Melatonin and the Mammalian Pineal Gland.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4895-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In lower vertebrates, this clock is located within the pinealocytes (10Falcon J. Prog. Neurobiol. (N. Y.). 1999; 58: 121-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Consequently, these pineal glands exhibit rhythmic aanat expression in culture (11Bernard M. Klein D.C. Zatz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Begay V. Falcon J. Cahill G.M. Klein D.C. Coon S.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Zebrafish aanat2 (zfaanat2) displays two regulatory features, pineal/retinal photoreceptor specificity and daily rhythmicity (9Gothilf Y. Coon S.L. Toyama R. Chitnis A. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4895-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Gamse J.T. Shen Y.C. Thisse C. Thisse B. Raymond P.A. Halpern M.E. Liang J.O. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Developmentally, the zebrafish pineal gland is formed prior to the retina; zfaanat2 expression in the pineal gland begins as early as 22 h post-fertilization (hpf), whereas retinal zfaanat2 expression begins 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) (9Gothilf Y. Coon S.L. Toyama R. Chitnis A. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4895-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Pineal specificity of zfaanat2 is conferred by a downstream enhancer termed the pineal-restrictive downstream module (PRDM) (14Appelbaum L. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Baler R. Gothilf Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This sequence was shown to enhance the activity of zfaanat2 and other promoters in the pineal gland and to silence expression of zfaanat2 in other tissues. Thus, the PRDM can be viewed as an enhancer with a dual function. The 257-bp PRDM sequence contains two known regulatory elements, the PCE and the E-box; the former is present in triplicate and the latter as a single copy. Functional analysis has revealed that these elements are crucial for the PRDM-mediated pineal-specific expression (14Appelbaum L. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Baler R. Gothilf Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Studies in rodents indicate that PCE recruits members of the cone rod homeobox (crx) gene family (15Chen S. Wang Q.L.

Genet. 1999; 23: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), that it is present in the promoter region of aanat (16Li X. Chen S. Wang Q. Zack D.J. Snyder S.H. Borjigin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1876-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and that transcript levels of aanat in the pineal gland are greatly reduced in Crx-/- mice, providing evidence for the action of mammalian CRX on aanat expression (17Furukawa T. Morrow E.M. Li T. Davis F.C. Cepko C.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Evidence also exists for a role of the zebrafish CRX ortholog (18Plouhinec J.L. Sauka-Spengler T. Germot A. Le Mentec C. Cabana T. Harrison G. Pieau C. Sire J.Y. Veron G. Mazan S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), orthodenticle homeobox 5 (OTX5), in zfaanat2 regulation. Specifically, OTX5 knockdown has been shown to diminish zfaanat2 expression in the pineal gland (13Gamse J.T. Shen Y.C. Thisse C. Thisse B. Raymond P.A. Halpern M.E. Liang J.O. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which OTX5 enhances zfaanat2 expression in the pineal gland has not been investigated; OTX5 may act through PCEs located in the zfaanat2 promoter region and/or the PRDM (14Appelbaum L. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Baler R. Gothilf Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Gothilf Y. Toyama R. Coon S.L. Du S.J. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although PCEs appear to be linked to pineal/retinal photoreceptor specificity, the second PRDM element of interest, the E-box, is generally associated with transcriptional regulation by the positive and negative components of the circadian oscillator in these tissues (20Kyriacou C.P. Rosato E. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2000; 15: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Muñoz E. Baler R. Chronobiol. Int. 2003; 20: 371-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The positive element, a heterodimer of two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, BMAL and CLOCK, activates transcription through binding to an E-box element, and the negative components, PERIOD and CRYPTOCHROME, inhibit the activity of BMAL/CLOCK (22Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 23Cahill G.M. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 309: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Tamai T.K. Vardhanabhuti V. Arthur S. Foulkes N.S. Whitmore D. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2003; 15: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Clock-controlled genes usually contain one or more E-boxes in their promoter regions that mediate this action (25Jin X. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Zylka M.J. de Vries G.J. Reppert S.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 26Pando M.P. Sassone-Corsi P. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Rhythmic expression of aanat in the chicken pineal gland and the rat retina is thought to reflect this mechanism (27Chong N.W. Bernard M. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32991-83299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Chen W. Baler R. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 2000; 81: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Likewise, fish aanats typically contain E-boxes in their proximal promoter (19Gothilf Y. Toyama R. Coon S.L. Du S.J. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); in the case of zfaanat2, an E-box occurs also in the PRDM (14Appelbaum L. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Baler R. Gothilf Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The functional role of these E-boxes in mediating circadian transcription, however, has not been determined. To examine the regulatory mechanisms that are mediated by the PCEs within the PRDM and E-box and the relationship between these elements/mechanisms, in vivo gene knockdown analyses in combination with stable and transient expression, and in vitro transfection analyses of modified PRDM constructs in combinations with BMAL/CLOCK and OTX5 expression vectors have been done. In addition, in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to examine whether the precise physical relationship of the PCEs and the E-box is critical for the PRDM-mediated mechanisms to take place. The results of these studies are presented here. AANAT2-EGFP-PRDM and Insertions—The distance between PRDM E-box and PCE1 was increased from 9 to 15 and 19 nucleotides. Initially six nucleotides were inserted between the two elements. Two complementary primers were utilized to introduce a six-nucleotide insertion (Fig. 1B) into the AANAT2-EGFP-PRDM construct (14Appelbaum L. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Baler R. Gothilf Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as instructed by the manufacturer, yielding AANAT2-EGFP-PRDM-M6. Next, a four-nucleotide insertion (Fig. 1B) was introduced into AANAT2-EGFP-PRDM-M6 yielding the construct AANAT2-EGFP-PRDM-M10. These insertions increased the distance between the E-box and the PCEs without changing the immediately adjacent 7–9 bases that could affect recognition and binding affinity (Fig. 1B). AANAT2-DsRed-PRDM and CMV-EGFP-PRDM—These constructs were prepared as described previously (14Appelbaum L. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Baler R. Gothilf Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). AA1M-PRDM—PRDM (GenBank™ accession number AY380805) was placed in a luciferase reporter vector that contained an E-box-mutated AVP promoter (AA1M; see Ref. 29Muñoz E. Brewer M. Baler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36009-36017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This extensively characterized promoter was completely insensitive to BMAL/CLOCK transactivation (29Muñoz E. Brewer M. Baler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36009-36017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The PRDM was PCR-amplified by using AANAT2-EGFP-PRDM as a template and sets of primers containing NheI and KpnI restriction sites. The PCR product was double-digested with NheI and KpnI and ligated into NheI/KpnI-cut AA1M, yielding construct AA1M-PRDM. AA1M-PRDM-ME—PRDM with a mutated E-box (PRDM-ME, CACGTG to CTCGAG) was PCR-amplified by using AANAT2-EGFP-PRDM-ME (14Appelbaum L. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Baler R. Gothilf Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as a template and subcloned into AA1M, upstream of the AVP promoter, as described above, yielding the construct AA1M-PRDM-ME. AA1M-PRDM and PCE Mutation—The three PCEs within the PRDM were mutated. For each PCE, two complementary primers containing the desired mutation (TAATC (PCE1) to AGATC, GATTA (PCE2) to GTATA, and TAATC (PCE3) to ATATC) were utilized to introduce the mutations into AA1M-PRDM as described above. Consequently, novel restriction sites, BglII, EcoRV, and BsTZ17I, were introduced into the sequence in place of PCE1, PCE2, and PCE3, respectively. Mutated colonies were selected based on their digestion pattern with the above enzymes, and the presence of mutation was confirmed by sequencing. These constructs were named AA1M-PRDM-MP1, -MP2, and -MP3. Next, AA1M-PRDM-MP1 was sequentially mutated at PCE2 and PCE3 to get a triple PCE mutation construct AA1M-PRDM-MP. AA1M-PRDM and Insertion—Six and 10 nucleotides were inserted in AA1M-PRDM between the E-box and PCE1 using a similar procedure and similar sequences as used for AANAT2-EGFP-PRDM insertions, yielding constructs AA1M-PRDM-M6 and AA1M-PRDM-M10.

Mammalian expression vectors for human USF-1 (hUSF-1) and mouse USF-2 (mUSF-2, SV40 promoter-driven) were gifts from Dr. M. Sawadogo, University of Texas. Zebrafish OTX5 expression vector (CMV-driven) was generously provided by Dr. Jennifer Liang, Case Western Reserve University. Gene knockdown experiments were performed using morpholino-modified antisense oligonucleotides (MO) (30Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar, 31Heasman J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). MOs were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR). All MOs were designed according to the manufacturer's recommendations in order to bind to the sequences flanking and including the translation start codon (AUG). Sequences were as follows (sequence complementary to the start codon is underlined): OTX5 MO, CATGACTAAACTCTCTCTCTCTCTC (a gift from Dr. Reiko Toyama, NICHD, National Institutes of Health); BMAL1/3 MO, ATATCCATTCTTTGGTCTGCCATTA; BMAL2 MO, CAGATTTCATTTCCAGGTTGTCCAT; CLOCK1 MO, AGATACTGCTGTCATCCCGGTCTAT; CLOCK2 MO, TGTCCATGCTCACTCCTTCTCCCAT; CLOCK3 MO, ATGATAACTCGGTCTCATGGATCAG; and EGFP MO, ACAGCTCCTCGCCCTTGCTCACCAT. To test for morpholino specificity, BLAST analysis was performed using zebrafish genome sequence assembly from the Sanger Institute. None of the MOs are predicted to bind to gene sequences other than those targeted. Adult TG(AANAT2:EGFP)Y8 transgenic zebrafish (19Gothilf Y. Toyama R. Coon S.L. Du S.J. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which express EGFP in the pineal gland under the control of the zfaanat2 regulatory regions, were used. They were anesthetized (at ZT 1 and ZT 13) in 1.5 mm Tricane (Sigma) and sacrificed by decapitation; the pineal glands were isolated and removed under a fluorescent dissecting microscope. The use of fluorescent pineal glands facilitated the selective removal of pineal tissue. Total RNA was extracted using TriPure RNA isolation reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and was used as a template for synthesis of single strand 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE cDNA libraries using the SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocols. NIH-3T3 cells (ATCC, CRL-1658) were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells per well in a 24-well plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and transfected 24 h later with a mixture containing Lipofectamine Plus (1.25/2.5 μl) reagents (Invitrogen), 10 ng of luciferase reporter vector driven by the AA1M-PRDM promoter (wild type (WT) and mutated versions), and 0.75 μg of a 1:1:1 expression vector mix (hBMAL1/mCLOCK/zOTX5 or hUSF1/mUSF2/zOTX5) or empty vector pcDNA (Invitrogen) in 50 μl of Vitacell Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA) without fetal bovine serum. On the following day, 0.5 ml of culture medium (Vitacell Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented 10% fetal bovine serum) was added to each well; plates were harvested 24 h later. Differences in transfection efficiency were taken into account by measuring the enzyme activity generated by a co-transfected thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid (0.5 ng). Firefly and Renilla luciferase enzyme activities were measured using the Stop and Glo kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions, and relative luciferase activity was determined for each well. To determine the effect of the mutations and of BMAL/CLOCK, OTX5, and their interaction, data were subjected to three-way ANOVA analysis. Results are the mean of at least three independent experiments each performed in triplicate. In vivo transient expression assays of the EGFP-containing constructs were performed by microinjection of zebrafish embryos. Purified DNA constructs were diluted to 100 ng/μl in injection solution (0.1 m KCl, 0.05% phenol red). In co-injection experiments, constructs were dissolved together to a final concentration of 100 ng/μl each. In vivo knockdown assays were performed by microinjection of MOs at 0.8–4 μg/μl injection solution. Approximately 2 nl were injected into the cytoplasm of one-cell stage embryos using a micromanipulator and PV830 Pneumatic Pico Pump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). In some experiments plasmids and MOs were injected together. One hundred to 400 embryos were injected using 3–4 different needles in each experiment and were incubated in 10-cm plastic dishes at 28 °C. To calibrate and determine the dosage required for protein knock-down in the pineal gland, different doses of EGFP MO (0.16, 0.83, 4.1, 8.3, and 16.6 ng) were microinjected into one-cell stage TG(AANAT2: EGFP)Y8 embryos, and EGFP expression levels were monitored daily until 14 dpf. EGFP MO injection delayed the appearance of EGFP expression in a dose-dependent manner. Most embryos that were microinjected with 0.83–8.3 ng developed normally, and pineal EGFP expression was delayed until 12 dpf. The highest dose, 16.6 ng, caused developmental abnormalities, and the lowest dose, 0.16 ng, was ineffective (data not shown). Thus, injection of MO at 0.8–8 ng offers an efficient method for prolonged gene knockdown in the pineal gland. Adult zebrafish were raised in a light and temperature-controlled recirculation water system under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 28 °C and fed twice a day. To produce embryos, male and female zebrafish were paired in the evening, and spawning occurred within 1 h of the light cycle. Heterozygous TG(AANAT2:EGFP)Y8 transgenic embryos were obtained from an outcross of adult heterozygous TG(AANAT: EGFP)Y8 and WT fish. Injected embryos were placed in 10-cm Petri dishes with egg water containing methylene blue (0.3 ppm) and raised in a light-controlled refrigerated incubator at 28 °C. To prevent pigmentation, egg water was supplemented with 0.2 mm phenylthiocarbamide. Fluorescent protein expression in live embryos/larvae was determined under a stereo dissecting microscope (SZX12, Olympus) equipped with appropriate set of filters for excitation (460–490 nm for EGFP and 460–560 nm for DsRed) and emission (510–550 nm for EGFP and 550–590 nm for DsRed). In transient expression assays, embryos were sorted on the bases of their expression pattern, pineal-specific, ectopic, or both (14Appelbaum L. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Baler R. Gothilf Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), on days 2–5 of development, and results were subjected to χ2 analysis. In OTX5 knockdown assays, embryos/larvae were examined daily for pineal gland EGFP expression until 14 dpf. Embryos/larvae that were subjected to whole mount in situ hybridization were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in 100% methanol. In situ hybridization for the detection and quantification of zfaanat2 mRNA was as described (9Gothilf Y. Coon S.L. Toyama R. Chitnis A. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4895-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The difference in the mean signal intensity between day and night and between treatments was determined using two-way ANOVA analysis. Bmal and Clock Transcripts Are Expressed in the Zebrafish Pineal Gland—In zebrafish, three bmal and three clock genes have been identified (32Whitmore D. Foulkes N.S. Strahle U. Sassone-Corsi P. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 33Cermakian N. Whitmore D. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) of which zfclock1, zfbmal1, and zfbmal2 transcripts have been shown to be expressed in the pineal gland (32Whitmore D. Foulkes N.S. Strahle U. Sassone-Corsi P. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 33Cermakian N. Whitmore D. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4339-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The presence of all six transcripts in the pineal gland was determined by PCR using adult TG(AANT2: EGFP)Y8 pineal-exclusive cDNA as a template. Fragments of the cDNAs encoding for zCLOCK1–3 and zBMAL1–3 were successfully amplified (data not shown), indicating that all six transcripts are present in this tissue. BMAL/CLOCK Enhances zfaanat2 Expression in Vivo—In zebrafish, pineal zfaanat2 expression begins at 22 hpf and a circadian clock-controlled rhythm of its transcript begins 2 dpf (9Gothilf Y. Coon S.L. Toyama R. Chitnis A. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4895-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To test in vivo the effect of BMAL/CLOCK heterodimers on zfaanat2 expression, knockdown experiments were performed. Embryos were kept under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle during the first 2 days of development, after which they were transferred to constant darkness. Embryos were collected at subjective mid-day and mid-night of the 3rd day of development, and zfaanat2 mRNA levels were monitored by whole mount in situ hybridization. Non-injected embryos exhibited significant (p < 0.001) day/night differences in zfaanat2 expression (Fig. 2), as documented previously (9Gothilf Y. Coon S.L. Toyama R. Chitnis A. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4895-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Gamse J.T. Shen Y.C. Thisse C. Thisse B. Raymond P.A. Halpern M.E. Liang J.O. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A similar expression pattern was observed in embryos injected with 8 ng of control EGFP MO (Fig. 2), indicating that incompatible MO has no effect on zfaanat2 expression. In contrast, microinjection of the mixture (1.6 ng each) of the BMAL/CLOCK MO resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in the level of zfaanat2 mRNA and a reduction in the day/night differences (Fig. 2); injection of each MO separately was ineffective, probably reflecting functional redundancy of these proteins (35Tauber E. Last K.S. Olive P.J. Kyriacou C.P. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2004; 19: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In accordance, the use of MOs directed toward negative components of the circadian oscillator resulted in a significant increase in zfaanat2 expression. 2L. Ziv and Y. Gothilf, unpublished results. The reduction in zfaanat2 mRNA in response to BMAL/CLOCK knockdown may reflect a general disruption of the circadian clock. Because, as mentioned above, BMAL/CLOCK heterodimer enhances the expression of rat and chicken aanat through E-box elements, it is reasonable to suggest that this heterodimer may directly enhance the expression of zfaanat2 in the pineal gland. BMAL/CLOCK Dimers Activate Expression through PRDM E-box—Previous in vivo mutational analyses indicated that the perfect E-box located within the PRDM is required for enhancing the expression of zfaanat2 in the pineal gland (14Appelbaum L. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Baler R. Gothilf Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To test whether BMAL/CLOCK heterodimers activate zfaanat2 transcription through this E-box, AA1M-PRDM was co-transfected into NIH-3T3 cells with either an empty vector (pcDNA) or a 1:1 mixture of mBMAL and hCLOCK expression vectors. Reporter gene expression driven by PRDM was significantly (p < 0.001) enhanced 3-fold in the presence of hBMAL/mCLOCK (Fig. 3A). Moreover, when the E-box was mutagenized (AA1M-PRDM-ME construct), the heterodimer failed to transactivate the chimeric promoter (Fig. 3A). In contrast, E-box mutation did not alter the stimulatory action of USF, a bHLH protein known to bind E-boxes (36Potter J.J. Cheneval D. Dang C.V. Resar L.M. Mezey E. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15457-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results suggest that the BMAL/CLOCK heterodimer binds to the PRDM-E-box, resulting in increased transcription. OTX5 Enhances Pineal Expression in Vivo through PRDM— Zebrafish OTX5 augments zfaanat2 expression in the pineal gland (13Gamse J.T. Shen Y.C. Thisse C. Thisse B. Raymond P.A. Halpern M.E. Liang J.O. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The capability of OTX5 to enhance zfaanat2 promoter activity in the pineal gland was tested in vivo by OTX5 knockdown. Transgenic embryos, TG(AANAT2:EGFP)Y8, were microinjected with OTX5 MO. The appearance of the EGFP signal in the pineal gland of OTX5 MO-injected embryos was delayed; expression of EGFP in injected embryos (88 individuals) could be detected only at 48 hpf, whereas the control embryos exhibited the typical 24-hpf EGFP-positive pineal gland. In addition, signal intensity was drastically reduced in injected embryos until the 6th day of development (Fig. 4). The fact that EGFP expression in OTX5 morphants recovered indicates that pineal development was not disrupted by OTX5 MO injection. The transgene in TG(AANAT2:EGFP)Y8 fish consists of the 1.8-kb 5′ and 3.5-kb 3′ regulatory region (19Gothilf Y. Toyama R. Coon S.L. Du S.J. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Dev.

We previously identified a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif in the N terminus of S6K1 that is required for its mTOR-dependent activation. Furthermore, our data suggested that the TOS motif suppresses an inhibitory function associated with the C terminus of S6K1. Here, we have characterized the mTOR-regulated inhibitory region within the C terminus. We have identified a conserved C-terminal “RSPRR” sequence that is responsible for an mTOR-dependent suppression of S6K1 activation. Deletion or mutations within this RSPRR motif partially rescue the kinase activity of the S6K1 TOS motif mutant (S6K1-F5A), and this rescued activity is rapamycin resistant. Furthermore, we have shown that the RSPRR motif significantly suppresses S6K1 phosphorylation at two phosphorylation sites (Thr-389 and Thr-229) that are crucial for S6K1 activation. Importantly, introducing both the Thr-389 phosphomimetic and RSPRR motif mutations into the catalytically inactive S6K1 mutant S6K1-F5A completely rescues its activity and renders it fully rapamycin resistant. These data show that the N-terminal TOS motif suppresses an inhibitory function mediated by the C-terminal RSPRR motif.

The best-characterized function of mTOR is the regulation of translation initiation via the ribosomal protein S6 kinases 1 and 2 (S6K1 and S6K2) and the translational inhibitors, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BP1/2/3) (3Gingras A.C.

Consistent with the S6K knock-out experiments, RNA interference-mediated reduction of S6K1 expression reduces cell size, whereas overexpression of S6K1 increases cell size (5Fingar D.C. Salama S.

Mitogen- and mTOR-dependent pathways coordinately regulate the activity of S6K1 by phosphorylation of at least 8 Ser/Thr residues (reviewed in Ref. 4Martin K.A. Blenis J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 86: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway is a major mitogen-dependent contributor of S6K1 activation, which is mediated by a variety of effectors, including Akt/protein kinase B, 3-phosphinositide-dependent kinase 1, protein kinase Cζ, and the small G proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 (reviewed in Ref. 4Martin K.A. Blenis J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 86: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Direct phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr-229 by 3-phosphinositide-dependent kinase 1 is a crucial step in S6K1 activation. mTOR-dependent signaling is absolutely required for S6K1 activation. For instance, treatment of cells with the specific mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, causes rapid dephosphorylation of S6K1 at several sites, namely Thr-389, Thr-229 and Ser-404 (7Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B.

Thr-389, a phosphorylation site situated within a hydrophobic amino acid motif in the linker region, is the most rapamycinsensitive site, and its phosphorylation is crucial for S6K1 phosphotransferase activity. We previously identified a conserved TOR signaling (TOS) motif in the N terminus of S6K1 and in the C terminus of 4E-BP1 that is required for mTOR-dependent S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (9Schalm S.S.

This TOS motif facilitates the association of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 to the mTOR regulator raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and their efficient in vitro phosphorylation by the mTOR-raptor complex (10Schalm S.S.

We showed that a single point mutation in the TOS motif (S6K1-F5A) prevented the mTOR signaling input to S6K1 (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Mimicking Thr-389 phosphorylation by mutating this site to an acidic residue (S6K1-F5A-E389) partially rescued the activity of this inactive, mTOR-insensitive mutant (S6K1-F5A). A combination of the Thr-389 phosphomimetic mutant with a C-terminal deletion (F5A-E389ΔCT401) rescued the inhibitory effect of the TOS mutant and rendered it rapamycin resistant (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These data indicated that the TOS motif mediates mTOR-dependent S6K1 activation by at least two mechanisms: direct phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif site Thr-389 and suppression of an inhibitory activity associated with the C terminus of S6K1 (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified a conserved sequence in the C terminus of S6K1 (RSPRR) that mediates an inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. Deletion of or mutation within the conserved C-terminal RSPRR motif partially rescued a catalytically inactive TOS motif mutant (S6K1-F5A) and rendered S6K1 partially rapamycin resistant. Furthermore, a combination of an RSPRR motif mutation and mimicking of Thr-389 phosphorylation completely rescued the activity of S6K1-F5A and generated a mutant of S6K1 that was completely rapamycin resistant. We propose that the RSPRR motif interacts with a negative regulator of S6K1 that is suppressed by mTOR. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The HA-S6K1 (wild-type, HA-S6K1-ΔCT401, HA-S6K1-F5A, HA-S6K1-F5A-ΔCT401, and HA-S6K1-F5A-E389ΔCT401) constructs were generated as previously described (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J.

C-terminal truncation S6K1 mutants were generated by introducing a premature stop codon into the coding sequence of S6K1. Antibodies—Anti-HA antibodies were kindly provided by M. Chou (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). The anti-S6K1-phospho-Thr-389 and -Thr-229 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Inc.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Western Blotting—HEK293E cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 20 units/ml penicillin, and 200 ng/ml streptomycin. Ca2PO4 transfections were performed as previously described (13Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Romanelli A. Keon K.L. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7892-7898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were harvested and Western blot analysis was carried out as before (13Martin K.A.

Immune Complex Kinase Assay—For immunoprecipitation studies of HA-tagged S6K1, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h.

S6K1 kinase activity was determined in vitro by using recombinant GST-S6 (32 C-terminal amino acids of ribosomal protein S6) as a substrate as described previously (13Martin K.A. Schalm S.S.

Quantification of incorporation of the 32P label was quantified by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad) with ImageQuant software. Characterization of the C-terminal Inhibitory Region of S6K1—Deletion of the S6K1 C terminus (S6K1-ΔCT401) or the S6K2 C terminus (S6K2-ΔCT401) renders these kinases partially rapamycin resistant (Refs. 14Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 15Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, and data not shown), suggesting an mTOR-regulated, inhibitory activity associated with the C terminus (discussed in Schalm and Blenis, Ref. 9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To identify the region in the C terminus responsible for this inhibitory effect, we generated a series of progressively shorter C-terminal truncation mutants (see Fig. 1A) and assayed their kinase activities under starved, insulin-stimulated, or rapamycin-treated conditions (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the partial rapamycin-resistant S6K1-ΔCT401 mutant, C-terminal truncation mutants at amino acids 417 (S6K1-ΔCT417) and 422 (S6K1-ΔCT422) were completely sensitive to rapamycin (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the region between amino acids 401 and 417 possesses an mTOR-antagonized inhibitory activity. In the presence of rapamycin, this inhibitory function is no longer suppressed and S6K1 activation is therefore prevented. Phosphorylation of Ser-404 Does Not Regulate the Inhibitory Function of the C Terminus—This 16-amino acid region within the C terminus contains two interesting features: a rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation site, Ser-404, and a highly conserved 5-amino acid motif (RSPRR) (see Fig. 1A). A second partially conserved SPR motif (amino acids 417–420, Fig. 1A) seemed to be dispensable for this inhibitory effect, as its presence (S6K1-ΔCT422) or absence (S6K1-ΔCT417) did not affect the rapamycin sensitivity of S6K1 (see Fig. 1B). To determine whether Ser-404 phosphorylation contributed to the inhibitory property of the C terminus, Ser-404 was mutated to Asp to mimic phosphorylation or to Ala to prevent phosphorylation. When compared with wild-type protein, mutation of Ser-404 to Asp or Ala did not alter the rapamycin sensitivity of S6K1 (Fig. 2), making it unlikely that Ser-404 phosphorylation mediates the inhibitory function. C-terminal Deletions from Amino Acids 401 or 409 Rescue the Kinase Activity of the S6K1 TOS Motif Mutant S6K1-F5A—The very weak insulin-stimulated activity of the S6K1 TOS motif mutant S6K1-F5A was partially restored (to 5–15% of wild-type S6K1) upon deletion of the C terminus (S6K1-F5A-ΔCT401) (Fig. 3A) (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To identify the inhibitory region within the C terminus, we examined which of the C-terminal truncation mutants rescued the kinase activity of S6K1-F5A (Fig. 3A). Deletion of the extreme 92 C-terminal amino acids (ΔCT409) partially rescued the inhibitory effect of the TOS motif mutant, similar to that of F5A-ΔCT401. The rescued kinase activity of S6K1-F5A-ΔCT409 was completely insensitive to rapamycin, as observed for F5A-ΔCT401. In contrast, deletion of the extreme 83 C-terminal amino acids (F5A-ΔCT417) did not rescue the inhibitory effect of the TOS motif mutant S6K1-F5A. These data indicate that the amino acid sequence between residues 409 and 417 mediates the mTOR-regulated inhibitory effect on S6K1 kinase activity. It is possible that the C-terminal region between residues 409 and 417 inhibits phosphorylation of S6K1 at an mTOR-regulated site. Two rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation sites important for S6K1 activation (Thr-229 and Thr-389) are likely candidates. As seen in Fig. 3C, Thr-229 and Thr-389 were phosphorylated in a rapamycin-insensitive manner in both F5A-ΔCT401 and F5A-ΔCT409. Interestingly, Thr-229 and Thr-389 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in F5A-ΔCT417, a mutant possessing the conserved RSPRR motif (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the S6K1 C-terminal region between residues 409 and 417 is required for the mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-229 and Thr-389. Thr-389 phosphorylation was insulin stimulated but rapamycin resistant in F5A-ΔCT401 and F5A-ΔCT409 (Fig. 3C), indicating that Thr-389 phosphorylation in these mutants was regulated by an insulin-dependent, but mTOR-independent (rapamycin-insensitive), input. Similarly, Thr-229 phosphorylation in F5A-ΔCT401 and F5A-ΔCT409 was partially rescued (when compared with F5A-S6K1) and was rapamycin resistant (Fig. 3C). However, Thr-229 phosphorylation in these mutants was already basally high and not further increased upon insulin stimulation. Thus, the C-terminal sequence between residues 409 and 417 appears to mediate an inhibitory effect on the basal phosphorylation of Thr-229. In contrast, the rapamycin-resistant phosphorylation site Ser-371 (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) was phosphorylated in F5A-ΔCT401 and F5A-ΔCT409 and to a lesser extent in F5A-ΔCT417. As reported before (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Ser-371 was not increased upon insulin stimulation and not affected by rapamycin treatment under our conditions. Thus, the RSPRR motif-mediated inhibition of S6K1 kinase seems to be mainly the result of suppression of Thr-229 and Thr-389 phosphorylation. Mimicking Thr-389 Phosphorylation within the F5A-ΔCT (409) Mutant Renders S6K1 Highly Active and Rapamycin Resistant—As shown previously, mimicking Thr-389 phosphorylation by mutating this residue to a glutamic acid weakly rescued the insulin-stimulated activity of the S6K1-F5A. In contrast, a combination of mimicking Thr-389 phosphorylation and deletion of the C terminus (S6K1-F5A-E389ΔCT401) completely overcame the inhibitory effect of the F5A mutation and rendered S6K1 constitutively active and rapamycin resistant (Fig. 4) (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To extend our characterization of the C terminus, we determined whether C-terminal truncations from residue 409 or residue 417 rescued S6K1 phosphotransferase activity in the context of the S6K1-F5A-E389 mutant. Indeed, truncation of the C terminus from amino acid 409 in the F5A-E389 mutant (referred to as S6K1-F5A-E389ΔCT409) completely rescued the kinase activity of S6K1-F5A in a manner similar to that of S6K1-F5A-E389ΔCT401. In contrast, truncation of the C terminus from amino acid 417 failed to rescue the kinase activity of S6K1-F5A-E389 (Fig. 4). Thus, in addition to Thr-389 phosphorylation, deletion of a negative regulatory region between amino acids 409–417 is needed to rescue the inhibitory effect caused by mutation of the TOS motif (F5A). Both S6K1-F5A-E389ΔCT401 and S6K1-F5A-E389ΔCT409 have a high basal Thr-229 phosphorylation, which is resistant to rapamycin and not further stimulated by insulin. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Thr-229 in these two S6K1 truncation mutants was significantly higher than that observed with wild-type S6K1 or S6K1-F5A-E389. Thus, the C-terminal S6K1 region between amino acids 409 and 417 is important for modulating Thr-229 phosphorylation, which is at least partially independent of Thr-389 phosphorylation. Alanine Point Mutations within the Conserved RSPRR Motif Rescue the Activity of S6K1 TOS Motif Mutant S6K1-F5A—To determine whether the RSPRR motif mediates the mTOR-modulated inhibitory function of the S6K1 C terminus, we asked whether mutations within this motif rescued the activity of S6K1-F5A analogous to the C-terminal deletion (S6K1-ΔCT401). Mutating either the three arginines or all the residues within the RSPRR motif to alanines (referred as 3A or 5A, respectively) partially rescued the inhibitory effect of the TOS motif mutant (Fig. 5). In contrast to F5A-ΔCT401 or F5A-ΔCT409 (Fig. 3B), however, the rescued activity of this mutant was only partially rapamycin resistant. We also noted that the insulin-stimulated activity of S6K1-F5A-3A and S6K1-F5A-5A was higher than that observed with F5A-ΔCT401 and F5A-ΔCT409 (Fig. 5). The alanine mutations of the RSPRR in the context of the TOS motif mutant increased the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr-229 and Thr-389 over that observed in the S6K1-F5A mutant, indicating that the RSPRR motif is important for the regulation of Thr-229 and Thr-389 phosphorylation. Furthermore, under non-stimulated conditions Thr-229 phosphorylation was high in S6K1-F5A-3A and S6K1-F5A-5A, consistent with the notion that the RSPRR motif affects basal phosphorylation of Thr-229. The insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr-389 in S6K1-F5A-3A and S6K1-F5A-5A was still rapamycin sensitive. These results suggest that other regions within the C terminus may also be important for regulating insulin-stimulated and rapamycin-sensitive Thr-389 phosphorylation. Mimicking Thr-389 Phosphorylation Renders the F5A-3A Mutant Fully Rapamycin Resistant with High Specific Activity— Finally, we wanted to determine whether mimicking Thr-389 phosphorylation rendered the RSPRR motif mutant S6K1-F5A-3A (referred to as S6K1-F5A-E389–3A) constitutively active and fully rapamycin resistant (Fig. 6). Indeed, S6K1-F5A-E389–3A had a high basal kinase activity that was not further stimulated by insulin and was completely rapamycin resistant, making it indistinguishable from the S6K1-F5A-E389ΔCT401 mutant. Moreover, phosphorylation of Thr-229 in S6K1-F5A-E389–3A was also completely rapamycin insensitive. These data suggest that the RSPRR motif, in the context of phosphorylated Thr-389, also directly contributes to the regulation of Thr-229 phosphorylation. Unlike Thr-389 phosphorylation, which may be directly phosphorylated by mTOR as well as indirectly regulated via the RSPRR motif, regulation of Thr-229 is not likely to be directly phosphorylated by mTOR (4Martin K.A. Blenis J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 86: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The mechanism of how mTOR signaling regulates multisite S6K1 phosphorylation and activation is poorly understood. Recently, we identified a conserved TOS motif in the N terminus of S6K1 (9Schalm S.S.

Mutating the S6K1 TOS motif (F5A) dramatically reduced S6K1 kinase activity and phosphorylation at Thr-389 and Thr-229 (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, mimicking Thr-389 phosphorylation by mutating this site to an acidic residue only partially rescued the activity of the TOS motif mutant S6K1-F5A (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), indicating that Thr-389 phosphorylation was not the only TOS motif-mediated input for S6K1 activation. Only a combination of mimicking Thr-389 phosphorylation and deletion of the C-terminal domain (F5A-E389ΔCT) completely overcame the inhibitory effect of the F5A mutation and rendered this S6K1 mutant fully active and rapamycin resistant (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In contrast to deletion of the C terminus, mimicking C-terminal phosphorylation was not sufficient to bring the activity of S6K1-F5A-E389 up to wild-type levels (9Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the TOS motif suppressed an inhibitory activity associated with the C terminus that was not due to C-terminal phosphorylation. Here, we have characterized this inhibitory function of the S6K1 C terminus. We show that a C-terminal deletion at amino acid 409, but not amino acid 417, rendered S6K1 partially rapamycin resistant and rescued the activity of the catalytically inactive TOS motif mutant (S6K1-F5A) (Figs. 1B and 3A). Thus, the region between amino acids 409 and 417 within the C terminus mediates an mTOR-dependent inhibitory function. Interestingly, this S6K1 C-terminal region contains an RSPRR motif, which is the only conserved sequence within the C terminus of all known S6 kinases (Fig. 1A). We show that mutating residues within this RSPRR motif to alanines partially rescued the kinase activity of S6K1-F5A (Fig. 5). Moreover, deletion or mutation of the RSPRR motif in combination with mimicking Thr-389 phosphorylation completely rescued the inhibitory effect of the TOS motif mutant (Fig. 6). How does the RSPRR motif affect S6K1 activation? The three phosphorylation sites, Thr-229, Thr-389, and Ser-404, still present in the S6K1 C-terminal truncation mutants are known to be rapamycin sensitive (7Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W.

Conflicting data exist about the rapamycin sensitivity of a fourth site, Ser-371 (16Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall R.E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell.

Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-404 does not appear to be important for the regulatory function of the RSPRR motif, as mutating Ser-404 to Asp to mimic phosphorylation did not affect the activity or rapamycin sensitivity of S6K1 (Fig. 2) (7Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 14Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr-389 is influenced by the RSPRR motif, as insulin-stimulated Thr-389 phosphorylation was increased in the S6K1 TOS motif mutants (S6K1-F5A) lacking an intact RSPRR motif (S6K1-F5A-3A, S6K1-F5A-5A, S6K1-F5A-ΔCT401, and S6K1-F5A-ΔCT409 (Fig. 2B) (4Martin K.A. Blenis J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 86: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but not in the S6K1 TOS motif mutants with an intact RSPRR motif (S6K1-F5A and S6K1-F5A-ΔCT417). Thus, the RSPRR motif prevents Thr-389 phosphorylation in the TOS motif mutant (S6K1-F5A). In addition to the effect of RSPRR mutations on S6K1 Thr-389 phosphorylation, basal phosphorylation of Thr-229 is also significantly elevated and rapamycin resistant in these S6K1 mutants (Fig. 5A) (6Fingar D.C. Richardson C.J. Tee A.R. Cheatham L. Tsou C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 200-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Consistently, deletion of the S6K1 C terminus has been reported to cause high basal Thr-229 phosphorylation (18Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 3-Phosphinositide-dependent kinase 1 is known to phosphorylate Thr-229, but its activity is insensitive to rapamycin. Our data suggest that the RSPRR motif negatively modulates Thr-229 phosphorylation. It is possible that this negative regulation may involve a phosphatase. Several lines of evidence suggest that a PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A)-like phosphatase mediates mTOR-dependent regulation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TOR regulation of several substrates involves PP2A-like phosphatases. Furthermore, PP2A has been shown to form a complex with S6K1 (19Westphal R.S. Coffee Jr., R.L. Marotta A. Pelech S.L. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 687-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and to bind to wild-type S6K1, but not to the rapamycin-resistant N- and C-terminal truncated form of S6K1 (20Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). It is likely that a PP2A-like phosphatase binds to the C terminus, possibly to the RSPRR motif. To date we have been unable to reproducibly detect PP2A association with S6K1, but ongoing studies are aimed at addressing this possibility. Summary—We have identified a highly conserved motif (RSPRR) within the C terminus of S6K1 that mediates an inhibitory effect on mTOR-dependent S6K1 activation. Without a positive mTOR input, the RSPRR motif suppresses S6K1 phosphorylation at Thr-389 and Thr-229. We anticipate that future work will reveal the identity of the RSPRR-associated negative regulator. Importantly, the full-length rapamycin-resistant S6K1 mutant (S6K1-F5A-E389–3A) described in this study will be a useful tool to study rapamycin-sensitive signaling through S6K1. For instance, defining S6K1 function in cultured cells is problematic as overexpression of S6K1 with an intact TOS motif inhibits mTOR-raptor signaling to its other TOS motif-containing targets (e.g. 4E-BP1). As a result, overexpression of S6 kinases indirectly interferes with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E function, complicating any interpretation of data using this experimental approach (21von Manteuffel S.R.

However, the mechanisms involved in modulating GR levels in the absence of hormone remain enigmatic. Here we demonstrate that TSG101, a previously identified GR-interacting protein, stabilizes the hypophosphorylated form of GR in the absence of ligand. We found that a non-phosphorylated version of GR (S203A/S211A) showed enhanced interaction with TSG101 as compared with the wild type GR, suggesting that TSG101 interacts more favorably with GR when it is not phosphorylated. A significant accumulation of GR S203A/S211A protein is detected in the absence of ligand when TSG101 is overexpressed, whereas no increase in the wild type phosphorylated GR or phosphomimetic GR S203E/S211E was observed in mammalian cells. In contrast, down-regulation of TSG101 expression by siRNA renders the hypophosphorylated form of GR unstable. We further show that TSG101 stabilizes GR by impeding its degradation by the proteasome and extending receptor half-life. Thus, in absence of a ligand, TSG101 binds GR and protects the non-phosphorylated receptor from degradation.

GR contains an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (activation function 1; AF-1), a central zinc finger DNA binding domain, and a C-terminal region responsible for hormone binding and transcriptional regulation via activation function 2 (AF-2) (1McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 2Yamamoto K.R. Harvey Lect. 1995; 91: 1-19PubMed Google Scholar). The inactive unliganded form of GR is largely cytoplasmic and is associated with the heat shock protein 90-based chaperone complex (3Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Upon glucocorticoid binding, GR undergoes a conformational change, dissociates from the chaperone complex, and translocates to the nucleus where it activates and represses gene transcription (4Lu N.Z. Cidlowski J.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1024: 102-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). GR is phosphorylated in the absence of hormone, and additional phosphorylation events occur in conjunction with agonist binding (5Orti E. Mendel D.B. Smith L.I. Munck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9728-9731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hoeck W. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5403-5408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wang Z. Garabedian M.J.

We have developed antibodies that specifically recognize GR phosphorylated at major hormone-dependent sites, serine 203 (Ser-203) and serine 211 (Ser-211) (9Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Using a battery of agonists and antagonists in combination with kinetic studies we demonstrated that phosphorylation of human GR is dynamic. In the absence of hormone only a small portion of the receptors are phosphorylated at Ser-211, and this fraction increases dramatically upon agonist binding, whereas under basal conditions a large receptor pool is phosphorylated at Ser-203, which further increases in the presence of hormone (9Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10Ismaili N. Garabedian M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1024: 86-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Our more recent findings suggest that in the absence of ligand GR is being constantly phosphorylated and dephosphorylated at Ser-203 and Ser-211. 2Z. Wang and M. J. Garabedian, unpublished observation.2Z. Wang and M. J. Garabedian, unpublished observation. Thus, in the absence of ligand, different subpopulations of phosphorylated GR are present in vivo. The hormone-activated GR regulates the transcription of target genes using specific receptor domains (e.g. AF-1 and AF-2) (12Rogatsky I. Wang J.C. Derynck M.K. Nonaka D.F. Khodabakhsh D.B. Haqq C.M. Darimont B.D. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13845-13850Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that interact with distinct transcriptional regulatory factors. The unliganded GR uses the C-terminal domain to recruit chaperones that confer high affinity ligand binding to the receptor (13Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 14Howard K.J. Holley S.J. Yamamoto K.R. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11928-11935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conceivably, the unliganded receptor employs additional domains and cofactors to control its localization or stability. To discover cofactors that interact with the N-terminal region of GR, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using this domain as bait and identified the tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) (15Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). TSG101 was originally identified in a screen for tumor suppressors (16Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in the regulation of cellular proliferation; mouse homozygous tsg101–/– embryos die during early embryogenesis, and TSG101-deficient embryos display decreased rates of proliferation, which correlate with the accumulation of p53 and p21 (17Ruland J. Sirard C. Elia A. MacPherson D. Wakeham A. Li L. de la Pompa J.L. Cohen S.N. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). TSG101 transcripts with different coding regions, attributed to alternative splicing, have been found in different carcinomas (18Lee M.P. Feinberg A.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3131-3134PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sun Z. Pan J. Bubley G. Balk S.P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3121-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The predicted TSG101 protein structure reveals a C-terminal coiled coil domain, a central proline-rich segment, and an N-terminal ubiquitin-conjugating E2 variant (UEV) domain that is catalytically inactive, because it lacks a cysteine residue required for thioester bond formation with ubiquitin. The coiled coil domain of TSG101 interacts with GR AF-1, and the overexpression of TSG101 inhibits GR transcriptional enhancement (15Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of TSG101 on transcriptional activity extends to other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family (20Sun Z. Pan J. Hope W.X. Cohen S.N. Balk S.P. Cancer. 1999; 86: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Watanabe M. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the case of the androgen receptor, inhibition of transcriptional activation was proposed to result from an interaction of TSG101 with the coactivator p300 (20Sun Z. Pan J. Hope W.X. Cohen S.N. Balk S.P. Cancer. 1999; 86: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Paradoxically for a transcriptional regulatory factor, the subcellular location of the TSG101 protein is largely non-nuclear, suggesting that TSG101 performs additional functions outside the nucleus (22Xie W. Li L. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because TSG101 is homologous to ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes, but is catalytically inactive, it has been suggested that TSG101 functions as a dominant negative regulator of ubiquitination (23Ponting C.P. Cai Y.D. Bork P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, recent studies reported the existence of a regulatory loop between TSG101 and MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase; the TSG101 UEV domain binds MDM2 and prevents polyubiquitination and degradation of MDM2, which in turn leads to down-regulation of p53, an MDM2 target (25Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, TSG101 affects ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (26Sundquist W.I. Schubert H.L. Kelly B.N. Hill G.C. Holton J.M. Hill C.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 783-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). TSG101 has also been implicated in the sorting and/or trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins. TSG101 interacts with hVSP28, a protein involved in vesicular trafficking (27Lemmon S.K. Traub L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and appears to be recruited to early endosomes (28Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, TSG101, through its N-terminal UEV domain, binds the HIV gag protein and leads to viral release (29Myers E.L. Allen J.F. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11226-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W. Morham S.G. Zavitz K.H. Wang H.E. Wettstein D.A. Stray K.M. Cote M. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Sundquist W.I. Cell. 2001; 107: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that TSG101 interacts with the GR N terminus and reduces receptor transcriptional activation when overexpressed, it is unclear whether this is the only role TSG101 plays in modulating GR function. TSG101 is localized outside the nucleus and functions, in part, as a regulator of protein stability. Given that GR is confined to the cytoplasm in the absence of hormone in a hypophosphorylated state, we examined whether GR phosphorylation could modulate GR-TSG101 interaction and whether TSG101 affects GR stability in the absence of ligand. Plasmids—The pCMV-hGR expression plasmid was used to produce an HA-tagged version of the human GR as well as the HA-tagged forms of the GR phosphorylation site-specific mutations (7Wang Z. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar). The pCMV-LacZ constitutively expresses β-galactosidase and is used as a marker for transfection efficiency. The untagged human TSG101 as well as myc-tagged human TSG101 expression vectors have been described previously (16Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 25Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Modified Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as described previously (15Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid “bait” proteins, 1) rat GR107–237 wild type, 2) rat GR107–237 30IIB, and 3) rat GR107–237 S224A/S232A are in pJG4/5, which contains the GAL1–10 promoter and expresses HA-tagged, B42 activation domain fusion proteins when grown in the presence of galactose. The TSG101 “prey” protein is constitutively expressed from the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter as a LexA DNA binding domain fusion protein to TSG101 residues 183–381 in pEG202. Bait and prey vectors, along with a β-galactosidase reporter gene with a single LexA-operator (pJK103), were transformed into yeast strain EGY 188. For quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assays, yeast were grown in selective liquid medium containing 2% glucose for 12 h, pelleted, washed once in H2O, normalized according to cell number, and resuspended to an optical density (A600) of 0.15 in 2% galactose, 1% raffinose medium. β-Galactosidase assays were performed 12 h later as described previously (31Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1245-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone), 2 mm l-glutamine (Cellgro), and 10 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin (Cellgro). Cells were seeded on 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 using antibiotic- and phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS and 2 mm l-glutamine 24 h prior to the transfection. Transfections were performed in phenol red-free DMEM without serum using the cationic polymer Exgen 500 (MBI Fermentas) according to manufacturer's recommendation. Total amount of DNA transfected is held constant in each transfection using an equivalent empty vector. Four hours post-transfection, an equal volume of phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 20% charcoal stripped-FBS and 4 mm l-glutamine was added to the transfection medium. Cells were treated with 100 nm dexamethasone or ethanol vehicle for 16–18 h, and whole cell lysates were prepared. For receptor half-life experiments, HeLa cells were transfected, and 18-h post transfection the cells were treated with 1 μm cycloheximide (Sigma) for 2, 4, and 8 h, and whole cell lysates were prepared. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation of transfected GR, HeLa cells (10-cm dish) expressing the indicated receptor derivative or vector alone were lysed in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C with 10 μg of HA monoclonal antibody for 5 h. A 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl) were added to the reaction for an additional 2 h. The supernatant was removed, and beads were washed four times in 0.5× lysis buffer. The pelleted beads were resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min prior to loading onto a gel. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous GR, a 10-cm dish of HeLa cells that was 90% confluent was lysed in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Protein A-Sepharose beads (100 μl) were coupled to GR Ser(P)-203 antibody, using the cross-linker dimethyl pimelimidate as per the manufactures instructions (Pierce). For the control reaction, beads were coupled to a nonspecific rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody. The beads were added to the lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the unbound fraction from the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and equal amounts of protein were loaded on the gel. The bound fraction in the beads was washed three times in 0.5× lysis buffer and once with PBS. The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and cooled, and a portion of the sample was run on a gel. RNA Interference—A small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex specific for the human TSG101 was designed as described previously (32Hewitt E.W. Duncan L. Mufti D. Baker J. Stevenson P.G. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2418-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and was synthesized by Dharmacon. The nonspecific siRNA duplex used as a negative control targets luciferase (5′-CUU ACG CUG AGU ACU UCG AdTdT; Dharmacon). siRNA transfections were carried out by seeding HeLa cells in 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 in antibiotic- and phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped-FBS and 2 mm l-glutamine 24 h prior to the transfection. Transfections were performed using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 300 pmol of siRNA duplexes were transfected in Opti-MEM with pCMV-hGR wild type or the indicated phosphorylation site derivatives (0.25 μg), along with an equal amount of pCMV-LacZ expression vector as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Four hours post-transfection, an equal volume of phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 20% charcoal stripped-FBS and 4 mm l-glutamine was added to the transfection medium. Cell lysates were typically analyzed 20 h post-transfection. For the proteasome inhibitor treatment, the medium was changed 16 h post-transfection and replaced with phenol red-free DMEM, 10% charcoal stripped-FBS, 2 mm glutamine, and either 2 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) in Me2SO or Me2SO alone. Whole cell lysates were prepared 4 h post-treatment. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were typically lysed directly on the plate in 100 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The whole cell extract was normalized for total protein using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein were fractionated by 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel-fractionated proteins were then transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore) and probed with an anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), anti-TSG101 mouse monoclonal antibody (A410, Abcam), anti-β-galactosidase rabbit polyclonal antibody (CR7001RP1, Cortex Biochem), and an anti-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody (TU27, Covance). GR phosphorylation site-specific antisera to Ser(P)-203 and Ser(P)-211 as well as the antibody N499 to total GR have been described previously (7Wang Z. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar). The blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies and the ECL substrate as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The same membrane was used for each experiment. After probing with a particular antibody, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS at 50 °C for 10 min twice, blocked for 2 h, and reprobed with the next antibody. Quantitative analysis of immunoblots was performed using the NIH Image software package (version 1.62). TSG101 Interacts Preferentially with the Non-phosphorylated Form of GR—TSG101 was previously identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as an interacting cofactor with the wild type GR AF-1, a region that contains two of the major hormone-dependent phosphorylation sites in GR (8Krstic M.D. Rogatsky I. Yamamoto K.R. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3947-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 6: 951-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we investigated whether GR phosphorylation affects its interaction with TSG101. To test this, a GR with the hormone-dependent phosphorylation sites Ser-203 and Ser-211 converted to alanine, thereby mimicking the non-phosphorylated state of the receptor, was tested for interaction with TSG101 using the yeast two-hybrid system. It has been demonstrated previously that the same residues on GR are phosphorylated in both yeast and mammalian cells (37Pocuca N. Ruzdijic S. Demonacos C. Kanazir D. Krstic-Demonacos M. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 66: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown previously, TSG101 interacts strongly with the wild type GR and shows reduced affinity for the receptor mutant 30IIB, which harbors three point mutations in AF-1 (15Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast, GR S203A and S211A increase interaction with TSG101 as compared with wild type GR (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis demonstrates that this enhanced interaction is not because of differences in receptor expression between the wild type and the mutant GR derivatives (Fig. 1B). Therefore, TSG101 interacts with the wild type GR and more favorably with the hypophosphorylated form of GR. Expression and Phosphorylation of Endogenous and Transfected GR in HeLa Cells—Studies from our and other laboratories suggest that GR phosphorylation in mammalian cells is heterogeneous (9Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 38Bodwell J.E. Webster J.C. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Hu J.M. Munck A. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To examine the heterogeneity of receptor phosphorylation in HeLa cells, we first determined the phosphorylation of endogenous GR using GR phosphorylation site-specific antisera. In agreement with our previous studies on GR phosphorylation in U2OS-hGR, A459 cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (7Wang Z. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), GR displayed a significant basal level of phosphorylation at Ser-203 but not at Ser-211, and the phosphorylation of Ser-211, and to a lesser extent Ser-203, increased with dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 2A). Next, to examine the amount of non-phosphorylated GR, lysates from HeLa cells were depleted of the GR phospho-203 isoform using the Ser(P)-203 antibody linked to protein A beads. The bound material as well as the unbound fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting with GR phospho-specific antisera and with an antibody that recognizes GR independent of its phosphorylation state as a measure of total GR. We found that the Ser(P)-203-bound fraction showed strong immunoreactivity to total GR, Ser(P)-203, and to a lesser extent Ser(P)-211 antibodies, which resembles the pattern observed with whole cell lysates (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in the unbound fraction, GR was detectable only with an antibody against total GR, and is not recognized by the phospho-specific Ser(P)-203 and Ser(P)-211 antisera above background levels (Fig. 2C), even with extended exposures of the immunoblot (not shown), suggesting that a small fraction of GR molecules in HeLa cells are not phosphorylated at either at Ser-203 or Ser-211. It is noteworthy that TSG101 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous GR from HeLa cells (Fig. 2B) and was also present in the unbound fraction with the unphosphorylated GR (Fig. 2C). Unfortunately, the lack of an antibody that recognizes exclusively the non-phosphorylated, rather than total GR precludes direct analysis of this interesting receptor pool. We also do not yet have a method to enrich the endogenous non-phosphorylated GR in vivo through pharmacological manipulation such as kinase inhibitors or phosphatase activators. Therefore, we have elected to use the GR S203A/S211A mutation as a mimetic for non-phosphorylated GR in our subsequent experiments. To further ensure that this GR phosphorylation site mutant reflects the non-phosphorylated state, wild type GR or GR S203A/S211A derivatives were expressed in HeLa cells in the absence of hormone and immunoprecipitated from lysates using the common HA-epitope resident on each protein (Fig. 2D). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with HA and the GR phospho-specific antisera. As expected, Ser(P)-203 antibody recognized the wild type GR but did not recognize the GR S203A/S211A mutant, despite the fact that the HA antibody immunoprecipitated an equivalent amount of GR from each derivative (Fig. 2D). The immunoprecipitation results confirm that the GR S203A/S211A mutation is characteristic of the non-phosphorylated form of the receptor. TSG101 Overexpression Stabilizes the Hypophosphorylated Form of GR—TSG101 represses the hormone-dependent GR transcriptional activity under conditions when GR is hyperphosphorylated (9Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Given that TSG101 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm (22Xie W. Li L. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and appears to associate more avidly with the GR serine-to-alanine mutant that mimics the hypophosphorylated form of the receptor (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that TSG101 might also affect GR in the cytoplasm and regulate receptor steady state levels, as has been shown for other TSG101-interacting proteins such as MDM2 and p21 (25Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 40Oh H. Mammucari C. Nenci A. Cabodi S. Cohen S.N. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5430-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). GR has been previously shown to undergo ligand-dependent down-regulation to limit the hormone response (11Wallace A.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42714-42721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that preserve the level of the unliganded GR protein are not well understood. To assess the effect of TSG101 on GR protein levels, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for an HA-tagged wild type human GR (CMV-GR wt), or its phosphorylation-deficient or mimetic derivatives (CMV-GR S203A/S211A or CMV-GR S203E/S211E), along with either an untagged version of TSG101 or an empty expression vector. Cells also received a β-galactosidase expression vector (CMV-LacZ) as an internal control for transfection efficiency, to normalize GR protein levels to that of β-galactosidase. Cells were treated with vehicle or with 100 nm dexamethasone, and the steady state levels of GR and β-galactosidase were determined by immunoblot analysis. Both GR wild type (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3) and GR S203E/S211E (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 11) protein levels are comparable in the absence or in the presence of TSG101 overexpression and display the characteristic GR down-regulation in the presence of dexamethasone. In contrast, GR S203A/S211A shows a significant increase in the steady state GR protein level when TSG101 is overexpressed, most notably in the absence of ligand (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 7). We quantitated the amount of GR protein relative to the β-galactosidase control in the absence of hormone from four independent experiments. Little change in protein levels is noted for the wild type GR, the double phospho-mimetic mutant GR S203E/S211E or the single GR S211A substitution regardless of TSG101 level, whereas a small increase in steady state level was observed for the GR S203A mutant in the presence of overexpressed TSG101 (F"

Recent studies have demonstrated that the interaction of SRF with the co-activator myocardin is a critical determinant of smooth muscle development. It has been proposed that the specific transcriptional activation of smooth muscle-restricted genes (as opposed to other SRF-dependent genes) by myocardin results from the presence of multiple CArG boxes in smooth muscle genes that facilitate myocardin homodimer formation. This proposal was further tested in the current study. Our results show that the SMC-specific telokin promoter, which contains only a single CArG box, is strongly activated by myocardin. Furthermore, myocardin and a dimerization defective mutant myocardin induce expression of endogenous telokin but not c-fos in 10T1/2 fibroblast cells. Knocking down myocardin by small interfering RNA decreased telokin promoter activity and expression in A10 SMCs. A series of telokin and c-fos promoter chimeric and mutant reporter genes was generated to determine the mechanisms responsible for the promoter-specific effects of myocardin. Data from these experiments demonstrated that the ets binding site in the c-fos promoter partially blocks the activation of this promoter by myocardin. However, the binding of ets factors alone was not sufficient to explain the promoter-specific effects of myocardin. Elements 3′ of the CArG box in the c-fos promoter act in concert with the ets binding site to block the ability of myocardin to activate the promoter. Conversely, elements 5′ and 3′ of the CArG box in the telokin promoter act in concert with the CArG box to facilitate myocardin stimulation of the promoter. Together these data suggest that the promoter specificity of myocardin is dependent on complex combinatorial interactions of multiple cis elements and their trans binding factors.

There is extensive evidence showing that altered control of the differentiated state of smooth muscle cells contributes to the development and/or progression of a variety of diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and asthma. These diseases are all associated with decreased expression of proteins required for the differentiated function of smooth muscle cells. An understanding of the mechanisms that control smooth muscle cell differentiation is required before it will be possible to determine how these control processes are altered in pathological conditions.Recent studies have demonstrated that the interaction of SRF with the co-activator myocardin is a critical determinant of vascular smooth muscle development (1Li S.

Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1345-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of myocardin is, however, selective to cardiac and smooth muscle-specific genes as other SRF-dependent genes such as c-fos are not strongly activated by myocardin (6Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Pipes G.C. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7129-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). A model has been developed to explain this promoter specificity of myocardin (6Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Pipes G.C. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7129-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). According to this model, transcriptional activation of smooth muscle cell-specific genes by myocardin requires at least two CArG boxes to allow formation of myocardin homodimers. In contrast, ubiquitously expressed genes, such as c-fos, that contain a single CArG box close to the transcription initiation site are not activated by myocardin because of their inability to promote myocardin homodimer formation. However, this model does not explain why other growth factor regulated genes such as Egr-1, which contains five CArG boxes, are not activated by myocardin-related transcription factor A or by myocardin (current study) (7Du K.L.

In addition, fragments of the smooth muscle-specific α-actin and myosin proximal promoters that contain two CArG boxes are not sufficient to direct expression of transgenes specifically to smooth muscle cells (9Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 10Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast, the smooth muscle-restricted telokin promoter that contains only a single CArG box has been shown to be sufficient to mediate smooth muscle-specific expression of a transgene in vivo (11Smith A.F. Bigsby R.M. Word R.A. Herring B.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1188-C1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Telokin expression has also been shown to be up-regulated following myocardin infection of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (12Yoshida T. Kawai-Kowase K. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1596-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the promoter-specific effects of myocardin we have compared the ability of myocardin to activate two single CArG box containing genes, the smooth muscle-specific telokin gene, and the widely expressed c-fos gene.Results demonstrate that myocardin and its dimerization-deficient leucine zipper (LZ) mutant is capable of strongly trans-activating single CArG box containing, smooth muscle-specific, telokin promoter and to induce telokin expression in 10T1/2 cells although the myocardin LZ mutant is less effective than the wild type myocardin. In contrast, myocardin had no effect on c-fos promoter activity or c-fos gene expression in 10T1/2 cells. Knocking down endogenous myocardin in SMC cells by siRNA decreased telokin promoter activity and endogenous telokin expression. Analysis of a series of chimeric and mutant telokin and c-fos reporter genes demonstrated that in the c-fos promoter the ets binding site (EBS), which binds ets factors, partially blocks the activation of this promoter by myocardin; however, an additional region between -300 and +39 is required to prevent myocardin activation of the c-fos promoter. Conversely, multiple cis elements in the telokin promoter are required for maximal myocardin activation. We propose that the gene specificity of myocardin is dependent on combinations of multiple positive and negative cis elements and their trans binding factors.MATERIALS AND METHODSMammalian Expression and Reporter Gene Assays—The mouse myocardin pcDNA3.1-myc/his vector was kindly provided by Dr. Eric N. Olson (Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The myocardin LZ mutant was developed by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (6Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Pipes G.C. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7129-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). All promoter reporter genes were constructed by cloning fragments of promoters into the pGL2B luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The mouse and rabbit telokin promoter-luciferase reporter gene used includes nucleotides -190 to +181 (T370) and -256 to +147 (T400), respectively, of the telokin gene as described previously (13Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1656-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SM22α-luciferase reporter gene includes nucleotides -475 to +61 of mouse SM22α (14Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The SM α-actin promoter fragment extended from nucleotide -2,555 to +2,813 (9Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and the SM-myosin heavy chain promoter extended from -4,200 to +11,600 (16Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The Egr-1 and c-fos luciferase reporter genes spanned from -637 to +79 and -605 to +39, respectively. The minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter used comprised nucleotides -113 to +20 of the thymidine kinase gene. All mutant reporter gene constructs were initially generated in pCR pBlunt vector (Invitrogen) the by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and then transferred to pGL2b vector. The resultant plasmids were sequenced to verify the integrity of the insert. Transfection was carried out as described previously (17Zhou J. Hoggatt A.M. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15929-15937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The level of promoter activity was evaluated by measurement of the firefly luciferase relative to the internal control Renilla luciferase using the dual luciferase assay system essentially as described by the manufacturer (Promega). A minimum of six independent transfections was performed and all assays were replicated at least twice. Results are reported as the mean ± S.E.Reverse Transcription Coupled to PCR—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).

The shuttle vector contains the H1 promoter driving the siRNA cassette together with a cytomegalovirus-driven coral GFP cDNA.Adenovirus Construction and Cell Infection—Adenovirus constructs were made using the Adeno-X vectors essentially as the manufacturer (BD Biosciences) instructed and as described previously (17Zhou J. Hoggatt A.M. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15929-15937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus was packaged in HEK293 cells and amplified to obtain high titer stocks. For adenoviral infection A10 cells or 10T1/2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2× 105 cells/well and grown overnight to near confluence. These cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove serum and infected with adenovirus encoding LacZ, myocardin, myocardin LZ mutant, or myocardin siRNA in phosphate-buffered saline for 4 h at 37 °C. These conditions resulted in close to 100% infection of cells. 72 h following infection cell protein extracts were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Western Blotting—Western blotting analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (18Gallagher P.J.

Fifteen micrograms of protein were fractionated on 7.5 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein sample was electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and verified by Ponceau S staining. The membrane was then probed with a series of antibodies.

The effects of myocardin on reporter genes driven by the mouse minimal telokin promoter (-190 to +171, T370), the SM α-actin promoter, SM22α promoter, or the SM myosin heavy chain promoter were examined in 10T1/2 cells. Results from these luciferase assays revealed that the telokin promoter was strongly activated by myocardin, which was similar to other SMC-specific promoters in 10T1/2 cells. In contrast, myocardin only activated the Egr-1 and c-fos promoters 4-fold (Fig. 1, upper panel). Similar activation by myocardin was observed in COS cells; however, myocardin activated the smooth muscle-specific promoters to a far lesser extent in A10 SMCs as compared with 10T1/2 cells or COS cells (Fig. 1, middle and lower panels).Overexpression of Wild Type and LZ Mutant Myocardin Induces Endogenous Telokin but Not c-Fos Expression in 10T1/2 Fibroblast Cells—Wild type and LZ mutant myocardin expression plasmids were transfected into 10T1/2 cells and RT-PCR was carried out on RNA isolated from the transfected cells to determine whether forced expression of wild type and LZ mutant myocardin can induce expression of endogenous telokin. This experiment demonstrated that both myocardin and myocardin LZ mutant were sufficient to drive telokin and SM22α mRNA expression without altering expression of c-fos in 10T1/2 cells. Consistent with these results, adenoviral-mediated expression of wild type or LZ mutant myocardin was also sufficient to induce expression of several smooth muscle proteins including telokin, SM22α, SM α-actin and MLCK in 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). A direct side by side comparison of the effects of the wild type and LZ mutant myocardin demonstrated that much higher levels of expression of the mutant molecule are required to induce smooth muscle-specific gene expression as compared with the wild type myocardin (Fig. 2C). Similarly promoter activation by the LZ mutant myocardin was only ∼20% of that observed with the wild type myocardin (Fig. 2D). Together these data show that although the dimerization deficient myocardin can activate smooth muscle-specific genes its activity is impaired as compared with the wild type myocardin.Fig. 2Effects of wild type and LZ mutant myocardin overexpression on endogenous telokin expression in 10T1/2 cells.A, mouse wild type or LZ mutant myocardin expression vector or empty plasmid pcDNA3.1 was transiently transfected into 10T1/2 cells. 24 h post-transfection total RNA was harvested from cells using TRIzol reagent, and RT-PCR was performed to detect endogenous telokin, SM22α, and c-Fos expression with the SuperScript One-step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping gene served as an internal control showing the equal RNA input and RT-PCR reaction efficiency. B, 10T1/2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates overnight and then transduced with adenovirus encoding LacZ or myocardin as indicated for 4 h. 72 h following infection protein extracts were prepared from infected cells and analyzed by Western blotting to detect expression of endogenous proteins. C, wild type myocardin, myocardin LZ mutant, or control LacZ adenovirus were used to transduce 10T1/2 cells and Western blotting analysis was carried out as described in B. D, myocardin (empty bars), myocardin LZ mutant (hatched bars), or an empty expression vector plasmid were co-transfected together with promoter-luciferase reporter genes containing either the mouse telokin promoter, SM22α, myosin heavy chain, SM α-actin promoter, or a TK promoter-driven Renilla luciferase internal control plasmid into 10T1/2 fibroblast cells. The level of promoter activity was determined by measurement of the firefly luciferase activity relative to the control Renilla luciferase. An arbitrary value of 100 was assigned to the activation of the promoters by myocardin alone. Data presented are mean ± S.E. of six samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)siRNA-mediated Knockdown of Myocardin Decreases Telokin Promoter Activity and Endogenous Telokin Expression in A10 SMCs—To determine the role of endogenous myocardin in regulating SM-specific gene expression endogenous myocardin level was decreased using siRNA. To demonstrate the efficacy of the myocardin siRNA constructs COS cells were co-transfected with myocardin expression plasmids and either control or myocardin siRNA plasmids. Analysis of myocardin levels in extracts from these cells demonstrated that the myocardin siRNA but not control siRNA decreased the exogenous myocardin expression (Fig. 3A). To determine whether down-regulation of myocardin decreased endogenous SMC marker gene expression in SM A10 cells, myocardin siRNA was expressed using an adenovirus in A10 cells and endogenous SMC mRNA and proteins examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). These data demonstrated that endogenous myocardin and telokin but not glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were significantly down-regulated as compared with siRNA control infected and non-infected cells (Fig. 3B). At the protein expression level, 72 h following transduction with myocardin siRNA, telokin, SM22α, and calponin were significantly decreased 20–40%, however, there were no significant changes in the levels of expression of SM α-actin, β-actin, or the 130-kDa MLCK (Fig. 3C). To confirm that telokin promoter activity is myocardin-dependent in SMCs, plasmid-based myocardin siRNA or a scrambled siRNA control pshuttle plasmid was transiently co-transfected into A10 SMCs together with telokin promoter reporter genes, and luciferase activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 3D, the activity of the rabbit telokin promoter but not the thymidine kinase promoter was significantly reduced to ∼40% of control levels in A10 cells transfected with either 300 or 600 ng of myocardin siRNA plasmid.Fig. 3Effects of myocardin siRNA on telokin promoter activity and expression in A10 cells.A, COS cells were co-transfected with plasmid encoding myocardin, myocardin siRNA, or a scrambled siRNA control as indicated. 24 h following transfection protein extracts were prepared from transient transfected cells and analyzed by Western blotting. The level of myocardin siRNA or control siRNA transfection is indicated by GFP expression, which is encoded on the same plasmid construct. B, A10 cells were transduced with adenovirus encoding scrambled siRNA control or myocardin siRNA as indicated. 72 h following infection total RNA was prepared from non-infected or infected cells and analyzed by RT-PCR. The level of siRNA expression is indicated by the expression of GFP, which is encoded on the same virus. C, A10 cells were transduced with adenoviruses as described in B, and then total protein was harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. Protein expression was quantitated by densitometric analysis of the blots and telokin, SM22α and calponin expression were found to be significantly decreased by myocardin siRNA-treated cells (p < 0.05, Student's nonpaired t test). D, rabbit telokin promoter (T400) and minimal thymidine kinase promoter-luciferase constructs were transiently transfected into A10 cells, together with either 300 or 600 ng of myocardin siRNA pshuttle or scramble siRNA control pshuttle plasmids or vector alone, as indicated. 24 h later extracts were prepared for luciferase assays. Luciferase activity was normalized to empty vector transfections.

Reporter genes were generated in which the telokin promoter CArG box was mutated to the c-fos gene CArG box sequence or the SM22α gene CArG near sequence or to a sequence no longer able to bind SRF. These mutant reporter genes were co-transfected together with myocardin, and luciferase activity was determined (Fig. 4A). Mutant telokin promoter reporter genes containing either a c-fos or SM22α CArG box were activated by myocardin similar to the wild type telokin promoter. As expected a mutant telokin promoter that was unable to bind SRF showed no activation by myocardin, showing that the intact CArG is critical for the myocardin activation (Fig. 4A). These data demonstrated that SRF binding to the CArG box is necessary for myocardin activation of the telokin promoter, but the sequence of the CArG box does not explain the ability of myocardin to activate the telokin promoter as opposed to the c-fos promoter.Fig. 4Multiple cis elements in the telokin promoter are involved in the activation by myocardin.A, the mouse telokin promoter CArG box (CCTTTTATGG) was mutated such that it could not bind SRF (CCTTTTCTAG), to c-fos promoter CArG box sequence (CCATATTAGG), or near CArG (CCAAATATGG) from the SM22α gene using the QuikChange site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Reporter genes constructed using these mutant promoters were co-transfected with mouse myocardin or empty expression vector into 10T1/2 cells. The -fold change in promoter activity relative to vector control transfections is presented as mean ± S.E. of six samples. B, truncation mutants of telokin promoter reporter genes together with myocardin or empty vector as a control were transfected into 10T1/2 cells, and luciferase activity was measured 24 h later. The -fold change in promoter activity relative to vector control transfections is presented as mean ± S.E. of six samples. C, the -80 to -66 AT-rich region, -66 to -56 CArG box (CArG), or +36 to +82 regions of the telokin promoter were fused individually or in combination to a minimal TK promoter as indicated. Promoter-luciferase reporter genes were transfected into 10T1/2 cells together with or without myocardin expression vector, and then luciferase activity was determined. The -fold change in promoter activity relative to vector control transfections is presented as mean ± S.E. of six samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To define the minimal regions of the telokin promoter required for myocardin activation, the ability of myocardin to activate a series of deletion constructs was determined (Fig. 4B). Results from this analysis suggest that the regions between -80 and -66 (an AT-rich region) and between +36 to +82 are important for myocardin activation. In contrast, deletion of residues -190 to -80 or +82 to +171 did not alter the ability of myocardin to activate the promoter, suggesting that these regions are not important for this effect. Deletion of the region from +36 to +82 or from -80 to -66 decreased the ability of myocardin to activate the promoter over 10- and 20-fold, respectively. These data demonstrated that the CArG box together with regions from +36 to +82 and -80 to -66 are necessary for myocardin activation of the telokin promoter. To determine whether these regions are sufficient to confer myocardin activation, the telokin CArG box, -66 to -80 region (AT-rich region), and +36 to +82 region were fused to a minimal TK promoter alone or in combination. Each of these regions alone was not sufficient to confer a large amount of myocardin activation (Fig. 4C). Although the CArG element alone increased activation to 11-fold, when all three elements were present the ability of myocardin to activate the minimal TK promoter was increased to 50-fold. These data suggest that multiple cis elements of telokin promoter are necessary and largely sufficient to confer maximal activation by myocardin.The EBS in c-fos Promoter Partially Blocks Myocardin Activation—It has been reported that the SRF binding affinity of the c-fos CArG box is higher than the SM22α CArG boxes, and the variations among CArG boxes of c-fos and SM22α influence cell type specificity of expression (19Chang P.S. Li L. McAnally J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17206-17212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine whether the specific sequence of the c-fos CArG box is important for the lack of response of this promoter to myocardin, the CArG box was mutated to the telokin CArG box sequence or to a sequence unable to bind SRF. Analysis of these mutant reporter genes demonstrated that c-fos promoters containing either the native or telokin CArG box sequence were poorly activated by myocardin (Fig. 5B), and as expected a mutant c-fos promoter that was unable to bind SRF showed no activation by myocardin. These data together with those obtained from the mutant telokin promoters described in Fig. 4A suggest that the precise sequence of the CArG boxes in the c-fos and telokin promoters does not account for the promoter-specific effects of myocardin.Fig. 5Mapping the elements in telokin and c-fos promoters responsible for myocardin selectivity.A, schematic diagram showing the sequences of the CArG box and adjacent 5′-sequence from c-fos and telokin promoters.

One of the best characterized effects of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) is transcriptional activation that regulates selected target genes in the nucleus. Work from several laboratories has documented a Ca2+-dependent interaction between ERα and calmodulin. In addition, we previously showed that antagonism of calmodulin function in cells prevented estradiol from inducing ERα transcriptional activity, suggesting that association of ERα with calmodulin participates in ERα function. In this study we adopted a multifaceted approach to directly address this hypothesis. The calmodulin binding domain on ERα was identified and several mutant ERα constructs unable to bind calmodulin were generated. Elimination of calmodulin binding prevented estradiol from stimulating ERα transcriptional activation. Essentially identical results were obtained when intracellular Ca2+ was chelated with the cell-permeable chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester (BAPTA-AM). Moreover, CaM1234, a calmodulin mutant that is unable to bind Ca2+, functioned as a dominant negative construct. Transfection of cells with CaM1234 reduced estradiol-stimulated ERα transcriptional activity. These data indicate that binding to calmodulin is required for normal transcriptional function of ERα.

Estrogen receptors function as ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate the expression of target genes to affect processes as diverse as reproduction, development, and general metabolism (1.Hall J.M.

It contains an N-terminal region that harbors a ligand-independent transcriptional activation function (AF-1); a core DNA binding domain, containing two highly conserved zinc finger motifs that target the receptor to specific DNA sequences known as estrogen response elements (ERE); a hinge region that permits protein flexibility to allow for simultaneous receptor dimerization and DNA binding; and a large C-terminal region that encompasses the ligand binding domain, dimerization interface, and a ligand-dependent activation function (AF-2) (1.Hall J.M. Couse J.F. Korach K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36869-36872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, ERα undergoes a conformational change that coordinately dissociates corepressors and facilitates recruitment of coactivator proteins to enable transcriptional activation (3.McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interaction screens have revealed a large group of proteins classified as coactivators on the basis of their ability to enhance ERα action when overexpressed in target cells (3.McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins have an important role in ERα action and provide functional and physical links between the receptor and the transcriptional apparatus. The precise roles of most of these proteins remain to be determined.Recent studies have shown that regulation of transcription by nuclear ERα is more complicated than the classical paradigm would predict (reviewed in Refs. 4.Nilsson S.

For example, in some cells both AF-1 and AF-2 are required for maximal transcriptional activities, whereas in others only one is required (7.Meyer M.E. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel M.T.

McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Calmodulin, a ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor protein, appears to participate in ERα transcriptional activity. For example, the cell-permeable calmodulin antagonists CGS9343B and trifluoperizine prevented 17-β-estradiol (E2) from stimulating ERα transcription (9.Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1195-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10.Garcia Pedrero J.M. Del Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol.

Similarly, we documented that E2 failed to enhance transcriptional activity by ERα in cells transiently transfected with a peptide that specifically inhibits calmodulin function in the nucleus (9.Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1195-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, interaction with calmodulin seems to be required for ERα to bind the ERE (11.Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12.Biswas D.K. Reddy P.V. Pickard M. Makkad B. Pettit N. Pardee A.B. J. Biol.

However, the strategies employed in these prior studies were nonspecific or indirect, and recent major reviews continue to ignore the possible role of calmodulin in ERα function (1.Hall J.M.

Therefore, in this work we employed a multifaceted approach to unequivocally document that a direct interaction of ERα with calmodulin is necessary for E2 to stimulate ERα transcriptional activation. We developed a point mutant ERα construct (termed ERαΔCaM) that is unable to bind calmodulin. Despite binding E2 with an affinity 3.5-fold greater than that of wild-type ERα, transcriptional activity of ERαΔCaM was not augmented by E2. Congruent with our prior documentation that ERα binds directly to calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (15.Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), chelation of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) abrogated E2-stimulated transcriptional activation of ERα. Importantly, a point mutant calmodulin that is unable to bind Ca2+ functioned as a dominant negative construct, reducing both basal and E2-stimulated transcriptional activity of ERα. Taken together, these data indicate that calmodulin has an essential role in ERα transcriptional activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Biowhittaker.

All 5′-primers contained a BamH1 site and all 3′-primers contained an ApaI site. Each PCR fragment was digested with BamH1 and ApaI, then inserted into pcDNA3-myc at the same restriction sites.To construct full-length pcDNA3-myc-ERα, a 1.67-kb ERα fragment was cut from pcDNA3-ERα (15.Li Z.

Amino acid residues 298–303, 298–310, and 298–317 were deleted from pcDNA3-myc-ERα using PCR with a C-terminal primer 5′-CATGAGCGGGCTTGGCCAAAG-3′ and the N-terminal primers 5′-AACAGCCTGGCCTTGTCCC-3′, 5′-ACGGCCGACCAGATGGTCAG-3′, and 5′-GCCTTGTTGGATGCTGAGCC-3′, respectively. 7-kilobase fragments were purified from low melting agarose and allowed to self-ligate. The constructs are named ERαΔ298–303, ERαΔ298–310, and ERαΔ298–317, respectively.Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmid pcDNA3-myc-ERα was used as template. The mutant cDNA was amplified with Pfu turbo DNA polymerase using the oligonucleotide 5′-CCAAGCCCGCTCATGGACGAACGCTCTAAGAAGA-3′ (mutated residues are underlined). These changes result in replacement of Ile-298 with Glu and Lys-299 with Asp. The construct is termed ERΔCaM. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—MCF-7 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes for Western blots and quantitative PCR, 96-well plates for measurement of transcription, or 12-well dishes for E2 binding assays. DNA was transiently introduced into cells 24 h after plating using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. When measuring transcriptional activity, transfections were performed in triplicate with 200 ng of total DNA per well, comprising 10 ng of pRL-TK (which encodes Renilla reniformis luciferase, used as an internal control for transfection efficiency), 40 ng of ERE3-TK-Luc reporter, and 150 ng of ERα, mutant ERα, mutant calmodulin (CaM1234) (17.Peterson B.Z.

Six hours after transfection the medium was replaced with phenol red-free medium containing 10% charcoal-treated FBS. Twenty-four hours later, E2 or an equal amount of vehicle was added to the cells. Cells were incubated for the times indicated in the figure legends, lysed, and processed as described as below.Luciferase Reporter Assay—Equal numbers of cells were lysed in 50 μl (for 96-well plates) or 200 μl (for 12-well plates) Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega), essentially as described previously (9.Li L.

Briefly, light emission due to firefly luciferase activity was measured using a 300–650 nm range photomultiplier tube in a Turner Design 20/20 DLReady luminometer for 12 s. Stop & Glo reagent was added to quench the firefly luciferase, and Renilla (control) luciferase activity in the same sample tube was then measured for an additional 12 s. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency to the Renilla luciferase internal control. Where indicated, cells were incubated with E2 or an equal volume of ethanol/dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle). The concentration and incubation times are indicated in the figure legends. Note that the concentration of BAPTA-AM used did not reduce the viability of the cell lines used in this study (data not shown). In addition, E2 did not enhance the signal in cells transfected with the TK-Luc plasmid lacking ERE (data not shown).Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of protein lysate were resolved directly by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat powdered milk in TBS-T buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and probed with anti-ERα, anti-hemagglutinin, or anti-calmodulin antibodies. Complexes were visualized with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).In Vitro Transcription and Translation—[35S]Methionine-labeled ERαs were produced with the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions. As described previously (19.Roy M. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), 1 μg of DNA was mixed with 40 μl of TnT quick master mix and 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), then incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Products were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Calmodulin Binding—In vitro binding assays were performed by incubating 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing [35S]methionine-labeled ERα (wild-type ERα and the ERα mutants indicated in the figure legend) with calmodulin-Sepharose beads in 1 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the presence or absence of 1 mm CaCl2. Sepharose without calmodulin was used as control. After 4 h at 4 °C, beads were washed four times with Buffer A containing 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and [35S]methionine-labeled ERα was detected by autoradiography.pcDNA3 containing the indicated ERα cDNA plasmids, namely ERα-(1–595), ERα-(1–270), ERα-(300–595), ERα-(180–595), ERα-(180–353), ERα-(180–253), ERα-(248–317), or ERα-(180–317) (numbers in parentheses correspond to the amino acid residues of ERα), were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in Buffer A containing 1 mm CaCl2 and sonicated, followed by centrifugation. After preclearing with Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated with 40 μl calmodulin-Sepharose (or Sepharose without calmodulin as control) on a rotator at 4 °C for 4 h. Beads were washed four times with Buffer A containing 1 mm CaCl2 and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.25 m sucrose, and 2 mm EDTA). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and processed by immunoblotting as described above.E2 Binding Assay—A whole cell ligand binding assay was used to measure the estrogen binding capacity of ERα (20.Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10880-10887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells, plated in 24-well culture dishes, were transfected with wild-type or mutant ERα. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with phenol red-free medium for another 24 h, followed by 2 h incubation with 10 nm [3H]estradiol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A 200-fold excess of diethyl-stilbestrol was added to one set of cells to distinguish between specific and nonspecific binding. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and once with phosphate-buffered saline alone. The cells were lysed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium molybdate, 0.4 m KCl, 1 mm monoglycerol, and 2 mm leupeptin, and disrupted by freeze-thawing three times. The amount of bound radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Radioactivity specifically bound to wild-type ERα (150,000 to 300,000 cpm) was 10-fold greater than nonspecific binding. A set of cells processed in parallel was used to verify by Western blotting that cells expressed equivalent levels of ERα.Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on the iCycler IQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) to examine the effect of E2 on the estrogen responsive gene pS2. MCF-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3 or CaM1234, and COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type ERα or ERαΔCaM was incubated with or without E2 as described above. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After quantification in a spectrophotometer, 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA in a total volume of 40 μl using the iScript™cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was used in subsequent RT-PCR reactions, performed in 1× iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) with 5 pmol forward and reverse primers (21.Fan M. Nakshatri H. Nephew K.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2603-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The primers used were, for pS2 hnRNA: forward primer, 5-TTGGAGAAGGAAGCTGGATGG-3 (start position 3997, within the intron); reverse primer, 5-ACCACAATTCTGTCTTTCACGG-3 (start position 4126, within the second exon); and for β-actin: forward primer, 5-TGCGTGACATTAAGGAGAAG-3; and reverse primer, 5-GCTCGTAGCTCTTCTCCA-3. RT-PCR was performed in 96-well optical plates (Bio-Rad) using an iCycler System (Bio-Rad) for 40 cycles (94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 40 s), after an initial 3 min denaturation at 94 °C. Serial dilutions of a cDNA sample prepared from MCF-7 cells or COS-7 cells were used to construct standards curves for the pS2 hnRNA amplifications. In all cases, concurrent analysis was performed with β-actin as an internal control. All samples and standards were run in triplicate. Results were analyzed using the relative standard curve method as described in Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression (Applied Biosystems User Bulletin 2). pS2 results were expressed relative to β-actin as internal control.Miscellaneous—Statistical analysis was performed by Students's t test, using InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined with the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad).RESULTSDevelop ERα Mutants That Do Not Bind to Calmodulin—We previously reported that ERα interacted directly with calmodulin and that antagonism of calmodulin attenuated ERα transcription (9.Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1195-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15.Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the role of calmodulin in ERα function, we set out to develop ERα mutant constructs that would not bind calmodulin. The first step was to identify the calmodulin binding region in ERα. The strategy adopted was to generate radiolabeled fragments of ERα and examine their ability to bind to calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 1). [35S]Methionine-labeled full-length ERα (ERα-1–595) bound to calmodulin-Sepharose (Fig. 1B). Specificity of binding to calmodulin is evident by the absence of an interaction with Sepharose alone. Binding was markedly reduced when Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA (data not shown). Analysis of fragments of ERα revealed that the middle portion of the molecule was required for maximal binding (Fig. 1). Longer exposure of the autoradiogram in Fig. 1B revealed a weak band in the lane containing ERα (1–270) (data not shown), implying a possible low affinity binding site in this region of the molecule. By generating multiple fragments of different sizes, residues 248–317 were observed to be necessary for maximal binding (Fig. 1C). Inspection with a helical wheel projection of the sequence of ERα in this region revealed a predicted calmodulin binding motif between amino acids 298 and 317 (IKRSKKNSLALSLTADQMVS).The effect of deletion of residues 298–317 of ERα on its ability to bind calmodulin was examined next. COS-7 cells were transfected with ERα, and lysates were incubated with calmodulin-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+. Full-length ERα bound to calmodulin (Fig. 2A). Binding to calmodulin was specific as no ERα was detected in samples incubated with Sepharose alone. Deletion of residues 298–317 of ERα eliminated its ability to bind calmodulin (Fig. 2A). Similarly, deletion of smaller portions of ERα, namely amino acids 298–310 and 298–303, abrogated binding to calmodulin. Based on our knowledge of the interaction of calmodulin with target proteins (22.Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4347-4352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Ile-298 and Lys-299 were necessary for the interaction of ERα with calmodulin. Consistent with our prediction, an ERα point mutant in which Ile-298 and Lys-299 were replaced, termed ERαΔCaM, failed to bind to calmodulin (Fig. 2A)Fig. 2Analysis of binding of ERα mutant constructs to calmodulin.A, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone (vector), full-length ERα (WT), or the indicated ERα mutant constructs. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Lysate, upper panel). In addition, equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated with calmodulin-Sepharose (CaM-Sepharose) or Sepharose alone (Seph) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. After pelleting beads, bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF (Pull down). Blots were probed with anti-ERα antibodies. B, [35S]methionine-labeled TNT products of full-length ERα (WT) and the indicated ERα mutant constructs were incubated with calmodulin-Sepharose in the presence or absence of 1 mm CaCl2. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The input lanes contain 10% of the total amount of [35S]methionine-labeled ERα used in the pull-down assay. Data are representative of three independent experimental determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify the findings, calmodulin binding assays were also performed with [35S]methionine-labeled ERα. Wild-type ERα bound to calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+; minimal ERα was detected when Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA (Fig. 2B). As was observed with transfected cells, neither radiolabeled ERαΔ298–317 nor ERαΔCaM was able to bind calmodulin. Note that equal amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled ERα were used (Fig. 2B, input).Comparison of Transcriptional Activities of Wild-type and Mutant ERα—The effects of calmodulin on ERα transcriptional activation were examined by comparing wild-type and mutant ERα in a well characterized assay that measures the activity of an ERα-responsive reporter (9.Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1195-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To eliminate interference from endogenous ERα, we used COS-7 cells that lack ERα. Incubation with E2 enhanced ERα transcriptional activity 5.2-fold in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with wild-type ERα (Fig. 3A). In contrast, transcriptional activity of ERαΔ298–317, which lacks amino acids 298–317, was not significantly stimulated by E2. It is possible that the removal of 20 amino acids may produce a large conformational change in ERα, rendering it transcriptionally inactive. Therefore, analysis was repeated using ERαΔ298–303, which lacks only six amino acids. Although basal transcriptional activity of ERαΔ298–303 was ∼2-fold higher than that of wild-type ERα, E2 was unable to augment transcription (Fig. 3A). Similarly, E2 had no effect on the transcriptional activity of the point mutant construct ERαΔCaM. Absent detailed structural information, it is impossible to completely exclude that the conformation of ERαΔCaM is altered. However, it is most unlikely that changing only two amino acids would sufficiently perturb the tertiary structure to prevent ERα binding to transcription factors. These data confirm that E2 cannot stimulate transcriptional activation of ERα, which lack the ability to bind calmodulin.Fig. 3E2-induced transcriptional activity. COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with ERE3-TK-Luc, pRL-TK, and pcDNA3-ERα (WT) or the indicated ERα mutant constructs. pRL-TK was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Forty-eight hours later, cells were treated with vehicle (EtOH, clear bars) or 10 nm E2 (shaded bars) for 16 h and subsequently assayed for luciferase activity (panel A). In all cases, lysates were prepared from equivalent numbers of cells. Results are expressed relative to cells transfected with wild-type ERα incubated with vehicle alone. *, significantly different (p < 0.05); **, significantly different (p < 0.01); †, not significant (p > 0.05). Data are derived from three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. Means ± S.E. are shown. B, equal amounts of protein lysate from the cells treated as described in A were removed and processed by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to PVDF, blots were probed with anti-ERα antibody and antigen-antibody complexes were identified by ECL. A representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is conceivable that lack of E2 stimulation of transcription of the mutant ERα could be due to altered receptor expression. Therefore, an aliquot of the cell lysate was removed prior to the transcription assay and the amount of ERα was evaluated by Western blotting. Mutant ERα was expressed to the same level among all the samples (Fig. 3B). Consistent with published observations in breast epithelial cells by this group (15.Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and others (23.Berthois Y. Dong X.F. Roux-Dossetto M. Martin P.M. Mol. Cell.

A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), E2 reduced the amount of wild-type ERα in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3B). Interestingly incubation with E2 did not substantially alter the amount of mutant ERα. The mechanism responsible for this finding is not known.E2 Binding—The calmodulin binding region overlaps the proximal portion of the ligand binding domain (see Fig. 1A). It is therefore feasible that the inability of E2 to stimulate transcriptional activation"

Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the JM-TM regions identified three novel constitutively active mutants, demonstrating close disulfide-bonded juxtapositioning of these residues in the JM (L223C) and N-terminal TM domain (L226C, I227C). Chemical cross-linking defined the interface of the active helical TM dimer and revealed that the JM-TM segment encompassing Leu226-Leu230 is non-helical. Molecular dynamics and NMR studies indicated that the TM-JM junction forms an N-terminal helix cap.

Activation of the EpoR by Epo results in the activation of cytosolic Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) tyrosine kinase (4Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Activated JAK2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues on itself, in various signaling molecules and in the EpoR cytoplasmic domain. These EpoR phosphotyrosines become docking sites for several signaling molecules and can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Phosphorylated EpoR recruits and activates STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression (5Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar).The EpoR has a large extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane (TM) helix, and a large cytoplasmic domain. The crystal structure of the extracellular ligand binding domain of the EpoR has been solved in complex with Epo (6Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D.

These structures were dimeric and differed by the relative orientations of the extracellular domains. Receptor dimerization alone is not sufficient for activation as studies with dimerizing antagonists of Epo show that inhibitory dimeric conformations exist (8Livnah O. Johnson D.L. Stura E.A.

In addition, we have recently shown that the relative dimeric orientation of the TM and cytoplasmic domains is also important for activation (10Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol.

The unliganded EpoR is assumed to adopt a different conformation from the ligand-activated receptor, but both orientations are thought to be stabilized by interactions between the EpoR TM domains (12Constantinescu S.N.

These 22 mostly hydrophobic residues are sufficient to span the cell membrane. The TM region must adopt helical secondary structure in order to satisfy backbone hydrogen bonds within the hydrophobic membrane interior. The juxtamembrane sequence on the cytosolic side of the EpoR appears to be α-helical and contains within its first eleven amino acids a hydrophobic motif (Leu253, Ile257, Trp258), which is required for JAK2 activation (10Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This motif is conformationally rigid, and its orientation is dictated by the register of the EpoR TM domain. Precise orientation of this motif is important for optimal signaling not only for the EpoR, but also for the gp130 subunit of the interleukin 6 receptor family (14Greiser J.S. Stross C. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Hermanns H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26959-26965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In contrast, there are no data on the juxtamembrane region on the extracellular side of the membrane. It is not known where the transition between the extracellular domain and the TM α-helix occurs or whether this transition has a rigid structure. In this report, we define where that transition takes place by using several complementary approaches: single cysteine scanning mutagenesis and cross-linking, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. We show that three cysteine mutants in this region (L223C, L226C, I227C) result in constitutive activation of the receptor, we define the interface between the TM domains of an activated EpoR dimer, and we show that the junction between the JM and TM domains is not helical and its sequence is important for proper receptor function. 2During the submission of this manuscript we became aware of an independent study by Xiaohui Lu and Harvey F. Lodish where the cysteine mutations at positions 223, 226, and 227 as well as other mutations in the transmembrane domain of the EpoR were isolated by random mutagenesis and selection for constitutive EpoR activation.2During the submission of this manuscript we became aware of an independent study by Xiaohui Lu and Harvey F.

In the wild-type HA-tagged murine EpoR cDNA Cys180 and Cys289 were mutated to Ser and Ala, respectively. By introducing a stop codon after amino acid 355 a thiol-free receptor backbone was created into which all single amino acid substitutions were cloned. cDNAs coding for the 28 single cysteine mutations in the EpoR juxtamembrane and transmembrane domains (A220C-L247C) as well as the Leu6 and Leu9 mutations were generated by overlap extension PCR with synthetic oligonucleotides. All constructs were verified by sequencing.Cell Culture—Six-well plates of 293-derived human Bosc cells (16Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected (Profection, Promega) with cDNAs encoding for the empty plasmid, wild-type EpoR, or mutant receptors in the bicistronic vector pMX-IRES-GFP as described (15Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for cross-linking experiments. To obtain BaF3 cell lines stably expressing the mutant receptors, retroviral supernatants were generated by co-transfection of the Bosc packaging cell line with receptor DNA and the ecotropic vector pCL eco (17Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5 × 105 BaF3 cells were centrifuged for 120 min at 37 °C and 900 × g in the presence of 16 μg of Polybrene and 750 μl of virus supernatant. After 48 h the transfection efficiency was evaluated by analysis of GFP expression.Surface Expression of HA-EpoR—Surface expression of N-terminally HA-tagged EpoR was measured in BaF3 cells by flow cytometry using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Covance, 10 μg/ml) and R-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated donkey F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (12.5 μg/ml), as described (18Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Cross-linking Studies on Live Cells—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2. If cysteines of interest were in the TM domain, extracellular cysteines were blocked by incubation with 100 μmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 30 min at room temperature. NEM was removed by spinning the cells and aspiration of the supernatant. Cross-linking was then performed for 10 min at room temperature with a final concentration of the cross-linker 1,2-dimaleimidylphenylene (o-PDM) dissolved in Me2SO of 100 μm. Cells were lysed with 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer in the presence of 2% β-mercaptoethanol to quench excess cross-linker. Lysate samples were separated on 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with EpoR antibody directed against the receptor N terminus (UBI) at a dilution of 1:1000, respectively, followed by incubation with protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:10,000 and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Actin was detected by using a monoclonal actin antibody (Sigma) and incubation with a mouse-horseradish peroxidase antibody. For non-reducing gels, cells were lysed as described. Non-reducing Laemmli buffer was added to the lysates, and the proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis without prior boiling.Assay for Growth Factor-independent Proliferation—Parental BaF3 cells and BaF3 cells expressing the wild-type EpoR, or the various constructs growing in IL-3 were washed extensively in RPMI medium, then placed in a 24-well plate with RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum without cytokines. Cell numbers were counted using a Coulter Counter after 1–10 days.Dual Luciferase Assays—Functional STAT5 activation was assessed by measuring luciferase production of Bosc cells transfected with the pLHRE-Luc (lactogenic hormone responsive element), which contains six copies of the prolactin STAT5 binding site in the rat β-casein promoter (19Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As an internal control the pRL-TK vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was used. Bosc cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 50 ng of EpoR cDNA and 10 ng of the reporter cDNA using the Lipofectamine transfectant. After 12 h, cells were stimulated with 100 units/ml Epo. Four hours after transfection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega).Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Two peptides corresponding to the Epo receptor transmembrane domain (Asp-Leu-Asp-Pro-Leu-Ile-Leu7-Thr-Leu9-Ser-Leu-Ile-Leu-Val-Leu-Ile-Ser-Leu-Leu-Leu-Thr-Val-Leu-Ala-Leu-Leu-Ser-His-Arg-Arg) were synthesized on an ABI 430A solid-phase peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using t-BOC-chemistry. [1-13C]Leucine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) was incorporated at either Leu7 or Leu9 of the TM peptide sequence. Leu7 and Leu9 correspond to Leu228 and Leu230 of the murine EpoR sequence, respectively. The N and C termini were protected. The crude peptide (5–15 mg) was purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a C4 column using gradient elution containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The three-gradient elution starts with a largely aqueous solution of 70% distilled water, 12% acetonitrile, and 18% 2-propyl alcohol, and is changed to a more hydrophobic composition of 40% acetonitrile and 55% 2-propyl alcohol that elutes the peptides. The elution was monitored by the optical absorbance at 220 nm. The purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry.Epo receptor transmembrane peptides were reconstituted into DMPC (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine) bilayers at a 50:1 lipid-to-peptide ratio. Purified EpoR peptides were reconstituted by detergent dialysis by first dissolving DMPC, lyophilized peptide, and detergent (octyl-β-glucoside) in trifluoroethanol. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for over 2 h, then trifluoroethanol was removed by evaporation using a stream of argon gas and then placing the sample under vacuum. The dry mixture was rehydrated with phosphate buffer (10 mm phosphate and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7), so that the final concentration of octyl-β-glucoside was 5% (w/v). The rehydrated sample was stirred slowly for at least 6 h, and octyl-β-glucoside was removed by dialysis using Spectra-Por dialysis tubing (3500 MW cutoff) for 24 h against phosphate buffer at 30 °C. The membrane-reconstituted peptides adopted helical transmembrane orientations as assessed by polarized IR spectroscopy. The reconstituted membranes were then pelleted to form multilamellar dispersions and loaded into NMR rotors. Excess water was removed by spinning the sample in a tabletop rotor spinning unit.Magic Angle Spinning NMR Spectroscopy—Solid-state MAS NMR measurements were performed on an Avance 360 MHz spectrometer using a 4-mm double resonance probe (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA). 13C spectra were acquired with ramped amplitude cross-polarization (20Metz G. Wu X. Smith S.O. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 110: 219-227Crossref Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) and TPPM proton decoupling (21Bennett A.E. Rienstra C.M. Auger M. Lakshmi K.V. Griffin R.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 6951-6958Crossref Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). The 1H pulse length was 3.6 μs. The total contact time for cross polarization was 2 ms, and the recycle delay was 2 s. The proton decoupling field strength was 86 kHz. The 13C frequencies were referenced to the carbonyl resonance of solid glycine at 176.02 ppm from TMS. The MAS frequency was 10 kHz ± 3 Hz and the temperature was maintained at –30 °C. The spectra represent the average of ∼60,000 scans and were processed without line broadening.13C line shapes were analyzed using the deconvolution module of Xedplot (Bruker, Billerica, MA). The carbonyl peak was fit with three Gaussian line shapes, two accounting for the natural abundance 13C and peptide background and one for the 13C label in the peptide.Molecular Dynamics Simulations—Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the same approach and force field that we previously employed to successfully predict the conformation of a miniprotein (22Simmerling C. Strockbine B. Roitberg A.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11258-11259Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). All simulations were unrestrained and initiated with a fully extended initial conformation built by the LEaP module of AMBER (version 7, Ref. 23Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.A. Cheatham T.E.

Solvation effects were incorporated using the Generalized Born model, as implemented in AMBER (24Still W.C. Tempczyk A. Hawley R.C. Hendrickson T. J. Am. Chem.

Koshland D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 27Lee G.F. Burrows G.G. Lebert M.R. Dutton D.P. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Biol.

This approach has been shown to be especially useful in the case of TM segments, where structural data are not easily obtained.Introduction of cysteine residues at sequential positions allows characterization of interfaces, either by detection of spontaneously formed disulfide bonds or by chemical cross-linking. Formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds may lead to constitutively active receptors. An example is the EpoR R129C mutant, where replacement of an extracellular arginine with a cysteine leads to disulfide bond formation and constitutive activation (29Yoshimura A. Longmore G. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1990; 348: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 30Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar).We constructed an HA-tagged EpoR in the retroviral pMX-IRES-GFP vector, containing only the four conserved cysteine residues of the EpoR extracellular domain, that are indispensable for protein folding and ligand binding (Fig. 1a). These cysteines are thought to form two intramolecular disulfide bonds between residues Cys28 and Cys38 and Cys66 and Cys82, respectively (30Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A fifth cysteine residue in the extracellular domain, Cys180, was replaced by the related amino acid serine. In the intracellular sequence, Cys289 was mutated to alanine and the cytoplasmic tail was truncated by introduction of a stop codon after Pro355. As a result, this truncated receptor, trEpoR4Cys, does not contain cysteines that should be available for sulfhydryl cross-linking, but includes Tyr343, that is known to be one of the two STAT5 binding sites (31Klingmuller U.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3156-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Into this thiol-free background, as well as into the wild-type EpoR, single amino acid substitutions to cysteine were introduced consecutively from Ala220 to Leu247 (Fig. 1, a and b).Transiently transfected human 293-derived Bosc cells were tested for expression of the receptor mutants. Immunoblotting of cell lysates with an EpoR antibody revealed that all receptors were expressed equally well with the expected size of 41 kDa for truncated receptors (Fig. 3b) and 68 kDa for full-length receptors, respectively, and were able to respond to Epo by activation of STAT5, as verified by luciferase assays (data not shown).Fig. 3Expression of receptor mutants.a, detection of EpoR dimers under non-reducing conditions. Bosc cells were transfected with DNA coding for the empty vector, trEpoR4Cys or the various single cysteine mutant receptors (trA220C-trL247C), lysed, and run on a 10% Tricine gel before immunoblotting with an EpoR antibody. Arrows indicate the size of the monomer and the dimeric proteins. Formation of unspecific intermolecular disulfide bonds to the four extracellular cysteines are marked by a bracket and can be distinguished from transmembrane domain disulfide bond formation by a difference in size (90 versus 100 kDa, respectively). b, for control of expression levels by Western blotting, lysates were prepared as described and run on a 10% Tricine gel under reducing conditions before immunoblotting with an EpoR antibody to detect EpoR monomers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cysteine Scanning of the Juxtamembrane Sequence and Identification of Constitutively Active Receptors—The mutant receptors were then examined for the induction of biologic effects in murine BaF3 cells. This proB cell line requires IL3 for survival and proliferation but can be rendered Epo-dependent upon transduction of the EpoR (33Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: p727-p734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Retroviral supernatants were prepared as described previously (3Constantinescu S.N. Ghaffari S. Lodish H.F.

Stable cell lines expressing the mutant receptors were established and tested for infection efficiency, i.e. GFP expression, and expression of the receptors at the cell surface by HA staining and subsequent FACS analysis. For all receptors the ratio between receptors expressed at the cell surface and the infection efficiency, as determined by GFP expression, was at levels comparable to the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2c).Fig. 2Proliferation studies of BaF3 cells.a, kinetics of cell proliferation in growth factor-depleted medium ± S.D. BaF3 cells expressing wild-type EpoR, and full-length L223C, L226C, I227C, and R129C were selected for autonomous growth and then cultivated in the absence of ligand at the timescale indicated.

As a control, the mutant EpoR R129C was used, which is known to allow factor-independent cell growth (29Yoshimura A. Longmore G. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1990; 348: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 30Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Of the 28 cysteine mutants introduced into the wild-type receptor, only L223C, L226C, and I227C were able to grow in the absence of IL3 or Epo. Fig. 2a shows that the kinetics of ligand-independent growth after selection of cells for 1 week without growth factor is the same for R129C-expressing cells and cells harboring a mutation at L223C, L226C, or I227C. The selection for constitutive activation can be detected as an enrichment for the percentage of cells that express GFP (Fig. 2b).The constitutive activity of EpoR L223C, L226C, and L227C is likely caused by formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds that fix the EpoR in a conformation that is productive for signaling. To test this hypothesis we assayed their migration in non-reducing (Fig. 3a) and reducing (Fig. 3b) Tricine gels and by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3a, strong and equivalent disulfide bonds were formed by A220C to D224C and L226C mutants. P225C, I227C, and L228C formed disulfide bonds with reduced efficiency. None of the other mutants from T229C to L247C formed dimers. Thus, there is no correlation between disulfide bond formation and activity, as the adopted conformation of inactive dimers may not be productive for signaling. This was also observed in studies involving the Neu (Erb-2) receptor, where only a subset of the receptors showing constitutive dimerization because of an engineered cysteine mutation had transforming activity (35Burke C.L. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5371-5379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In non-reducing Tricine gels, besides the 100-kDa complex which was detected for trL223C, trL226C, and trI227C, an additional 90-kDa double band was observed for all receptors including the negative control trEpoR4Cys. This double band corresponds to receptor dimers formed via the four extracellular cysteines in the unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of the receptor (see below and Fig. 4c). Indeed, under non-reducing conditions, these conserved cysteines are able to participate in the formation of higher oligomeric complexes of unknown stoichiometry (36Miura O. Ihle J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 100-kDa complex detected for the trL223C, trL226C and trI227C mutants is a specific product of receptors whose TM helices are in close proximity (app. 3 Å). The differences in apparent molecular weight between the EpoR mutants and the wild-type receptor are presumably caused by differences in the shape of the cross-linked dimer and depend on the location of disulfide bond formation. In this regard, the trR129C mutant can be detected under non-reducing conditions as an ∼95 kDa dimer (data not shown). Addition of β-mercaptoethanol to the samples reduced all oligomeric complexes to the monomeric forms that appear as one single band under the experimental conditions used (Fig. 3b).Fig. 4Cross-linking studies on live cells.a, Bosc cells were transfected with DNA coding for the empty vector, trEpoR4Cys or the various single cysteine mutant receptors of the EpoR TM domain. Free cysteines were blocked by addition of NEM (100 μm) and receptors were then cross-linked with membrane-permeable o-PDM (100 μm), lysed, and separated on a 10% reducing Tricine gel.

Electronic spectroscopy revealed the presence of Co(II) ligand field transitions that had molar absorptivities of ∼100 m–1 cm–1, which suggests that Co(II) is five-coordinate in Co(II)-substituted VanX. Low temperature EPR spectra of Co(II)-substituted VanX were simulated using spin Hamiltonian parameters of M = |±½〉, E/D = 0.14, greal(x,y) = 2.37, and grealS(z) = 2.03. These parameters lead to the prediction that Co(II) in the enzyme is five-coordinate and that there may be at least one solvent-derived ligand. Single scattering fits of EXAFS data indicate that the metal ions in both native Zn(II)-containing and Co(II)-substituted VanX have the same coordination number and that the metal ions are coordinated by 5 nitrogen/oxygen ligands at ∼ 2.0 Å. These data demonstrate that Co(II) (and Zn(II) from EXAFS studies) is five-coordinate in VanX in contrast to previous crystallographic studies (Bussiere, D. E., Pratt, S. D., Katz, L., Severin, J. M., Holzman, T., and Park, C. H. (1998) Mol. Cell 2, 75–84). These spectroscopic studies also demonstrate that the metal ion in Co(II)-substituted VanX when complexed with a phosphinate analog of substrate d-Ala-d-Ala is also five-coordinate.

Vancomycin is a cup-shaped glycopeptide that has been called the “antibiotic of last resort” (1Bussiere D.E. Pratt S.D. Katz L. Severin J.M. Holzman T. Park C.H. Mol.

Science. 1999; 284: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) because it is often used for antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and in patients who are allergic to penicillins. Vancomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the d-Ala-d-Ala end of the peptidoglycan pentapeptide via five hydrogen bonds, thereby preventing cross-linking of the cell wall precursors (3Walsh C.T.

However, bacterial resistance to vancomycin in human pathogens has emerged, particularly in Enterococcus and Staphylococcus strains (3Walsh C.T.

The genes responsible for inducible, high level vancomycin resistance are carried on a 10-kb transposon, which can be converted into self-transferable plasmids and transferred by conjugation (7Arthur M.

Biol. 1996; 3: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). VanR and VanS make up a two-component, signal transduction system that regulates the expression of the other three genes and appears to be stimulated by the presence of vancomycin (8Holman T.R. Wu Z.

VanA is a ligase that uses the d-lactate produced by VanH and generates a d-Ala-d-lactate depsipeptide (11Bugg T.D.H. Wright G.D. Dutka-Malen S. Arthur M. Courvalin P. Walsh C.T.

This depsipeptide is added to a sugar-linked tripeptide by MurF, producing a modified bacterial cell wall precursor that can be incorporated into the growing peptidoglycan layer by the normal bacterial enzymes (3Walsh C.T.

Vancomycin binds to this modified cell wall pentapeptide 103 less tightly than to the normal pentapeptide due to the loss of one hydrogen bond and to a key electrostatic repulsion (11Bugg T.D.H.

The mutagenesis study also implicated Arg-71 and Glu-181 as having roles in catalysis, and these residues were shown in the crystal structure to be close to the Zn(II) ion. The crystal structure also revealed that VanX crystallized as a homohexamer, and each subunit bound one Zn(II). The Zn(II) ion was coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral arrangement with the side chains of His-116, His-184, and Asp-123 and a solvent water as ligands (Fig. 1). The crystal structure also demonstrated a narrow cavity leading to the active site (1Bussiere D.E. Pratt S.D. Katz L. Severin J.M. Holzman T. Park C.H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which nicely explained the very narrow substrate specificity of VanX. Since VanX is essential for vancomycin resistance in bacteria, the enzyme has been targeted for drug/inhibitor design studies in hopes that an inhibitor can be given in combination with vancomycin as a treatment for vancomycin-resistant bacterial infections. Phosphinate and phosphonate analogs of d-Ala-d-Ala have been shown to be inhibitors of VanX, suggesting that the enzyme utilizes a nucleophile-driven hydrolysis reaction that may proceed via a tetrahedral transition state intermediate (17Wu Z. Wright G.D. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Yang K.W. Brandt J.J. Chatwood L.L. Crowder M.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

However, these structurally similar compounds exhibit Ki values varying over several orders of magnitude, and the crystal structure of VanX complexed with a phosphonate and a phosphinate demonstrated two distinct binding interactions (1Bussiere D.E. Pratt S.D. Katz L. Severin J.M. Holzman T. Park C.H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Wu and Walsh (24Wu Z. Walsh C.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1785-1786Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported several dithiol compounds that exhibited potent, time-dependent inhibition of VanX, and Araoz et al. (25Araoz R. Anhalt E. Rene L. Badet-Denisot M.A. Courvalin P. Badet B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15971-15979Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported that a modified d-Ala-d-Gly dipeptide is a mechanism-based inactivator of VanX. The former compounds apparently inhibit VanX by chelating Zn(II) and blocking access of the substrate. The latter compound, upon hydrolysis by VanX, releases a reactive 4-thioquinonefluoromethide that reacts with a group on the surface of the enzyme. Unfortunately none of the reported inhibitors bind tightly enough or are specific enough to be useful as clinical inhibitors. One of the major obstacles in studying VanX is the lack of a direct activity assay. The inability to find chromogenic substrates for VanX is presumably due to the narrow binding cavity in the enzyme that leads up to the active site. The lack of a direct activity assay complicates mechanistic studies, results from which could drive rational inhibitor design or redesign efforts. A ninhydrin-based assay, a capillary electrophoresis procedure, and several coupled assays have been reported (17Wu Z. Wright G.D. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Araoz R. Anhalt E. Rene L. Badet-Denisot M.A. Courvalin P. Badet B.

Anissimova M. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2002; : 3573-3579Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar); however, all of these have experimental problems that limit their use in mechanistic studies. As an alternative, we propose to follow the mechanism by preparing the Co(II)-substituted form of VanX and probing the spectroscopic properties of the metal center during the catalytic cycle with use of stopped-flow and rapid freeze quench coupled with spectroscopic studies. This work describes the preparation of Co(II)-VanX and the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of the resulting enzyme. Preparation of Co(II)-substituted Maltose-binding Protein-VanX and VanX—Co(II)-substituted maltose-binding protein (MBP) 1The abbreviations used are: MBP, maltose-binding protein; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; ICP-AES, inductively coupled plasma with atomic emission spectroscopy.-VanX and VanX were prepared in minimal medium. The minimal medium contained 2.5 g/liter d-(+)-glucose, 5 g/liter casamino acids, 10.8 g/liter K2HPO4, 5.5 g/liter KH2PO4, 10 g/liter NaCl, 1 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 2 mg/liter thiamine, 1 mg/liter biotin, and a 1 ml/liter concentration of a metal mixture containing 124 mg/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 74 μg/ml CaCl2·2H2O, 20 μg/ml MnCl2·4H2O, 31 μg/ml H3BO3, 1.2 μg/ml (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, and 1.6 μg/ml CuSO4 (28Rajagopalan P.T. Grimme S. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In early preparations the buffered medium was adjusted to pH 7.5 following a previously reported protocol (28Rajagopalan P.T. Grimme S. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but in later preparations, the medium was adjusted to pH 6.8 to increase the yields of Co(II)-VanX. Plasmid pIADL14, containing the gene that encodes for a MBP-VanX fusion protein (MBP-VanX), was a gift from Professor Christopher Walsh at Harvard Medical School (18McCafferty D.G. Lessard I.A.D. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10498-10505Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells, and colonies containing the plasmid were selected on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin. A single colony from this plate was used to make an overnight preculture in minimal medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Three 1-liter flasks, each containing 333 ml of minimal medium and 25 μg/ml kanamycin, were inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight preculture and were allowed to grow to an A600 nm of 1.6–1.8 at 30 °C. Protein production was induced by making the cultures 1 mm in isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. At induction, the cultures were also made 100 μm in CoCl2. The cells were then collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 8,275 × g, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C overnight. The cell pellets were thawed on ice and were resuspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 200 mm NaCl. Cells were lysed by passing the resuspension two times through a French press at 16,000 p.s.i., and the cellular debris were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 32,583 × g. The cell lysate was then loaded on a 60-ml amylose column (26 mm × 20 cm), and protein was eluted with a 0–10 mm maltose gradient over 300 ml in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 200 mm NaCl. Fractions containing MBP-VanX were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and pure fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼10 ml with an Amicon ultrafiltration concentrator equipped with a YM-10 membrane. This overexpression/purification protocol resulted in 40 mg of MBP-VanX fusion protein/liter of growth culture. The maltose-binding protein from the fusion MBP-VanX protein was removed by thrombin digestion. Three units of restriction grade thrombin were added for every 1 mg of uncleaved MBP-VanX, and the cleavage was allowed to incubate for 10 h in a water bath at 25 °C. The cleaved proteins were then separated by two methods: a 120-ml Sephacryl S-200 HR size exclusion column (16 mm × 60 cm) or a 25-ml Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (16 mm × 20 cm). Fractions containing purified, cleaved VanX, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration concentrator equipped with a YM-10 membrane. VanX concentrations were determined by using the sample's absorbance at 280 nm, the extinction coefficient (ϵ280 nm), and Beer's Law. The extinction coefficients of MBP-VanX (ϵ280 nm = 115,700 m–1 cm–1) and VanX (ϵ280 nm = 51,200 m–1 cm–1) were determined with amino acid analyses performed at the Protein Separation and Analysis Laboratory in the Department of Biochemistry at Purdue University. Steady-state Kinetic Studies—Steady-state kinetics were performed using a coupled assay developed for VanX by Badet and co-workers (25Araoz R. Anhalt E. Rene L. Badet-Denisot M.A. Courvalin P. Badet B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15971-15979Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This assay involves the use of other enzymes, such as d-lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), catalase (Sigma), and d-amino-acid oxidase (Calzyme Laboratories). All enzymes other than VanX were kept in excess so the rate-limiting process in the coupled reactions is the formation of d-Ala by VanX. All reactions were conducted at 37 °C on an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Concentrations of reagents used in the coupled assay were as follows: VanX at 1–5 nm, d-lactate dehydrogenase at 57 units/ml, catalase at 520 units/ml, d-amino-acid oxidase at 1.2 units/ml, NADH at 10 mm, and d-Ala-d-Ala was varied from 50 μm to 2 mm with all solutions being made in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl. The reactions were monitored at 340 nm, and the reactions were designed to ensure the loss of ∼1 absorbance unit over the course of 10 min. Absorbance values for the linear portion of the curves were converted into velocities using the molar extinction coefficient for NADH (ϵ340 nm = 6,220 m–1 cm–1) and the time interval of the absorbance change. These values were then plotted against the corresponding substrate concentrations, and the resulting plots were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation v0 = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]) using Igor Pro version 4.05A. Metal Analyses—Metal analyses were performed using a Varian Liberty 150 ICP-AES spectrometer. All purified enzyme samples were diluted to ∼10 μm with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. A calibration curve with four standards and a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.999 was generated using serial dilutions of Fisher metal standards. Three trials of each sample were averaged. The following wavelengths for the indicated metal ions were used to ensure the lowest detection limit possible: zinc, 213.856 nm; copper, 324.754 nm; nickel, 321.604 nm; cobalt, 238.892 nm; iron, 259.940 nm; and manganese, 257.610 nm. Size Exclusion Chromatography—A 120-ml Sephacryl S-200 HR size exclusion column was used to determine the molecular masses of MBP-VanX and VanX. A calibration curve was used to relate molecular weight to the retention time. The standard proteins were blue dextran 2000 (molecular mass, 2 MDa), thyroglobulin (molecular mass, 669 kDa), ferritin (molecular mass, 440 kDa), catalase (molecular mass, 232 kDa), aldolase (molecular mass, 158 kDa), and albumin (molecular mass, 67 kDa). The mobile phase buffer was 0.05 m Na3PO4, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl, and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Analysis of protein location was conducted using UV-visible spectroscopy measuring the absorbance at 280 nm of every 2-ml fraction. UV-Visible Spectroscopy—All UV-visible spectra were collected on an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer with photodiode array detection measuring the UV-visible absorbance at each wavelength between 200 and 1,100 nm. Enzyme concentrations ranged from 200 μm to 1 mm, and enzyme samples were loaded in a 0.5-ml quartz cuvette. The buffer used for dilutions and for the blanks was 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C. The phosphinate inhibitor (22Yang K.W. Brandt J.J. Chatwood L.L. Crowder M.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 1087-1089Google Scholar, 23Wu Z. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) d-3-[(1-aminoethyl)phosphinyl]-2-methylpropionic acid was synthesized by Dr. Ke-Wu Yang and was dissolved in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. The solution of inhibitor was added directly to the VanX samples. EPR Spectroscopy—All EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Instruments ER 300 EPR spectrometer equipped with an ER 035M NMR gaussmeter and a Hewlett Packard 5352B microwave frequency counter. Spectra were recorded at various temperatures between 4 and 16 K using an Oxford Instruments liquid helium-cooled cryostat. Spectra were recorded with the following conditions: 2-milliwatt microwave power, 9.48-GHz microwave frequency, and 10-G modulation amplitude at 100 kHz. Conditions were chosen so as to be non-saturating. Spectra were integrated, and the base line was examined to verify that spectral distortion due to passage effects did not occur. Samples in solution were pipetted into 4-mm outer diameter quartz EPR tubes and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Precipitated VanX samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was decanted. A small volume of 30 mm Tris, pH 7.6, was added, and the solid was resuspended. The resulting slurry was then pipetted into an EPR tube and flash frozen. EPR spectra were simulated with the program XSophe (Bruker), assuming a spin Hamiltonian H = βg·S·H + S·D·S with S = 3/2 and where D > 0 corresponds to an MS = |±½〉 ground state Kramers' doublet. For Co(II), |D| is usually much greater than the Zeeman interaction (29Bennett B. Holz R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1923-1933Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar); with |D| ≫ βgSH, the simulations are insensitive to the precise magnitude of D and an arbitrary value of D = 50 cm–1 was assumed. The useful EPR parameters that can be extracted from the simulations are greal and E/D (30Bennett B. Curr. Top. Biophys. 2002; 26: 49-57Google Scholar). X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy—MBP-VanX samples were concentrated to ∼1 mm using ultrafiltration and were prepared with 30% (v/v) added glycerol as glassing agent. Samples were loaded in Lucite cuvettes with 6-μm polypropylene windows and frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen. X-ray absorption spectra were measured at the National Synchrotron Light Source, beamline X9B, with a silicon(111) double crystal monochromator; harmonic rejection was accomplished using a curved nickel focusing mirror. Fluorescence excitation spectra for all samples were measured with a 13-element solid-state germanium detector array. The detectors were run at a total incident count rate of <100 kHz per channel with fluorescence count rates (Kα) of ∼ 1.5 kHz per channel. Samples were held at or below 15 K in a Displex cryostat during X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. EXAFS spectra were measured with 10-eV steps below the edge, 0.5-eV steps in the edge region, and 0.05-Å–1 steps in the EXAFS region. Integration times varied from 1 s in the pre-edge region to 13 s at k ≈ 12 Å–1. X-ray energies were calibrated by reference to the absorption spectrum of the appropriate metal foil measured concurrently with protein spectra. The first inflection point of the metal foil was assigned as the Kα binding energy: 7,709 eV for cobalt and 9,659 eV for zinc. Data were processed using SixPack (SixPack is available free of charge from www-ssrl.slac.Stanford.edu/~swebb/sixpack.htm). Both fluorescence and incident count rates from each detector channel were examined, to confirm the absence of artifacts, prior to averaging. Final spectra were obtained by averaging four to six scans per sample with the inclusion of 10–12 detector channels per scan. Background subtraction included a Gaussian pre-edge, centered at approximately the Kα fluorescence energy, and a three-region spline of fourth order in the EXAFS region. Data were converted from energy to k space using k=2me(E−E0/ℏ2) with E0 set at 7,745 eV (cobalt) or 9,675 eV (zinc). Resultant EXAFS spectra were Fourier-transformed over the range k = 1–12.1 Å–1 (cobalt) or 1–13.6 Å–1 (zinc). The first shell (r = 0.6–2.2 Å (cobalt), r = 0.7–2.1 Å (zinc)) was reverse Fourier-transformed over the same k range. The Fourier-filtered first shell EXAFS (∼10 degrees of freedom) data were fitted to Equation 1 using the nonlinear leastsquares engine of IFEFFIT (IFEFFIT is available free of charge from cars9.uchicago.edu/ifeffit and is distributed with SixPack).χ(k)=∑NasAs(k)SckRas2exp(−2k2σas2)exp(−2Ras/λ)sin[2kRas+ϕas(k)](Eq. 1) In Equation 1, Ns is the number of scattering atoms within a given radius (Ras ± σ), As(k) is the backscattering amplitude of the absorber-scatterer (as) pair, ϕas(k) is the phase shift experienced by the photoelectron as it encounters the electron clouds of the scattering and absorbing atoms, λ is the photoelectron mean free path, and the sum is taken over all shells of scattering atoms. Theoretical amplitude and phase functions, As(k)exp(–2Ras/λ) and ϕas(k), were calculated using FEFF version 8.00 (31Ankudinov A.L. Ravel B. Rehr J.J. Conradson S.D. Phys. Rev. B: Condens. Matter. 1998; 58: 7565-7576Crossref Scopus (4052) Google Scholar). Optimal absorber-scatterer-specific scale factors, Sc, were determined by fitting experimental spectra for compounds of known structure (0.78 for Co—N from cobalt(II) trispyrazolylborate (32Kolotilov S.V. Addison A.W. Trofimenko S. Dougherty W. Pavlishchuk V.V. Inorg. Chem. Commun. 2004; 7: 485-488Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and 0.74 for Zn—N from zinc(II) tetrakisimidazole (33McClure C.P.

Fits to protein data were then obtained for all reasonable integer coordination numbers holding Sc fixed and allowing ΔE0, Ras, and σ2as to vary. The best all nitrogen fits are summarized in Table II. Similar results were obtained using a single shell of oxygen atoms to model the first shell. Markedly better fit residuals were obtained with mixed nitrogen/oxygen models; however, the data do not possess sufficient degrees of freedom to warrant the use of multiple atom types, and these fits are not reported.Table IIEXAFS fitting results for Zn(II)- and Co(II)-MBP-VanXSampleNaInteger coordination number giving the best fit.

In our case, this method involved the removal of naturally occurring Zn(II) by dialysis versus chelators and the addition of Co(II) to apoVanX. Despite considerable efforts, we could not use this method to prepare Co(II)-substituted VanX in concentrations sufficient for spectroscopic studies as the protein precipitated during dialysis and concentration steps, and frequently Co(II) oxidized to Co(III) during the steps. Therefore, a biosynthetic method to prepare Co(II)-substituted VanX was used (28Rajagopalan P.T. Grimme S. Pei D.

Systems biology may be broadly defined as the integration of diverse data into useful biological models that allow scientists to easily observe complex cellular behaviors and predict the outcomes of metabolic and genetic perturbations. As a first step toward the elucidation of the systems biology of the model organism Escherichia coli, we have elected to limit our initial efforts to the development of a mathematical model for the complex but well studied metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of the branched chain amino acids l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-leucine. The biosynthetic pathways for the branched chain amino acids are shown in Fig. 1 (1Umbarger H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 532-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 2Umbarger H.E.

However, because the parallel pathways for l-valine and l-isoleucine biosynthesis are catalyzed by a set of bi-functional enzymes that bind substrates from either pathway, l-valine inhibition of the first enzyme specific for its biosynthesis catalyzed by a single α-acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS) could compromise the cell for l-isoleucine biosynthesis or result in the accumulation of a toxic metabolic intermediate, α-ketobutyrate (αKB). This type of regulatory problem is often solved by using multiple isozymes with different substrate preferences that are differentially regulated by multiple end products of parallel pathways. In this case, there are three AHAS isozymes that catalyze the first step of the l-valine and the second step of the l-isoleucine pathway (4Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Gollop N. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3750-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AHAS I has substrate preferences for the condensation of two pyruvate molecules required for l-valine biosynthesis and is end product-inhibited by l-valine (4Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Gollop N. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3750-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AHAS III shows no preference for pyruvate or αKB. Although this isozyme can produce intermediates for both l-valine and l-isoleucine, it is inhibited by l-valine (4Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Gollop N. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3750-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AHAS II isozyme has substrate preferences for the condensation of pyruvate and the αKB required for l-isoleucine biosynthesis, and it is not inhibited by any of the branched chain amino acids (4Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Gollop N. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3750-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, AHAS II is not active in the E. coli. K12 strain (5Lawther R.P. Calhoun D.H. Gray J. Adams C.W. Hauser C.A. Hatfield G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 294-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, this strain cannot grow in the presence of high levels of l-valine unless l-isoleucine is also added to the growth medium (6Umbarger H.E. Brown B. J. Bacteriol. 1955; 70: 241-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TDA is an allosteric enzyme whose kinetic behavior can be described by the concerted allosteric transition mode of the Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (MWC) model (7Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar, 8Hatfield G.W. Umbarger H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1742-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the MWC model, TDA can exist in an active state (R) or an inactive state (T) (8Hatfield G.W. Umbarger H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1742-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Changeux J.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 497-504Crossref Google Scholar). The fraction of active enzyme in the R or T states is determined by the concentrations and relative affinities of the substrate (l-threonine), the inhibitor (l-isoleucine), and the activator (l-valine) for the R and T states. In addition to these regulatory circuits, the intracellular levels of the branched chain amino acids are influenced by the reversible transamination reactions of each pathway. When the intracellular levels of any of the end product amino acids become high, reverse reactions to their cognate ketoacids are favored; for example, high concentrations of l-valine can be converted to α-ketoisovalerate to supplement l-leucine production. In turn, intracellular amino acid levels can be affected by their active transport from the extracellular growth medium. Therefore, the enzyme reactions required for the active transport of the branched chain amino acids into the cell against a concentration gradient are included in our simulations. The Mathematical Model—Here we use kMech (10Yang C.-R. Shapiro B.E. Mjolsness E.D. Hatfield G.W. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 (in press)Google Scholar), a Cellerator (11Shapiro B.E. Levchenko A. Meyerowitz E.M. Wold B.J. Mjolsness E.D. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) language extension that describes a suite of enzyme reaction mechanisms. Each enzyme mechanism is parsed by kMech into a set of fundamental association-dissociation reactions that are translated by Cellerator into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are numerically solved by Mathematica™ (10Yang C.-R. Shapiro B.E. Mjolsness E.D. Hatfield G.W. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 (in press)Google Scholar). To build a model for a metabolic pathway, users need only to string together appropriate kMech enzyme mechanism models and provide the physical and kinetic parameters for each enzyme. The development of approximation methods for estimating unavailable model parameters such as forward and reverse rate constants (kf and kr) from kinetic measurements (Km and kcat) is described elsewhere (10Yang C.-R. Shapiro B.E. Mjolsness E.D. Hatfield G.W. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 (in press)Google Scholar). The detailed kMech models for each of the pathway enzymes (Fig. 1), a Mathematica™-executable kMech.m file, and a Mathematica™ notebook file with detailed kMech inputs and the corresponding ODEs, kinetic rate constants, and initial conditions for solving the ODEs (or its Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) version) are available at the University of California, Irvine, Institute for Genomics and the Bioinformatics web site (www.igb.uci.edu/servers/sb.html). The PDF version of the Mathematica™ notebook and a list of reported and optimized enzyme kinetic and physical parameters used in simulations are available in the supplemental data in the on-line version of this article. Cellerator, available at www.aig.jpl.nasa.gov/public/mls/cellerator/feedback.html, is free of charge to academic, United States government, and other nonprofit organizations. Carbon Flow Channeling—Traditional modeling approaches use the Michaelis-Menten kinetic equation for one substrate/one product reactions and the King-Altman method to derive equations for more complex multiple reactant reactions. These types of equations focus on conversion between metabolites (metabolic flux) rather than enzyme mechanisms. Although metabolic flux provides valuable information about biomass conversions (12Edwards J.S. Ibarra R.U. Palsson B.O. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), it cannot simulate, for example, the pathway-specific regulation patterns that control carbon flow channeling through the three AHAS isozymes of the parallel l-isoleucine and l-valine pathways and the final transamination reactions. This level of mathematical modeling requires a detailed understanding of enzyme kinetic mechanisms and regulatory circuits (Fig. 2) as described below. α-Acetohydroxy Acid Synthase (AHAS) Isozymes—The AHAS isozymes are controllers of carbon flow into either the l-isoleucine or l-valine biosynthetic pathway. The Ping Pong Bi Bi enzyme mechanism of these isozymes describes a specialized two-substrate, two-product (Bi Bi) mechanism in which the binding of substrates and release of products is ordered. It is a Ping Pong mechanism because the enzyme shuttles between a free and a substrate-modified intermediate state indicated as white and shaded ovals, respectively, in Fig. 2. Carbon flow through these isozymes is controlled by the affinities (Km) of the enzyme intermediates for their second substrates as shown in Fig. 2 (13Herring P.A. McKnight B.L. Jackson J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For example, the AHAS II enzyme reactions shown in Fig. 1 are described by the two reaction sets designated Reaction 1 and Reaction 2.Reaction 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reaction 1 is for the condensation of two pyruvate (Pyr) molecules for the biosynthesis of the α-acetolactate of the l-valine and l-leucine pathways. Reaction 2 is for the condensation of one Pyr molecule and one αKB molecule for the biosynthesis of the α-acetohydroxybutyrate of the l-isoleucine pathway. As written in the reactions, the initial reaction of Pyr with free AHAS II to form the activated enzyme intermediate is represented twice. Therefore, if these reactions were modeled, two molecules of Pyr would be consumed instead of just one for each molecule of Pyr or α KB produced. This redundancy can be resolved by rewriting these reactions as shown in Reaction 3. In Mathematica™, the Union operator is used in conjunction with the kMech PingPong models to solve this redundancy of pathways problem. The user kMech inputs in Mathematica™ syntax for the channeling of pyruvate through the AHAS II isozyme into l-valine or l-isoleucine are shown in Reaction 4. In this reaction, Pyr and aKB (α-acetolactate) are substrates, aAL (α-acetolactate), aAHB (α-acetohydroxybutyrate), and CO2 are products, AHASII is free enzyme, AHASIICH3CO is the modified enzyme intermediate (it is underlined in Reactions 1, 2, 3 to indicate that it is in the intermediate state after reacting with the first substrate), Enz[...] denotes a kMech enzyme model that provides additional capabilities to Cellerator, PingPong indicates that the enzyme model is Ping Pong Bi Bi, variable names with a kf prefix are rate constants of the enzyme-substrate associations, variable names with a kr prefix are rate constants of the enzyme substrate dissociations, and variable names with a kcat prefix are catalytic rate constants for the formation of products. kMech parses the three non-redundant AHAS II reactions shown above into elementary association-dissociation reactions and produces the output in Cellerator/Mathematica™ syntax (11Shapiro B.E. Levchenko A. Meyerowitz E.M. Wold B.J. Mjolsness E.D. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) shown in Reaction 5. This output is passed to Cellerator where the differential equations that describe the rate of change for each reactant involved in the AHAS II isozyme reaction are generated in Mathematica™ syntax and presented collectively in Reaction 6. These differential equations and variable definitions are passed to Mathematica™, where they are solved by the numeric solver (NDSolve) function, and graphs of enzyme product versus time are generated.Reaction 6View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Union operator also was used for the modeling of the l-valine-inhibited AHAS I and AHAS III isozymes described in the supplemental data in the on-line version of this article. Detailed descriptions of other kMech models used in this simulation are published elsewhere (10Yang C.-R. Shapiro B.E. Mjolsness E.D. Hatfield G.W. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 (in press)Google Scholar). Reversible Transamination Mechanism—The pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent transaminase B (TB) enzyme catalyzes the final, reversible step of the biosynthetic pathways of all three of the branched chain amino acids (Figs. 1 and 2). The first step of each of these Ping Pong Bi Bi transamination reactions uses glutamate as an amino donor to form a pyridoxamine-bound enzyme intermediate (TBNH2, shaded oval in Fig. 2) for the transamination of the three different α-ketoacids of each pathway. Carbon flow through TB is controlled by the affinities (Km) of the enzyme intermediates for their second α-ketoacid substrates as shown in Fig. 2. The TB enzyme reactions of Fig. 1 are described by the chemical equations shown in Reactions 7, 8, 9. Because the first substrate reaction with glutamate is the same for all three of the branched chain α-ketoacid second substrates, the Mathematica™ Union operator is once again used to eliminate this redundancy as shown in Reaction 10. Because transamination is reversible, kMech models must be entered in both reaction directions for each of the three branched chain amino acid transaminations and, again, the Union operator is used to eliminate the duplicated second substrate reactions (TBNH2 + aKG ⇔ TBNH2·aKG → TB + Glu; TBNH2 is underlined to indicate that the TB enzyme is in the intermediate state after reacting with the first substrate) of each transamination (long gray arrows in Fig. 2) as shown in Reaction 11.Reaction 8View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reaction 9View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reaction 10View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reaction 11View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These reactions are parsed by kMech into elementary association-dissociation reactions and passed on to Cellerator, where they are processed as described above. The same method was used for modeling transaminase C, a reversible Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism enzyme that uses alanine as the amino donor for the transamination of l-valine (Fig. 2). Allosteric Regulation—Threonine deaminase is an allosteric enzyme whose kinetic behavior can be described by the concerted allosteric transition model of Monod, Wyman, Changeux known as the MWC model (7Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar, 8Hatfield G.W. Umbarger H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1742-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the MWC model, TDA can exist in an active state (R) or an inactive state (T) (8Hatfield G.W. Umbarger H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1742-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Changeux J.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 497-504Crossref Google Scholar). The fraction of enzyme in the R or T state is determined by the concentrations and relative affinities of the substrate (l-threonine), the inhibitor (l-isoleucine), and the activator (l-valine) for each state. This model is described by two equations, designated Equations 1 and 2, R=(1+α)nL(1+cα)n+(1+α)n(Eq. 1) Yf=v0Vmax=Lcα(1+cα)n−1+α(1+α)n−1L(1+cα)n+(1+α)n where L=L0(1+β)(1+y)n,α=SKm,β=IKi, and y=AKa(Eq. 2) in which S, I, and A are substrate, inhibitor, and activator concentrations, respectively, Km, Ki, and Ka are their respective dissociation constants, n is the number of substrate and effector ligand binding sites, c is the ratio of the affinity of the substrate for the catalytically active R state and the inhibited T state, L0 is the equilibrium constant (allosteric constant) for the R and T states in the absence of ligands, vo is the initial reaction velocity, and Vmax is the maximal reaction velocity. Equation 1 describes the fraction of the enzyme in the catalytically active state (R) as a function of substrate and effector concentrations. Equation 2 describes the fractional saturation (Yf = vo/Vmax) of the enzyme occupied by substrate as a function of substrate and effector concentrations (7Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar). We have recently described implementation of the MWC model in Cellerator (10Yang C.-R. Shapiro B.E. Mjolsness E.D. Hatfield G.W. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 (in press)Google Scholar). Experimental values of the kinetic parameters and ligand concentrations listed above are most often available in the literature. However, values of c and L0 are often not available. These values can be calculated by fitting substrate saturation curves in the presence and absence of several inhibitor concentrations (10Yang C.-R. Shapiro B.E. Mjolsness E.D. Hatfield G.W. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 (in press)Google Scholar, 14Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems.

Ph.D. thesis, pp. 103–112, Purdue UniversityGoogle Scholar). Approximation of Intracellular Enzyme Concentrations—With few exceptions, intracellular enzyme concentrations are not available. However, with careful experimental documentation, these concentrations can be approximated from the yields and specific activities of purified enzymes. For example, calculations based on purification tables in the literature suggest that the intracellular concentration of TDA is 4 μm (16Calhoun D.H. Rimerman R.A. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3511-3516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent experiments have shown a positive correlation between mRNA levels measured with DNA microarrays and protein abundance in both E. coli (17Arfin S.M. Long A.D. Ito E.T. Tolleri L. Riehle M.M. Paegle E.S. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29672-29684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and yeast cells (18Futcher B. Latter G.I. Monardo P. McLaughlin C.S. Garrels J.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7357-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 19Ideker T. Thorsson V. Ranish J.A. Christmas R. Buhler J. Eng J.K. Bumgarner R. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Hood L. Science. 2001; 292: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Thus, the intracellular levels of the remaining enzymes of the branched chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway can be inferred from the calculated intracellular level of TDA and the relative mRNA levels of the other branched chain amino acid biosynthetic enzymes using DNA microarray data (20Hung S.P. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40309-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The data in supplemental Table I in the on-line version of this article demonstrate that this is a reasonable method. Indeed, simulations using intracellular enzyme concentrations inferred in this manner produce experimentally observed steady-state pathway intermediate and end product levels (21Epelbaum S. LaRossa R.A. VanDyk T.K. Elkayam T. Chipman D.M. Barak Z. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4056-4067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Quay S.C. Dick T.E. Oxender D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), usually within 2-fold to one-half adjustments of these inferred values. Optimization of Model Parameters—A list of reported enzyme kinetic and physical parameters needed to solve the differential equations for the simulations reported here, and their literature sources are available in supplemental Table I in the on-line version of this article. The optimized values to simulate known steady-state intracellular levels of pathway substrates, intermediates, and end products are also listed for comparison. In brief, for each enzyme there are at least three parameters needed, namely the total enzyme concentration (ET), the Km for each substrate, and the kcat for each enzyme reaction. For enzymes with additional regulatory mechanism, extra parameters such as the Ki for each inhibitor and the Ka for each activator also are required. In the initial simulation, ET values were inferred from microarray data as described above, and the Km and kcat values were obtained from in vitro enzyme kinetic data of purified enzymes with the exception of transaminase C and α-isopropylmalate isomerase, where empirical values were used because of a lack of experimental data. These values were manually adjusted to match the published in vivo steady-state levels of intermediate and end product metabolites (21Epelbaum S. LaRossa R.A. VanDyk T.K. Elkayam T. Chipman D.M. Barak Z. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4056-4067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Quay S.C. Dick T.E. Oxender D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inferred ET and in vitro Km values work quit well, because the adjustments are usually within 2-fold to one-half of the initial values. However, because many variables can influence in vitro measurements, including the relative activities of purified enzymes, larger corrections were sometimes necessary for the estimation of kcat values (5 of 9 enzymes). Once the mathematical model was optimized with the parameters reported in supplemental Table I in the on-line version of this article, it was used without further adjustment for the simulations of the metabolic and genetic perturbations reported below. Computational Modeling of the Dynamics of Carbon Flow through the Branched Chain Amino Acid Biosynthetic Pathways of E. coli K12—The three interacting metabolic pathways simulated here consist of 11 enzymes, 18 metabolic intermediates, and three enzyme cofactors. The mathematical model for this metabolic system consists of 105 ODEs with 110 association and dissociation rate constants and 52 catalytic rate constants. The enzymes of these interacting pathways employ three distinct enzyme mechanisms (simple catalytic, Bi Bi, and Ping Pong Bi Bi) that are regulated by allosteric, competitive, or noncompetitive inhibition mechanisms. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the physical parameters for these models have been obtained directly from the literature, calculated from data in the literature, or estimated by fitting experimental data (supplemental Table I in the on-line version of this article). Relative intracellular enzyme levels have been inferred from enzyme purification and DNA microarray data (20Hung S.P. Baldi P. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40309-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The steady-state levels for the thirteen pathway intermediates and end products are shown in Fig. 3. Steady-state enzyme activity levels were optimized to properly channel the steady-state flow of intermediates through these pathways to match reported in vivo levels of pathway intermediates and end products (21Epelbaum S. LaRossa R.A. VanDyk T.K. Elkayam T. Chipman D.M. Barak Z. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4056-4067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Quay S.C. Dick T.E. Oxender D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The detailed kMech inputs, corresponding ODEs, kinetic rate constants, and initial conditions for solving the ODEs are presented in supplemental Fig. 1, available in the on-line version of this article. Allosteric Regulation of TDA—The allosteric regulatory mechanism of TDA was simulated with the MWC model employing physical parameters based on the literature or optimized to fit experimental data (10Yang C.-R. Shapiro B.E. Mjolsness E.D. Hatfield G.W. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 (in press)Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 3 show that TDA produces αKB at a steady-state level comparable with that observed in vivo (21Epelbaum S. LaRossa R.A. VanDyk T.K. Elkayam T. Chipman D.M. Barak Z. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4056-4067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Quay S.C. Dick T.E. Oxender D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Ki for l-isoleucine (15 μm) is much less than the Ka for l-valine (550 μm), an initial decrease in the production of αKB as l-isoleucine accumulates is followed by an increase to a final steady level that accompanies the accumulation of l-valine (Fig. 3). Correspondingly, the fraction of active TDA is initially decreased as l-isoleucine accumulates and countered to a steady level (5.5% of the total enzyme is in the active R state), whereas l-valine accumulates (Fig. 4A). A similar pattern was observed for the fractional saturation of TDA with l-threonine (vo/Vmax) in response to changes in the levels of its effector ligands, l-isoleucine and l-valine. At its steady-state level, TDA is only ∼1.2% saturated with l-threonine (Fig. 4B). Regulation of the AHAS Isozymes—The two-substrate, two-product, AHAS isozymes I and III employ a Ping Pong Bi Bi enzyme mechanism described under “Experimental Procedures” (the AHAS II isoz"

It plays a putative role in the development and progression of cancer. When expressed in cells, the mitogenic activity of HDGF depends on its nuclear localization, but it also stimulates proliferation when added to the cell culture medium. A cell surface receptor for HDGF has not been identified so far. We investigated the interaction of various purified recombinant HDGF fusion proteins with the cell surface of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. We showed that binding of a HDGF-β-galactosidase fusion protein to the cell surface of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts was saturable, occurred with high affinity (KD = 14 nm), and had a proliferative effect. We identified a peptide comprising amino acid residues 81–100 within the amino-terminal part of HDGF that bound to the cell surface of NIH 3T3 cells with saturation and affinity values similar to those of HDGF. When added to primary human fibroblasts, this peptide stimulated proliferation. Substitution of a single amino acid (K96A) within this peptide was sufficient to abolish its binding to the cell surface and its proliferative activity. In contrast, when expressed transiently in NIH 3T3 cells, a HDGF-β-galactosidase fusion protein in which amino acid residues 81–100 were deleted still had proliferative activity, whereas a fusion protein containing only the 81–100 peptide did not. Our results suggest the existence of a plasma membrane-located HDGF receptor for which signaling depends on amino acid residues 81–100 of HDGF.

However, compared with other growth factor families, our current knowledge regarding HDGF and HRPs is still limited. The main cellular localization of HDGF is nuclear, although in some cells, HDGF can be found in the cytosol (3Nakamura H. Izumoto Y. Kambe H. Kuroda T. Mori T. Kawamura K. Yamamoto H. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25143-25149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Oliver J.A. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin.

HDGF has two nuclear localization signals, one in the conserved HATH region, and the other in the carboxyl-terminal area specific for the different family members. The nuclear localization has been shown to be a prerequisite for the mitogenic activity of intracellularly expressed HDGF (5Everett A.D. Stoops T. McNamara C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37564-37568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Kishima Y. Yamamoto H. Izumoto Y. Yoshida K. Enomoto H. Yamamoto M. Kuroda T. Ito H. Yoshizaki K. Nakamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10315-10322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Several groups have shown independently that HDGF is mitogenic not only when expressed in cells but also when applied exogenously (2Nakamura H. Kambe H. Egawa T. Kimura Y. Ito H. Hayashi E. Yamamoto H. Sato J. Kishimoto S. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 183: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 3Nakamura H. Izumoto Y. Kambe H. Kuroda T. Mori T. Kawamura K. Yamamoto H. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25143-25149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its purification from cell culture medium and its mitogenic properties as an exogenous ligand, HDGF lacks a classical signal sequence and is only poorly secreted by transfected cell lines. In this respect, it resembles FGF-1 and FGF-2. Current data for these FGF family members suggest that these growth factors may be released from cells via a mechanism independent of the secretory endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-plasma membrane pathway (27Florkiewicz R.Z. Majack R.A. Buechler R.D. Florkiewicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 28Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell.

Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). For exogenously applied HDGF and its related protein, LEDGF, it has also been shown that they can be internalized, and it has been proposed that the mitogenic action of exogenous HDGF depends on internalization and subsequent nuclear translocation (26Kishima Y. Yamamoto H. Izumoto Y. Yoshida K. Enomoto H. Yamamoto M. Kuroda T. Ito H. Yoshizaki K. Nakamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10315-10322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 31Fatma N. Singh D.P. Shinohara T. Chylack Jr., L.T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2648-2657PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization would require a cell surface receptor, and in this respect, it is important to note that HDGF strongly binds heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs) (4Dietz F. Franken S. Yoshida K. Nakamura H. Kappler J. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Sue S.C. Chen J.Y. Lee S.C. Wu W.G. Huang T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of internalization has not yet been revealed. Alternatively, exogenous HDGF may also bind to a hitherto unknown plasma membrane receptor coupled to a proliferative signal transduction pathway. In accordance with this, rapid phosphorylation of Erk1/2 upon addition of HDGF to pulmonary epithelial cells has recently been demonstrated (44Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Kikuchi T. Sueno T. Reddy V.N. Yuge K. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). With the exception of HLGAGs, however, no specific cellular receptor for HDGF or the related proteins has been identified so far. In this study, we examined the mode of action of HDGF on NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. By using various HDGF-β-galactosidase fusion proteins, we searched for the HDGF region responsible for binding to the cell surface. We report the identification of a peptide region in the amino terminus of HDGF that was sufficient to interact with the cell surface and activate proliferation of fibroblasts. Deletion of this peptide region demonstrated that HDGF signals from the cell surface of fibroblasts, rather than after internalization and translocation to the nucleus of these cells. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were from Sigma. Construction of β-Galactosidase and GFP Fusion Proteins—For bacterial expression of β-galactosidase fusion proteins, the coding region of the enzyme containing six histidine residues at the carboxyl terminus was amplified by PCR using the plasmid pCMVβ from Clontech, which contains the complete β-galactosidase coding region. The cDNA coding for the β-galactosidase-histidine fusion protein (βGalHis) was cloned into TRC99a vector (Amersham Biosciences) via a KpnI and HindIII restriction site inserted in the primers used for amplification (for sequences of primers and shape of the recombinant protein products, see Table I and Fig. 2). All HDGF fragments were amplified by PCR using primers containing EcoRI (sense) and KpnI (antisense) restriction sites (for primers, see Table I). DNA fragments coding for fewer than 20 amino acids were not generated by PCR but by hybridization of the respective sense and antisense oligonucleotides (for sequences, see Table I). After digestion with EcoRI and KpnI, the fragments were inserted 5′ of the βGalHis coding region in Trc99a vector. In all cases, the ATG within the NcoI restriction site of the vector served as the starting point of translation.Table ISequences of all primers and oligonucleotides used to create the fusion constructs depicted in Fig. 2NameSequence (5′→3′)Restriction siteβ-Galactosidase senseCTCGAGCTCGGTACCTCGTTTACTTTGACCAACAAGAKpnIβ-Galactosidase antisenseGAAGAGCCCAAGCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTGACACCAGACCAACTGGHindIIIHDGF senseCTCGAGCTCGAATTCTCGCGATCCAACCGGCAGEcoRIHDGF antisenseGAAGAGCCCTGGTACCCAGGCTCTCATGATCTCKpnINon-HATH senseCTCGAGCTCGAATTCCAGTCCTCCCAGAAAAAGEcoRINon-HATH antisenseGAAGAGCCCTGGTACCCAGGCTCTCATGATCTCKpnIHATH senseCTCGAGCTCGAATTCTCGCGATCCAACCGGCAGEcoRIHATH antisenseGAAGAGCCCTGGTACCGTAGCCAGAGGCCTTGKpnIHATH80 senseCTCGAGCTCGAATTCTCGCGATCCAACCGGCAGEcoRIHATH80 antisenseGAAGAGCCCTGGTACCTTTCCTCTTGTTGGGCKpnIHATH60 senseCTCGAGCTCGAATTCTCGCGATCCAACCGGCAGEcoRIHATH60 antisenseGAAGAGCCCTGGTACCGGGGCCCAGGAATGCCGKpnIHATH40 senseCTCGAGCTCGAATTCTCGCGATCCAACCGGCAGEcoRIHATH40 antisenseGAAGAGCCCTGGTACCTGACTTCACTGCAGCCTCKpnIHATH20 senseAATTCTCGCGATCCAACCGGCAGAAAGAGTACAAGTGCGGAGACCTGGTGTTTGCGAAGATGGGTACEcoRI and KpnIHATH20 antisenseGAGCGCTAGGTTGGCCGTCTTTCTCATGTTCACGCCTCTGGACCACAAACGCTTCTACCEcoRI and KpnIHATH81-100 senseAATTCGGGTTCAGCGAGGGGCTGTGGGAGATCGAGAACAACCCTACAGTCAAGGCCTCTGGCTACGGTACEcoRI and KpnIHATH81-100 antisenseCGTAGCCAGAGGCCTTGACTGTAGGGTTGTTCTCGATCTCCCACAGCCCCTCGCTGAACCCGEcoRI and KpnIHATH61-100 senseCCATGGAATTCAAAGACCTCTTCCCTTATGAGEcoRIHATH61-100 antisenseGAAGAGCCCTGGTACCGTAGCCAGAGGCCTTGKpnIHDGFK96A senseCCCTACAGTCGCGGCCTCTGGCTAHDGFK96A antisenseTAGCCAGAGGCCGCGACTGTAGGGGFP senseAGCTCGGTACCGTGAGCAAGGGCGAKpnIGFP antisenseAGCCCAAGCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCTTGTACAGCTCGTCHindIII Open table in a new tab Histidine-tagged GFP fusion proteins were prepared by amplifying the coding region of GFP using plasmid eGFP-C3 (Clontech) as template for PCR (for primer sequences, see Table I). The PCR product was purified, digested with HindIII and KpnI, and exchanged with the βGalHis sequence in the Trc99a vector described above. For eucaryotic expression, the coding sequences of the fusion proteins were cut from Trc99a vector by EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into pCDNA3/Zeo vector (Clontech) with an altered multicloning site containing an ATG in front of the EcoRI site. Histidine-tagged HDGF was produced as described elsewhere (4Dietz F. Franken S. Yoshida K. Nakamura H. Kappler J. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sequences of all recombinant cDNA constructs were verified by cycle sequencing on an ABI 310 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—All recombinant proteins were produced and purified by means of their carboxyl-terminal His6 tag as described elsewhere (4Dietz F. Franken S. Yoshida K. Nakamura H. Kappler J. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Purity and correct molecular weight of the recombinant proteins were examined by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotting using antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal histidine residues. Protein concentrations were determined by comparison with known concentrations of bovine serum albumin on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel and by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cell Culture—All media and chemicals for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen, and all plastic material was purchased from BD Biosciences. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Subconfluent cells were passaged every 3 days by treatment with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA for up to 2 months. Primary human skin fibroblasts were cultured in the same medium as described for NIH 3T3 cells and passaged once a week. HDGF Binding Assay—Cells were seeded into wells of a 96-well microtiter plate at a density of 12,000 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Free protein binding sites were blocked with 200 μl of blocking buffer (2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 h at 4 °C. Binding of the different βGalHis fusion proteins was performed in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, and 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) for 2.5 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with washing buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4) and one time with washing buffer containing no Tween 20, bound β-galactosidase activity was determined by adding 100 μl of 1 mm chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (CRPG substrate; Roche Applied Science) in binding buffer to each well. After 1 h at 37 °C, color development was measured at 595 nm in a microplate reader. Alternatively, cell surface-bound β-galactosidase fusion proteins were visualized by incubation with 250 μl of β-galactosidase substrate (40 mg/ml X-gal in dimethylformamide, 200 mm K4Fe(CN)6/K3Fe(CN)6, and 2 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C for 3 h. Proliferation Assay—Mitogenic activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of tritium-labeled thymidine into DNA of proliferating cells (32Corps A.N. Brown K.D. McKay I. Leigh I. Growth Factors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 35-54Google Scholar). Primary human skin fibroblasts were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 6,000 cells/cm2 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 6 days, medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no fetal bovine serum but containing different concentrations of the respective histidine-tagged recombinant proteins or synthetically produced peptides (EMC, Tuebingen, Germany). In addition, each well received 8.9 kBq [3H]thymidine (specific activity, 365 MBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and cells were incubated for an additional 20 h. Cells were harvested and processed as described previously (32Corps A.N. Brown K.D. McKay I. Leigh I. Growth Factors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 35-54Google Scholar), and incorporation of radioactivity was measured in a 1900CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard). For the determination of cell numbers after transfection, the MTS assay was performed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Promega). Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy—The setup of the microscope was as described elsewhere (33Meissner O. Haberlein H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For measurements on living cells by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, all proteins where produced as GFP fusion proteins in HEK 293 cells and purified by means of their histidine tags as described. All cells were tested for binding of the fluorescent ligands at the concentrations given under “Results.” In addition, for all cells and ligands, laser scans were recorded as described by Hegener et al. (34Hegener O. Jordan R. Haberlein H. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1801-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Hegener O. Prenner L. Runkel F. Baader S.L. Kappler J. Haberlein H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6190-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All values are shown as the mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance was performed for comparison of data between two or more groups. A probability value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant, and a value of p < 0.01 was considered to be statistically highly significant. Binding curves were calculated using Origin V. 7.5 software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). HDGF-β-Galactosidase Fusion Protein Binding to NIH 3T3 Cells Is Saturable and Accompanied by a Proliferative Response—In proliferation assays, HDGF displays growth factor activity when added to the medium of various cell types (1Klagsbrun M.

Hepatogastroenterology. 2000; 47: 1645-1648PubMed Google Scholar). A prerequisite for this activity is the interaction of HDGF with the cell surface. A HDGF receptor, however, has not yet been identified. To find evidence for a putative HDGF receptor, we expressed and purified a HDGF-β-galactosidase fusion protein. Fig. 1, A and B, shows that the recombinant HDGF-βGalHis fusion protein (see Fig. 2 for description) bound to NIH 3T3 cells, whereas βGalHis used as a control did not. Cell binding studies using increasing amounts of the HDGF-βGalHis fusion protein demonstrated that this interaction was saturable. Half-maximal binding occurred at ∼14 nm (Fig. 1C). In addition, HDGF-βGalHis added to the cell culture medium stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into primary human fibroblasts (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5HDGF sequence harbors two distinct proliferation-inducing activities. A, wild-type and K96A-substituted peptides comprising amino acids 81–100 were produced synthetically. Different concentrations of both peptides were added in serum-free medium to human skin fibroblasts, and proliferation was quantified after 20 h by the amount of incorporated [3H]thymidine. At higher concentrations, a significant difference in mitogenic activity between wild-type (pep81–100) and substituted peptide (pep81–100K96A) can be observed. Medium without peptide and medium substituted with 10% fetal bovine serum were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Values are given as means ± S.D. (n = 3). p values are given in the figure. B, β-galactosidase fusion proteins of wild-type (HDGF-βGalHis) and mutated HDGF bearing the K96A substitution (HDGFK96A-βGalHis) or missing amino acids 81–100 (ΔHDGF-βGalHis) were produced and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” 4 nm of each of the proteins was added in serum-free medium to human skin fibroblasts, and proliferation was quantified after 20 h by the amount of incorporated [3H]thymidine. 4 nm of non-fused β-galactosidase (βGalHis) was used as a negative control. In contrast to wild-type HDGF, none of the mutated HDGF proteins were able to stimulate proliferation compared with β-galactosidase when added to the cell culture medium. Values are given as means ± S.D. (n = 3). *, p < 0.05; ns, not significant compared with βGalHis control. [3H]Thymidine incorporation as a measure of proliferation activity is given in cpm. C, eucaryotic expression vectors coding for β-galactosidase fusion proteins of HDGF bearing the K96A substitution (HDGFK96A-βGalHis) or missing amino acids 81–100 (ΔHDGF-βGalHis) and a peptide-β-galactosidase fusion protein (HATH81–100-βGalHis) were constructed as described under “Materials and Methods” and transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Vectors coding for non-fused β-galactosidase (βGalHis) and wild-type HDGF fused to β-galactosidase (HDGF-βGalHis) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. 48 h later, cell numbers were determined using the MTS assay. All constructs induced proliferation, whereas peptide 81–100 from the HATH region was not able to induce proliferation when expressed as a fusion protein inside the cell. Values are given as means ± S.D.

Structurally, all members of the HDGF family share a conserved amino-terminal 100-amino acid HATH region and possess a non-conserved carboxyl-terminal non-HATH region (4Dietz F. Franken S. Yoshida K.

The fission yeast genome encodes a single set of catalytic (Ppb1) and regulatory (Cnb1) subunits, providing an ideal model system to study the functions of these subunits in vivo. Here, we cloned the cnb1+ gene and showed that the cnb1 knock-out (Δcnb1) exhibits identical phenotypes with Δppb1 and that overexpression of Ppb1 failed to suppress the phenotypes of Δcnb1. Interestingly, overexpression of the C-terminal-deleted Ppb1 (Ppb1ΔC), the constitutively active form of Ppb1, also failed to suppress the phenotypes of Δcnb1. FK506 caused MgCl2 sensitivity to the wild-type cells in an FKBP12-dependentmanner. Co-overexpression of Ppb1 and Cnb1 suppressed the FK506-induced MgCl2 sensitivity, but the suppression was only partial, suggesting that an excess amount of the Ppb1-Cnb1 complex cannot compete out the FKBP12-FK506 complex. Although overexpression of Ppb1ΔC alone had little effect on cell growth, co-overexpression of Ppb1ΔC and Cnb1 caused a distinct growth defect. FK506 suppressed the growth defect when Cnb1 was co-expressed using the attenuated nmt1 promoter, but it failed to suppress the defect when Cnb1 was co-expressed using the wild-type nmt1 promoter. Knock-out of the prz1+ gene, encoding a downstream target transcription factor of calcineurin, suppressed the growth defect irrespective of the promoter potency. These results suggest that Cnb1 is essential for the activation of calcineurin and that the activated calcineurin is the pharmacological target of the FKBP12-FK506 complex in vivo.

Calcineurin is a heterodimer of a catalytic (calcineurin A) subunit and a Ca2+-binding regulatory (calcineurin B) subunit. In known mammalian cells, three genes encode the catalytic subunits, and two genes encode the regulatory subunits (4.Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the gene multiplicity encoding these subunits is unknown, and this makes it very difficult to study the role of each subunit of calcineurin in vivo. Genes encoding calcineurin subunit proteins are highly conserved among species from yeast to man (5.Cyert M.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 647-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote (6.Wood V. Gwilliam R. Rajandream M.A. Lyne M. Lyne R. Stewart A.

The small genome size and gene number of fission yeast as well as its relevance to a higher system makes it a highly suitable model system in which to study the calcineurin signaling pathway by a molecular genetic approach. We have previously shown that Ppb1 plays an essential role in maintaining chloride ion homeostasis (10.Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).

In addition, analyses of mutants that require calcineurin activity for their growth revealed that calcineurin is implicated in cytokinesis, the septation initiation network, and membrane trafficking in fission yeast (13.Zhang Y.

Recently, we cloned the prz1+ gene, which encodes a Crz1/Tcn1 transcription factor homolog, and results have suggested that calcineurin activates at least two distinct signaling branches, i.e. the Prz1-dependent branch that regulates the expression of the Pmc1 Ca2+ pump and an unknown pathway that functions antagonistically with the Pmk1 MAP kinase pathway (18.Hirayama S. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Maeda T. Kawagishi K. Yokoyama M. Tohda H. Giga-Hama Y. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18078-18084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies using recombinant mammalian proteins have suggested that the regulatory subunit as well as calmodulin is required for the high calcineurin activity in vitro (19.Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y.

Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26431-26437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no in vivo molecular genetic study on the functions of calcineurin subunits. As described above, S. pombe has a single set of catalytic and regulatory subunits, thus making it an ideal model system to study the role of these subunits in vivo using the molecular genetic approach. Here, we cloned the fission yeast cnb1+ gene, which encodes the regulatory subunit of calcineurin. Our present results suggest that the regulatory subunit is essential for the activation of calcineurin in vivo and that the activated calcineurin is the pharmacological target of the FKBP12-FK506 complex in vivo. Strains, Media, and Miscellaneous Procedures—S. pombe strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The complete medium YPD and the minimal medium EMM have been described previously (22.Toda T.

Standard methods for S. pombe genetics were followed according to Moreno et al. (23.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). FK506 was provided by the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co.

Also, gene disruptions are denoted by an abbreviation of the gene preceded by Δ (for example, Δcnb1). Proteins are denoted by Roman letters, and only the first letter is capitalized (for example, Cnb1). Data base searches were performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST network service (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the Sanger Center S. pombe data base search service (www.sanger.ac.uk). Gene Cloning and Expression—The cnb1+ gene was amplified by PCR with the genomic DNA of S. pombe as a template. The sense primer used for PCR was 5′-GAAAAGCTGCCATTGCAGTTG-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-CCTACCGAACTTACGCCTGC-3′. The amplified product containing the cnb1+ gene was digested with HindIII and PstI, and the resulting fragment was subcloned into Bluescript SK(+). For ectopic expression of proteins, we used the thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter (24.Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Expression was repressed by the addition of 4 μg/ml thiamine to EMM and was induced by washing and incubating the cells in EMM lacking thiamine. Genes either tagged or non-tagged were subcloned into the pREP1, pREP41, or pREP81 vectors to express the gene at various levels. Maximum expression of the fused gene was obtained using pREP1, whereas pREP81 contained the most attenuated version of the nmt1 promoter (24.Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). When the ppb1+ and cnb1+ genes were co-expressed, the ppb1+ gene was integrated into the chromosome and the cnb1+ gene was harbored in the plasmid. To obtain the chromosome-borne tagged or non-tagged genes instead of the plasmid-borne genes, the genes with the nmt1 promoter at various levels were subcloned into the vector containing the ura4+ marker and were integrated into the chromosome at the ura4+ gene locus of KP1248 (h– leu1–32 ura4–294) (25.Lafuente M.J. Petit T. Gancedo C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Deletion of the cnb1+Gene—A one-step gene disruption by homologous recombination (26.Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar) was performed. The cnb1::ura4+ disruption was constructed as follows. The cloned open reading frame of the cnb1+ gene in the Bluescript vector was digested with HindIII and PstI, and the resulting fragment containing the cnb1+ gene was subcloned into the HindIII/PstI site of pGEM-5Zf (+) (Promega). Then, an EcoRI fragment containing the ura4+ gene was inserted into the EcoRI site of the previous construct, causing the interruption of the open reading frame. The fragment containing the disrupted cnb1+ gene was transformed into haploid cells. Stable integrants were selected on medium lacking uracil, and disruption of the gene was checked by genomic Southern hybridization (data not shown). Cell Extract Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis—For the analysis of the expression of the tagged proteins, whole-cell extracts were prepared from cultures of cells grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase. Cells were resuspended in 450 μl of ice-cold homogenizing buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm sodium metabisulfite, chymostatin 0.1 μg/ml, aprotinin 2 μg/ml, pepstatin A 1 μg/ml, phosphoramidon 1 μg/ml, and leupeptin 0.5 μg/ml). Glass beads (0.2 g) were then added, and the cells were homogenized using a Mini-Beadbeater (BioSpec Products) at 5,000 rpm for 30 s, after which the tubes were placed on ice for 1 min. Homogenization and cooling were repeated twice, after which the glass beads and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. Protein extracts (10–20 μg/5 μl) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP, anti-GST, or anti-FLAG antibodies. Antibody to fission yeast Cdc4 protein was prepared by immunizing rabbit with the purified Cdc4 protein and was used for the detection of endogenous Cdc4 as a loading control. Mobility Shift Assay—Ppb1-deleted cells transformed with pREP1-FLAG-Prz1 were cultured for 20 h at 27 °C in EMM without thiamine to induce the expression of FLAG-Prz1. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold homogenizing buffer and homogenized using Mini-Beadbeater as described above. FLAG-Prz1 was immunoprecipitated with an agarose-immobilized anti-FLAG antibody as described previously (27.Ogiso Y. Sugiura R. Kamo T. Yanagiya S. Lu Y. Okazaki K. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. To the washed beads, 0.4 ml of lysates from the Δcnb1 cells expressing both Ppb1 and Cnb1, Ppb1 alone, or Ppb1ΔC alone were added together with 2 μg of bovine calmodulin and CaCl2 (final concentration 5 mm), and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by washing three times with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and by resuspension in an SDS sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, the complexes were evaluated by immunoblot analysis. Microscopic Analysis—Cells were grown to exponential phase in YPD or EMM medium and shifted to various conditions as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0), stained with Hoechst 33342 or Calcofluor to visualize the DNA or septum, respectively, and examined microscopically. For F-actin staining, cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min (28.Balasubramanian M.K. McCollum D. Gould K.L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and 1 μlof100 μg/ml rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was added to 50 μl of the fixed cell suspension. After 30 min at room temperature, the excess phalloidin was washed away with the saline. Cells were examined under an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Photographs were taken with a SPOT2 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Images were processed with the CorelDraw software (Corel Corporation Inc.). Identification of the S. pombe cnb1+Gene—A BLAST program search using the peptide sequence of Cnb1 (YKL190W), the regulatory subunit of calcineurin of S. cerevisiae (29.Kuno T. Tanaka H. Mukai H. Chang C.D. Hiraga K. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30.Cyert M.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3460-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), against the S. pombe protein data base at the Sanger Center revealed an open reading frame, SPCC830.06, which except for the N- and C-terminal domains, exhibits a significant similarity to the budding yeast Cnb1 (score = 680, p = 8.7e–69, identities = 142/174 (81%)). Hence, we named the gene cnb1+. As shown in Fig. 1A, the cnb1+ gene encodes a protein of 174 amino acids that contains four EF-hands. The cnb1 Knock-out Cells Showed Phenotypes Identical to Those of the Knock-out Cells of the Catalytic Subunit Ppb1—To further investigate the cnb1+ gene function, we analyzed the Δcnb1 cells for phenotypes exhibited by the knock-out cells of the catalytic subunit, Ppb1, such as hypersensitivity to the Cl– ion and aberrant cell morphology (7.Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The growth of the Δcnb1 or Δppb1 cells was markedly inhibited by the presence of MgCl2 in the media. Both Δcnb1 cells and Δppb1 cells barely grew in the presence of 0.1 m MgCl2, and both failed to grow in the presence of 0.12 m MgCl2 on the YPD plate (Fig. 1B). Thus, the Cl– sensitivity of the Δcnb1 cells was nearly equal to that of the Δppb1 cells. Notably, the Cl– sensitivity of the Δppb1Δcnb1 double knock-out cells was also nearly equal to their single knock-out cells (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that cnb1+ gene is required for the calcineurin activity in vivo. Microscopic analysis also revealed that the Δppb1, Δcnb1, and Δppb1Δcnb1 cells showed identical cell morphology with enlarged, multiseptated, and branched cells (Fig. 2). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, the MgCl2 sensitivity of the Δcnb1 cells was suppressed by multicopy expression of the pmp1+ gene encoding a MAP kinase phosphatase, which dephosphorylates Pmk1, and were also suppressed by multicopy expression of the unphosphorylatable form of Pek1, an upstream kinase of Pmk1, to the same extent as that of the Δppb1 cells (10.Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results also support the notion that Cnb1 is required for the calcineurin activity in vivo and that calcineurin acts antagonistically with the Pmk1 MAP kinase in Cl– ion homeostasis (10.Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11.Sugiura R. Toda T. Dhut S. Shuntoh H. Kuno T.

Nature. 2003; 424: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cnb1 Specifically Binds Ppb1—The Δppb1 cells expressing the GFP-Ppb1 fusion protein and the Δcnb1 cells expressing the GST-Cnb1 fusion protein grew in YPD medium containing 0.15 m MgCl2, suggesting that these fusion proteins are fully functional (Fig. 4A). In the GST pull-down assay, GFP-Ppb1 associates with GST-Cnb1 but not with unfused GST (Fig. 4B), confirming a protein-protein interaction between these two subunits. Overexpression of the Catalytic Subunit of Calcineurin or Its “Constitutively Active” Mutant Failed to Suppress the Phenotypes of the cnb1 Knock-out—With the availability of the cnb1 knock-out strain, we first tested whether overexpression of the full-length catalytic subunit Ppb1 or its mutated version has any effect on the cnb1 knock-out phenotypes in vivo. We controlled the expression levels of Ppb1 and Cnb1 by a series of expression vectors with the nmt1 promoters pREP1, pREP41, or pREP81 wherein the transcription is repressed in the presence of thiamine (31.Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). pREP1 contains the wild-type nmt1 promoter with a very potent transcriptional activity, thereby causing overproduction. On the other hand, pREP41 and pREP81 possess mutations in their promoter sequences resulting in an intermediate and a most attenuated promoter activity, respectively. When a gene is subcloned into pREP1, the expression level in the absence of thiamine is expected to be about 20,000 times higher than that of the same gene subcloned into pREP81 in the presence of thiamine (24.Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Consistent levels of the tagged Ppb1 or Cnb1 proteins were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 5, A and B). As shown in Fig. 5C, Δppb1 cells that harbored the pREP81 plasmid containing the ppb1+ gene grew on an EMM plate with 0.2 m MgCl2 in the presence of thiamine (pR81–, promoter OFF). On the other hand, Δcnb1 cells that harbored the pREP1 plasmid containing the ppb1+ gene barely grew in the presence of 0.1 m MgCl2 in the absence of thiamine (Fig. 5D, pR1–, promoter ON), and they failed to grow on the plate containing 0.15 m MgCl2. Their growth defect in the presence of MgCl2 was identical with those of the Δcnb1 cells harboring vector. This indicates that the huge amount of the catalytic protein, Ppb1, has no physiological function without its regulatory partner. It is thought that the C-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit has an autoinhibitory function to the phosphatase activity; hence the C-terminal-deleted calcineurin is used as a constitutively active mutant (10.Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15.Lu Y. Sugiura R. Yada T. Cheng H. Sio S.O. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18.Hirayama S. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Maeda T. Kawagishi K. Yokoyama M. Tohda H. Giga-Hama Y. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol.

Genetics. 2002; 161: 971-981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then tested whether the C-terminal-deleted Ppb1ΔC can suppress the MgCl2 sensitivity of the Δcnb1 cells. As shown in Fig. 5D, the Δcnb1 cells overexpressing Ppb1ΔC by the pREP1 vector (pR1–) barely grew in the presence of 0.1 m MgCl2, and they failed to grow on the plate containing 0.15 m MgCl2. The growth defect in the presence of MgCl2 was identical with those of the Δcnb1 cells harboring vector or full-length Ppb1. This indicates that Ppb1ΔC has no physiological enzymatic activity in the absence of the regulatory subunit in vivo. Together, overexpression of either full-length Ppb1 or Ppb1ΔC failed to complement the cnb1 knock-out. Consistently, the dephosphorylation-induced mobility shift of the calcineurin substrate Prz1 (18.Hirayama S. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Maeda T. Kawagishi K. Yokoyama M. Tohda H. Giga-Hama Y. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18078-18084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was observed when it was incubated with both Ppb1 and Cnb1 in the mixture containing calmodulin and Ca2+, but this shift was not observed when it was incubated with either Ppb1 or Ppb1ΔC alone in the same reaction mixture (Fig. 5E). Co-overexpression of Full-length Ppb1 and Cnb1 Only Partially Antagonized the Effect of FK506—Next, we examined the effect of co-overexpression of full-length Ppb1 and Cnb1 on the FK506-induced Cl– sensitivity of wild-type cells. As shown in Fig. 6 (lower panel), the wild-type cells overexpressing the full-length ppb1+ gene chromosomally borne under the control of the nmt1 promoter could not grow on an EMM plate containing FK506 and 0.15 m MgCl2. When Cnb1 was co-expressed with full-length Ppb1 using the pREP1 or pREP41 expression vectors, the cells were able to grow in the presence of FK506 and 0.15 m MgCl2 in a Cnb1 expression-dependent manner (Fig. 6, lower panel). The ability of the co-overexpression of full-length Ppb1 and Cnb1 to suppress the FK506-induced Cl– sensitivity suggested that the immunophilin-drug complex targets the calcineurin holoenzymes. However, the suppression was only partial. Wild-type cells failed to grow in the presence of FK506 and 0.2 m MgCl2 even when both full-length Ppb1 and Cnb1 were co-overexpressed using the pREP1 vector. Notably, the growth of FKBP12-deleted cells (Δfkh1) was not affected by the presence of FK506 in the medium. These results suggest that an excess amount of the full-length Ppb1-Cnb1 complex cannot compete out the FKBP12-FK506 complex. Hyperactivity of Calcineurin Caused Growth Arrest and Aberrant Cell Morphology—From the above results, it is noted that the effect of calcineurin hyperactivity was seen when both the catalytic and the regulatory subunits were overproduced at the same time. To further examine this effect, the wild-type cells with the full-length (ppb1+) or truncated (ppb1ΔC) genes chromosomally borne under the control of the nmt1 promoter were transformed with pREP1-cnb1+ or pREP41-cnb1+ in the presence of thiamine, and the transformants were shifted to the media without thiamine to induce gene expression. It should be noted that there was only a slight difference between the amounts of the Ppb1 and Ppb1ΔC protein expressed in the cells (Fig. 5A). Co-overexpression of Cnb1 and Ppb1ΔC caused a distinct growth defect as shown in Fig. 7, A and C. FK506 reversed the growth defect when Cnb1 was co-overexpressed using an attenuated nmt1 promoter (pREP41-cnb1+), but FK506 failed to reverse the growth defect when Cnb1 was co-overexpressed using the wild-type nmt1 promoter (pREP1-cnb1+). These results suggest that an excess amount of the Cnb1-Ppb1ΔC complex can compete out the FKBP12-FK506 complex. Together, the findings that an excess amount of the Cnb1-Ppb1 full-length complex cannot compete out the FKBP12-FK506 complex and that an excess amount of the Cnb1-Ppb1ΔC complex can compete out the FKBP12-FK506 complex suggest that the FKBP12-FK506 complex selectively binds to calcineurin in its active state. Notably, co-overexpression of Cnb1 and full-length Ppb1 caused no growth defect, suggesting that the activity of the enzyme is tightly regulated by calmodulin and the intracellular Ca2+ ion in its in vivo physiological condition. As shown in Fig. 7B, the arrested cells showed aberrant morphology, such as round, small, bent, or pear-shaped cells (Fig. 7B, DIC). Although the septum was the only structure that was strongly stained by Calcofluor in wild-type cells (data not shown), the aberrant structure probably derived from the cell wall was strongly stained in the arrested cells (Fig. 7B, CF). In addition, the arrested cells showed depolarized distribution of cortical F-actin patches and an abnormally concentrated structure that contains F-actin (Fig. 7B). The aberrant morphology caused by co-overexpression of Ppb1ΔC and Cnb1 was suppressed by the addition of FK506 to the media (Fig. 7B, lower panel), suggesting that hyperactivity of calcineurin also causes the aberrant morphology. As mentioned, the results of our previous study have suggested that calcineurin activates at least two distinct signaling branches, one of which is Prz1-dependent transcriptional regulation (18.Hirayama S. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Maeda T. Kawagishi K. Yokoyama M. Tohda H. Giga-Hama Y. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18078-18084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To examine whether the growth arrest caused by the functional hyperactivity of calcineurin is mediated by the activation of the zinc finger transcription factor Prz1 (18.Hirayama S. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Maeda T. Kawagishi K. Yokoyama M. Tohda H. Giga-Hama Y. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18078-18084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), Δprz1 cells with the truncated (ppb1ΔC) gene chromosomally borne under the control of the nmt1 promoter (KP1746) were transformed with pREP1-cnb1+ or pREP41-cnb1+ in the presence of thiamine, and the transformants were shifted to the media without thiamine to induce gene expression. Co-overexpression of Ppb1ΔC and Cnb1 in Δprz1 cells, as shown in Fig. 7C, did not cause the growth arrest that was observed in the wild-type cells, indicating that it is mediated by the activation of Prz1. As this defect was not suppressed by the FK506 treatment, these results suggest that hyperactivity of calcineurin caused the growth defect and likewise support the notion that the FKBP12-FK506 complex selectively binds to calcineurin in its active state. In the present study, a molecular genetic approach was conducted to examine the in vivo functions of the calcineurin subunits in fission yeast as a simple model system. Here we report that the regulatory subunit is essential for the activation of calcineurin in vivo, and our results suggest that the FKBP12-FK506 complex selectively binds calcineurin in its active state and inhibits the activity in vivo. Calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated type 2B protein phosphatase, is a heterodimer of the catalytic (calcineurin A, Ppb1 in S. pombe) and the regulatory (calcineurin B, Cnb1 in S. pombe) subunits. The catalytic subunit of calcineurin shows a high sequence homology to the catalytic subunit of other protein phosphatases, types 1, 2A, and 5, and some of these catalytic subunits are reported to have functional enzymatic activity in the absence of their regulatory subunits (33.Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Higuchi et al. (34.Higuchi S. Tamura J. Giri P.R. Polli J.W. Kincaid R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18104-18112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a recombinant catalytic A subunit of Neurospora crassa expressed in bacteria was stimulated 2–3-fold by calmodulin and was shown to have a p-nitrophenol phosphatase activity equal to that of the bovine brain calcineurin holoenzyme. Their findings suggest that the catalytic subunit of the fungal calcineurin can exhibit high activity in the absence of its regulatory subunit. On the other hand, biochemical studies using a baculovirus-expressed mammalian catalytic subunit showed that the catalytic subunit alone has very low activity, and the regulatory subunit markedly increased the activity by lowering the Km value (19.Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Brickey D.A. Saitoh Y. Ushio Y. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15965-15969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to answer the question of whether the catalytic subunit has functional activity in the absence of the regulatory subunit in vivo. Here we demonstrate for the first time that the regulatory subunit is absolutely required for the full activation of calcineurin in vivo by showing that neither the overexpression of Ppb1 nor that of the constitutively active form, Ppb1ΔC, can suppress the phenotypes of the cnb1 knock-out. As the stability or subcellular localization of Ppb1 was not affected by the presence or absence of Cnb1 (data not shown), our results suggest that the regulatory subunit is required for the conformational change to the active state after Ca2+/calmodulin binding. Failure of Ppb1ΔC in suppressing the phenotypes of the cnb1 knock-out indicates that the removal of the C-terminal inhibitory domain (35.Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) is not sufficient to activate the enzyme and to dephosphorylate its physiological substrates. We, as well as other researchers, have been using the C-terminal-deleted catalytic subunit of calcineurin (Ppb1ΔC, in the present study) as a constitutively active form to characterize the effects observed with the activation of calcineurin in various organisms and cells, and this has worked very well (36.O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Our present results indicate that these effects are dependent and limited by the presence and amount of the endogenous regulatory subunit, respectively. That is, the truncated version of the calcineurin catalytic subunit works only when it makes a complex with the pre-existing regulatory subunit. Upon overexpression, the truncated catalytic subunit may dominate the endogenous wild-type catalytic subunit, and part of the endogenous regulatory subunit will form a constitutively active complex with the truncated catalytic subunit. This complex may account for the effect obtained with overexpression of the constitutively active form. In the present study, the wild-type cells treated with FK506 showed MgCl2 sensitivity, whereas the FKBP12-deleted (Δfkh1) cells were not affected by the presence of FK506 in the medium. These results indicate that the FKPB12/FK506 immunophilin-drug complex binds and inhibits calcineurin that is required for Cl– homeostasis, thereby causing the FK506-induced Cl– sensitivity. Our results also suggest that neither Ppb1 nor Cnb1 alone can bind the FKBP12-FK506 complex and that only the Ppb1-Cnb1 complex can bind the inhibitor complex. Notably, wild-type cells co-overexpressing full-length Ppb1 and Cnb1 failed to grow in the presence of FK506 and 0.2 m MgCl2, whereas Δfkh1 cells grew in the same medium, indicating that even though the amount of overproduced full-length Ppb1 and Cnb1 may be considerably higher than that of endogenous FKBP12; however, the excess amount of full-length Ppb1 and Cnb1 cannot compete out the FKPB12/FK506 complex, thereby suggesting that the FKBP12-FK506 complex selectively binds and inhibits the active Ppb1-Cnb1-calmodulin-Ca2+ complex in vivo. Consistently, knock-out of the Prz1 transcription factor but not FK506 treatment suppressed the growth defect caused by co-overexpression of Ppb1ΔC and Cnb1 using pREP1-cnb1+ and a potent wild-type nmt1 promoter. These results suggest that an excess amount of the Ppb1ΔC-Cnb1 complex can compete out the FKBP12-FK506 complex. A biochemical study by Clipstone et al. (21.Clipstone N.A. Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26431-26437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the regulatory subunit but not calmodulin is required for the binding of calcineurin to the drug-immunophilin complex, and calcineurin activity has not been correlated with its binding to the complex. However, in our previous in vitro binding study using a rapid filtration assay, we showed that the FKBP12-FK506 complex binds the calcineurin-calmodulin-Ca2+ complex but does not bind to the calcineurin-calmodulin-Mg2+ complex (37.Asami M. Kuno T. Mukai H. Tanaka C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting the correlation between calcineurin activity and its binding to the FKBP12-FK506 complex. In addition, we showed that although the calcineurin-Ca2+ complex binds the FKBP12-FK506 complex, its binding affinity was ∼8 times lower than that of the calcineurin-calmodulin-Ca2+ complex (37.Asami M. Kuno T. Mukai H. Tanaka C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that the in vivo pharmacological target of the FKBP12-FK506 complex is the active calcineurin-calmodulin-Ca2+ complex. Although the assembly of a calcineurin-FKBP12-FK506 complex was established by crystallographic studies (38.Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), our studies suggest that the structure of the calcineurin-calmodulin-FKBP12-FK506-Ca2+ complex needs to be clarified to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of drug action.

We studied the binding of short motif-bearing peptides to ClpA, the chaperone component of the ATP-dependent ClpAP protease of Escherichia coli in the presence of ATPγS and Mg2+ at pH 7.5. Binding was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using the peptide, AANDENYALAA, which corresponds to the SsrA degradation motif found at the C terminus of abnormal nascent polypeptides in vivo. One SsrA peptide was bound per hexamer of ClpA with an association constant (KA) of 5 × 106 m–1. Binding was also assayed by changes in fluorescence of an N-terminal dansylated SsrA peptide, which bound with the same stoichiometry of one per ClpA hexamer (KA ∼ 1 × 107 m–1). Similar results were obtained when ATP was substituted for ATPγS at 6 °C. Two additional peptides, derived from the phage P1 RepA protein and the E. coli HemA protein, which bear different substrate motifs, were competitive inhibitors of SsrA binding and bound to ClpA hexamers with KA′ > 3 × 107 m–1. DNS-SsrA bound with only slightly reduced affinity to deletion mutants of ClpA missing either the N-terminal domain or the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain, indicating that the binding site for SsrA lies within the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain. Because only one protein at a time can be unfolded and translocated by ClpA hexamers, restricting the number of peptides initially bound should avoid nonproductive binding of substrates and aggregation of partially processed proteins.

Molecular chaperones of the Clp/Hsp100 family are key components of cellular protein quality control systems and play an important role in homeostatic mechanisms governing the levels of global regulatory proteins, particularly in response to stress and other environmental signals (1.Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Clp chaperones have an ATP-dependent protein unfolding activity that is employed for disaggregation, structural remodeling, or degradation depending on the functional partners with which they interact (2.Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 3.Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S.

ClpB/Hsp104 proteins act primarily to disrupt protein aggregates and hand misfolded proteins over to the DnaK/Hsp70 chaperone system for refolding (5.Zolkiewski M. J. Biol.

ClpY (HslU) functions similarly to ClpA and ClpX, delivering substrates to the proteasome-like ClpQ (HslV) for degradation (10.Kwon A.R. Trame C.B. McKay D.B. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The protein binding and enzymatic activities of Clp chaperones require assembly into homomeric rings of six subunits (2.Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 11.Horwich A.L. Weber-Ban E.U. Finley D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11033-11040Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The rings are internally dynamic in response to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, which provide a means of exerting the forces necessary to structurally disrupt and translocate protein substrates. The proteolytic holoenzyme complexes of ClpAP and ClpXP are barrel-like structures with a core composed of the double heptameric ring of ClpP, with hexameric rings of ClpA or ClpX stacked coaxially on each end of ClpP (12.Kessel M.

The center of ClpP is a hollow aqueous chamber housing the proteolytic active sites (14.Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Substrates bind to ClpA or ClpX on the ends of the complex, are unfolded, and are then translocated into the ClpP chamber. The specificity of interaction between Clp chaperones and their intended targets is a crucial aspect of their function in vivo and is best understood with the ClpAP and ClpXP systems of Escherichia coli. ClpA and ClpX each target a unique set of proteins by recognizing different specific-sequence motifs located in accessible regions of the target proteins, most often within 15 amino acids of the N or C terminus (15.Levchenko I.

Substrate recognition is further affected by adaptor proteins that bind to the target protein and to the Clp chaperone and mediate or modulate their interaction. Adaptors are specific for particular motifs or classes of proteins and appear to increase the specificity of interaction with a particular chaperone. For example, ClpA and ClpX can directly recognize SsrA-tagged proteins; however, interaction of SsrA-tagged proteins with ClpX is further promoted by the adaptor, SspB, with the consequence that SsrA-tagged proteins are primarily targeted by ClpXP in vivo (20.Wah D.A. Levchenko I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21.Dougan D.A. Weber-Ban E. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins also offer an additional level of cellular regulation, which can serve to govern targeting of substrates under specific physiological conditions, as in the case of the adaptor, RssB, which mediates degradation of the stationary phase sigma factor, RpoS, by ClpXP only when RssB is phosphorylated in response to specific environmental or intracellular signals (22.Zhou Y. Gottesman S. Hoskins J.R. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 23.Hengge-Aronis R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The substrate engagement and motif binding sites on ClpA and ClpX are not known with certainty. Studies with the substrate protein, RepA, indicate that approximately one RepA dimer binds per hexamer of ClpA (24.Pak M. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4901-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and electron microscopic imaging shows the protein bound at the apical ring surface of the chaperone in the vicinity of the axial channel (25.Ortega J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4938-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Tight substrate binding requires assembly of the hexamer for both ClpX and ClpA. Because each ClpA or ClpX subunit is identical, there are potentially six sites in the hexamer for interaction with sequence motifs present in substrates. Thus, several questions about peptide and protein interactions arise. Is binding limited strictly by steric constraints on accessibility to the peptide binding sites? Are all peptide sites identical and equally accessible? Are there separate sites for the different motifs, or are there alternate conformations of the same site that vary in specificity? Do substrate motifs and adaptor motifs bind at separate and distinct sites? Is there cooperativity in binding for identical or different motifs or between substrate and adaptor motifs? To address these issues, we have studied the binding of several relatively small peptides bearing motifs recognized by either ClpA or ClpX. We show that hexameric ClpA and ClpX bind only one peptide with high affinity and that peptides with different motifs bind at the same site or at overlapping sites.

Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer using the FAST-MOC procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. Peptides were purified by reverse phase chromatography on C8 or C18 columns using acetonitrile gradient elution. Peptide identity and purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. N-terminally dansylated peptides were made by addition of dansyl chloride after the final cycle of synthesis of the peptides prior to removal from the resin.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity obtained was 10–20,000 cpm/μg. Protein and peptide concentrations were determined by UV absorption employing a ClpA6 extinction coefficient of 0.40 (mg/ml)–1 cm–1 at 280 nm. A slight discrepancy in DNS-SsrA concentration used for the Job analysis occurred because the extinction coefficient of DNS-SsrA in organic solvent (4000 m–1 cm–1 at 340 nm) was used in that experiment. Subsequently, the extinction coefficient of DNS-SsrA in Buffer A was determined to be 3800 m–1 cm–1 at 340 nm. Extinction coefficients of unlabeled peptides were calculated from their amino acid composition by the method of Gill and von Hippel (30.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were measured at 20 °C with the Hewlett-Packard spectrophotometer model 8453. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Peptides used in titration calorimetry experiments were dialyzed overnight in Buffer A, using 1000 MWCO Spectra/Por DispoLyzers (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA). Proteins were passed over small Sephadex G-50 columns to equilibrate with the dialysate buffer. Peptide and protein solutions were degassed prior to each experiment, and ATPγS was added to both solutions to a final concentration of 2 mm. ITC titrations were performed in the temperature range from 4 to 28 °C using the VP-ITC (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) equipped with a 300-μl injection syringe rotating at 260 rpm. Peptides at the concentration of ∼80 μm were loaded into the syringe and injected in 5-μl volumes at 400- to 600-s intervals into a 1.4-ml cell containing ClpA6 protein (1.7–2.2 μm). Data collection and analysis were performed with Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) using the model for a single class of binding sites. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence spectra were obtained using an AB2 (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) or a QM-6SE (PTI, Inc., London, Ontario) spectrofluorometer. Protein was diluted into Buffer A containing 1 mm ATPγS, and measurements were recorded in 100-μl quartz cells. Sample temperature was maintained at 28 °C unless stated otherwise, by circulating water through jacketed cuvette or with a Peltier sample holder. All spectral measurements were performed with Glan polarizers at magic angle conditions. For DNS fluorescence measurements, the excitation wavelength was set at 340 nm, and the emission wavelength was set at 540 nm. To calculate KA values, fluorescence intensities at 540 nm were read from spectra and corrected for the fluorescence intensity of the probe in the absence of the protein to obtain ΔF. In titration experiments, measurements were corrected for sample dilution, which did not exceed 10%. Using Origin software (OriginLab), ΔF values were fitted to Equation 1 (31.Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) assuming a single binding site, ΔF=KA[L]ΔFmax/(1+KA[L]) (Eq. 1) In Equation 1, ΔFmax is the maximum fluorescence signal change at saturating ligand concentration, and [L] is the free ligand concentration which can be determined from the Equation 2, [L] 2+[L]([M] 0−[L] 0+1/KA)+[L] 0/KA=0 (Eq. 2) where [M]0 and [L]0 are total protein and ligand concentration, respectively. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed by simultaneous measurements of the two polarization components in two emission channels of the PTI spectrofluorometer. The same double detection setup was used to simultaneously monitor DNS fluorescence and light scattering intensity of the protein sample in oligomerization experiments. DNS photostability under experimental conditions was confirmed by a 3-h illumination with fluorescence monitoring without observed intensity change. Binding of dansyl alone or dansyl alanine to ClpA6 was not detected. The fluorescence signal from dansylated peptides did not change upon addition of nucleotide or unlabeled ligands. All steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed after time-dependent changes had occurred, usually < 30 s. For competition binding experiments using nonfluorescent ligands, 0.5 μm dansylated SsrA peptide was equilibrated with 0.5 μm ClpA6 and 1–2 mm ATPγS in buffer A at 28 °C. Unlabeled competitor peptide was then titrated into the cuvette, and the loss in dansyl fluorescence was monitored to follow DNS-SsrA displacement by the competitor. Fluorescence intensity values were corrected for sample dilution and contribution of the unbound fraction of DNS-SsrA at each point of the titration. Corrected data were normalized to the limiting fluorescence intensity values, where 0 corresponds to the fluorescence intensity of 0.5 μm DNS-SsrA in the absence of ClpA6, and 1 to the fluorescence intensity of 0.5 μm DNS-SsrA saturated with protein. The saturation value was established in a separate experiment. The free competing ligand concentrations at half saturation [Cfree]½ were calculated from [Ctotal]½ values obtained from data plots. The [Cfree]½ value was used to calculate the competing peptide affinity constant K2 from Equation 3, ν=nK1C1/(1+K1C1+K2C2) (Eq. 3) where ν is the average saturation of n binding sites with ligand (which is one in this case); C2 is a concentration of the competitor; and K1 and C1 are affinity constant and concentration of the fluorescent ligand, respectively. Dynamic Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering data were obtained using the DynaPro-MS/X with Peltier temperature controller (Protein Solutions/Proterion Corp.) Samples were spun directly before each measurement performed in a 12-μl quartz cuvette in the temperature range from 4 to 50 °C. Dynamic light scattering correlation curves were analyzed using a program supplied with the instrument. In the presence of 1 mm ATPγS, ClpA was hexameric in the temperature range of 6 to 40 °C. Above 40 °C, some aggregation occurred and at 50 °C, the protein precipitated. The ClpA Hexameric Ring Binds One SsrA Peptide—A synthetic 11-amino acid peptide (AANDENYALAA), corresponding to the SsrA degradation tag co-translationally added to stalled nascent polypeptide chains in vivo (32.Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), was used to monitor peptide binding to ClpA by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Fig. 1). Binding was measured in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm ATPγS, which promotes formation of ClpA hexamers ClpA6 (33.Maurizi M.R. Singh S.K. Thompson M.W. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7778-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering confirmed that ClpA6 was assembled under these conditions and remained stable at temperatures from 4 to 40 °C. Peptide titrations were performed at several temperatures between 4 and 28 °C; representative ITC titrations at 10 and 28 °C are shown in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. ITC data were fitted well to a model for a single class of binding sites. Higher molar ratios of SsrA peptide to ClpA6 than shown in Fig. 1 (A and B) gave no evidence for a second set of lower affinity binding sites. In each case, the results were consistent with tight binding of one SsrA peptide to ClpA6, with an average KA′ of 5 × 106m–1 (KD of 0.2 μm) (Fig. 1). The binding of SsrA to ClpA6 in Tris buffer is an endothermic process at 10 °C and exothermic at 28 °C. Thermodynamic parameters obtained from the analysis of ITC titration data are presented in Table I.Table IThermodynamics parameters for SsrA peptide binding to ClpA6LigandBufferaBuffer contained 50 mm Tris or 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, as indicated, and 0.1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATPγS.TΔG′ΔH′KA′ × 10−6NbPeptide bound per ClpA hexamer.°Ckcal/molm−1SsrATris4-6.320 ± 0.20.1 ± 0.21 ± 0.2Tris10-7.918 ± 31.2 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.2Tris15-8.36 ± 12 ± 11.1 ± 0.2Tris20-9.1-4 ± 0.26 ± 21.2 ± 0.2Tris28-9.3-5 ± 0.36 ± 21.0 ± 0.2MOPS10-9.33 ± 116 ± 101.2 ± 0.2MOPS28-20cA very small amount of heat was exchanged in MOPS at 28 °C, and thus the variance in the data was somewhat higher under these conditions.-0.7 ± 1cA very small amount of heat was exchanged in MOPS at 28 °C, and thus the variance in the data was somewhat higher under these conditions.20 ± 10cA very small amount of heat was exchanged in MOPS at 28 °C, and thus the variance in the data was somewhat higher under these conditions.0.8 ± 0.2cA very small amount of heat was exchanged in MOPS at 28 °C, and thus the variance in the data was somewhat higher under these conditions.DNS-SsrATris12-9.24 ± 0.211 ± 31.2 ± 0.2Tris28-9.7-2 ± 0.211 ± 31.2 ± 0.2α-SsrATris6-9.144 ± 214 ± 20.9 ± 0.2Tris10-9.232 ± 212 ± 30.9 ± 0.2Tris18-9.36 ± 0.210 ± 20.9 ± 0.2a Buffer contained 50 mm Tris or 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, as indicated, and 0.1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATPγS.b Peptide bound per ClpA hexamer.c A very small amount of heat was exchanged in MOPS at 28 °C, and thus the variance in the data was somewhat higher under these conditions. Open table in a new tab Injections of SsrA into ClpA solutions in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 1C) yielded ITC signals similar to those obtained when the peptide was titrated into Buffer A alone (Fig. 1D). In addition, in buffer alone or buffer with unassembled ClpA, the small signal accompanying each injection was proportional to the amount of peptide added up to a final concentration of 10 μm SsrA. The absence of any saturatable peptide concentration-dependent change in ITC signal is evidence against significant binding of SsrA to unassembled ClpA and suggests that SsrA binds tightly to ClpA only after assembly the hexamer. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔH′, –TΔS′, and ΔG′) for binding of SsrA to ClpA6 are shown as a function of temperature in Fig. 1E and Table I. Values of ΔH′ are small and decrease with increasing temperature, becoming slightly negative at ∼21 °C. To quantitate proton uptake or release upon binding of SsrA to ClpA, titrations were repeated at 10 and 28 °C using 20 mm MOPS buffer, which has a much lower heat of protonation than Tris (ΔΔH = –5.9 kcal/mol). At both temperatures, there were differences in the enthalpies of SsrA binding to ClpA6 measured in MOPS or Tris buffer. The changes in binding enthalpy and in the temperature dependence of binding enthalpy obtained between the two buffers are consistent with a net uptake of two protons at 10 °C and a net release of one proton at 28 °C. The difference in proton uptake at the two temperatures suggests that ClpA is in different conformational states at 10 and 28 °C. After correction for the heat of protonation of the buffer, the enthalpy of binding between SsrA and ClpA6 at 10 and 28 °C were –7.3 and +6.0 kcal mol–1, respectively (dashed line for ΔH, Fig. 1E). Using these values of ΔH and the ΔG′ value derived from the average association constant of 5 × 106 m–1, the calculated –TΔS values at 10 and 28 °C were –1.4 and –15.1 kcal K–1 mol–1, respectively. Thus, the binding of SsrA to ClpA6 is enthalpically controlled at 10 °C and entropically controlled at 28 °C. The crossover point at which both ΔH and –TΔS make equal contribution to ΔG′ occurs at about 14 °C. The change in binding enthalpy with temperature is related to the change in heat capacity by Equation 4, and therefore the slope of the line obtained when ΔH (corrected for buffer-proton interaction) is plotted versus temperature, where Equation 4, ΔH=ΔH0+ΔCp(T−T0) (Eq. 4) provides the change in heat capacity (ΔCp) upon formation of the protein-ligand complex. For SsrA binding to ClpA, the ΔCp was determined to be +740 cal mol–1 K–1. The rather small, positive heat capacity change upon binding of SsrA suggests that there is no net burial of apolar surfaces on peptide binding to ClpA, although there may be solvent rearrangement and burial of surface polar residues. The enthalpy of binding in Buffer A decreased with increasing temperature for several modified species of SsrA peptides as well (Table I), indicating that the binding interactions between the different peptides and ClpA6 share similar characteristics. Binding of Dansylated SsrA Peptide to ClpA and ClpX—To confirm the stoichiometry and other SsrA binding properties obtained in the ITC experiments, the SsrA peptide with a dansyl moiety attached to the N terminus was used to measure binding by fluorescence methods. Upon binding of DNS-SsrA to ClpA hexamers in the presence of ATPγS, the fluorescence intensity increased and the fluorescence spectrum underwent a hypsochromic shift (Fig. 2). Addition of DNS-SsrA to ClpA in the absence of ATPγS produced only small changes in fluorescence, consistent with poor binding to unassembled ClpA. When ATPγS was added to a mixture of DNS-SsrA and ClpA to promote formation of ClpA hexamers, DNS-SsrA bound to ClpA as indicated by the increase in fluorescence intensity and a shift of the fluorescence emission spectrum (Fig. 2). Thus, the fluorescence properties of the final complex were the same regardless of the order of addition of ClpA and ATPγS. These data indicate that, as seen for unmodified SsrA, tight binding of DNS-SsrA can only occur with the assembled ClpA hexamer. No change was observed when DNS-SsrA was added to nucleotide solutions in the absence of ClpA. Binding to ClpA was dependent on the peptide portion of DNS-SsrA, because no significant changes in fluorescence were observed when either free dansyl chloride or dansylated alanine was added (data not shown). The small fluorescence changes seen with DNS-SsrA and unassembled ClpA were similar to those seen in control experiments with DNS-Ala, indicating that the dansyl moiety itself has some tendency to interact weakly with ClpA. Additional evidence also supports the conclusion that high affinity binding of DNS-SsrA requires the assembled ClpA hexamer. DNS-SsrA binding monitored by changes in fluorescence intensity or anisotropy followed the same time course as ClpA oligomerization, which occurred in <20 s after addition of ATPγS (Fig. 3, A and B). The increase in fluoresc"

Functional genomics can be based on the use of genomic libraries and used as a means for gene or function discovery. These libraries include the now classical cDNA libraries, small interfering RNA libraries, or random peptide libraries. cDNA libraries are based on the natural genetic information of the cell, as it is the genome of the cell that serves as template for library production (Ref. 1Wolkowicz R. Nolan G.P. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: d603-d619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Small interfering RNA libraries are composed of short double-stranded RNA molecules for the knocking down of genes based on RNA interference (2Luo B. Heard A.D. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5494-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3Sen G. Wehrman T.S. Myers J.W. Blau H.M. Nat.

Virus Res. 2004; 102: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Random peptide libraries, in contrast, are composed of a pool of shapes resulting from random, or partially random, DNA sequences that can ultimately result in the translation of specific three-dimensional structures. These peptides may bind to the surfaces of biomolecules and by doing so interfere or alter signaling pathways. The change in biological outcome or phenotype is often the basis for biological screens. The peptide responsible for that outcome becomes the subject of a study aimed at discovering the binding partner in the cell (5Fields S. Song O.

Binder B.R. de Martin R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e80Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), degenerate random libraries such as those based on the major histocompatibility complex class I anchor residues (10Tolstrup A.B. Duch M. Dalum I. Pedersen F.S. Mouritsen S. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and fully random peptide libraries (11Xu X. Leo C. Jang Y. Chan E. Padilla D.

Examples also include random peptides fused to the green fluorescent protein at both termini or protruding internal loops (12Peelle B. Lorens J. Li W. Bogenberger J. Payan D.G. Anderson D.C. Chem.

In this regard, certain eukaryotic viruses have been engineered for eukaryotic protein display. An example is the multiple nuclear polyhedrosis baculovirus Autographa californica. Peptides inserted into, or foreign proteins fused to, the native virus coat protein results in their incorporation onto the surface of the viral particle (14Grabherr R. Ernst W. Oker-Blom C. Jones I. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 231-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Yeast have also been exploited for surface display as they can enable correct folding of many mammalian proteins. Single-chain Fv antibody fragments referred to as intrabodies have been used for library expression in yeast (15der Maur A.A. Zahnd C. Fischer F. Spinelli S. Honegger A. Cambillau C. Escher D. Pluckthun A. Barberis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45075-45085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In some cases, still, the scaffold protein has to be engineered for proper display as the case of the T cell receptor illustrates. The T cell receptor was displayed on the surface only after mutation of specific variable region residues (16Kieke M.C. Shusta E.V. Boder E.T. Teyton L. Wittrup K.D. Kranz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Others have fused single-chain Fv antibody fragment-based combinatorial libraries to the Aga2p mating adhesion receptor (17Boder E.T. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 18Boder E.T. Wittrup K.D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 430-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The biochemical characteristics and nature of proteins depends obviously on the environment in which they are expressed. The milieu heavily influences the three-dimensional structure, the activation status in the case of a catalytic protein, and the posttranslational modifications that the protein will undergo; this is especially relevant in the case of certain glycosylation residues that differ between human and mouse cells. Therefore, the localization and cell-specific expression of the library are critical and will influence the structure of what is displayed.Here, we describe the construction of a peptide library expressed on the surface of mammalian cells. We fused the peptide library to the N terminus of the chemokine receptor CCR5. The CCR5 receptor, as a naturally membrane-localized molecule, is readily expressed in that compartment unless disrupted. A retroviral Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector was used as a vehicle to transfer the library into mammalian cells and integrate it within the genome. The peptide library was constitutively expressed on the cell membrane. A FLAG epitope, purposely incorporated into the library, was readily rescued after the standard process of sorting and amplification as proof of principle. In a further test, a search for a peptide mimicking the FLAG epitope was undertaken, and we demonstrate the rescue of such an epitope from the library following subsequent rounds of sorting and amplification. This form of library could become a useful tool in the search for antibody mimetopes, cancer antigens, autoimmune decoys, adhesion molecules, and blocking agents. By expression of the library on the mammalian cell surface, it can become an attractive tool for biological screenings in more contextual and physiological environments.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneration of Vector-carrying Library—The insert carrying the library was developed as described previously (19Wolkowicz R. Nolan G.P. Curran M.A. Heiser W.C. Methods in Molecular Biology: Gene Delivery to Mammalian Cells. 246. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2004: 391-411Google Scholar). Briefly, a single-stranded DNA template of the form 5′-ATGCGGGCCGGCCGGA(NNK)nGGCGCGCCTGGTTGCGGACCAGGA-3′, where N is an equimolar mixture of all four nucleotides, K is an equimolar mixture of G and T, and n is 9 or 13, was used to prime the reaction with the reverse primer 5′-TGGTCCGCAACCAGGCGCGCC-3′. Following T4 DNA polymerase extension, the resulting double-stranded DNA was purified in a low melting agarose gel (Invitrogen). DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in distilled H2O. The DNA was then subjected to FseI and AscI restriction overnight. DNA was run again in a low melting agarose gel and ethanol purified. One μg of DNA insert was ligated to 5 μg of DNA of FseI and AscI linearized vector with high concentration T4 DNA ligase enzyme (Invitrogen). For the FLAG control peptide, 5′-CCGGAGATTACAAAGATGATGATGATAAGGG-3′ was hybridized to 5′-GGCCGGCCTCTAATGTTTCTACTACTACTATTCCCGCGC-3′ for direct ligation into the linear vector.Infection of Cells with Library-carrying Virus—The viral supernatant carrying the library was produced as described previously (20Swift S. Lorens J. Achacoso P. Nolan G.P. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1999: 14-29Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of a mixture of pMGIB-PL-CCR5-9 and pMGIB-PL-CCR5-13 were used to transfect each of three 10-cm phoenix-e plates using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). A total of 30 ml of viral supernatant was used to infect 3 × 108 supt-1 cells. The cells were distributed in a total of 16 6-well plates with ∼3.1 × 106 cells/well. 300 μl of supernatant and Polybrene at 5 μg/ml final concentration were added to each well. The plates were spun in a swinging bucket rotor centrifuge for 90 min at 1,500 × g and 32 °C. Two days postinfection, when needed, cells were selected with 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Calbiochem) for 10 days.Analysis of Cells for Expression of Library—5 μl of anti-CCR5 antibody coupled to PE 1The abbreviations used are: PE, phycoerythrin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PL, peptide library; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. (Pharmingen) was used to stain 1 × 106 cells. For FLAG staining, anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was coupled to FITC using columns as provided by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). Otherwise, 0.5 μl of biotinylated anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) were used per 1 × 106 cells, washed, and stained with 1 μl of streptavidin-PE. The cells were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScalibur, BD Biosciences).Purification of Genomic DNA—1-5 × 106 cells from each clonal population were spun and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to purify genomic DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol (DNeasy Tissue Kit, Qiagen).PCR Rescue of Peptide Sequence—Genomic DNA from individual clones was used as template. A 5′-AGGACCTTACACAGTCCTGC-3′ oligonucleotide that binds to the packaging signal within the retroviral backbone was used as forward primer. A 5′-TGTCGAGCGGATCGCTCACAA-3′ oligonucleotide that binds within the CCR5 open reading frame was used as reverse primer. Following PCR reaction, the DNA products were analyzed by agarose gel. Relevant DNA bands were extracted (QIAEX II gel extraction kit, Qiagen) and sequenced.RESULTSChoice of Scaffold for Membrane Expression—To express the peptide library on the surface of a mammalian cell, two goals had to be achieved: (1) stable expression of the peptide library in a mammalian cell line; and (2) the efficient expression of the library members on the cell surface. For stable and constitutive expression, a retroviral shuttle vector system was used. For the expression on the surface of a mammalian cell, we chose to express the library as a fusion with an adaptor or scaffold molecule that is expressed on the surface. We tested several different surface expression systems, and the CCR5 system showed the most utility and robustness (data now shown). The scaffold chosen was the CCR5 chemokine receptor of the G-coupled, seven-transmembrane domain family of proteins.As a first step, it was critical to assess the location of library insertion within the CCR5 gene. The signal leader sequence of the chemokine receptor is not well-determined; thus any change at the N terminus of the protein may disrupt the transfer of the mature protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and finally to the outer cell membrane. To locate the peptides of the library in the extracellular compartment of the cell, several sites within the CCR5 receptor were considered. These included the N-terminal region just downstream from the signal sequence and any of the three extracellular loops of the seven-transmembrane domain molecule. We took advantage of a construct (kindly provided by Warner Greene, Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA) that bears an artificial prolactin signal sequence fused to the N terminus of the CCR5 molecule. This construct, based on the pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector, also bears an epitope tag at the point of fusion between the prolactin signal sequence and the CCR5 open reading frame; the sequence is YKDDDDY and is commonly referred to as the FLAG tag (21Prickett K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopp T.P. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar). Because this construct has been previously shown to deliver efficient expression of CCR5 on the cell surface, we chose to introduce the library insert at that same position.Construction of a Random Library—The general scaffold of the peptide sequence was first engineered. We constructed a library with a constrained structure (22Ring C.S. Cohen F.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E.

Biol. 1996; 259: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For that purpose we introduced cysteine-codon residues at both the 5′ and the 3′ termini of the library insert (see Fig. 1B). This would presumably enable disulfide bond formation on the outer membrane and consequently would stabilize loop structure formation in the peptides. Upstream and downstream of each cysteine we incorporated a spacer sequence consisting of glycines, prolines, and alanines; this sequence was expected to impart flexibility to the structure and appropriate separation from the CCR5 molecule. Two restriction enzyme sites were added within the inner spacers to enable the insertion of the random or other desired sequence (see Fig. 1B).The library was constructed according to the method described by Wolkowicz and Nolan (1Wolkowicz R. Nolan G.P. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: d603-d619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A single-stranded DNA template harboring the library sequence was primed with a reverse primer at a constant region. Following polymerization with T4 polymerase and restriction digest, the double-stranded DNA insert was purified. We constructed two libraries, one consisting of a random sequence of 9 codons and a second one with 13 codons. The 9-mer and 13-mer libraries are referred to as PL-CCR5-9 and PL-CCR5-13, respectively. The vector carrying the CCR5 scaffold, pMGIB-CCR5, was ligated to the peptide library (PL) inserts. Bacteria were transformed with the ligation reaction. A titration was performed to characterize the complexity of each library. The complexities obtained from PL-CCR5-9 and PL-CCR5-13 were 6.5 × 107 and 3.0 × 107, respectively. In this study, we used a library containing both peptide lengths (referred to as the mixed library). The functional complexity of this library was around 6.5 × 107. This is due to a theoretical 34% probability of getting a stop codon, according to expectations (1Wolkowicz R. Nolan G.P. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: d603-d619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the control, we have also introduced the FLAG epitope in the same location as that of the random sequence, and it is referred to as fCCR5.Expression of a CCR5 Scaffold via Retroviral Vectors—To express the library in a stable manner within mammalian cells, we used pMGIB, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector (see Fig. 1A). This vector enables the production of virus by transfection into the Phoenix-e packaging cell line (see “Materials and Methods”). The virus produced was collected and used to infect naive Jurkat-e cells. The human Jurkat-e cell line was chosen as it does not naturally express the CCR5 receptor, harbors the ecotropic receptor for murine leukemia virus, and is readily infected by the packaging phoenix-e produced virus that is pseudotyped with the ecotropic murine envelope.Cells were analyzed for the stability of the expression of the library on the surface. We aimed for an infection efficiency of 10-20% to avoid multiple infection events per cell, which would complicate rescue of the peptide of interest in the future. 2 days after infection the cells were analyzed for the rate of infection. The cells were further incubated in the presence of blasticidin for at least 8 days to enrich the population of infected cells. An antibody against the first loop of the CCR5 receptor was used to confirm the expression of CCR5 on the surface of the cell. Fig. 2A shows that although around 13% of the cells were positive for CCR5 before blasticidin selection, upon selection the percentage increased to 59%. This is absolutely in accordance with the functional versus general complexity of the library. Around 34% of the clones infected are resistant to blasticidin but carry stop codons because of the nature of the NNK library (1/32 chance of getting a stop codon) and consequently are not expected to express the CCR5 receptor. More importantly, the pattern of CCR5 expression shows that the introduction of the cysteine-cysteine scaffold did not affect the expression of the CCR5 protein on the surface.Fig. 2Library expression.A, expression pre- and postselection. Uninfected Jurkat-e cells and Jurkat-e cells infected with the pMGIB-PLCCR5-9/13 virus were incubated with α-CCR5-FITC antibody and analyzed by FACS. The analysis of both cell types was done 2 days after infection. Analysis of the cells infected the pMGIB-PL-CCR5-9/13 virus was also performed 10 days after selection with blasticidin. B, expression of fCCR5 and PL-CCR5 on the cell surface. Naive Jurkat-e cells and Jurkat-e-fCCR5- and Jurkat-e-PL-CCR5-9/13-expressing cells were analyzed by FACS for FLAG and CCR5 expression.

Naive Jurkat-e cells were used as control. Jurkat-e, Jurkat-e-fCCR5, and Jurkat-e-PLCCR5 cells were analyzed by FACS for the presence of the receptor on the cell surface (see Fig. 2B). Anti-FLAG and anti-CCR5 antibodies coupled to FITC were used for the analysis. The cells infected with fCCR5 were positive for both FLAG and CCR5 antibodies, as expected. The library-expressing cells are positive only for CCR5 and negative for the FLAG epitope. The parental cell line was negative for both.Screening for a Rare Epitope in a Surface-expressed Library—We then determined whether the library could be screened for a phenotype of interest and whether the peptide responsible for that phenotype could be rescued. For that purpose the construct containing the FLAG epitope was added to the mixed library at a ratio of one FLAG construct to 107 random clones. Because we intended to show that it was possible to rescue this specific peptide when it was present once in 107 peptides actually expressed on the cell surface, 0.1 pg of pMGIB-fCCR5 was mixed with 1.3 mg of the mixed library. This ratio accounted for the presence of stop codons in the library, as described previously (1Wolkowicz R. Nolan G.P. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: d603-d619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mixture of DNA was used to transfect Phoenix-e cells, and the virus produced by them was used to infect Jurkat-e cells. Two hundred million cells were originally screened for binding capacity of the anti-FLAG antibody. To reduce false positive binders, a biotinylated form of the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and a secondary staining consisting of streptavidin coupled to PE were used. Positive populations were subsequently amplified and reanalyzed. This process was repeated three times with both the parental library and that same library into which the FLAG-expressing vector had been diluted. The enrichment factor of FLAG-positive cells in the FLAG-containing library was 10-fold after just one round, 3.6% (Fig. 3, Sort 2). After two rounds (Fig. 3, Sort 3) 10% of the cells were positive. This was in striking contrast with the control library, in which only a slight enrichment factor was observed, at least within the first two rounds.Fig. 3Selection process aimed at recovering the FLAG epitope. The right panels show FACS analysis of cells expressing the mixed original PL-CCR5 library. The left panels show the same analysis with the FLAG-containing PL-CCR5 library. Incubation with anti-FLAG-biotin antibody was followed by incubation with streptavidin-PE. Streptavidin-PE staining alone is shown as a negative control for nonspecific binding.

Fig. 4A shows one of these clones. Genomic DNA was subsequently purified from several of such clones. This DNA was used as a template for PCR rescue of the insert of interest, and DNA product (Fig. 4B) was purified and sequenced, demonstrating that the sequence between the cysteines was indeed the FLAG epitope (Fig. 4C). The success of this selection process gave us confidence that this expression library would be of use in the selection of interesting biomolecules.Fig. 4Rescue of a FLAG epitope.A, FACS analysis of one individual clone rescued and amplified from the third round of selection of cells expressing the FLAG-containing library.

Because an increase in enrichment was observed, although slight (Fig. 3, Sort 3), we repeated the procedure described above consisting of sort and amplification two additional times for a total of four rounds. Within the last sort; i.e. sort 5, we amplified individual clones. The clones were stained as described with biotinylated anti-FLAG antibody and streptavidin-PE and analyzed by FACS. Fig. 5Ashows the clone rescued from sort 5 analyzed by FACS.Fig. 5Rescue of a pseudo-FLAG epitope.A, FACS analysis of one individual clone rescued and amplified from the fifth round of selection of cells expressing the parental library. Incubation with anti-FLAG-biotin antibody was followed by incubation with streptavidin-PE. Streptavidin-PE staining alone is shown as a negative control (-) for nonspecific binding. B, the sequence of the pseudo-FLAG is depicted, with the FLAG sequence underneath for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Genomic DNA from this clone was prepared, and the sequence obtained is shown in Fig. 5B. Interestingly, the rescued sequence NTAAKDDDWLGPT contains the partial FLAG motif KDDD (out of the DYKDDDDY FLAG sequence). We repeatedly demonstrated that cells infected with the sequence showed reproducible increases in staining with the anti-FLAG antibody. Although the affinity of the anti-FLAG antibody to the rescued sequence referred to as “pseudo-FLAG” appeared to be slightly lower than to the consensus FLAG sequence, clear staining was observed (Fig. 5B). Thus, the pseudo-FLAG sequence that we isolated shows clearly that epitope mimics can be detected by this process at low frequency (presumably one per library), successfully enriched, and isolated.DISCUSSIONRandom peptide libraries can be thought of as libraries of shapes. The peptides expressed can affect their immediate surroundings by interacting with existing biomolecules and, as a result, influence signaling cascades or perform other useful functions. This may alter the phenotype of the cell, distinguishing it in a manner that is valuable for a variety of specific purposes. By the application of appropriate screening and selection processes one can find the peptide responsible for the phenotype of interest. Random peptides have been used in the classical approach of phage display as fusion decoys with the P-III protein of filamentous phages. This technology is essentially a refined in vitro system for the study of affinity interactions between a bait molecule and possible candidate partners within the library. Extension of this approach to mammalian cells could be beneficial for such purposes as developing ligands that work only in the context of cell-cell interactions, for instance.Here we have expressed a random peptide library on the surface of mammalian cells. We believe this library will be useful in screens in which intracellular libraries, previously applied (12Peelle B. Lorens J. Li W. Bogenberger J. Payan D.G. Anderson D.C. Chem.

A. 2000; 97: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) cannot be exploited. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by fusing the random peptide sequence at the N terminus of the CCR5 chemokine receptor downstream of the signal sequence of prolactin. Other methods for expression on the cell surface could involve fusion to any natural receptor of choice, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, or an artificial construct containing both a signal sequence for transfer into the endoplasmic reticulum and the membrane and a transmembrane domain for anchoring. Here we have taken a straightforward approach exploiting a naturally occurring receptor as a presentation scaffold.Several considerations were necessary for a successful outcome in the current work. The choice of library insertion within the scaffold is as crucial as is the choice of scaffold itself. A poor insertion site could jeopardize protein expression or transport into the membrane, disrupt conformation, or all of the above. This is especially important when the scaffold protein is a receptor, at which naturally occurring signal sequences at the N terminus of the protein are often needed for transport but lost upon posttranslational modification. The FLAG epitope originally present at the N terminus of CCR5 in the mammalian expression vector gave a potential site for insertion that others observed did not disrupt the CCR5 expression on the surface of the target cell. 2J. Gosling and W. Greene, personal communication. Moreover, the FLAG epitope was a useful control as a known peptide member within the library. The random peptide library insert engineered as a 9-mer or 13-mer was introduced within a cysteine-cysteine scaffold flanked by spacer regions to stabilize loop formation. The FLAG tag"

The contribution of selected side chains of BASI to this high affinity is discerned in this study, and binding to other targets is investigated. Seven BASI residues along the AMY2-BASI interface and four residues in the putative protease-binding loop on the opposite side of the inhibitor were mutated. A total of 15 variants were compared with the wild type by monitoring the α-amylase and protease inhibitory activities using Blue Starch and azoalbumin, respectively, and the kinetics of binding to target enzymes by surface plasmon resonance. Generally, the mutations had little effect on kon, whereas the koff values were increased up to 67-fold. The effects on the inhibitory activity, however, were far more pronounced, and the Ki values of some mutants on the AMY2-binding side increased 2–3 orders of magnitude, whereas mutations on the other side of the inhibitor had virtually no effect.

The newly established heterologous expression system in Escherichia coli (4Bønsager B.C. Prætorius-Ibba M. Nielsen P.K. Svensson B. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 30: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) prompted dissection of the contribution of individual regions and side chains to the overall inhibitory activity of BASI. Another key question addressed is whether the embedded Ca503 and its solvent coordination sphere, as well as other buried solvent molecules, play a significant role in the complex formation and dissociation. This first elaborate mutational analysis of a bifunctional Kunitz-type inhibitor offers insight into the determinants of affinity and the driving forces for complex formation with target enzymes, which paves the way for rational design of other β-trefoil fold family members.

E. coli BL21 was transformed with the modified vectors and selected on ampicillin (100 μg × ml–1) LB plates. Cells grown at 20 °C (0.5 liters) were induced by 4 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 = 0.6, harvested after 24 h by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of intein-CBD tag buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and His6 tag buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl), and sonicated. Intein-CBD tag BASI was applied to a chitin column (2 ml), left in 30 mm dithiothreitol overnight to autohydrolyze (34Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 277-281Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar), eluted by 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.05 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and purified on Superose 12 HP 10/30. His6 tag BASI was purified on a HiTrap HP nickel column (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences), eluted by a 30–500 mm imidazole gradient using an ÄKTAexplorer chromatograph (Amersham Biosciences), and finally purified on Sephacryl S-100 HR (Amersham Biosciences; 60 × 1.6 cm). Optional factor Xa cleavage was performed as described (4Bønsager B.C. Prætorius-Ibba M. Nielsen P.K. Svensson B. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 30: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protein Characterization—SDS-PAGE (4–12%) and isoelectric focusing, pH 3–10 (NOVEX and Invitrogen), were performed as recommended by the manufacturers. Protein concentrations were calculated from amino acid contents of hydrolysates (0.2–1.0 nmol; 6 m HCl, 110 °C, 22 h) determined on a Biochrom 20 analyzer (Amersham Biosciences). Circular dichroism was measured with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter dichrograph at 25 °C. Ten spectra were scanned at 250 to 190 nm by using a quartz cell (path length 1.0 mm) and scaled in the protein concentration range 1.5–5 μm. AMY2 Inhibition—BASI mutants or wild types (12 concentrations in the range 0.3 nm to 3 μm were chosen to match the inhibitory activity) were preincubated with AMY2 (3.2 nm; 400 μl) for 30 min at 37 °C in either 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% bovine serum albumin (optimal for inhibition) or 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 6.8, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.2 m NaCl (suboptimal). The preincubation mixture (200 μl) was added to insoluble Blue Starch (6.25 mg in the corresponding buffer; 800 μl) and incubated at 37 °C. After 30 min, the reaction was stopped by 0.5 m NaOH (250 μl) and centrifuged, and the absorbance was measured at 620 nm (MRX-TC Revelation microtiter plate reader, Dynex Technologies) (2Abe J. Sidenius U. Svensson B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Km values of AMY2 were 1.0 × 10–3 and 1.3 × 10–3 g × ml–1 under optimal and suboptimal conditions, respectively, and 1.6 × 10–3, 1.1 × 10–3, and 2.5 × 10–3 g × ml–1 at ∼1 μm Ca2+ (present in the buffer without CaCl2 addition), 1 mm, and 20 mm CaCl2 (pH 8.0), as determined by fitting rates at seven insoluble Blue Starch concentrations (0.2–5 mg × ml–1) to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Test for Inhibition of Yellow Meal Worm (T. molitor) α-Amylase—Up to 42 μm E168Q, Y170P, E168Q/Y170P, or wild-type BASI and TMA (21 nm) were preincubated at 37 °C (30 min) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin (400 μl); and insoluble Blue Starch was added (6.25 mg in 600 μl). The reaction was stopped after 30 min and activity quantified as for AMY2. Inhibition of Savinase—BASI Y87A, T89A, S93A, E95Q, or wild type (10 concentrations in the range 60 nm to 2 μm) were preincubated with savinase (125 nm; 200 μl) for 20 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Bicine, pH 8.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m KCl, and added azoalbumin (15 mg × ml–1; 200 μl) (13Ohtsubo K-I. Richardson M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped after 45 min by 5% trichloroacetic acid (600 μl), left 30 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was mixed 1:1 with 10% NaOH, and A492 was measured as above. The Km of savinase for azoalbumin was 14 mg × ml–1 as determined from the initial hydrolysis rates at seven substrate concentrations (0.5–12.5 mg × ml–1). Calculation of Ki—Determination of the intrinsic Ki = Ki,app × (1 + S/Km)–1 (36.Bieth, J. (1974) in Bayer-Symposium V “Protein Inhibitors” (Fritz, M., Tschesche, M., Greene, L J., and Truscheit, E., eds) pp. 463–469, Springer-Verlag, BerlinGoogle Scholar) assumed equilibrium between AMY2, BASI, substrate (Blue Starch), and the AMY2-BASI complex. Inhibition curves showed % inhibition, 100 × (1 –(Acti/Act0)) versus BASI:AMY2 (molar ratio); Act0 and Acti are activities in the absence and presence of BASI. Ki,app was obtained from the slope of 1/Acti versus [BASI0]/(1–Acti), using the intercept on the y axis indicated the enzyme concentration (according to Fig. 5 in Ref. 36.Bieth, J. (1974) in Bayer-Symposium V “Protein Inhibitors” (Fritz, M., Tschesche, M., Greene, L J., and Truscheit, E., eds) pp. 463–469, Springer-Verlag, BerlinGoogle Scholar). The Ki value for inhibition of savinase was determined by using the above equations with the appropriate Km values and substrate (azoalbumin). Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding kinetics of BASI and either AMY2 or savinase was determined by using a BIAcore 3000 (Biosensor, Amersham Biosciences) (4Bønsager B.C. Prætorius-Ibba M. Nielsen P.K.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The sensor chips were charged by 300–1000 response units of either biotinylated AMY2 (streptavidin-sensor chips), BASI, or savinase bound by using the amine coupling procedure (CM5 sensor chips) (8Nielsen P.K. Bønsager B.C. Berland C.R. Sigurskjold B.W. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Sensorgrams (response units versus time) in duplicate were recorded at a flow rate of 30 μl × min–1 at 25 °C, using five analyte concentrations (20–300 nm) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% surfactant P20. The effect of Ca2+ was measured in 10 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 0.005% surfactant P20. The association and dissociation were monitored for 4 and 15 min, respectively, and the chip was regenerated by 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (AMY2), or by 5 min of prolonged dissociation (savinase). Sensorgrams were analyzed using BIAevaluation version 3.1 software applying a single site 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model: A + B ⇄ AB) and deriving koff, kon, and KD values (8Nielsen P.K. Bønsager B.C. Berland C.R. Sigurskjold B.W. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Binding energy differences were calculated using ΔΔG = –RT ln(KD,mut/KD,wt) (37Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G.

Three of the four regions were located at the AMY2-BASI interface, and the fourth was on the opposite side of the inhibitor, which is suggested to be involved in protease inhibition. In the case of the AMY2-BASI interface, mutations were focused on two regions of BASI, the first of which is in contact with AMY2 domain B, and the other overlooks the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, one charge-reversed mutation was introduced in a third region of BASI in contact with AMY2 domain A but fairly distant from the active site (Figs. 1 and 2C). In the first region of BASI, Ser77, Tyr131, Lys140, and Asp150, which form various hydrogen bonds to the two previously mutated AMY2 residues Arg128 and Asp142 (Table I; Figs. 2, A and B and 3) and also to Gly144, were replaced mostly by sterically similar side chains (41Bordo D. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Glu168 and Tyr170 were the targets of mutations in the second binding region located at the center of the binding interface. These residues are involved in an extended hydrogen bonding network comprising the hydration shell of the embedded Ca503 and the three AMY2 catalytic groups Asp179, Glu204, and Asp289 (Table I; Fig. 2B). The only AMY2-BASI direct bond involving these residues is between Glu168 in BASI and Lys182 in AMY2 that in turn forms a hydrogen bond to a substrate glucosyl residue at subsite +2 (15Kadziola A. Søgaard M. Svensson B. Haser R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19MacGregor E.A. Janecek S. Svensson B. Biochim. Biophys.

Moreover, Glu168 and Tyr170 correspond to glutamine and proline in the rice homologue RASI (Fig. 3) that inhibits insect α-amylase (13Ohtsubo K-I. Richardson M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the RASI mimics E168Q, Y170P, and E168Q/Y170P were designed to assess if they could confer inhibitory activity on insect α-amylase. In the third region Asp156 (Fig. 2C), located at the periphery of the complex and having only a water-mediated bond to AMY2, was charge-reversed to probe how changes in charge density in that region would affect the binding"
https://openalex.org/W2089985769,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24 regulates polarized growth by binding to Cdc42, a Rho-type GTPase that has many effectors, including Ste20 kinase, which activates multiple MAPK cascades. Here, we show that Cdc24 promotes MAPK signaling during mating through interactions with Ste5, a scaffold that must shuttle through the nucleus and bind to the β subunit (Ste4) of a G protein for Ste20 to activate the tethered MAPK cascade. Ste5 was basally recruited to growth sites of G1 phase cells independently of Ste4. Loss of Cdc24 inhibited nuclear import and blocked basal and pheromone-induced recruitment of Ste5. Ste5 was not basally recruited and the MAPK Fus3 was not basally activated in the presence of a Cdc24 mutant (G168D) that still activates Cdc42, suggesting that Cdc24 regulates Ste5 and the associated MAPK cascade through a function that is not dependent on its guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity. Consistent with this, Cdc24 bound Ste5 and coprecipitated with Ste4 independently of Far1 and Ste5. Loss of Cdc24 decreased Ste5-Ste4 complex formation, and loss of Ste4 stimulated Cdc24-Ste5 complex formation. Collectively, these findings suggest that Cdc24 mediates site-specific localization of Ste5 to a heterotrimeric G protein and may therefore ensure localized activation of the associated MAPK cascade.

Cell polarity underlies differentiation, proliferation, and morphogenesis in single cell and multicellular organisms and occurs through localized activation of Rho-type GTPases that are linked to many different effectors (1.Zheng Y.

A major question is how Rho effectors are selectively activated and coupled to appropriate signal transduction pathways in response to specific stimuli. One level of specificity is provided by physical linkages between the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEFs, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; WT, wild-type; TAgNLS, large T antigen nuclear localization sequence; PH, pleckstrin homology. and the Rho-type GTPases to upstream receptors that respond to specific stimuli. These linkages can be provided by direct binding interactions between a receptor and a GEF (e.g. Refs. 4.Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K.

Currently, it is not understood how these interactions are coupled to downstream signal transduction cascades that may localize in the cytoplasm rather than at discrete sites on the plasma membrane. Analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shed much light on how cell polarity is regulated. S. cerevisiae undergoes polarized growth when it forms a bud in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle and when it forms a projection (termed shmoo) in response to mating pheromone as a precursor to contact and fusion with a cell of the opposite mating type (2.Casamayor A.

Both polarization events are mediated by the Cdc42 GTPase (12.Adams A.E. Johnson D.I. Longnecker R.M. Sloat B.F. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111 (E.

Site-specific localization of Cdc24 and Cdc42 at the cell cortex underlies the initiation of cell polarity during budding and mating.

Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Cdc24 and Bem1 also play essential roles in mediating polarized growth during mating (28.Chenevert J. Corrado K. Bender A. Pringle J. Herskowitz I. Nature. 1992; 356: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29.Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. Nature. 1998; 391 (A.): 195-198RCrossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The localized activation of Cdc42 by Cdc24 during mating is mediated in part by Far1, which orients the axis of polarized growth in a pheromone gradient, but is not essential for polarized growth (30.Dorer R. Pryciak P.M. Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 845-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31.Valtz N. Peter M. Herskowitz I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Far1 associates with Cdc24-Bem1 complexes and Ste4, the β subunit of the activated G protein βγ dimer that is activated by a pheromone receptor, and is able to activate Cdc42 at the plasma membrane (8.Butty A.C. Pryciak P.M. Huang L.S. Herskowitz I. Peter M. Science. 1998; 282: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9.Nern A Arkowitz R.A. J.

Cdc24 shuttles continuously through the nucleus and is anchored in late M and G1 phase nuclei by Far1, which is exported to the cytoplasm together with Cdc24 upon activation of the mating MAPK cascade (33.Toenjes K.A. Sawyer M.M. Johnson D.I. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1183-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34.Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. J.

Cdc24 activation of Cdc42 also regulates multiple MAPK cascades through Ste20, a p21-activated kinase that activates Ste11, a MAPK kinase kinase that functions in MAPK cascades that regulate mating, invasive growth/sterile vegetative growth, and high osmolarity growth (36.Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 37.Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Simpson D.A. Qi M. Wang Y. Elion E.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The activation of the mating MAPK cascade is coordinated by the Ste5 scaffold, which binds the Ste4 subunit of the activated G protein βγ dimer together with Ste11, the MAPK kinase Ste7, and the MAPK Fus3 (41.Bardwell L. Peptides (N. Y.). 2005; 26: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 42.Elion E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3967-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of Ste5 to Ste4 is thought to facilitate phosphorylation of Ste11 by Cdc42-GTP-bound Ste20, which also interacts with Ste4. Although Ste5 is in the cytoplasm, it must shuttle through the nucleus to localize asymmetrically at the cell cortex and to activate Fus3 (43.Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 44.Wang Y. Elion E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2543-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ste4 and the Ste2 receptor are broadly distributed at the plasma membrane prior to pheromone stimulation (45.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 46.Kim J. Bortz E. Zhong H. Leeuw T. Leberer E. Vershon A.K. Hirsch J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8826-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas basal cortical recruitment of Ste5 occurs at selective sites in G1 phase cells (44.Wang Y. Elion E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2543-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional factors may regulate its stable recruitment. In addition, Ste5 rapidly accumulates at asymmetric cortical sites within an isotropic environment of mating pheromone (43.Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is an early marker of polarization that is sensitive to internal cues. Although Cdc24 was proposed to be an effector of Ste4 during mating (37.Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), later work led to the conclusion that Cdc24 interacts with Ste4 indirectly through Far1 (8.Butty A.C. Pryciak P.M. Huang L.S. Herskowitz I. Peter M. Science. 1998; 282: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9.Nern A Arkowitz R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1187-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Cdc24 is a key regulator of Ste5 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and recruitment and plays a direct role in the interaction between Ste5 and Ste4 that is independent of Far1. Yeast Strains and Media—See Tables I and II for lists of the strains and plasmids used in this study. Yeast strains were grown in standard selective (synthetic complete) medium. Cells with GAL1-driven genes were pre-grown in medium containing 2% raffinose before induction in medium containing 2% galactose. Yeast transformations were done as described (44.Wang Y. Elion E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2543-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cdc24-4 and cdc42-1 temperature-sensitive strains were pre-grown at room temperature before being transferred to pre-warmed medium and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The MATamsn5Δ cdc24-4 (YMY942) double mutant was constructed by crossing MATα msn5Δ::HIS3 (YMY931) and MATacdc24-4 (EY1481) and screening progeny for temperature sensitivity, His+ phenotype, and ability to mate at permissive temperature. Parallel analysis with the cdc42-1 strain revealed that an msn5Δ cdc42-1 double mutant is nearly lethal at permissive temperature, suggesting that our ability to recover msn5Δ cdc24-4 double mutants is linked to the ability of the Cdc24(G168D) protein to sufficiently activate Cdc42 at room temperature.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainsGenotype/descriptionSource/Ref.EY699MAT a ura3-1 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 his3-11,15 ade2-1 can1-100R.

Quantitation of Ste5-GST and Ste5-Myc9 nuclear and cortical localization was done as previously described (44.Wang Y. Elion E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2543-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), counting at least 500 cells for each sample, with the exception of the msn5Δ experiment, in which 100–150 cells were tallied per sample. Cells were examined under a Zeiss Axioscope 2 microscope linked to a Hamamatsu C4742-95 digital camera. Live Cell Imaging of GFP-Cdc24 and Ste5-GFP—Strains harboring 415MET(GFPS65T-A8-CDC24) (EBL664) (33.Toenjes K.A. Sawyer M.M. Johnson D.I. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1183-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) on a centromeric plasmid were pre-grown overnight in selective synthetic complete medium, and the cultures were diluted into selective synthetic complete medium containing 0.19 mm methionine and cultured overnight so that they were in early logarithmic phase for visualization the next day (A600 ∼ 0.1). Strains harboring CUP1-STE5-GFP (pSKM21) (43.Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were grown overnight at room temperature in selective synthetic complete medium to early logarithmic phase (A600 ∼ 0.15) and then shifted to selective synthetic complete medium containing 0.5 mm CuSO4 for 2 h. Latrunculin A Effect on Ste5-Myc9, Ste5-GFP, and GFP-Cdc24—For Ste5-GFP and GFP-Cdc24, cells were treated with 200 μm latrunculin A for 30 min to 2.5 h before observation under the microscope. A total of 300 cells were counted for each sample. The expression of Ste5-GFP was induced from the CUP1 promoter after the cells had been incubated for 30 min with latrunculin A. For Ste5-Myc9, expression was either constitutively induced from the STE5 promoter or induced from the GAL1 promoter concomitantly with the addition of latrunculin A. Whole Cell Extracts, Co-immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared by glass-bead breakage using modified H buffer with 200 mm NaCl as described (44.Wang Y. Elion E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2543-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitations and immunoblot analysis were carried out as described (44.Wang Y. Elion E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2543-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the whole cell extracts was determined with the Bio-Rad assay. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed with 250 μg to 2 mg of whole cell protein extracts, 3–5 μg of antibody 12CA5, 1–2 μg of antibody 9E10, and 30 μl of protein Aagarose beads (Sigma). Antibodies were from the following sources: anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-Far1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Technology Inc.), anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 and anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Harvard Monoclonal Antibody Facility), anti-phospho-p42/p44 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-Fus3 antibody (Elion laboratory), anti-Tcm1 monoclonal antibody (gift of J. Warner, Albert Einstein College of Medicine), and anti-MBP polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Expression of MBP-Cdc24 in Escherichia coli—BL21 cells harboring MBP-CDC24 (pYMW146) were induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h before harvesting. MBP-Cdc24 and MBP were detected by Coomassie Blue staining of polyacrylamide gels and confirmed by immunoblot analysis with anti-MBP antibody. Ste5-Myc9 and MBP-Cdc24 Binding Experiments—Ste5-Myc9 and ste5Δ whole cell extracts were incubated with antibody 9E10, and the immunoprecipitates were collected and washed stringently five times with modified H buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl. The immunoprecipitates were then incubated in total lysates from BL21 cells harboring MBP-Cdc24 or MBP for 90 min on ice and washed five times with modified H buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl before being subjecting to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The membrane was probed with anti-MBP antibody first and then stripped and reprobed with antibody 9E10. Active Fus3 was detected exactly as described (40.Andersson J. Simpson D.A. Qi M. Wang Y. Elion E.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity in immunoblots was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Ste5 Is Recruited to the Cortex of G1 Phase Cells in the Absence of Ste4—To test whether additional proteins besides Ste4 regulate recruitment of Ste5, we determined whether Ste5 is still basally recruited in a ste4Δ null strain. This was done with Ste5-GST, which is recruited more efficiently than wild-type (WT) Ste5 as a result of greater oligomerization and can be readily detected at the cell cortex in the absence of pheromone stimulation (44.Wang Y. Elion E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2543-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Strikingly, Ste5-GST was still basally recruited in the ste4Δ strain to the same level as in the control STE4 strain, although α factor could not induce an increase in recruitment (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, basal recruitment of Ste5 is not dependent on binding to the mating G protein and is regulated by other factors. In contrast, basal activation of the mating MAPK cascade is dependent on Ste4 and was blocked in the ste4Δ strain, even when Ste5-GST was overexpressed from a multicopy 2μ plasmid, as shown by negligible expression of a FUS1-lacZ reporter gene (Fig. 1C). Temperature-sensitive Mutations in Cdc24 and Cdc42 Block Basal and α Factor-induced Recruitment of Ste5—We determined whether Bem1, Cdc24, and Cdc42 regulate basal recruitment of Ste5 by quantitating the level of Ste5-GST recruitment in a bem1Δ null strain and in temperature-sensitive cdc24-4 and cdc42-1 strains. Cortical localization of Ste5-GST still occurred in the bem1Δ mutant, but it was weaker and more diffusely spread out than in the control cells (Fig. 2, A and C). In contrast, temperature shift inactivation of either the Cdc42-1 or Cdc24-4 protein to 37 °C completely blocked Ste5-GST recruitment (Fig. 2, B and D). Cdc24 and Cdc42 were also required for mating pheromone-induced recruitment of Ste5-GST (Fig. 2D, +αF) and Ste5-Myc9 (Fig. 3, A and B) after a 15-min induction with α factor after the temperature shift. In contrast, Bem1 was not essential for α factor-induced recruitment, but was required for efficient recruitment (Figs. 2C and 3, A and B) and increased the level of recruitment of Ste5-Myc9 when overexpressed from a multicopy 2μ plasmid (Fig. 3B). Thus, Bem1 stimulates α factor-induced recruitment of Ste5, whereas Cdc24 and Cdc42 are essential for Ste5 recruitment to occur.Fig. 3Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and plasma membrane localization of Ste5 requires Bem1, Cdc24, and Cdc42.A, Ste5-Myc9 in WT, cdc24-4, cdc42-1, and bem1Δ cells. WT and bem1Δ cells were grown at 30 °C. The cdc24-4 and cdc42-1 strains and their respective WT controls were then shifted from room temperature (RT) to 37°C for 3 h. B, quantitation of Ste5-Myc9 localization in cell polarity mutants. Cells were grown at the indicated temperatures and then treated with (+αF) or without (-αF) α factor for 15 min.

Cells were grown as described for B. F, Cdc24 is required for nuclear accumulation of Ste5-Myc9 in an msn5Δ mutant. Shown is the indirect immunofluorescence of Ste5-Myc9 in cells shifted from room temperature to 37 °C for 3 h. The percentage of total cells with clearly greater intensity of staining of Ste5-Myc9 in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm at 37 °C was 90% for msn5Δ, <1% for cdc24-4, and 20% for msn5Δ cdc24-4 (n = 100–150).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Basal Ste5 Recruitment and Fus3 Activation Are Blocked in the Presence of Cdc24(G168D)—The requirement for Cdc24 and Cdc42 in Ste5 recruitment was apparent at permissive temperature (room temperature) in addition to non-permissive temperature (37 °C). In particular, basal recruitment of Ste5-GST was completely blocked in both cdc24-4 and cdc42-1 strains, although some pheromone-induced recruitment of Ste5-GST and Ste5-Myc9 occurred (Figs. 2D and 3B). The level of Cdc42-1 protein is reduced compared with WT Cdc42 at permissive temperature (47.Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Yeast. 1997; 13: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), consistent with the decrease in Ste5 recruitment. In contrast, the Cdc24-4 protein, which harbors a G168D mutation in the calponin homology domain, is expressed at normal levels and retains the ability to activate Cdc42 at permissive temperature (48.Shimada Y. Wiget P. Gulli M.P. Bi E. Peter M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This result suggests that Cdc24 regulates Ste5 recruitment through a function distinct from regulation of Cdc42. To substantiate the findings with Ste5-GST, we analyzed the localization of a functional Ste5-GFP fusion protein in live cells expressed at WT levels of expression (43.Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In WT cells, Ste5-GFP was detected at cortical sites in some G2/M and G1 phase cells (Fig. 2E, left panel, arrows), consistent with the findings with Ste5-GST. Shifting the temperature to 37 °C for 3 h greatly reduced the strength of the GFP signal, preventing accurate assessment of an effect of the cdc24-4 and cdc42-1 mutations. However, the cdc24-4 and cdc42-1 mutations blocked basal recruitment of Ste5-GFP at room temperature (Fig. 2E), consistent with the findings for Ste5-GST. Basal recruitment of Ste5 is required for basal activation of the mating MAPK cascade. To determine whether the defect in basal Ste5 recruitment correlates with a defect in MAPK activation, the level of basal activation of Fus3 was assessed. Whole cell extracts from WT, cdc24-4, and cdc42-1 strains grown at room temperature and shifted to 37 °C for 3 h were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-p42/p44 antibody, which recognizes the active form of Fus3 (40.Andersson J. Simpson D.A. Qi M. Wang Y. Elion E.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Basal activation of Fus3 was greatly reduced at non-permissive temperature in both cdc24-4 and cdc42-1 strains (Fig. 2F), consistent with the observed block in Ste5 recruitment and the expected block in Ste20 recruitment. A block in Fus3 activation was also observed at room temperature in the cdc24-4 strain compared with a partial block in the cdc42-1 strain (Fig. 2F). Consistent with this, overexpression of Ste5-GST did not induce morphological changes resembling shmoo formation in the cdc24-4 strain at room temperature, although it did induce them in t"
https://openalex.org/W2086812605,"We previously proposed that HIV-1 minus strand transfer occurs by an acceptor invasion-initiated multi-step mechanism. During synthesis of minus strong stop DNA, reverse transcriptase (RT) transiently pauses at the base of TAR before continuing synthesis. Pausing promotes RT-RNase H cleavage of the donor RNA, exposing regions of the cDNA. The acceptor RNA then invades at these locations to interact with the minus strong stop DNA. Whereas primer extension continues on the donor RNA, the cDNA-acceptor hybrid expands by branch migration until transfer of the primer terminus is completed. We present results here showing that the interaction of the acceptor RNA and the cDNA can be determined by examining the time-dependent cleavage of the acceptor RNA by RNase H. Our approach utilizes a combination of RT-RNase H and Escherichia coli RNase H to allow assessment of acceptor-cDNA interactions at high sensitivity. Results show an initial interaction of the acceptor RNA with cDNA at the base of TAR. We observe a time-dependent shift in RNase H susceptibility along the length of the acceptor toward the 5′ end, suggesting hybrid propagation from the initial invasion point. Control experiments validate that the RNase H cleavage profile represents the formation and expansion of the acceptor-DNA interaction and that the process is promoted by the nucleocapsid. Observations with this new approach lend additional support to the proposed multistep transfer mechanism. We previously proposed that HIV-1 minus strand transfer occurs by an acceptor invasion-initiated multi-step mechanism. During synthesis of minus strong stop DNA, reverse transcriptase (RT) transiently pauses at the base of TAR before continuing synthesis. Pausing promotes RT-RNase H cleavage of the donor RNA, exposing regions of the cDNA. The acceptor RNA then invades at these locations to interact with the minus strong stop DNA. Whereas primer extension continues on the donor RNA, the cDNA-acceptor hybrid expands by branch migration until transfer of the primer terminus is completed. We present results here showing that the interaction of the acceptor RNA and the cDNA can be determined by examining the time-dependent cleavage of the acceptor RNA by RNase H.

During retrovirus reverse transcription, minus strand DNA synthesis initiates near the 5′ end of the RNA genome. In HIV-1, 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, primer binding site; nt, nucleotide; –sssDNA, minus strand strong stop DNA; NC, nucleocapsid; R, repeat. synthesis to the genome 5′ end results in a DNA fragment about 200 nt long called minus strand strong stop DNA (–sssDNA). Direct repeat (R) sequences at either ends of the genomic RNA facilitate transfer of the strong stop DNA from the 5′ end to the 3′ end of either the same or the copackaged RNA (Ref. 1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 49-83Google Scholar and references therein). The 5′ and 3′ repeat regions thereby serve as the donor and acceptor templates, respectively, in this transfer process. The transfer process is obligatory to the completion of reverse transcription and synthesis of double-stranded viral DNA. The HIV-1 genomic RNA contains 97-nucleotide-long repeat regions, the 5′-terminal 56 nts of which form the TAR hairpin. Deletion and mutational analysis demonstrate that strong stop transfer in HIV-1 does not require all of the R-region homology (2Lobel L.I. Goff S.P. J.

Studies in murine leukemia virus have suggested that homology-independent factors, such as template structure and sequence, are also involved in facilitating minus strand transfer (8Topping R. Demoitie M.A. Shin N.H. Telesnitsky A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The RT-RNase H activity is essential at various steps of reverse transcription, including minus strand transfer (Ref. 9Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-117Google Scholar and references therein). During minus strand synthesis, RT-RNase H cleaves the donor RNA within the RNA-DNA hybrid regions. This enables the –sssDNA to transfer to the acceptor. Viruses defective in RT-RNase H activity are unable to complete reverse transcription and show accumulation of –sssDNA in the cytoplasm (10Repaske R. Hartley J.W. Kavlick M.F. O'Neill R.R.

The viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein is also an important component in viral reverse transcription and strand transfer. NC displays nucleic acid chaperone activities, folding the polymer strands into their most thermodynamically stable conformations (19Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J.

Such properties of NC very likely promote the displacement of the fragmented donor and annealing between the acceptor and cDNA, thereby promoting the transfer process. Additionally, NC has been shown to enhance RT-RNase H activity promoting rapid degradation of the donor RNA (25Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J.

Results showed that cleavages within internal regions of the donor RNA are important for transfer. However, cleavages at the 5′ terminus of the donor template are not a prerequisite for transfer. Additionally, transfer products accumulated prior to formation of cleavages at the donor 5′ terminus, further supporting the idea that transfer occurs via an acceptor invasion-initiated mechanism, not involving cleavages near the donor 5′ end. Our invasion model predicts that during minus strand transfer, the homologous region of the acceptor RNA invades the donor-cDNA hybrid at gaps created by RT-RNase H cleavage of the donor RNA. Although RT continues synthesis on the donor RNA, the acceptor-cDNA interaction initiates the transfer event well behind the polymerizing RT. The acceptor-cDNA hybrid then propagates by branch migration, strand-displacing the donor RNA fragments. Eventually, the primer terminus switches from the donor to the acceptor RNA, completing transfer of the cDNA. RT then resumes synthesis using the acceptor RNA as the new template. In a recent study of HIV-1 minus strand transfer, we identified potential acceptor invasion sites within the donor RNA-cDNA hybrid (29Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). RT pausing at the base of the TAR hairpin promotes extensive cleavage of the donor RNA about 20 nt behind the pause site (29Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We designed a series of short DNA oligonucleotides that could compete with specific regions of the acceptor RNA for interaction with the cDNA and block transfer. Blocking oligomers complementary to the region around the base of the TAR hairpin were the most effective at inhibiting transfer. These combined observations suggest the region around the base of TAR to be an invasion site. In the current study, we developed a technique to further analyze the acceptor invasion mechanism. Using a combination of RT and E. coli RNase H we analyzed the acceptor RNA cleavage profile during the course of the transfer reaction. Sensitivity to RNase H cleavage was used as an indication of RNA-DNA hybrid formation. Results showed that acceptor RNA was first cleaved 60–90 nt from the U3-3′R junction, agreeing with initiation of invasion at the base of TAR. A shift of the cleavage pattern toward the acceptor 5′ end was then observed, suggesting hybrid propagation and primer terminus switch. We also show that productive invasion depends on the viral NC protein, clarifying why NC promotes transfers. Results correlate with the previous observations from the donor cleavage and blocking oligomer assays. All indicate that RNase H cleavages at the base of TAR allow acceptor invasion that initiates the transfer process. Materials—Recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (p66/p51 heterodimer) was purified as described previously (28Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Hanson M.N. Wohrl B.M. Le Grice S.F. Roques B.P.

HIV-1 NCp7 (72 amino acids) was prepared by solid phase chemical synthesis as described previously (36de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), and 2′O-methyl-modified RNA oligomers were from Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The oligo(dA) and oligo(dT) were purchased from the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (New Haven, CT). The 32P isotope was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The T7 MEGA shortscript and Escherichia coli RNase H were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All other enzymes, dNTP mixture, and ddNTP mixture were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Preparation of Templates—The D199, D130, and A97h RNA templates were prepared by run-off transcription in vitro, as described previously (29Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 2′O-M-(4-20) D199 donor RNA was generated by ligating a 31-nt 5′ fragment containing the 2′O-methyl modification, to a 168-nt 3′ fragment using DNA ligase and bridging DNA oligomer as described previously (37Wisniewski M.

The 31-nt 5′ fragment was synthesized by Dharmacon, whereas the 3′ RNA fragment was generated by run-off transcription. All RNA templates used in the study were purified by denaturing PAGE and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA buffer. RNAs were quantified using the Ribogreen assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cDNA130 was purchased from IDT Inc. (Coralville, IA). Transfer Assay—Reactions were performed as described previously (29Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

The PBS DNA primer or RNA templates were 5′ end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (6000 (222 TBq) Ci/mmol) and polynucleotide kinase to follow either the primer extension or the acceptor degradation, respectively. Primer was annealed to donor RNA by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min and slow cooling to room temperature. Unless described otherwise, substrates were incubated with an appropriate amount of NC and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. One NC molecule per 7 nts of RNA or DNA was taken as 100% coating (38Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder II, R.C. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. Bryant D.K. Fenselau C. J.

RT was pre-bound to substrate at 37 °C for 2 min before reactions were initiated with MgCl2 and dNTPs. Final reactions contained 2.5 nm primer/template, 7.5 nm acceptor RNA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 16 nm HIV-1 RT, 6 mm MgCl2 and 17 μm dNTPs, respectively. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and were terminated at appropriate time points with 2× termination dye (10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 90% formamide (v/v), and 0.1% each of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue). Products were resolved by denaturing PAGE, and visualized and analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant software (version 2.1). Sizes of DNA products were determined by using 10-bp DNA ladders, whereas sizes of RNA products were estimated using RNA ladders generated by RNase T1 digest. Detecting Acceptor Cleavage Using E. coli RNase H—Transfer assays were set up as described above, using 5′ end-labeled acceptor RNA. At appropriate time points, reverse transcription was terminated with a mixture of oligo(dA):oligo(dT) and ddNTP at a final concentration of 1 nm oligo(dA):oligo(dT) and 50 μm ddNTP. Following termination, the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 min with 8 units of E. coli RNase H. Reactions were then terminated by adding 1 volume of 2× termination dye. Products were resolved on 9% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Acceptor RNA Cleavage and Transfer Mechanism—Our previous analyses suggested that minus strand strong stop transfer in HIV-1 is accomplished in a multistep process (29Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). During the course of minus strand synthesis, RT paused at the base of the TAR hairpin. While paused, RT cleaved the donor template, creating gaps within the donor-cDNA hybrid. The acceptor template invaded the donor-cDNA complex at such sites, forming a hybrid. Hybrid formation and subsequent events leading to the terminus transfer, as proposed by our acceptor invasion model, are diagrammed in Fig. 1A. The acceptor-cDNA hybrid was susceptible to RNase H cleavage. We hypothesized that the time-dependent profile of RNase H cleavage of the acceptor template would reveal the stepwise progression of the transfer reaction. This is best envisioned when the acceptor is labeled at its 5′ end. The site of initial interaction and the course of the hybrid propagation should be seen. Acceptor RNA Cleavage during Minus Strand Transfer—The HIV-1 minus strand transfer assay system used in this study (Fig. 1B) has been described previously (29Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The D199 donor RNA is a 199-nt segment from the 5′ end of the genomic RNA, containing the R, U5, and PBS regions. The A97h acceptor RNA comprises the 97-nt R region and 20 nt of the U3 sequence. Synthesis was primed from an 18-nt DNA primer complementary to the PBS. Assays were performed at 200% NC coating level (1 NC molecule per 3.5 nt). Acceptor degradation was followed during the course of the transfer reaction using a 5′ end-labeled acceptor RNA. The experimental approach is outlined in Fig. 2A. Reactions contained excess RT over primer/template, thereby increasing the opportunity for RNase H cleavage. Fig. 2B shows the acceptor cleavage profile during the course of the RT-catalyzed transfer reaction. By about 4 min, bands appeared indicating cleavage at a distance of 80–105 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the acceptor. This is the expected region of invasion at the base of TAR, as suggested previously by blocking oligonucleotide and homology length experiments (29Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A series of intermediate size cleavage products, 60–20 nts in size, observed through the 4–45-min period suggested a progressive acceptor-cDNA hybrid formation from the base of TAR (initial invasion site) to the 5′ end of the acceptor. By 16–45 min, a dense set of cleavage products 5–19 nt in size appeared. The size of these cleavage products and their time of appearance indicate cleavage of the acceptor 5′ terminus, following completion of synthesis to the end of this template. The cleavage products observed indicate that the RNase H activity intrinsic to the RT cleaves the acceptor RNA during the course of the transfer reaction. Regions of cleavage are therefore indicative of acceptor hybridization with the cDNA. The profile shows an early appearance of cuts at the base of TAR and a time-dependent progression of cuts toward the 5′ end of the acceptor RNA. The observed acceptor cleavage profile is consistent with the proposed multistep transfer mechanism in which acceptor-cDNA interaction initiated at the base of TAR and propagated toward the 3′ end of the cDNA. Analysis of cDNA synthesis under the same conditions (Fig. 2C) showed that by 2 min some primer extensions were paused at the base of TAR, whereas a similar amount had completed full-length extension on the donor template. By 8 min a similar amount of primers were paused at the base of TAR and considerably more were fully extended. Concomitant with RT pausing, extensive cleavages were observed on the donor at the base of TAR, during the 2–8-min reaction time (see Ref. 29Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that for those substrates undergoing transfer, invasion can occur just after the primer has extended past the pause site. The propagating hybrid can then follow behind the RT, which is continuing synthesis on the donor RNA. Analyzing Acceptor Cleavage during Transfer by Subsequent Treatment with E. coli RNase H—The previous experiment used the intrinsic RNase H activity of RT to make the cleavages that mark interaction sites of the acceptor RNA and the donor-cDNA. This approach relies on the capacity of the RT-RNase H to make endonucleolytic cleavages in the acceptor RNA as it interacts and forms partial hybrids with the cDNA. Studies by DeStefano and co-workers (40Raja A. DeStefano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10102-10111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have shown that certain RNA-DNA hybrid structures that mimic the acceptor-invasion intermediates are not efficiently cleaved by HIV-1 RT-RNase H. This would explain the observed inefficient acceptor cleavage at the early time points, although transfer products are already formed. Effective probing of acceptor-cDNA interactions would require use of a nonspecific and robust RNase H activity. We therefore developed a second method to analyze acceptor cleavage during transfer, as out-lined in Fig. 3A. RT-catalyzed transfer reactions were set up as described previously. The reaction was sampled at various time points, and RT activity was terminated by a process that traps the RT molecule. The reaction intermediates were then incubated with E. coli RNase H for 3 min, and the time-dependent acceptor cleavage profile was visualized. Fig. 3B shows the time-dependent pattern of acceptor cleavage using E. coli RNase H. E. coli RNase H was titrated to determine the minimal amount required to amplify acceptor cleavage (data not shown). Compared with cleavages by RT (Fig. 2B), much more of the acceptor molecules sustained cleavages in the E. coli RNase H analysis, producing denser bands of cleavage products and the expected greater sensitivity. Remarkably the band pattern, although darker, showed important similarities to the cleavage profile observed in experiments with RT alone (Fig. 2B). It showed dense bands at the proposed invasion site and a progression of cleavages moving toward the 5′ end of the acceptor RNA. In the similarities of the two patterns, the two techniques lend validity to each other in showing the site of initial interaction between the acceptor and cDNA. The pattern of the E. coli RNase H analysis also had additional features not present in the analysis with RT alone. These include dense acceptor cleavages 25–30 nucleotides from the 5′ end and the early appearance of the 5–9-nt terminal cleavage products. These will be addressed below. One feature of the acceptor cleavage profile was that it closely matched the cDNA synthesis profile. This suggested the possibility that the progressive cleavages observed from the 3′ to 5′ end of the acceptor is dictated by the length of cDNA synthesized at any given time point. If so, the initial acceptor cleavages at the base of TAR would not be from the creation of a site-specific invasion site. To address this issue, we performed the assay by adding the acceptor RNA 5 min after RT reaction with the primer/donor template (Fig. 3C). This ensured that full-length cDNA synthesis was completed in a substantial proportion of the templates before acceptor interactions were initiated. If cleavages at the acceptor 3′ end were indeed associated with partial cDNA synthesis, then the delayed addition of the acceptor should cause a decrease in intensity of the acceptor 3′ cleavages. On the other hand, if acceptor invasion is facilitated by the creation of a specific invasion site on the donor RNA at the base of TAR, then addition of the acceptor after completion of cDNA synthesis should still generate the same profile of acceptor cleavage as observed in Fig. 3B. As observed in Fig. 3C, acceptor cleavage pattern remained basically unchanged from that in Fig. 3B. The predicted invasion site at the acceptor 3′ end was still very evident. The time requirement for cDNA synthesis and creation of invasion site within the donor-cDNA hybrid is very likely the reason for the slight delay in formation of the 3′ cleavage products in Fig. 3B as compared with Fig. 3C. Overall, these results suggest that cleavages at the 3′ end of the acceptor result from a site-specific invasion that is independent of length of cDNA synthesized. Control Experiments Show That Trapping Conditions Stop Synthesis and Cleavage by RT—The purpose of the E. coli RNase H procedure was to detect acceptor-cDNA interactions that are progressively formed during the course of a transfer event. To assess this accurately, it is important that termination of RT activity and subsequent E. coli RNase H probing be done under the following condition: 1) minimally disrupt the structures of the RT-generated transfer intermediates, and 2) efficiently terminate RT activity while still allowing for subsequent treatment with E. coli RNase H. We therefore used a mixture of dideoxynucleoside triphosphates to terminate synthesis and oligo(dT):oligo(dA) to trap the RT as it dissociates from the substrate. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in Fig. 4. The RT reactions were sampled at various time points and terminated with the ddNTP + oligo(dT):oligo(dA) mixture. One-half of the terminated reaction was immediately mixed with an EDTA:formamide stop solution, a method known to be absolutely effective at terminating catalysis. To verify if any enzymatic activity continued after the addition of the termination mixture, the other half was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before addition of the EDTA:formamide stop solution. The effectiveness of the ddNTP termination mixture was tested for both synthesis (Fig. 4A) and RNase H activities (Fig. 4B). As observed, the 10-min incubation after addition of the ddNTP termination mixture did not yield any additional synthesis or RNase H cleavage products, confirming that the ddNTP + oligo(dT):oligo(dA) mixture served as an effective terminator for both the polymerase and RNase H activities of HIV-1 RT. Therefore, this verifies that during E. coli RNase H incubation, the substrate is no longer susceptible to the activities of the RT. Retention of the Donor RNA Cleavage Profile during E. coli RNase H Treatment—The E. coli RNase H probing was designed to track the initiation and progression of interactions between the acceptor and cDNA by following acceptor degradation. Correct analysis of this interaction therefore required that E. coli RNase H not alter the cleavage profile of the donor, thereby altering acceptor invasion site. To address this issue, we analyzed donor RNA degradation under identical experimental conditions as described for the acceptor cleavage assays (Fig. 3). In these reactions donor RNA D130 was labeled at its 5′ end. Degradation of the donor RNA was followed in the absence (Fig. 5A) and presence of E. coli RNase H treatment (Fig. 5B). During synthesis, the donor RNA sustained a series of adjacent cuts as RT paused at the base of the TAR hairpin. We previously related these cuts to the preferred site of invasion of the acceptor RNA for minus strand transfer. Although the E. coli RNase H degrades the don"
https://openalex.org/W2123506146,"Besides acting as an inhibitor, the propeptide of human cathepsin B exerts an important auxiliary function as a chaperone in promoting correct protein folding. To explore the ability of N-terminally truncated forms of procathepsin B to fold into enzymatically active proteins, we produced procathepsin B variants progressively lacking N-terminal structural elements in baculovirus-infected insect cells. N-terminal truncation of the propeptide by up to 22 amino acids did not impair the production of activable procathepsin B. Secreted forms lacking the first 20, 21, or 22 amino acids spontaneously generated mature cathepsin B through autocatalytic processing, demonstrating that the first α-helix (Asp11-Arg20) is necessary for efficient inhibition of the enzyme by its propeptide. In contrast, proenzymes lacking the N-terminal part including the first β-sheet (Trp24-Ala26) of the propeptide or containing an amino acid mutation directly preceding this β-sheet were no longer properly folded. This shows that interactions between Trp24 of the propeptide and Tyr183, Tyr188, and Phe180 of the mature enzyme are important for stabilization and essential for procathepsin B folding. Thus, proenzyme forms missing more than the N-terminal 22 amino acids of the propeptide (notably truncated cathepsin B produced by the mRNA splice variant lacking exons 2 and 3, resulting in a propeptide shortened by 34 amino acids) are devoid of proteolytic activity because they cannot fold correctly. Thus, any pathophysiological involvement of truncated cathepsin B must be ascribed to properties other than proteolysis.

Thus, any pathophysiological involvement of truncated cathepsin B must be ascribed to properties other than proteolysis. The cysteine peptidase family C1 (the papain family, merops.sanger.ac.uk) contains two groups of enzymes within subfamily C1A characterized by the length of their propeptides: cathepsin B-like and cathepsin L-like enzymes. They show very little sequence homology in their proregions, and in contrast to cathepsin L-like proenzymes, which have a propeptide of about 100 amino acids in length, the propeptide region of the cathepsin B-like proenzymes is about 60 amino acids long (1Cygler M. Mort J.S. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Studies on cathepsins B, L, and S demonstrated that the propeptides or parts of them are effective inhibitors of their cognate enzymes (2Chen Y. Plouffe C. Menard R. Storer A.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 24-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 3Fox T. de Miguel E. Mort J.S. Storer A.C.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of human procathepsin B shows that the propeptide (Arg 1p-Lys 62p, where p stands for propeptide) is jacketed around the catalytic domain of the enzyme in a C-shaped fold, positioned in the direction opposite to bound substrates, thereby shielding the active site (6Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Turk V. Turk D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 774-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Two regions of rat procathepsin B were found to be particularly important for inhibition, the NTTWQ sequence spanning residues 21p-25p, and the CGTVL sequence (amino acids 42p-46p) (2Chen Y. Plouffe C. Menard R. Storer A.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 24-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Besides their function as intramolecular inhibitors, propeptides of several peptidases have been shown to assist in folding. Early in vitro refolding experiments showed that deletions in the propeptide of human cathepsin L resulted in the loss of enzymatic activity due to the lack of refolding capacity of the mature enzyme (7Smith S.M. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20487-20495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the deletion of most of the prosegment of Fasciola hepatica cathepsin L1 resulted in a drastic decrease of secreted active enzyme (8Cappetta M. Roth I. Diaz A. Tort J. Roche L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and deletion/mutagenesis studies of mouse cathepsin L and human cathepsin S also confirmed the folding competence of the propeptide of cathepsin L-like peptidases (9Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q.L. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Schilling K. Pietschmann S. Fehn M. Wenz I. Wiederanders B. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 859-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the propeptide of cathepsin X, which consists of only 38 amino acids, was assumed to be unable to induce protein folding but is thought to stabilize the conformation of the N-terminal domain of the enzyme by forming a disulfide bridge between the proregion and the active site cysteine (11Sivaraman J. Nägler D.K. Zhang R.L. Menard R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The chaperone function of the cathepsin B propeptide was not thoroughly investigated so far. Truncated procathepsin B, referred to as “truncated cathepsin B” according to the literature, which is encoded by an alternatively spliced mRNA and lacks the signal peptide and 34 amino acids of the propeptide, was originally described as a catalytically active enzyme in vitro (12Mehtani S. Gong Q.M. Panella J. Subbiah S. Peffley D.M. Frank-fater A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13236-13244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the function of the human cathepsin B propeptide as a chaperone, putting particular emphasis on the folding competence of truncated cathepsin B. To identify the structural elements necessary for the chaperone activity, we produced N-terminally shortened forms of human procathepsin B progressively lacking structural propeptide elements or carrying mutations that abolish N-glycosylation in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. We discuss the importance of the interaction between Trp 24p and the mature enzyme for proper protein folding assistance and provide evidence for the crucial function of the first N-terminal α-helix for intramolecular inhibition. We also show that truncated cathepsin B is not able to correctly fold into an enzymatically active conformation. Plasmids—The human cathepsin B mRNA, to which all sequences in this study refer, is the sequence of 1996 nucleotides deposited under accession number L16510 at EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ. The structure of the clones used in this study, the corresponding protein products, and their putative subcellular localization are shown in Table I and in Fig. 1. PCR, cDNA cloning, and site-directed mutagenesis were performed as described previously, using the vector 5′(-2)CBL16GFP as a template (13Müntener K. Zwicky R. Csucs G. Baici A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sequences of the primers used in this study are listed in Table II. For the construction of the vectors responsible for the delivery of the proteins to the secretory pathway, forward primers ProCB-2AaforPstI, ProCB-5AaforPstI, ProCB-9AaforPstI, ProCB-20AaforPstI, ProCB-21AaPstIf, ProCB-22AaPstIf, ProCB-23AaPstIf, ProCB-26AaPstIf, ProCB-20N21QPstIf, ProCB-20T23APstIf, or tCBforPstI and the reverse primers CBcdrevNotI or GFPrevNotI were used. The products were digested using PstI and NotI and inserted into vector pVT Bac His-1 (14Sarkar M. Pagny S. Ünligil U. Joziasse D. Mucha J. Glössl J. Schachter H. Glycoconj.

The fragments were then digested with BamHI and NotI and cloned into the BamHI and NotI restriction sites of the previously digested vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen).

Open table in a new tab Heterologous Expression of Cathepsin B Transcripts in Insect Cells—To express the various forms of procathepsin B in Spodoptera frugiperda cells, recombinant baculoviruses were constructed essentially as described (15Mucha J. Svoboda B. Frohwein U. Strasser R. Mischinger M. Schwihla H. Altmann F. Hane W. Schachter H. Glössl J. Mach L. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of BaculoGold viral DNA (Pharmingen) was cotransfected with 1 μg of the corresponding baculovirus transfer vector into Sf9 cells using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated at 27 °C for 5-6 days in IPL41 medium (Sigma) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Then the supernatant containing the recombinant virus was used to infect Sf21 cells grown in the same medium. Cells were harvested from the suspension by centrifugation at 400 × g at room temperature for 10 min, and supernatants were recovered and stored at 4 °C. Residual cells were scraped off with phosphate-buffered saline, added to the cell pellet, and centrifuged again. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged as in the preceding step, and stored at -20 °C. Cathepsin B Activity Assay—The activity of the heterologous enzyme was measured in both cell lysates and culture media. Cell lysates were prepared by resuspension in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol followed by sonication. Culture supernatants were sterile-filtered (0.22 μm) prior to use to remove residual cellular debris. As negative controls, uninfected Sf21cells or cells infected with a baculovirus containing the information for the production of an unrelated protein (rabbit N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase 1) were used (14Sarkar M. Pagny S. Ünligil U. Joziasse D. Mucha J. Glössl J. Schachter H. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type procathepsin B was purified from the respective culture supernatant essentially as described previously for N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase I (15Mucha J. Svoboda B. Frohwein U. Strasser R. Mischinger M. Schwihla H. Altmann F. Hane W. Schachter H. Glössl J. Mach L. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), with the purified proenzyme being stored in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% sodium azide. For pepsin activation of latent cathepsin B, 1.8 μl of 1 m HCl was added to 50 μl of the supernatants to lower the pH to ∼3.0. Cell lysates were treated by incubating 5 μl of lysate with 100 μl of pepsin solution (0.125 μg/μl in 0.1 m glycine/HCl buffer, pH 3.2) for 12 min at 37 °C. The substrate solution consisting of 0.1 mm N-benzyl-oxycarbonyl-l-Arg-l-Arg-7-(4-methyl)-coumarylamide (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.0, was added to either pepsin-treated or untreated cell suspension or supernatant. To verify the specificity of the reaction, the cathepsin B-specific inactivator N-(l-3-trans-propylcarbamoyloxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-isoleucyl-l-proline (CA-074, Bachem) was added at a final concentration of 10 μm. Incubation took place under shaking in the dark at room temperature. The fluorescence of the liberated 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured at various incubation times in a Bio Assay Reader HTS 7000 Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) reader at 430 nm after excitation at 360 nm. Standard solutions of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, the concentration of which was determined photometrically using an absorption coefficient of 16,000 m-1 cm-1 at 342 nm, were used to calibrate the assay. Enzymatic Deglycosylation with PNGase F and Endo-H—Prior to either enzymatic treatment, the samples (final volume: 10 μl) were heat-inactivated for 5 min at 95 °C in the presence of 0.5% SDS, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μg/ml cysteine peptidase inactivator E-64 (Bachem). For the peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digest, 10 μl of 0.3 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 15 mm EDTA, 5 μl of a 7.5% Triton X-100 solution, and 2.5 units PNGase F (Roche Applied Science) were added to the sample and incubated overnight at 37 °C. For the endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) digest, 10 μl of 0.15 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, 5 μl of 7.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 2 μl of doubly distilled H2O, and 5 units of Endo-H (Roche Applied Science) were added to the sample solution, and incubation took place at 37 °C overnight. The control samples were treated the same way, but instead of the enzyme, 2 μl of doubly distilled H2O was added. The next day, another 2 units of PNGase F or 5 units of Endo-H were added to the samples and incubated for another 3 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by precipitation with 240 μl of cold methanol and incubated for 30 min at room temperature before centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with 1.0 ml of acetone (-20 °C), centrifuged as above, air-dried, dissolved in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and heat-denatured at 95 °C before separating the proteins by SDS-PAGE. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates and supernatants were mixed with reducing sample buffer, and SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 12% acrylamide gel. The primary antibody for all Western blots was sheep anti-cathepsin B (16Graf M. Baici A. Sträuli P. Lab. Investig. 1981; 45: 587-596PubMed Google Scholar), and the secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). Bands were visualized by the light-emitting, non-radioactive method (BM chemiluminescence POD, Roche Applied Science). Baculovirus-mediated Expression of Truncated Procathepsin B Forms—The baculovirus expression vector system was used to obtain secretion of newly synthesized recombinant proteins into the culture medium. The secretion of these foreign proteins by insect cells is achieved by replacing the foreign signal peptide sequences with the signal peptide sequence derived from the secretory insect protein melittin (14Sarkar M. Pagny S. Ünligil U. Joziasse D. Mucha J. Glössl J. Schachter H. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Mucha J. Svoboda B. Frohwein U. Strasser R. Mischinger M. Schwihla H. Altmann F. Hane W. Schachter H. Glössl J. Mach L. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As in mammalian cells, only properly folded proteins are able to pass through the secretory pathway of insect cells and undergo terminal N-glycan processing (17Altmann F. Staudacher E. Wilson I.B.H. März L. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast, misfolded or unassembled proteins targeted to the secretory pathway are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (18Strasser R. Stadlmann J. Svoboda B. Altmann F. Glössl J. Mach L. Biochem. J. 2004; (10.1042/BJ20041686)PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, only properly folded proteins are able to enter the secretory pathway of insect cells and become further glycosylated, whereas misfolded or unassembled proteins get stuck in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, cell extracts and supernatants of baculovirus-infected cells expressing different N-terminally truncated versions of human cathepsin B were analyzed by Western blot to assess their secretion status and thus the folding competence of the respective recombinant protein. Additionally, to analyze cytosolic expression and the influence of GFP attached to tCB on proper folding, proCB, tCB, tCBGFP, and mCB were expressed in the cytosol of insect cells by omitting the signal peptide. A short digest with pepsin was used to activate the latent proenzymes. In this assay, only correctly folded procathepsin B is converted into an enzymatically active form, whereas destabilized variants are completely digested with pepsin (19Mort J.S. Recklies A.D. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, ProCB-2, -5, -9, -20AA, and wild type ProCB targeted to the secretory pathway are indeed secreted into the medium, as revealed in each lane by a band around 40 kDa (lanes 1-4 and 8), which was ascribed to procathepsin B. In lanes 4 and 8, another band at about 33 kDa was detectable, representing the mature single chain form of cathepsin B, which arose from autocatalytic activation. In lanes 5 and 6, containing ProCB-23 and -26AA, no bands could be detected even if four times more culture medium was loaded onto the gel (not shown). Fig. 3 shows the culture media of Sf 21 cells expressing the secretory proteins ProCB-20AA, ProCB-20N21Q, ProCB-20T23A, ProCB-21AA, or ProCB-22AA and a variant of tCB containing a signal peptide. In each lane of Fig. 3A, except for those for ProCB-20T23A, tCB, and the uninfected cells, a band around 40 kDa was visible and represented procathepsin B. The secreted proteins were produced to different extents and showed partial activation as seen by the band around 33 kDa corresponding to mature single chain cathepsin B. To exclude that this mature form of cathepsin B arose through autocatalytic processing during the warm-up phase of heat inactivation, the experiments were repeated by adding the cysteine peptidase inactivator E-64 at a final concentration of 0.14 mm to the samples before heating and analyzing them again by Western blotting (not shown). The culture medium of the Sf 21 cells expressing ProCB-20, -20N21Q, -21, and -22AA showed exactly the same pattern of bands as before. Consequently, these proenzymes are indeed prone to spontaneous autoactivation by virtue of their shortened proregion. In the blots in Figs. 2B and 3B, showing the pepsin-treated samples, only bands around 33 kDa are visible, demonstrating that the propeptides were completely removed by pepsin. This also demonstrates that the secreted proteins were correctly folded because pepsin activates only properly folded procathepsin B, whereas it degrades destabilized or misfolded forms. In Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6, showing secretory forms of ProCB-23 and -26AA, respectively, no bands could be detected on the blot since these procathepsin B forms were quantitatively retained within the insect cells (see also Fig. 7). However, ProCB-2, -5, -9, and -20 AA were properly digested into the single chain form of cathepsin B. Fig. 3B shows that the secretory proteins ProCB-20, -20N21Q, -21, and -22 AA (lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5) can be activated by pepsin. This points out that they are properly folded and therefore secreted by the cells, contrary to the similarly produced variants ProCB-20T23A (lane 3) and tCB (lane 7), which were not secreted at all. The faint bands at around 45 kDa visible in blot B in every lane represent pepsin. Surprisingly, the proregion lacking 22 amino acids was still able to act as a chaperone, whereas the proregion in which the amino acid at position 23 was mutated lost its chaperone function. As shown in Fig. 3, lane 7, tCB targeted to the secretory pathway was not secreted into the supernatant of the cells, not even if it was fused to GFP (data not shown). Pepsin treatment of the cell lysate containing secretory tCBGFP resulted in the complete digestion and disappearance of the band around 60 kDa (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1a and 1b). In addition, the cells did not display any GFP fluorescence. This finding indicates that secretory tCBGFP was misfolded. Cytosolic Expression—ProCB, mCB, tCB, and tCBGFP were also expressed in the cytosol of insect cells by omitting the signal peptide. All cytosolically produced proteins were present in large amounts in the cells (Fig. 4, lanes 2a-5a). Cells expressing tCBGFP in the cytosol fluoresced (material applied to lane 5a), showing that GFP was correctly folded in the chimera. However, following pepsin digestion, no bands were left (Fig. 4, lane 5b), showing that besides GFP, which denatures under the acidic conditions of pepsin activation, the remaining truncated cathepsin B protein was also not correctly folded. In addition, ProCB, mCB, and tCB were all unable to correctly fold in the cytosol as shown in Fig. 4, lanes 2-4. Cathepsin B Activity Measurement—Samples of the pepsin-treated and untreated proenzymes used in Figs. 2 and 3 were assayed to measure the cathepsin B activity of the secretory and of the cytosolically expressed enzyme forms. This handy method allowed the qualitative assessment of the chaperone and inhibitory function of the proregion. To confirm the cathepsin B specificity of the reaction, measurements were also carried out in the presence of the cathepsin B-specific inactivator CA-074. The secreted enzyme forms ProCB-2, -5, -9, and -20 AA were clearly active, contrary to ProCB-23AA and ProCB-26AA, which did not seem to be correctly folded and secreted when targeted to the secretory pathway, as shown by a cathepsin B activity indistinguishable from background values (Fig. 5). As already seen in Figs. 2 and 3, ProCB-20AA, ProCB-20N21Q, ProCB-21AA, and ProCB-22AA were partially autoactivated and therefore showed activities even without pepsin activation. In Fig. 5, the autoactivation of ProCB-20N21Q, ProCB-21AA, and ProCB-22AA is hard to perceive as compared with ProCB-20AA because the former three proteins were secreted at a much lower level. WT-ProCBGFP targeted to the secretory pathway was indeed secreted by the cells and was active after pepsin treatment (Fig. 6). In contrast, secretory tCBGFP was quantitatively retained within the cells in an inactive state as shown in Fig. 4, lanes 1a and 1b. Similarly, all cathepsin B forms produced in the cytosol of the insect cells were devoid of enzymatic activity (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Cathepsin B activity measurements. Enzyme activity (as nanokatal (nkat)) was normalized to 1 ml of sample. The density of S. frugiperda cells was 3 × 105 cells/ml.

Preprocathepsin B translocates cotranslationally into the rough ER, where the signal peptide is removed and N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides are attached to the glycosylation sites. Only the properly folded proenzyme can be transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where its N-glycans are further processed to complex N-linked oligosaccharides. If a protein is retained in the ER, it contains only high mannose N-glycans and thus remains Endo-H-sensitive, whereas secreted glycoproteins usually are resistant to cleavage by this enzyme. Although Endo-H only cleaves high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides, N-glycosidase F is also active on hybrid and complex-type N-glycans. Secreted ProCB-9AA was activable by pepsin. Therefore, it should be Endo-H-insensitive but PNGase-sensitive. Indeed, a band around 40 kDa is present in Fig. 7, lanes 1a and 1c, showing the untreated protein and the Endo-H-treated protein displaying the same electrophoretic mobility. The band in lane 1b has a lower apparent molecular mass and represents deglycosylated ProCB-9AA obtained by treatment with PNGase F. The same pattern was found in lanes 7a-7c, containing a lysate of cells expressing secretory ProCB-9AA. These results show that secreted ProCB-9AA, as well as the proenzyme remaining in the cell, were not Endo-H-sensitive, thus confirming their correct folding. Secreted ProCB-20AA, ProCB-21AA, and ProCB-22AA were similarly insensitive to Endo-H treatment, but the intracellular proenzymes were mostly Endo-H-sensitive (Fig. 7, lanes 3a-3c and lanes 8a-8c). Consequently, the proenzymes lacking 20, 21, and 22 amino acids apparently have more difficulties to fold properly. The glycosylation site mutant ProCB-20N21Q showed the same behavior, whereas the ProCB-20T23A mutant was unable to fold correctly and therefore could not be detected in the supernatant. This can be explained with structural changes in the propeptide region due to alanine instead of threonine at position 23. Supernatants of cells expressing secretory forms of ProCB-23AA and -26AA were concentrated 25 times before being applied to the gel, but there were still no bands visible. ProCB-23AA and -26AA targeted to the secretory pathway were visible as strong bands in the cell lysates, clearly showing Endo-H sensitivity (Fig. 7, lanes 11 and 12). Secretory tCB, which is not secreted by the cells, suggesting that it is misfolded, revealed also Endo-H sensitivity (Fig. 7, lanes 13a-13c). The baculovirus protein expression system in insect cells, which share many similarities with mammalian cells, represents a very useful tool for investigating biosynthesis, posttranslational processing, and folding of mammalian proteins. In addition, the level of endogenous cathepsin B in these cells is extremely low. In the baculovirus system, only correctly folded proteins follow the secretory pathway and are released into the cell supernatant. On the contrary, unfolded or misfolded proteins cannot be secreted because they are retained in the ER. Since ER retention results in altered N-glycosylation, the folding competence of recombinant proteins, such as cathepsin B, can be monitored by checking their glycosylation state. We investigated the properties of the human cathepsin B proregion as a chaperone and as an intramolecular inhibitor using a systematic deletion approach of selected amino acid sequences starting at the N terminus of the molecule. According to the known secondary structure of the cathepsin B propeptide, variants missing 2, 5, 9, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, and 34 (tCB) amino acids and two mutant forms aimed at preventing N-glycosylation, namely asparagine 21 to glutamine and threonine 23 to alanine, were expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus system. These particular mutated constructs were aimed at showing whether the amino acid sequence or the glycosylation is responsible for correct folding. Analysis of cell culture supernatants showed that all variants except for those lacking more than 22 amino acids or containing a mutation at this position could be correctly folded and secreted. Thus, the region around amino acid 23 is critical for cathepsin B folding. Interestingly, secreted forms lacking 20, 21, or 22 amino acids spontaneously generated mature cathepsin B through autocatalytic processing. The mutant form ProCB-20N21Q, lacking the N-glycosylation site, was also correctly folded, which shows that proper protein folding is not dependent on glycosylation of the propeptide. Our results highlight the importance of specific elements of the propeptide of human cathepsin B that are responsible for its chaperone and intramolecular inhibitory function. In contrast to in vitro unfolding/refolding studies derived from the proregion of human procathepsin S and human procathepsin L (7Smith S.M. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20487-20495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pietschmann S. Fehn M. Kaulmann G. Wenz I. Wiederanders B. Schilling K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1453-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the insect cell system allows the assessment of protein folding under physiological conditions. Since folding was impaired in the case of the propeptide shortened by 23 amino acids and in the case of the propeptide mutated at position 23, we suggest that hydrophobic interactions between tryptophan 24p and tyrosine 183, as well as tyrosine 188 and phenylalanine 180, are necessary for folding and for anchoring the propeptide at the enzyme surface as suggested by Turk et al. (21Turk D. Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Dolinar M. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, tryptophan 24p was shown to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of glutamine 189 (21Turk D. Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Dolinar M. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We consider that the sequence N-terminal to the tryptophan anchor could be responsible for fastening the proregion at the surface of the cathepsin B molecule, whereas a single amino acid can no longer sustain this function as evident from the propeptide variant shortened by 23 amino acids. A mutation at position 23, e.g. Thr to Ala as in this study, possibly leads to major structural differences with respect to the wild type protein, which hinders the interaction of the proregion with the enzyme surface. A similar stabilization of the enzyme structure through hydrophobic interactions was also demonstrated for cathepsin S (22Wiederanders B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 477: 261-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of 20 amino acids resulted in a propeptide with reduced inhibitory competence and thus favored autocatalytic processing to the mature form of cathepsin B. This suggests a key role of the α-helix (D11p-R20p) for proper inhibitory activity of the propeptide. If this helix is missing, destabilization of the propeptide is likely to occur, accompanied by insufficient protection of the active site and ending up with autocatalytic processing. Truncated cathepsin B, the product of the mRNA splice variant missing exons 2 and 3 and lacking the first 34 N-terminal amino acids of the propeptide (23Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), was claimed to fold into an enzymatically active species in vitro (12Mehtani S. Gong Q.M. Panella J.

Our present results do not support this point of view since deletion of more than 22 amino acids of the propeptide invariably resulted in inactive cathepsin B forms, even when forced into the cytosolic expression pathway. Although being unable to be secreted and to assume an active conformation in the reducing milieu of the cytosol, we demonstrated that, by virtue of a cryptic mitochondrial leader sequence exposed by the truncation, the final destination of tCB is the mitochondrion (24Müntener K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 41012-41017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereby nuclear fragmentation and cell death are elicited (13Müntener K. Zwicky R. Csucs G. Baici A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Preliminary evidence for mitochondrial processing of the imported enzyme was provided by Western blots of cellular fractions separated by differential centrifugation (24Müntener K. Zwicky R. Csucs G. Rohrer J. Baici A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41012-41017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although mitochondria possess the necessary machinery to fold imported proteins (25Chacinska A. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 299-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we could not demonstrate any enzymatic activity of mitochondrial tCB thus far. In line with a hypothesis put forward by Sivaraman et al. (11Sivaraman J. Nägler D.K. Zhang R.L. Menard R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in analogy with cathepsin X, we can speculate that Cys 42p of the shortened proregion of truncated cathepsin B might form a transient disulfide bridge with the active site cysteine residue. However, proteolytic activity is not a stringent requirement for truncated cathepsin B to elicit pathophysiological effects in cells. In fact, certain proteolytic enzymes exert important physiological activities independent of their enzymatic activity. Thus, the leukocyte serine peptidases elastase, myeloblastin, and cathepsin G kill bacteria without involvement of their powerful catalytic centers (26Gabay J.E. Scott R.W. Campanelli D. Griffith J.

Immun. 1976; 14: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For myeloblastin, a hysteretic mechanism aimed at preventing proteolytic activity during phagocytic killing of bacteria has been proposed (28Baici A. Szedlacsek S.E. Früh H. Michel B.A. Biochem.

These observations will be considered in future studies aiming at elucidating the physiological function of truncated cathepsin B.

In early stages of atherosclerosis excess cholesterol is mainly deposited as cholesteryl fatty acyl esters (“cholesteryl ester”). As atherosclerosis progresses, both cholesteryl ester and cholesterol accumulate (4Johnson W.J. Warner G.J. Yancey P.G. Rothblat G.H. Subcell. Biochem. 1996; 27: 239-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Advanced lesions are characterized by the formation of extracellular lipid cores that consist of cholesteryl ester, crystals of cholesterol monohydrate, and debris (5de Duve C. Acta Cardiol.

Invest. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Intracellularly, cholesterol builds up as a component of membranes and as oily droplets of cholesteryl ester that form in the cytoplasm and inside lysosomes (4Johnson W.J. Warner G.J. Yancey P.G.

At the late stages of disease progression, lysosomes become the major site of lipid accumulation (4Johnson W.J. Warner G.J. Yancey P.G. Rothblat G.H. Subcell.

The mechanisms that are responsible for the formation of cholesteryl esters in atheromatous cells have only partly been resolved.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The aberrant accumulation of cholesteryl ester in lysosomes, however, remains to be explained (8Jerome W.G. Yancey P.G. Microsc. Microanal. 2003; 9: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cholesterol in atherosclerotic lesions is predominantly derived from serum lipoproteins such as low density lipoprotein (LDL) (11Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar). LDL consists of a hydrophobic core containing mainly cholesteryl ester and triglycerides surrounded by a lipid monolayer and apolipoprotein B100 (12Jonas A. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam2002: 483-504Google Scholar). LDL and its atherogenic derivatives are recognized by cell surface receptors, internalized, and transferred to the endosomal system. Cholesteryl ester and triglycerides are then hydrolyzed by acidic cholesteryl ester hydrolase (aCEH), generating cholesterol and fatty acids (11Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar, 13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 2563-2587Google Scholar). It has previously been proposed that lysosomal cholesteryl ester accumulation in atheromatous cells might result from a deficiency of aCEH (5de Duve C. Acta Cardiol. Suppl. 1974; 20: 9-25Google Scholar, 15Goldfischer S. Schiller B. Wolinsky H. Am. J. Pathol. 1975; 78: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar). Most subsequent studies on aCEH activity in atherosclerotic biopsies have found, however, that aCEH levels were unchanged or increased (14Assmann G. Seedorf U. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 2563-2587Google Scholar). Other hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the build-up of cholesteryl ester in lysosomes include esterification of cholesterol by a local enzyme (16Nilsson A. Norden H. Wilhelmsson L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 296: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), saturation of aCEH with excessive substrate (15Goldfischer S. Schiller B. Wolinsky H. Am. J. Pathol. 1975; 78: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar), impaired delivery of aCEH to substrate-carrying endosomes (17Jerome W.G. Cash C. Webber R. Horton R. Yancey P.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1362-1371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transport of ACAT-derived cholesteryl ester to lysosomes. Direct evidence in favor of any of these models, however, has not yet been available. To further address this issue we have studied the metabolism of cholesteryl ester and triglycerides in mouse macrophages in vivo and with intact endosomes in vitro. We show that net hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester depends on the ability of membranes to absorb cholesterol. When membrane cholesterol approaches saturation, as it does in atherosclerosis, cholesterol is re-esterified in endosomes. Endosomal esterification occurs independently of canonical ACATs. Endosomal hydrolysis of triglycerides was not affected by cholesterol, indicating that activity and transport of aCEH remained unchanged. These findings reveal a feedback connection between cellular cholesterol balance and endosomal cholesterol dispensation and provide a potential explanation for why cholesterol-saturated cells in atherosclerotic lesions accumulate cholesteryl ester in lysosomes.

Protocol 1—Three confluent 10-cm dishes of J774 cells were scraped into PBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g. Cells were resuspended in 2 ml of buffer C, incubated for 15 min on ice, homogenized using a bent 22-gauge needle attached to a 5-ml syringe, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g. The resulting post-nuclear supernatant was mixed with 4 ml of buffer B supplemented with 62% sucrose, overlaid with a 6-ml linear gradient of 15-35% sucrose in buffer B and centrifuged at 280,000 × g for 3.5 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 40Ti rotor. Protocol 2—Following in vitro reactions with membrane-covered PVT beads, samples were supplemented with 250 mg of sucrose plus 100 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11, and vortexed to dissolve the sucrose.

Cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer D. Cells were vortexed for 15 s and disrupted for 10 s with a model W-375 Ultrasonic sonicator. Homogenates (1 ml) then received an equal volume of 60% sucrose in buffer B. The samples were overlaid with a 10-ml linear gradient of 0-30% sucrose in buffer B and centrifuged at 280,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman SW 40Ti rotor. Plasma membrane acceptor beads were harvested from the gradient and quantified by an A600 measurement using bead suspensions of known concentrations for calibration. Protein and phospholipids were quantified as described below. 150 μl of 7% (w/v) wheat germ agglutinin PVT beads in water were mixed with 300 μl of hexane. Phosphatidylcholine (105 μg) and phosphatidylserine (113 μg) were added and the organic solvent dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. In some cases cholesterol was added at concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Beads were washed three times with cold PBS and resuspended in 250 μl of cold buffer E. Beads were quantified as described above. Protein and phospholipid were measured as described below. Unless otherwise stated, each reaction contained, in a final volume of 1 ml 250 mm sucrose, 125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, J774 endosomes (35-75 μg of protein), and 20 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.5 reactions) or 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5 control reactions). Reactions were carried out in siliconized 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and terminated by transfer of tubes to ice. Immediately thereafter, samples were extracted twice with chloroform: methanol (95:5) and subjected to thin layer chromatography. One confluent 10-cm dish of J774 cells was incubated for 6 h in medium A supplemented with 10% LPDS, liposomes (containing [3H]cholesterol; 10 μCi/ml medium), 5 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 10 μm CI-976. Cells were then harvested, homogenized with a bent 22-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The resulting post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 300 μl buffer F, pH 7.5, without oleoyl-CoA. ACAT activity was assayed in vitro as described (25Cheng D. Chang C.C. Qu X. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

To prepare whole-cell lipid extracts, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors. Lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (95:5) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. To quantify tritiated cholesteryl ester and triglycerides, lipids were separated on silica gel G plates (Analtech) using hexane:ethyl ether: acetic acid (70:30:1) as the mobile phase. Plates were calibrated with authentic standards, and lanes were split into 16 fractions and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. To quantify [3H]cholesterol and [3H]cholesteryl ester, lipids were separated on silica gel LK5D plates (Whatman, 150-Å pores) using hexane:ethyl acetate (90:10) as the mobile phase. Lanes were split into eight fractions, scraped, and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Total phospholipids were measured as described (26Zhou X. Arthur G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol was measured using an Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Molecular Probes). Protein was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid kit or with Coomassie Plus reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) and blotted with anti-Rab5 antibody (1:3,000). Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:40,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), developed with Supersignal West Pico substrate (Pierce), and exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature. Reconstitution of Endosomal Cholesteryl Ester Hydrolysis in Vitro—To understand why atherosclerotic foam cells accumulate cholesteryl ester in lysosomes we started by setting up a system to study endosomal cholesteryl ester metabolism in vitro. The assay, described in the legend to Fig. 1 and in Table I, is based on the use of separately prepared cell fractions enriched for endosomes and plasma membrane, respectively. Endosomes were prepared from mouse J774 macrophages grown in the presence of liposomes containing [3H]cholesteryl oleate plus non-radioactive trioleoylglycerol at 15 °C. Previous studies have shown that at this temperature, endocytosed lipoproteins accumulate in early endosomes and cholesteryl ester is hydrolyzed only to a small degree (27Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1976; 9: 663-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that cholesteryl oleate delivered to J774 cells in liposomes for 4 h at 15 °C is hydrolyzed only by ∼15% (data not shown). After sucrose gradient centrifugation, the bulk of the remaining esters can be collected from a sharp band that co-fractionates with the endosomal marker Rab5, well separated from the plasma membrane marker 5′-nucleotidase (Fig. 1A). By analyzing the sedimentability of the soluble endosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase we estimated that more than 90% of endosomal vesicles obtained by this method were intact and remained so during 2-h incubations at 37 °C (data not shown). Plasma membrane was purified by attachment to lectin-conjugated latex beads and equilibrium centrifugation and contained only small amounts of other organelles (Table I).Table ICharacterization of plasma membrane-covered PVT beadsEnzyme markerPost-nuclear supernatantsMembrane-covered beads5′-Nucleotidase0.72 ± 0.087.2 ± 1.3NADPH-cytochrome c reductase9.6 ± 1.31.1 ± 0.6α-Mannosidase II36.4 ± 3.62.5 ± 1.5β-Hexosaminidase834 ± 27143 ± 23 Open table in a new tab To determine whether cholesteryl ester hydrolysis can be reconstituted with this material in vitro,[3H]cholesteryl oleate-containing endosomes (“donors”) were mixed with plasma membrane-covered beads (“acceptors”) and incubated at pH 4.5. Subsequently, donor and acceptor membranes from each reaction were separated again by floating the plasma membrane-covered beads on sucrose gradients. Examination of the radioactive lipids showed a 64% reduction of [3H]cholesteryl oleate levels and a concomitant increase of [3H]cholesterol (Fig. 1B). Significantly, 29% of the [3H]cholesterol that was produced during 2-h incubations, but only trace amounts of [3H]cholesteryl oleate, were transferred to acceptor membranes (Fig. 1B, right panel). These results demonstrate that the in vitro system effectively reconstitutes hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester and that it allows for selective release of cholesterol. Hydrolysis was maximal at pH 4.5, and no activity was found with endosomes prepared from aCEH-deficient fibroblasts, indicating that hydrolysis under our assay conditions was catalyzed by aCEH (data not shown). Increased Endosomal Cholesteryl Ester Hydrolysis in the Presence of Plasma Membrane—In previous studies with cultured cells it has been estimated that about 70% of cholesterol produced by endosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester is transferred to the plasma membrane (28Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Using our cell-free system we asked, therefore, whether the presence of plasma membrane fractions affects the degree and the kinetics of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis. When labeled endosomes were incubated without acceptors for 2 h, [3H]cholesteryl oleate was reduced by 40% (Fig. 2A). Upon addition of increasing amounts of plasma membrane [3H]cholesteryl oleate levels further decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained with beads that had been covered with artificially prepared phospholipid membranes whereas naked beads were without effect (data not shown). Time curves for hydrolysis are shown in Fig. 2, B and C. In the presence of plasma membrane, hydrolysis proceeded three times faster during the first 30 min of the reaction as compared with controls (Fig. 2B). After 2 h, 40% of [3H]cholesteryl oleate was hydrolyzed in the absence of acceptors, while 82% was hydrolyzed in their presence (Fig. 2C). The observation that synthetic phospholipid membranes stimulate endosomal cholesteryl ester hydrolysis suggests that the effect seen with plasma membrane fractions also results from the presence of phospholipids rather than addition of a neutral hydrolase or other protein factors. Further support for this conclusion comes from experiments showing that (i) hydrolysis was significantly more efficient at pH 4.5 than at pH 7.5 and (ii) at pH 7.5 plasma membrane fractions exhibited no hydrolytic activity toward cholesteryl ester in liposomes, while hydrolysis at this pH was efficient when microsomes were used (data not shown). In summary, the results in Fig. 2 demonstrate that supplementary membranes promote net hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester. Since cholesterol is only poorly soluble in water (30Index Merck Budavari S. An encyclopedia of chemicals, drugs, and biologicals. 13th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Whitehouse Station, NJ2001Google Scholar) and a large fraction is selectively transferred to acceptors (Fig. 1C) the simplest explanation for this effect is that membranes promote hydrolysis by removing cholesterol from the endosomal “equilibrium” of cholesteryl ester metabolism (31Le Chatelier H.L. Annales des Mines. 1888; 13: 157-182Google Scholar). As one corollary of this model, the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids in endosomal donors would be expected to remain constant. To test this prediction, [3H]cholesteryl oleate-containing endosome fractions were incubated in the absence or presence of phospholipid-covered beads. Subsequently, the reaction mixtures were again separated to quantify [3H]cholesterol, [3H]cholesteryl ester, and phospholipids on donors and acceptors. Although the total amount of [3H]cholesterol produced was significantly higher in the presence than in the absence of acceptors (Fig. 2D), the [3H]cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio in the two populations of donor membranes remained in fact the same (Fig. 2E). The cholesterol difference was found quantitatively in the acceptor fraction, supporting the notion that the degree of net cholesteryl ester hydrolysis depends on the transfer of cholesterol to phospholipid membranes. Modulation of Net Cholesteryl Ester Hydrolysis by Membrane Cholesterol Concentration—Studies with purified lipids in vitro have shown that the capacity of phospholipid bilayers for cholesterol becomes saturated at about 50 mol %. Above that concentration, crystals of cholesterol monohydrate begin to form and cholesterol saturation is thought to be responsible for cholesterol precipitation in advanced atherosclerotic lesions (6Small D.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 103-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma membrane fractions used in our experiments contained ∼30% cholesterol with respect to phospholipids (Table II), which explains why these membranes are still efficient at absorbing cholesterol (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the cholesterol concentration in acceptor membranes affects the endosomal metabolism of cholesteryl ester, [3H]cholesteryl oleate-containing endosomes were incubated with membranes containing varying concentrations of cholesterol. Compared with endosomes incubated alone (Fig. 3A, Reaction 2), addition of cholesterol-free membranes more than doubled the amount of [3H]cholesteryl ester hydrolyzed (Reaction 3). When membranes with increasing amounts of cholesterol were added, net hydrolysis decreased in a concentration-dependent manner (Reactions 4-6). At the saturating concentration of 50 mol % cholesterol (6Small D.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 103-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), [3H]cholesteryl ester levels remained similar to those in samples without acceptors (compare Reactions 2 and 6). These results demonstrate that saturation with cholesterol renders membranes ineffective at stimulating endosomal cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in vitro.Table IIQuantification of cellular lipids following AcLDL treatmentAcLDLCI-976CholesterolCholesterol/(cholesterol + phospholipids)μg/mlμg/mg proteinmol %Total cell extracts:0−9.9 ± 0.329.3 ± 1.3+9.7 ± 0.628.8 ± 0.15−12.5 ± 0.432.2 ± 1.4+12.3 ± 0.330.9 ± 1.215−13.3 ± 0.334.4 ± 0.2+14.5 ± 0.835.4 ± 1.950−17.6 ± 0.339.0 ± 0.003+20.4 ± 1.742.5 ± 2.1Plasma membrane:0+104.4 ± 1.326.2 ± 0.750+210.7 ± 7.242.5 ± 2.7 Open table in a new tab To study the effect of increased membrane cholesterol on endosomal cholesteryl ester metabolism in vivo, J774 cells were grown for 4 h with increasing concentrations of acetylated LDL (AcLDL). As a consequence, the molar free cholesterol concentration with respect to phospholipids rose from 29% in controls to 39% in cells grown with 50 μg/ml of AcLDL and to 43% in cells grown with AcLDL plus the ACAT inhibitor CI-976 (Table II) (32Bocan T.M. Mueller S.B. Uhlendorf P.D. Newton R.S. Krause B.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1830-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with isolated plasma membrane fractions (Table II). In Fig. 3B J774 cells were loaded with cholesterol by incubation with AcLDL and CI-976 as described above. The cells were then washed and received [3H]cholesteryl oleate in liposomes for 3 h at 15 °C. Preincubation with AcLDL had no effect on the uptake of liposomes (data not shown). But when cells were subsequently washed and moved to 37 °C, significantly more [3H]cholesteryl oleate was found in cells that had been pre-loaded with AcLDL as compared with controls (Fig. 3B). The increased cholesteryl ester levels found in response to AcLDL are unlikely to result from the action of ACAT as all incubations were performed in the presence of ACAT inhibitor. The drug effectively blocks ACAT both in cells and membrane extracts (Figs. 5 and 6, see below).Fig. 6Cholesterol loading promotes cholesteryl ester synthesis in endo/lysosomes in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2093541583,"Two dimers of the replication terminator protein (RTP) of Bacillus subtilis bind to a chromosomal DNA terminator site to effect polar replication fork arrest. Cooperative binding of the dimers to overlapping half-sites within the terminator is essential for arrest. It was suggested previously that polarity of fork arrest is the result of the RTP dimer at the blocking (proximal) side within the complex binding very tightly and the permissive-side RTP dimer binding relatively weakly. In order to investigate this binding model, we have constructed a series of mutant terminators that contain half-sites of widely different RTP binding affinities in various combinations. Although there appeared to be a correlation between binding affinity at the proximal half-site and fork arrest efficiency in vivo for some terminators, several deviated significantly from this correlation. Some terminators exhibited greatly reduced binding cooperativity (and therefore have reduced affinity at each half-site) but were highly efficient in fork arrest, whereas one terminator had normal affinity over the proximal half-site, yet had low fork arrest efficiency. The results show clearly that there is no direct correlation between the RTP binding affinity (either within the full complex or at the proximal half-site within the full complex) and the efficiency of replication fork arrest in vivo. Thus, the differential binding affinity over the proximal and distal half-sites cannot be solely responsible for functional polarity of fork arrest. Furthermore, efficient fork arrest relies on features in addition to the tight binding of RTP to terminator DNA."
