https://openalex.org/W2088486634,"Eleazar Eskin and colleagues report a variance component model for correcting for sample structure in association studies. The EMMAX program is publicly available and may be used for analysis of genome-wide association study datasets. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous loci associated with complex traits, imprecise modeling of the genetic relatedness within study samples may cause substantial inflation of test statistics and possibly spurious associations. Variance component approaches, such as efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), can correct for a wide range of sample structures by explicitly accounting for pairwise relatedness between individuals, using high-density markers to model the phenotype distribution; but such approaches are computationally impractical. We report here a variance component approach implemented in publicly available software, EMMA eXpedited (EMMAX), that reduces the computational time for analyzing large GWAS data sets from years to hours. We apply this method to two human GWAS data sets, performing association analysis for ten quantitative traits from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort and seven common diseases from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We find that EMMAX outperforms both principal component analysis and genomic control in correcting for sample structure."
https://openalex.org/W2141916112,"Zhiwu Zhang and colleagues report a mixed linear model approach for correcting for population structure and family relatedness in genome-wide association studies. Mixed linear model (MLM) methods have proven useful in controlling for population structure and relatedness within genome-wide association studies. However, MLM-based methods can be computationally challenging for large datasets. We report a compression approach, called 'compressed MLM', that decreases the effective sample size of such datasets by clustering individuals into groups. We also present a complementary approach, 'population parameters previously determined' (P3D), that eliminates the need to re-compute variance components. We applied these two methods both independently and combined in selected genetic association datasets from human, dog and maize. The joint implementation of these two methods markedly reduced computing time and either maintained or improved statistical power. We used simulations to demonstrate the usefulness in controlling for substructure in genetic association datasets for a range of species and genetic architectures. We have made these methods available within an implementation of the software program TASSEL."
https://openalex.org/W2019524333,"Bone marrow endothelial cells (ECs) are essential for reconstitution of hematopoiesis, but their role in self-renewal of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) is unknown. We have developed angiogenic models to demonstrate that EC-derived angiocrine growth factors support in vitro self-renewal and in vivo repopulation of authentic LT-HSCs. In serum/cytokine-free cocultures, ECs, through direct cellular contact, stimulated incremental expansion of repopulating CD34−Flt3−cKit+Lineage−Sca1+ LT-HSCs, which retained their self-renewal ability, as determined by single-cell and serial transplantation assays. Angiocrine expression of Notch ligands by ECs promoted proliferation and prevented exhaustion of LT-HSCs derived from wild-type, but not Notch1/Notch2-deficient, mice. In transgenic notch-reporter (TNR.Gfp) mice, regenerating TNR.Gfp+ LT-HSCs were detected in cellular contact with sinusoidal ECs. Interference with angiocrine, but not perfusion, function of SECs impaired repopulation of TNR.Gfp+ LT-HSCs. ECs establish an instructive vascular niche for clinical-scale expansion of LT-HSCs and a cellular platform to identify stem cell-active trophogens."
https://openalex.org/W2089427152,"In the ovules of most sexual flowering plants female gametogenesis is initiated from a single surviving gametic cell, the functional megaspore, formed after meiosis of the somatically derived megaspore mother cell (MMC). Because some mutants and certain sexual species exhibit more than one MMC, and many others are able to form gametes without meiosis (by apomixis), it has been suggested that somatic cells in the ovule are competent to respond to a local signal likely to have an important function in determination. Here we show that the Arabidopsis protein ARGONAUTE 9 (AGO9) controls female gamete formation by restricting the specification of gametophyte precursors in a dosage-dependent, non-cell-autonomous manner. Mutations in AGO9 lead to the differentiation of multiple gametic cells that are able to initiate gametogenesis. The AGO9 protein is not expressed in the gamete lineage; instead, it is expressed in cytoplasmic foci of somatic companion cells. Mutations in SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 and RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 exhibit an identical defect to ago9 mutants, indicating that the movement of small RNA (sRNAs) silencing out of somatic companion cells is necessary for controlling the specification of gametic cells. AGO9 preferentially interacts with 24-nucleotide sRNAs derived from transposable elements (TEs), and its activity is necessary to silence TEs in female gametes and their accessory cells. Our results show that AGO9-dependent sRNA silencing is crucial to specify cell fate in the Arabidopsis ovule, and that epigenetic reprogramming in companion cells is necessary for sRNA-dependent silencing in plant gametes."
https://openalex.org/W1984850507,"The traditional view of hematopoiesis has been that all the cells of the peripheral blood are the progeny of a unitary homogeneous pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Recent evidence suggests that the hematopoietic system is actually maintained by a consortium of HSC subtypes with distinct functional characteristics. We show here that myeloid-biased HSCs (My-HSCs) and lymphoid-biased HSCs (Ly-HSCs) can be purified according to their capacity for Hoechst dye efflux in combination with canonical HSC markers. These phenotypes are stable under natural (aging) or artificial (serial transplantation) stress and are exacerbated in the presence of competing HSCs. My- and Ly-HSCs respond differently to TGF-beta1, presenting a possible mechanism for differential regulation of HSC subtype activation. This study demonstrates definitive isolation of lineage-biased HSC subtypes and contributes to the fundamental change in view that the hematopoietic system is maintained by a continuum of HSC subtypes, rather than a functionally uniform pool."

https://openalex.org/W2055243308,"Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) impair T cell function during chronic viral infections. Microbial products are now found to inhibit T cell function during HIV infection by upregulating PD-1 and IL-10 production by monocytes. Viral replication and microbial translocation from the gut to the blood during HIV infection lead to hyperimmune activation, which contributes to the decline in CD4+ T cell numbers during HIV infection. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) are both upregulated during HIV infection. Blocking interactions between PD-1 and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and between IL-10 and IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) results in viral clearance and improves T cell function in animal models of chronic viral infections. Here we show that high amounts of microbial products and inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of HIV-infected subjects lead to upregulation of PD-1 expression on monocytes that correlates with high plasma concentrations of IL-10. Triggering of PD-1 expressed on monocytes by PD-L1 expressed on various cell types induced IL-10 production and led to reversible CD4+ T cell dysfunction. We describe a new function for PD-1 whereby microbial products inhibit T cell expansion and function by upregulating PD-1 levels and IL-10 production by monocytes after binding of PD-1 by PD-L1."

We report association of EoE with variants at chromosome 5q22 encompassing TSLP and WDR36 (rs3806932, combined P = 3.19 x 10(-9)). TSLP is overexpressed in esophageal biopsies from individuals with EoE compared with unaffected individuals, whereas WDR36 expression is unaltered between the two groups.

https://openalex.org/W2112858422,"HIV infection has been difficult to cure because of uncharacterized reservoirs of infected cells that are resistant to antiretroviral therapy. This study shows that some hematopoietic stem cells are latently infected and may therefore constitute such a reservoir. HIV causes a chronic infection characterized by depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes and the development of opportunistic infections. Despite drugs that inhibit viral spread, HIV infection has been difficult to cure because of uncharacterized reservoirs of infected cells that are resistant to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the immune response. Here we used CD34+ cells from infected people as well as in vitro studies of wild-type HIV to show infection and killing of CD34+ multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). In some HPCs, we detected latent infection that stably persisted in cell culture until viral gene expression was activated by differentiation factors. A unique reporter HIV that directly detects latently infected cells in vitro confirmed the presence of distinct populations of active and latently infected HPCs. These findings have major implications for understanding HIV bone marrow pathology and the mechanisms by which HIV causes persistent infection."

Lee A.S. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized ER chaperones is the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), which is also referred to as BiP or HSPA5. GRP78 is involved in many cellular processes, including translocating newly synthesized polypeptides across the ER membrane, facilitating the folding and assembly of proteins, targeting misfolded proteins for ER-associated protein degradation, regulating calcium homeostasis, and serving as an ER stress sensor (2Hendershot L.M.

GRP78 is a master regulator for ER stress due to its role as a major ER chaperone with antiapoptotic properties as well as its ability to control the activation of the unfolded protein response signaling. In the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells undergo ER stress due to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. ER stress induction of GRP78 in cancer cells favors cell survival (4Fu Y. Lee A.S. Cancer Biol.

Pelham H.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that GRP78 can be detected in the nucleus and mitochondria (13Matsumoto A. Hanawalt P.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3921-3926PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sun F.C. Wei S. Li C.W.

Recently, an isoform of GRP78 generated by alternative splicing is localized to the cytosol (15Ni M. Zhou H. Wey S. Baumeister P. Lee A.S. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that a subfraction of the GRP78 cellular pool can localize to the surface in specific cell types, in particular cancer cells (16Liu C. Bhattacharjee G.

The preferential expression of GRP78 on the surface of tumor cells, but not in normal organs, enables specific tumor targeting by circulating ligands as well as other cytotoxic agents for cancer therapy without harmful effect on normal tissues (17Arap M.A. Lahdenranta J.

In another example, surface GRP78 mediates the antiangiogenic and proapoptotic activity of Kringle 5 through high affinity binding interaction of Kringle 5 with GRP78 exposed on the surface of stimulated endothelial cells and on hypoxic and cytotoxic stressed tumor cells (23Davidson D.J. Haskell C. Majest S. Kherzai A. Egan D.A. Walter K.A. Schneider A. Gubbins E.F. Solomon L. Chen Z. Lesniewski R. Henkin J.

Selim M.A. Papalas J. Pizzo S.V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Wang M. Wey S. Zhang Y. Ye R. Lee A.S. Antioxid.

It has been reported that GRP78 is an interactive partner of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, and knockdown of GRP78 by small interfering RNA attenuates activated α2-macroglobulin-induced signal transduction, impacting survival and metastasis of prostate cancer cells (25Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M.

Cripto, a multifunctional cell surface protein that is key to vertebrate embryogenesis and human tumor progression, was bound to cell surface GRP78, and blockade of this interaction prevented oncogenic Cripto signaling (28Shani G.

Vale W.W. Gray P.C. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2324-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Additionally, GRP78 associates with GPI-anchored T-cadherin on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, promoting their survival (30Philippova M. Ivanov D. Joshi M.B. Kyriakakis E. Rupp K. Afonyushkin T. Bochkov V. Erne P. Resink T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4004-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GRP78 interacts with the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and is implicated as a co-receptor for viral entry (31Triantafilou K. Fradelizi D. Wilson K. Triantafilou M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32Jindadamrongwech S. Thepparit C. Smith D.R. Arch. Virol. 2004; 149: 915-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Surface GRP78 is also required for the activation of an extrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated by extracellular Par-4 and TRAIL (33Burikhanov R. Zhao Y. Goswami A. Qiu S. Schwarze S.R. Rangnekar V.M. Cell. 2009; 138: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Recently, a new 82-kDa tumor-specific variant of GRP78 containing an O-linked carbohydrate moiety specific to malignant cells was discovered (34Rauschert N. Brändlein S. Holzinger E. Hensel F. Müller-Hermelink H.K. Vollmers H.P. Lab. Investig. 2008; 88: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This finding raises the possibility of targeting tumor cells via a specific cell surface variant of GRP78 (34Rauschert N. Brändlein S. Holzinger E. Hensel F. Müller-Hermelink H.K. Vollmers H.P. Lab. Investig. 2008; 88: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Further, phage display-derived human monoclonal antibodies isolated by binding to the surface of live primary breast cancer cells recognize a modified form of surface GRP78 at the C terminus (35Jakobsen C.G. Rasmussen N. Laenkholm A.V. Ditzel H.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9507-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, the extent and mechanism of relocalization of GRP78/BiP from the ER to the cell surface at the biochemical level is not well understood. Previously, through limited trypsin digestion and biochemical extractions of microsomes, we provided evidence that a subpopulation of GRP78 exists constitutively as a transmembrane protein, consistent with hydrophobicity predictions (6Reddy R.K. Mao C. Baumeister P. Austin R.C. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20915-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Because the ER membrane is a source for the plasma membrane, this could provide a plausible explanation for GRP78 cell surface localization. On the other hand, ER lumenal GRP78, by itself or through interacting with other proteins trafficking through the ER, could also cycle to the cell surface by escaping the ER retrieval mechanism. Here we report on the characterization of cell surface relocalization of GRP78 through a combination of cellular, biochemical, and mutational approaches and test various hypotheses that could help explain how GRP78 is expressed at the cell surface. The current studies provide quantitative analysis of GRP78 localization to the cell surface and reveal that this process involves multiple mechanisms. We demonstrate that ER stress can actively promote GRP78 surface expression, and overexpression of GRP78 can also lead to cell surface localization independent of ER stress. Further, based on analysis of domains of GRP78 that are exposed at the cell surface, we predict a topology for surface GRP78.DISCUSSIONIn view of the emerging importance of cell surface GRP78 in controlling cell signaling and viability, it is important to understand to what extent GRP78 is presented on the cell surface and the mechanism by which that is achieved. Studies on cell surface GRP78 expression performed in tissue culture show much variability, ranging from expression of GRP78 in various cancer cell lines to no expression in normal fibroblast cell lines (18Liu Y. Steiniger S.C. Kim Y. Kaufmann G.F. Felding-Habermann B. Janda K.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 4: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to positive reactivity with GRP78 binding peptide motifs whether or not they are tumor cells (17Arap M.A. Lahdenranta J. Mintz P.J. Hajitou A. Sarkis A.S. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 275-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). There are also conflicting reports of whether GRP78 is expressed on specific cell lines, such as the PC-3 prostate cancer cells (33Burikhanov R. Zhao Y. Goswami A. Qiu S. Schwarze S.R. Rangnekar V.M. Cell. 2009; 138: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 39Misra U.K. Deedwania R. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13694-13707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The discrepancies are probably due to different techniques used to detect cell surface GRP78, which is present at very low amounts and in only a subpopulation of cells, and the divergent results could also represent intrinsic variabilities among cultured cell lines. Here we used cell surface biotinylation as the primary method for identification and isolation of cell surface GRP78, coupled with FACS analysis of living cells. Whereas previous studies primarily examined endogenous GRP78, using both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against GRP78, we examined in addition tagged versions of wild type and mutated GRP78, using epitope antibodies that recognize GRP78 with specificity and high affinity. Due to their high transfection efficiency, we have selected the 293T cells as the model system, with additional analysis performed in HeLa and MCF-7 cells for independent confirmation. Our studies reveal several novel findings toward understanding how GRP78, an ER lumen protein, is localized to the cell surface.We report here that in cells maintained under normal culture conditions, the amount of surface GRP78 is extremely low but nonetheless detectable with a high sensitivity assay. Substantially higher levels of GRP78 localize to the cell surface following ER stress. This is consistent with the notion that as the amount of intracellular GRP78 and other ER chaperones also bearing KDEL increases, the KDEL retrieval system may be overwhelmed such that a fraction of GRP78 escapes to the cell surface. We report here that the surface GRP78 does not simply increase in parallel with intracellular GRP78; rather, it is about 4-fold higher than the increase in intracellular GRP78, suggesting that ER stress may activate specific mechanisms for GRP78 surface localization and/or inactivate mechanisms for its ER retention.Nonetheless, ER stress is not obligatory for cell surface localization of GRP78. GRP78 surface localization is readily detected in non-stressed cells with ectopic expression of GRP78. Examination of unfolded protein response markers in the transfected cells confirmed that ER stress is not triggered. Thus, this offers an experimental system to study mechanisms for GRP78 cell localization without the complication of other factors influenced by ER stress. Here, using specific mutations of GRP78, we tested several hypotheses that could in principle account for cell surface localization of GRP78. First, we examined whether deletion of the C-terminal KDEL motif, which is known to cause secretion of GRP78 outside the cell, affects surface localization. Our results revealed that at low dosages, the fraction of surface to intracellular protein was higher for F-GRP78Δ compared with the full-length protein, suggesting that escape from the KDEL retrieval mechanism could enhance surface expression. However, why this trend was reversed remains to be determined. One speculation is that cell surface presentation of F-GRP78Δ is linked to secretion because at the lower dosages the fraction of secreted to intracellular F-GRP78Δ was also higher.The discovery of patient antisera specifically recognizing O-linked GRP78 on the surface of malignant cells (34Rauschert N. Brändlein S. Holzinger E. Hensel F. Müller-Hermelink H.K. Vollmers H.P. Lab. Investig. 2008; 88: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the discovery that C terminus modification of GRP78 accounts for cancer-specific antibody specificity (35Jakobsen C.G. Rasmussen N. Laenkholm A.V. Ditzel H.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9507-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) prompted us to test the hypothesis that the putative O-linked glycosylation site of GRP78 is within close proximity of the KDEL motif and that modification of this site could mask the KDEL motif and allow GRP78 to escape the KDEL retrieval system. Our results showed no significant change in the level or the electrophoretic mobility of surface GRP78 regardless of whether the putative glycosylation site was intact or mutated in three different cell types. It is possible that none of the cell lines that we tested possesses this O-linked glycosylation modification mechanism. It is noted that the O-linked glycosylated form of GRP78 represents a very minor fraction of total GRP78 (34Rauschert N. Brändlein S. Holzinger E. Hensel F. Müller-Hermelink H.K. Vollmers H.P. Lab.

Thus, if cell surface GRP78 also contains a very low amount of the glycosylated form, this could be a minor pathway below the detection sensibility of our assays.Previously, we reported the existence of a subpopulation of GRP78 that exists as an ER transmembrane protein with its N-terminal region exposed to the cytosol (6Reddy R.K. Mao C. Baumeister P. Austin R.C. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20915-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). This was demonstrated by limited trypsin digestion of isolated microsomes, yielding a major resistant carboxyl band of about 35 kDa and a minor band of about 50 kDa. This was further confirmed with sodium carbonate extraction of the microsome membrane fractions, showing that GRP78 was present in both the membrane and the lumenal fractions (6Reddy R.K. Mao C. Baumeister P. Austin R.C. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20915-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Since ER membrane is a source of the plasma membrane, this form of GRP78 could be cycled to the cell surface. Consistent with this, we observed that calnexin, another ER transmembrane protein, is exposed to the cell surface, in agreement with an earlier report (37Okazaki Y. Ohno H. Takase K. Ochiai T. Saito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35751-35758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this model, the C-terminal region of GRP78 is expected to be exposed extracellularly. In support of this, studies using antibodies against the C terminus of GRP78 in FACS analysis detected surface GRP78 expression (18Liu Y. Steiniger S.C. Kim Y. Kaufmann G.F. Felding-Habermann B. Janda K.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 4: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Burikhanov R. Zhao Y. Goswami A. Qiu S. Schwarze S.R. Rangnekar V.M. Cell. 2009; 138: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here we observed that the His epitope tagged at the C terminus of GRP78 is also exposed. However, evidence is accumulating that the N terminus of GRP78 is also exposed on the cell surface. Thus, using antibody that targets the N-terminal region of GRP78, it was demonstrated that the interaction between surface GRP78 and extracellular Par-4 and GPI-anchored Cripto and T-cadherin could be negatively affected (29Kelber J.A.

Here using FACS analysis of ectopically expressed GRP78 bearing the FLAG epitope at the N terminus, we demonstrated directly that the N terminus of GRP78 is exposed. Furthermore, we discovered here that a middle domain of GRP78 is also exposed. We found no evidence that extracellular GRP78 binds stably to cell surface. Recent studies suggest that specific cell types may utilize different proteins for transporting GRP78 to the cell surface. For example, the ER transmembrane protein, MTJ-1, is implicated as the GRP78 carrier protein in macrophages (40Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, the tumor suppressor Par-4 is reported to be required for GRP78 cell surface localization in PC-3 cells, although the molecular basis for translocation of Par-4 inside the ER remains to be determined (33Burikhanov R.

Ther. 2009; 8: 2103-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our studies address fundamental mechanisms for GRP78 cell surface localization and open up new areas of investigations for partner protein complexes for its surface localization because it is evident that surface GRP78 plays critical roles in cell signaling, proliferation, and survival and has great potential for therapeutic interventions.

Lee A.S. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized ER chaperones is the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), which is also referred to as BiP or HSPA5. GRP78 is involved in many cellular processes, including translocating newly synthesized polypeptides across the ER membrane, facilitating the folding and assembly of proteins, targeting misfolded proteins for ER-associated protein degradation, regulating calcium homeostasis, and serving as an ER stress sensor (2Hendershot L.M. Mt. Sinai J. Med. 2004; 71: 289-297PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lee A.S. Methods. 2005; 35: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). GRP78 is a master regulator for ER stress due to its role as a major ER chaperone with antiapoptotic properties as well as its ability to control the activation of the unfolded protein response signaling. In the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells undergo ER stress due to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. ER stress induction of GRP78 in cancer cells favors cell survival (4Fu Y. Lee A.S. Cancer Biol.

Pelham H.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that GRP78 can be detected in the nucleus and mitochondria (13Matsumoto A. Hanawalt P.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3921-3926PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sun F.C. Wei S. Li C.W.

Recently, an isoform of GRP78 generated by alternative splicing is localized to the cytosol (15Ni M. Zhou H. Wey S. Baumeister P. Lee A.S. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that a subfraction of the GRP78 cellular pool can localize to the surface in specific cell types, in particular cancer cells (16Liu C. Bhattacharjee G.

https://openalex.org/W2097556771,"A new link is reported between regulators of endosomal trafficking and cytokinesis. Production of the phosphoinositide lipid PI3P at the midbody triggers the KIF13A-mediated recruitment of the centrosomal proteins FYVE-CENT and TTC19 to the division site. TTC19 may in turn regulate abscission by control of the ESCRTIII complex. Several subunits of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K-III) complex are known as tumour suppressors. Here we uncover a function for this complex and its catalytic product phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) in cytokinesis. We show that PtdIns(3)P localizes to the midbody during cytokinesis and recruits a centrosomal protein, FYVE-CENT (ZFYVE26), and its binding partner TTC19, which in turn interacts with CHMP4B, an endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III subunit implicated in the abscission step of cytokinesis. Translocation of FYVE-CENT and TTC19 from the centrosome to the midbody requires another FYVE-CENT-interacting protein, the microtubule motor KIF13A. Depletion of the VPS34 or Beclin 1 subunits of PI(3)K-III causes cytokinesis arrest and an increased number of binucleate and multinucleate cells, in a similar manner to the depletion of FYVE-CENT, KIF13A or TTC19. These results provide a mechanism for the translocation and docking of a cytokinesis regulatory machinery at the midbody."
https://openalex.org/W2145908472,"Mammalian ALDH7A1 is homologous to plant ALDH7B1, an enzyme that protects against various forms of stress, such as salinity, dehydration, and osmotic stress. It is known that mutations in the human ALDH7A1 gene cause pyridoxine-dependent and folic acid-responsive seizures. Herein, we show for the first time that human ALDH7A1 protects against hyperosmotic stress by generating osmolytes and metabolizing toxic aldehydes. Human ALDH7A1 expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells attenuated osmotic stress-induced apoptosis caused by increased extracellular concentrations of sucrose or sodium chloride. Purified recombinant ALDH7A1 efficiently metabolized a number of aldehyde substrates, including the osmolyte precursor, betaine aldehyde, lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes, and the intermediate lysine degradation product, alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde. The crystal structure for ALDH7A1 supports the enzyme's substrate specificities. Tissue distribution studies in mice showed the highest expression of ALDH7A1 protein in liver, kidney, and brain, followed by pancreas and testes. ALDH7A1 protein was found in the cytosol, nucleus, and mitochondria, making it unique among the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes. Analysis of human and mouse cDNA sequences revealed mitochondrial and cytosolic transcripts that are differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner in mice. In conclusion, ALDH7A1 is a novel aldehyde dehydrogenase expressed in multiple subcellular compartments that protects against hyperosmotic stress by generating osmolytes and metabolizing toxic aldehydes."
https://openalex.org/W1992646856,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential regulators of stem cells. PcG and trithorax group proteins mark developmental regulator gene promoters with bivalent domains consisting of overlapping repressive and activating histone modifications to keep them poised for activation in embryonic stem cells. Bmi1, a component of PcG complexes, maintains the self-renewal capacity of adult stem cells, but its role in multipotency remains obscure. Here we show that Bmi1 is critical for multipotency of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs). B cell lineage developmental regulator genes, Ebf1 and Pax5, appeared to be transcriptionally repressed by bivalent domains before lineage commitment. Loss of Bmi1 resulted in a resolution of bivalent domains at the Ebf1 and Pax5 loci, leading to their premature expression in HSC/MPPs accompanied by accelerated lymphoid specification and a marked reduction in HSC/MPPs. Thus, Bmi1 is required to reinforce bivalent domains at key developmental regulator gene loci to maintain lineage specification poised for activation in adult stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1999040147,"Of the known tumour suppressors, ARF and p53 are among the most relevant clinically, with p53 loss or inactivation found in more than half of human cancers and ARF known to activate p53 during oncogenic stress. A study of the mechanism of ARF-mediated p53 activation now shows that ARF is unstable in normal human cells but stable in cancer cells. In normal cells ARF ubiquitination and degradation is promoted by a ligase termed ULF (ubiquitin ligase for ARF), and this activity is abrogated in cancer cells. In response to oncogenic stress, the tumour suppressor ARF activates the p53 protein. ARF protein is highly stable in most human cell lines, so it has been thought that ARF activation occurs mainly at the level of transcription. Here, however, ARF is shown to be unstable in normal human cells but stable in cancer cells, through a transcription-independent mechanism. A ubiquitin ligase for ARF is identified and shown to promote ARF degradation in normal cells. This activity is prevented in cancer cells, stabilizing ARF. The tumour suppressor ARF is specifically required for p53 activation under oncogenic stress1,2,3,4,5,6. Recent studies showed that p53 activation mediated by ARF, but not that induced by DNA damage, acts as a major protection against tumorigenesis in vivo under certain biological settings7,8, suggesting that the ARF–p53 axis has more fundamental functions in tumour suppression than originally thought. Because ARF is a very stable protein in most human cell lines, it has been widely assumed that ARF induction is mediated mainly at the transcriptional level and that activation of the ARF–p53 pathway by oncogenes is a much slower and largely irreversible process by comparison with p53 activation after DNA damage. Here we report that ARF is very unstable in normal human cells but that its degradation is inhibited in cancerous cells. Through biochemical purification, we identified a specific ubiquitin ligase for ARF and named it ULF. ULF interacts with ARF both in vitro and in vivo and promotes the lysine-independent ubiquitylation and degradation of ARF. ULF knockdown stabilizes ARF in normal human cells, triggering ARF-dependent, p53-mediated growth arrest. Moreover, nucleophosmin (NPM) and c-Myc, both of which are commonly overexpressed in cancer cells, are capable of abrogating ULF-mediated ARF ubiquitylation through distinct mechanisms, and thereby promote ARF stabilization in cancer cells. These findings reveal the dynamic feature of the ARF–p53 pathway and suggest that transcription-independent mechanisms are critically involved in ARF regulation during responses to oncogenic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2064511920,"In this study, we investigated the regulation of FOXM1 expression by estrogen receptor α (ERα) and its role in hormonal therapy and endocrine resistance. FOXM1 protein and mRNA expression was regulated by ER-ligands, including estrogen, tamoxifen (OHT) and fulvestrant (ICI182780; ICI) in breast carcinoma cell lines. Depletion of ERα by RNA interference (RNAi) in MCF-7 cells downregulated FOXM1 expression. Reporter gene assays showed that ERα activates FOXM1 transcription through an estrogen-response element (ERE) located within the proximal promoter region. The direct binding of ERα to the FOXM1 promoter was confirmed in vitro by mobility shift and DNA pull-down assays and in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. Our data also revealed that upon OHT treatment ERα recruits histone deacetylases to the ERE site of the FOXM1 promoter, which is associated with a decrease in histone acetylation and transcription activity. Importantly, silencing of FOXM1 by RNAi abolished estrogen-induced MCF-7 cell proliferation and overcame acquired tamoxifen resistance. Conversely, ectopic expression of FOXM1 abrogated the cell cycle arrest mediated by the anti-estrogen OHT. OHT repressed FOXM1 expression in endocrine sensitive but not resistant breast carcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, qRT–PCR analysis of breast cancer patient samples revealed that there was a strong and significant positive correlation between ERα and FOXM1 mRNA expression. Collectively, these results show FOXM1 to be a key mediator of the mitogenic functions of ERα and estrogen in breast cancer cells, and also suggest that the deregulation of FOXM1 may contribute to anti-estrogen insensitivity."

Here we report the 3.0-Å resolution crystal structure of the ternary complex between human TGF-β1 and the extracellular domains of its type I and type II receptors, TβRI and TβRII. The TGF-β1 ternary complex structure is similar to previously reported TGF-β3 complex except with a 10° rotation in TβRI docking orientation. Quantitative binding studies showed distinct kinetics between the receptors and the isoforms of TGF-β. TβRI showed significant binding to TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 but not TGF-β1, and the binding to all three isoforms of TGF-β was enhanced considerably in the presence of TβRII. The preference of TGF-β2 to TβRI suggests a variation in its receptor recruitment in vivo. Although TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 bind and assemble their ternary complexes in a similar manner, their structural differences together with differences in the affinities and kinetics of their receptor binding may underlie their unique biological activities. Structural comparisons revealed that the receptor-ligand pairing in the TGF-β superfamily is dictated by unique insertions, deletions, and disulfide bonds rather than amino acid conservation at the interface. The binding mode of TβRII on TGF-β is unique to TGF-βs, whereas that of type II receptor for bone morphogenetic protein on bone morphogenetic protein appears common to all other cytokines in the superfamily.

TGF-βs are the founding members of a highly diversified family of signaling ligands and receptors, known as the TGF-β superfamily. To date the superfamily consists of more than 30 growth factors and cytokines, including TGF-βs, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), activins, inhibins, nodal, Müllerian inhibiting substance, growth differentiation factors, and others (4Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3984) Google Scholar). TGF-βs and related factors signal through two single-pass transmembrane receptors, known as the type I and type II receptors. These two receptor types have the same overall domain structure, including an extracellular ligand-binding domain displaying a three-finger toxin fold, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytosolic serine-threonine kinase domain. Signaling is initiated by the ligand, which binds the receptor extracellular domains, bringing them together and triggering a phosphorylation cascade, whereby the type II phosphorylates the type I, and the type I phosphorylates Smads, the cytoplasmic effectors of the pathway (3Derynck R.

The distinct mode of ternary complex assembly for BMP-2 and TGF-β underscores the complexity governing the ternary complex assembly. That also raises the question about which mode of type II receptor binding is realized for other cytokines in the superfamily and what are the critical factors determining receptor specificity and promiscuity. In addition, the cytokines outnumber their receptors in the family with at least 29 ligands in mammals signaling through seven type I and six receptors (3Derynck R. Zhang Y.E.

Genet. 1995; 11: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), yet some evidence suggests that it might also be due to differences in the ligands themselves. For example, the addition of purified exogenous TGF-βs has been shown to lead to different outcomes in a bilateral palatal shelf closing assay, with TGF-β3 promoting complete fusion and TGF-β1 and -β2 promoting only partial fusion (22Taya Y. O'Kane S. Ferguson M.W. Development. 1999; 126: 3869-3879PubMed Google Scholar). The application of purified TGF-β1 and -β3 has been further shown to lead to dramatic differences in cutaneous wound healing, with TGF-β3 preventing and TGF-β1 promoting scarring (23Shah M. Foreman D.M. Ferguson M.W. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 985-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which TGF-βs bind and assemble TβRI and TβRII into a signaling complex, to define the structural principles that underlie TGF-β isoform-specific function through comparison with the TGF-β3 ternary complex, and to define the structural principles governing the combinatorial ligand recognition among TGF-β superfamily receptors. Recombinant human TGF-β1 (residues 279–390 of the mature sequence) was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary lec3.2.8.1 cells as described previously (40Zou Z. Sun P.D. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For surface plasmon resonance experiments recombinant human TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 were expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded (41Cerletti A. Drewe J. Fricker G. Eberle A.N. Huwyler J. J. Drug Target. 2000; 8: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of human TβRI (residues 7–91) and TβRII (residues 15–130) were expressed in E. coli, refolded, and purified as previously reported (31Zúñiga J.E. Groppe J.C. Cui Y.

The ternary complex was separated from the excess of TβRI and TβRII by size exclusion chromatography in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Crystals of the TGF-β1·TβRI·TβRII ternary complex were obtained by vapor diffusion in hanging drops at room temperature in 8–15% polyethylene glycol 4000–8000 at pH 6.0–8.0. The complex crystals diffracted to 3.0 Å resolution, belonged to a triclinic space group P1 with cell dimensions a = 37.70 Å, b = 99.35 Å, c = 102.7 Å, α = 64.01°, β = 84.47°, and γ = 84.34°. The x-ray data sets were collected at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team 22-ID Beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Supporting institutions are listed at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team website. The data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (43Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the structures of TGF-β2 (Protein Data Bank code 2TGI), the extracellular domains of TβRII (Protein Data Bank code 1M9Z), and BMPR-Ia (Protein Data Bank code 1REW) as search models. The solutions for TGF-β1 and TβRII were obtained with the program Phaser, and the solution for TβRI was obtained using Evolutionary programming for molecular replacement (44McCoy A.J.

There are two ternary complexes in each asymmetric unit that were modeled using the programs O and COOT (46Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A.

DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Final rounds of the refinement were carried out with phenix.refine (49Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K.

Several programs from CCP4 program suite were used throughout model building and refinement (50Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). Binding studies were performed with a BIAcore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare) and were analyzed using the software package Scrubber2 (Biologic Software). TGF-βs were biotinylated and captured on carboxymethyl dextran (CM5) chips to which 5000 response units (RU) streptavidin had been covalently attached to all four flow cells using an amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare). TGF-β2 was biotinylated in 25 mm MES, pH 4.8, by first activating it with a 10-fold molar excess of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (GE Healthcare) in the presence of a 25-fold molar excess of N-hydroxysuccinimide (GE Healthcare) and then by adding a 100-fold molar excess of amine-PEO3-biotin (Pierce). TGF-β1 and -β3 were biotinylated by first complexing the protein with an excess of TβRII (4 equivalents) or TβRI and TβRII (4 equivalents each) followed by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce). Singly biotinylated TGF-β1 and -β3 were separated from doubly and multiply biotinylated forms by applying them to a Source S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) in the presence of 30% isopropanol at pH 4.0. To ensure the reliability of the results, surface densities of captured TGF-βs were kept at 50–300 RU. TβRII binding data for TGF-β1 and -β3 were collected using ligands that had been modified in the presence of TβRII, whereas TβRI binding data (both alone and in the presence of 4 μm TβRII) were collected using ligands that had been modified in the presence of both TβRI and TβRII. Binding assays were performed by injecting 2-fold serial dilutions of the receptor in duplicate or triplicate in HBS-EP buffer (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of either 5 μl/min (equilibrium experiments for interactions with slow association times) or 50–100 μl/min (equilibrium experiments for interactions with fast association times and kinetic experiments). The surfaces were regenerated by a brief injection of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.5 (30-s contact time at a flow rate of 50–100 μl/min). Instrument noise was removed by referencing the data against at least three blank buffer injections. A very small background signal, caused by the nonspecific absorption of the receptors to the surfaces, was removed by referencing the data against a flow cell containing only immobilized streptavidin. Equilibrium analyses were performed on steady state measurements using the equilibrium binding response near the end of the injection. Kinetic analyses were performed by global fitting with a simple 1:1 model. Standard errors were obtained from the variation among the derived parameters from independent measurements using Origin Software. The structure of a human TGF-β1·TβRI·TβRII ternary complex was determined to 3.0-Å resolution (Table 1). One TGF-β1 homodimer binds to two TβRI and two TβRII receptors forming a 2:2:2 complex (Fig. 1). Each asymmetric unit contains two complexes related by a NCS 2-fold symmetry. Electron densities for all 112 residues in both chains of TGF-β1 homodimer, for residues 20–126 of TβRII, and for residues 9–85 of TβRI were well defined except for two loop regions of TβRI between residues 36 and 38 and between residues 64 and 71 that correspond to the tips of finger 2 and finger 3 of the three-finger toxin fold. All interface residues between the three components of the complex were well resolved. The overall assembly of the ternary complex is very similar to the reported structure of TGF-β3·TβRI·TβRII complex (Protein Data Bank code 2PJY) with an r.m.s.d. of 1.14 Å for 357 Cα atoms (supplemental Fig. S1) (7Groppe J. Hinck C.S. Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Zubieta C. Schuermann J.P. Taylor A.B. Schwarz P.M. Wrana J.L. Hinck A.P. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the center of the complex, butterfly-like shaped TGF-β1 homodimer (TGF-β1A and TGF-β1B subunits) interacts with two TβRII and two TβRI receptors (Fig. 1). The structure of the TGF-β monomer was originally described as a slightly curved left hand with α1 and α3 helixes forming the thumb and the heel of the hand and two antiparallel β-sheets forming its four fingers (13Daopin S. Piez K.A. Ogawa Y. Davies D.R. Science. 1992; 257: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Both receptors TβRI and TβRII demonstrate three-finger toxin fold with some differences in the shape, length, and secondary structure of their first and third fingers. The ternary complex defines three pairwise interaction interfaces between TGF-β1 and TβRI, TGF-β1 and TβRII, and between TβRI and TβRII, burying 1518-, 940-, and 740-Å2 solvent-accessible areas, respectively. There are no significant conformational changes in TGF-β and TβRII upon complex formation. Superposition of the current receptor with the unbound TβRII (Protein Data Bank code 1M9Z) resulted in an r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å for 100 Cα atoms. Similarly, the receptor-bound TGF-β1 can be superimposed with unbound TGF-β1 (minimized average NMR structure, Protein Data Bank code 1KLC), TGF-β2 (Protein Data Bank code 2TGI), and TGF-β3 (Protein Data Bank codes 1TGK and 1TGJ), resulting in an r.m.s.d. of 0.9–1.5 Å for 100–109 Cα atoms.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupP1Unit cell (Å)a = 37.70, b = 99.35, c = 102.7, α = 64.01°, β = 84.47°, γ = 84.34°Resolution limit (Å)3.0Unique reflections23,426 (1223)dThe values in parentheses are for highest resolution shell 3.11-3.00 Å.Redundancy1.9 (1.6)Completeness (%)87.9 (44.9)Rsym (%)aRsym = 100 × Σ|Ih − <Ih>|/SIh, where <Ih> is the mean intensity of multiple measurements of symmetry equivalent reflections.8.0 (24.5)<I/σI>9.2 (2.0)RefinementResolution (Å)46.0-3.0No. reflections22,145No. protein atomsbTotal number of atoms in one asymmetric unit, which contains two complexes.

Open table in a new tab The type I receptor contacts both monomers of TGF-β1, generating two primarily hydrophobic patches of the interface burying 370 and 1150 Å2 of accessible-solvent area with TGF-β1A and TGF-β1B, respectively (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S1). The interface between TGF-β1A and TβRI consists of Trp30, Trp32, Tyr90, and Leu101 of the “palm” side of TGF-β1A fingers and Ile54, Pro55, and Phe60 from TβRI. This interface is well conserved in the structure of TGF-β3 ternary complex as well as among the sequences of three TGF-β isoforms (Figs. 3A and 4A). The second patch consists of Ala1, Leu2, Asn5, and Tyr6 from α1-helix and Ile51, Gln57, and Lys60 from α3-helix of TGF-β1B contacting His15, Leu16, Lys19, Phe31, Ile54, and Val61 from TβRI with one hydrogen bond between the side chain of Tyr6 of TGF-β1 and His15 of TβRI. Interestingly, in the TGF-β3 ternary complex structure, TβRI is rotated ∼10° away from TGF-β as calculated by program HINGE (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1B) (24Snyder G.A. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3864-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), resulting in a partial solvent exposure and a 400-Å2 reduction of buried solvent-accessible area at this interface between TβRI and TGF-β3B. There is, however, one hydrophobic interaction between Thr67 of TGF-β3B and Val71 of TβRI, which is absent in current TGF-β1 complex because of a partial disorder of β4-β5 loop around Val71 of TβRI.FIGURE 3Structural superposition between TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 ternary complexes.

However, both the identity and position of interface residues vary considerably between the type I receptors (Fig. 4), suggesting a promiscuous recognition at Site I. Nevertheless, no cross-reactivity was observed between BMPR-Ia and TβRI (1Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S.

The current structure points to the new area of interactions between the N-terminal loop of TβRI (β1-β2 loop) and the α1-helix of TGF-β1. The corresponding loop in BMPR-Ia contains insertions that potentially would hinder BMPR-Ia binding to the α1-helix of TGF-β (Fig. 5A). This α1-helix is stabilized by a Cys7–Cys16 disulfide bond in TGF-βs but is either absent or disordered in the structures of all BMPs, activin, and growth differentiation factor 5 (5Allendorph G.P.

Interestingly, ALK1 and ALK2 also have a short β1-β2 loop that correlates with their permissive recognition of both TGF-βs and BMPs. The interactions between TGF-β1 and TβRII involve five TGF-β1 residues (Arg25, His34, Tyr91, Gly93, and Arg94) at the tips of its fingers and seven TβRII residues (Phe30, Asp32, Ser49, Ile50, Ser52, Ile53, and Glu119) on the base of the toxin-fold fingers of the receptor (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S1). Although Arg94 and Tyr91 of TGF-β1 form hydrophobic contacts with Ile50, Ile53, and Phe30 of TβRII, the majority of the interactions at this interface are either salt bridges or hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S1). In particular, Arg25 and Arg94 of TGF-β1 form salt bridges with Glu119 and Asp32 of TβRII, respectively, that are also conserved in TβRII·TGF-β3 binary and TβRI·TBRII·TGF-β3 ternary complexes (Fig. 3C). A major structural difference between the TGF-β and BMP receptor complexes is the association with their respective type II receptors. TβRII and ActRII not only bind to different sites on their ligands, Site IIa and IIb, respectively, they also use distinct residues for their ligand recognition (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5B). TβRII contacts TGF-β via residues from β1- and β2-strands. The secondary structure conformation of this receptor region is stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys38 and Cys44 that is unique to TβRII. The corresponding region in all other type II receptors, including BMPRII and ActRII, lacks both β1′, β1″-strands and the Cys38–Cys44 disulfide bond. It would result in a conformation that would sterically clash with their cytok"

https://openalex.org/W2040267422,"During a screen for humoral factors that promote cardiomyocyte differentiation from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we found marked elevation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) mRNA in developing cardiomyocytes. We confirmed that both G-CSFR and G-CSF were specifically expressed in embryonic mouse heart at the midgestational stage, and expression levels were maintained throughout embryogenesis. Intrauterine G-CSF administration induced embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and caused hyperplasia. In contrast, approximately 50% of csf3r–/– mice died during late embryogenesis because of the thinning of atrioventricular walls. ESC-derived developing cardiomyocytes also strongly expressed G-CSFR. When extrinsic G-CSF was administered to the ESC- and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, it markedly augmented their proliferation. Moreover, G-CSF-neutralizing antibody inhibited their proliferation. These findings indicated that G-CSF is critically involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation during development, and may be used to boost the yield of cardiomyocytes from ESCs for their potential application to regenerative medicine."

It represents a paradigm for ciliopathies, a class of genetic disorders sharing the common etiology of basal body and/or cilia dysfunction (5Badano J.L. Mitsuma N. Beales P.L. Katsanis N. Annu. Rev.

The physiological relevance of cilia, the motile and/or sensory organelles present on most vertebrate cell types, is emphasized by the growing number of pleiotropic diseases belonging to this class, which in addition to BBS includes the closely related Alström syndrome, as well Meckel syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Senior-Løken syndrome.

Once thought to be a vestigial organelle, the nonmotile (primary) cilium is now well established as being essential for the transduction of chemical, visual, and mechanical sensory stimuli, and its receptor-studded membrane orchestrates a number of important signaling cascades necessary for vertebrate development, including Hedgehog, Wnt, and PDGFRαα signaling (6Fliegauf M.

Veland I.R. Schrøder J.M. Christensen S.T. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 1993-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The microtubule-based ciliary axoneme is assembled at the distal end of a basal body, a structure derived from the mother centriole that docks at the plasma membrane prior to ciliogenesis (13Marshall W.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Santos N. Reiter J.F. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 1972-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nearly all cilia are built and maintained by a multiprotein intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery that mobilizes ciliary cargo, for example structural components, receptors, and signaling molecules, into the organelle via an anterograde kinesin motor and transports components back to the base by way of a retrograde dynein motor (15Blacque O.E.

J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The IFT machinery is thought to dock near the tips of the transitional fibers, which are structures of unknown composition that form a nine-membered pinwheel-like radial array that joins the distal end of the basal body to the ciliary membrane (19Deane J.A.

Besharse J.C. Vis. Res. 2008; 48: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Near this site, effectively a “ciliary gate,” post-Golgi trafficking of vesicular cargoes destined for the cilium terminates by fusion with the membrane; the transport of the released cargoes into the organelle may then be facilitated by the IFT machinery (21Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Few cellular factors are known to participate in the functional transition from vesicular trafficking to ciliary trafficking (24Leroux M.R. Cell. 2007; 129: 1041-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or, potentially, in the reverse process where ciliary components are trafficked out of the organelle. Although ciliary trafficking is nonvesicular, it relies on IFT protein subunits that share β-propeller/solenoid topologies (and ostensibly functions) similar to those of coat vesicle-associated proteins (23Silverman M.A. Leroux M.R.

Our group previously discovered a member of the ARF-like family of small GTPases, ARL6, that could conceivably possess such a trafficking function. ARL6 is associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 3 (BBS3) (27Chiang A.P. Nishimura D. Searby C. Elbedour K. Carmi R. Ferguson A.L. Secrist J. Braun T. Casavant T. Stone E.M. Sheffield V.C. Am. J.

Invest. 2009; 119: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans sensory cilia, ARL6 was shown to undergo IFT (28Fan Y. Esmail M.A. Ansley S.J. Blacque O.E.

Moreover, ARF-like proteins, which are generally implicated in membrane trafficking and regulation of microtubule-associated processes (29Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol.

ARL3 orthologues from Leishmania, C. elegans, and mice are associated with cilia/ciliary photoreceptor functions (33Cuvillier A. Redon F. Antoine J.C. Chardin P. DeVos T. Merlin G. J.

Cell. 2007; 12: 767-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The exclusive presence of ARL6 in organisms that possess cilia and its association with IFT (28Fan Y. Esmail M.A. Ansley S.J. Blacque O.E. Boroevich K. Ross A.J. Moore S.J. Badano J.L. May-Simera H. Compton D.S. Green J.S. Lewis R.A. van Haelst M.M. Parfrey P.S. Baillie D.L. Beales P.L. Katsanis N. Davidson W.S. Leroux M.R. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) therefore suggests a potential role for this small GTPase in coordinating or facilitating the functional bridging of intraciliary trafficking with vesicular trafficking. Although all BBS proteins studied to date appear to play important roles in either trafficking cargo to the basal body/centrosome or within cilia via IFT (2Blacque O.E. Leroux M.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2145-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), ARL6/BBS3 is suggested to have a potentially distinct function from that of a core group of BBS proteins that assemble into a complex, termed the BBSome (37Nachury M.V. Loktev A.V. Zhang Q. Westlake C.J. Peränen J. Merdes A. Slusarski D.C. Scheller R.H. Bazan J.F. Sheffield V.C. Jackson P.K. Cell. 2007; 129: 1201-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). This notion arises from the finding that the BBSome, which consists of a biochemically separable protein complex containing BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, and BBS9 proteins, does not co-fractionate with BBS3 in a sucrose gradient (37Nachury M.V. Loktev A.V. Zhang Q. Westlake C.J. Peränen J. Merdes A. Slusarski D.C. Scheller R.H. Bazan J.F. Sheffield V.C. Jackson P.K. Cell. 2007; 129: 1201-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one component of the BBSome (BBS1) interacts with Rabin8, a GDP/GTP exchange factor for the small GTPase RAB8. Rabin8 co-localizes with the BBSome at the centrosome/basal body and affects the nucleotide cycling of RAB8, which enters the cilium in its GTP-bound state and is necessary for ciliogenesis (37Nachury M.V. Loktev A.V. Zhang Q. Westlake C.J. Peränen J. Merdes A. Slusarski D.C. Scheller R.H. Bazan J.F. Sheffield V.C. Jackson P.K. Cell. 2007; 129: 1201-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). RAB8 was also recently shown to interact with Rabaptin5, which localizes at the basal body, and associates with an IFT protein termed Elipsa/DYF-11 (38Li C. Inglis P.N. Leitch C.C. Efimenko E. Zaghloul N.A. Mok C.A. Davis E.E. Bialas N.J. Healey M.P. Héon E. Zhen M. Swoboda P. Katsanis N. Leroux M.R. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000044Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39Omori Y. Zhao C. Saras A. Mukhopadhyay S. Kim W. Furukawa T. Sengupta P. Veraksa A. Malicki J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Given the well established role of Rabaptin5 as a RAB5 effector in endocytosis, it was suggested that this Rabaptin5-RAB8-Elipsa/DYF-11 trio may provide critical functional interactions between the ciliary membrane (or vesicles associated with cilia) and the IFT machinery (39Omori Y. Zhao C. Saras A. Mukhopadhyay S. Kim W. Furukawa T. Sengupta P. Veraksa A. Malicki J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, RAB-5 itself was shown to concentrate at the base of cilia together with an early endosome-associated STAM-Hrs complex that regulates polycystin-1/polycystin-2 protein removal from cilia (40Hu J. Wittekind S.G. Barr M.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3277-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). How BBSome proteins, which are themselves associated with both the basal body and IFT, participate in this basal body-ciliary sorting-trafficking process remains elusive, and the role of BBS3, potentially distinct from core BBSome components, is presently unknown. To shed light on the molecular and cellular functions of ARL6/BBS3, we first determined the crystal structure of the GTP-bound form of the human protein. The ARL6/BBS3 structure represents the first to be solved for a BBS or IFT protein and displays unique characteristics not found in other small GTPases. In combination with GTP binding functional assays, the structure demonstrates how single-residue mutations uncovered in BBS patients abrogate nucleotide binding and thus protein function. Furthermore, we now demonstrate that ARL6 in ciliated mammalian cells localizes to the distal end basal bodies, near or at transition fibers, and thus in close proximity to the site of vesicle docking/fusion at the base of cilia. Consistent with a role for ARL6 at this subcellular location, we show that disrupting its cellular function, via overproduction of GDP- or GTP-locked forms, leads to ciliary anomalies in vivo. Furthermore, excess cellular wild-type ARL6 causes an up-regulation of Wnt signaling. Importantly, this effect is not observed with pathogenic variants of ARL6/BBS3. Together, our findings reveal that a BBS protein not directly (or tightly) associated with the BBSome localizes to a novel site within the basal body region, where it may regulate cilia (dis)assembly and, perhaps as a result, subsequent ciliary signaling events. We propose that ARL6/BBS3 may perform this role by modulating membrane trafficking at the base of the ciliary organelle. For the crystallography studies, amino acid residues 16–186 of ARL6 from the Mammalian Genome Collection clone (Geneservice Coordinate AT30-A7) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pET28a-LIC vector (GI:145307000), using the In-Fusion PCR cloning system (Clontech). The construct was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene), and the cells were grown at 37 °C in Terrific Broth to an A600 of 3.0 using the LEX bubbling system. The water bath was lowered to 15 °C for 30 min prior to induction using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then left at 15 °C overnight. To harvest, cells were centrifuged, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The thawed cell pellets from 1.8 liters of culture were resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% CHAPS and lysed with microfluidizer at 20,000 p.s.i. Cleared supernatant was passed through an anion exchange column DE52 (Whatman) pre-equilibrated with the lysis buffer and then loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare) column also pre-equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The target protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient from 50 to 500 mm in 50 ml. The eluted protein fractions were collected, pooled, and further purified by a gel filtration (Superdex 75) column pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Collected protein fractions were adjusted to contain 5 mm MgCl2 and then incubated with 5× protein molarity concentration of GDP for 1 h. The protein was then concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter to a final concentration of 79.2 mg/ml. The purified protein had a mass of 21,354.8 Da. Diffracting crystals were grown using sitting drop vaporization at room temperature. The mother liquor contained 2 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 5.5. Mountable crystal appeared after 2 days. Diffraction data were collected at a copper rotating anode source (RIGAKU FR-E) and processed using the HKL2000 (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were used for expression of untagged (pRSET) or GST-tagged (pGEX) wild-type and mutant ARL6. Transformed E. coli cells were cultured in 50 ml of LB broth containing 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until A600 = 0.6. Cultures were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at room temperature. To harvest, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, suspended in wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Tween 20, 4 μm ATP), and lysed by sonication. Soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. GTP binding assays were done as described previously (50Ding M. Vitale N. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J.

To assay the soluble fraction, 10 μl of lysate were spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, which was then washed in wash buffer and allowed to incubate for 2 h at room temperature in binding buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Tween 20, 4 μm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2) with 2 μCi of GTP/ml. Following binding, the membrane was rinsed in wash buffer and exposed to film or a phosphor screen. To assay the pellet fraction, protein was suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was soaked in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 20% glycerol for 30 min at room temperature, and liquid was transferred onto nitrocellulose. TLC was done as described previously (50Ding M.

Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) was used to maintain HEK-293 cells, and a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) was used for growing IMCD3 and hTERT-RPE cells. Both types of media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and all cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For drug treatments, nocodazole was suspended in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml for 1 h or overnight. The myc-tagged p50 dynamitin expression construct was a kind gift from Richard Vallee (Columbia University) and was transfected into IMCD3 cells using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, as were all other constructs used. For all immunocytochemistry experiments, cells were grown on glass coverslips and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline prior to fixation. The cells were fixed either by a 10-min incubation in −20 °C methanol, followed by a 10-min rehydration in TBS-T (20 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), or by a 30-min fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde in PHEM (0.05 m Pipes, 0.025 m HEPES, 0.01 m EGTA, 0.01 m MgCl2, pH 7.2), followed by a 2-min extraction with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PHEM. After fixation, cells were either blocked for 1 h in TBS-T supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin prior to primary antibody incubation or directly incubated for 60 min at room temperature with the relevant primary antibody diluted in TBS-T. Cells were then washed in TBS-T and incubated another 60 min in the appropriate secondary antibody. Nuclei were counterstained by incubating the glass coverslips in 100 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min in TBS-T at room temperature. Slides were mounted in Prolong anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes) and observed by fluorescence microscopy using standard epifluorescence, Leica LSM 410 confocal, or Leica TCS SP confocal microscope systems. Immunofluorescent digital confocal microscopy and deconvolution were performed as described previously (52Ou Y. Rattner J.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry of mouse tissue was performed on mouse testis embedded in OCT and quick frozen prior to sectioning. Mouse kidney sections were obtained from INOVA Diagnostics, San Diego (catalogue no. 508385), and monkey brain sections were obtained from MeDiCA, Encinitas, CA (catalogue no. 0608-BR). Staining and imaging were done as described above for mammalian tissue culture cells. Primary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry included anti-ARL6C and anti-ARL6N (Abgent), anti-γ-tubulin (Sigma), anti-acetylated tubulin (Sigma), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), and anti-PCM1 (gift from Dr. Andreas Merdes, University of Edinburgh). Secondary antibodies used included rabbit and mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 (Molecular Probes). Differences in cilia length were calculated using the Student's t test, whereas differences in percentage of cells with cilia were calculated using the χ2 test. HEK-293T cells stably expressing pTOPflash reporter (53Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H.

After 24 h, cells were transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA (Renilla luciferase control, plasmid of interest, and pTOPflash reporter plasmid where necessary) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The BBS3 wild-type and mutant alleles were cloned into a pCMV and a pcDNA 6.2 green fluorescent protein backbone and tested with appropriate control vectors, respectively. The cells were stimulated with Wnt3a conditioned medium (54Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates 3rd, J.R. Nusse R.

The luciferase activity was measured using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) on a Tecan Genios Pro luminometer and BMG LabTech FLUOstar Omega plate reader. To illuminate the molecular function of ARL6/BBS3 and facilitate structure-function studies, we determined the high resolution structure of this small GTPase. Using a standard sitting drop vaporization method, we obtained crystals diffracting at up to 2 Å resolution for an N-terminal truncated form of ARL6 (residues 16–186) in the GTP-bound state (ARL6-GTP) (Table 1). The crystal structure of the protein was then solved by molecular replacement, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The structure of the ARL6-BBS3-GTP complex shows a typical GTPase fold with a central six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices (Fig. 1A), but it is distinct from most small GTPases that typically hydrolyze bound GTP and are often found in the GDP-bound state. Despite the similarities of ARL6-GTP to other Ras superfamily small GTPases in the GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue-bound states, including the conformations of five conserved G-box (G1–5) sequences (55Bourne H.R.

During brain development, embryonic MGE cells migrate into the striatum and neocortex where they mature into GABAergic interneurons and play a key role in establishing the balance between excitation and inhibition. Unlike most other embryonic neurons, MGE cells retain the capacity for migration and integration when transplanted into the postnatal and adult brain. We performed MGE cell transplantation into the basal ganglia of control and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Transplanted MGE cells survived, differentiated into GABA+ neurons, integrated into host circuitry, and modifed motor behavior in both lesioned and control rats. Our data suggest that MGE cell transplantation into the striatum is a promising approach to investigate the potential benefits of remodeling basal ganglia circuitry in neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2094920355,"FOXO transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved proteins that orchestrate gene expression programs known to control a variety of cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair and protection from oxidative stress. As the abrogation of FOXO function is a key feature of many tumor cells, regulation of FOXO factors is receiving increasing attention in cancer research. In order to discover genes involved in the regulation of FOXO activity, we performed a large-scale RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) screen using cell-based reporter systems that monitor transcriptional activity and subcellular localization of FOXO. We identified genes previously implicated in phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling events, which are known to be important for FOXO function. In addition, we discovered a previously unrecognized FOXO-repressor function of TRIB2, the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila gene tribbles. A cancer-profiling array revealed specific overexpression of TRIB2 in malignant melanoma, but not in other types of skin cancer. We provide experimental evidence that TRIB2 transcript levels correlate with the degree of cytoplasmic localization of FOXO3a. Moreover, we show that TRIB2 is important in the maintenance of the oncogenic properties of melanoma cells, as its silencing reduces cell proliferation, colony formation and wound healing. Tumor growth was also substantially reduced upon RNAi-mediated TRIB2 knockdown in an in vivo melanoma xenograft model. Our studies suggest that TRIB2 provides the melanoma cells with growth and survival advantages through the abrogation of FOXO function. Altogether, our results show the potential of large-scale cell-based RNAi screens to identify promising diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2153074560,"In pathological conditions, F(0)F(1)-ATPase hydrolyzes ATP in an attempt to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential. Using thermodynamic assumptions and computer modeling, we established that mitochondrial membrane potential can be more negative than the reversal potential of the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) but more positive than that of the F(0)F(1)-ATPase. Experiments on isolated mitochondria demonstrated that, when the electron transport chain is compromised, the F(0)F(1)-ATPase reverses, and the membrane potential is maintained as long as matrix substrate-level phosphorylation is functional, without a concomitant reversal of the ANT. Consistently, no cytosolic ATP consumption was observed using plasmalemmal K(ATP) channels as cytosolic ATP biosensors in cultured neurons, in which their in situ mitochondria were compromised by respiratory chain inhibitors. This finding was further corroborated by quantitative measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption, and extracellular acidification rates, indicating nonreversal of ANT of compromised in situ neuronal and astrocytic mitochondria; and by bioluminescence ATP measurements in COS-7 cells transfected with cytosolic- or nuclear-targeted luciferases and treated with mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors in the presence of glycolytic plus mitochondrial vs. only mitochondrial substrates. Our findings imply the possibility of a rescue mechanism that is protecting against cytosolic/nuclear ATP depletion under pathological conditions involving impaired respiration. This mechanism comes into play when mitochondria respire on substrates that support matrix substrate-level phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2087619081,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) caused by amyloid β (Aß) deposition around brain microvessels results in vascular degenerative changes. Antiangiogenic Aß properties are known to contribute to the compromised cerebrovascular architecture. Here we hypothesize that Aß peptides impair angiogenesis by causing endothelial cells to enter senescence at an early stage of vascular development. Wild-type (WT) Aß and its mutated variant E22Q peptide, endowed with marked vascular tropism, were used in this study. In vivo, in zebrafish embryos, the WT or E22Q peptides reduced embryo survival with an IC50 of 6.1 and 4.7 μM, respectively. The 2.5 μM concentration, showing minimal toxicity, was chosen. Alkaline phosphatase staining revealed disorganized vessel patterning, narrowing, and reduced branching of vessels. ß-Galactosidase staining and the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21 expression, indicative of senescence, were increased. In vitro, WT and E22Q reduced endothelial cell survival with an IC50 of 12.3 and 8.8 μM, respectively. The 5 μM concentration, devoid of acute effects on the endothelium, was applied chronically to long-term cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We observed reduced cumulative population doubling, which coincided with ß-galactosidase accumulation, down-regulation of telomerase reversetranscriptase mRNA expression, decreased telomerase activity, and p21 activation. Senescent HUVECs showed marked angiogenesis impairment, as Aß treatment reduced tube sprouting. The endothelial injuries caused by the E22Q peptide were much more aggressive than those induced by the WT peptide. Premature Aß-induced senescence of the endothelium, producing progressive alterations of microvessel morphology and functions, may represent one of the underlying mechanisms for sporadic or heritable CAA.—Donnini, S., Solito, R., Cetti, E., Corti, F., Giachetti, A., Carra, S., Beltrame, M., Cotelli, F., Ziche, M.

A genetic mutation within its MSP domain, P56S, was identified in familial forms of motor neuron diseases. This mutation induces the formation of insoluble VAP-B(P56S) protein aggregates by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we defined the structural requirements for VAP-B oligomerization and demonstrated their contribution for VAP-B(P56S) aggregation and neurotoxicity. We show that the oligomerization of VAP-B is mainly mediated by its coiled-coil domain and that the GXXXG dimerization motif within the transmembrane domain mediates transmembrane domains self-association but is insufficient to drive VAP-B oligomerization. We further show that the oligomerization of the wild-type VAP-B is independent of its MSP domain. However, we found that the P56S mutation induces conformational changes within the MSP domain and facilitates its propensity to aggregate by exposing hydrophobic patches to the solvent. These conformational changes have no direct effect on FFAT binding. Rather, they enhance VAP-B(P56S) oligomerization driven by the combined contributions of the coiled-coil and the transmembrane domains, thereby preventing accessibility to FFAT-binding site, facilitating the production of VAP-B(P56S)-insoluble aggregates and consequently its neurotoxicity.

Atypical ALS type 8 is an autosomal dominant slowly progressive disorder characterized by fasciculation, cramps, and postural tremor. It is currently unknown how this P56S mutation induces motor neuron degeneration. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that the VAP-B(P56S) mutant acts in a dominant fashion through dimerization with the wild-type protein and inactivating the heterodimer and that expression of the VAP-B(P56S) mutant induces the formation of insoluble protein aggregates (7Nishimura A.L.

Indeed, co-expression studies suggest that wild-type VAP-B is recruited to the P56S aggregates and that this recruitment leads either to loss of its unfolded protein response-associated activity (11Kanekura K.

The wild-type VAP-B is a type II integral ER-membrane protein that shares high sequence identity (63%) and a similar primary organization with VAP-A. The two VAPs consist of a large N-terminal region facing the cytoplasm and a hydrophobic C terminus that functions as a transmembrane domain (TMD) (16Skehel P.A. Fabian-Fine R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic region contains a conserved N-terminal MSP (major sperm protein) domain of 125 amino acids (aa), and a coiled-coil domain (CCD) of ∼50 aa. Proline 56 resides within a highly conserved sequence of 16 aa in the MSP domain in a cis-peptide bond conformation; therefore, the serine substitution induces its cis-to-trans isomerization (10Teuling E.

This interaction recruits FFAT motif-containing proteins to the ER membranes and is thought to facilitate lipid transport between the ER, where various lipids are synthesized, to other cellular membranes. We have previously shown using cross-linking experiments and sucrose-density gradient analysis that VAP-B undergoes dimerization and perhaps further oligomerization (2Amarilio R. Ramachandran S. Sabanay H. Lev S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5934-5944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Yet, the structural requirements for VAP-B oligomerization were analyzed either by in vitro binding studies, or by using truncated mutants of different structural domains. Accordingly, it was proposed that the MSP, CCD, and the TMD contribute to VAP oligomerization in the following order of importance: TMD > MSP > CCD (30Nishimura Y. Hayashi M. Inada H. Tanaka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Further studies have demonstrated a weak interaction between a TMD-truncated mutant and a full-length wild-type VAP-B protein, which was enhanced by the P56S mutation (11Kanekura K. Nishimoto I. Aiso S. Matsuoka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30223-30233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki H. Kanekura K. Levine T.P. Kohno K. Olkkonen V.M. Aiso S. Matsuoka M. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 973-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, this TMD-truncated mutant was localized to the cytosol rather than the ER membranes. In this study, we used spectroscopic measurements and demonstrate that the P56S mutation induces conformational changes in the MSP domain, leading to an exposure of hydrophobic patches to the solvent and to MSP aggregation. Further studies on the wild-type VAP-B and its P56S mutant in intact cells revealed: (i) that the coiled-coil domain is critical for VAP-B oligomerization, (ii) that the GXXXG dimerization motif within the TMD is sufficient for driving oligomerization of the TMDs but not of the full-length protein, (iii) that the P56S mutation enhances VAP-B oligomerization driven by the coiled-coil and transmembrane domains, thereby impairing FFAT binding, and (iv) that the production of insoluble VAP-B(P56S) aggregates correlates with its neurotoxic effects. These results provide molecular insights into the mechanism underlying VAP-B(P56S) oligomerization and its implication in VAP-B(P56S) pathology. Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa-488 donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Monoclonal anti-α-tubulin and 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Point mutations within the human VAP-B cDNA were introduced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The following VAP-B point mutants were established: P56S, G235I (I), G235/G239I (II), and K87/M89D (DD). The different VAP-B cDNAs, wild-type and mutants, were subcloned into pCMV-neo-Myc, pCAN-Myc, or pCMV-neo-HA mammalian expression vectors. Truncated VAP-B mutants were produced by subcloning of corresponding PCR products into the above expression vectors or pEYFP-C1 harboring the A206K mutation (monomeric). The following sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were used to establish the indicated truncated mutants: ΔMSP (aa 126–243): 5′-CGCGGATCCCCAGCAGAGAATGATAAACC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATATCCTACAAGGCAATCTTCCCAAT-3′; TMD (aa 201–243): 5′-GCCGGATCCACAGTGCAGAGCAACAGCCCC-3 and 5′-CGGGATATCCTACAAGGCAATCTTCCCAAT-3′; MSP (aa 1–125): 5′-CTCAGTGCATATGGCGAAGGTGGAGCAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATATCCTACAATTCAAACACACATCTAAG-3′. The MSP domain was also subcloned into the pET-14b bacterial expression vector (Novagen) to produce a recombinant protein containing an N-terminal His6 tag. The ΔCC (aa Δ159–196) mutant was constructed using three PCR steps. The first two PCR products correspond to the 5′ and 3′ DNA sequences upstream and downstream of the CCD. Each of these PCR products consists of complementary sequences flanking the boundaries of the CCD. Annealing of these two PCR products and further amplification with primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ sequence of the full-length VAP-B results in the production of the ΔCC mutant. The following set of sense and antisense primers have been used: for 5′ amplification: 5′-CCGGGATCCGCGAAGGTGGAGCA-3′; 5′-CTGTCTTCCTCATCCGACTCAGAGACTTAGACAC-3′; for 3′ amplification: 5′-GTGTCTAAGTCTCTGAGTCGGATGAGGAAGACAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATATCCTACAAGGCAATCTTCCCAAT-3′. For full-length amplification: 5′-CCGGGATCCGCGAAGGTGGAGCA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATATCCTACAAGGCAATCTTCCCAAT-3′. The cDNA of Myc-tagged wild-type VAP-B, VAP-B(P56S), or the VAP-B(P56S)/ΔCC/II mutant was subcloned into pCSC-SP-PW-IRES/GFP lentiviral vector. HeLa and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The same medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine was used to grow Neuro2A cells. The cells were transfected with DNA constructs using the calcium phosphate method. Lentiviruses were produced in HEK293T packaging cells as follows: subconfluent (80%) HEK293T cells in 10-cm-diameter tissue culture plates were co-transfected with pMDL-g/p-RRE (HIV gag/pol) packaging plasmid, the rev expression plasmid pRSV-REV, and pCMV VSV-G envelope plasmid together with pCSC-SP-PW-IRES/GFP carrying the cDNA of either Myc-tagged wild-type VAP-B, the P56S mutant, or the P56S/ΔCC/II. Sixteen hours later, the medium was changed and viruses were collected 48 h later. Viral supernatants were filtered through 0.45-μm pore size filters and stored at −80 °C. Neuro2A cells were incubated in lentiviral supernatants containing 25% fresh complete medium and 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h. The infection efficiency was assessed by immunofluorescence analysis and was found to be >90%. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm NaVO3, 20 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatants using the indicated antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The samples were then separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Transfected HEK293 cells grown in 60-mm tissue culture plates were incubated with 1% formaldehyde (stock solution, 37%) for 10 min at room temperature. The formaldehyde was then quenched by 125 mm glycine for 5 min. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm NaVO3, and protease inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged as described below. For Fig. 4A, after washing with PBS, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 200 μm NaVO3, 20 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors) containing 0.2% SDS, passed through a 21-gauge syringe ten times, boiled for 5 min, and passed again through the syringe as above. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The samples were then incubated in SDS-sample buffer and boiled either for 1 min or for 30 min to reverse cross-linking. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Transfected HeLa cells were grown on coverslips, washed with PBS, and fixed either in methanol for 1 h at −20 °C, or in paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and immunostained as described previously (31Litvak V. Dahan N. Ramachandran S. Sabanay H. Lev S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The specimens were analyzed by a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss 510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using the 488, 543, 405, and 633 nm excitations for fluorescein, Cy3 epifluorescence, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and Cy5, respectively. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Neuro2A cells were seeded in 6-wells plate at 60% confluency (day 0) and on the following day (day 1) were infected with lentiviruses. 48 h following infection (day 3), the cells were split into 24-well plate for future MTT assays or seeded on polylysine-coated glass coverslips for neurite outgrowth quantification. The growth medium was then replaced by differentiation medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, antibiotics, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (day 4). At days 5 and 6, 96 and 120 h following infection (24 and 48 h after serum deprivation), cell viability was measured by MTT assay as previously described (32Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46504) Google Scholar). At day 5, the cells on the glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and co-immunostained with polyclonal anti-Myc antibody to detect protein expression and monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody to assess full-length neurites. 25 random areas were selected in blind, and z-stack images were acquired using a 63× oil objective. The infected cells were categorized into three different populations; round, cells with short neurites, and differentiated cells possessing long neurites; at least 3-fold longer of the cell body. Average values and standard deviations of two different experiments from different days were calculated. Fluorescence emission spectra were acquired with a Cary Varian Eclipse instrument, equipped with a Peltier temperature control set for all measurements at 20 °C. Intrinsic aromatic fluorescence emission spectra of proteins (0.05 mg/ml concentration in 50 mm KPi, pH 8, buffer) were acquired between 300 and 400 nm after excitation at 280 nm (excitation slit, 5 nm; emission slit, 10 nm). ANS binding assays were used as an extrinsic fluorescence probe to detect the hydrophobic exposure of the domain (33McClure W.O. Edelman G.M. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1908-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 34Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). A 20-fold molar excess of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (1,8-ANS) was added to the samples (0.05 mg/ml concentration in 50 mm KPi, pH 8, buffer), and ANS fluorescence emission enhancement was evaluated upon excitation at 370 nm, after 60-min incubation in the dark. CD measurements were recorded on a JASCO J-815 spectrometer equipped with a Peltier-thermostatted cell. Far UV-CD spectra of VAP-MSP (0.1 mg/ml protein in 50 mm KPi, pH 8, buffer) were recorded at 20 °C using a 1-mm path length cell (Hellma) and represent an average of ten scans. For CD analysis of thermal transitions, the temperature was raised from 20 to 70 °C at 0.5 °C/min, monitoring the spectroscopic signal at 222 nm (0.4 mg/ml protein in 50 mm KPi, pH 8, buffer). Curve fitting assuming a sigmoid two-state model allowed the determination of the melting temperature (Tm). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out in a Malvern Zetasizer nano ZS instrument, equipped with a 4-megawatt He-Ne laser (632 nm). Samples were directly filtered through a 0.45-μm filter into a 3-mm light path quartz cuvette (Hellma) prior to analysis. Proteins (0.4 mg/ml in 50 mm KPi, pH 8, buffer) were analyzed at different temperatures, after 5-min incubation at each measuring temperature, between 20 to 70 °C. The operating procedure was set to 17 runs, each being averaged for 17 s. Data were analyzed by using DTS software (Malvern) in respect to the distribution of sizes by volume. Thermal aggregation profiles were determined plotting the intensity of aggregates determined by DLS (>100 nm diameter) as a function of temperature. The GXXXG motif, in which two glycine residues are separated by any three amino acids on a helical framework, is recognized as a “dimerization motif,” because it mediates the assembly of two transmembrane helices (35Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 36Brosig B. Langosch D.

Its presence within the TMD of VAP-B (235GXXXG239) prompted us to investigate its contribution to VAP-B oligomerization using mutagenesis studies and cross-linking experiments in intact cells. Replacing glycine 235 (Gly235) with isoleucine (Ile), either alone (G235I) or in combination with Gly239 (G235I/G239I; hereafter termed II), had no apparent effect on VAP-B homo-oligomerization, as determined by cross-linking experiments (Fig. 1A). These mutations also did not affect oligomerization of the VAP-B K87/M89D (DD) mutant, which fails to interact with the FFAT motif (38Kaiser S.E. Brickner J.H. Reilein A.R. Fenn T.D. Walter P. Brunger A.T. Structure. 2005; 13: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The DD mutant, as well as the DD(I) and DD(II) VAP-B mutants, undergo dimerization similar to the wild-type protein. This implies that dimerization of VAP-B is dependent on intrinsic structural properties of VAP-B proteins, rather than its ability to interact with FFAT motif containing proteins. We next assessed the ability of the VAP-B(II) mutant to interact with the wild-type VAP-B (hereafter termed WT) or to undergo homo-dimerization by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 1B, the G235/239I (II) mutations had no effect on either VAP-B(WT) or VAP-B(II) binding. These results suggest that the GXXXG motif is either dispensable or insufficient for driving VAP-B oligomerization. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we selectively expressed the TMD of the wild-type and the G235I/G239I (II) mutant fused to monomeric YFP in mammalian cells and assessed their dimerization by cross-linking studies. Only the TMD of VAP-B(WT) was found as a dimer (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the GXXXG motif mediates the assembly of the transmembrane helices in VAP-B and that other structural motifs are involved in oligomerization of the full-length VAP-B protein. Previous studies using in vitro binding assays have suggested that the MSP domain of VAP-A and/or VAP-B contributes to VAP oligomerization (30Nishimura Y. Hayashi M. Inada H. Tanaka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the MSP domain of VAP-A has been found as a monomer in solution (38Kaiser S.E. Brickner J.H. Reilein A.R. Fenn T.D. Walter P. Brunger A.T. Structure. 2005; 13: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of the MSP domain to VAP-B oligomerization, we expressed an MSP-truncated VAP-B mutant (ΔMSP) fused to either monomeric YFP (ΔMSP-YFP, Fig. 2A) or Myc tag (ΔMSP-Myc, Fig. 2B) in mammalian cells, and assessed their dimerization by cross-linking studies. Deletion of the MSP domain had no apparent effect on oligomerization of either the VAP-B(WT) or the VAP-B(II) mutant. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the ΔMSP mutants (VAP-B-ΔMSP and VAP-B-ΔMSP(II)) strongly interacted with either VAP-B(WT) or the VAP-B(II) mutant (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the MSP has a minor effect on VAP-B oligomerization. This was further supported by cross-linking studies of cells expressing only the MSP domain of either the WT, or the DD or P56S mutants. In all cases, dimerization of the MSP domain was hardly detected (Fig. 2D), suggesting that, under these experimental conditions, the MSP domain of VAP-B does not contribute to VAP-B oligomerization. The α-helical coiled-coil is one of the principal oligomerization motifs in proteins (39Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). We therefore examined its requirement for VAP-B dimerization using coiled-coil-truncated (ΔCC) mutants of VAP-B(WT) and VAP-B(II) proteins (ΔCC and ΔCC/II, respectively). The mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells, and their oligomerization was assessed following cross-linking. As shown, deletion of the coiled-coil domain from the WT protein gradually attenuated its dimerization, and apparently abolished dimerization of the VAP-B(II) mutant (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that"

In the absence of stimuli the open probability of RyR1 is very low, and [Ca2+]rest is maintained near 100 nm in frog (1López J.R. Alamo L. Caputo C. DiPolo R. Vergara S. Biophys.

Part if not all of the Ry-insensitive Ca2+ leak pathway has been proposed to represent a conformation of RyR1 with a low conductance that is constitutively open (PO∼1) and represents a distinct conformation from that of actively gated RyR1 channels involved in excitation contraction coupling (4Yang T.

It has been shown that Ry-insensitive Ca2+ leaks may contribute significantly to SR Ca2+ loading capacity and that they may have a significant contribution to regulation of [Ca2+]rest in skeletal muscle. If this is correct, then RyR1 leak may have relevance in physiological and pathological regulation of muscle Ca2+ homeostasis.Macrocyclic bastadins isolated from the marine sponge Lanthella basta are novel modulators of RyR1. Bastadin 5 (B5) has been shown to prolong dramatically both open and closed time constants of single RyR1 channels reconstituted in bilayer lipid membranes without changing their unitary conductance or overall open probability (11Mack M.M. Molinski T.F. Buck E.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23236-23249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, under conditions where RyR1 channels are pharmacologically blocked (with micromolar ryanodine or ruthenium red) both B5 and its related congener bastadin 10 have been shown to increase significantly the Ca2+ loading capacity in SR vesicles and increase the capacity of SR membranes to bind [3H]Ry ∼4-fold (Bmax) (10Pessah I.N. Molinski T.F. Meloy T.D. Wong P. Buck E.D. Allen P.D. Mohr F.C. Mack M.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1997; 272: C601-C614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We hypothesized that expression of RyR1 in RyR-null (NullRyR) myotubes would increase [Ca2+]rest and that this increase would be secondary to passive Ca2+ efflux from SR stores mediated by Ry-insensitive Ca2+ leak. As expected, expression of RyR1 in NullRyR myotubes increased [Ca2+]rest to concentrations typically found in wild type myotubes, and complete blockade of caffeine sensitive RyR1 Ca2+ release by ryanodine did not modify [Ca2+]rest levels. When B5 was added to examine the contribution of RyR1 leaks toward the [Ca2+]rest, we found that Ry+B5 in combination reduced resting [Ca2+]rest to essentially dyspedic levels in RyR1-expressing cells, but had no effect in NullRyR cells. [Ca2+]rest was further reduced when Ry+B5-pretreated NullRyR and wild type (WtRyR) myotubes were exposed to low external Ca2+ solution. Similar results were obtained in primary myotubes generated from RyR1/3-null dyspedic mice and their wild type littermates. These results show that a fraction of RyR1 within the SR membrane exists in a Ry-insensitive conformation that mediates Ca2+ leak that determines [Ca2+]rest levels in skeletal muscle. In addition, RyR1 expression also regulates basal sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx, which also contributes to [Ca2+]rest in skeletal myotubes.DISCUSSIONThe purpose of this study was to examine whether the expression of RyR1 has any effect on [Ca2+]rest, the resting Ca2+ entry, and SR Ca2+ loading in skeletal muscle. Our study demonstrates that expression of WtRyR1 is associated with a significant increase in [Ca2+]rest, in resting Ca2+ entry, with no significant change in SR Ca2+ loading compared with NullRyR myotubes. The fact that we observed the same results with RyR1-transduced 1B5 myotubes and in primary myotubes rules out the possibility that the observed difference in [Ca2+]rest was related to overexpression of RyR1 when the differentiated myotubes were transduced with virion particles containing wild type RyR1 cDNA. A significant part of this elevation in [Ca2+]rest appears to be related to the presence of RyR1 leaks because Ry+B5 was able to reduce [Ca2+]rest to levels similar to those observed in NullRyR myotubes. In addition, our results show clearly that extracellular Ca2+ also plays an important role in maintaining [Ca2+]rest at physiological levels.From these results it is clear that in addition to the control of well known intracellular Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms (PMCA, NCX, SERCA) on steady-state [Ca2+]rest in skeletal muscle a significant portion of [Ca2+]rest is also set by passive Ca2+ release, which appears to be the result of a fraction of WtRyR1s within SR that are in a Ry-insensitive Ca2+ leak conformation and by the Ca2+ influx via the sarcolemma that is modulated by the presence of RyR1. In fact, the combined effect of expression of RyR1 elevated the [Ca2+]rest by ∼2-fold. The precise mechanism underlying how RyR1 leaks and the expression of the RyR1 lead to a chronic elevation [Ca2+]rest needs further study. If RyR1 leak exceeds Ca2+ uptake by the SR and extrusion by sarcolemmal mechanisms, a new dynamic equilibrium of Ca2+ mobilization must be established that allows the higher [Ca2+]rest. If the currently proposed mechanism that Ca2+extrusion processes of the plasma membrane (PMCA, SERCA, and NCX) control [Ca2+]rest they should be stimulated by elevations in resting [Ca2+]i, and in the steady state, such as those defined by our experimental conditions, these transport mechanisms should be sufficient to compensate for the increased Ca2+ leak/sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry, resulting in a return of [Ca2+]rest toward that measured in NullRyR myotubes. Because this does not happen, then the changes in [Ca2+]rest observed with the expression of RyR1 must involve a modification of the set points of the activity of both SERCA and these sarcolemmal Ca2+ transport mechanisms and/or the amount of expression of such proteins at the SR and plasma membrane. In fact, it was found that expression of RyR1 was accompanied by an increase in the expression of PMCA and a decreased expression of NCX3 and SERCA, all of them linked to the regulation of intracellular [Ca2+]. As modeled in Fig. 8, the decreased expression of SERCA, an increased expression of PMCA, elevated resting Ca2+ entry, and an elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ are the costs for expressing RyR1 and maintaining SR stores at levels equal to that found in dyspedic cells. One explanation is that RyR1-expressing cells down-regulate SERCA as a compensatory adaptation to limit the consumption of ATP that would be needed to offset RyR1-mediated Ca2+ leak from SR. If the level of SERCA expression was maintained in the face of a sizable Ca2+ leak, futile cycling of Ca2+ between the SR lumen and the extracellular space would come at a great energy cost. Conversely, dyspedic cells express higher levels of SERCA because without the RyR1 Ca2+ leak there is a reduced energy cost. One intriguing discovery in the present study is that RyR1 expression appears to confer significant regulation of the density of SERCA protein found in SR membranes. These results are consistent with previous findings that indicated up-regulation of SERCA levels in skeletal muscle membranes isolated from dyspedic mice compared with those isolated from wild type (Fig. 6 in Ref. 24Buck E.D. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7360-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Second, the higher PMCA expression could help offset decreased rates of Ca2+ transient recovery (relaxation) in light of lower SERCA capacity by removing a larger fraction of released Ca2+ during excitation to the extracellular space. Why NCX protein is down-regulated and how it contributes to maintenance of resting Ca2+ are unclear.B5, through its modulatory actions on the FKBP12·RyR1 complex, has been previously shown to increase SR Ca2+ loading capacity and concomitantly attenuate RyR1 Ca2+ leak. This property of the bastadins is the result of their ability to convert Ry-insensitive leak states (RyR1 leak) into ryanodine-sensitive channels (RyR1 Ca2+ channels) (10Pessah I.N. Molinski T.F.

Therefore, in the present study B5 was used to examine the relationship between Ry-sensitive and Ry-insensitive Ca2+ efflux pathways that coexist in the SR of WtRyR1-expressing myotubes. We found that B5 in combination with blocking concentrations of Ry decreased [Ca2+]rest in WtRyR-expressing myotubes by 43% but had no effect in NullRyR myotubes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that bastadins can promote the conversion of RyR1 in the Ry-insensitive Ca2+ leak conformation into Ry-sensitive RyR1 channels. B5 alone, also reduced [Ca2+]rest in WtRyR1-expressing myotubes but to a lesser degree (25%) compared with its effect in combination with Ry (43%) probably because the RyR1 leaks converted into gating channels do not have the same degree of negative control by the DHPR as normal gating channels.Another interesting result is that the resting Ca2+ entry is greater in WtRyR than NullRyR myotubes, suggesting that the magnitude of this entry is modulated by the presence of RyR1. The physiological role of this resting Ca2+ entry is poorly understood, but appears to be independent of resting membrane potential (myotubes polarized based on the Nernst equation for 23 °C) and/or the degree of SR depletion as we showed in Fig. 6, as has been postulated by Kurebayashi and Ogawa (25Kurebayashi N.

In summary, our results demonstrate that that expression of WtRyR1 is associated with an increase in [Ca2+]rest and that in addition to traditionally proposed mechanisms involving SERCA, NCX, and PMCA, [Ca2+]rest in skeletal muscle is determined in part by passive Ca2+ leak through WtRyR1 and increased basal sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry.

Part if not all of the Ry-insensitive Ca2+ leak pathway has been proposed to represent a conformation of RyR1 with a low conductance that is constitutively open (PO∼1) and represents a distinct conformation from that of actively gated RyR1 channels involved in excitation contraction coupling (4Yang T.

It has been shown that Ry-insensitive Ca2+ leaks may contribute significantly to SR Ca2+ loading capacity and that they may have a significant contribution to regulation of [Ca2+]rest in skeletal muscle. If this is correct, then RyR1 leak may have relevance in physiological and pathological regulation of muscle Ca2+ homeostasis.Macrocyclic bastadins isolated from the marine sponge Lanthella basta are novel modulators of RyR1. Bastadin 5 (B5) has been shown to prolong dramatically both open and closed time constants of single RyR1 channels reconstituted in bilayer lipid membranes without changing their unitary conductance or overall open probability (11Mack M.M. Molinski T.F. Buck E.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23236-23249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, under conditions where RyR1 channels are pharmacologically blocked (with micromolar ryanodine or ruthenium red) both B5 and its related congener bastadin 10 have been shown to increase significantly the Ca2+ loading capacity in SR vesicles and increase the capacity of SR membranes to bind [3H]Ry ∼4-fold (Bmax) (10Pessah I.N.

As expected, expression of RyR1 in NullRyR myotubes increased [Ca2+]rest to concentrations typically found in wild type myotubes, and complete blockade of caffeine sensitive RyR1 Ca2+ release by ryanodine did not modify [Ca2+]rest levels. When B5 was added to examine the contribution of RyR1 leaks toward the [Ca2+]rest, we found that Ry+B5 in combination reduced resting [Ca2+]rest to essentially dyspedic levels in RyR1-expressing cells, but had no effect in NullRyR cells. [Ca2+]rest was further reduced when Ry+B5-pretreated NullRyR and wild type (WtRyR) myotubes were exposed to low external Ca2+ solution. Similar results were obtained in primary myotubes generated from RyR1/3-null dyspedic mice and their wild type littermates. These results show that a fraction of RyR1 within the SR membrane exists in a Ry-insensitive conformation that mediates Ca2+ leak that determines [Ca2+]rest levels in skeletal muscle. In addition, RyR1 expression also regulates basal sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx, which also contributes to [Ca2+]rest in skeletal myotubes.

In addition, RyR1 expression also regulates basal sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx, which also contributes to [Ca2+]rest in skeletal myotubes. DISCUSSIONThe purpose of this study was to examine whether the expression of RyR1 has any effect on [Ca2+]rest, the resting Ca2+ entry, and SR Ca2+ loading in skeletal muscle. Our study demonstrates that expression of WtRyR1 is associated with a significant increase in [Ca2+]rest, in resting Ca2+ entry, with no significant change in SR Ca2+ loading compared with NullRyR myotubes. The fact that we observed the same results with RyR1-transduced 1B5 myotubes and in primary myotubes rules out the possibility that the observed difference in [Ca2+]rest was related to overexpression of RyR1 when the differentiated myotubes were transduced with virion particles containing wild type RyR1 cDNA. A significant part of this elevation in [Ca2+]rest appears to be related to the presence of RyR1 leaks because Ry+B5 was able to reduce [Ca2+]rest to levels similar to those observed in NullRyR myotubes. In addition, our results show clearly that extracellular Ca2+ also plays an important role in maintaining [Ca2+]rest at physiological levels.From these results it is clear that in addition to the control of well known intracellular Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms (PMCA, NCX, SERCA) on steady-state [Ca2+]rest in skeletal muscle a significant portion of [Ca2+]rest is also set by passive Ca2+ release, which appears to be the result of a fraction of WtRyR1s within SR that are in a Ry-insensitive Ca2+ leak conformation and by the Ca2+ influx via the sarcolemma that is modulated by the presence of RyR1. In fact, the combined effect of expression of RyR1 elevated the [Ca2+]rest by ∼2-fold. The precise mechanism underlying how RyR1 leaks and the expression of the RyR1 lead to a chronic elevation [Ca2+]rest needs further study. If RyR1 leak exceeds Ca2+ uptake by the SR and extrusion by sarcolemmal mechanisms, a new dynamic equilibrium of Ca2+ mobilization must be established that allows the higher [Ca2+]rest. If the currently proposed mechanism that Ca2+extrusion processes of the plasma membrane (PMCA, SERCA, and NCX) control [Ca2+]rest they should be stimulated by elevations in resting [Ca2+]i, and in the steady state, such as those defined by our experimental conditions, these transport mechanisms should be sufficient to compensate for the increased Ca2+ leak/sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry, resulting in a return of [Ca2+]rest toward that measured in NullRyR myotubes. Because this does not happen, then the changes in [Ca2+]rest observed with the expression of RyR1 must involve a modification of the set points of the activity of both SERCA and these sarcolemmal Ca2+ transport mechanisms and/or the amount of expression of such proteins at the SR and plasma membrane. In fact, it was found that expression of RyR1 was accompanied by an increase in the expression of PMCA and a decreased expression of NCX3 and SERCA, all of them linked to the regulation of intracellular [Ca2+]. As modeled in Fig. 8, the decreased expression of SERCA, an increased expression of PMCA, elevated resting Ca2+ entry, and an elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ are the costs for expressing RyR1 and maintaining SR stores at levels equal to that found in dyspedic cells. One explanation is that RyR1-expressing cells down-regulate SERCA as a compensatory adaptation to limit the consumption of ATP that would be needed to offset RyR1-mediated Ca2+ leak from SR. If the level of SERCA expression was maintained in the face of a sizable Ca2+ leak, futile cycling of Ca2+ between the SR lumen and the extracellular space would come at a great energy cost. Conversely, dyspedic cells express higher levels of SERCA because without the RyR1 Ca2+ leak there is a reduced energy cost. One intriguing discovery in the present study is that RyR1 expression appears to confer significant regulation of the density of SERCA protein found in SR membranes. These results are consistent with previous findings that indicated up-regulation of SERCA levels in skeletal muscle membranes isolated from dyspedic mice compared with those isolated from wild type (Fig. 6 in Ref. 24Buck E.D. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7360-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Second, the higher PMCA expression could help offset decreased rates of Ca2+ transient recovery (relaxation) in light of lower SERCA capacity by removing a larger fraction of released Ca2+ during excitation to the extracellular space. Why NCX protein is down-regulated and how it contributes to maintenance of resting Ca2+ are unclear.B5, through its modulatory actions on the FKBP12·RyR1 complex, has been previously shown to increase SR Ca2+ loading capacity and concomitantly attenuate RyR1 Ca2+ leak. This property of the bastadins is the result of their ability to convert Ry-insensitive leak states (RyR1 leak) into ryanodine-sensitive channels (RyR1 Ca2+ channels) (10Pessah I.N. Molinski T.F.

We found that B5 in combination with blocking concentrations of Ry decreased [Ca2+]rest in WtRyR-expressing myotubes by 43% but had no effect in NullRyR myotubes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that bastadins can promote the conversion of RyR1 in the Ry-insensitive Ca2+ leak conformation into Ry-sensitive RyR1 channels. B5 alone, also reduced [Ca2+]rest in WtRyR1-expressing myotubes but to a lesser degree (25%) compared with its effect in combination with Ry (43%) probably because the RyR1 leaks converted into gating channels do not have the same degree of negative control by the DHPR as normal gating channels. Another interesting result is that the resting Ca2+ entry is greater in WtRyR than NullRyR myotubes, suggesting that the magnitude of this entry is modulated by the presence of RyR1. The physiological role of this resting Ca2+ entry is poorly understood, but appears to be independent of resting membrane potential (myotubes polarized based on the Nernst equation for 23 °C) and/or the degree of SR depletion as we showed in Fig. 6, as has been postulated by Kurebayashi and Ogawa (25Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), since the experiments were conducted in unstimulated myotubes. The existence of a RyR1-mediated Ca2+ leak pathway in the SR may have some implications for the pathophysiology of two well characterized disorders of skeletal muscle, malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. In muscle cells from the majority of patients with either disorder, there is a global elevation of [Ca2+]rest, which can be partially reversed by treating the muscle cells with B5 in combination with blocking concentrations of Ry (4Yang T.

In summary, our results demonstrate that that expression of WtRyR1 is associated with an increase in [Ca2+]rest and that in addition to traditionally proposed mechanisms involving SERCA, NCX, and PMCA, [Ca2+]rest in skeletal muscle is determined in part by passive Ca2+ leak through WtRyR1 and increased basal sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry.

Lloyd and Sejal Saglani examine how recent human studies are putting the focus on the epithelium as a major contributor to asthma. The findings shift the emphasis away from the T helper type 2 immune response, and call into question the utility of current animal models of the disease. Although asthma and other allergic disorders are known to have origins in infancy, some researchers are looking even earlier, to effects in utero and before conception.

https://openalex.org/W2072640994,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Notch signaling pathways have antagonistic roles during epidermal differentiation and carcinogenesis. The molecular mechanisms regulating the crosstalk between EGFR and Notch during epidermal transformation are largely unknown. We found enhanced EGFR-dependent signaling, proliferation and oncogenic transformation caused by loss of presenilins (PS), the catalytic components of γ-secretase that generates the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD). The underlying mechanism for abnormal EGFR signaling in PS-deficient cells involves γ-secretase-independent transcriptional upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Fbw7. Fbw7α, which targets NICD for degradation, regulates positively EGFR by affecting a proteasome-dependent ubiquitination step essential for constitutive degradation and stability of EGFR. To investigate the pathological relevance of this findings in vivo, we generated a novel epidermal conditional PS-deficient (ePS cDKO) mouse by deleting both PS in keratinocytes of the basal layer of the epidermis. The ePS cDKO mice develop epidermal hyperplasia associated with enhanced expression of both EGFR and Fbw7 and reduced NICD levels in keratinocytes. These findings establish a novel role for PS on epidermal growth and transformation by reciprocally regulating the EGFR and Notch signaling pathways through Fbw7."

The PKD domain observably swelled insoluble collagen. Its collagen-swelling ability and its improvement to the collagenolysis of the catalytic domain are both temperature-dependent. SEM observation showed the PKD domain swelled collagen fascicles with an increase of their diameter from 5.3 μm to 8.8 μm after 1 h of treatment, and the fibrils forming the fascicles were dispersed. AFM observation directly showed that the PKD domain bound collagen, swelled the microfibrils, and exposed the monomers. The PKD mutant W36A neither bound collagen nor disturbed its structure. Zeta potential results demonstrated that PKD treatment increased the net positive charges of the collagen surface. PKD treatment caused no change in the content or the thermostability of the collagen triple helix. Furthermore, the PKD-treated collagen could not be degraded by gelatinase. Therefore, though the triple helix monomers were exposed, the PKD domain could not unwind the collagen triple helix.

https://openalex.org/W2138077651,"Plasma sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been suggested to mainly originate from erythrocytes; however, within the erythrocyte, how sphingosine (SPH) generation--the precursor to S1P--is controlled is unknown. SPH is only generated from the hydrolysis of ceramides via ceramidases. Five human ceramidases have been identified: 1 acid, 1 neutral, and 3 alkaline ceramidases (ACER1, ACER2, and ACER3). Here, we demonstrate that only alkaline ceramidase activity is expressed in erythrocytes and that it is instrumental for SPH generation. Erythrocytes have alkaline but not acid or neutral ceramidase activity on D-e-C(18:1)-ceramide, a common substrate of ceramidases. Not only alkaline ceramidase activity but also the generation of SPH and S1P are increased during erythroid differentiation in K562 erythroleukemic cells. Such SPH and S1P increases were inhibited by the alkaline ceramidase inhibitor D-e-MAPP, suggesting that alkaline ceramidases have a role in the generation of SPH and S1P in erythroid cells. Alkaline ceramidase activity is highly expressed in mouse erythrocytes, and intravenous administration of D-e-MAPP decreased both SPH and S1P in erythrocytes and plasma. Collectively, these results suggest that alkaline ceramidase activity is important for the generation of SPH, the S1P precursor in erythrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2103080204,"Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a RhoGTPase activation protein-containing tumor suppressor that associates with various types of cancer. Although DLC2 shares a similar domain structure with that of DLC1, the function of DLC2 is not well characterized. Here, we describe the expression and ablation of DLC2 in mice using a reporter-knockout approach. DLC2 is expressed in several tissues and in endothelial cells (ECs) of blood vessels. Although ECs and blood vessels show no histological abnormalities and mice appear overall healthy, DLC2-mutant mice display enhanced angiogenic responses induced by matrigel and by tumor cells. Silencing of DLC2 in human ECs has reduced cell attachment, increased migration, and tube formation. These changes are rescued by silencing of RhoA, suggesting that the process is RhoA pathway dependent. These results indicate that DLC2 is not required for mouse development and normal vessel formation, but may protect mouse from unwanted angiogenesis induced by, for example, tumor cells."

Here, we report two chemically mutagenized mouse models carrying point mutations in Rho (Tvrm1 with an Y102H mutation and Tvrm4 with an I307N mutation). Both mutants express normal levels of rhodopsin that localize to the PR outer segments and do not exhibit PR degeneration when raised in ambient mouse room lighting; however, severe PR degeneration is observed after short exposures to bright light. Both mutations also cause a delay in recovery following bleaching. This defect might be due to a slower rate of chromophore binding by the mutant opsins compared with the WT form, and an increased rate of transducin activation by the unbound mutant opsins, which leads to a constitutive activation of the phototransduction cascade as revealed by in vitro biochemical assays. The mutant-free opsins produced by the respective mutant Rho genes appear to be more toxic to PRs, as Tvrm1 and Tvrm4 mutants lacking the 11-cis chromophore degenerate faster than mice expressing WT opsin that also lack the chromophore.

https://openalex.org/W1985046171,"15-Deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), a representative cyclopentenone prostaglandin, has many interesting biological effects. In this study, treatment of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) with 15d-PGJ(2) led to accumulation of p53 protein. However, the p53 DNA binding and its transcriptional activity were significantly reduced. 15d-PGJ(2) directly modified p53 as verified by reacting recombinant p53 with biotinylated 15d-PGJ(2). 9,10-Dihydro-15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) lacking the electrophilic alpha,beta-unsaturated functionality failed to inhibit p53 DNA binding as well as to modify p53. Moreover, by conducting an in vitro [(35)S]-labeled p53 translation assay, we identified cysteine 277 as a putative site of p53 modification by 15d-PGJ(2). The DNA-binding ability of a mutant p53 in which cysteine 277 was substituted by alanine was virtually unaffected by 15d-PGJ(2). Likewise, p53 binding activity of biotinylated 15d-PGJ(2) was abolished in mutant cells. In addition, cells expressing wild-type p53 exhibited p53 protein stability to a greater extent than mutant C277A cells. In conclusion, 15d-PGJ(2) can undergo nucleophilic addition to p53, presumably at the cysteine 277 residue, rendering this tumor suppressor less susceptible to proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1994554141,"Correct hematopoietic differentiation requires the tightly regulated execution of lineage-specific and stage-restricted gene expression programs. This process is disturbed in hematological malignancies that typically show incomplete differentiation but often also display a mixed lineage phenotype. Co-expression of lymphoid and myeloid molecules is a well-known feature of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) with t(8;21). These cells consistently express the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5, and the B-cell-specific cell surface protein CD19. However, the functional consequences of PAX5 expression are unknown. To address this question, we studied the chromatin features of CD19, which is a direct target of PAX5 in cells with and without the t(8;21) chromosomal translocation. We show that CD19 chromatin exists in a poised configuration in myeloid progenitors and that this poised chromatin structure facilitates PAX5-dependent CD19 activation. Our results also show a positive correlation between PAX5 and CD19 expression in t(8;21)-positive AML cells and demonstrate that PAX5 binds to the promoter and enhancer of CD19 gene and remodels chromatin structure at the promoter. This study shows that expression of PAX5 in leukemic cells has functional consequences and points to an important role of a progenitor-specific chromatin configuration in myeloid leukemia."

Recombinant CX3 and BCDX2 complexes were purified from Sf21 cells grown in spinner flasks in Grace's Insect Media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). For CX3, 300 ml Sf21 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were inoculated with viruses for his-Rad51C (moi, 5) and his-XRCC3 (moi, 5). After 48 h of incubation at 27 °C, the cells were pelleted at 2000 rpm at 4 °C and washed once with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was frozen and kept at −80 °C. For BCDX2, 1 liter of Sf21 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) was co-infected with his-Rad51B (moi, 5), his-Rad51C (moi, 5), his-Rad51D (moi, 10), and his-XRCC2 (moi, 10) viruses. Both Rad51 paralog complexes were purified by similar procedures. Briefly, the cells were lysed in buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 400 mm NaCl, 8 mm BME, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min on ice, and the lysate was dounce homogenized and incubated for 10 min more on ice. The lysate was clarified by spinning at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The proteins were batch purified with 1 ml of Nickel resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with buffer A, added to the clarified extract and rocked gently at 4 °C. After 1 h, the resin was washed 5 times with 15 ml of buffer A containing 30 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) and 5% glycerol. The bound proteins were eluted from the resin with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole and 10% glycerol. An AKTA FPLC system equipped with a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) was used to further purify the Rad51 paralog complexes. The column was equilibrated with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 400 mm NaCl, 8 mm BME, and 20% glycerol. Affinity-purified BCDX2 or CX3 complexes were injected, and the column was run at a rate of 0.4 ml/min at 4 °C, and 200-μl fractions were collected. The column was first calibrated using the high molecular mass calibration kit from Amersham Biosciences. The retention volumes of aldolase (158 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) were determined and fit to the curve y = −0.1732x + 4.37 (R2 = 0.961). BCDX2 and CX3 were eluted in single peaks from the columns, and their purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized using Coomassie Blue stain (Fig. 1). The complexes were determined to be free from contaminating nucleases and all subunits were present in each complex. In agreement with previous studies the apparent stoichiometry of BCDX2 was 1:1:1:1 and CX3 was 1:1 (Fig. 1) (20Masson J.Y. Tarsounas M.C. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Shah R. McIlwraith M.J. Benson F.E. West S.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3296-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The proteins were stored at −80 °C. The Holliday junction (HJ575) and replication fork (RF25) DNA templates for EM were synthesized as previously described (26Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). For replication forks containing different sized ssDNA gaps at the base of the junction, the pGLGAP plasmid was nicked with N.BbvCIA (NEB) and a 400-nt ssDNA arm was displaced using Klenow fragment (exo-) as previously described (28Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42568-42572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To vary the amount of ssDNA at the junction of the fork we used the following primers; primer 1nt (5′-CCTCACTCTCCTCCCCTCCA-3′); primer 5nt (5′-ACTCTCTTCCCCTCCATACC-3′); primer 15nt (5′-CCTCCATACCCTTCCTCCAT-3′); and primer 25nt (5′-CTTCCTCCATCTATACCACC-3′) to convert the ss displaced arm to dsDNA. Binding reactions were carried out with CX3 at a molar ratio of 1:5 (DNA to CX3 protein heterodimer) or BCDX2 at a molar ratio of 1:3 (DNA to BCDX2 protein heterotetramer) in 30 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 8.0 (KOH), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 60 mm phosphocreatine, and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) for 10 min at 30 °C. Samples were fixed in 0.6% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and passed over a 2-ml column of 2% agarose beads (Agarose Bead Technology, Colna, Portugal) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and 0.1 mm EDTA. DNA-rich fractions were mixed with buffer containing 2 mm spermidine and 150 mm NaCl and incubated on glow charged carbon foil grids for 3 min. Carbon grids were washed in water and dehydrated in a series of ethanol washes, air-dried, and rotary shadowcast with tungsten. Samples were visualized on a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope at 40 kV. All microscopy images were captured using a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera and supporting software (Gatan Inc. Pleasanton CA). Purified BCDX2 (216 μg/ml) or CX3 (65 μg/ml) complexes were diluted 1:1 (to a final volume of 30 μl) into a buffer of 40% glycerol, 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.5) followed by gentle centrifugation through Sephadex G-50 equilibrated in this buffer. The proteins were sprayed into tiny droplets directly onto very thin, glow discharge-treated carbon foils supported by 400-mesh copper grids using an EFFA atomizer (Earnest Fullam Inc). The samples were placed in an oil-free cryo-pumped evaporator and dried for 18 h at a final vacuum of 1 × 108 torr. Without breaking the vacuum, the sample was rotary shadowcast with a thin layer of tungsten and examined in a Tecnai 12 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 16 kV. Purified complexes were adsorbed directly onto glow-charged carbon covered copper mesh grids for 3–5 min followed by staining with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate in water. Samples were analyzed in a Tecnai 12 EM at 80 kV. Human Rad51 paralog complexes BCDX2 and CX3 were co-expressed in insect cells, purified, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1, A and B). Binding of BCDX2 and CX3 to DNA templates containing a replication fork or Holliday junction structure was examined by EM. The replication fork and Holliday junction templates have been described previously (26Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 28Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42568-42572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The replication fork template has a 400-bp fork created within a 3.4-kb duplex circle and the Holliday junction contains four 575-bp intersecting arms. BCDX2 or CX3 were incubated with the DNA, fixed, and adsorbed onto carbon grids and then shadowcast with tungsten (Fig. 2). Binding was deliberately kept at subsaturating levels of protein:DNA as incubations at higher ratios resulted in the formation of large protein-DNA aggregates (data not shown) similar to those previously observed by EM (20Masson J.Y. Tarsounas M.C. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Shah R. McIlwraith M.J. Benson F.E. West S.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3296-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the percentage of replication fork (RF) DNAs with CX3 bound were 60 ± 5% (n = 210, three independent experiments) and 30 ± 5% for BCDX2 (n = 162, two independent experiments). Examination of the binding preferences of these CX3 complexes on RF DNAs (n = 210) revealed that 75 ± 4% were localized exclusively at the forked junction (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3B). The remaining CX3 bound molecules were bound at sites other than the three-way junction, for example along the tail or along the circular portion of the DNA template (25 ± 4%). Similarly, BCDX2 revealed a high specificity for the fork junction. Of the 162 RF DNA molecules scored, 74 ± 10% showed the BCDX2 complex localized to the fork, with the remaining complexes bound at other sites on the DNA (26 ± 10%) (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3B). We next examined binding of CX3 and BCDX2 to Holliday junctions (HJ) by EM under conditions in which 75 ± 5% of the HJ DNAs were bound by CX3 and 57 ± 10% were bound by BCDX2 (Fig. 3C and 5). Of the 182 CX3 molecules bound to HJ DNA, 89 ± 0.5% was localized to the junction. Similarly, 86 ± 19% (n = 258) of the bound BCDX2 complexes were localized to the junction (Fig. 3D). The remaining molecules were bound nonspecifically on the HJ DNA template either at the end of one arm, or rarely along the arm itself. Given the large number of possible binding sites for BCDX2 or CX3 on Holliday junctions and replication forks these findings suggest a strong preference for binding to the junctions relative to the much longer regions of DNA along the arms, or at the ends of the dsDNA. It is possible that Rad51 paralog complexes bind directly to DNA junctions using a bind and release mechanism; or alternatively, they may bind to duplex DNA and slide until they reach a junction where they become stably arrested. To examine this possibility, we incubated replication forks with the Rad51 paralog complexes and removed samples at various time points for analysis by EM. We monitored the location of complex binding (i.e. duplex or junction) as a function of time. The number of BCDX2-bound DNAs remained constant over the 60 min (Table 1). Analysis of the location of BCDX2 revealed that 73% were bound specifically at the junction at 2 min (Table 1). This number increased to 84% at 60 min.TABLE 1Time course of BCDX2 and CX3 complexes binding to DNAs containing junctionsProtein complexTime (min)Overall % bound molecules% Bound to junction DNA% Bound to duplex DNAn =BCDX225273271061030742616260488416103CX3246937101106075252106022919102 Open table in a new tab The percentage of molecules bound by CX3 reached a peak at 10 min with 60% of molecules bound (n = 101) (Table 1). Like, BCDX2, 93% of those molecules bound by CX3 were bound at the junction at 2 min (Table 1). The absence of duplex DNA binding at early time points suggests that complexes must slide very quickly along the duplex DNA, or that they do not need to bind duplex DNA to find junctions. Rad51 paralogs bind efficiently to ssDNA, but not dsDNA (19Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K. Kagawa W. Takata M. Takeda S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5538-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Masson J.Y. Tarsounas M.C. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Shah R. McIlwraith M.J. Benson F.E. West S.C.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8440-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The replication fork templates used in Fig. 2 contain 25 nt of ssDNA at the base of the replication fork junction (28Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42568-42572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that ssDNA may be responsible at least in part, for localizing the Rad51 paralogs to the replication fork structures. In an effort to determine the extent that ssDNA contributes to protein binding on these templates, we examined the binding of BCDX2 and CX3 to replication fork templates containing different sized ssDNA gaps at the base of the replication fork junction. To create these DNA templates, plasmids containing a N.BbvCIA nicking site at the 5′-end of a 400-bp G-less cassette were nicked and strand displacement reactions were carried out using the Klenow fragment (exo-) in the absence of dCTP. Strand displacement is therefore stopped at the end of the G-less cassette when it encounters the first guanine. Primers were designed that anneal to the base of the displaced arm leaving a 1-, 5-, 15-, or 25-nt ssDNA gap. The arms were converted to dsDNA by primer extension using Klenow fragment (exo-) thus generating a 400-bp arm on a 3.4-kb duplex circle (see Ref. 28Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42568-42572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”). Scoring greater than 200 molecules per replication fork template we observed little evidence that ssDNA contributed significantly to the binding of these junctions. The percentage of junction bound molecules was consistent regardless of the length of ssDNA at the base of the fork. Overall 42 ± 20% of the DNA was bound by BCDX2 for replications forks containing a 1nt gap, compared with templates containing longer ssDNA gaps of 5, 15, or 25 nt that had 23 ± 8%, 30 ± 10%, and 24 ± 13% of the replications forks bound by BCDX2 respectively (Fig. 4A). The same was true for CX3 complexes. Overall 34 ± 9% of the DNA was bound by CX3 for replications forks containing a 1-nt gap. In comparison templates containing longer gaps of 5, 15, or 25 nt had 38 ± 21%, 32 ± 6%, and 59 ± 25% of the replication forks bound by CX3, respectively (Fig. 4B). BCDX2 continued to bind exclusively to the junction of the replication forks with 87 ± 1% (n = 267) of junctions bound at this site for replications forks containing a 1-nt gap and 96 ± 6% (n = 233) and 85 ± 3% (n = 266) for replications forks with longer gaps of 5nt and 15 nt gaps, respectively (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained for CX3. Binding of CX3 to replication forks with a 1-nt gap resulted in 85 ± 16% (n = 211) of replication forks bound exclusively at the junction. Replication forks containing longer gaps of 5 nt and 15 nt had 95 ± 6%, (n = 217) and 79 ± 12%, (n = 228) of CX3 protein bound specifically at the junction (Fig. 4D). Therefore, we conclude that the small amount of ssDNA present at the base of the replication fork junctions does not contribute significantly to the recognition or specific binding of Rad51 paralog complexes to forked junctions. Closer examination of the tungsten-shadowed BCDX2 and CX3 protein complexes bound to DNA templates suggested that they formed a large multimeric protein complex with reasonably uniform size and shape (Figs. 2 and 5). In an effort to explore the structure of these complexes in more detail we used a combination of techniques including negative staining EM, and a technique we described previously as glycerol spray/low voltage EM (30Griffith J.D. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15233-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This latter EM preparative method is an adaptation of that described independently by Erickson and Branton (31Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Shotton D.M. Burke B.E. Branton D. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 303-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). It has the advantage of controlled drying and not exposing proteins to chemical fixatives, air-drying, or strong metal salts. These techniques allow us to obtain better resolution of structures formed by the protein complexes. Using these approaches we were able to visualize fields of uniform CX3 complexes (Fig. 6D and supplemental Fig. S1). Measurements of CX3 dimensions by tungsten-shadowing, glycerol spray, and negative staining EM suggest that the rings have a diameter ∼16 nm (Table 2). The observation that almost all of the CX3 molecules observed by glycerol spray and negative staining techniques lay in a single orientation is consistent with a flat protein structure that is too narrow to lay on the EM support on its edge (Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. S1). As such side profiles of the protein complex were not often visible by the techniques used in this study. Furthermore, we were able to visualize a central pore in the CX3 complex by negative staining EM.TABLE 2Summary of measurements from BCDX2 and CX3 protein complexes using three EM preparative methodsProtein complexEM methodDiameter ± S.D.n =nmBCDX2Glycerol spray21 ± 4118BCDX2Negative staining28 ± 751BCDX2Tungsten shadowing28 ± 922CX3Glycerol spray16 ± 3106CX3Negative staining21 ± 717CX3Tungsten shadowing19 ± 451 Open table in a new tab Fields of uniform BCDX2 complexes were also observed by negative staining and glycerol spray EM (Fig. 6 and data not shown). In this case the rings were larger than that observed for CX3 complexes (Table 2). Again, most molecules were observed in a single orientation indicating that the molecules are flat and unable to lie on the supports in different orientations. Comparisons of the size of over a hundred BCDX2 complexes suggested that they had a diameter of ∼21 nm (Table 2). We occasionally observed smaller ring-shaped protein complexes in the background of negatively stained BCDX2 samples (Fig. 6, C and E). These contained a central pore and had a diameter more similar to that observed with CX3 complexes. Thus it is possible that the larger BCDX2 complex dissociates into smaller subcomplexes during preparation of the BCDX2 complex for negative staining EM, or alternatively that there is a small percentage of heterodimers or monomers in the preparation. To examine this possibility we used size exclusion chromatography to isolate the whole complex from possible subcomplexes or monomers prior to preparation for EM. The BCDX2 complex eluted as a single peak near the void volume of the column (Fig. 6A). This fraction was mounted for EM and revealed ring-shaped complexes identical to those observed in previous preparations (Fig. 6B). A second peak with a mass of ∼160 kDa contained only two of the four Rad51 paralogs from the BCDX2 complex. This suggests that the BCDX2 preparation contained a low level of BCDX2 subcomplexes that may account for the occasional smaller ring structures. In addition this confirms that the ring structures observed by EM contain the entire BCDX2 complex. Interestingly, the elution of the complexes near the void volume is indicative of either a very large protein complex or a complex with an asymmetrical structure (see “Discussion”). The latter is consistent with our EM data in which the complexes are observed in a single orientation consistent with a flat ring-shaped particle rather than a globular protein. In this study we used EM to demonstrate that Rad51B-Rad51C-Rad51D-Xrcc2 (BCDX2) and Rad51C-Xrcc3 (CX3) complexes bind strongly to Holliday junction and replication fork structures. Furthermore, BCDX2 and CX3 were seen to bind to the junction of replication forks and the intersection of the four duplex arms of the Holliday junction with exceptionally high specificity for the junctions relative to the much longer regions of duplex DNA or DNA ends. This work also provides the first visualization of BCDX2 and CX3 structures free in solution and bound to DNA and suggests that both BCDX2 and CX3 form flat ring-shaped complexes. Previous attempts by others to visualize CX3 protein complexes by EM were problematic revealing only dispersed and irregular structures with occasional ring like structures in the background (25Masson J.Y. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Benson F.E. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8440-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus the structure of the CX3 complex could not be determined. Using the glycerol spray/low voltage and negative staining EM we were successful at visualizing fields of uniform CX3 complexes, which revealed a flattened ring-shape structure. Size analysis revealed that the CX3 complex has a diameter of ∼16 nm. This is consistent with that of a higher oligomer of CX3 protein rather than protein monomers or heterodimers. This work also provides the first EM visualization of the BCDX2 complex as a flat ring-shaped structure. Its size is larger than that of CX3 with a diameter of ∼21 nm. The occasional observation of smaller rings in the background of BCDX2 complexes by negative staining leads us to consider the model in which the BCDX2 complex may be composed of smaller rings that are sometimes dissociated during EM preparation. Consistent with this idea, ring structures have been reported previously for Xrcc2-Rad51D subcomplex (33Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Enomoto R. Kagawa W. Kinebuchi T. Yamazoe M. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14315-14320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The size and shape of Xrcc2-Rad51D rings were consistent with the size of rings observed in the background of negatively stained BCDX2 complexes (33Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Enomoto R. Kagawa W. Kinebuchi T. Yamazoe M. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14315-14320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports CX3 and BCDX2 complexes eluted from size exclusion chromatography in a 1:1 (CX3) or 1:1:1:1 (BCDX2) ratio (19Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K. Kagawa W. Takata M. Takeda S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5538-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Masson J.Y. Tarsounas M.C. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Shah R. McIlwraith M.J. Benson F.E. West S.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3296-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 25Masson J.Y. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Benson F.E. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8440-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This suggests that each ring complex contains an equal number of each paralog. In addition, the observation that most CX3 and BCDX2 complexes are observed in a single orientation on the EM support in both glycerol spray and negative staining EM preparations suggest that the complexes are flat rings with narrow side to small to support themselves. This latter finding may explain why Rad51 paralog complexes elute near the void volume of SEC columns. Mass analysis using gel filtration is based on the assumption that the protein complex is globular. Therefore, it is not unexpected that the complexes eluted in fractions consistent with a larger mass. Indeed, a complex that is not globular may have a significantly altered elution and such structures are often eluted in the void volume. The visualization of affinity purified complexes before and after the SEC strongly suggests that the predominant structure formed by the CX3 and BCDX2 complexes are flat ring-shaped structures. However, it remains possible that other structural states of the complexes may exist within the population. However, we did not identify any such molecules after analyzing fields of BCDX2 or CX3 complexes by EM. Previous studies have demonstrated that both BCDX2 and CX3 bind preferentially to ssDNA consistent with their role in the early stages of HRR (20Masson J.Y. Tarsounas M.C. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Shah R. McIlwraith M.J. Benson F.E. West S.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3296-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 25Masson J.Y. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Benson F.E. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8440-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, Rad51B and the BCDX2 complex have been shown to bind to branched structures including Y-shaped molecules and Holliday junctions as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (20Masson J.Y. Tarsounas M.C. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Shah R. McIlwraith M.J. Benson F.E. West S.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3296-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 23Yokoyama H. Sarai N. Kagawa W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2767-2772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Visualization of binding to Holliday junctions and forked DNA structures by EM however, has up until now, been lacking. The EM images in this report provide the first visualization of BCDX2 and CX3 complexes binding to Holliday junctions and replication forks. They reveal that BCDX2 and CX3 bind predominantly to structured components of DNA substrates, rather than being localized at duplex regions or at free ends. The Holliday junction structures contain four intersecting 575-bp DNA duplexes, and the replication fork is created within a 3.4-kb circular duplex DNA. Therefore, there are large numbers of potential binding sites available for binding. But neither complex bound to the duplex DNA regions of these templates. We did, however, observe a high binding specificity for the junction of the replication fork and the intersection of the four duplex DNA arms in the Holliday junctions. It remains possible that the complexes recognize ssDNA at the junction of the replication fork or through transient breathing of the Holliday junction structure. However, decreasing the ssDNA regions at the base of the replication forks to as little as 1nt had little impact in the overall binding or the specificity of the complexes for the junctions of the DNAs. To test this further we incubated the templates with a competitor DNA containing ssDNA at one end and still observed preferential binding of CX3 and BCDX2 to the junction structures (data not shown). Therefore we conclude that ssDNA does not contribute significantly to the recognition or specific binding of these complexes to replication fork structures. There are several possible mechanisms for recognizing junction structures including scanning the DNA and binding tightly to junctions when they are encountered. Or alternatively, a bind and release mechanism where complexes bind directly to the junction without preloading or scanning duplex DNA. In the first model, scanning could be slow or fast. In the case of slow scanning, a large number of duplex bound DNAs would be anticipated at early time points that eventually transition to junction bound DNAs as the complexes encounter junction structures. We did not observe this by EM. This suggests that CX3 and BCDX2 may scan the duplex DNA quickly and bind to junctions rapidly or may use a bind and release mechanism to load directly onto the junctions without the need to scan duplex DNA. Examination of the DNA-bound complexes revealed flat ring-shaped molecules similar to free protein. Indeed, one can visualize the different orientations of the flat disc in its bound state in some EM images (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). It is unclear what the manner of DNA binding is for the BCDX2 or CX3 complexes. It is possible that the DNA threads through the pore of the complexes. This has been observed for other ring-shaped proteins for example the SV40 large T antigen, the T7 gp4, and E. coli DNA B (35Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Müller S. Engel A. Van Dyck E. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Alternatively the DNA could wrap around the outside of the ring. Clearly further EM analysis of these complexes is required to clarify how these complexes interact with DNA. Such information would clearly facilitate models of how these complexes facilitate DNA repair and replication. The finding that both BCDX2 and CX3 bind to Holliday junctions and replication forks is consistent with their role in the latter stages of HRR (21Liu Y. Masson J.Y. Shah R. O'Regan P. West S.C. Science. 2004; 303: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Given that both early and late acting roles have been proposed for Rad51 paralogs, it is possible that different subcomplexes have different functional roles. Alternatively, association with other proteins may regulate the function of the Rad51 paralog complexes. For example in vivo interactions with other proteins could influence the equilibrium of different subcomplexes and/or modulate the behavior of these complexes. Possible candidates for interacting partners include the GEN1 resolvase and BLM helicase, both of which have been associated with Rad51 paralogs (21Liu Y. Masson J.Y. Shah R. O'Regan P. West S.C. Science. 2004; 303: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 22Braybrooke J.P. Li J.L. Wu L. Caple F. Benson F.E. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48357-48366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea the Rad51D-Xrcc2 subcomplex has been shown to stimulate the activity of BLM helicase on Holliday junction templates (22Braybrooke J.P. Li J.L. Wu L. Caple F. Benson F.E. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48357-48366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine the binding preferences for each of the Rad51 paralog complexes and establish if associations with interacting proteins modulate their binding preferences or function.

https://openalex.org/W2089751376,"Salivary glands are innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons, which release neurotransmitters that promote fluid secretion and exocytosis when they bind to muscarinic and β-adrenergic receptors, respectively. Signaling pathways downstream of these receptors are mainly distinct, but there is cross-talk that affects receptor-dependent events. Here we report that the β-adrenergic ligand isoproterenol blocks increases in extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, a protein kinase C-dependent event promoted by the muscarinic receptor ligand carbachol in freshly dispersed rat parotid acinar cells. The inhibitory action of isoproterenol was reproduced by cAMP stimuli (forskolin) and mimetics (dibutyryl-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP), including one highly selective for protein kinase A (N6-benzoyl-cAMP). In contrast, Epac (exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP)-selective activators did not mimic the blockade of ERK by isoproterenol, suggesting that inhibition involved protein kinase A. Isoproterenol also blocked ERK downstream of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the P2X7 and epidermal growth factor receptors. Isoproterenol and forskolin blocked MEK phosphorylation, reduced RAF phosphorylation on a stimulatory site (Ser-338), and increased RAF phosphorylation on an inhibitory site (Ser-259). Inhibitory effects on ERK were also observed in freshly dispersed rat submandibular acinar cells but not in three immortalized/cancer salivary cell lines (Par-C10, HSY, HSG), indicating significant differences between native cells and cell lines. Notably, in native parotid cells isoproterenol enhanced the carbachol-promoted increases in [Ca2+]i and oxygen consumption, events that initiate and accompany, respectively, the stimulation of fluid secretion by muscarinic ligands. Thus, isoproterenol produces opposite effects on prominent events downstream of the muscarinic receptor second messengers diacylglycerol (decrease in ERK phosphorylation) and inositol trisphosphate (increase in [Ca2+]i and fluid secretion).

IntroductionAlmost all mammalian cells have multiple types of heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors. The muscarinic receptor and β-adrenergic receptor are G-protein-coupled receptors that affect the physiological activities of many cells, and neurotransmitters binding to these receptors produce well defined and mainly separate functional effects in salivary glands, which are innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons (1Proctor G.B. Carpenter G.H. Auton. Neurosci. 2007; 133: 3-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Parotid acinar cells express M3 muscarinic receptors (2Dai Y.S. Ambudkar I.S. Horn V.J. Yeh C.K. Kousvelari E.E. Wall S.J. Li M. Yasuda R.P. Wolfe B.B. Baum B.J. Am. J.

The increase in intracellular Ca2+ initiates the opening of ion channels, electrolyte and fluid secretion, and subsequently, the formation of saliva in the oral cavity (3Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation of parotid β-adrenergic receptors promotes exocytosis and the release of amylase protein into the oral cavity. β-Adrenergic receptors are coupled via Gs to adenylyl cyclase, and receptor stimulation generates the production of cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A (PKA)) and a signaling cascade downstream of PKA. Muscarinic receptors also can promote exocytosis, but this is more limited than that due to β-adrenergic signaling (4Yoshimura K. Murakami M. Segawa A. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In many cells cAMP also can activate exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac), which are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the GTPase Rap. Epac is a cAMP-dependent PKA-independent protein that can mediate various signaling and functional events in salivary glands and other cells (5Chaudhuri A. Husain S.Z. Kolodecik T.R. Grant W.M.

This can produce complications in evaluating the mechanisms of cross-talk that exist when there is combined muscarinic and β-adrenergic signaling, which is a focus of the present study.Isoproterenol has other effects on parotid acinar cells in addition to promoting exocytosis of secretory granules. It has been recognized for more than 40 years that the chronic systemic administration of the β-adrenergic ligand isoproterenol to rodents promotes enlargement of parotid salivary glands (8Schneyer C. Am. J. Physiol. 1962; 203: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Schneyer C.A. Humphreys-Beher M. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 256: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This is accompanied by increases in DNA synthesis and involves both hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Parotid glands from mice treated with isoproterenol for times up to 24 h display significant changes in the expression patterns of >40 genes, including cell cycle proteins, transcriptional factors, and kinases (10Ten Hagen K. Balys M.M. Tabak L.A. Melvin J.E. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 28: 107-114Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Treatment of rat parotid glands with isoproterenol (1–4 h) increased the tight junction permeability (11Mazariegos M.R. Hand A.R. J. Dent. Res. 1984; 63: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and acute exposure of dispersed rat parotid acini to isoproterenol enhanced the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter activity (12Paulais M. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21558-21563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although muscarinic and β-adrenergic receptors promote chiefly parallel signaling pathways and physiological events in salivary gland cells, there is both positive and negative cross-talk between these two important receptor-mediated signaling pathways. In primary cultures of mouse parotid acinar cells, carbachol and isoproterenol both increased the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (13Yamada K. Inoue H. Kida S. Masushige S. Nishiyama T. Mishima K. Saito I. Pathobiology. 2006; 73: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Isoproterenol and the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin increased the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by the muscarinic and α-adrenergic receptor stimulation in rodent parotid acinar cells, and this was due to the phosphorylation of the InsP3 receptor in a PKA-dependent manner (14Bruce J.I.

This offers an explanation for the stimulatory effect of cAMP production/PKA activation on fluid secretion in parotid and submandibular glands (17Larsson O. Olgart L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1989; 137: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Bobyock E. Chernick W.S. J. Dent. Res. 1989; 68: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and other epithelial glands (19Martin S.C. Thompson J. Shuttleworth T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C255-C265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, cross-talk between these receptors can go in both directions, as M3 muscarinic receptor stimulation can desensitize β2-adrenergic receptors via a PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor (20Budd D.C. Challiss R.A. Young K.W. Tobin A.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 813-823PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, M3 receptor stimulation by carbachol promotes a reduction in the isoproterenol-promoted production of cAMP in rodent parotid and submandibular cells (2Dai Y.S. Ambudkar I.S. Horn V.J. Yeh C.K. Kousvelari E.E. Wall S.J. Li M. Yasuda R.P. Wolfe B.B. Baum B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1063-C1073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Watson E.L. Jacobson K.L. DiJulio D.H. Dowd F.J. Am.

Pathol. 2003; 163: 957-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and plays a vital role in promoting the branching morphogenesis of developing salivary glands (26Kashimata M. Sayeed S. Ka A. Onetti-Muda A. Sakagami H. Faraggiana T. Gresik E.W. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that isoproterenol had a substantial negative effect on the carbachol-initiated phosphorylation of ERK in dispersed rat parotid acinar cells. Because cAMP can exert either positive or negative effects on ERK signaling in many cells (27Gerits N. Kostenko S. Shiryaev A. Johannessen M. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1592-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we examined the cross-talk between β-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors in more detail in several native salivary gland acinar cells and cell lines. We compared the effects of forskolin, cAMP analogs, and Epac-specific activators to the effects of isoproterenol on the stimulation of ERK phosphorylation by carbachol. We also examined the effects of isoproterenol on multiple physiological indices of fluid secretion as well as on ERK phosphorylation downstream of P2X7 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, neither of which is coupled to G-proteins. The results indicate that isoproterenol produces both positive and negative effects on muscarinic signaling within the same cell and can block ERK activation downstream of multiple types of receptors.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates a new aspect of receptor cross-talk in salivary gland acinar cells; cAMP production and signaling proteins downstream of the β-adrenergic receptor exert a significant negative effect on the activation of ERK by M3 muscarinic receptor stimulation. This effect is in contrast to various studies that demonstrated that cAMP/PKA enhances [Ca2+]i elevation and fluid secretion, which are important physiological events downstream of the muscarinic receptor in salivary glands. Acetylcholine, the natural ligand, or carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, bind to the M3 muscarinic receptor in salivary gland acinar cells and promote the production of InsP3 and diacylglycerol, second messengers that affect multiple cellular responses. InsP3 binds to InsP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, causing the release of stored Ca2+, followed by the entry of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane via proteins contributing to store-operated Ca2+ entry (41Cahalan M.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This increases [Ca2+]i, which opens Ca2+-sensitive ion channels and commences the ion movements that result in net fluid and electrolyte secretion to initiate salivation (3Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The production of diacylglycerol increases the activity of PKC proteins, and these mediate increases in ERK phosphorylation and activity in parotid acinar cells (30Benes C. Soltoff S.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1498-C1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Bradford M.D. Soltoff S.P. Eur. J. Morphol. 1998; 36: 176-180PubMed Google Scholar) and many other cells. Notably, the two contrasting actions of isoproterenol (that is, the reduction of the M3R-promoted ERK phosphorylation and the enhancement of the M3R-initiated increase in [Ca2+]i) demonstrate that cAMP has opposite effects on effectors downstream of the two second messengers (diacylglycerol, InsP3) that are produced from M3R-initiated PIP2 hydrolysis. These contrasting effects also indicate that the negative effect of isoproterenol on ERK is not initiated at the level of the M3 receptor in parotid cells, although cAMP can down-regulate some muscarinic receptor subtypes (43Lee K.M. Toscas K. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9945-9948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of interest to our results, recent studies indicate that the signaling downstream of the M3 muscarinic receptor can be complex. Multiple arrestins, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase proteins, and casein kinase 1α can regulate muscarinic receptor-mediated increases in intracellular Ca2+ and ERK phosphorylation in a differential manner (44Luo J. Busillo J.M. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The knockdown of these proteins indicated that some regulators, including GRK2, exerted a negative regulation of both ERK and intracellular Ca2+, whereas others were selective for Ca2+.In addition to blocking ERK and MEK, forskolin and isoproterenol altered RAF phosphorylation in inverse fashion on two known regulatory sites. These cAMP-elevating agents produced a reduction in the carbachol-promoted increase in phosphorylation of RAF on Ser-338, a site within its catalytic domain and one that is required to be phosphorylated for its activation (37Dumaz N. Marais R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3491-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RAF on Ser-338 is increased by the stimulation of other G protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors (35Dougherty M.K. Müller J. Ritt D.A. Zhou M. Zhou X.Z. Copeland T.D. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Lu K.P. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 215-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 45Beeram M. Patnaik A. Rowinsky E.K. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 6771-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and previously we reported that carbachol increases the phosphorylation of this site in parotid acinar cells (31Soltoff S.P. Hedden L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C590-C599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, isoproterenol and forskolin increased the phosphorylation of RAF on Ser-259, a negative regulatory site. cAMP promotes PKA-mediated increases in both Ser-259 and Ser-223 phosphorylation, which stimulates the binding of 14-3-3 and keeps RAF in an inactive state by preventing its recruitment to the plasma membrane (46Dumaz N. Marais R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29819-29823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). When PMA was employed as a stimulus to increase ERK phosphorylation in parotid acinar cells, isoproterenol and forskolin also had inhibitory effects on ERK, MEK, and RAF-Ser-338 phosphorylation, although the relative inhibition was somewhat less than that when carbachol was the stimulus. The inhibitory actions of isoproterenol and other cAMP-elevating stimuli on ERK phosphorylation in carbachol-treated cells may be due to a combination of the increase in Ser-259-RAF phosphorylation and the block of the phosphorylation of Ser-338-RAF. However, a possibility remains that the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation is at least partly independent of RAF, as PKC can activate ERK directly via MEK rather than RAF in some cells (47Wen-Sheng W. Cancer Lett. 2006; 239: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ERK phosphorylation by carbachol is nearly completely blocked by inhibition of PKC in parotid cells (23Bradford M.D. Soltoff S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 745-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that PKC is a major upstream regulator of ERK phosphorylation.Isoproterenol blocked the phosphorylation of ERK downstream of three very different types of receptors, indicating the broad effectiveness of cAMP as an inhibitor of ERK signaling. The P2X7 receptor is a non-selective ion channel that activates some of the same signaling pathways as the G-protein-coupled muscarinic receptor in parotid acinar cells (23Bradford M.D. Soltoff S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 745-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the EGF receptor is a tyrosine kinase. The actions of isoproterenol on these three different kinds of receptors suggest that the site of inhibition is located at a common part of the ERK signaling cascade that is activated by all three stimuli; most likely, RAF.PKA can have either positive or negative effects on ERK activity, and it can have affects on multiple proteins that are upstream of ERK signaling (for review, see Ref. 27Gerits N. Kostenko S. Shiryaev A. Johannessen M. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1592-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). cAMP and PKA can have diverse affects on the ERK signaling cascades, and this varies with cell type; therefore, the actions of PKA on ERK signaling are controversial. Forskolin can increase and potentiate the stimulation of various agents on ERK phosphorylation (48Benes C. Roisin M.P. Van Tan H. Creuzet C. Miyazaki J. Fagard R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15507-15513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), effects that are very different from that on rat parotid acinar cells. In native rat parotid cells, the effects of isoproterenol and forskolin on RAF were consistent, and we did not examine the effects of cAMP-producing stimuli upstream of RAF. Although Epac is involved in many biological and signaling processes, including those in parotid acinar cells, the Epac-selective cAMP analogs were ineffective in reproducing the inhibitory effects of multiple cAMP mimetics and other stimuli on ERK phosphorylation by carbachol (Fig. 5). These compounds are specific for the guanine nuclear exchange factors Epac1 and Epac2 because their structures are highly selective for the cAMP binding domain of Epac compared with the cAMP binding domain of PKA (6Holz G.G. Kang G. Harbeck M. Roe M.W. Chepurny O.G. J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 49Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Epac may promote the activation of ERK in some cells (27Gerits N. Kostenko S. Shiryaev A. Johannessen M. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1592-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but the treatment of rat parotid acinar cells to the Epac analogs alone did not increase ERK phosphorylation. These results are consistent with the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol, forskolin, 8-CPT-cAMP, and dibutyryl-cAMP being mediated by PKA. Moreover, 6-Bnz-cAMP, which activates PKA but not Epac (38Christensen A.E. Selheim F. de Rooij J. Dremier S. Schwede F. Dao K.K. Martinez A. Maenhaut C. Bos J.L. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35394-35402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), produced inhibitory effects identical to those of the other effective agents, supporting the role of PKA in blocking the phosphorylation of ERK downstream of muscarinic, P2X7, and EGF receptor activation.Isoproterenol produced three distinct effects on different salivary cell preparations; it inhibited the carbachol-promoted stimulation of ERK phosphorylation in native rat parotid and submandibular acinar cells, it was without effect on carbachol-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in HSG and Par-C10 cells, and it itself stimulated ERK phosphorylation and did not block the stimulation by carbachol in HSY cells. It is unlikely that these varied responses are due to differences in muscarinic receptor subtypes, a family of 5 (M1-M5) isoforms that can all be stimulated by carbachol, a non-selective muscarinic agonist. Native rat parotid acinar cells have >90% M3R and small populations of other subtypes (2Dai Y.S. Ambudkar I.S. Horn V.J. Yeh C.K. Kousvelari E.E. Wall S.J. Li M. Yasuda R.P. Wolfe B.B. Baum B.J. Am.

M3Rs also make up the overwhelming majority of muscarinic receptors in HSG cells (52Nagy K. Szlávik V. Rácz G. Ovári G. Vág J. Varga G. Acta Physiol. Hung. 2007; 94: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Par-C5 cells (50Bockman C.S. Bradley M.E. Dang H.K. Zeng W. Scofield M.A. Dowd F.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 718-726PubMed Google Scholar), a rat parotid acinar cell line that is very similar to the Par-C10. However, HSY cells have a mixed population of M1 and M3 receptors, and both receptor subtypes contribute to the stimulation of ERK (53Lin A.L. Zhu B. Zhang W. Dang H. Zhang B.X. Katz M.S. Yeh C.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1454-C1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It was observed previously that the stimulation of ERK by carbachol (53Lin A.L. Zhu B. Zhang W.

Zhang B.X. Katz M.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C1357-C1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in HSY cells are EGFR-dependent, consistent with our finding that AG1478 was also effective on the combination of carbachol and isoproterenol. In fact, the EGFR plays a critical role in ERK signaling in all three cell lines under various stimulated and non-stimulated conditions. In contrast to these findings, the increase in ERK phosphorylation in carbachol-treated native rat parotid acinar cells does not involve the EGFR and is not sensitive to AG1478 (32Plourde D. Soltoff S.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C702-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This is one illustration of how normal cell signaling can differ between native cells and cell lines, indicating that care must be used in selecting a model cell system that represents native tissue.Parotid cells respond to secretagogues with rapid increases in the rate of O2 consumption (ΔQO2) due to increases in oxidative metabolism to support the increased energy demands of active ion transport, particularly the ATP demand of the stimulation of the Na,K-ATPase; therefore, this change in O2 consumption is reflective of an increase in fluid and electrolyte secretion (28Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cantley L.C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 54Murakami M. Miyamoto S. Imai Y. J. Physiol. 1990; 426: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The similar enhancing effects that 10−5 and 10−7 m isoproterenol had on the carbachol-promoted ΔQO2 (Fig. 10A) are consistent with the similar increases that these concentrations produced on PKA substrate phosphorylation and in the reduction of the carbachol-initiated ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Not surprisingly, isoproterenol produced similarly modest (∼10–20%) increases in the changes in [Ca2+]i and O2 consumption initiated by 10−5 m carbachol, consistent with the dependence of ion movement on [Ca2+]i.The isoproterenol and forskolin enhancements of the carbachol-promoted increases in [Ca2+]i are likely due to the PKA-mediated increased release of Ca2+ from internal Ca2+ stores, as this added release of Ca2+ was blocked by H-89 (Fig. 10F). The stimulatory effects of isoproterenol and forskolin on [Ca2+]i (and ΔQO2) are likely due to the phosphorylation of the InsP3 receptor by PKA. In mouse parotid acinar cells, forskolin promoted the phosphorylation of the InsP3 receptor, and dibutyryl-cAMP enhanced the InsP3-initiated release of Ca2+ from stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (14Bruce J.I. Shuttleworth T.J. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies determined that this effect was mediated by the PKA-promoted phosphorylation of Ser-937 on the InsP3 receptor 2 isoform (16Betzenhauser M.J. Fike J.L. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25116-25125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similar to our results for isoproterenol (Fig. 10, D and E), Bruce et al. (14Bruce J.I. Shuttleworth T.J. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) reported that forskolin also promoted an increase in Ca2+ entry, and suggested that this may be due to the larger release/depletion of Ca2+ stores under these conditions. On a different note, it recently was reported that cAMP generation and PKA activation can result from the depletion of Ca2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the activation of adenylyl cyclase was dependent on stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor that plays an integral role in store-operated Ca2+ entry (55Lefkimmiatis K. Srikanthan M. Maiellaro I. Moyer M.P. Curci S. Hofer A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Inhibitory effects of cAMP on ERK phosphorylation were also found in vasopressin-treated rat renal intermedullary cortical ducts. The binding of a vasopressin analog (dDAVP) to the V2 receptor in intermedullary cortical duct cells reduced the (basal) phosphorylation of ERK and MEK and increased the phosphorylation of RAF on Ser-259, and these effects were mimicked by a cAMP analog (56Pisitkun T. Jacob V. Schleicher S.M. Chou C.L. Yu M.J. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F1030-F1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). dDVAP did not affect the phosphorylation of RAF on Ser-338, but it also accelerated the appearance of aperiodic spikes in [Ca2+]i, which were due to release of Ca2+ by the ryanodine receptor. Thus, there are parallels in intermedullary cortical ducts between some, but not all, of the responses to isoproterenol that we observed in parotid acinar cells.In conclusion, the present studies document the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol and cAMP on ERK activation by carbachol in rat parotid and submandibular acinar cells. This suggests that the release of neurotransmitter from sympathetic nerves can prevent the activation of ERK by parasympathetic nerve stimulation. The effect on ERK appears to be due, at least in part, to changes in the phosphorylation of RAF on two sites that regulate RAF activity, Ser-259 and Ser-338, which are negative and positive sites, respectively. This negative regulation of ERK occurs in the same cell in which isoproterenol produces a positive effect on physiological events that promote and support muscarinic receptor-promoted fluid secretion. These studies demonstrate that there are multiple interactions between the second messengers and signaling proteins downstream of the β-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors and that the β-adrenergic receptor can exert both positive and negative effects on processes downstream of muscarinic receptor activation. In addition, isoproterenol also blocked increases in ERK phosphorylation downstream of the P2X7 receptor/ion channel and the EGF receptor. The results demonstrate that cAMP can inhibit ERK activation by a wide variety of receptor types. Our results also indicate that there are important differences between native salivary gland acinar cells and immortalized and transformed salivary cells regarding how second messengers affect signal transduction proteins. IntroductionAlmost all mammalian cells have multiple types of heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors. The muscarinic receptor and β-adrenergic receptor are G-protein-coupled receptors that affect the physiological activities of many cells, and neurotransmitters binding to these receptors produce well defined and mainly separate functional effects in salivary glands, which are innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons (1Proctor G.B. Carpenter G.H. Auton. Neurosci. 2007; 133: 3-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Parotid acinar cells express M3 muscarinic receptors (2Dai Y.S. Ambudkar I.S. Horn V.J. Yeh C.K. Kousvelari E.E. Wall S.J. Li M. Yasuda R.P. Wolfe B.B. Baum B.J. Am. J.

The increase in intracellular Ca2+ initiates the opening of ion channels, electrolyte and fluid secretion, and subsequently, the formation of saliva in the oral cavity (3Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation of parotid β-adrenergic receptors promotes exocytosis and the release of amylase protein into the oral cavity. β-Adrenergic receptors are coupled via Gs to adenylyl cyclase, and receptor stimulation generates the production of cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A (PKA)) and a signaling cascade downstream of PKA. Muscarinic receptors also can promote exocytosis, but this is more limited than that due to β-adrenergic signaling (4Yoshimura K. Murakami M. Segawa A. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In many cells cAMP also can activate exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac), which are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the GTPase Rap. Epac is a cAMP-dependent PKA-independent protein that can mediate various signaling and functional events in salivary glands and other cells (5Chaudhuri A. Husain S.Z. Kolodecik T.R. Grant W.M.

This can produce complications in evaluating the mechanisms of cross-talk that exist when there is combined muscarinic and β-adrenergic signaling, which is a focus of the present study.Isoproterenol has other effects on parotid acinar cells in addition to promoting exocytosis of secretory granules. It has been recognized for more than 40 years that the chronic systemic administration of the β-adrenergic ligand isoproterenol to rodents promotes enlargement of parotid salivary glands (8Schneyer C. Am. J. Physiol. 1962; 203: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Schneyer C.A. Humphreys-Beher M. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 256: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This is accompanied by increases in DNA synthesis and involves both hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Parotid glands from mice treated with isoproterenol for times up to 24 h display significant changes in the expression patterns of >40 genes, including cell cycle proteins, transcriptional factors, and kinases (10Ten Hagen K. Balys M.M. Tabak L.A. Melvin J.E. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 28: 107-114Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Treatment of rat parotid glands with isoproterenol (1–4 h) increased the tight junction permeability (11Mazariegos M.R. Hand A.R. J. Dent. Res. 1984; 63: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and acute exposure of dispersed rat parotid acini to isoproterenol enhanced the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter activity (12Paulais M. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21558-21563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although muscarinic and β-adrenergic receptors promote chiefly parallel signaling pathways and physiological events in salivary gland cells, there is both positive and negative cross-talk between these two important receptor-mediated signaling pathways. In primary cultures of mouse parotid acinar cells, carbachol and isoproterenol both increased the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (13Yamada K. Inoue H. Kida S. Masushige S. Nishiyama T. Mishima K. Saito I. Pathobiology. 2006; 73: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Isoproterenol and the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin increased the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by the muscarinic and α-adrenergic receptor stimulation in rodent parotid acinar cells, and this was due to the phosphorylation of the InsP3 receptor in a PKA-dependent manner (14Bruce J.I.

This offers an explanation for the stimulatory effect of cAMP production/PKA activation on fluid secretion in parotid and submandibular glands (17Larsson O. Olgart L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1989; 137: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Bobyock E. Chernick W.S. J. Dent.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C255-C265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, cross-talk between these receptors can go in both directions, as M3 muscarinic receptor stimulation can desensitize β2-adrenergic receptors via a PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor (20Budd D.C. Challiss R.A. Young K.W. Tobin A.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 813-823PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, M3 receptor stimulation by carbachol promotes a reduction in the isoproterenol-promoted production of cAMP in rodent parotid and submandibular cells (2Dai Y.S. Ambudkar I.S. Horn V.J.

In the present study we found that isoproterenol had a substantial negative effect on the carbachol-initiated phosphorylation of ERK in dispersed rat parotid acinar cells. Because cAMP can exert either positive or negative effects on ERK signaling in many cells (27Gerits N. Kostenko S. Shiryaev A. Johannessen M. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1592-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we examined the cross-talk between β-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors in more detail in several native salivary gland acinar cells and cell lines. We compared the effects of forskolin, cAMP analogs, and Epac-specific activators to the effects of isoproterenol on the stimulation of ERK phosphorylation by carbachol. We also examined the effects of isoproterenol on multiple physiological indices of fluid secretion as well as on ERK phosphorylation downstream of P2X7 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, neither of which is coupled to G-proteins. The results indicate that isoproterenol produces both positive and negative effects on muscarinic signaling within the same cell and can block ERK activation downstream of multiple types of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2057884946,"Phosphorylation regulates transcription factor activity by influencing dimerization, cellular localization, activation potential, and/or DNA binding. Nevertheless, precisely how this post-translation modification mediates these processes is poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of phosphorylation on the DNA-binding properties of MafA and MafB, closely related transcriptional activators of the basic-leucine zipper (b-Zip) family associated with cell differentiation and oncogenesis. Many common phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometry. However, dephosphorylation only precluded the detection of MafA dimers and consequently dramatically reduced DNA-binding ability. Analysis of MafA/B chimeras revealed that sensitivity to the phosphorylation status of MafA was imparted by sequences spanning the C-terminal dimerization region (amino acids (aa) 279–359), whereas the homologous MafB region (aa 257–323) conveyed phosphorylation-independent DNA binding. Mutational analysis showed that formation of MafA dimers capable of DNA binding required phosphorylation within the distinct N-terminal transactivation domain (aa 1–72) and not the C-terminal b-Zip region. These results demonstrate a novel relationship between the phosphoamino acid-rich transactivation and b-Zip domains in controlling MafA DNA-binding activity."

During microbial infections, proteases, such as elastases, cleave the carbohydrate recognition domains and can inactivate the innate immune functions of SP-D. Host responses to counterbalance the reduction of SP-D-mediated innate immune response under these conditions are not clearly understood. We have unexpectedly identified that SP-D could interact with protein fractions containing ovomucin and ovomacroglobulin. Here, we show that SP-D interacts with human α2-macroglobulin (A2M), a protease inhibitor present in the lungs and serum. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, surface plasmon resonance, and carbohydrate competition assays, we show that SP-D interacts with A2M both in solid phase (KD of 7.33 nm) and in solution via lectin-carbohydrate interactions under physiological calcium conditions. Bacterial agglutination assays further show that SP-D·A2M complexes increase the ability of SP-D to agglutinate bacteria. Western blot analyses show that SP-D, but not A2M, avidly binds bacteria. Interestingly, intact and activated A2M also protect SP-D against elastase-mediated degradation, and the cleaved A2M still interacts with SP-D and is able to enhance its agglutination abilities. We also found that SP-D and A2M can interact with each other in the airway-lining fluid. Therefore, we propose that SP-D utilizes a novel mechanism in which the collectin interacts with protease inhibitor A2M to decrease its degradation and to concurrently increase its innate immune function.

In contrast, hyperglycemia alters responsiveness to IGF-I, resulting in increased SHPS-1 phosphorylation and assembly of a signaling complex that enhances MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways. Hyperglycemia also reduces the basal IRS-1 concentration and IGF-I-stimulated IRS-1-linked signaling. To determine if failure to down-regulate IRS-1 alters vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) responses to IGF-I, we overexpressed IRS-1 in VSMCs maintained in high glucose. These cultures showed reduced SHPS-1 phosphorylation, transfer of SHP-2 to SHPS-1, and impaired Shc and MAPK phosphorylation and cell proliferation in response to IGF-I. In vitro studies demonstrated that SHPS-1 was a substrate for type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR) and that IRS-1 competitively inhibited SHPS-1 phosphorylation. Exposure of VSMC cultures to a peptide that inhibited IRS-1/IGF-IR interaction showed that IRS-1 binding to IGF-IR impairs SHPS-1 phosphorylation in vivo. IRS-1 also sequestered SHP-2.

Upon ligand occupancy, the receptor undergoes a conformational change that activates its tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates downstream signaling molecules.

Our studies have shown that SHPS-1 phosphorylation and the subsequent assembly of a signaling complex that includes SHP-2, Src, Shc (Src homology 2 domain-containing protein), and Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) is essential for these cells to respond to hyperglycemic stress and that it enhances the ability of IGF-I to activate both MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, leading to increased proliferation and migration (2Ling Y.

Following their tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1 and Shc bind independently to Grb2, which increases activation of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (2Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J.

However, the relative contribution of Shc and IRS-1 in regulating this cascade has not been clearly delineated for many different cell types (12Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol.

Additionally, IRS-1 concentrations are regulated by several factors, including glucose, insulin, IGF-I, and cell/tissue type (24Saad M.J. Araki E. Miralpeix M. Rothenberg P.L. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J.

Several investigators have demonstrated that IRS-1 concentrations are down-regulated in response to hyperglycemia in insulin-sensitive tissues as skeletal muscle and fat (13Gual P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Biochimie. 2005; 87: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 31Carvalho E. Rondinone C. Smith U. Mol.

Previously, we reported that VSMCs maintained in high glucose concentrations (>12 mm) had a significant decrease in IRS-1. We also showed that the IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation response and subsequent Grb2 binding are significantly reduced in response to IGF-I (29Maile L.A. Capps B.E. Ling Y. Xi G. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These studies were undertaken to determine the significance of the reduction in IRS-1 and whether failure to reduce the IRS-1 concentration alters assembly of the SHPS-1 complex, thus leading to altered cell proliferation and migration in response to IGF-I. Human IGF-I was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Immobilon-P membranes were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). DMEM containing 4500 mg/liter glucose (DMEM-HG), DMEM containing 900 mg/liter glucose (DMEM-NG), and streptomycin and penicillin were purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies against phospho-MAPK or total MAPK and β-actin were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibodies for IRS-1, SHPS-1, and Shc were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)99), the hemagglutinin epitope (HA), anti-IRS-1, anti-IGF-IR, anti-SHP-2, and anti-Grb2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). SHPS-1 and IGF-IR polyclonal antiserum were prepared in our laboratory. IGF-IR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PQ401, was purchased from Tocris Bioscience, (Ellisville, MO). Recombinant rat IRS-1 expressed in Sf9 cells with His tag was purchased from Millipore Corp. Synthetic peptides containing the cell permeability sequence of protein transduction domain 4 and the sequence from IGF-IR YARAAARQARA947NPEYFSAADV956 (underlined and hereafter referred to as peptide 299), the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of p299 peptide (corresponding to Tyr950 of IGF-IR), and the sequence from the IRS-1 PTB domain YARAAARQARA206LQLMNIRRCGHS217 (underlined and hereafter referred to as peptide 301, where C is italicized to denote reduction) were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Purity and sequence confirmation were determined by mass spectrometry. We used a heterologous system in this study. It is important to note that the sequences in porcine IGF-IR that bind to IRS-1 are conserved in human IGF-IR. Likewise, the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase sequence is completely conserved when human and porcine IGF-IR are compared. Similarly, the PTB domain of porcine IRS-1 has 100% homology to human IRS-1. Finally, porcine IGF-I and human IGF-I have 100% sequence identity. Therefore, we believe that this degree of sequence conservation enables us to study these interactions interchangeably. The SHPS-1 cytoplasmic domain containing amino acids 394–503 was PCR-amplified with the SP6 promotor sequence, following which reverse transcription was performed to obtain mRNA (33Shen X. Xi G. Radhakrishnan Y. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2009; 8: 1539-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using this template, SHPS-1/CD was generated, employing in vitro translation using wheat germ extract as per the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega). The mouse fibroblasts (NWTb3) that overexpress human IGF-IR were a kind gift from Dr. Derek LeRoith (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York) (34Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). IGF-IR was purified using NWTb3 cell lysate (25 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing protease inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), EDTA (2 mm), and Triton X-100 (0.2%)) diluted 1:5 with buffer containing (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m ammonium sulfate, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The diluted lysate was applied to a butyl-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 m ammonium sulfate and 0.02% Triton X-100. After sample loading, the column was washed with equilibration buffer and eluted with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.02% Triton X-100. Fractions containing IGF-IR were detected following SDS-PAGE with immunoblotting. The fractions containing the receptor were further purified using concanavalin A chromatography. CaCl2 and MnCl2 were added to final concentrations of 4 and 2 mm, respectively, and the solution was applied to a concanavalin A-Sepharose column, equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 0.02% Triton X-100. The IGF-IR was eluted with the above buffer containing 0.25 m methyl α-d-glucopyranoside and 0.25 m methyl α-d-mannopyranoside. The purified IGF-IR was incubated with 150 ng/ml IGF-I and 10 mm ATP in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 3 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm Na3O4 and incubated for 15 min for 30 min. IGF-IR activation was determined by immunoblotting using anti-Tyr(P)99 antibody. The activated IGF-IR was used to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of SHPS-1 in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 3 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3O4, and 0.2 mm ATP and incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. To determine phosphorylation of SHPS-1/CD, the final product was immunoblotted using an anti-Tyr(P)99 antibody. Porcine SMCs were isolated from the porcine aortic explants according to the protocol described by Ross (74Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) and were maintained as described previously (2Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Maile L.A. Capps B.E. Ling Y. Xi G. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM-high glucose growth medium (HG) or DMEM-normal glucose growth medium (NG) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), streptomycin (100 ng/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). All of the mutant cells were maintained in HG. The SMCs that were used in these experiments were used between passages 4 and 12. Wild type IGF-IR in pBluescript II KS was a kind gift from Dr. Derek LeRoith. Using this as a template, PCR amplification was performed with forward primer 5′-caccatgaagtctggctccggaggagggt-3′, including a Kozak sequence (in boldface type) placed 5′ to the ATG (underlined) start site. The reverse primer 5′-ttaagcgtaatctggaacatcgtatgggtagcaggtcgaagactggggcagcgg-3′ contained the sequence encoding HA epitope (underlined), followed by the stop codon (boldface type). The amplified product was cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO Gateway entry vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The resultant product was confirmed by sequencing (University of North Carolina Genome Analysis Facility, Chapel Hill, NC) and transferred from the entry vector into the pLentiCMV DEST vector using the LR clonase reaction following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Full-length human IRS-1 cDNA was purchased from Open Biosystems in pCMV-sport6 vector and after PCR amplification was cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO Gateway entry vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The forward and reverse primers used to generate the PCR product were as follows: forward primer, 5′-caccatggcgagccctccggagagcgat-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ttaagcgtaatctggaacatcgtatgggtactgacggtcctctggctgcttctgg-3′. The forward primer includes a Kozak sequence (boldface type) placed 5′ to the ATG (underlined) start site. The reverse primer contained the sequence encoding HA epitope (underlined) followed by the stop codon (boldface type). The resultant product was sequenced (UNC Genome Analysis Facility, Chapel Hill, NC) to confirm the correct full-length human IRS-1 using M13 forward and reverse primers and five other primers: IRS-1Seq1A, 5′-gggtcagacaaagaacctgatt-3′; IRS-1Seq2A, 5′-cgcccagcctcggtgga-3′; IRS-1Seq3A, 5′-ctaccattacccaccagaag-3′; IRS-1Seq4A, 5′-tgactacatgaacatgtcacca-3′; IRS-1Seq5C, 5′-tgaccatgcagatgagttgtcc-3′. Using the pENTR IRS-1-WT as template, an IRS mutant was generated where the tyrosines at positions 1179 and 1229 were mutated to phenylalanine (IRS-FF). PCR amplifications were carried out using complementary primer 5′-ggagaatggtcttaactTcatagacctggatttgg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ccaaatccaggtctatgAagttaagaccattctcc-3′ to generate Y1179F and another complementary primer 5′-gaggatttaagcgcctTtgccagcatcag-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ctgatgctggcaAaggcgcttaaatcctc-3′ to generate Y1229F (where capitalized bases indicate the substitutions). After selection of correct clone based on DNA sequencing, using pENTR IRS-FF as template, a double mutant was constructed where three arginines at positions 212, 213, and 227 were mutated to glutamine (IRS-R3Q-FF) using double-stranded mutagenesis. Initially, PCR amplification was carried out using forward primer 5′-gctgatgaacatcCAgcAAtgtggccactcgg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ccgagtggccacaTTgcTGgatgttcatcagc-3′ (where capitalized bases indicate the substitutions), by which two of the residues, Arg212 and Arg213, were mutated to glutamine. The resultant DNA was used as a template, and the arginine at position 227 was mutated to glutamine using complementary primers 5′-catcgaggtgggccAAtctgccgtgacgggg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ccccgtcacggcagaTTggcccacctcgatg-3′ (where capitalized bases indicate the substitution). The products were sequenced (University of North Carolina Genome Analysis Facility) to confirm the correct incorporation of the changes, following which the cDNAs encoding the wild type, single mutant, and double mutant forms of the protein were transferred from the entry vector into pLentiCMV DEST vector using the LR clonase reaction following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Based on Invitrogen web site design tools, a sequence containing 21 oligonucleotides (GCGAGGATTTAAGCGCCTATG) located within the porcine IRS-1 (accession number EU681268.1; nucleotides 3515–3536) was used to construct the short hairpin RNA template plasmid. The selected sequences were not found in any other mammalian protein searched using the NCBI Blast search program. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Nucleic Acids Core Facility at the University of North Carolina, annealed, and ligated into BLOCK-iT U6 RNAi entry vector (catalogue no. K4945-00, Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. The complete sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The expression vector was generated using the Gateway LR recombination reaction between the entry vector and BLOCK-iT Lentiviral RNAi Gateway Vector (catalogue no. K4943-00, Invitrogen). The empty vector was used as a control (EVC). After confirmation of the sequence, plasmid DNA was prepared by a Plasmid minikit (Promega, Madison, WI). 293FT cells (Invitrogen) were prepared for generation of virus stocks of each individual pLenti construct. All of the transfections and viral stock generations were carried out as described previously (2Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Radhakrishnan Y. Maile L.A. Ling Y. Graves L.M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol.

VSMCs (passages 4 and 5) were seeded at 3 × 105/well in each of two wells of a 6-well plate (catalog no. 353046, Falcon) the day before transduction. The viral stocks were thawed, and the viral complexes were precipitated as described previously (2Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Radhakrishnan Y. Maile L.A. Ling Y. Graves L.M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16320-16331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The expression of the HA-tagged IRS-1-WT and IRS-1 mutants were detected by immunoblotting with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HA antibody using 20 μg of protein. Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/10-cm plate (BD Biosciences) and grown for 5–7 days to reach confluence. The cultures were incubated in serum-free DMEM-HG for 14–18 h before the addition of IGF-I (as indicated). In some experiments, non-transduced SMCs were preincubated with or without the synthetic peptides for 1–2 h before IGF-I was added. Following cell lysis, all immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (2Ling Y. Maile L.A. Lieskovska J. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Radhakrishnan Y. Maile L.A. Ling Y. Graves L.M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16320-16331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The images obtained were also scanned using DuoScan scanning densitometer (Agfa, Morstel, Belgium). Densitometric analyses of the images were determined using National Institutes of Health ImageJ, version 1.37v. To determine differences in MAPK phosphorylation, arbitrary scanning units obtained for phospho-MAPK band intensities were divided by arbitrary scanning units obtained for total β-actin protein band intensities for each time point analyzed. The -fold values or average ratio values obtained from at least three independent experiments for each lane were pooled together. Assessment of SMC proliferation was performed as described previously (35Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). IGF-I is known to stimulate smooth muscle cell chemokinesis, and cellular migration was analyzed as previously described (36Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, VSMCs were plated in 6-well dishes and grown to confluence. The monolayer of cells was wounded with a razor blade. After wounding, cells were incubated with SFM plus 0.2% FBS in the presence or absence of IGF-I (50 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 48 h. The wounded monolayers were then fixed and stained (Diff Quick; Dade Behring, Inc., Newark, DE), and the number of cells migrating into the wound area was counted. At least five of the previously selected 1-mm areas at the edge of the wound were counted for each data point. Student's t test was used to compare the differences between the treatments. The results that are shown in all experiments are representative of at least three separate experiments, and p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. VSMCs that were maintained in 25 mm glucose (DMEM-HG) and then changed to serum-free medium containing the same glucose concentration for 12 h had a significant decrease in total IRS-1 levels (1.8 ± 0.1-fold, n = 3, p < 0.01) compared with cells that were exposed to 5 mm glucose (DMEM-NG). The degree of decrease in IRS-1 was maintained after 24 h (1.9 ± 0.1-fold, n = 3, p < 0.01) and 48 h (2.4 ± 0.2-fold, n = 3, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A, top). Similar cultures stimulated with IGF-I for 24 and 48 h showed a significant additional decrease (1.9 ± 0.1-fold at 24 h and 1.7 ± 0.2-fold at 48 h, n = 3, p < 0.01) in total IRS-1 in DMEM-HG compared with VSMCs not exposed to IGF-I (Fig. 1A, middle). Consistent with our previous observations, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (corrected for changes in total IRS-1) in response to IGF-I was significantly reduced (4.2 ± 0.3-fold, n = 5, p < 0.001) in DMEM-HG cells compared with DMEM-NG cells (Fig. 1B). Grb2 association with IRS-1 was significantly decreased (8.1 ± 0.1-fold, n = 5, p < 0.001) in DMEM-HG cells compared with DMEM-NG cultured cells in response to IGF-I (Fig. 1B). In order to determine the effect of maintaining a higher level of IRS-1 than would normally be present in hyperglycemic conditions on IGF-I actions, VSMCs overexpressing HA-tagged IRS-1 (IRS-WT) were constructed. The basal total IRS-1 protein level was higher (5.2 ± 0.1-fold, n = 5, p < 0.001) in IRS-WT cells maintained in DMEM-HG compared with LacZ control cells (Fig. 1C). Following exposure to IGF-I, IRS-1 was reduced to a significantly greater extent in the LacZ cells (2.6 ± 0.2-fold decrease) compared with a 1.9 ± 0.1-fold decrease in IRS-1 WT cells (n = 3, p < 0.01; Fig. 1D). Cellular proliferation in IRS-WT-overexpressing cells maintained in DMEM-HG was significantly impaired (1.1 ± 0.3-fold increase) compared with LacZ control cells (1.98 ± 0.1-fold increase) in response to IGF-I (n = 5, p < 0.05; Fig. 2A). Similarly, VSMC migration in response to IGF-I was significantly reduced (1.97 ± 0.1-fold reduction, n = 4, p < 0.05) in IRS-WT cells maintained in DMEM-HG compared with LacZ cont"

https://openalex.org/W1988213013,"Arrestins are multifunctional adaptor proteins best known for their role in regulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Arrestins also regulate other types of receptors, including the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), although the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the IGF-1R ortholog DAF-2 regulates dauer formation, stress resistance, metabolism, and lifespan through a conserved signaling cascade. To further elucidate the role of arrestin in IGF-1R signaling, we employed an in vivo approach to investigate the role of ARR-1, the sole arrestin ortholog in C. elegans, on longevity. Here, we report that ARR-1 functions to positively regulate DAF-2 signaling in C. elegans. arr-1 mutant animals exhibit increased longevity and enhanced nuclear localization of DAF-16, an indication of decreased DAF-2 signaling, whereas animals overexpressing ARR-1 have decreased longevity. Genetic and biochemical analysis reveal that ARR-1 functions to regulate DAF-2 signaling via direct interaction with MPZ-1, a multi-PDZ domain-containing protein, via a C-terminal PDZ binding domain in ARR-1. Interestingly, ARR-1 and MPZ-1 are found in a complex with the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) ortholog DAF-18, which normally serves as a suppressor of DAF-2 signaling, suggesting that these three proteins work together to regulate DAF-2 signaling. Our results suggest that the ARR-1-MPZ-1-DAF-18 complex functions to regulate DAF-2 signaling in vivo and provide insight into a novel mechanism by which arrestin is able to regulate IGF-1R signaling and longevity.

https://openalex.org/W2092126330,"Resistance to drug treatments underlies the high lethality of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Along with others, we have recently identified that proteasome inhibition is a promising therapeutic option in this highly refractory disease. The pleiotropic effects of proteasome inhibition include the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways and also antiapoptotic signaling pathways such as EGFR, AKT and the MAP kinases that reduce the apoptotic potential of this class of drug. In this study, we sought to determine the mechanism behind the activation of EGFR in response to proteasome inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells. We found that the second-generation proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 induced the mRNA transcription of several EGFR family ligands (EGF, HB-EGF and epiregulin), however only increases in HB-EGF were detected at the protein level. Using both pharmacological inhibitors and lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown of EGFR ligand expression, we discovered that ligand cleavage by MMP/ADAMs and HB-EGF expression is required for activation of EGFR in response to proteasome inhibition. Furthermore, we discover that induction of HB-EGF is dependent on reactive oxygen species and p38-MAPK signaling but not ERK and that the transcription factor SP-1 is involved in NPI-0052-induced HB-EGF transcription. Together, these results indicate that stress signaling leading to induction of HB-EGF expression and increases in MMP/ADAM-dependent HB-EGF cleavage are responsible for proteasome inhibitor-induced activation of EGFR in pancreatic cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061590813,"Oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species is believed to be a contributor to the development of cancer and the physiological deterioration associated with aging. In this report, we describe the effect of reactive oxygen species exposure to a developing Caenorhabditis elegans organism containing a deletion in the homolog of BRCA1-associated protein 2 (BRAP-2). A mutant containing a deletion of brap-2 was highly sensitive to oxidizing conditions and demonstrated early larval arrest and lethality at low concentrations of the oxidative stress-inducing drug paraquat compared with the wild-type. This developmental arrest occurred early in the L1 stage and was dependent specifically on the function of the C. elegans ortholog of BRCA-1 tumor suppressor brc-1. We also show that developmental arrest in brap-2 mutants when exposed to oxidative stress was due to enhanced expression levels of the cell cycle inhibitor cki-1, and this increase in the expression levels of cki-1 requires brc-1 in brap-2 mutant animals. Our findings demonstrate that BRAP-2 is necessary for preventing an inappropriate response to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species by countering premature activation of BRC-1 and CKI-1.

Our findings demonstrate that BRAP-2 is necessary for preventing an inappropriate response to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species by countering premature activation of BRC-1 and CKI-1. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviation used is: ROSreactive oxygen species. is known to lead to cytoplasmic and nuclear damage and has been implicated in many age-related diseases including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and cancer (1Weinberg F. Chandel N.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3663-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways become activated by cells to limit the insult from ROS by generating antioxidant proteins (e.g. superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase proteins), which remove high levels of ROS, along with other pathways that are activated to mend the damage by ROS that induce cell cycle arrest, activate DNA repair mechanisms, and promote ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of modified proteins (2Burhans W.C. Heintz N.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1282-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). If the cellular damage is too great to be repaired, apoptosis of the inflicted cell occurs (3Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). reactive oxygen species. A group of proteins that monitor the cell for excessive damage from genotoxic or oxidative stress are tumor suppressor genes, such as BRCA1, p53, and the RB tumor suppressor (4Steele R.J. Thompson A.M. Hall P.A. Lane D.P. Brit. J. Surgery. 1998; 85: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). BRCA1 has been studied extensively because mutations in the gene predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers and is important for DNA damage response and preventing tumor development (5Thompson D. Easton D.F. the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 1358-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). To maintain genomic integrity, BRCA1 also plays an important role in regulating cell cycle progression through a number of distinct pathways that include p21WAF1/CIP1, p53, and RB (6Somasundaram K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Model organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, have proven to be very useful in studying the function and signaling pathways of BRCA1. The BRCA1 ortholog (brc-1) is involved in DNA repair (8Boulton S.J. Martin J.S. Polanowska J. Hill D.E. Gartner A. Vidal M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 33-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and is required for double-stranded repair and responsible for E3-ubiquitin ligase activity at DNA damage sites following ionizing radiation (9Adamo A.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2178-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). BRC-1 carries out these functions with its heterodimeric partner, BRD-1 (8Boulton S.J. Martin J.S. Polanowska J. Hill D.E. Gartner A. Vidal M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 33-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a complex whose interaction is conserved between the mammalian homologs BRCA1 and BARD1 (9Adamo A. Montemauri P. Silva N. Ward J.D. Boulton S.J. La Volpe A. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Upon genotoxic stress, the BRC-1·BRD-1 complex interacts with chromatin and LET-70, the C. elegans homolog of the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc5, and this interaction results in the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2-conjugating enzyme to the site of DNA damage for DNA repair (10Polanowska J. Martin J.S. Garcia-Muse T. Petalcorin M.I. Boulton S.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2178-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our interest is in the C. elegans homolog of Brap2, a protein associated with the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 (11Li S. Ku C.Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.S. Chen C.F. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and is also known as IMP (impedes mitogenic signal propagation) (12Matheny S.A. Chen C. Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Brap2 is a cytoplasmic protein capable of binding the nuclear localization signal motifs of BRCA1, preventing it from localizing into the nucleus (11Li S. Ku C.Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.S. Chen C.F. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), although the relevance of this interaction has not yet been demonstrated. Brap2 also binds the nuclear localization signal motifs found in the SV40 large T antigen, mitosin, and p21 during monocyte differentiation (11Li S. Ku C.Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.S. Chen C.F. Lee W.H.

Biotechnol. Lett. 2009; 31: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized the C. elegans homolog of Brap2 called brap-2 and found that a deletion mutant of brap-2 is sensitive to oxidative stress during development, with exposure to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat leading to developmental arrest and lethality early in L1. Furthermore, developmental arrest was coordinated with increased expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitor cki-1 in seam cells. We also demonstrated that the growth arrest under oxidative stress conditions in the absence of brap-2 is dependent on the BRCA1 ortholog in C. elegans, brc-1. Finally, we demonstrated that the deletion of brc-1 decreases the levels of cki-1 expression, illustrating that the C. elegans homolog of BRCA1 is involved in cell cycle progression and that this function is conserved between nematodes and humans. Therefore, BRAP-2 is important for preventing an inappropriate response to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species by countering premature activation of BRC-1 and CKI-1. For normal and mutant strains, the worms are grown in agar plates containing a strain of Escherichia coli bacteria called OP50, as described by Brenner (15Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strain RB1346, which contains the brap-2(ok1492) deletion, was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and backcrossed three times to create the YF15 strain. Other strains used include N2, MT10430 (lin-35(n745)I), YF66 (lin-35(n745)I; brap-2(ok1492)II), CF1038 (daf-16(mu86)I), YF19 (daf-16(mu86)I; brap-2(ok1492)II), TJ1 (cep-1(gk138)I), YF63 (cep-1(gk138)I; brap-2(ok1492)II), DW102 (brc-1(tm1145)III), YF64 (brap-2(ok1492)II; brc-1(tm1145)III), VT825 (maIs113(cki-1::GFP)), YF69 (brap-2(ok1492)II; maIs113(cki-1::GFP)), PD4666 (ayIs6(hlh-8::GFP)) and YF73 (brap-2(ok1492)II; ayIs6(hlh-8::GFP)). All double mutants were created using standard C. elegans techniques and confirmed by single worm PCR to identify deletions when possible. Primers used for PCR are available upon request. A worm from the YF15 (brap-2 (okl492)) was placed in 4 μl of 1× polymerase and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K buffer and frozen at −80 °C for 1 h, incubated at 65 °C for 1 h, and incubated at 95 °C for 15 min to inactivate proteinase K. Single worm PCR was then completed, and the PCR product was purified using the GelElute PCR cleanup kit and sequenced. Paraquat was purchased from Sigma (PS366) in powder form. To generate the concentration series of paraquat, a stock of 0.2 m paraquat was added to 250 μl of filtered H2O at the appropriate dilutions, added to 35 mm unseeded nematode growth plates, and allowed to dry overnight. The plates were seeded with OP50 the next day. The following day, adult worms of various genotypes were placed on the plates, allowed to lay eggs for 8 h, and removed. The progeny were then scored every day for a period of 7 days for developmental arrest, lethality, or as able to develop to an adult. Progeny that reached late L4 or the adult stage were removed to prevent them from laying eggs on the paraquat-containing plates. Progeny of various strains carrying the reporter constructs maIs113(cki-1::GFP) and ayIs6(hlh-8::GFP) after oxidative stress treatment were mounted on 2% agarose pads in M9 buffer containing 2 mm levamisole and were visualized using an Olympus BX61 confocal microscope. We set out to determine the developmental and signaling function of the Brap2 homolog in C. elegans. A homolog of Brap2 was identified and is the gene designated EEED8.16. Sequence analysis of the primary amino acid structure of EEED8.16 indicated that it is 36% identical to human Brap2, and it has the identical protein domains as Brap2 (Fig. 1A). The recognized domains in EEED8.16 from the N terminus are the Brap2 homology domain, an H2-RING finger domain, a UBP-zinc finger domain and a region consisting of the leucine heptad repeats. Attempts to find the Brap2 homology domain in another protein within the C. elegans genome failed. Based on the sequence identity between EEED8.16 and Brap2 and the similarity of their domain architecture, we conclude that EEED8.16 is the C. elegans homolog of Brap2 and named it brap-2. We obtained a strain containing a deletion of brap-2 from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. This mutant (ok1492) contains a 1540-nucleotide deletion, removing exons 5–8 (Fig. 1C). The mutant BRAP-2 protein is predicted to be missing its final 256 amino acids, which consists of the UBP-zinc finger and leucine heptad repeat. The leucine heptad repeat region is usually necessary for homodimerization, and potentially both domains are involved in protein-protein interaction. Therefore, disruption of this region on BRAP-2 would probably severely impair the cellular function of the protein (16Jaya P. Premkumar M. Varman Thampan R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1499: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the N terminus portion of the protein containing the Brap2 homology domain and the H2-RING finger may still be expressed, so, at the moment, we cannot rule out that expression of the truncated protein does not have an effect. During the course of characterizing the brap-2 mutant, we tested its susceptibility to a number of stress-inducing conditions. One condition that produced a marked affect was the inclusion of H2O2 in the nematode growth medium/agar plates used for maintaining the animals. Our assay involved placing adult hermaphroditic worms on H2O2-containing plates and monitoring the development of the F1 generation over a period of 7 days. In both the presence of H2O2 and paraquat, brap-2 mutant nematodes demonstrated larval arrest and lethality, whereas wild-type N2 worms did not (Fig. 2, A and B). This effect was irreversible, as transfer of these arrested animals to non-paraquat-containing plates failed to develop. L1 arrest and lethality of brap-2(ok1492) was fully penetrant at the initial concentration tested (2 mm hydrogen peroxide), whereas N2 worms developed normally. Subsequently, we determined the concentration dependence of brap-2 sensitivity to oxidative stress. For this assay, we seeded our plates with a solution containing the chemical paraquat, which generates superoxide radicals in vivo (17Tawe W.N. Eschbach M.L. Walter R.D. Henkle-Dührsen K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1621-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), prior to seeding the plates with OP50. Adult hermaphrodites were then placed on these plates and allowed to lay eggs, and the F1 generation was monitored for 7 days. The brap-2 mutant demonstrated a graded response to increasing concentration of paraquat and began to show susceptibility to oxidative stress at a concentration of 0.05 mm paraquat, with an increase in the number of L1 animals remaining on the plate after 7 days and resulted in complete arrest or death at a concentration of 0.2 mm (Fig. 2C). N2 worms, on the other hand, developed normally until 0.5 mm (Fig. 2C) and did not demonstrate complete arrest/death until 5 mm paraquat (data not shown). The brap-2 gene is present on chromosome II and is part of an operon that includes the genes for an RNA-binding protein (EEED8.10) and the C. elegans homolog of the human PINK1 gene pink-1 (EEED8.9). To rescue the deletion strain for sensitivity to oxidative stress, we created transgenic worms containing the EEED8 cosmid (Fig. 2C). The transgene (tqEx34) was crossed into the brap-2 deletion strain, and animals were tested for their ability to develop in the presence of 0.1 mm paraquat. While in the absence of the transgene, brap-2 mutant worms displayed severe developmental arrest (only 3% reach the adult stage); in the presence of the transgene, >28% were able to develop completely through the larval stages, indicating that the EEED8 cosmid is capable of rescuing the oxidative sensitivity phenotype of the brap-2 deletion strain. Furthermore, we tested the transgene containing worms at higher concentrations of paraquat to determine whether the overexpressing brap-2 may lead to oxidative stress resistance, but it showed the same susceptibility to oxidative stress as N2 worms (data not shown). We also determined the time of onset of L1 arrest by examining M-cell divisions (18Kniazeva M. Euler T. Han M. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2102-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Wild-type worms under normal growth conditions hatch with a single M-cell that initially divides 5–6 h posthatching to form 16 cells by the end of L1 (19Sulston J.E. Horvitz H.R. Dev. Biol. 1977; 56: 110-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (2485) Google Scholar). M-cell divisions of developing larvae can be monitored using the integrated transgenic reporter construct hlh-8::gfp. For the majority of brap-2 worms developing on 0.2 mm paraquat plates (74%, n = 31), larval arrest occurred very early in L1, where between 1 and 4 M-cells were apparent from the presence of hlh-8::gfp expressing cells (Fig. 3C). L1 diapause is a distinctive type of developmental option that occurs upon starvation (20Baugh L.R. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 780-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 21Henderson S.T. Bonafe M. Johnson T.E. J. Gerontol. 2006; 61: 444-460Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Fukuyama M. Gendreau S.B. Derry W.B. Rothman J.H. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because there is a similarity between starvation-inducing L1 arrest and brap-2 mutation exposed to oxidative stress, we set out to determine whether the two mechanisms affect common regulators of postembryonic growth and development. L1 diapause that results from nutrient deprivation requires the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor that is repressed by the AGE-1/phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway because worms lacking DAF-16 fail to arrest upon nutrient deprivation (20Baugh L.R. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 780-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 21Henderson S.T. Bonafe M. Johnson T.E. J. Gerontol. 2006; 61: 444-460Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine whether the L1 developmental arrest of brap-2 worms upon exposure to oxidative stress required DAF-16, a double mutant of brap-2 and daf-16 was generated. We found that deleting daf-16 did not prevent L1 arrest caused by the brap-2 mutation, as 100% of brap-2 mutant were dead or arrested during development in the presence of paraquat versus 99% of the daf-16;brap-2 (Table 1). This indicates that the L1 arrest seen in brap-2 upon oxidative stress does not require daf-16, is not due to nutrient deprivation, and involves a distinct pathway.TABLE 1Larval arrest and lethality of brap-2 mutants do not require daf-16GenotypeLarval lethalityLarval arrestAdult%Wild-type (177)00100brap-2 (105)9910daf-16 (159)1099daf-16;brap-2 (132)9181 Open table in a new tab Mammalian Brap2 was originally identified as an associated protein of BRCA1 (11Li S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) capable of binding BRCA1 nuclear localization signal by yeast two-hybrid, although the biological significance of this interaction has not been demonstrated. C. elegans contains a BRCA1 homolog, called BRC-1, which is required for DNA repair upon UV radiation (8Boulton S.J. Martin J.S. Polanowska J. Hill D.E. Gartner A. Vidal M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 33-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further investigate the biological role of brc-1 and to determine whether the developmental arrest seen in brap-2(ok1492) animals under oxidative stress requires a functional brc-1 gene, we created a double brap-2;brc-1 mutant, placed the adult hermaphrodites on 0.1 mm paraquat containing plates and monitored the F1 worms for 7 days. Unlike the brap-2(ok1492) worms, a significant number (39% for the double mutant compared with 3% for brap-2) of the brap-2;brc-1 animals were capable of developing to adult stage (Table 2).TABLE 2Larval arrest and lethality of brap-2 mutants require brc-1GenotypeLarval lethalityLarval arrestAdult%Wild-type (295)00100brap-2 (142)9910brc-1 (200)00100brap-2;brc-1 (106)95239lin-35 (109)02377lin-35;brap-2 (82)10000cep-1 (161)87022cep-1;brap-2 (120)61372 Open table in a new tab Mammalian BRCA1 cell cycle arrest activity has been shown to be dependent on p53 and Rb (23Aprelikova O.N. Fang B.S. Meissner E.G. Cotter S. Campbell M. Kuthiala A. Bessho M. Jensen R.A. Liu E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11866-11871Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24MacLachlan T.K. Takimoto R. El-Deiry W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4280-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the Rb and p53 homologs in C. elegans (lin-35 and cep-1) to determine whether the developmental arrest of the brap-2 mutant in the presence of oxidative stress required the function of these two genes. Double mutants were synthesized carrying the brap-2(ok1492) with lin-35(n745) and brap-2(ok1492) with cep-1(gk138) and tested for their ability to develop in the presence of paraquat. It was apparent that lin-35 was completely unable to rescue the oxidative stress-inducing larval arrest phenotype of brap-2 minus worms, indicating that lin-35 was not required (Table 2). However, removal of cep-1 function moderately prevented larval lethality (61% versus 91% lethality for brap-2 alone; Table 2) and further development through the L3 or L4 stages (data not shown), but the double mutant strain was not able to develop completely to the adult stage. Therefore, developmental arrest and lethality in brap-2 worms exposed to oxidative stress appears to require brc-1 specifically and is independent of lin-35 and cep-1. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor cki-1 is required for developmental cell-cycle arrest including embryonic cell cycle exit and timing of postembryonic cell divisions (22Fukuyama M. Gendreau S.B. Derry W.B. Rothman J.H. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Hong Y. Roy R. Ambros V. Development. 1998; 125: 3585-3597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cki-1 is highly expressed in the V lineage, also known as seam/blast cells, which divide asymmetrically during early larva development and contribute to the lateral epidermal seam as the worm body elongates. To test whether cki-1 expression levels were altered during development of brap-2 mutants in the presence of oxidative stress, transgenic worms brap-2 deletion mutants that contain the cki-1::GFP transcriptional reporter construct were exposed to paraquat and showed high expression within the seam cells (compare Fig. 4, A and B) indicating that these blast cells have arrested cell cycle progression at lower concentrations of paraquat than do wild-type nematodes. In mammals, BRCA-1 has been demonstrated to induce p21 in cultured human cancer cells to inhibit progression of the cell cycle (6Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that cki-1 expression levels is affected by the brc-1 deletion, we created transgenic worms that contained the cki-1::GFP transcriptional reporter in the brap-2;brc-1 double mutants. When exposed to paraquat plates, these worms failed to show elevated levels of cki-1 gene expression (Fig. 4C), indicating that the requirement of brc-1 to induce developmental arrest of brap-2 mutants under oxidative stress is due to the induction of cki-1 gene expression. C. elegans has demonstrated to be a useful organism for studying oxidative stress response, with numerous studies showing mutants with sensitivity to the paraquat during adulthood. In this study, we investigated the effect of superoxide radicals in the developing organism. At high concentrations, wild-type worms exhibit larval arrest and lethality during chronic exposure, whereas at much lower concentrations, a mutant of the Brap2 homolog (brap-2) in C. elegans is hypersensitive to paraquat during development. This hypersensitivity was shown to involve an increase in gene expression of the cell cycle inhibitor cki-1 in blast/seam cells, suggesting that cell cycle arrest is occurring during larval development of brap-2 worms under these conditions. Furthermore, we found that a genetic interaction between BRCA1 and Brap2 is functionally relevant as the larval arrest of brap-2 mutant animals to oxidative stress requires a functional brc-1 allele, which is responsible for an increase in the expression levels of the cell cycle inhibitor cki-1. BRCA1 is necessary for DNA damage repair and maintaining genomic integrity, a function that is conserved with the BRC-1 homolog in C. elegans. In mammals, genomic instability due to the absence of BRCA1 function blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. There are a number of distinct pathways that influence the cell cycle that involves BRCA1-interacting proteins such as ATM, BARD1, Rb, p53, and p21WAF1/CIP1. In C. elegans, we show here that BRC-1 does play a role in cell cycle progression by regulating the p21 ortholog cki-1, at least in the context of oxidative stress response during development, although in this case, the pathway does not require the Rb and p53 homologs lin-35 and cep-1. Mammalian Brap2 is postulated to function as a cytoplasmic retention protein for BRCA1, p21, and Cdc14 (11Li S. Ku C.Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.S. Chen C.F. Lee W.H. J. Biol.

Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It contains a H2-RING finger and functions as an E3 ligase capable of ubiquitinating itself, allowing for redistribution of associated proteins to other locations within the cell, such as the nucleus, upon the proteasomal degradation of Brap2 (12Matheny S.A. Chen C. Kortum R.L. Razidlo G.L. Lewis R.E. White M.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26.Kipreos, E.

Genesis. 2004; 38: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The C. elegans BRAP-2 contains all of the currently recognizable domains of the mammalian form and would appear likely to fulfill the same cellular function as a cytoplasmic retention protein for BRC-1 and/or CKI-1 and prevent its inappropriate activation in the presence of lower levels of reactive oxygen species. However, during our studies, we were unable to detect any direct interaction between BRAP-2 and BRC-1 or CKI-1. With respect to the mammalian BRCA1, the site of Brap2 interaction to BRCA1 was mapped to a region found in exon 11 (11Li S. Ku C.Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.S. Chen C.F. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which is present in a specific splicing variant of BRCA1. The brc-1 gene in C. elegans has no region that demonstrates homology with this exon (8Boulton S.J. Martin J.S. Polanowska J. Hill D.E. Gartner A. Vidal M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 33-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, although BRC-1 and BRAP-2 in C. elegans function genetically in a pathway responsible for oxidative stress response, the direct physical interaction between these two proteins does not appear to be conserved. Furthermore, the increase in cki-1 activity in brap-2 mutants appears to occur at the transcriptional level and not due to a direct physical interaction between these two proteins. We cannot rule out that other BRAP-2-interacting proteins may be required for the sensitivity to oxidative stress displayed by brap-2 minus worms. The mammalian Brap2 has been shown to interact with other cell cycle-regulating proteins, such as Cdc14. Interaction of BRAP-2 with the C. elegans homologs of Cdc14 has not yet been demonstrated, but it is possible that there is a coordinated response to enhanced oxidative species controlled by BRAP-2 to prevent progression of cell cycle than just the activation of BRC-1 to increase CKI-1 levels. Because Brap2 has also been postulated to be a negative regulator of the Ras signaling pathway, it is possible that Brap2 mediates Ras signaling to BRCA1. Ras has been shown to be important in ROS-signaling pathways through the RTK adaptor Shc (28Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). There are three Ras homologs in C. elegans; the most well known gene is let-60, which has a well defined role in cell fate decisions of the vulva precursor cells (29.Sundaram, M. V., (2006) WormBook (The C. elegans Research Community, ed.) http://www.wormbook.org, 10.1895/wormbook.1.80.1.Google Scholar). We tested brap-2 to determine whether it is involved in the let-60 signaling pathway by creating a double mutant with brap-2 deleted in the let-60(gf) background but saw no increase in the number of multivulva animals. We also tested let-60(gf) for oxidative sensitivity by incubating these animals on paraquat plates but only a slight sensitivity toward oxidative stress during development was apparent. These results suggest that brap-2 is neither a negative regulator of the LET-60 signaling pathway, nor is LET-60 essential in oxidative stress response. However, we have yet to test the other two Ras homologs in C. elegans (ras-1 and ras-2) for oxidative stress sensitivity, so a role of BRAP-2 in Ras signaling cannot be dismissed. In conclusion, we found that the C. elegans Brap2 homolog is hypersensitive to paraquat during development that leads to an increase in gene expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor cki-1 in blast/seam cells. The larval arrest of brap-2 mutant animals to oxidative stress specifically requires a wild-type brc-1 allele, which is responsible for the increase in the expression levels of cki-1. Therefore, BRAP-2 is necessary to prevent the aberrant induction of the BRC-1/CKI-1 signaling network caused by excessive ROS and indicates that BRAP-2 is required for cells to tolerate enhanced amounts of ROS. If this function is conserved in mammals, Brap2 may prevent cell cycle arrest and cell death due to excessive production of ROS.
