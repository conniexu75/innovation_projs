Thus, excitation of chlorophyll a form ""chlorophyll a 670"" can supplement, in these algae, the excitation of the form ""chlorophyll a 680-700."" The effect of the auxiliary pigments in these algae may be mediated by energy transfer to ""chlorophyll a 670."""

https://openalex.org/W2065087400,"APPROXIMATELY 95 per cent of the plasma copper in both mouse and man is normally present as a moiety of ceruloplasmin1. Ceruloplasmin, an α-globulin containing 0.34 per cent copper, exhibits oxidase activity in vitro with a variety of substrates2 and reversibly releases at least half its copper upon reduction3. Whether ceruloplasmin plays a part in the transport of copper or acts as an oxidase in vivo, however, is not known. In the work reported here, the function of ceruloplasmin in mice was investigated by determining the rate of exchange of its copper moiety."

https://openalex.org/W2014800243,Bipolar electrodes were implanted in large goldfish in olfactory and nonolfactory areas of the central nervous system. Stimulation of olfactory areas elicited stereotyped feeding activity indistinguishable from normally induced behavior. It is suggested that the olfactory rather than the peripheral gustatory system plays the predominant role in the arousal of feeding activity.

When such preparations were tested for phosphohexoisomerase activity (4), sufficient enzyme was found to cause complete equi- libration in 30 minutes. It therefore appears likely that the higher activities with glucose-6-P resulted from its ability to protect the aminotransferase from inactivation during short time required before sufficient glucose-6-P was formed from fruc- tose-6-P when the latter was used as substrate. Presumably fructose-6-P affords little or no protection. Experiments with galactose-6-P support this hypothesis. Thus, with an enzyme preparation with a fructose-6-P to glucose-6-P ratio of 0.5, addi- tion of galactose-6-P (40 mM) had no effect on hexosamine for- mation from glucose-6-P but raised that from fructose-6-P to the glucose-6-P level. In the presence of only galactose-6-P plus glutamine, the enzyme system formed negligible hexosamine in this experiment. It has not been shown whether the protective effect of galactose-6-P is due to this ester itself or the small amounts of glucose-6-P present in the preparations (>2% by measurement with glucose-6-P dehydrogenase). The small quantities of hexosamine which were formed from galactose-6-P were shown to be glucosamine-6-P, and most likely were formed from the glucose-6-P in preparation. Nature of Glucose-6-P-protective Inactivation-Our evidence in- dicates that inactivation of the aminotransferase by liver ex- tracts, which is inhibited by glucose-6-P, enzymatic. The degree of inactivation increased with time of incubation and, since the aminotransferase activity of Fraction A was found to be stable at 38”, this inactivation could not have been due to heat denaturation. If rat liver was frozen immediately on Dry- Ice before homogenization and centrifugation, only small traces of aminotransferase activity were found in the 18,000 X g super- natant, even with glucose-6-P present during the procedure (Table V). Presumably the freezing and thawing process re- leased some inactivating agent. It was possible to determine the intracellular localization of inactivators with the use of Frac- tion A as the aminotransferase and a homogenate of unfrozen liver as the source of the inactivators. The results in Fig. 2 show that inactivation of the aminotransferase occurred upon “prein- cubation” with either the 2,000"

When further fractionated by acetone and ammonium sulfate this flagellate yields a c-type cytochrome. By similar extraction of dark-grown, nonphotosynthetic Euglena, another c-type cytochrome can be isolated. The cytochrome from the light-grown Euglena- is like that of cytochrome c isolated from a photosynthetic bacterium.

https://openalex.org/W2051624348,"IN a screening programme for antibiotic effects of Basidiomycetes we found a strain which inhibited Candida albicans. The antifungal substance was produced by this strain in surface and submerged culture in a medium containing peptone, glucose, inorganic salts and aneurin. The substance for which we provisionally propose the name ‘antibiotic-T’ was easily extracted from the fermentation liquor by most of the usual solvents. After extraction with benzene and evaporation of the solvent the residue became crystalline within a few days. Recrystallization twice from methyl alcohol gave pure crystals (prisms), melting point 126°C.,[α]D 20 + 13.5°, c. 1 in chloroform. No ultra-violet absorption characteristic of antifungal antibiotics of the polyene type was found. The antibiotic contains no halogen, sulphur or nitrogen. Micro-analyses: found (per cent): carbon, 68.51; hydrogen, 7.6; and oxygen, 25.0. The substance is very slightly soluble in hot water and gives a neutral solution; it is soluble in alcohols and sunflower oil and readily soluble in non-polar solvents. Its solution in water is stable for two months, is thermo-stable at its boiling point, but is inactivated at pH 12 within a few hours."

https://openalex.org/W2002605965,"WE have become interested in the possibility of extending the theory of ageing by interpreting age changes in performance within the framework of general behaviour theory. It seems to us that the Hullian concept of ‘reactive inhibition’1 might be particularly useful in this respect in that the assumption that reactive inhibition is generated more rapidly and dissipated more slowly as the age of an organism increases is compatible with many of the accepted changes which occur with age, and leads to predictions regarding changes which as yet have not been observed."
https://openalex.org/W2002357819,"THE observation that the usual appearance of the Marchi stage of Wallerian, nerve fibre degeneration in experimental material is strikingly altered by cortisone acetate (Pfizer, Ltd.) led us to try to discover whether cortisone would also alter in any way the effects of triorthocresyl phosphate poisoning, which are usually most apparent in the myelin sheaths of nerve fibres. Our results so far seem encouraging. A single application of triorthocresyl phosphate painted on the combs of hens (the dose being 0.1 c.c. per kgm. body-weight) invariably causes general symptoms of intoxication and paralysis in the legs after 8–25 days1. The administration of 25 mgm. of cortisone by mouth three days before the application of triorthocresyl phosphate and further doses of 25 mgm. every third day thereafter in all cases prevented the onset of paralysis and reduced the other general symptoms. Even if the administration of cortisone was delayed until the hens were severely stricken by the poison, its beneficial effects were still apparent, for the general condition of the birds rapidly improved, they began to feed avidly, and the paralysis was reduced to a mild state of postural imbalance. Similar results were obtained if the dose of triorthocresyl phosphate was increased to 0.15 c.c./kgm."

https://openalex.org/W1525360182,"ABS>The ash of egg shells from White Leghorn hens fed ration contains 0.049 plus or minus 0.020% strontium and the ash of bones of chicks contains 0.040 plus or minus 0.012%. When these hens are fed the same breeder ration with 0.2% strontium added, the contentration of strontium in the ash of the egg shells increases by a factor of 40 to 50 within 3 days, but no further increase occurs after that time. During the posttreatment period, the hens release some of the body stores of strontium to the eggs. After 50 days, the strontium content of the eggs decreases to approximately 2.5 times the natural level. Chicks hatched from eggs containing large amounts of strontium are able to metabolize appreciable amounts of this element. However, the strontium content of the ash of chick bones decreases to the natural level in 2 months or less because of elimination and dilution caused by rapid growth. Strontium to calcium ratios, calculated from approximate calcium percentages, indicate that there is no discrimination against strontium between the feed and the hen's eggs. The chick embryo shows some selectivity for strontium relative to calcium. (auth)"
