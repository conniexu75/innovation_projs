https://openalex.org/W2126642279,"Abstract Although classically studied as regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are highly expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the adult nervous system. We have begun investigating the potential role of MAPKs in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in mature neurons. In particular, we have studied the regulation of two MAPK isoforms, p44 and p42 MAPK, in hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP), a system widely studied as a model for the cellular basis of learning and memory. We have found that p42 MAPK, but not p44 MAPK, is activated in area CA1 following direct stimulation of two required components of the LTP induction cascades: protein kinase C and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that p42 MAPK, but not p44 MAPK, is activated in area CA1 in response to LTP-inducing high frequency stimulation and that this activation requires NMDA receptor stimulation. These data demonstrate that p42 MAPK can be regulated in an activity-dependent manner in the hippocampus and identify it as a potential component of the LTP induction cascades in area CA1. Such observations suggest that p42 MAPK might be an important regulator of synaptic plasticity in post-mitotic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2063574029,"We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel isoform of the sulfonylurea receptor from a mouse heart cDNA library. Coexpression of this isoform and BIR (Kir6.2) in a mammalian cell line elicited ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel currents. The channel was effectively activated by both diazoxide and pinacidil, which is the feature of smooth muscle KATP channels. Sequence analysis indicated that this clone is a variant of cardiac type sulfonylurea receptor (SUR2). The 42 amino acid residues located in the carboxyl-terminal end of this novel sulfonylurea receptor is, however, divergent from that of SUR2 but highly homologous to that of the pancreatic one (SUR1). Therefore, this short part of the carboxyl terminus may be important for diazoxide activation of KATP channels. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that mRNA of this clone was ubiquitously expressed in diverse tissues, including brain, heart, liver, urinary bladder, and skeletal muscle. These results suggest that this novel isoform of sulfonylurea receptor is a subunit reconstituting the smooth muscle KATP channel.

These KATP channels have been associated with diverse cellular functions, such as shortening of action potential duration and cellular loss of K+ ions that occur during metabolic inhibition in heart, insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, smooth muscle relaxation, regulation of skeletal muscle excitability, and neurotransmitter release (5Terzic A.

Furthermore, KATP channels in different tissues exhibit considerable variation in response to K+ channel openers. For example, the pancreatic β-cell KATP channel is activated by diazoxide and only weakly by pinacidil. The cardiac KATP channel is activated by pinacidil but not by diazoxide. The smooth muscle KATP channel is activated effectively by both of these compounds (2Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signalling. 1990; 2: 197-214Google Scholar, 5Terzic A. Jahangir A. Kurachi Y.

Thus, properties of KATP channels vary among tissues, having led to the premise that this K+ channel family may be composed of heterogeneous K+ channel proteins.Recently, it has been shown that the pancreatic β-cell KATP channel is a complex composed of at least two subunits, a K+ channel subunit (BIR/Kir6.2) and the pancreatic sulfonylurea receptor, SUR1 (7Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement IV, J.P. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Google Scholar, 8Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Google Scholar). Coexpression of these two subunits reconstituted inwardly rectifying ATP-sensitive K+ conductance (IK.ATP), which was inhibited by sulfonylureas and activated by diazoxide. It was also reported that coexpression of BIR and an isoform of SUR isolated from a rat brain cDNA library, designated SUR2, elicited IK.ATP, which was activated by pinacidil and cromakalim but not by diazoxide (9Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Wang C.-Z. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Google Scholar). SUR2 mRNA was expressed at high levels in heart and skeletal muscle as assessed by Northern blot analysis. Thus, the complex of BIR and SUR2 may reconstitute KATP channels described in heart and skeletal muscle. The finding that distinct SURs produce different responses of the reconstituted IK.ATP to K+ channel openers suggests the existence of other isoforms of SURs that could be responsible for the smooth muscle type of response of IK.ATP.In this study, we have tried to find SURs by screening a mouse heart cDNA library and obtained a novel isoform. Coexpression of BIR and this novel SUR reconstituted IK.ATP activated by both pinacidil and diazoxide. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that mRNA for this SUR was expressed in various tissues, including brain, heart, lung, liver, urinary bladder, and skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that this novel SUR is a subunit that could represent part of the smooth muscle KATP channel.RESULTSWe obtained 49 positive clones after screening approximately 6 × 105 plaques of the mouse heart cDNA library. Two of these clones, named MCS3 and MCS10, were further analyzed by sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of MCS10 revealed a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 1546 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequence of MCS10 had 67% identity with that of rat SUR1 (7Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement IV, J.P. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Google Scholar) and 97% identity with that of rat SUR2 (9Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Wang C.-Z. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Google Scholar), indicating that MCS10 is homologous to SUR2. The hydropathy profile of MCS10 was similar to those of SUR1 and SUR2, suggesting that this clone has a similar topology with 13 putative transmembrane regions and the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions located extracellularly and intracellularly, respectively. MCS10 had two potential nucleotide binding folds with Walker A and B consensus motifs (11Sakura H. Ämmälä C. Smith P.A. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 338-344Google Scholar), two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation sites.The screening of a rat brain cDNA library with mouse uKATP-1 as a probe resulted in isolation of one clone, of which nucleotide sequencing revealed a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 390 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of this clone was 99% identical to that of mouse (m-)BIR (8Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Google Scholar), indicating that it is rat (r-)BIR. Three amino acid residues of r-BIR were divergent from those of m-BIR; Thr22, Ser248, and Val337 in r-BIR and Ala22, Gly248, and Ile337 in m-BIR. In r-BIR, Lys379 was inserted between the codons for Ala378 and Pro379 in m-BIR.By using patch clamp technique, we analyzed the channels expressed in HEK 293T cells cotransfected with MCS10 and r-BIR (Fig. 2). In the cell-attached configuration, unitary currents of ~−5 pA at −60 mV occasionally appeared in bursts in the cotransfected cells. Diazoxide (200 μM) or pinacidil (100 μM) added to the bathing solution markedly increased the channel activity as shown in Fig. 2A, a; diazoxide and pinacidil increased the mean channel current amplitude by ~17 and ~27 times, respectively, in this particular cell-attached patch where such a large number of channels were activated that individual single channel current levels could not be distinguished. Such responses to the K+ channel openers were not observed in the cells transfected with either MCS10 or r-BIR alone (not shown). Both diazoxide- and pinacidil-induced channel activity were inhibited by tolbutamide or glibenclamide, specific blockers of KATP channels (Fig. 2A, a). On patch excision, maximal channel activity appeared promptly and was almost completely inhibited by 1 mM of intracellular MgATP. Similar data were obtained from five other patches in the cotransfected cells. Spontaneous openings of the MCS10/r-BIR channels in the inside-out patches rapidly ran down in the presence of 100 μM intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2A, b). The channel could be easily reactivated after treating the patch with 1 mM MgATP. MgUDP (10 mM) restored the channel activity after run-down (Fig. 2A, b). Single channel recordings of the MCS10/r-BIR channels in a cell-attached patch are shown in Fig. 2B. The channels opened in bursts at all membrane potentials examined. The currents flowing through the channels reversed around 0 mV under the symmetrical K+ solutions (Fig. 2B, a). The current-voltage relationship demonstrated weak inward rectification with the single channel conductance of 80.3 pS between −100 and −20 mV (Fib. 2B, b).Fig. 2Pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of MCS10/r-BIR channels expressed in HEK 293T cells. MCS10 and r-BIR were heterologously expressed in HEK 293T cells and analyzed in the cell-attached and inside-out configurations of the patch clamp technique. The pipette solution contained ~145 mM K+, whereas the bath was perfused with the internal solution which contained ~145 mM K+.

Open and filled circles are the plots against the total ATP concentrations, whereas open diamonds are the estimated concentrations of ATP not complexed with Mg2+ in this solution. D, concentration-dependent restoration of the MCS10/r-BIR channels by intracellular UDP after run-down by Ca2+ as in A, b. a, various concentrations of UDP was applied to the intracellular surface of an inside-out patch membrane. The membrane potential was −60 mV. b, the concentration-response relationship. The number of observations at each point was three. The data at each concentration of UDP were expressed as percentages of the value in the presence of 1 mM UDP, which always gave the maximum activation. Symbols and bars indicate the means ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Intracellular ATP inhibited the channel openings in a concentration-dependent manner in both the absence and the presence of intracellular Mg2+ (Fig. 2C, a). The concentration-response relationships could be fitted with the following Hill equation: %Inhibitation=100/1+ATP/Kdn(Eq. 1) where [ATP] is the concentration of ATP, Kd is the apparent dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient (Fig. 2C, b). The Kd and n were estimated as 67.9 μM and 1.85 for Mg2+-free ATP (Fig. 2C, b, closed circles), and 300 μM and 1.43 for MgATP (Fig. 2C, b, open circles), respectively. When the inhibition evoked by MgATP was replotted by calculating the concentration of ATP not complexed with Mg2+ in this solution (Fig. 2C, b, open diamonds), the apparent Kd was estimated as 16.9 μM. This value was lower than that found in the absence of Mg2+ (67.9 μM). Therefore, these results indicate that both Mg2+-free ATP and MgATP can inhibit the channel openings.Intracellular UDP restored the channel openings after run-down of the expressed channel in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2D, a). The concentration-response relationship could be fitted with the following Hill equation: Relative activation=1001+Kd/UDPn(Eq. 2) where [UDP] is the concentration of UDP. The Kd and n were estimated as 71.7 μM and 1.74, respectively. Thus, UDP may activate this channel in a positive cooperative manner.The sequence analysis of another clone obtained, MCS3, showed that this clone was essentially the same as rat SUR2. MCS3, which lacked 5′-untranslated and coding regions, has a sequence identical to MCS10 and possessed an additional 176-bp insertion in the COOH terminus between nucleotide positions 4505 and 4506 of MCS10. The insertion of these 176 bp generated divergent amino acid sequences in the COOH termini between MCS3 and MCS10 (Fig. 3A). Thus, MCS3 had an amino acid sequence identical to MCS10 through Val1504 and then diverged in the COOH-terminal ends. These findings indicated that MCS10 and MCS3 may be formed by alternative splicing of a single mouse gene. A comparison of amino acid sequences in the COOH termini of MCS10, MCS3, r-SUR1, and r-SUR2 is shown in Fig. 3B. The amino acid sequence of MCS3 was identical to that of r-SUR2 except for one amino acid residue (Val1508 in MCS3 and Met1507 in r-SUR2), suggesting that MCS3 is a mouse homolog of r-SUR2. Based on these results, we designated r-SUR2, MCS3, and MCS10 as r-SUR2A, m-SUR2A, and m-SUR2B, respectively. For the alternative regions composed of 42 amino acid residues located in the ends of their sequences, m-SUR2B showed 74% identity with r-SUR1 and 33% identity with m-SUR2A.Fig. 3The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences in the 3′ ends of SURs.

The specific primers for amplification of both m-SUR2A and m-SUR2B were designed to produce cDNA fragments of 555 and 379 bp, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, m-SUR2A mRNA was expressed in cerebellum, eye, atrium, ventricle, urinary bladder, and skeletal muscle. The m-SUR2B mRNA distributed not only in these tissues but in all other tissues examined: forebrain, lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, stomach, small intestine, colon, uterus, ovary, and fat tissue.Fig. 4RT-PCR detection of m-SUR2A and m-SUR2B. The RT-PCR assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The RT-PCR yielded visible amplified product (555 bp) of m-SUR2A in mRNA of cerebellum, eye, atrium, ventricle, urinary bladder, and skeletal muscle, and that (379 bp) of m-SUR2B in mRNA of all tissues examined in this study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONRecent studies have shown that coexpression of SUR (SUR1 or SUR2A) and BIR reconstitutes IK.ATP, but neither of them can express the channel activity on their own (7Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement IV, J.P. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Google Scholar, 8Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P.

Proks P. Smith P.A. Sakura H. Coles B. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 545-548Google Scholar). Likewise, SUR2B only when cotransfected with BIR produced KATP channel activity. In this study, BIR was used to provide the gating part of KATP channels. However, it has also been shown that Kir clones other than BIR, such as ROMK1 (Kir1.1) and uKATP-1 (Kir6.1) can interact with SUR (12Ämmälä C. Moorhouse A. Gribble F. Ashfield R. Proks P. Smith P.A. Sakura H. Coles B. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 545-548Google Scholar). These Kir clones produce K+ channel activity for themselves but become sensitive to glibenclamide when the SUR1 clone is cotransfected. Therefore, SUR2B may also be able to couple to several types of Kir clones and either produce KATP channel activity and/or induce glibenclamide sensitivity. This might be the mechanism responsible for the reported diversity of the gating and conductance properties of smooth muscle KATP channels (4Standen N.B. Quayle J.M. Davis N.W. Brayden J.E. Huang Y. Nelson M.T. Science. 1989; 245: 177-180Google Scholar, 13Kajioka S. Kitamura K. Kuriyama H. J. Physiol. 1991; 444: 397-418Google Scholar, 14Beech D.J. Zhang H. Nakao K. Bolton T.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 573-582Google Scholar).KATP channels in different tissues exhibit distinct responses to K+ channel openers. The hamster SUR1/m-BIR channel, expressed in COS-1 or HEK 293 cells, is inhibited by 0.1 μM glibenclamide or 500 μM tolbutamide and activated by 100 μM diazoxide (8Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Google Scholar, 11Sakura H. Ämmälä C. Smith P.A. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 338-344Google Scholar). These properties are characteristic of pancreatic β-cell KATP channels (15Cook D.L. Hales C.N. Nature. 1984; 311: 271-273Google Scholar, 16Findlay I. Dunne M.J. Petersen O.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 88: 165-172Google Scholar). In contrast, the r-SUR2A/m-BIR channel requires a high concentration (1 μM) of glibenclamide for inhibition and is activated by pinacidil but not by diazoxide. These are the features of cardiac and skeletal muscle KATP channels (5Terzic A. Jahangir A. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C525-C545Google Scholar, 17Faivre J.F. Findlay I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 984: 1-5Google Scholar, 18Findlay I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 261: 540-545Google Scholar). Thus, SUR would appear to be the major determinant of the pharmacological properties of KATP channels. Because the m-SUR2B/r-BIR channel was activated by both pinacidil and diazoxide, SUR2B corresponds to the smooth muscle KATP response (4Standen N.B. Quayle J.M. Davis N.W. Brayden J.E. Huang Y. Nelson M.T. Science. 1989; 245: 177-180Google Scholar, 13Kajioka S. Kitamura K. Kuriyama H. J. Physiol. 1991; 444: 397-418Google Scholar, 14Beech D.J. Zhang H. Nakao K. Bolton T.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 573-582Google Scholar). The ubiquitous expression of SUR2B mRNA in all of the tissues that we have tested is consistent with the notion that SUR2B is a subunit of the smooth muscle KATP channel.We have identified two mouse homologs of the second class of SUR, designated m-SUR2A and m-SUR2B. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of these isoforms showed that the molecular diversity of SUR2 transcripts may be due to alternative splicing at the 3′ end. An additional nucleotides of 176 bp specific for m-SUR2A in 3′-coding region generated divergent transcripts in the COOH termini. Comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences in the COOH termini (Fig. 3) showed that m-SUR2A and m-SUR2B are highly homologous to r-SUR2A and r-SUR1, respectively. Because diazoxide activated KATP channels reconstituted from SUR1 or SUR2B but not from SUR2A, this alternative COOH-terminal end may be the functional domain important for diazoxide activation of KATP channels. On the other hand, binding sites of pinacidil to SURs may be in the regions different from the COOH-terminal end, because pinacidil activated KATP channels reconstituted from SUR2A or SUR2B but not from SUR1.In conclusion, our results indicate that SUR2B forms with BIR a KATP channel with a pharmacology representative of smooth muscle, whereas SUR1/BIR and SUR2A/BIR channels form pancreatic and cardiac types, respectively. The successful cloning of this novel SUR should open a novel approach to elucidate the molecular mechanism of smooth muscle regulation and also to develop new vasorelaxants belonging to K+ channel openers.

These findings suggest that this novel SUR is a subunit that could represent part of the smooth muscle KATP channel."

The product of this cDNA adds hydroxyl groups to both β rings of the symmetrical β-carotene (β,β-carotene) to form zeaxanthin (β,β-carotene-3,3′-diol) and converts the monocyclic β-zeacarotene (7′,8′-dihydro-β,ψ-carotene) to hydroxy-β-zeacarotene (7′,8′-dihydro-β,ψ-carotene-3-ol). The ϵ rings of δ-carotene (ϵ,ψ-carotene) and α-zeacarotene (7′,8′-dihydro-ϵ,ψ-carotene) are poor substrates for the enzyme. The predicted amino acid sequence of the A. thaliana enzyme resembles the four known bacterial β-carotene hydroxylase enzymes (31-37% identity) but is much longer, with an N-terminal extension of more than 130 amino acids. Truncation of the cDNA to produce a polypeptide lacking the first 69 amino acids does not impair enzyme activity in E. coli. Truncation to yield a polypeptide of a length comparable with the bacterial enzymes (lacking 129 N-terminal amino acids) resulted in the accumulation of the monohydroxy intermediate β-cryptoxanthin (β,β-carotene-3-ol), predominantly, when β-carotene was provided as the substrate.

https://openalex.org/W1965619464,"Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are essential for pre-mRNA splicing, and modify the choice of splice site during alternative splicing in a process apparently regulated by protein phosphorylation. Two protein kinases have been cloned that can phosphorylate SR proteins in vitro: SRPK1 and Clk/Sty. Here, we show that these two kinases phosphorylate the same SR proteins in vitro, but that SRPK1 has the higher specific activity toward ASF/SF2. SRPK1, like Clk/Sty, phosphorylates ASF/SF2 in vitro on sites that are also phosphorylated in vivo. Tryptic peptide mapping of ASF/SF2 revealed that three of the phosphopeptides from full-length ASF/SF2 phosphorylated in vitro contain consecutive phosphoserine-arginine residues or phosphoserine-proline residues. In vitro, the Clk/Sty kinase phosphorylated Ser-Arg, Ser-Lys, or Ser-Pro sites, whereas SRPK1 had a strong preference for Ser-Arg sites. These results suggest that SRPK1 and Clk/Sty may play different roles in regulating SR splicing factors, and suggest that Clk/Sty has a broader substrate specificity than SRPK1.

https://openalex.org/W1964451895,"We have isolated a high copy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutation in ATM1, which codes for an ABC transporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria. The suppressor, termed BAT1, encodes a protein of 393 amino acid residues with an NH2-terminal extension that directs Bat1p to the mitochondrial matrix. A highly homologous protein, Bat2p, of 376 amino acid residues was found in the cytosol. Both Bat proteins show striking similarity to the mammalian protein Eca39, which is one of the few known targets of the myc oncogene. Deletion of a single BAT gene did not impair growth of yeast cells. In contrast, deletion of both genes resulted in an auxotrophy for branched-chain amino acids (Ile, Leu, and Val) and in a severe growth reduction on glucose-containing media, even after supply of these amino acids. Mitochondria and cytosol isolated from bat1 and bat2 deletion mutants, respectively, contained largely reduced activities for the conversion of branched-chain 2-ketoacids to their corresponding amino acids. Thus, the Bat proteins represent the first known isoforms of yeast branched-chain amino acid transaminases. The severe growth defect of the double deletion mutant observed even in the presence of branched-chain amino acids suggests that the Bat proteins, in addition to the supply of these amino acids, perform another important function in the cell.

INTRODUCTIONAtm1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the first known ABC transporter of the mitochondrial inner membrane (1Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Google Scholar). 1G. Kispal, B. Guiard, and R. Lill, submitted for publication. Yeast cells with inactivated Atm1p display a drastic reduction in growth on fermentable carbon sources such as glucose and do not grow on nonfermentable carbon sources such as glycerol. In the absence of functional Atm1p, yeast cells exhibit a general deficiency in heme-containing proteins, e.g. cytochromes in mitochondria and catalase in peroxisomes.1 At present, the natural substrate of Atm1p is not known. Heme has been ruled out as a potential substrate, since normal growth of yeast cells lacking Atm1p cannot be restored by the addition of heme (1Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Google Scholar). A further phenotypical hallmark of atm1 deletion cells is the accumulation of iron in mitochondria.1 This excludes iron as the compound transported by Atm1p but suggests that the protein plays an indirect role in iron metabolism.In order to elucidate the functional role of Atm1p, we considered it important to identify proteins interacting with the transporter. Therefore, we screened for high copy suppressors of a temperature-sensitive mutation in ATM1. The mutant cells (strain R64a) contain an Atm1p transporter, which, at the nonpermissive temperature, is degraded. 2G. Kispal, unpublished observations. As a result, mutant cells do not grow on nonfermentable carbon sources such as glycerol. Here, we describe the isolation of a suppressor termed BAT1. The encoded protein, Bat1p, is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, and, at increased concentrations, it can prevent the degradation of the mutated Atm1p, thus allowing growth at the nonpermissive temperature.Based on the immunological cross-reactivity, we isolated a highly homologous protein termed Bat2p, which is localized in the cytosol. Both Bat proteins display a striking sequence similarity to the mammalian protein Eca39. This protein was originally identified by the high overexpression of its mRNA in an undifferentiated mouse teratocarcinoma cell line (3Niwa Q. Kumazaki T. Tsukiyama T. Soma G. Miyajima N. Yokoro K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6709Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was reported that its gene is induced by overexpression of the protooncogene c-myc (4Benvenisty N. Leder A. Kuo A. Leder P. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2513-2523Google Scholar). Homologs of this murine protein are known in humans, rats, and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We now identify the two Bat proteins as the yeast branched-chain amino acid transaminases, enzymes that until now have escaped a genetic identification (see 5Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N.

The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Vol II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 319Google Scholar). Several criteria, including the slow growth of the double mutant in the presence of branched-chain amino acids, suggest that the Bat proteins, besides supplying the cell with these amino acids, are required for another important process.DISCUSSIONOur study identifies the first two yeast proteins known to function as branched-chain amino acid transaminases. The two enzymes are localized within different subcellular compartments, namely the mitochondria and the cytosol. Thus, the last step in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (5Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 181Google Scholar, 6Hinnebusch A.G. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Vol II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 319Google Scholar) can be performed either within mitochondria, where the initial irreversible steps of the synthesis occur, or they may take place after the exit of the 2-ketoacids into the cytosol. Obviously, a carrier in the mitochondrial inner membrane can equilibrate the mitochondrial and cytosolic pools of branched-chain 2-ketoacids and their corresponding amino acids, since the deletion of a single BAT gene results in no severe phenotype. From our data it appears rather unlikely that the Bat proteins themselves constitute the carrier, as has been suggested for the mitochondrial branched-chain amino acid transferase from rat heart (37Hutson S.M. Hall T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3084-3091Google Scholar). In yeast, both Bat proteins appear to be soluble proteins. Our findings also explain why these enzymes have escaped previous genetic identification. Deletion of only one of the BAT genes did not result in an auxotrophy for branched-chain amino acids. Although the two Bat proteins perform largely overlapping functions, the slight growth defect of Δbat1 cells on glycerol-containing rich medium (YPG; Table I) suggests that the individual Bat proteins may also perform more specialized roles in the cell.A limited sequence similarity exists between the two yeast Bat proteins and the branched-chain amino acid transaminase IlvE of E. coli. The lysyl residue 159 of IlvE known to form the Schiff base intermediate with pyridoxal phosphate during the transamination reaction (29Inoue K. Kuramitsu S. Aki K. Watanabe Y. Takagi T. Nishigai M. Ikai A. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 777-784Google Scholar) is conserved in all the proteins sharing homology with Bat1p (Fig. 2, outlined). Most likely, all of these Bat protein homologs perform a function as branched-chain amino acid transaminases and use this lysine during the catalytic process for the interaction with the coenzyme. This expectation is supported by the recent cloning of the cytosolic isoform of the rat branched-chain aminotransferase, BCATc, which shows significant homology to the Bat proteins (26Hutson S.M. Bledsoe R.K. Hall T.R. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30344-30352Google Scholar). Interestingly, a threonyl residue in E. coli IlvE (position 156) thought to be involved in forming a hydrogen bond with the phosphate group of the coenzyme (29Inoue K. Kuramitsu S. Aki K. Watanabe Y. Takagi T. Nishigai M. Ikai A. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 777-784Google Scholar) is not present in this region of the two Bat proteins. Thus, the importance of this hydrogen bonding for the enzymatic process appears to be limited. In contrast to the E. coli protein, the homolog from the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis, YwaA, shows high sequence similarity to the Bat proteins. Presumably, this protein also functions as a branched-chain amino acid transaminase. It will therefore be interesting to learn whether Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria contain different subtypes of these enzymes.The function of the other Bat homologs as transaminases should now be testable by using yeast as a model organism (38Oliver S.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 597-600Google Scholar). If functional as a transaminase, all of the homologs should be able to complement the growth defects of Δbat1Δbat2 cells on glucose-containing media. This analysis will be especially important for the mouse Eca39 protein, which has been reported to be regulated in its expression by the myc oncogene (4Benvenisty N. Leder A. Kuo A. Leder P. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2513-2523Google Scholar). The functional connection of the Eca39 proteins to the Myc protein is unclear. Expression of Myc is related to the recovery of cells from stationary phase (39Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Google Scholar, 40Västrik I. Mäkelä T.P. Koskinen P.J. Klefstrom J. Alitalo K. Crit. Rev. Oncogenet. 1994; 5: 59-68Google Scholar). We noticed that yeast cells deficient in a single Bat protein, despite displaying no obvious growth reduction, can only slowly leave stationary phase (data not shown). The Bat proteins may therefore perform a critical function in processes that are necessary for cells to leave the resting phase and to enter the cell cycle. It will be interesting to investigate whether an interaction of the Bat proteins with factors regulating these reactions in yeast can be detected.Several lines of evidence suggest that the function of the Bat proteins may not be restricted to the supply of branched-chain amino acids by the conversion from their corresponding 2-ketoacids. First of all, the strong growth defect of a Δbat1Δbat2 double deletion mutant cannot be explained by the impairment of the cellular branched-chain amino acid transaminase activity. Apparently, the biosynthetic function of the Bat proteins as branched-chain amino acid transaminases can be taken over by other enzymes in the cell, and only a 2-fold reduction in the transamination activity in the cytosol is seen in Δbat1Δbat2 cells. This notion is supported by our measurements of the cellular levels of free amino acids. They are close to wild-type levels and should sustain normal cell growth, even in the absence of the two Bat proteins. Furthermore, the strong growth defect observed with Δbat1Δbat2 cells on minimal media can only partially be suppressed by the addition of leucine, isoleucine, and valine (see Table I). Thus, in addition to their role in supplying the cell with branched-chain amino acids, the Bat proteins seem to fulfill an additional function that is important to maintain normal growth rates. Strikingly, an additional function has also been found for another enzyme of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis (41Zelenaya-Troitskaya O. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3268-3276Google Scholar). Deletion of ILV5, encoding the mitochondrial acetohydroxy acid reductoisomerase, resulted in unstable mitochondrial DNA producing mostly ρ− petite mutants. Two independent functions have also been observed for another pyridoxal phosphate-dependent protein, the bacterial NifS. Initially, NifS was shown to be a cysteine desulfurase required for the formation of the iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster in a subunit of nitrogenase (42Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Google Scholar, 43Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that these enzymes may also function as amino acid transaminases (44Leong-Morgenthaler P. Oliver S.G. Hottinger H. Soll D. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 45-49Google Scholar).What could be such an additional function of the Bat proteins? Hints to answer this fundamental question may come from the investigation of components interacting with the Bat proteins. We have isolated the BAT1 gene as a high copy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutation in ATM1 encoding a mitochondrial ABC transporter.1 High levels of Bat1p, but not of Bat2p, can stabilize the mutant Atm1p against degradation at the nonpermissive temperature. This suggests a direct protein-protein interaction as the molecular basis of the stabilizing effect rather than an indirect effect, e.g. by the interaction of a Bat1p metabolite with Atm1p. This is supported by the observation that overexpression of Bat2p does not suppress the temperature-sensitive mutation in ATM1 (not shown). A further strong indication for a direct functional relationship between Atm1p and Bat1p is the leucine auxotrophy associated with the deletion of the ATM1 gene.1What may be the functional connection between Bat1p and Atm1p? At present, the physiological substrate of Atm1p is unknown. Atm1p-deficient cells almost completely lack heme-containing proteins such as mitochondrial cytochromes and peroxisomal catalase,1 but heme has been excluded to be the substrate of the transporter (1Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Google Scholar). The accumulation of iron in atm1 mutant mitochondria suggests that the protein may be indirectly involved in mitochondrial iron metabolism.1 Iron, to be maintained in a soluble state within the cell, has to be complexed by chelating compounds (2Kaplan J. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1996; 271: 1510-1512Google Scholar, 45Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Google Scholar). Therefore, one possible scenario is that Atm1p actively transports an iron chelator between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol. If transport would occur toward the cytosol, this would result in low concentrations of the free chelator in the matrix. Iron would therefore be more easily available for incorporation into Fe/S proteins and the synthesis of heme. It seems possible, although not very likely, that the chelator is chemically identical to the substrates of the Bat transamination reaction, namely to the branched-chain 2-ketoacids or amino acids. Clearly, also from this point of view it will be important to identify the second cellular function of the Bat proteins. INTRODUCTIONAtm1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the first known ABC transporter of the mitochondrial inner membrane (1Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Google Scholar). 1G. Kispal, B. Guiard, and R. Lill, submitted for publication. Yeast cells with inactivated Atm1p display a drastic reduction in growth on fermentable carbon sources such as glucose and do not grow on nonfermentable carbon sources such as glycerol. In the absence of functional Atm1p, yeast cells exhibit a general deficiency in heme-containing proteins, e.g. cytochromes in mitochondria and catalase in peroxisomes.1 At present, the natural substrate of Atm1p is not known. Heme has been ruled out as a potential substrate, since normal growth of yeast cells lacking Atm1p cannot be restored by the addition of heme (1Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Google Scholar). A further phenotypical hallmark of atm1 deletion cells is the accumulation of iron in mitochondria.1 This excludes iron as the compound transported by Atm1p but suggests that the protein plays an indirect role in iron metabolism.In order to elucidate the functional role of Atm1p, we considered it important to identify proteins interacting with the transporter. Therefore, we screened for high copy suppressors of a temperature-sensitive mutation in ATM1. The mutant cells (strain R64a) contain an Atm1p transporter, which, at the nonpermissive temperature, is degraded. 2G. Kispal, unpublished observations. As a result, mutant cells do not grow on nonfermentable carbon sources such as glycerol. Here, we describe the isolation of a suppressor termed BAT1. The encoded protein, Bat1p, is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, and, at increased concentrations, it can prevent the degradation of the mutated Atm1p, thus allowing growth at the nonpermissive temperature.Based on the immunological cross-reactivity, we isolated a highly homologous protein termed Bat2p, which is localized in the cytosol. Both Bat proteins display a striking sequence similarity to the mammalian protein Eca39. This protein was originally identified by the high overexpression of its mRNA in an undifferentiated mouse teratocarcinoma cell line (3Niwa Q. Kumazaki T. Tsukiyama T. Soma G. Miyajima N. Yokoro K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6709Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was reported that its gene is induced by overexpression of the protooncogene c-myc (4Benvenisty N. Leder A. Kuo A. Leder P. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2513-2523Google Scholar). Homologs of this murine protein are known in humans, rats, and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We now identify the two Bat proteins as the yeast branched-chain amino acid transaminases, enzymes that until now have escaped a genetic identification (see 5Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N.

P-glycoprotein is a plasma membrane protein member of the “ABC transporters” (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily. This family includes among others the yeast mating pheromone exporter STE6, the mammalian cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, the multidrug resistance-associated protein, and the bacterial periplasmic proteins involved in amino acids, sugar, and oligopeptide transport (Hyde et al., 27Hyde S.

P-glycoprotein, encoded by the MDR-1 gene in humans, is associated with the resistance frequently developed by cancer cells to a wide variety of cytotoxic drugs used in cancer chemotherapy (Endicott and Ling, 14Endicott J. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Google Scholar; Chan et al., 7Chan H. Haddad G. Thorner P. DeBoer G. Lin Y. Ondrusek N. Yeger H. Ling V. N. Engl. J.

These hydrophobic drugs, such as Vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, and Taxol, enter cells by passive diffusion through the plasma membrane (Beck and Qian, 4Beck W. Qian X. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 89-93Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein is thought to mediate multidrug resistance by acting as an ATP-dependent drug pump with a broad specificity. It is able to transport drugs against a concentration gradient to the exterior of the cell (Chin et al., 10Chin K. Pastan I. Gottesman M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 157-180Google Scholar; Gottesman and Pastan, 23Gottesman M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar; Sharom et al., 1993; Ruetz and Gros, 30Ruetz S.

According to its amino acid sequence, P-glycoprotein consists of two homologous halves, each including a hydrophobic domain and a hydrophilic region containing the ATP binding domain. Little is known, however, about the structure of P-glycoprotein. Different topologies were derived from experimental studies or from sequence analysis (Chen et al., 8Chen C. Chin J. Ueda K. Clark D. Pastan I. Gottesman M. Robinson I. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Google Scholar; Gerlach et al., 15Gerlach J. Endicott J. Juranka P. Henderson G. Sarangi F. Deuchars K. Ling V.

P-glycoprotein was recently purified from multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary CHRB30 cells overexpressing the protein by a combination of anion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography (Shapiro and Ling, 32Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Google Scholar). The purified P-glycoprotein was reconstituted into liposomes where its ATPase activity and ATP-dependent transport properties were retained (Shapiro and Ling, 32Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Google Scholar, 33Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein displays an ATPase activity in the absence of any known transported molecule and binds MgADP and MgATP, although MgADP is not hydrolyzed (Urbatsch et al., 39Urbatsch I.L. Banumathi S. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Google Scholar a, 1995b). Hydrolysis of MgATP by P-glycoprotein is stimulated by some chemosensitizers such as verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, and a series of other drugs involved in multidrug resistance (Ambudkar et al., 3Ambudkar S. Lelong I. Zhang J. Cardarelli C. Gottesman M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8472-8476Google Scholar; Sarkadi et al., 31Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A.

Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Google Scholar). Among these molecules, verapamil induces the highest activation (Shapiro and Ling, 32Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Google Scholar). Stimulation of ATPase activity suggests that this molecule interacts directly with P-glycoprotein, but the mechanism of stimulation remains unclear. Verapamil, known to reverse drug resistance by inhibiting the efflux of antitumor agents is actively transported by P-glycoprotein (Tsuruo et al., 37Tsuruo T. Iida H. Tsukagoshi S. Sakurai Y. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1967-1972Google Scholar, 38Tsuruo T. Iida H. Tsukagashi S. Sakurai Y. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4730-4733Google Scholar; Yusa and Tsuruo, 42Yusa K. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5002-5006Google Scholar). Moreover, a verapamil photoaffinity analogue labels P-glycoprotein (Yusa and Tsuruo, 42Yusa K. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5002-5006Google Scholar). This evidence supports the hypothesis of a direct binding of verapamil to specific sites of P-glycoprotein. In this report, we describe the reconstitution of P-glycoprotein in asolectin vesicles and characterize the reconstituted system with respect to protein orientation, ATPase activity, and drug transport. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was then used to obtain a quantitative evaluation of the protein secondary structure. The effects of specific ligands, MgATP, MgADP, and verapamil, on the secondary structure of P-glycoprotein were also investigated.

Fractions containing lipids were detected by enzymatic colorimetric assay of the phosphatidylcholine (Boerhinger Mannheim) and fractions containing protein were detected by tryptophan fluorescence (λexc = 280 nm and λem = 330 nm) (Sonveaux et al., 36Sonveaux N.

After an appropriate time at 37°C, the vesicles were centrifuged on a 0.7 × 2-cm column of Sephadex G50 (fine) equilibrated with 50 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.4), 125 mM NaCl, 3 mM ATP, 6 mM MgCl2 to eliminate free daunomycin. 3 ml of scintillation fluid were added to the vesicles collected from the column and [3H]daunomycin uptake was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Association of daunomycin was also measured in the absence of MgATP. The ATP-dependent uptake was calculated by subtracting this uptake from that determined in the presence of ATP. Thin films were obtained by slowly evaporating the sample on one side of the ATR plate in a stream of nitrogen. The ATR plate was then sealed in a universal sample holder (Perkin-Elmer 186-0354). The internal reflection element (ATR) is a germanium plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm, Harrick EJ2121) with an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections (Goormaghtigh et al., 18Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Google Scholar). The sample on the ATR plate was hydrated by flushing D2O-saturated N2 for 2 h. The H/D exchange allows differentiation of the α-helical secondary structure from random secondary structure (Susi et al., 1967) whose absorption band shifts from about 1655 to about 1642 cm−1. Spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer infrared spectrophotometer FTIR 1720x equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The spectrophotometer was continuously purged with dry air. 128 scans were averaged for each measurement. The combination of resolution enhancement methods with a band fitting procedure allows the quantitative assessment of the protein secondary structures (α-helix, β-sheet, and unordered structures). These procedures have been described extensively earlier (Cabiaux et al., 5Cabiaux V. Brasseur R. Wattiez R. Falmagne P. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4928-4938Google Scholar; Goormaghtigh et al., 18Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Google Scholar, 21Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-450Google Scholar; Vigneron et al., 41Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17685-17696Google Scholar). Films containing 10-20 μg of protein were prepared on a germanium plate as described above. Nitrogen gas was saturated with D2O (by bubbling in a series of five vials containing D2O) at a flow rate of 51 ml/min (controlled by a Brooks flow meter). Bubbling was started at least 1 h before starting the experiment. Before starting the exchange, 10 spectra of the sample dried on the ATR plate were recorded in order to verify the stability of the measure and the reproducibility of the area determination. At zero time, the tubing was connected to the cavity of the sealed chamber surrounding the film. For each kinetic time point, 12 spectra are recorded and averaged at a resolution of 4 cm−1. At the beginning of the kinetics, spectra were recorded every 15 s. After the first 2 min, the time interval was increased exponentially. After 16 min, the interval between the scans was large enough to allow the interdigitation of second kinetics. A second sample placed on another ATR setup of the Perkin- Elmer sample shuttle was then analyzed with the same time sampling with a 16 min offset by connecting the D2O-saturated N2 flow in series with the first sample. From this time on, our program changed the shuttle position to follow the two kinetics (Goormaghtigh et al., 21Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-450Google Scholar, 22Goormaghtigh E. Vigneron L. Scarborough G.A. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27409-27413Google Scholar). Typically, one of the samples placed on the shuttle was prepared in the absence of substrate, and the other was prepared in the presence of a substrate as indicated. This procedure allowed us to test the reproducibility of the experiment under identical conditions. Background deuteration kinetics was recorded with the same germanium plate at the same position in the sample shuttle, but in the absence of the sample was substracted from the kinetics recorded in the presence of the sample. This allowed us to take into account the unavoidable variations in the atmospheric water content inside the spectrophotometer. Indeed, even though the spectrophotometer was purged with dry air for 20 min before starting the experiment, further removal of traces of water vapor took place for several hours, superimposing distinct sharp bands from the water vapor onto the protein spectra (Goormaghtigh and Ruysschaert, 17Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Spectrochim. Acta. 1994; 50A: 2137-3144Google Scholar). The subtraction of the background kinetics was improved by adopting the following automated procedure. A subtraction coefficient was first computed as the ratio of the area of the atmospheric water band integrated between 1565 and 1551 cm−1 on the sample spectrum and on the corresponding background spectrum. The areas of amide I, II, and II′ were obtained by integration between 1702 and 1596, 1596 and 1502, and 1492 and 1412 cm−1, respectively. For each spectrum, the area of amide II was divided by the corresponding lipidic ν(C=O) area. This permitted us to take into account small but significant variations of the overall spectral intensity due in part to the presence of D2O, which causes swelling of the sample layer and therefore increases the average distance between the protein sample and the germanium crystal surface. Since the ATR spectrum intensity depends on this distance (Harrick, 25Harrick N.J. Internal Reflection Spectroscopy. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1967Google Scholar), this resulted in a loss of a few percent of the band intensity for all measured bands. Undeuterated spectra were recorded before the kinetic experiment as explained above, and 100% deuterated sample values were extrapolated by assuming a value of zero for the amide II surface. The area of amide II (reported to the lipidic ν(C=O) area) was finally expressed between 0 and 100% for each kinetic time point. Iodide quenching experiments were carried out on a SLM Aminco 8000 fluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. Increasing amounts of KI were added from a 4 M stock solution to the proteoliposome suspension (1 ml in water) containing 8 μg of reconstituted P-glycoprotein and the various ligands. The KI solution contained 1 mM Na2S2O3 to prevent I2 and I(−)3 formation. Fluorescence intensities were read at 333 nm after each addition of quencher. All measurements were carried out at 25°C. Purified P-glycoprotein was reconstituted into proteoliposomes by gel filtration chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Asolectin was chosen as the lipid source since it was previously used for P-glycoprotein reconstitution (Shapiro and Ling, 33Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Google Scholar). Two protein:lipid ratios (1:10 and 1:20, w/w) were tested in order to optimize the protein reconstitution. The vesicles collected from the column were centrifuged on a 29% (w/v) glycerol solution with a 70% glycerol cushion to check whether pure protein aggregates were present or whether all the P-glycoprotein recovered in the reconstitution procedure was inserted within the proteoliposome membranes (Fig. 1). This glycerol concentration allows separation of free protein aggregates (at the 29%-70% glycerol interface) from proteoliposomes (at the 29%-0% glycerol interface). With a protein:lipid ratio of 1:10 (w/w), two distinct populations of proteoliposomes were detected (fractions 4-6 and fractions 9-12), revealing a nonhomogenous distribution of P-glycoprotein within the liposomes (Fig. 1, panel A). No free protein aggregates were observed at the 29%-70% glycerol interface. With a protein:lipid ratio of 1:20 (w/w), a single population of proteoliposomes was observed at the 29%-0% glycerol interface (fractions 10-14) and no protein aggregates were detected at the 29%-70% glycerol interface (Fig. 1, panel B). The protein:lipid ratio of 1:20 (w/w) was therefore selected as the more appropriate for P-glycoprotein reconstitution into proteoliposomes. It was shown previously that verapamil and a variety of anticancer agents stimulate the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein, with maximal stimulation occurring in the presence of verapamil (Sarkadi et al., 31Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Google Scholar; Al-Shawi and Senior, 2Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Google Scholar; Shapiro and Ling, 32Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Google Scholar). The effect of verapamil on the ATPase activity was therefore examined. Stimulation of the ATPase activity by verapamil was obtained when P-glycoprotein was reconstituted into proteoliposomes. The ATPase activity of the reconstituted P-glycoprotein (0.03 μmol/min/mg) was 2-3-fold stimulated by 10 μM verapamil (not shown). Addition of 2 mM Chaps to the proteoliposomes did not increase ATP hydrolysis, indicating that P-glycoprotein was inserted into the liposomes in an inside-out configuration with the ATP binding sites exposed to the external aqueous medium. This Chaps concentration was previously shown to permeabilize the proteoliposomes without inhibition of the P-glycoprotein ATPase activity (Shapiro et al., 1995; Sharom et al., 1993). The transport function of the reconstituted P-glycoprotein was assayed by measuring ATP-dependent accumulation of [3H] daunomycin in the proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes containing 5 μg of P-glycoprotein were incubated with 2 μM [3H]daunomycin and the uptake of daunomycin into the vesicles was determined both in the presence and in the absence of 3 mM MgATP (Fig. 2). Free drug was eliminated by gel filtration on Sephadex G50. In the absence of MgATP, the uptake measured likely represents passive diffusion of the molecule into the vesicles and partitioning into the membrane bilayer, as well as binding to P-glycoprotein. The difference between daunomycin accumulation in the presence and in the absence of MgATP was therefore considered to represent specific ATP-dependent transport. After 10 min, proteoliposomes treated with MgATP accumulated twice as much daunomycin as proteoliposomes without MgATP (Fig. 2). The secondary structure of the reconstituted P-glycoprotein was investigated by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). This method has been shown to be useful for the determination of membrane protein structure (Goormaghtigh et al., 18Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Google Scholar; 1990b; 1993; 1994a; 1994b; Goormaghtigh and Ruysschaert, 16Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Components by Computer Aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 285Google Scholar; Vigneron et al., 41Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17685-17696Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded in the absence and presence of MgATP-verapamil, MgATP, and MgADP. The IR spectra in the 1800-1400 cm−1 region are shown in Fig. 3. The amide I band, assigned to the ν(C=O) of the peptide bond, is located in the 1700-1600 cm−1 region. Its maximum at 1654 cm−1 is associated with a relatively high helicoidal content (Goormaghtigh et al., 21Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-450Google Scholar). The 1500-1570 cm−1 and the 1450 cm−1 bands represent, respectively, unexchanged and exchanged amide II, characteristic of the δ(N-H) and δ(N-D) amide bond. The lipidic ester ν(C=O) band is located in the 1700-1800 cm−1 region. In order to investigate whether modifications of the secondary structure occurred upon binding of the substrates, the spectra of P-glycoprotein recorded after addition of MgATP, MgADP, or MgATP-verapamil were subtracted from the spectrum of P-glycoprotein with no substrate added (Fig. 4). Subtractions were carried out after rescaling all the spectra to the same amide I area. Only minor deviations from the base line were observed in the difference spectra, indicating similar secondary structure contents. A quantitative evaluation of the secondary structures was obtained by a Fourier deconvolution and a curve-fitting analysis of the amide I region, which is the most sensitive to the secondary structure of proteins (Goormaghtigh et al., 18Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Google Scholar) (data not shown). The secondary structure percentages obtained are summarized in Table I. No significant difference in the protein secondary structure can be detected upon binding of the different molecules to P-glycoprotein (Table I, Fig. 4).Table ISecondary structure of P-glycoprotein determined in the absence and presence of substratesSubstrateα-Helixβ-SheetTurnsRandom coil%No ligand32262913MgATP-verapamil36252712MgATP36242614MgADP34252813 Open table in a new tab Kinetics of 2H/H exchange of the reconstituted P-glycoprotein was performed in the absence and presence of verapamil-MgATP, MgATP, and MgADP in order to check whether, upon binding of these molecules, the protein undergoes tertiary structure modifications. The infrared spectroscopy methodology allowed us to measure the kinetics of deuteration by recording a series of spectra as a function of the time of exposure to D2O (Fig. 5). Ten spectra of the protein were recorded before starting the exchange to verify the reproducibility of the measurement. A D2O-saturated N2 flow was then flushed in the sample chamber and infrared spectra were automatically recorded at increasing time intervals as the exchange proceeded. Upon deuteration, the amide II band associated with the δ(N-H) shifts from the 1500-1580 cm−1 region to the 1460 cm−1 region associated with the δ(N-D). The rate of exchange was estimated from the ratio of the amide II area to the corresponding lipidic ν(C=O) area to take into account variations of the ATR spectra intensity due to the swelling of the sample film upon hydration. The decrease of the amide II area, computed between 0 and 100% (see “Experimental Procedures”), is reported as a function of the deuteration time in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, about 50% of the P-glycoprotein is poorly accessible to the aqueous medium in the absence of ligands. This percentage is not significantly affected upon binding of MgADP (P-glycoprotein/MgADP molar ratio = 1:56). Addition of MgATP to P-glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein/MgATP molar ratio = 1:56) clearly results in an increase of the protein exchange rate. This increase is observed as soon as the exchange begins (as shown in Fig. 6B), and after 2 h of deuteration, the fraction of exchanged amino acids is increased from 50% (P-glycoprotein free of ligands) to 56% (P-glycoprotein with MgATP) (Fig. 6A). P-glycoprotein shows, on the other hand, a significant reduction of its exchange rate upon addition of MgATP-verapamil (P-glycoprotein/verapamil molar ratio = 1:1). The proportion of exchanged amino acids is reduced from 50% (no ligands) and 56% (MgATP) to 46% (MgATP-verapamil) (Fig. 6). Verapamil alone has no effect on the 2H/H exchange kinetics of P-glycoprotein (data not shown). Hydrogen atoms with different exchange rates are implicated in the exchange process. Since the 2H/H exchange is a first order reaction, the exchange curve is expected to display a multiexponential decay corresponding to the different groups of amide protons characterized by a common period Ti. H(t)=Σiaiexp−t/Ti(Eq. 1) where ai is the proportion of each amide group with identical Ti values. The large number of protons makes it impossible to obtain the individual rate constants. One approach to this problem is to choose arbitrarily a number of exponentials to fit the exchange curves. Three exponentials characterized by their period Ti (i = 1-3) and by their proportion ai of amide groups were chosen. A nonlinear fitting of all the experimental curves without constraints on the periods Ti and on the ai yields three periods T1, T2, and T3. Since these periods T1, T2, and T3, were similar for all the kinetic curves analyzed, a second fitting was performed for each curve, setting the Ti to their average value (T1 = 1, T2 = 15, and T3 = 2000 min) in order to compare the proportion ai of each amide group for the different experimental curves. The result is shown in Table II.Table II.Proportion (a1, a2, a3) of the three exponential components characterized by a half-decay of T1 = 1, T2 = 15, and T3 = 2000 minSubstratea1a2a3%No ligand24 (306)aNumbers in parentheses are the number of amino acids involved.23 (295)53 (676)MgATP28 (357)25 (320)47 (600)MgATP-verapamil16 (204)27 (345)57 (727)MgADP22 (281)27 (345)51 (650)a Numbers in parentheses are the number of amino acids involved. Open table in a new tab Addition of MgATP resulted in an increased accessibility to the solvent of a population of slowly exchanging amino acids (76 out of 676 amino acids). These slowly exchanging amide protons (T3 = 2000 min) are essentially changed into fast (T1 = 1 min) and intermediate (T2 = 15 min) exchanging species. Conversely, addition of MgATP-verapamil resulted in protection of a population of fast exchanging amino acids (102 out of 306), thereby confirming a direct interaction between P-glycoprotein and verapamil and demonstrating a verapamil-induced major conformational change in the enzyme. Minor changes in amino acid accessibility were observed upon addition of MgADP, characterized by a decrease of about 25 amino acid residues from both the slow and fast exchanging population to the intermediate one (Table II) resulting in the crossing over of the exchange curves (Fig. 6B). Eleven tryptophan residues are present in P-glycoprotein. Tryptophan quenching experiments were therefore performed, both in the absence and in the presence of MgATP and MgADP, to further investigate the effects of specific ligands on the enzyme tertiary structure. Verapamil was not used in these experiments by reason of its fluorescence emission at 333 nm. Fig. 7 shows Stern-Volmer plots of the effects of the aqueous quencher I(−) on fluorescence intensity. Similar profiles of quenching are observed in the absence and in the presence of 3 mM MgADP. The differences observed in the fluorescence intensities are due to quenching of the initial fluorescence (F0), measured in the absence of I(−), upon addition of MgADP or MgATP to the vesicles suspension. This initial quenching does not affect the fluorescence titration performed by addition of increasing amounts of I(−). In the presence of 3 mM MgATP, the quenching is much more pronounced confirming thereby that, conversely to MgADP, addition of MgATP resulted in an increased accessibility of a significant fraction of P-glycoprotein to the solvent. Many studies have been carried out on cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein or on plasma membrane vesicles. However, these systems can not be used to characterize the protein structure because of the presence of other cellular constituents. Shapiro and Ling (32Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Google Scholar, 33Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Google Scholar) purified P-glycoprotein from multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells and showed that this purified P-glycoprotein retained its ATPase activity and drug transport capability when reconstituted into liposomes. We decided therefore to perform a structure analysis on the purified P-glycoprotein reconstituted into liposomes. For this work, we devised a new reconstitution method yielding proteoliposomes with a high protein:lipid ratio. The resulting proteoliposomes exhibited ATP dependent drug transport and verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. P-glycoprotein was reconstituted with an inside-out configuration. Infrared spectroscopy analysis of the functionally reconstituted P-glycoprotein provided information concerning the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. The proportions of secondary structures estimated by ATR-FTIR were 32%α-helix, 26%β-sheet, 29%β-turn, and 13% unordered structure. The P-glycoprotein amino acid sequence suggests that the protein contains two hydrophobic domains, each consisting of six membrane-spanning helices. The proportion of α-helices determined experimentally is higher than the one expects just for the 12 putative membrane-spanning α-helices predicted, which represent only 20% of the protein. External α-helices or additional transmembrane helical segments have therefore to be considered. It is likely that the large cytoplasmic domains contains some α-helical structure. Importantly, addition of MgATP, MgATP-verapamil, or MgADP does not significantly alter P-glycoprotein secondary structures (Fig. 4 and Table I). The fact that limited trypsin proteolysis experiments indicated a conformational change in P-glycoprotein in the presence of MgATP 2M. Zhang, A. B. Shapiro, and J.-T. Zhang, personal communication. suggests that MgATP-induced changes are to be found in the tertiary structure of the enzyme. A similar result was recently obtained on a P-type H+-ATPase (Goormaghtigh et al., 22Goormaghtigh E. Vigneron L. Scarborough G.A. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27409-27413Google Scholar). While various ligands are known to modify the limited trypsin proteolysis pattern, the secondary structure of the enzyme was not affected (Goormaghtigh et al., 22Goormaghtigh E. Vigneron L. Scarborough G.A. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27409-27413Google Scholar). When the secondary structure is constant, amide 2H/H exchange experiments bring information on protein amide accessibility from the solvent and thereby allow detection of tertiary conformational changes and quantification of the number of amino acid residues involved. Comparison of ATR-FTIR experiments carried out on films with data obtained in solution by FTIR or NMR demonstrate the validity of this approach (de Jongh et al., 12de Jongh H. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 172-179Google Scholar). 2H/H exchange measurements provided evidence that a large fraction of the P-glycoprotein is poorly accessible to the aqueous medium. The slowly exchanging amino acids, characterized by a half-decay T3 = 2000 min, represent 53% of the total amino acid content of the protein. The presence of a large amide population characterized by a very low exchange rate could be due, in part, to the shielding effect of the membrane on a large number of residues. Transmembrane domains of several membrane proteins such as glycophorin or bacteriorhodopsin are inaccessible to the solvent as shown by their slow kinetics of amide 2H/H exchange (Challou et al., 6Challou N. Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Conrath K. Ruysschaert J.-M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6902-6910Google Scholar; Vigneron et al., 41Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17685-17696Google Scholar). The slowly exchanging amide protons of P-glycoprotein could therefore be formed by a core of amino acids located within the membrane. However, according to the protein sequence, the predicted transmembrane domains of P-glycoprotein account for only 20% of the total amino acids. A significant proportion of the slowly exchanging amino acids must therefore be located outside the membrane where they likely form highly structured domains. Interestingly, 2H/H exchange kinetics revealed major conformational changes upon addition of MgATP (increased accessibility for at least 76 amino acid residues) and MgATP-verapamil (decreased accessibility of at least 102 amino acid residues). However, as shown in Table II and in Fig. 6, the differences observed between MgADP and the control were not as clear, and we did not attempt to obtain any interpretation in terms of conformational change. No conformational change was observed upon addition of verapamil alone (data not shown), demonstrating that the verapamil-induced conformational change requires MgATP. Assigning the exchange differences to changes in the tertiary structure of the protein, even in the absence of secondary structure change, is not necessarily obvious. Indeed, exchange is likely to occur during transient (partial) unfolding of the secondary structures, and any perturbation of the system which increases the frequency of the transient unfolding event will have a significant impact on the exchange rate. This argument remains valid even if the transient unfolded species represents a very small fraction of the structure when compared to the ordered secondary structure. For instance, denaturating agents such as urea, temperature, or pH will increase the transiently unfolded species concentration, and thereby the 2H/H exchange rate, even though the secondary and tertiary structures are essentially unchanged. In the present study, because of the specificity of the ligands, no global, unspecific effect is expected. It is clear that, if unspecific effects were to occur, we would expect a similar effect from ADP and ATP, while we find different effects on the 2H/H exchange proving the specificity of the interaction, necessarily highly localized on the polypeptide chain. Yet, a large fraction of the polypeptide chain (at least 76 amino acid residues upon addition of ATP, see Table II) is affected even though ATP has only two binding sites on the protein and therefore cannot interact directly with 76 amino acid residues. Reconciling the highly localized binding of ATP on the polypeptide chain with its large spread effect on the exchange properties suggests a global tertiary structure change in the protein, but does not rule out a local destabilization of the tertiary structure. However, fluorescence quenching experiments indicated that, upon addition of MgATP, the enzyme adopts a different tertiary structure resulting in a significantly increased solvent accessibility of its tryptophan residues. Such major conformational changes were not observed upon binding of MgADP. Similarly, a P-type ATPase was recently shown to undergo major tertiary structure changes involving up to 175 out of a total of 920 amino acid residues upon addition of ligands. In contrast to P-glycoprotein, however, binding of MgADP or MgATP-vanadate to the P-type H+-ATPase resulted in protection of a large population of amino acids (Addison and Scarborough, 1Addison R. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10421-10426Google Scholar; Goormaghtigh et al., 22Goormaghtigh E. Vigneron L. Scarborough G.A. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27409-27413Google Scholar). The major differences observed between P-glycoprotein and the P-type proton ATPase upon addition of ligands indicate that their transport mechanisms differ. This is not surprising considering that the P-type ATPase forms a phosphoenzyme intermediate in catalysis, and P-glycoprotein does not. Tertiary structural changes revealed by 2H/H exchange upon addition of verapamil and MgATP are consistent with direct interactions between P-glycoprotein and the molecules transported and may be related to the stimulation of the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein by verapamil and other substrates and chemosensitizers. Senior and colleagues have suggested (Urbatsch et al., 39Urbatsch I.L. Banumathi S. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Google Scholar a, 1995b) that ATP hydrolysis by the two nucleotide binding sites of P-glycoprotein may occur by an alternating site mechanism. This would require tight conformational coupling between the two sites. The conformational change resulting from verapamil binding may tighten this coupling, perhaps bringing the two sites closer together and obscuring some formerly exposed amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2036775128,"Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is initially translated as a preprohormone which is posttranslationally processed to yield a family of mature secretory forms. Most attention has focused on the amino-terminal portion of the molecule which is homologous to parathyroid hormone. It is clear, however, that a mid-region species of PTHrP is posttranslationally cleaved from the highly conserved mid-region of PTHrP, and that the amino terminus of this peptide is Ala38. The purposes of the current study were three: 1) to confirm that Arg37 immediately preceding Ala38 serves as a posttranslational processing site in the PTHrP precursor, 2) to determine the carboxyl terminus of the mid-region secretory species of PTHrP, and 3) to synthesize this authentic mid-region secretory form of PTHrP and determine whether it is biologically active. The results indicate that: 1) Arg37 is indeed a processing site in the PTHrP precursor; 2) three distinct mid-region PTHrP species are generated by posttranslational processing, PTHrP(38-94)amide, PTHrP(38-95), and most likely, PTHrP(38-101); and 3) synthetic mid-region PTHrP(38-94)amide is active in four different biological systems. These studies confirm the finding that PTHrP is a prohormone. More importantly, they define a novel, biologically active highly conserved mid-region secretory form of PTHrP.

The purposes of the current study were three: 1) to confirm that Arg37 immediately preceding Ala38 serves as a posttranslational processing site in the PTHrP precursor, 2) to determine the carboxyl terminus of the mid-region secretory species of PTHrP, and 3) to synthesize this authentic mid-region secretory form of PTHrP and determine whether it is biologically active. The results indicate that: 1) Arg37 is indeed a processing site in the PTHrP precursor; 2) three distinct mid-region PTHrP species are generated by posttranslational processing, PTHrP(38-94)amide, PTHrP(38-95), and most likely, PTHrP(38-101); and 3) synthetic mid-region PTHrP(38-94)amide is active in four different biological systems. These studies confirm the finding that PTHrP is a prohormone. More importantly, they define a novel, biologically active highly conserved mid-region secretory form of PTHrP."

Total saponins and panaxatriol did not elevate the level of SOD1, but panaxadiol significantly increased SOD1. Among the panaxadiol fractions, ginsenoside Rb2 was a more specific and more remarkable inducer of the SOD1 gene than ginsenoside Rb1. Deletion analyses of the SOD1 promoter revealed that the proximal promoter is responsible for this induction. Mobility shift assays with cis-elements in the proximal promoter region showed that specific binding of the AP2 transcription factor was significantly increased by treatment with ginsenoside Rb2. Mutations of the AP2 binding sites in the heterologous promoter and natural context systems abolished the transcriptional activation by ginsenoside Rb2. These results suggest that the SOD1 gene was greatly activated by ginsenoside Rb2 through transcription factor AP2 binding sites and its induction.

This method enables real-time kinetic measurements of the interactions and calculations of kinetic constants and of the stoichiometry of interaction, even in cases where only transient interactions occur. In contrast to gel filtration or crystallographic studies, where in most cases the interaction of PRLR-ECDs with various lactogenic hormones indicated formation of 1:1 complexes, our surface plasmon resonance experiments indicated in all cases the transient formation of a 2:1 complex. In most of the interactions the 2:1 complex was very unstable and underwent rapid dissociation to a 1:1 complex. This situation was particularly characteristic of homologous interactions involving hormone and receptor from the same species and was mainly attributed to increased dissociation constants.

Four positionally conserved cysteine residues that form two disulfide bridges and a WSXWS motif are found, respectively, in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions of the ECD. Accumulating evidence indicates that ligand-induced homodimerization, heterodimerization, or oligomerization of the receptor is a common step that leads to the activation of the cytoplasmic, receptor-associated Jak tyrosine kinases (4Ihle J.N.

The most extensively studied interaction to date has been that between human (h) GH and hGHR-ECD. Using a slightly truncated, soluble, nonglycosylated hGHR-ECD (amino acids 1-238), de Vos and co-workers (10De Vos A. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar) crystallized the hormone-receptor complex, proving the simultaneous binding of the hormone to two hGHR-ECDs and structurally identified the different hGH sites involved in the interactions. Results of these studies substantiated those of Wells and co-workers (11Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. De Vos A. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Google Scholar), who were the first to suggest a hormone-induced sequential receptor homodimerization in which hGH binds one molecule of hGHR-ECD through site I, and then a second through site II, and offered a paradigm of ligand-induced receptor oligomerization in the cytokine receptor family (14Wells J.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 6: 163-173Google Scholar). These results were further confirmed by us using full-size (amino acids 1-246) hGHR-ECD (15Tchelet A. Sakal E. Vogel T. Krivi G.G. Creely D. Reichman E. Gertler A. Laron Z. Parks J.S. Pediatric and Adolescent Endocrinology. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1993: 114Google Scholar). Similar bovine (b) GH-induced homodimerization using recombinant soluble bGHR-ECD was also reported (16Staten N.R. Byatt J.C. Krivi G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18467-18473Google Scholar). Indirect evidence reported by us (17Dusanter-Fourt I. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Houdebine L.-M. Teyssot B. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1021-1027Google Scholar, 18Elberg G. Kelly P.A. Djiane J. Binder L. Gertler A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14770-14776Google Scholar) suggested that receptor dimerization or oligomerization also occurs in PRLR as an initial step in hormone-induced signal transduction. Thus, to evaluate whether the same paradigm of hormone-receptor interaction applies to PRL, we prepared soluble recombinant PRLR-ECDs from rabbit (rb) (19Gertler A. Petridou B. Krivi G.G. Djiane J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 277-281Google Scholar, 20Bignon C. Sakal E. Belair L. Chapnik-Cohen N. Djiane J. Gertler A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3318-3324Google Scholar), bovine (b) (21Tchelet A. Staten N.R. Creely D.P. Krivi G.G. Gertler A. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 144: 393-403Google Scholar), and rat (r) (22Sandowski Y. Nagano M. Bignon C. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Gertler A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 1-11Google Scholar) and studied their interactions with several PRLs and related lactogenic hormones in binding and gel filtration experiments. Results of those studies revealed a highly heterogeneous picture. Whereas with bPRLR-ECD, only 1:1 ECD-hormone complex could be detected (21Tchelet A. Staten N.R. Creely D.P. Krivi G.G. Gertler A. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 144: 393-403Google Scholar), with rbPRLR-ECD, most of the hormones reacted similarly with the exception of bovine placental lactogen (bPL) (20Bignon C. Sakal E. Belair L. Chapnik-Cohen N. Djiane J. Gertler A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3318-3324Google Scholar) and ovine (o)PL (23Sakal, E., Bignon, C. H., Kantor, A., Leibovitch, H., Shamay, A., Djiane, J., Gertler, A., (1995) Proceedings 77th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, Washington, D. C., June 14–17, 1995 (Abstr. P2–28)Google Scholar), in which a 2:1 stoichiometry was found. In contrast to the interactions of rPRLR-ECD with hGH, oPRL, bPL (22Sandowski Y. Nagano M. Bignon C. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Gertler A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 1-11Google Scholar), and oPL, 2A. Gertler, J. Grosclaude, C. J. Strasburger, S. Nir, and J. Djiane, unpublished observations. which yielded a 2:1 stoichiometry, homologous rPRL formed only a 1:1 complex. A similar 2:1 stoichiometry for the complex between rPRLR-ECD expressed in mammalian cells and oPRL was also reported (24Hooper K.P. Padmanabhan R. Ebner K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22347-22352Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that homodimerization of rPRLR-ECD by hGH, and even more so by oPRL, is concentration-dependent, and upon dilution from micromolar to nM concentrations, the complex dissociated from a 2:1 to a 1:1 form (22Sandowski Y. Nagano M. Bignon C. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Gertler A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 1-11Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies of the complex between hGH and hPRLR-ECD also revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry and documented the formation of the complex through site I of hGH (25Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Google Scholar). Furthermore, our research indicated that despite the differences in the binding properties and stoichiometries of interactions of the respective PRLR-ECDs and lactogenic hormones, the biopotencies of these hormones, as determined in several homologous or heterologous in vitro bioassays, were, surprisingly, almost identical (26Gertler A. Ashkenazi A. Madar Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1984; 34: 51-57Google Scholar, 27Berthon P. Kelly P.A. Djiane J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1987; 184: 300-306Google Scholar, 28Bramley T.A. Menzies G.S. McNeilly A.S. Friesen H.G. J. Endocrinol. 1987; 113: 365-374Google Scholar). The present work attempts to clarify this situation by making use of a novel method for real-time kinetic measurements of the interactions between macromolecules, based on surface plasmon resonance (29Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Google Scholar). This technique enables a determination of kinetic constants and the stoichiometry of interaction of a complex in which one component is immobilized on a flexible dextran matrix, whereas the other is free in solution. It has been used successfully for studies of hGH (30Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor (31Zhou M. Felder S. Rubinstein M. Hurwitz D.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16039-16044Google Scholar) receptors. Using this method, we detected weak dimeric complexes that had not been identified by classical binding, gel filtration, or crystallographic studies, and the kinetics of their formation and dissociation was assessed. Preliminary results of this study were reported at the Endocrine Society meeting (33Gertler, A., Grosclaude, J., Djiane, J., (1995) Proceedings 77th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, Washington, D. C., June 14–17, 1995 (Abstr. P2–11)Google Scholar). Recombinant bPL was prepared as described previously (34Gertler A. Hauser S.D. Sakal E. Vashdi D. Staten N. Freeman J.J. Krivi G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12655-12659Google Scholar), and recombinant hGH was obtained from Biotechnology General Inc. (Rehovot, Israel). Recombinant nonglycosylated rb, b, and r PRLR-ECDs and hGHR-ECD were prepared as described previously (15Tchelet A. Sakal E. Vogel T. Krivi G.G. Creely D. Reichman E. Gertler A. Laron Z. Parks J.S.

Kelly P.A. Gertler A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 1-11Google Scholar). Ovine PRL (NIDKK AFP-8277E) and rPRL (NIDKK rPRL-B3) were from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (Bethesda, MD), and rbPRL (AFP7730B) was from Dr. A. F. Parlow (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, CA). Human PRL was obtained from Dr. V. Goffin (Liege, Belgium). Monoclonal anti-hGH antibodies (mAbs) 10A7 and 7B11 were prepared as described elsewhere (35Strasburger C.J. Wu Z. Pflaum C.-D. Dressendorfer R.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1996; 81: 2613-2620Google Scholar). SPR reagents including CM5 sensor chips, Hepes buffer saline (HBS), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethanamine hydrochloride, and ethanolamine hydrochloride were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). Covalent linking of hGHR-ECD and rbPRLR-ECD was performed according to Johnsson et al. (29Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Google Scholar). The immobilization process was performed with 25 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% (w/v) P20 surfactant (HBS) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The matrix was activated for 3 min with 0.05 M EDC/NHS in HBS, followed by an 8-min injection of 80 mM 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethanamine hydrochloride in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5, and then rbPRLR-ECD (50 μg/ml) in 5 mM sodium borate buffer, pH 5, for 5 min, or hGHR-ECD (70 μg/ml) in 5 mM sodium borate buffer, pH 4.7, for 7 min. Unreacted matrix groups were deactivated through a 6-min injection of a 50 mML-cysteine, 1 M NaCl solution in 0.1 M sodium formate buffer, pH 4.3. This procedure ensured an immobilization of 4000 RU for hGHR-ECD and 800 RU for rbPRLR-ECD. Binding capacities of the immobilized R-ECDs were checked by sequential injections of 2.5 μM hormone solutions in HBS for 6 min followed by a regeneration pulse of 4.5 M MgCl2 for 1 to 2 min. The hormones were covalently linked according to Johnsson et al. (29Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Google Scholar). HBS was injected at 5 μl/min, and activation with 0.05 M EDC/NHS in HBS was carried out for 7-8 min. The various hormones were then injected at concentrations ranging from 50 to 100 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate buffers at pH values of 4.5-5, based on the optimal electric charge for electrostatic preconcentration on the matrix surface, preservation of the R-ECD binding capacities for the appropriate levels of hormone immobilization: hGH, pH 4.5 (1400 RU), oPRL, pH 4.7 (3100 RU), rbPRL, pH 4.7 (6800 RU), rPRL, pH 4.7 (2500 RU), bPL, pH 5 (5400 RU), and hPRL, pH 5 (3900 RU). Unreacted sites were blocked with an 8-min injection of 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride at pH 8.5. Binding capacities were checked by repeated injections of 5 μM R-ECDs in HBS. All immobilized hormones except rbPRL could be regenerated over 50 runs with 4.5 M MgCl2 pulses (1-2 min). Rabbit PRL was regenerated by washing out the bound R-ECDs with HBS for 20 min at 20 μl/min. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG-purified immunoglobulins were covalently linked to the matrix gel via amino-group coupling as recommended by Pharmacia Biosensor. Two anti-hGH mAbs (33Gertler, A., Grosclaude, J., Djiane, J., (1995) Proceedings 77th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, Washington, D. C., June 14–17, 1995 (Abstr. P2–11)Google Scholar) were used as capture antibodies: mAb 10A7, which binds hGH at a distance from both receptor interaction sites, and mAb 7B11 which binds to site II of hGH, thereby allowing the receptor to bind only to site I. Each of the mAbs prepared in HBS at 100 μg/ml was captured by a 6-min injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, which ensured immobilization of 2000 RU on rabbit anti-mouse IgG-purified immunoglobulins. For R-ECD-hGH interaction studies, saturating levels (2.5 μM) of hGH were injected for 6 min, and about 500 RU of the hormone were thus captured in each case. For kinetic characterization of hGH capture by the two mAbs, serial runs were performed with 0-1000 nM hormone solution. Regeneration at the end of each run was achieved by a 2-min pulse of 100 mM HCl. All experiments were performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min in HBS at 25°C. Once the hormone being tested was immobilized, either covalently through amino-group coupling or via mAb capture (for hGH), serial dilutions ranging from 1000 to 62.5 nM of each R-ECD were injected for 6 min and then washed out for 10 min prior to regeneration. Because the recombinant R-ECDs were lyophilized with sodium bicarbonate buffers at a salt:protein ratio of 1:2 ratio, bulk refractive indexes varied with sample dilution and were corrected by injections of the same dilutions into flow cells where unrelated ligands had been immobilized. In experiments in the presence of Zn2+, hormones were immobilized in HBS as described earlier. Then the 15 μM ZnCl2 was added to the HBS running buffer, and all subsequent dilutions were performed in 15 μM ZnCl2-containing HBS. BIAcore incorporated software (BIA Evaluation and BIA Simulation) allowed us to 1) fit experimental curves with 1:1 or 1:2 association/dissociation models and calculate the probabilities of either one of these being the most accurate representation of reality, and 2) calculate kinetic constants with standard deviations; reverse verification of calculated data was performed by simulating the interaction assuming a variable relative occupation of sites. The solution concentration of the receptor at time t is denoted R(t), whereas its concentration in the flowing solution is Ro. Eventually, i.e. in a steady state, R(t) = Ro. The hormone can exist in any of the four states H(0,0), H(1,0), H(0,1) and (H1,1), which denote, respectively, the concentrations of hormone molecules without bound receptors, or with one receptor at site I or site II or sites I and II. The set of nonlinear differential equations describing the process of receptor binding is given in Appendix Appendix I. Schematically, in the case of independent binding sites, the binding reactions considered are: H(0,0)+RkI,onkI,off←H(1,0)(Eq. 1) H(0,0)+R⇄kII,onkII,offH(0,1)(Eq. 2) H(1,0)+RkH,onkH, off H(1,1)(Eq. 3) H(0,1)+RkI,0nkI,offH(1,1)(Eq. 4) The depleted concentration of the receptor is continuously replenished due to the flow, but depending on hormone concentration, the flow rate, and the reaction rate constants, R(t) may be severalfold smaller than Ro. We assumed that the interaction follows a sequential pattern, whereby H(0,1) cannot be formed from H(0,0), i.e. the forward direction in Equation 2 is ignored, but H(0, 1Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar) can be formed by dissociation of H(1,1), i.e. the reverse reaction in Equation 4. The steady state solutions turn out to be independent of the flow rate and are the same as those obtained by assuming constant receptor concentrations. For the case of independent sites we found an analytic solution for the steady state stage: H(0,0)=1/1+KI+KIIRo+KIKIIRo2(Eq. 5) H(1,0)=KIRσ/1+KI+KHRo+KIKIIRo2(Eq. 6) H(0,1)=KIIRα/1+KI+KIIR∘+KIKIIRo2(Eq. 7) H(1,1)=KIKIIRo2/1+KI+KIIR∘+KIKIIRo2(Eq. 8) in which the bars indicate the fractions of hormones in the different states and KI = kI, on/kI, off and KII = kII, on/kII, off. These equations show that in the limit of Ro→ 0, H(0,0) = 1, whereas the other quantities vanish, and when Ro tends to infinity, H(1,1) = 1 and the other quantities vanish. The steady state solutions are independent of hormone concentration. Initially, rb, r, and bPRLR-ECDs were immobilized via their single free cysteine residue. Despite reasonably good covalent binding (2000-3000 RU/mm2), the immobilized ECDs totally lost their ability to bind to the different PRLs, bPL, or hGH. Alternative immobilization of PRLR-ECDs using a cross-linker acting through amino groups also failed, and the binding capacity of the immobilized ECDs was drastically reduced. This most likely happened because of heterogeneous immobilization via several amino groups, some of them probably being important for hormone binding. An alternative protocol was employed to overcome this difficulty; the respective hormones were immobilized via their amino groups. This method yielded promising results; in all cases, the immobilized hormones retained a high capacity of interaction with soluble PRLR-ECDs or, in the case of hGH, with hGHR-ECD. As shown in Tables I, II, III, IV, the immobilized hormones were capable of binding the soluble R-ECDs with apparent stoichiometries ranging from 1:1 to 1:2, under conditions in which the ligands were applied at 0.25-1 μM.Table I.Calculation of kinetic and thermodynamic constants of sites I and II for the interaction between rabbit PRLR-ECD and several lactogenic hormonesHormone (sites I and II)kon(mol−1· s−1) × 104koff (s−1) × 10−4KdECD:hormone (molar ratio) SPRaApparent stoichiometry as determined by surface plasmon resonance.Half-lifeμMminhGHbBound covalently.

Open table in a new tab The interactions of rbPRLR-ECD with oPRL and hGH yielded similar kinetic parameters (Fig. 1A and Table I). The apparent stoichiometry indicated a 1:1 interaction at equilibrium. However, analysis of the kinetic data by fitting to a theoretical model (Fig. 2) showed to be unsuited to the 1:1 model and strongly favoring the two-site model. Similar results were also obtained with hPRL; although here, the apparent stoichiometry of interaction was 2:1. Interaction with rPRL also yielded a 2:1 apparent stoichiometry, but in this instance the kon values were ~10-fold higher than those of aforementioned complexes. The interaction with bPL was much stronger, mainly due to a relatively low koff for site II, and an apparent 2:1 complex was observed by both SPR and gel filtration analysis (20Bignon C. Sakal E. Belair L. Chapnik-Cohen N. Djiane J. Gertler A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3318-3324Google Scholar). As can be seen, the interaction of rbPRLR-ECD with the putative site I of all hormones was always much stronger than with site II, although the relative affinities varied to a large extent. The lower affinity for site II unanimously originated from elevated koff values, whereas the kon values had hardly any effect. In contrast, the interaction with the homologous hormone rbPRL was characterized by a rather weak interaction with both sites I and II.Fig. 2Fitting analysis by BIAcore software of the dissociation kinetics of rbPRLR-ECD bound to immobilized rbPRL (see Fig. 1A, lower panel) for one-site model (upper panel) and two-site model (lower panel). The theoretical predicted dissociation curve is shown by a solid line (–), and the experimental results by points (···). The residual difference between theoretical and experimental curves are represented on expanded scale (right). The signal noise in BIAcore corresponds to 4-6 RU.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interaction of bPRLR-ECD with oPRL, bPL, and hGH indicated formation of an apparent 1:1 complex as determined by both SPR (Fig. 1B and Table II) and gel filtration (21Tchelet A. Staten N.R. Creely D.P. Krivi G.G. Gertler A. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 144: 393-403Google Scholar). However, analysis of association and dissociation kinetics, performed as shown in Fig. 2 (data not presented), indicated a complete lack of fit to the presumed one-site model and a very good fit to the two-site model. Simulation analysis also favored the 50/50 double-site model with the exception of hGH. As in the binding of hGH, the different affinities for sites I and II could be attributed to the 10-20-fold higher koff values for site II, whereas the differences in the kon values were relatively small. Similar to the aforementioned case of homologous interaction, the interaction of bPRLR-ECD with oPRL (identical to bPRL) and bPL, both homologous hormones, was also characterized by a relatively lower affinity of the homologous hormones, not only for site II but also for site I. Here again, the lower affinity resulted mainly from the increase in koff. The interaction of rPRLR-ECD with different hormones (Fig. 1C and Table III) yielded in SPR experiments an apparent stoichiometry of 2:1, except with rPRL in which only a 1:1 stoichiometry has been observed, as also shown in gel filtration experiments (22Sandowski Y. Nagano M. Bignon C. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Gertler A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 1-11Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis revealed a very good fit to the two-site model and a poor fit to the one-site model. All kinetic parameters also gave an optimal 50/50 two-site simulation analysis. Bovine PL exhibited the highest affinity to both sites I and II, although the latter was relatively lower, mainly due to a 5-fold higher koff value as compared with site I. Other hormones, such as h or oPRL, exhibited lower affinities for binding to both sites, again mainly due to higher koff values. The affinity of rPRLR-ECD for the homologous rPRL was weaker than for other hormones. Whereas the affinities and kinetic constants for site I resembled those of oPRL and hPRL, the affinity to site II was 6-15-fold lower, primarily because of a lower kon. Direct, covalent immobilization of the hormones via their amino groups raised the question of whether the immobilization yielded homogeneous or heterogeneous populations. The latter could affect the calculation of association and dissociation kinetic constants. To answer this question, an alternative method of homogeneous immobilization of hGH was employed using two anti-hGH mAbs, mAb 10A7 which binds to hGH in a way that does not interfere with the latter's ability to form a 1:2 homodimeric complex with hGHR-ECD, and mAb 7B11 which interacts with an epitope located within site II of hGH and, as such, enables only a 1:1 interaction through site I (35Strasburger C.J. Wu Z. Pflaum C.-D. Dressendorfer R.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1996; 81: 2613-2620Google Scholar). Both mAbs were captured by a covalently immobilized rabbit anti-mouse IgG-purified immunoglobulins. The association of hGH with mAb 7B11 was ~20-fold slower than with 10A7 (kon = 0.98 × 104 and 2.05 × 105 mol−1 s−1, respectively), and the dissociation was also ~3-fold slower (koff = 4.5 × 10−5 and 14.1 × 10−5 s−1, respectively).

Interaction between what were once considered distinct signal transduction pathways is beginning to emerge as the rule of the intracellular events leading to cellular growth and differentiation. A paradigm of such an interaction has surfaced that interconnects two families of transcription factors, which are the principal pathways used by the cell to convey signals into the nucleus: the signals transmitted by nuclear receptors and the nuclear proto-oncoproteins c-Jun and c-Fos. Nuclear receptors comprise one of the largest families of transcription factors, which, upon binding of their cognate ligand, stimulate (in some cases, inhibit) the rate of transcription of their target genes and, in this way, modulate cellular differentiation (reviewed in 1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar and 2Gronemeyer H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2524-2529Google Scholar). The nuclear receptor superfamily includes the receptors for steroid and thyroid hormones, retinoids, vitamin D3, and an ever-growing number of other identified and unidentified ligands (reviewed in 1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar, 2Gronemeyer H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2524-2529Google Scholar, 3Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Google Scholar, 4Simons S.S. Oshima H. Szapary D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 995-1002Google Scholar). Like nuclear receptors, the proto-oncoproteins c-Jun and c-Fos can also modulate transcription, but this modulation results in the regulation of cellular proliferation (reviewed in 5Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Google Scholar). The heterodimer of c-Jun and c-Fos, AP-1, activates transcription of target genes by binding to specific promoter elements, called TREs 1The abbreviations used are: TRE12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elementGRglucocorticoid receptorPRprogesterone receptorERestrogen receptorARandrogen receptorhARhuman ARRAretinoic acidRARretinoic acid receptorRXRretinoid X receptorDBDDNA binding domainCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseMMTVmurine mammary tumor virustkthymidine kinase; β-gal, β-galactosidaseDHTdihydrotestosterone9C-RA9-cis-RAPKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

Conversely, the activation of the collagenase and stromelysin genes by AP-1 is repressed in a ligand-dependent manner by several receptors, including GR (9Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K-K.

Karin M. Pfahl M. New Biol. 1991; 3: 1206-1219Google Scholar). In contrast to these inhibitory effects, there have been several reports suggesting cooperative interactions between nuclear receptors and AP-1. Cotransfection of expression plasmids for c-Jun, c-Fos, and ER causes synergistic activation of the ovalbumin gene (20Gaub M.-P. Bellard M. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 63: 1267-1276Google Scholar). Similarly, the GR has been shown to potentiate c-Jun-activated transcription from the proliferin promoter (21Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Google Scholar). Recently, Harrison et al. (22Harrison R.J. McNeil G.P. Dobner P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 981-993Google Scholar) have found that both c-Jun and c-Fos can synergistically activate with the GR the neurotensin/neuromedin gene promoter. The mechanism of cooperation on both the proliferin and neurotensin/neuromedin promoters appears to be at the level of DNA binding, since both promoters contain and require functional glucocorticoid response element and AP-1 elements for the synergistic interaction between GR and c-Jun and/or c-Fos. Contrasting this requirement for DNA binding, c-Jun is also known to positively affect the transcriptional activity of GR (23Maroder M. Farina A.R. Vacca A. Felli M.P. Meco D. Screpanti I. Frati L. Gulino A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 570-584Google Scholar) and AR (16Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3839-3849Google Scholar) without binding to DNA. However, the specific outcome of the c-Jun interaction with GR appears to be dependent on unknown cell-specific factors, since the c-Jun effect is negative in HeLa and Cos cells (9Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K-K. Cato A.C.B. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Google Scholar, 10Lucibello F. Slater E.P. Jooss K. Beato M. Muller R.

Chambard J-C. Sun Y-L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.J. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Google Scholar) and positive in several T-cell lines (23Maroder M. Farina A.R. Vacca A. Felli M.P. Meco D. Screpanti I. Frati L. Gulino A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 570-584Google Scholar). On the other hand, c-Jun stimulates AR-mediated transactivation without any apparent dependence on cell- and/or promoter-specific factors (16Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3839-3849Google Scholar). This general effect of c-Jun on AR activity opened the possibility that this proto-oncoprotein may mediate AR-induced transcription and perhaps act as a coactivator. We provide in this paper evidence that c-Jun is able to support AR-mediated transactivation. Using transient transfection studies, we show here that AR is stimulated by both exogenous and endogenous c-Jun, c-Jun can relieve AR self-squelching, the c-Jun effect is primary, and that c-Fos counteracts the positive effect of c-Jun. Finally, we demonstrate that c-Jun and hAR can interact in Cos cells, as measured using a form of the yeast two-hybrid system adapted for mammalian cells. Human forms of AR and c-Jun were all expressed from the mammalian expression plasmid pSG5 (24Green S. Isseman I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Google Scholar). The GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the upstream oligo 5′-GATCGAATTCGATATCTAGAAGCTTCTATGAAGCTACTGTCT-3′ and the downstream oligo 5′-GATCAGATCTATTCAGTCAGGGCCCGAGCTCGGAT CCGGT-3′ and inserted into pTLI, a derivative of pSG5 (24Green S. Isseman I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Google Scholar), to make the plasmid pG4AB. The hAR CD region was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the upstream oligo 5′-GATCGAATTCATGAAGACCTGCCTGATCTGT-3′ and the downstream oligo 5′-GATCTCTAGAAAGCCTTCAATGTGTGACAC-3′ and inserted into pG4AB, yielding GAL-hAR(CD). The hAR DE region was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the upstream oligo 5′-gatcGGTACCCTCGAGTCTAGAACTCTGGGAGCCCGGAAG-3′ and the downstream oligo 5′-gatcGGATCCTCACTGGGTGTGGAAATA-3′ and inserted into pG4AB, yielding GAL-hAR(DE). GAL4-c-Fos(Δ1-114) was constructed by digesting c-Fos(Δ1-114) (16Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3839-3849Google Scholar) with EcoRI, filling in with Klenow and then digesting with BamHI, and inserted into pG4AB. All clones have been verified by DNA sequencing (available upon request). The reporter plasmids have the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) driven by the MMTV, TRE-tk, or 17M-tk promoters. The AR-inducible reporter plasmid MMTV-CAT and the GAL4-inducible reporter 17M-tk-CAT have been described previously (16Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3839-3849Google Scholar). The AP-1-inducible reporter TRE-tk-CAT was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide (CTAGTCAGC containing a single copy of the TRE from the collagenase gene promoter into the plasmid pBL GATGTCG) containing a single copy of the TRE from the collagenase gene promoter into the plasmid pBL-CAT8+. Transfection efficiency was standardized by measuring the β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity, originating from the cotransfected plasmid pCH110. Cos and P19 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) and minimal essential medium α (Sigma), respectively, and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories). Cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (25Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Quirin-Stricker C. Bocquel M.T. Meyer M.E. Krozowski Z. Jelsch J.M. Lerouge T. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3985-3994Google Scholar). The hAR was activated by the addition of 100 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT). CAT assays were performed and standardized according to the measured β-gal activity, as described previously (25Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Quirin-Stricker C. Bocquel M.T. Meyer M.E. Krozowski Z. Jelsch J.M. Lerouge T. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3985-3994Google Scholar). For all transfections, we used different amounts of expression plasmid, 1 μg of reporter plasmid (either MMTV-CAT, TRE-tk-CAT, or 17M-tk-CAT), 2 μg of pCH110, and enough Bluescript to bring the final plasmid amount to 10 μg/dish. RA induction of P19 cells was performed by adding 100 nM of the stereoisomer 9-cis-RA (9C-RA) immediately after the cells were split into the 60-mm dishes. 9C-RA has been shown to activate both kinds of RA receptors, RARs and RXRs (26Allenby R.L.

Kawakami Z. Chiu R. Ozawa K. Matsuoka T. Toyoshima S. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 167-175Google Scholar). CAT assays were quantified by cutting the thin-layer chromatography plates and measuring the radioactivity using liquid scintillation counting. Activity was determined by comparing the total radioactivity loaded to that converted to acetylated product. Note that all transfections were done at least three times, and the results presented in this study are representative. To prepare cell extracts for Western blot analysis, the pellets from transfected cells remaining after extraction for β-gal and CAT assays were boiled for 5-10 min in SDS sample buffer (63 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5%β-mercaptoethanol). The amount of extract used was standardized according to β-gal activity. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose. After blocking with nonfat dry milk, the nitrocellulose blots were probed with either the anti-AR antibody PG-21 (Affinity Bioreagents) or anti-c-Jun antibody c-Jun/AP-1(D) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were developed using the chemiluminescence detection kit from Amersham Corp. To measure the transcriptional activity of hAR, Cos cells were transfected with an hAR-expressing pSG5 plasmid and the reporter plasmid MMTV-CAT. MMTV-CAT has the CAT gene under the control of an MMTV promoter, which has multiple androgen-responsive elements (also called glucocorticoid response elements or GREs) that can respond to AR, GR, and PR. The ability of DHT-activated hAR to stimulate transcription from MMTV-CAT in cultured Cos cells was weak (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 7). However, when c-Jun (also expressed from pSG5) was coexpressed with hAR, there was strong stimulation of hAR activity (5-15-fold above the activity measured in the absence of transfected c-Jun) that was dependent on the amount of c-Jun expression plasmid transfected (Fig. 1A, compare lane 7 with lanes 8-10). The effect of c-Jun is on ligand-activated hAR, since there was no c-Jun effect on hAR in the absence of DHT (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 4-6 with lanes 8-10). Furthermore, c-Jun had no significant effect on the MMTV reporter in the absence of transfected hAR (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2). The positive effect of c-Jun on hAR activity could be due to enhanced levels of hAR protein expression in the presence of transfected c-Jun. However, Western blot analysis showed that c-Jun, at various plasmid concentrations, does not significantly affect the expression of hAR protein nor its mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B, compare lane 3 with lanes 4-6), suggesting that exogenous c-Jun does not cause a change in posttranslational modifications of hAR. In addition, stability of hAR is not altered by transfected c-Jun. 2A. Bubulya, S. Wise, and L. Shemshedini, unpublished data. The weak hAR activity observed in the absence of transfected c-Jun (see Fig. 1A, lane 3) might be due to endogenous c-Jun in Cos cells. Endogenous c-Jun was measured by both Western blot analysis and transcriptional activity. The Western blot indicated that endogenous c-Jun is in low but detectable concentrations in Cos cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 3), and that this is greatly enhanced in a dose-dependent manner by transfecting the c-Jun plasmid (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3-6). Coexpression of hAR does not affect the expression nor the mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of transfected c-Jun (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 2 and 6). In support of the Western blot results, measuring c-Jun by monitoring transcriptional activation of TRE-tk-CAT, an AP-1-inducible reporter, showed low levels of endogenous AP-1 in Cos cells, and CAT expression was greatly enhanced by transfecting c-Jun.2 These results clearly show that Cos cells have low but significant levels of endogenous c-Jun and that this is greatly enhanced by transiently transfecting c-Jun into these cells, corresponding to a concomitant increase in hAR transcriptional activity. Previous studies indicate that RA can induce in F9 cells the expression of endogenous c-Jun, without affecting the expression of c-Fos (29Kitabayashi I. Kawakami Z. Chiu R. Ozawa K. Matsuoka T. Toyoshima S. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 167-175Google Scholar). Using a derivative of F9 cells, P19 cells (30McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. Edwards M.K.S. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Google Scholar), we tested whether endogenous c-Jun can have the same positive effect on hAR as does transfected c-Jun. We first tested for the RA effect on c-Jun expression in P19 cells. 9C-RA (10−7M), which is known to activate both kinds of RA receptors, RARs and RXRs (26Allenby R.L. Bocquel M.T. Saunders M.

Grippo J.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 359-361Google Scholar), induction of c-Jun was measured by monitoring transcriptional activation from the TRE-tk-CAT. 9C-RA treatment of P19 cells resulted in a strong (5-fold) stimulation of TRE-tk-CAT (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4). The 9C-RA activation of TRE-tk-CAT was comparable to that by transfected c-Jun (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 4), indicating that RA can induce the expression of endogenous c-Jun in P19 cells, as it can in F9 cells (29Kitabayashi I. Kawakami Z. Chiu R. Ozawa K. Matsuoka T. Toyoshima S. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 167-175Google Scholar). Western blot analysis performed with extracts from P19 cells treated with 9C-RA confirmed that the RA induction of AP-1 activity was due to an increase in endogenous c-Jun expression.2 Since RA can induce expression of endogenous c-Jun in P19 cells, we tested the possibility that RA can indirectly, via its induction of c-Jun, stimulate hAR activity. Therefore, we repeated the transient transfection experiment described above, but this time measured hAR activity on MMTV-CAT. Importantly, 9C-RA treatment of P19 cells resulted in enhanced hAR transcriptional activity that was at least as strong as that stimulated by transfected c-Jun (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 6 and 9). 9C-RA had no effect on MMTV-CAT in the absence of transfected hAR.2 It is significant that RA, like transfected c-Jun, does not affect the expression of hAR.2 These results strongly suggest that the effect transfected c-Jun has on hAR can be reproduced with endogenous c-Jun and is consistent with c-Jun mediating the transcriptional activity of hAR. Initial evidence for mediators of nuclear receptor transactivation came from the observation that transiently transfecting increasing amounts of an ER-expressing plasmid into cultured cells results in bell-shaped curves of transcriptional activation (31Bocquel M.T. Kumar V. Stricker C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2581-2595Google Scholar) and was attributed to the titration of a coactivator(s). To determine if hAR can undergo self-squelching, increasing amounts of the hAR expression plasmid were transfected into Cos cells, and hAR transcriptional activity was measured on MMTV-CAT. hAR transcriptional activity increased in a dose-dependent manner to a maximal level (23-fold) with 0.25 μg of the hAR plasmid (Figs. 3A, lanes 1-3, and B). When the hAR plasmid was further increased, CAT activity decreased to nearly basal levels with 3 μg of hAR (Figs. 3A, lanes 4-6, and 3B). Therefore, hAR activity on MMTV-CAT follows the expected bell-shaped curve and demonstrates self-squelching by hAR, suggesting the titration of a coactivator of hAR transcriptional activity as the hAR protein level increases. Transfecting increasing amounts of hAR plasmid does result in a dose-dependent increase in hAR protein levels (Fig. 3C, lanes 1-6). Since c-Jun is able to stimulate hAR transactivation (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2), we wanted to test whether this proto-oncoprotein could relieve hAR self-squelching. Thus, the squelching experiment above was repeated in the presence of 5 μg of transfected c-Jun plasmid. c-Jun was not only able to relieve hAR self-squelching (Fig. 3A, lanes 9-12) but resulted in a stronger hAR transactivation (90-fold) than the maximal activity measured in the absence of transfected c-Jun (23-fold) (compare lanes 3 and 12). These results suggest that endogenous c-Jun is limiting in Cos cells and argue strongly that c-Jun is a mediator for hAR-induced transactivation. To obtain evidence for c-Jun having a primary effect on hAR-mediated transactivation, a time-course experiment was performed to determine at what point during the course of a transient transfection experiment c-Jun action on hAR activity is first detected. This was done by measuring CAT activity and comparing this to the first appearance of hAR and c-Jun proteins, as measured by Western blot analysis. Thus, Cos cells were transfected with hAR plasmid minus/plus the c-Jun plasmid and harvested at six different times: 6, 12, or 24 h after the DNA was added (Post-DNA) or 6, 12, or 24 h after the cells were washed and fresh medium was added (Post-Wash) following a prior 24-hr incubation with DNA and then exposed to a CAT assay (Fig. 4A). Initial transactivation by hAR was observed 6 h Post-Wash (Fig. 4B, lanes 3-10), and it was only seen in the presence of transfected c-Jun (compare lanes 9 and 10). Western blot analysis indicated that this time corresponded exactly with the time when expressed hAR (Fig. 4C, lanes 3-10) and c-Jun (Fig. 4D, lanes 3-10) proteins were first detected. Moreover, hAR transcriptional activity increased with increasing incubation period (Fig. 4B, lanes 9-14), which corresponded with a concomitant increase in hAR and c-Jun protein levels (Figs. 4, C and D, lanes 9-14). Little, if any, hAR transactivation was seen prior to washing the cells (that is, during the Post-DNA stage) (Fig. 4B, lanes 3-8). Therefore, the c-Jun effect on hAR transactivation is observed as soon as exogenous c-Jun is expressed, ruling out a possible secondary effect of c-Jun. More importantly, this result is consistent with c-Jun having a primary, and perhaps direct, effect on hAR. The time-course results above suggest that c-Jun has a primary effect on hAR, a contention supported by our finding that c-Fos has an antagonistic effect on hAR-induced transactivation. c-Fos is able to repress hAR activity both in the absence (Fig. 5, compare lane 4 with lanes 5-7) and presence of transfected c-Jun (Fig. 5, compare lane 8 with lanes 9-11). These results suggest that: 1) the c-Jun-c-Fos heterodimer is unable to support hAR-induced transcription; and 2) the weak activity observed with hAR in the absence of transfected c-Jun is probably due to low levels of endogenous c-Jun present in Cos cells (Fig. 1C). The effect of c-Jun on hAR transcriptional activity could be mediated by protein-protein interactions between the two proteins. To test for this, we have used a form of the yeast two-hybrid system adapted for mammalian cells. A similar system has been used previously to show interactions between the C and N termini of the AR (32Langley E. Zhou Z. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Google Scholar). In this system, which we call a mammalian one-hybrid assay, protein-protein interactions are studied in cultured mammalian cells using mammalian plasmids. This system consists of two expression plasmids, both based on the mammalian plasmid pSG5 (24Green S. Isseman I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Google Scholar) and the reporter plasmid 17M-tk-CAT. One expression plasmid encodes the GAL4-DBD fused to our “bait,” the CD regions of hAR; the other plasmid encodes c-Jun, which contains its own activation functions. We elected to use the CD regions of hAR since previous results with the GR, whose DBD (C region) is highly homologous to that of AR, have shown a protein-protein interaction between GR and c-Jun, which is mediated by the GR C region (9Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K-K. Cato A.C.B. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Google Scholar, 10Lucibello F. Slater E.P. Jooss K. Beato M. Muller R.

Chambard J-C. Sun Y-L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.J. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Google Scholar). Activation of the 17M-tk-CAT reporter results when hAR(CD) interacts stably with c-Jun, bringing the c-Jun activation functions to the tk promoter and causing the expression of the CAT gene. Cos cells were transfected with various combinations of hybrid plasmids (described in Fig. 6A), and CAT activity was measured (Fig. 6B). As expected, GAL-VP16 was a strong activator of 17M-tk-CAT (compare lanes 1 and 2). There was no observable CAT activity with GAL(DBD) (compare lanes 1 and 3), hAR(CD)-GAL (compare lanes 1 and 4), or GAL-c-Fos(Δ1-114) (compare lanes 1 and 5), eliminating the presence of any possible cryptic activation functions in these proteins. c-Jun alone was also inactive (compare lanes 1 and 7), indicating that there is no unexpected binding of c-Jun to the 17M-tk-C"

These enzymes exhibit distinct substrate specificities and spatial localization within a wound. Collagenase-1 is capable of degrading fibrillar collagens (types I and III), abundant constituents of the dermal matrix, whereas stromelysin-1 degrades basement membrane components such as laminin and proteoglycans. Collagenase-1 is invariably produced by the migrating front of basal keratinocytes in both acute and chronic wounds (17Saarialho-Kere U.K. Chang E.S. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin.

Collagenase-producing keratinocytes migrate over the dermal matrix, and contact with type I collagen is an important determinant of enzyme induction (18Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P.

In contrast, stromelysin-1 is expressed only in chronic wounds by the proliferating population of keratinocytes, which are just behind the migrating front and still in contact with the underlying basement membrane (22Saarialho-Kere U.K. Pentland A.P.

In the present study, we examined the effects of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) on the production of collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 by keratinocytes. Originally characterized as a hepatocyte mitogen (23Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Aaronson S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Because HGF/SF induces keratinocyte matrix metalloproteinase expression and also stimulates keratinocyte migration and proliferation, this epithelial mitogen may have an important role in regulating wound healing responses.DISCUSSIONKeratinocyte function during cutaneous wound repair is probably regulated by cell-cell and cell-matrix (18Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J.E. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Google Scholar) interactions and also by exposure to soluble factors. In the present study, we examined the capacity of HGF/SF to modulate keratinocyte metalloproteinase production. Although HGF/SF is known to stimulate keratinocyte migration and proliferation (24Matsumoto K. Hashimoto K. Yoshikawa K. Nakamura T. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 114-120Google Scholar, 25Sato C. Tsuboi R. Shi C.M. Rubin J.S. Ogawa H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 958-963Google Scholar) and to promote wound healing in several in vitro models (47Watanabe S. Hirose M. Wang X.E. Maehiro K.

Physiol. 1994; 267: F257-F264Google Scholar), this is the first report of its ability to regulate matrix metalloproteinase expression in any cell type in a physiologic setting.In a wound environment, the two matrix metalloproteinases expressed prominently by keratinocytes are interstitial collagenase-1 (MMP-1) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) (17Saarialho-Kere U.K. Chang E.S. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1952-1957Google Scholar, 18Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J.E. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin.

Collagenase-1 is produced by migrating keratinocytes at the front of reepithelialization in both acute and chronic wounds (17Saarialho-Kere U.K. Chang E.S. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1952-1957Google Scholar, 18Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J.E. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Google Scholar). Furthermore, keratinocytes which express collagenase-1 are not in contact with the basement membrane but reside on dermal and provisional matrix (18Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J.E. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Google Scholar). Our previous in vitro studies have shown that type I collagen, the most abundant component of the dermal matrix, induces collagenase-1 production in human keratinocytes (18Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J.E. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Google Scholar, 21Sudbeck B.D. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Pentland A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30022-30029Google Scholar). We report here that HGF/SF stimulation of collagenase-1 production is much greater in keratinocytes cultured on type I collagen than in cells grown on gelatin or Matrigel (Fig. 2). Similarly, matrix components can modulate the morphogenic effects of HGF/SF in other contexts (50Santos O.F.P. Nigam S.K. Dev. Biol. 1993; 160: 293-302Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that cell-matrix interactions are an important regulator of keratinocyte collagenase-1 production and suggest that, in vivo, the effects of HGF/SF and possibly other growth factors on keratinocytes may be modulated by contact with specific extracellular matrix components.In chronic wounds, stromelysin-1 is expressed by the proliferating population of keratinocytes that are in contact with the underlying basement membrane (22Saarialho-Kere U.K. Pentland A.P. Birkedal-Hansen H. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 79-88Google Scholar). Since in vivo cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions have not been apparently altered in chronic and normal wounds, we have suggested that a soluble factor likely induces stromelysin-1 expression by these keratinocytes. Interestingly, the c-Met receptor is more prominently expressed by basal keratinocytes in the wound environment than by those in apparently normal skin. 2H. Sakata, S. J. Stahl, W. G. Taylor, P. T. Wingfield, and J. S. Rubin, unpublished observations. Although HGF/SF did stimulate stromelysin-1 production by keratinocytes, its in vitro effects were greater when the cells were cultured on type I collagen than on Matrigel, a substratum of basement membrane components. This result may reflect the following: 1) inability of Matrigel to adequately duplicate the in vivo composition and/or organization of the basement membrane underlying stromelysin-producing keratinocytes, 2) residual growth factors in the Matrigel preparations that inhibit stromelysin-1 production, or 3) limitations of keratinocyte culture in mimicking all aspects of in vivo wound repair.Specific structural motifs of the HGF/SF molecule are likely to be important in mediating its biological effects. Previous studies suggested that the amino-terminal hairpin loop and the first two kringle domains (K1 and K2) play a significant role in the biological and receptor binding activities of HGF/SF (31Matsumoto K. Takehara T. Inoue H. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 691-699Google Scholar, 32Lokker N.A. Mark M.R. Luis E.A. Bennett G.L. Robbins K.A. Baker J.B.

Godowski P.J. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 895-903Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the ability of three truncated variants of HGF/SF (HGF/N, HGF/NK1, and HGF/NK2) to modulate keratinocyte collagenase-1 production. Our results demonstrated that HGF/NK1 functioned as a partial agonist/antagonist, HGF/NK2 behaved as a pure antagonist, and HGF/N had no significant effects on collagenase-1 production. These data are consistent with the activities of these isoforms in selected mitogenic assays2 (37Chan A.M. Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Hirschfield D.W. Chedid M. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1382-1385Google Scholar, 38Cioce V. Csakky K.G. Chan A.M.-L. Bottaro D.P. Taylor D.P. Jensen W.G.R. Aaronson S.A. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13110-13115Google Scholar). In other systems, however, HGF/NK1 functioned as a pure mitogenic antagonist (35Lokker N.A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17145-17150Google Scholar), and both HGF/NK1 and HGF/NK2 were partial agonists of MDCK scattering (34Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11574-11578Google Scholar, 36Lokker N.A. Presta L.G. Godowski P.J. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 895-903Google Scholar, 38Cioce V. Csakky K.G. Chan A.M.-L. Bottaro D.P. Taylor D.P. Jensen W.G.R. Aaronson S.A. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13110-13115Google Scholar). These contrasting results may be due to differences in assay conditions and/or unique features of the signaling pathways associated with particular cellular responses.Our observations reinforce earlier evidence that the two naturally occurring, truncated HGF/SF isoforms bind to the HGF/SF receptor with a high affinity and are biologically active. Because the essential difference between HGF/NK1 and HGF/NK2 is the presence of the K2 domain in the latter, their distinct effects presumably result from changes in the ligand-receptor interaction attributable to K2. How such changes alter the signaling process leading to the induction of collagenase-1 expression remains to be determined. Nonetheless, given the observation that selected dermal fibroblast preparations exhibit a higher level of HGF/NK2 expression than does HGF/SF and that the ratio of HGF/NK2 to HGF/SF changes upon stimulation (37Chan A.M. Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Hirschfield D.W. Chedid M. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1382-1385Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B), in certain instances HGF/NK2 may function in vivo as a negative regulator of keratinocyte collagenase-1 production.Another extracellular modulator of HGF/SF activity is heparin. Previous work suggested that heparin bound to HGF/SF through interactions with the HGF/N and K2 domains (51Mizuno K. Inoue H. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Nose T. Shimohigashi Y. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1131-1136Google Scholar), although recent studies indicate that the HGF/N domain itself retains the heparin-binding properties of the full-length molecule.2 Heparin inhibits HGF/SF-induced mitogenesis (52Zarnegar R.

In certain assay systems, however, heparin can enhance the mitogenic response to HGF/SF (58Zioncheck T.F. Richardson L. Liu J. Chang L. King K.L. Bennett G.L. Fugedi P. Chamow S.M. Schwall R.H. Stack R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16871-16878Google Scholar). In our experiments, heparin inhibited HGF/SF-induced collagenase-1 production by keratinocytes (Fig. 6). Further investigations are needed to determine if heparin modulates HGF/SF activity by sequestering the growth factor and consequently preventing ligand-receptor interaction, or by altering receptor binding and post-receptor signal transduction through other mechanisms.The biological effects of HGF/SF are thought to be mediated by c-Met (59Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 145-154Google Scholar) and an array of substrates that couple with this tyrosine kinase receptor (60Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Comoglio P.M. J. Biotechnol. 1994; 37: 109-122Google Scholar). In this context, only a few intracellular proteins have been shown to be obligatory for specific cellular responses. For instance, the Ras signaling pathway (61Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Schwarz H. Birchmeier W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21936-21939Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase appear to be required for scattering of MDCK cells (62Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the HGF/SF signal transduction pathway leading to induction of keratinocyte matrix metalloproteinase synthesis is both tyrosine kinase- and protein kinase C-dependent (Fig. 7). These findings are consistent with an earlier report that HGF/SF increases the concentration of intracellular diacylglycerol, an essential cofactor for protein kinase C, through a phospholipase C-dependent pathway (63Osada S. Nakashima S. Saji S. Nakamura T. Nozawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 271-274Google Scholar). Interestingly, collagen induction of collagenase-1 expression is also both tyrosine kinase- and protein kinase C-dependent (21Sudbeck B.D. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Pentland A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30022-30029Google Scholar).HGF/SF stimulation of collagenase production may be important in contexts other than wound healing. Invasion of carcinoma cells into collagen gels is stimulated by HGF/SF, which suggests that this factor might promote tumor metastasis (64Weidner K.M. Behrens J. Vandekerckhove J. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2097-2108Google Scholar). Additionally, NIH/3T3 cells engineered to express an HGF/SF-Met autocrine loop have enhanced invasive and metastatic properties (65Rong S. Segal S. Anver M. Resau J.H. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4731-4735Google Scholar). Interestingly, type I and type IV collagenolytic activities secreted by these transfected fibroblasts were increased approximately 5-10-fold. Among transfectants expressing the autocrine loop, there was a significant correlation between the magnitude of collagenolytic activity and invasiveness. These studies suggest that elevated collagenase levels may be necessary, although not sufficient, for invasiveness (65Rong S. Segal S. Anver M. Resau J.H. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4731-4735Google Scholar). However, it must be recognized that, physiologically, fibroblasts produce HGF/SF but typically do not respond to this growth factor. Nevertheless, identification of the mechanisms responsible for HGF/SF-dependent collagenase induction and reagents capable of inhibiting this process may prove useful in retarding tumor metastasis.In summary, the present study provides evidence at the RNA and protein levels that HGF/SF stimulates matrix metalloproteinase expression by keratinocytes. This effect is highly dependent on the matrix in contact with the cells and is blocked by inhibitors of tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C activity. The naturally occurring truncated isoforms HGF/NK1 and HGF/NK2 act as a partial agonist/antagonist and a pure antagonist, respectively, of HGF/SF-induced collagenase-1 production. The diverse biological effects of HGF/SF suggest several possible physiologic and pathologic roles for the growth factor in the regulation of keratinocyte function. For instance, induction of collagenase-1 synthesis and stimulation of keratinocyte migration may be important and even interrelated in normal wound repair. Alternatively, excessive production of collagenase-1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic nonhealing ulcers or play a role in tumor metastasis.

Recent studies have identified two cis elements, an inverted CCAAT box (ATTGG) and SRE-3, in the proximal promoter of the rat FPP synthase gene that are required for sterol-regulated transcription (10Spear D.H. Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25212-25218Google Scholar, 14Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Mutation of either of these elements, which bind NF-Y and SREBP, respectively, impaired sterol-regulated expression of FPP synthase promoter-reporter genes (10Spear D.H. Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25212-25218Google Scholar, 14Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Google Scholar, 15Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Google Scholar). In addition, co-transfection of a plasmid expressing a dominant-negative form of NF-Y resulted in the impaired regulation of reporter genes driven by promoters derived from either FPP synthase or HMG-CoA synthase (14Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Google Scholar). Consequently, we proposed that NF-Y and SREBP played similar roles in the sterol-regulated transcription of both the HMG-CoA synthase and FPP synthase genes (14Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Google Scholar). NF-Y is a ubiquitous transcription factor that binds as a heterotrimer (NF-YA/NF-YB/NF-YC) to a CCAAT or inverted CCAAT (ATTGG) box (16Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Google Scholar). NF-Y is one of many transcription factors reported to bind to this or closely related sequences (17Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D.J. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Google Scholar). SREBP is also ubiquitously expressed (18Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Google Scholar). It was purified and cloned based on its ability to bind to SRE-1, a 10-base pair sequence, present in the promoters of the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA synthase genes (12Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Google Scholar, 19Wang X. Briggs M.R. Hua X. Yokoyama C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

The increased transcription of the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA synthase genes that occurs in cells deprived of sterols was shown to be dependent, in part, on the interaction of the 68-kDa mature SREBP with SRE-1 (18Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Google Scholar, 19Wang X. Briggs M.R. Hua X. Yokoyama C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14497-14504Google Scholar). The proteolytic release of the mature, transcriptionally active form of SREBP from the 125-kDa precursor SREBP, which is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, is regulated by cellular sterols (21Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar). However, enhanced transcription of the LDL receptor gene required the additional binding of the constitutive transcription factor Sp1 to a DNA sequence adjacent to the SRE-1 (22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Google Scholar). ADD-1 (adipocyte determination- and differentiation-dependent factor 1), the rat homologue of human SREBP, was cloned as a result both of its increased expression during adipocyte differentiation and its ability to recognize an E-box motif (23Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Google Scholar, 24Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.-D. Shih H.-M. Ellenberg T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Google Scholar). This motif has 60% or 50% identity with SRE-1 or SRE-3, respectively (15Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports demonstrate that SREBP/ADD-1 recognizes a number of diverse but related motifs including SRE-1, SRE-3, and an E-box. The current investigations were designed to address the roles of NF-Y and SREBP in sterol-regulated transcription of the FPP synthase gene. We show that the binding of SREBP to SRE-3 in vitro is enhanced significantly when NF-Y is bound to the inverted CCAAT box 20 bp 5′ of the SRE-3 site. In contrast, neither unbound NF-Y nor NF-Y bound to a separate oligonucleotide stimulate the binding of SREBP to SRE-3. These results form the basis for a model to explain how SREBP and NF-Y may interact and synergistically enhance the binding of both proteins to the FPP synthase promoter resulting in enhanced transcription of the gene. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. 32P-Labeled nucleotide triphosphates were obtained from Amersham Corp. pRSETB (Invitrogen) containing both a partial sequence of SREBP-1a (amino acids 1-490) and T7 and polyhistidine tags and pCMV-CSA10, which encodes amino acids 1-490 of SREBP-1a, were kindly provided by Dr. T. Osborne (Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine). Lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum was purchased from PerImmune. Antibodies to human NF-YA and rat CBF-A (homologous to human NF-YB) were generous gifts from Dr. R. Mantovani and Dr. B. de Crombrugghe, respectively. The T7 antibody was from Invitrogen. The sources of all other reagents and plasmids have been given elsewhere (9Spear D.H. Kutsunai S.Y. Correll C.C. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14462-14469Google Scholar, 10Spear D.H.

Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown at 5% CO2 as described previously (10Spear D.H. Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25212-25218Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by either Dr. D. Glitz (Department of Biological Chemistry, UCLA) or Life Technologies, Inc. or were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the FPP synthase promoter-reporter plasmid (pFPPS-0.319 in 9Spear D.H. Kutsunai S.Y. Correll C.C. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14462-14469Google Scholar) as a template. The double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides used in these studies were as follows: a 58-bp probe of the FPP synthase promoter (nucleotides −298 to −241), GCCACCCTTTCA*TTGGCCAGTCGTCACAAGGCCCATACTCACACGAGGTCATTCAGCC containing the inverted CCAAT box (underlined ATTGG) and SRE-3 (double underlined); a similar 58-bp mutant probe, which contained an A → C transversion at nucleotide −287 (*); a 27-bp probe (−298 to −272); and a similar 27-bp probe (−298 to −272), which contained a transversion (A → C) at nucleotide −287 (*). A 62-bp probe, containing nucleotides −298 to −241 and an additional 4-bp insert (AAAA) between −268 and −267, was generated by polymerase chain reaction of a mutant promoter containing these additional 4 nucleotides (see below). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (10Spear D.H. Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25212-25218Google Scholar). Where indicated, crude HeLa nuclear extracts, provided by Dr. M. Carey (UCLA), were separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 (Pharmacia) FPLC column using buffer A (50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Thirty 0.5 ml fractions were collected and stored at −20°C. Recombinant SREBP-1a, containing N-terminal T7 and polyhistidine (His6) tags, was purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli extracts by nickel affinity chromatography as described by Sanchez et al. (22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Google Scholar). Complementary single-stranded DNA, corresponding to the indicated nucleotides of the FPP synthase promoter and containing either the wild-type sequence or the indicated mutations, were annealed, and the double-stranded probe isolated from acrylamide gels (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were generated in the same manner following an initial radiolabeling of a single-stranded oligonucleotide with 32P (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The radiolabeled probes (20,000 cpm; 1.5 fmol) were used in gel mobility shift assays either in the presence of nonfat milk (2.5 mg/ml) as described previously (14Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Google Scholar, 15Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Google Scholar) or in the presence of partially purified NF-Y (5 μg) obtained from HeLa cell nuclei. An NF-Y-enriched nuclear fraction was preincubated for 1 h at 4°C with a preformed Protein A-Sepharose-anti-NF-YA antibody complex. The immunodepleted supernatant, obtained after removal of the Protein A-Sepharose complex, was stored at −70°C. Mock-depleted samples were incubated with Protein A-Sepharose under otherwise identical conditions. The Amersham ECL assay was used to detect NF-Y as described by the supplier. Antibodies to human NF-YA and rat CBF-A were generously supplied by Drs. R. Mantovani and B. de Crombrugghe, respectively. The Sculptor mutagenesis kit (Amersham) was used with single-stranded pFPPS-0.247 (10Spear D.H. Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25212-25218Google Scholar) to generate a mutant promoter containing a 4-bp insert (AAAA) between nucleotides −268 and −267, as described previously (10Spear D.H. Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25212-25218Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant promoters were subcloned into the pGL2 basic vector (Promega) and sequenced to confirm the mutations (9Spear D.H. Kutsunai S.Y. Correll C.C. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

A 53-bp FPP synthase promoter fragment (nucleotides −293 to −241) and a mutant promoter (nucleotides −293 to −241), containing the additional 4-bp insert between −268 and −267, were generated by polymerase chain reaction using wild-type or mutant pFPPS-0.247 as templates. Primers contained restriction sites (HindIII/BamHI) compatible with pTKCIII (15Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Google Scholar). The resultant plasmids (pTKCIII-0.053 and pTKCIII-0.053Ins) were sequenced to confirm the mutation. Details of the transient transfection of CV-1 cells with luciferase or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes, β-galactosidase, and pCMV-CSA10 (encoding SREBP-1a); incubation of the cells in medium supplemented with 10% lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum in the absence (inducing medium) or presence (repressing medium) of sterols (10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol); and subsequent assays of reporter gene activities have been described (14Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Google Scholar, 15Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Google Scholar). The activity of β-galactosidase was used to normalize for transfection efficiencies (15Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Google Scholar). Sterol-regulated transcription of the FPP synthase gene is dependent on the binding of two transcription factors, NF-Y and SREBP-1, to the proximal promoter (14Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Google Scholar, 15Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Google Scholar). We hypothesized that NF-Y might stimulate the binding of SREBP-1 to SRE-3, its cognate binding site. In order to test this hypothesis, we initially used gel mobility shift assays and immunoblots to identify HeLa nuclear fractions, eluted from a size-exclusion column, that were enriched in NF-Y. Polyclonal antibodies raised against human NF-YA (26Mantovani R. Li X.-Y. Pessara U. van Huijsduijnen R.H. Benoist C. Mathis D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Google Scholar) and rat CBF-A (homologous to human NF-YB) (27Coustry F. Maity S.M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Google Scholar) reacted with NF-YB (30 kDa), but not NF-YA (40 kDa) in unfractionated HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 1, right lane). These same antibodies reacted with both subunits of NF-Y in four fractions eluted from the column (Fig. 1, fractions 8-11). Presumably NF-YA was sufficiently enriched in fractions 8-11, as compared to the unfractionated extract, to allow immunodetection. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that fractions 8-11 contained a protein that bound to a 32P-end-labeled probe corresponding to nucleotides −298 to −272 of the FPP synthase promoter but not to a probe containing any mutation in the NF-Y binding site (ATTGG) (data not shown). These NF-Y-enriched fractions (fractions 8-11) were used in subsequent studies. We have used an oligonucleotide, which corresponds to 58 bp of the FPP synthase promoter and contains binding sites for both NF-Y and SREBP, in gel mobility shift assays. Incubation of this 32P end-labeled probe with an NF-Y-enriched fraction resulted in the formation of one major specific complex, consistent with binding of NF-Y to the oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 6). A second, faster migrating, nonspecific complex, which did not contain NF-Y, was also formed in the presence of the NF-Y-enriched fraction (Fig. 2; data not shown). In contrast, recombinant SREBP bound poorly, if at all, to the probe under these gel mobility shift assay conditions (Fig. 2, lane 1). However, addition of SREBP-1, together with the NF-Y-enriched fraction, resulted in the formation of a slower migrating SREBP-NF-Y complex (Fig. 2, lane 7) with a concomitant decrease in the NF-Y complex (Fig. 2, lane 7 versus lane 6). Similar results were obtained when the NF-Y fraction had been mock-depleted of NF-Y (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 6 and 7). In contrast, the NF-Y and SREBP-NF-Y complexes were reduced by greater than 95% when the NF-Y-enriched fraction had been immunodepleted of NF-Y by pretreatment with antibodies to NF-Y (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 6 and 7). The formation of a small amount of the SREBP-NF-Y-DNA complex under these latter conditions (Fig. 2, lane 5) is consistent with synergistic binding and increased affinity of NF-Y and SREBP for the DNA. The SREBP-NF-Y complex observed in lane 7 was supershifted when antibodies to either NF-Y or the T7 tagged SREBP were included in the assay (data not shown), consistent with the presence of both NF-Y and SREBP in the complex. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the >20-fold stimulation of SREBP-1 binding to the SRE-3 sequence within the 58-bp oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, compare lane 1 with the SREBP-NF-Y complex in lane 7) is dependent on NF-Y. We next determined whether the NF-Y-stimulated binding of SREBP to DNA requires both proteins to bind to the same oligonucleotide. Fig. 3 shows that the formation of the SREBP-NF-Y complex was reduced significantly when the gel mobility shift assay was carried out in the presence of an unlabeled 27-bp oligonucleotide containing a single binding site for NF-Y (ATTGG) (Fig. 3, lane 4 versus lane 3). As expected, this competitor oligonucleotide prevented the binding of NF-Y to the radiolabeled probe (compare lanes 4 and 3). In contrast, addition of a 27-bp competitor oligonucleotide containing a point mutation in the NF-Y binding site (ATTGG to CTTGG) had no effect on the formation of either the SREBP-NF-Y complex or NF-Y complex (Fig. 3, lane 5 versus lane 3). We have shown previously that NF-Y does not bind to DNA containing this single A → C mutation in the ATTGG motif (14Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Google Scholar). In the presence of a constant amount of NF-Y, addition of increasing amounts of recombinant SREBP-1a to the 58-bp radiolabeled probe resulted in increased levels of the SREBP-NF-Y complex (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, there was an increase in the level of the SREBP-DNA complex and a decrease in the NF-Y-DNA complex (Fig. 4, lanes 1-4 and 5-7). In contrast, neither the NF-Y nor SREBP-NF-Y complexes were observed when the radiolabeled probe contained a single A → C point mutation within the inverted CCAAT box, the binding site for NF-Y (Fig. 4, lanes 8-11). These studies demonstrated that increased binding of SREBP to the SRE-3 motif did not occur when the NF-Y was present, but not bound to the same oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, lanes 9-11 versus lanes 2-4). Fig. 4 also shows that a 2-fold increase in the NF-Y-enriched fraction, in the presence of a constant amount of SREBP, resulted in a synergistic increase in the formation of the SREBP-NF-Y complex. The relative levels of radioactivity in the SREBP-NF-Y complex in lane 5 versus lane 2, lane 6 versus lane 3, and lane 7 versus lane 4 in Fig. 4 were 5.8, 3.2, and 2.9, respectively. In the absence of NF-Y there was no detectable SREBP-DNA complex (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and data not shown). Thus, we are unable to determine the absolute stimulation of SREBP binding to DNA by NF-Y. The inverted CCAAT box and SRE-3 motif in the FPP synthase promoter are separated by two turns of the DNA helix (20 bp). A direct interaction of NF-Y and SREBP, bound to these motifs on the same oligonucleotide fragment, might be expected to depend on the relative spacing of the two proteins on the DNA. In order to test this hypothesis, we repeated the gel mobility shift assay with an oligonucleotide that contained a 4-bp insert between the inverted CCAAT box and the SRE-3. The formation of the SREBP-NF-Y complex observed in the presence of NF-Y and an increasing amount of SREBP was attenuated when the probe contained the 4-bp insert (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7 versus lanes 3 and 4), consistent with a requirement for specific spacing between the two motifs. In order to determine whether the 4-bp insertion had physiological consequences, FPP synthase promoter-reporter constructs containing either a 247-bp wild-type promoter sequence or the same promoter containing the 4-bp insert between the inverted CCAAT box and SRE-3 were transiently transfected into CV-1 cells. The cells were then incubated in medium depleted of sterols (inducing medium) or in the same medium supplemented with cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol (repressing medium). As expected, expression of the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the wild-type FPP synthase promoter was regulated 4.5-fold under these incubation conditions (Table I). In contrast, expression of the luciferase reporter gene was regulated only 2.0-fold when the FPP synthase promoter contained the 4-bp insert (Table I). This defective regulation of the mutant promoter-luciferase gene resulted largely from a lack of induction when cells were incubated in the inducing medium (Table I). This latter result is consistent with the proposal that the interaction between SREBP and NF-Y is dependent on the exact spacing of the binding sites for the two transcription factors. This proposal was further supported by the data shown in Fig. 6; co-expression of the mature form of SREBP-1a increased CAT activity 5.5-fold when the reporter gene was under the control of the wild-type 53-bp FPP synthase promoter but only 1.4-fold when the promoter contained the 4-bp insert.Table IInsertion of 4bp between the inverted CCAAT box and SRE-3 attenuates sterol-regulated transcription of an FPP synthase promoter-reporter gene constructPlasmidLuciferase activity-Fold regulation− Sterols+ SterolspFPPS-0.2475.0 × 1061.1 × 1064.5pFPPS-0.247Ins1.4 × 1060.7 × 1062.0 Open table in a new tab Mutation of the binding sites for either SREBP or NF-Y in the promoters of FPP synthase (10Spear D.H.

In addition, the increased expression of both reporter genes, which normally occurs when cells are incubated under such inducing conditions, is attenuated when cells are co-transfected with a dominant negative form of NF-YA (14Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Google Scholar). Together, these studies indicate that NF-Y is required for sterol-regulated transcription of both the FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase genes. Insights into the mechanism by which the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y stimulates the transcription of the FPP synthase gene in cells deprived of sterols are provided in the current report. We now demonstrate that binding of the mature form of SREBP to SRE-3 within the FPP synthase promoter is enhanced significantly when NF-Y binds to an inverted CCAAT box located 20 bp upstream of SRE-3. Under these conditions, a major shifted complex comprising both SREBP and NF-Y was observed (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5). In contrast, when NF-Y was not bound to the same DNA fragment, SREBP bound poorly, if at all, to SRE-3 (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5). We conclude that NF-Y, bound to this inverted CCAAT box, plays an important role in the recruitment of mature SREBP to SRE-3 (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5). These results are consistent with the requirement for both NF-Y and mature SREBP for the high levels of transcription of the FPP synthase gene in cells deprived of sterols. Indeed, FPP synthase promoter-reporter constructs that contained mutations in either the inverted CCAAT box or the SRE-3 motif showed attenuated sterol-regulated expression (14Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Google Scholar, 15Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Google Scholar). It is possible that binding of NF-Y and SREBP to DNA results in an altered conformation of the protein(s), increased affinity of the two proteins for each other or a conformational change in the DNA. However, since we have been unable to demonstrate a direct interaction of NF-Y and SREBP in solution, 3J. Ericsson, S. M. Jackson, and P. A. Edwards, unpublished observation. we cannot rule out the possibility that another, as yet unidentified, protein is involved in the formation of the SREBP-NF-Y-DNA complex. The two cis-elements that bind NF-Y and SREBP in the FPP synthase promoter are separated by two turns of the DNA helix (20 bp). Insertion of 4 bp between the inverted CCAAT box and SRE-3 resulted in a decrease both in the binding of SREBP to SRE-3 in vitro (Fig. 5) and the sterol- or SREBP-regulated expression of promoter-reporter genes in vivo (Table I; Fig. 6). These results are consistent with the proposal that the relative spacing of SREBP and NF-Y, bound to the FPP synthase promoter, is important for activation of transcription. A somewhat analogous situation has been described in studies with the LDL receptor gene. The binding of SREBP to SRE-1 in the LDL receptor promoter is not sufficient to stimulate transcription (12Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Google Scholar, 22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Google Scholar). High levels of transcription of the LDL receptor gene require the binding of both SREBP and the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 (22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Google Scholar, 28Sudhof T. Russell D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 1061-1069Google Scholar, 29Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6102-6106Google Scholar). Sanchez et al. have reported that the binding of SREBP to SRE-1 within the proximal LDL receptor promoter stimulates the binding of Sp1 to an adjacent 3′ motif (22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Google Scholar, 29Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6102-6106Google Scholar). The latter motif is a non-consensus Sp1 binding site and represents a relatively weak binding site for this transcription factor. Sanchez et al. also reported that a number of other cis elements are unable to fully functionally substitute for the Sp1 binding site in the LDL receptor promoter (22Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Google Scholar). However, in these latter studies, the effects of either inserting extra base pairs between the Sp1 and SREBP binding sites or replacing the Sp1 binding site with an NF-Y binding site were not determined. Further investigations will be required to ascertain whether NF-Y and Sp1 function interchangeably in different promoters. In this regard, it is noteworthy that NF-YA (30Li X.-Y. van Huijsduijnen R.H. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8984-8990Google Scholar), like Sp1 (31Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 59: 827-836Google Scholar) contains a glutamine-rich activation domain. In contrast, SREBP contains an acidic N terminus that may function as a transactivation domain (32Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Google Scholar). Thus, the synergistic binding of NF-Y and SREBP to the FPP synthase promoter is likely to provide the appropriate activation domains that result in the transcriptional activation of the gene. These same two transcription factors may have important roles in the sterol-regulated transcription of HMG-CoA synthase (11Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Google Scholar, 15Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Google Scholar) and squalene synthase (13Guan G. Jiang G. Koch R.L. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21958-21965Google Scholar). The promoter of the latter gene contains an inverted CCAAT box, an SRE-1 motif, and a motif that has 11/12 identity with the nucleotides of SRE-3. The importance of both the relative orientation and spacing of transcription factor-binding sites in other promoters has recently been investigated; activation of a reporter gene under the control of the T cell receptor α enhancer, which contains binding sites for three distinct transcription factors, was impaired when the binding sites were either switched or separated by extra nucleotides that would be expected to alter the helical phasing of the proteins (33Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirschner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Google Scholar). One of these factors, lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF-1), is known to bind to and induce a sharp bend in the DNA (34Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R. Cell. 1992; 69: 185-195Google Scholar). Such bending of the DNA may be necessary for the subsequent interaction of transcription factors that are not bound adjacently on the DNA and for the interaction of these proteins with the basal transcriptional machinery (35Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 77: 5-8Google Scholar, 36Ptashne M. Gann A.A.F. Science. 1990; 346: 329-331Google Scholar). We are currently investigating whether SREBP causes bending of the DNA, analogous to that observed with LEF-1 and other DNA-binding proteins. We thank Dr. T. Osborne of the University of California, Irvine for providing the plasmids encoding SREBP-1a, Dr. R. Mantovani of the University of Milan for providing antibody to NF-YA and Dr. B. de Crombrugghe of The University of Texas for antibody to CBF-A.

We now present evidence that the phosphodiesterase catalytic site, 201YMRPVYPTKTFPN213, is essential for the motility stimulating activity of autotaxin (ATX), one member of the exophosphodiesterase family. Native ATX possesses phosphodiesterase activity at neutral and alkaline pH, binds ATP noncovalently, and undergoes threonine phosphorylation. Homogeneously purified recombinant ATX, based on the teratocarcinoma sequence, retains these same activities. A single amino acid in the phosphodiesterase catalytic site, Thr210, is found to be necessary for motility stimulation, phosphodiesterase activity, and phosphorylation. Two mutant recombinant proteins, Ala210- and Asp210-ATX, lack motility stimulation and lack both enzymatic activities; Ser210-ATX possesses intermediate activities. Another mutation, with the adjacent lysine (Lys209) changed to Leu209-ATX, possesses normal motility stimulation with sustained phosphodiesterase activity but exhibits no detectable phosphorylation. This mutation eliminates the phosphorylation reaction and indicates that the dephosphorylated state is an active motility-stimulating form of the ATX molecule. By demonstrating that the phosphodiesterase enzymatic site is linked to motility stimulation, these data reveal a novel role for this family of exo/ecto-enzymes and open up the possibility of extracellular enzymatic cascades as a regulatory mechanism for cellular motility.

Autotaxin (ATX), 1The abbreviations used are: ATXautotaxinPDEphosphodiesteraserATXrecombinant ATX. a 125-kDa glycoprotein, was initially isolated from the culture supernatants of a human melanoma cell line (A2058). It has been shown to stimulate random and directed motility of human tumor cells at high picomolar to low nanomolar concentrations (ED50 = ~300-500 pM) (1Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Unsworth E.J. Årestad A. Cioce V. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2524-2529Google Scholar). Production of this autocrine motility factor by a variety of cancer cell types is thought to provide a mechanism for tumor cells to initiate, sustain, and regulate their own motility, a critical feature of the metastatic cascade (2Liotta L.A. Mandler R. Murano G. Katz D.A. Gordon R.K. Chiang P.K. Schiffmann E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3302-3306Google Scholar). The locomotory response to ATX was demonstrated to be sensitive to pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, indicating that a G protein is involved in the signal transduction pathway (1Stracke M.L.

However, little else is known about how this complex protein interacts with tumor cells to stimulate locomotion. autotaxin phosphodiesterase recombinant ATX. When ATX was cloned and sequenced (4Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Google Scholar), its cDNA sequence revealed significant homology to a family of secreted and cell surface proteins that includes a marker of B cell activation (PC-1) (5Buckley M.F. Loveland K.A. McKinstry W.J. Garson O.M. Goding J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17506-17511Google Scholar, 6Funakoshi I. Kato H. Horie K. Yano T. Hori Y. Kobayashi H. Inoue T. Suzuki H. Fukui S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28235-28242Google Scholar), and a rat neural differentiation antigen (gp130RB13-6) (8Deissler H. Lottspeich F. Rajewsky M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9849-9855Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of each of these proteins include two adjacent somatomedin B domains, a type I phosphodiesterase (PDE) active site, and the loop region of an EF hand. PC-1 and gp130RB13-6 are predominantly cell surface glycoproteins with short amino-terminal intracellular regions and single transmembrane domains. ATX is cleaved near its putative transmembrane domain and secreted (4Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Google Scholar). One member of this family, PC-1, has been previously reported to possess both type I PDE/5′-nucleotide pyrophosphatase and threonine-specific kinase activities (9Oda Y. Kuo M.-D. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16791-16795Google Scholar). However, the physiologic function of PC-1 has remained unknown. To date, only ATX has been tested for cell motility. In the present study we describe several enzymatic activities that ATX possesses. We produce mutant recombinant ATXs with changes in the PDE catalytic site and utilize these mutant proteins to explore the relationship between the enzymatic properties and motility stimulation of ATX. The GeneAmp polymerase chain reaction reagent kit with AmpliTaq was purchased from Perkin-Elmer. Restriction endonucleases and SuperScript™ reverse transcriptase were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The 48-well microchemotaxis chambers and the polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes were purchased from NeuroProbe. The human melanoma cell line A2058, originally isolated by Todaro et al. (10Todaro G.J. Fryling C. DeLarco J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5258-5262Google Scholar), was maintained as described previously (2Liotta L.A. Mandler R. Murano G. Katz D.A. Gordon R.K. Chiang P.K. Schiffmann E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3302-3306Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were maintained as described previously (11Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Google Scholar). The production of ATX from 200-liter batches of serum-free conditioned medium of A2058 cells has been described in detail (1Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Unsworth E.J. Årestad A. Cioce V. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2524-2529Google Scholar). In brief, after ammonium sulfate precipitation, the conditioned medium was sequentially fractionated through phenyl-Sepharose CL 4B (Pharmacia-LKB Biotechnology), agarose-bound concanavalin A (Vector Laboratories), and ZORBAX BioSeries-WAX (Mac-Mod) columns. The final pooled active fraction, purified approximately 1000-fold over conditioned medium, was dialyzed into 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol and stored at 5°C. A 2.8-kilobase pair DNA fragment (T9S2A), encoding the entire 863-amino acid teratocarcinoma ATX, was constructed in pCR II™ (Invitrogen Co.) as described previously (12Lee H.Y. Murata J. Clair T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Torres R. Manrow R.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 714-719Google Scholar). The ATX cDNA fragment was excised from pCR II™ by restriction enzyme digestion with HindIII and XbaI. Overhanging ends were filled in with T4 DNA polymerase. Likewise, the expression vector, pBC12BI (11Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Google Scholar), was digested with SmaI and HindIII, and the HindIII overhanging end was filled in. The T9S2A fragment was then blunt-end ligated into the prepared pBC12BI plasmid to produce the vector, pBCT92H. Point mutations were introduced into the PDE active site by utilizing the restriction enzyme MscI, which cuts out a 276-base pair fragment that encodes a portion of ATX extending from the center of the second somatomedin B domain to just distal to the PDE catalytic site. Complementary oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutations as well as the MscI restriction sites were utilized to amplify this fragment by polymerase chain reaction. The mutant ATX cDNA fragment and pBCT92H were each digested with MscI and gel purified. Mutant plasmids were constructed by blunt-end ligating the mutated fragment into the digested pBCT92H plasmid (13Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-66Google Scholar). Each mutant plasmid was sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation and the fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction amplification. COS-1 cells were transfected with pBCT92H or with mutant plasmids using the DEAE-dextran method (11Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Google Scholar). After overnight recovery in complete medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added to the cells, harvested after 48 h, and concentrated using a centriprep-30 ultrafiltration device (Amicon). The control for all experiments was COS-1 cells, transfected with the pBC12BI vector that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes and autoligated. The concentrated supernatants were partially purified by lectin affinity chromatography with concanavalin A-agarose (Vector Laboratories), as described previously in detail (1Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Unsworth E.J. Årestad A. Cioce V. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2524-2529Google Scholar). Concentrations of each recombinant protein were normalized based on the relative optic density of the ATX band on a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were scanned with an ARCUS II scanner (Agfa Corporation), and band density was analyzed utilizing NIH Image (v1.60). The 5′-nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity was measured using the colorimetric method of Razzell (14Razzell W.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2105-2113Google Scholar). The 20-μl ATX sample was added to 80 μl of either 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.9) or 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.3) containing 5 mM p-nitrophenol-TMP (Sigma). After incubation at 37°C for 90 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.1 N NaOH (900 μl). The reaction product was quantified by reading the absorbance at 410 nm. The noncovalent binding of ATP to ATX was detected by photoaffinity labeling (15Haley B.E. Hoffman J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3367-3371Google Scholar). ATX samples were incubated in microtubes containing 100 μM MgCl2, 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.3), and 10 μM of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP (10 Ci/mmol; ICN). After 90 min at 0°C, samples were photoactivated by irradiation at 254 nm for 30 s. Immediately following photolysis, reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of sample buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide minigels (8-16%, Novex), and radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. Phosphorylation of ATX was detected by incubating samples under identical conditions as above but with 10 μM of either [γ-32P]8-azido-ATP (10 Ci/mmol; ICN) or [γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol; ICN). Protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a Tris/glycine buffer system, as described by Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), using prepared 8-16% gradient gels (NOVEX). Prestained molecular weight standards (NOVEX) were run concurrently in order to estimate molecular weights of positive bands. After electrophoretic separation, gels were transferred to Immobilon™ membranes for Western blot analysis (17Brown P.D. Levy A.T. Margulies I.M.K. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6184-6191Google Scholar, 18Margulies I.M.K. Höyhtyä M. Evans C. Stracke M.L. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 1992; 1: 467-474Google Scholar). Immunoblots utilized affinity-purified anti-ATX 103 peptide (1:200) as primary antibody (4Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Google Scholar) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:50,000) as secondary antibody (Pierce). The blot was treated with ECL reagents using the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Life Sciences), exposed to Hyperfilm-ECL for 0.5-5 min and then developed in an X-Omat film developer. In order to detect phosphoamino acids, phosphorylated ATX was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide (8-16%) gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon™ membrane as described for immunoblots. The phospho-ATX was detected by autoradiography, excised, and acid hydrolyzed in 5.6 N HCl (19Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Google Scholar, 20Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Google Scholar). The sample was applied to a SilicaGel 60 Å thin layer chromatography plate (Whatman Instruments, Ltd.). Phosphoamino acids were separated first in 1.3 N acetic acid and 0.5 N formic acid and then in 0.8 N acetic acid and 0.5% (v/v) pyridine. The identity of the ATX phosphoamino acids was detected by autoradiography. Phosphoamino acid standards (phosphothreonine, phosphoserine, and phosphotyrosine) were applied concurrently to the same plate and detected by spraying with 0.3% (w/v) ninhydrin in acetone. Motility assays were performed in triplicate using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber as described previously in detail (3Stracke M.L. Guirguis R. Liotta L.A. Schiffmann E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 339-345Google Scholar, 21Stracke M.L. Engel J.D. Wilson L.W. Rechler M.M. Liotta L.A. Schiffmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21544-21549Google Scholar). Gelatin-coated Nuclepore membranes used in these modified Boyden chambers were fixed and stained using Diff-Quik reagents (American Scientific Products). Chemotaxis was quantitated by counting five randomly chosen high power fields under light microscopy (400×) for each replicate. ATX had been previously found to have type I PDE activity (4Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Google Scholar). Under conditions of excess type I PDE substrate (p-nitrophenyl-TMP), we compared this activity at alkaline pH (8.9) versus neutral pH (7.3). Although ATX hydrolyzed substrate at either pH, the activity was 3-4-fold higher at alkaline pH (Fig. 1A). Based on the homology with PC-1, we next characterized the interaction of ATX with ATP, utilizing the photoaffinity label, 8-azido-ATP. Autoradiographs of ATX after incubation with [α-32P]8-azido-ATP revealed radiolabeled ATX only after photoactivation (Fig. 1B, hν+), indicating both that ATX bound ATP and that this binding was noncovalent. In contrast, ATX incubated with [γ-32P]8-azido-ATP was radiolabeled with (hν+) or without (hν−) photoactivation (Fig. 1B), indicating that the γ phosphate group is covalently transferred to the protein. Separation of the phosphoamino acids of gel-purified ATX by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography demonstrated the phosphorylation of threonine but not that of serine or tyrosine (Fig. 1C). A full-length ATX cDNA clone from the human teratocarcinoma cell line Ntera2D1 was isolated, and the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity as determined by silver stain (Fig. 2B, lane 1). This clone is >99% identical to the A2058 clone at both the cDNA and the protein level except for a single 52-amino acid insert found only in the A2058 ATX (12Lee H.Y. Murata J. Clair T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Torres R. Manrow R.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 714-719Google Scholar). When rATX was compared with A2058 ATX by Western blot, both reacted with ATX-103 (4Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Google Scholar) anti-peptide antibody (Fig. 2A). The empty vector-transfected COS-1 cells did not secrete a cross-reactive protein. The rATX protein possessed PDE activity (data not shown) and was phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2B, lane 2). In addition, rATX stimulated tumor cell motility at concentrations equivalent (4Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Google Scholar) to those of native ATX (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that the recombinant protein has activities identical to native ATX. The amino acid sequence of the rATX PDE active site (201YMRPVYPTKTFPN213) is identical to that of both the A2058 and the Ntera2D1 proteins (presumably wild type). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we introduced mutations into the cDNA sequence that altered this active site amino acid sequence. Based on the homology to the active site of bovine intestinal alkaline PDE, Thr210 was presumed to be necessary for the formation of an active intermediate (22Culp J.S. Blytt H.J. Hermodson M. Butler L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8320-8324Google Scholar). This equivalent threonine has also been shown to be phosphorylated in PC-1 and to be required for both 5′-nucleotide PDE and phosphorylation activities (23Oda Y. Kuo M.-D. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27318-27326Google Scholar, 24Belli S.I. Mercuri F.A. Sali A. Goding J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 669-676Google Scholar). We therefore mutated this locus into an alanine (Ala210-rATX), a phosphorylatable serine (Ser210-rATX), or a negatively charged aspartic acid (Asp210-rATX), which has been demonstrated to mimic the phosphorylated state (25Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Google Scholar). The positively charged Lys209 was mutated into a neutral leucine (Leu209-rATX). Another point mutation resulted in the replacement of Tyr201 with a histidine (His201-rATX). Finally, knowing that native ATX is phosphorylated on threonine, we also mutated Thr208 into a valine (Val208-rATX). The seven cDNA constructs were transfected into COS-1 cells; cells transfected by autoligated vector alone (V) served as control. Immunoblots revealed that the mutant autotaxins were expressed and that all reacted with anti-peptide antibody (Fig. 3A). Assessment of type I PDE activities demonstrated that the Ala210-rATX and Asp210-rATX mutants had greatly reduced enzymatic activity compared with wild type rATX or Val208-rATX (Fig. 3B and Table I). The Ser210-rATX, Leu209-rATX, and His201-rATX mutants were intermediate in activity, having ~17, ~61, and ~77% of the activity of rATX, respectively. Utilizing radiolabeled 8-azido-ATP to determine the effect of these mutations on ATP binding, we found that [α-32P]8-azido-ATP bound the seven rATX constructs only after photoactivation, indicating that none of these point mutations significantly altered the noncovalent ATP binding to ATX (Fig. 3C and Table I). Phosphorylation of the ATX mutants (Fig. 3D) was tested with [γ-32P]ATP. The Ala210-rATX, Asp210-rATX, and Leu209-rATX mutants failed to be phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of Ser210-rATX was marginal, varying from undetectable to <10% of wild type rATX. His201-rATX and Val208-rATX (Table I) demonstrated phosphorylation identical to that of rATX. These data indicate that a phosphorylatable amino acid in position 210 (Thr210 > Ser210) is required for the PDE activity of ATX. The cationic Lys209 is important for phosphorylation but not for significant PDE activity. None of the introduced mutations affected ATP binding.Table I.Comparison of different ATX constructs with changes in the phosphodiesterase active siteMutantSequencePDE activitya+Indicates >90% of wild type activity. − means not significantly different from vector-transfected control.Phosphorylationa+Indicates >90% of wild type activity. − means not significantly different from vector-transfected control.ATP bindinga+Indicates >90% of wild type activity. − means not significantly different from vector-transfected control.Motilitya+Indicates >90% of wild type activity. − means not significantly different from vector-transfected control.rATX (wild)YMRPVYPTKTFPN++++H201-rATXHMRPVYPTKTFPNLowbCleavage of p-nitrophenol-TMP was quantitated by measuring absorption at wavelength 410 nm on a Beckman DU-600 spectrophotometer.

Open table in a new tab In order to determine what role the PDE active site might play in the capacity of autotaxin to stimulate motility, we utilized each construct as attractant in concurrent chemotaxis assays. Motility stimulation by His201-rATX, Val208-rATX, and Leu209-rATX is equivalent to that of wild type rATX, i.e. at least 3-5-fold increased over background (Fig. 4 and Table I). Both the Ala210-rATX (n = 9) and the Asp210-rATX (n = 3) mutants failed to stimulate motility statistically above empty vector-transfected cell supernatants. In contrast, the Ser210-rATX mutant possessed intermediate motility-stimulating capacity (24-47% of rATX activity, n = 5). These data indicate that the relationship between motility stimulation and PDE activity is complex. Mutants that lacked PDE activity also lacked motility stimulation, and the Ser210-rATX mutant was clearly intermediate with respect to both activities. However, the association between the activities is nonlinear because both the His201- and Leu209-rATX mutants had full motility-stimulating capacity with less PDE activity than wild type ATX. The data are consistent with PDE activity above a certain threshold being necessary for full motility stimulation. ATX is a tumor cell motility-stimulating factor that was originally purified from melanoma cell supernatants. We have now demonstrated that ATX also has multiple nucleotide-processing activities, including ATP binding, phosphorylation, and type I PDE activity. Recombinant ATX, with sequence based on the teratocarcinoma protein (12Lee H.Y. Murata J. Clair T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Torres R. Manrow R.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 714-719Google Scholar), retains all of these activities, including motility-stimulating capacity. We have utilized site-directed mutagenesis to genetically alter the PDE catalytic site and tested the resulting mutant rATXs for each of the known activities. Changing a single amino acid within this site, Thr210, into either alanine or aspartate resulted in loss of phosphorylation, loss of PDE activity, and abolishment of motility stimulation. These data demonstrated that the catalytic site of ATX is necessary for its motility-stimulating activity. A different mutant ATX, with Lys209 changed to leucine, possessed normal motility-stimulating capacity, slightly reduced PDE activity, and no phosphorylation. This mutation allowed us to isolate the phosphorylation reaction and strongly suggested that the dephosphorylated state is an active, motility-stimulating form of the molecule. The fact that ATX possessed a series of nucleotide-processing activities is consistent with its homology to PC-1 and other 5′ nucleotide PDEs (12Lee H.Y. Murata J. Clair T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Torres R. Manrow R.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 714-719Google Scholar). PC-1 was first identified as a cell surface antigen associated with terminally differentiated B lymphocytes and plasma cells (26Takahashi T. Old L.J. Boyse E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 131: 1325-1341Google Scholar). The intact cell surface protein was found to possess nucleotide pyrophosphatase/type I PDE activity (27Rebbe N.F. Tong B.D. Finley E.M. Hickman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5192-5196Google Scholar). PC-1 also reported to possess threonine-specific kinase activity and to undergo autophosphorylation (9Oda Y. Kuo M.-D. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16791-16795Google Scholar). However, Belli et al. (24Belli S.I. Mercuri F.A. Sali A. Goding J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 669-676Google Scholar), utilizing COS-7 cells transfected with wild type or mutant PC-1, found no additional substrates for PC-1 phosphorylation except itself. Recently, PC-1 has been found to be over-expressed in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (28Maddux B.A. Sbraccia P. Kumakura S. Sasson S. Youngren J. Fisher A. Spencer S. Grupe A. Henzel W. Stewart T.A. Reaves G.M. Goldfine I.D. Nature. 1995; 373: 448-451Google Scholar). Transfection of PC-1 into MCF-7 cells resulted in marked inhibition of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity without affecting insulin binding to its receptor (28Maddux B.A. Sbraccia P. Kumakura S. Sasson S. Youngren J. Fisher A. Spencer S. Grupe A. Henzel W. Stewart T.A. Reaves G.M. Goldfine I.D. Nature. 1995; 373: 448-451Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells, transfected with mutant PC-1 that lacked PDE activity, inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity just as effectively as cells transfected with wild type PC-1 (29Grupe A. Alleman J. Goldfine I.D. Sadick M. Stewart T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 94: 560-567Google Scholar). Thus, unlike the ATX stimulation of motility, the PC-1 inhibition of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity does not appear to depend on an intact PDE catalytic site. The rat neural differentiation cell surface antigen gp130RB13-6 was initially isolated from rat fetal brain by utilizing a monoclonal antibody produced against a subpopulation of prenatal BDIX rat brain cells (8Deissler H. Lottspeich F. Rajewsky M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9849-9855Google Scholar, 30Kindler-Rohrborn A. Ahrens O. Liepelt U. Rajewsky M.F. Differentiation. 1985; 30: 53-60Google Scholar). This same monoclonal antibody was also found to react with several primary brain tumors and brain tumor cell lines that had been induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (31Kindler-Rohrborn A. Blass-Kampmann S. Lennartz K. Liepelt U. Minwegen R. Rajewsky M.F. Differentiation. 1994; 57: 215-224Google Scholar). Gp130RB13-6, related to both ATX and PC-1, has recently been shown to possess 5′-nucleotide PDE I activity (8Deissler H. Lottspeich F. Rajewsky M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9849-9855Google Scholar). Although nucleotides have a well established role in intracellular metabolism, ATP and other nucleotides also have important extracellular roles in receptor-mediated signal transduction (32Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Google Scholar, 33Chen Z.-P. Levy A. Lightman S.L. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 83-96Google Scholar). Extracellular or cell surface proteins capable of binding ATP and hydrolyzing phosphoester bonds of nucleotides are known to exist, but their function has remained obscure. Data from studies with PC-1 and gp130RB13-6 have suggested that cell surface PDEs may play roles in cellular differentiation. Our data have revealed a structure-function correlation between the PDE catalytic site and motility stimulation by ATX, indicating a biologically important functional role for the ecto/exophosphodiesterases in the stimulation of cellular motility. As an enzyme, ATX may stimulate motility directly through a cell surface receptor or indirectly through one of its enzymatic products. Based on our data, possible mechanisms of activity include the following: 1) the PDE catalytic site and its influence on the conformation of ATX may be required for binding or processing a cell surface receptor; 2) the nucleotide products of the enzymatic reaction may stimulate motility; or 3) the products of an unknown phosphorylated substrate may stimulate motility. We are now in the process of distinguishing these possibilities."

We have examined the consequences of CGG repeat expansion and methylation for nucleosome assembly and positioning on the Fragile X Mental Retardation gene 1(FMR1) gene. Short unmethylated CGG repeats are not particularly favored in terms of affinity for the histone octamer or for positioning of the reconstituted nucleosome. However, upon methylation their affinity for the histone octamer increases and a highly positioned nucleosome assembles with the repeat sequences found adjacent to the nucleosomal dyad. Expansion of these CGG repeats abolishes the preferential nucleosome assembly due to methylation. Thus, the expansion and methylation of these triplet repeats can alter the functional organization of chromatin, which may contribute to alterations in the expression of the FMR1 gene and the disease phenotype.

Holman K. Baker E. Warren S.T. Schlessinger D. Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Science. 1991; 252: 1711-1718Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for expansion of CGG repeats, their selective methylation, transcriptional repression dependent on expansion, and chromosomal fragility have not been determined. It is possible that alterations to chromatin structure associated with the CGG repeats might contribute to these various phenomena (17Wolffe A.P. Am. Sci. Med. 1995; 2: 68-77Google Scholar, 18Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2875-2878Google Scholar). Expansions of the CTG repeat sequences associated with a range of other inherited human diseases (19Bates G. Lehrach H. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 277-284Google Scholar) lead to alterations in chromatin structure in vivo (20Otten A.D. Tapscott S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5465-5469Google Scholar) and the assembly of nucleosomes of unusually high stability (21Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Google Scholar, 22Wang Y.-H. Amirhaeri S.

Evidence exists for the assembly of specialized chromatin structures on methylated DNA (24Keshet I. Lieman-Hurwitz J. Cedar H. Cell. 1986; 44: 535-543Google Scholar). H1 is enriched in nucleosomes that contain 5-methylcytosine in vivo (25Ball D.J. Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5490-5494Google Scholar). However, no differences have been detected for H1 binding to methylated DNA versus unmethylated DNA in reconstituted chromatin (26Campoy F.J. Meehan R.R. McKay S. Nixon J. Bird A. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, sequence-specific methylation-dependent binding of linker histones (30Levine A. Yeivin A. Ben-Asher E. Aloni Y. Razin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 268: 21754-21759Google Scholar, 31McArthur M. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1705-1714Google Scholar) and core histones (32Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Google Scholar) to particular DNA sequences can occur. In this work we demonstrate that methylation of 13 CGG repeats associated with the FMR1 promoter in a normal individual increases the affinity of the histone octamer for a DNA sequence containing these repeats. Our results suggest that short segments of methylated CGG triplet repeats have similar properties to CTG sequences in that they are highly favored binding sites for the histone octamer (23Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Google Scholar), but that expansion of these triplet repeats leads to marked differences in their association with the core histones. Plasmids containing a portion of the human FMR1 gene were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of patient DNA and contained the 252-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s). fragment of the gene including 13 repeats of CGG (i.e. normal range) (Fig. 1). This region was cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript(KS−) vector (Stratagene); the plasmid incorporating this fragment is referred to as pCGG13. Another fragment, which was amplified, using the same primers, from a Fragile X patient, contained 74 CGG repeats; this was cloned into the EcoRI site of vector pSV2neo (Clontech) and is referred to as pCGG74. Plasmid pCTG10 was as described previously (23Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Google Scholar). The Xenopus borealis somatic 5 S RNA gene was contained in plasmid XP-10 (33Wolffe A.P. Jordan E. Brown D.D. Cell. 1986; 44: 381-389Google Scholar). base pair(s). Ten μg of plasmid DNA was incubated with 10 units of SssI methylase (New England Biolabs) in the supplied buffer for 16 h at 37°C in a volume of 50 μl. Methyl group donor S-adenosyl methionine was used at 160 mM. SDS and EDTA were added to final concentrations of 0.5% and 5 mM, respectively, to stop the reaction. Plasmids were cut with the indicated restriction enzymes, labeled using the Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), and the appropriate fragments were isolated from gels. Reconstitution of nucleosome cores under competitive conditions were as described (34Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleosome core particles used for footprinting were formed by exchange reactions as described previously (23Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radical reactions have been detailed previously (35Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Methods Mol.

DNA (0.5 mg) from methylated pCGG13 was cut with BamHI and PstI to liberate a 252-bp fragment. This was resolved by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and recovered by electroelution of the gel slice in dialysis tubing. This was used to reconstitute nucleosomes by dialysis (36Camerini-Otero R.D. Sollner-Webb B. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1976; 8: 333-347Google Scholar). Histones were purified from HeLa cells (37O'Neill T.E. Roberge M. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 67-78Google Scholar) and were used at a ratio of 0.8 mg of histones/1 mg of DNA. Modifications to salt dialysis and subsequent micrococcal nuclease digestion were as described (23Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Google Scholar). The resulting fragments were end-labeled with 32P using polynucleotide kinase and resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel for isolation of the 146-bp band. Isolated DNA was cut with restriction enzymes as indicated and resolved on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel for analysis. We have shown previously that the Xenopus histone H4 gene is one of the strongest known naturally occurring nucleosome positioning sequences (23Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Google Scholar). This gene contains two closely spaced runs of triplet repeats, CGG7 and CTG6. We sought to investigate the positioning capabilities, if any, of the CGG repeats in a different system where they would not be influenced by adjacent CTG tracts. We chose the human FMR1 gene, which contains between 6 and 60 repeats of the CGG trinucleotide in normal individuals juxtaposed to the promoter elements of the gene (Fig. 1; see also 38Hirst M.

Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Google Scholar). This involves an exchange reaction from purified donor chromatin onto the labeled fragment of interest in the presence of cold competitor DNA. The X. borealis somatic 5 S rRNA gene has typically been used as a standard sequence favored for association with the histone octamer (39Hayes J.J. Bashkin J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8434-8440Google Scholar, 40Schild C. Claret F.-X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Google Scholar). We and others have more recently described the very high affinity for histone octamers that DNA sequences containing CTG triplet repeats possess (21Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Google Scholar, 22Wang Y.-H. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. Science. 1995; 265: 669-671Google Scholar, 23Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Google Scholar). We therefore made use of both the 5 S RNA gene and the human DRPLA (dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy) gene, which contains 10 CTG repeats, as standards in the competitive nucleosome reconstitution assay. It can be seen that the FMR1 gene containing 13 CGG repeats does not have a strong affinity for histone octamers relative to the human DRPLA gene and Xenopus 5 S rRNA gene (Fig. 2, Table I). We then methylated the FMR1 gene using a commercially available prokaryotic methylase (SssI), which adds a methyl group to cytosine residues. This modification can be seen to have a pronounced effect on the overall affinity of the sequence containing the CGG repeats for the histone octamer (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 3). This effect is at least 3-fold when comparing a ratio of nucleosomal DNA to free DNA and accounts for a change in relative free energy of formation (ΔΔG) between 0.6 and 0.7 kcal/mol (Table I). Methylation of the CGG repeats causes the degree of affinity for the histone octamer to increase to a level nearly identical to a comparable sized run of CTG trinucleotides in the DRPLA gene (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 4).Table IComparative free energies in nucleosome formationDNAFree energycal/molMononucleosomal DNA0CGG13−1578 ± 49CGG13 (methylated)−2161 ± 66CGG74−1664 ± 30CGG74 (methylated)−501 ± 79CTG10−2243 ± 695 S RNA gene−1750 ± 59 Open table in a new tab We next examined the binding of a histone octamer to a FMR1 gene fragment containing expanded methylated CGG triplets (CmGG). We used a clone that contained 74 repeats, isolated from a carrier of the Fragile X syndrome. The unmethylated DNA was used in nucleosome reconstitution experiments and was found to form nucleosomes with an efficiency nearly identical to the unmethylated, unexpanded gene (Fig. 2, lane 6; Table I). The multiple species resolved on the polyacrylamide gel suggest the existence of distinct translational positions of the histone octamer with respect to the DNA sequence containing the 74 CGG triplets (41Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Google Scholar and 42Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Google Scholar; see below). Upon methylation, however, the affinity of the expanded fragment for the histone octamer drops off sharply in contrast to the behavior exhibited by the normal-sized CmGG repeat (Fig. 2, lane 5). This decrease is on the scale of an entire kilocalorie of free energy (Table I). Note that in Fig. 2 (lanes 5 and 6), both experiments with the expanded fragment were performed in the absence of competitor DNA in order to highlight the difference between the methylated and unmethylated CGG74. The free energies of nucleosome formation for this sequence in methylated or unmethylated form were calculated from experiments done in parallel with the unexpanded fragments in the presence of competitor (data not shown). Thus methylation of the CGG repeats can have differing effects on nucleosome formation, dependent on the repeat number. We studied the precise nucleosome positioning capabilities of the normal range CmGG repeat in addition to the overall affinity of the sequence for histone octamers. The rotational settings of DNA on the surface of the histone octamer within the reconstituted nucleosomes were examined using hydroxyl radical cleavage (39Hayes J.J. Bashkin J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8434-8440Google Scholar). A clear, 10-11bp repeat is apparent over the CmGG repeat of the FMR1 gene upon cleavage by hydroxyl radical (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5 and 6). This pattern is also present for a distance both upstream and downstream of the repeats and is indicative of rotational positioning of DNA on the surface of the histone octamer. Rotational positioning of DNA is less evident upon cleavage of the nucleosomes reconstituted on the unmethylated DNA fragment (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2 and 3). The relative modulation of periodicity in hydroxyl radical cleavage can be better seen for the nucleosomes assembled on methylated and unmethylated DNA by densitometric scanning (Fig. 4A). The 10-11-bp periodicity in hydroxyl radical cleavage is clearly enhanced within nucleosomes once the DNA sequence is methylated. Comparison of hydroxyl radical cleavage of either methylated or unmethylated naked DNA reveals little change in cleavage pattern. This suggests that aspects of intrinsic DNA structure detected by hydroxyl radicals such as minor groove width (43Burkhoff A.M. Tullius T.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 935-943Google Scholar, 44Burkhoff A.M. Tullius T.D. Nature. 1988; 331: 455-457Google Scholar) are unchanged by DNA methylation.Fig. 4Densitometer tracings of FMR1 gene footprints. Figure shows line graphs of the data contained in Fig. 3. An open box representing the area of CTG repeats is marked. Marker denotes the G-reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined the translational positioning of the histone octamer relative to the FMR1 gene. The translational position of a histone octamer with respect to DNA sequence can be determined by reconstitution using unlabeled DNA and digestion with micrococcal nuclease (45Dong F. Hansen J.C. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 87: 5724-5728Google Scholar, 46Dong F. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10596-10600Google Scholar). Cleavage of DNA isolated from reconstituted nucleosomes with two enzymes, XhoI and BstNI, revealed only two possible nucleosome positions on the methylated DNA fragment (Fig. 5). These positions differ from each other by approximately 3 bp, and are thus quite similar. These positions place the last “G” of the CmGG repeat at (or 3 bp away from) the nucleosome dyad. This is consistent with the nucleosome position found for the CTG trinucleotides in the Xenopus histone H4 gene (23Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Google Scholar). This arrangement would initially place one edge of the nucleosome 100 bp downstream of the start site of transcription of the human FMR1 gene (47Hwu W.L. Lee Y.M. Lee S.C. Wang T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 324-329Google Scholar and Fig. 1). In contrast to these results with the methylated CGG13 repeat, translational mapping of the histone octamer using the unmethylated CGG13 repeat did not give a limited number of specific DNA fragments on restriction endonuclease digestion (data not shown). This result supports the presence of multiple translational positions for the histone octamer with respect to DNA sequence. These results lead to the conclusion that the methylated CGG13 repeat has similar structural properties to short CTG repeats (6-10 repetitions). Both of these short repeat sequences greatly favor association with the histone octamer (Fig. 2, Table I), they translationally position the octamer with the repeat sequence adjacent to the nucleosomal dyad, and contribute to the rotational positioning of DNA on the surface of the histone octamer (Figs. 3, 4, 5; 23Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Google Scholar). The expanded CTG repeats as found in individuals affected by myotonic dystrophy retain an elevated affinity of DNA for the histone octamer and are still capable of translational and rotational positioning of DNA sequence with respect to the histone octamer (21Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Google Scholar, 22Wang Y.-H. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. Science. 1995; 265: 669-671Google Scholar, 23Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15222-15229Google Scholar). In contrast, the expanded CGG repeats do not have a high affinity for histone octamers in the presence or absence of methylation (Table I). Hydroxyl radical cleavage of nucleosomes assembled to include expanded CGG repeats provides no evidence for rotational positioning of DNA within these reconstituted nucleosomes (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Nor is there any evidence for translational positioning of the histone octamer with respect to DNA sequence (data not shown). These results indicate that nucleosomes assembled on the expanded CGG repeats are similar in stability to those that include the general mixture of DNA sequences associated with histones in the nucleus (Table I, mononucleosomal DNA). We conclude that methylation of unexpanded CGG repeat sequences has a significant influence on the association of core histones with DNA. This result suggests that short methylated CGG repeats and CTG repeats might possess structural features in chromatin that contribute to a tendency toward expansion. A reduction in the processivity of DNA polymerase as a consequence of stable histone-DNA interactions might facilitate the expansion of triplet repeats (48Gacy A.M. Goellner G. Juranic N. Macura S. McMurray C.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 533-540Google Scholar). The presence of a stable nucleosome immediately downstream of the start site of transcription of the FMR1 gene might also contribute to the regulation of gene expression at this promoter. Nucleosomes are known to impede the processivity of RNA polymerase II and to potentially contribute to the regulation of transcription downstream from the start site of transcription (49Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Google Scholar, 50Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2051693472,"In this study, we describe the establishment of a stably transfected epithelial cell line with the cDNA for the rat aquaporin 2 (AQP2). To this end, we used a human cell line (HCD) derived from the cortical collecting duct and having characteristics of principal cells (Prié, D., Friedlander, G., Coureau, C., Vandewalle, A., Cassigena, R., and Ronco, P. M. (1995) Kidney Int. 47, 1310-1318). The HCD cells were first screened for the constitutive expression of AQPs. By Western blot analysis, we found a low expression of immunoreactive AQP2 and AQP4 proteins. In contrast, transfected cells (clone CD8) probed with AQP2 antiserum expressed an intense 29-kDa protein on immunoblot in addition to a broad band between 35-45 kDa corresponding to the glycosylated form of the protein, indicating that full maturity of the protein is attained in transfected cells. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that AQP2 was located in intracellular vesicles. After vasopressin stimulation, the staining redistributed from an intracellular site to the apical pole of the cells, an effect similar to that described on collecting duct principal cells in vivo (Sabolic, I., Katsura, T., Verbavatz, J. M., and Brown, D. (1995) J. Membr. Biol. 143, 165-175) and in perfused tubules (Nielsen, S., Chou, C. L., Marples, D., Christensen, E. I., Kishore, B. K., and Knepper, M. A. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 1013-1017).The redistribution of AQP2 in CD8 cells was accompanied by an approximately 6-fold increase in osmotic water permeability coefficient (Pf), which was inhibited by 0.3 mM HgCl2. These data indicate that functional vasopressin-sensitive water channels are expressed in transfected cells. The stably transfected cells represent a suitable model to unravel by direct experimental approach the intracellular signals involved in the translocation of AQP2 to the apical plasma membrane in the presence of vasopressin.

INTRODUCTIONThe mammalian kidney plays the principal role in the regulation of water balance. The coordinate function of different portions of the renal tubule allows the nephron to accomplish this task. Insight into mechanisms underlying kidney water transport physiology is principally based on experiments performed on a microperfused portion of the nephron (4Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C837-C850Google Scholar). In humans, indirect data can be provided by clearance studies (5Chabardes D. Gagnan-Brunette M. Imbert-Teboul M. Gontcharevskaia O. Montegut M. Clique A. Morel F. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 439-448Google Scholar), but it is difficult to evaluate the individual role of a specific nephron segment. During the last 3 years, it became clear that different segments of the nephron express homologous proteins, the aquaporin (AQP) 1The abbreviations used are: AQPaquaporinhAQPhuman AQPrAQPrat AQPPBSphosphate-buffered salineTIRtotal internal reflection microfluorimetry. water channels, endowed with the apparently similar function of water transport (6Agre P. Brown D. Nielsen S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 472-483Google Scholar), which makes it difficult to extrapolate the contribution of a particular water channel in the overall function of the tubule.Heavy expression of AQP1 in both apical and basolateral membranes of proximal tubule and descending limb was found (7Sabolic I. Valenti G. Verbavatz J.M. Van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1225-C1233Google Scholar, 8Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 371-383Google Scholar). Those segments of the nephron possess a high constitutive water permeability that accounts for the nearly isotonic water reabsorption of up to 70% of glomerular filtrate. Three aquaporins are expressed in collecting duct principal cells: AQP2, AQP3, and AQP4. AQP2 is predominantly localized to the apical plasma membrane and subapical vesicles of the collecting duct principal cells (9Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Nature. 1993; 361: 549-552Google Scholar, 10Nielsen S. DiGiovanni S.R. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Harris H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11663-11667Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that AQP2 is the vasopressin-regulated water channel. Studies on isolated perfused tubules have demonstrated that regulation of collecting duct water permeability by vasopressin occurs through the translocation of AQP2 water channels from intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane (3Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Google Scholar). AQP3 and AQP4 are found in the basolateral membrane of collecting duct principal cells (11Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y.

Ecelbarger C.A. Marples D. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F775-F785Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the expression of homologous proteins having the same apparent function to transport water is still unexplained. Because of the complexity of the overall organization of the water transport regulation in the renal tubules, the availability of a cell culture system in which a pathway for water channels is retained “in vitro” would provide a powerful cellular tool for physiological studies.Recently, the establishment of the first human cell line deriving from cortical collecting duct (HCD) has been described (1Prié D. Friedlander G. Coureau C. Vandewalle A. Cassigena R. Ronco P.M. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1310-1318Google Scholar). HCD is a polarized epithelial cell line immortalized by SV40 virus and expressing principal cell characteristics. Cells are sensitive to vasopressin which strongly stimulates intracellular cAMP production. In addition, HCD cells express both A1 and A2 receptors for adenosine which have been demonstrated to modulate water reabsorption in the rabbit cortical collecting duct (18Dillingham M.A. Anderson R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 88: 277-281Google Scholar). In an attempt to search for a valuable cell culture system to study the cell biology of water channels, we tested the expression of members of the aquaporin family in HCD cells. Our findings demonstrate that HCD is the first cell line in which the AQP2 and AQP4 are constitutively expressed, although in a very low amount. In order to make this cell line suitable for cell biology studies of vasopressin-regulated water channel, HCD cells were stably transfected to overexpress AQP2. Transfected cells probed with AQP2 antiserum, intensely expressed a 29-kDa protein on immunoblot in addition to a broad band between 35 and 45 kDa which corresponds to the glycosylated form of the AQP2 protein. In addition, our results show that AQP2 is redistributed from an intracellular site to the apical pole of the cells after vasopressin stimulation and this effect is accompanied by a dramatic increase of the osmotic water permeability coefficient. These data suggest that transfected cells represent an interesting cell culture model for studying water channel biology.DISCUSSIONVasopressin is the principal hormone that regulates the water balance through a modulation of water reabsorption in the kidney. Much effort is now devoted to clarify the complex cellular machinery involved in the targeting of AQP2 from an intracellular site to the apical plasma membrane after vasopressin stimulation. Cell cultures are useful tools to unravel the mechanism of epithelial transport and hormonal regulation at cellular and molecular levels. The homogeneity of cell cultures is a definite advantage for studies of hormone interaction with receptors coupling to triggering steps that transduce the hormonal signal to an intracellular signal. An interesting cell culture model of vasopressin-stimulated water permeability has been reported recently (29Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells were stably transfected with cDNA encoding AQP2 tagged with a COOH-terminal c-Myc epitope. Interestingly, in those cells, AQP2 recycling between intracellular vesicles and the plasma membrane was observed. However, the authors reported a mis-sorting of the expressed AQP2 to the basolateral membrane. They postulated that the c-Myc-tagged AQP2 could be responsible for this behavior.The aim of this study was to establish an epithelial cell line that would stably express large quantities of functional AQP2 in the setting of a principal cell phenotype to be useful for identification of intracellular signals involved in the targeting of the AQP2 water channel to the plasma membrane. To this end, we selected HCD cells, a polarized epithelial cell line that was derived from human cortical collecting duct and has retained characteristics of principal cells (1Prié D. Friedlander G. Coureau C. Vandewalle A. Cassigena R. Ronco P.M. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1310-1318Google Scholar), such as its hormonal responsiveness to vasopressin which stimulates cAMP synthesis.We first analyzed the constitutive expression of water channels in HCD cells. A Western blot of HCD cell homogenate demonstrated the expression of AQP2 at the protein level. The staining of this band is weak but disappears using the peptide adsorbed antiserum, indicating that the staining is due to the presence of specific AQP2 antibodies. In addition, we confirmed that a band of a identical size and intensity was detected by anti-hAQP2 antibody, suggesting that the low intensity of the recognized band was not due to a poor cross-reactivity of anti-rAQP2 antibody with HCD cells. In agreement with these findings, a functional study showed that vasopressin treatment results only in a slight increase in cell swelling in the wild-type HCD cells.Immunoblot studies indicated also the presence of an AQP4-like protein in HCD cells. The AQP3 protein, which is also expressed in the basolateral membrane of collecting duct principal cells, does not seem to be expressed in HCD cells, based on Western blot experiments, although the possibility that an anti-rat AQP3 antibody does not cross-react with the human AQP3 cannot be ruled out.The constitutive expression of AQP2 and AQP4 proteins in HCD cells appears, however, very low. To make this cell line suitable for cell biology study of vasopressin-sensitive water channels, HCD epithelial cells were, therefore, stably transfected with cDNA encoding rat AQP2. High levels of AQP2 mRNA and protein were expressed in HCD cells that were transfected with AQP2 cDNA in plasmids harboring cytomegalovirus promoter. The transfected cells were referred to as CD8. This clone displays several features that make it unique and particularly useful for studies on the function and trafficking of the water channel AQP2. (a) It expresses the glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of the AQP2, both recognized by specific antibodies raised against the COOH-terminal end of the protein, which indicates that full maturity of the protein is attained in transfected cells. (b) Light and video confocal microscopy indicated that AQP2 was translocated from an intracellular site to the apical pole of the cells after vasopressin stimulation, an effect similar to that described on collecting duct principal cells in vivo (2Sabolic I. Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 165-175Google Scholar) and in perfused tubules (3Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Google Scholar). (c) The redistribution of AQP2 in CD8 cells was accompanied by a dramatic increase in osmotic water permeability, as demonstrated by TIR experiments, consistent with a high level of functional AQP2 expression in transfected cells. The osmotic water permeability coefficient Pf in vasopressin-stimulated CD8 cells was more that six times greater than that calculated under basal conditions. This effect of vasopressin was abolished by HgCl2, which should not affect the functionality of AQP4, the mercurial-insensitive aquaporin, which appears to be also expressed in HCD cells. In contrast, in the corresponding native cell line HCD, vasopressin treatment resulted in a slight but, on average, not significant increase of osmotic water permeability coefficient.In conclusion, the stably transfected cell line developed here exhibited the major features described in the parental collecting duct principal cells: 1) sensitivity to vasopressin; 2) expression of AQP2 in intracellular vesicles, which are shuttled to the apical pole after hormonal stimulation; and 3) dramatic, vasopressin-dependent increase in osmotic water permeability coefficient. To our knowledge, it represents the first cell culture model expressing functional AQP2 that is targeted to the apical membrane of the epithelial cell upon vasopressin exposure. The stably transfected cells can provide important direct experimental evidence for the intracellular signals involved in the translocation of AQP2 to the apical plasma membrane in presence of vasopressin.

The physiological relevance of the expression of homologous proteins having the same apparent function to transport water is still unexplained. Because of the complexity of the overall organization of the water transport regulation in the renal tubules, the availability of a cell culture system in which a pathway for water channels is retained “in vitro” would provide a powerful cellular tool for physiological studies.Recently, the establishment of the first human cell line deriving from cortical collecting duct (HCD) has been described (1Prié D. Friedlander G. Coureau C. Vandewalle A. Cassigena R. Ronco P.M. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1310-1318Google Scholar). HCD is a polarized epithelial cell line immortalized by SV40 virus and expressing principal cell characteristics. Cells are sensitive to vasopressin which strongly stimulates intracellular cAMP production. In addition, HCD cells express both A1 and A2 receptors for adenosine which have been demonstrated to modulate water reabsorption in the rabbit cortical collecting duct (18Dillingham M.A. Anderson R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 88: 277-281Google Scholar). In an attempt to search for a valuable cell culture system to study the cell biology of water channels, we tested the expression of members of the aquaporin family in HCD cells. Our findings demonstrate that HCD is the first cell line in which the AQP2 and AQP4 are constitutively expressed, although in a very low amount. In order to make this cell line suitable for cell biology studies of vasopressin-regulated water channel, HCD cells were stably transfected to overexpress AQP2. Transfected cells probed with AQP2 antiserum, intensely expressed a 29-kDa protein on immunoblot in addition to a broad band between 35 and 45 kDa which corresponds to the glycosylated form of the AQP2 protein. In addition, our results show that AQP2 is redistributed from an intracellular site to the apical pole of the cells after vasopressin stimulation and this effect is accompanied by a dramatic increase of the osmotic water permeability coefficient. These data suggest that transfected cells represent an interesting cell culture model for studying water channel biology."

INTRODUCTIONPlasmid-mediated resistance to the metalloid salts arsenite and antimonite has been observed in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Rosen et al., 13Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Shi W.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 85-91Google Scholar). In the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, the conjugative R-factor R773 confers resistance by coding for an ATP-coupled arsenite pump that actively extrudes the metalloid oxyanions out of the cell, thereby reducing their intracellular concentration to subtoxic levels (Rosen et al., 13Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Shi W.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 85-91Google Scholar). The pump is composed of ArsA, a 63-kDa peripheral membrane protein that is the catalytic subunit of the pump, and ArsB, a 45-kDa integral membrane protein that serves both as the membrane anchor for ArsA and as the anion-conducting pathway. Under physiological conditions, ArsA is a part of a complex with the ArsB protein in the inner membrane of E. coli. When expressed at high levels, ArsA is found predominantly as a soluble protein in the cytosol (Rosen et al., 12Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Google Scholar). Soluble ArsA has been purified and shown to be an As(III)- or Sb(III)-stimulated ATPase. The 583-amino acid ArsA has distinct binding sites for its substrate, ATP, and effector, As(III) or Sb(III) (Hsu and Rosen, 5Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Google Scholar).Genetic evidence suggests that allosteric activation occurs via the formation of a three-coordinate complex of As(III) or Sb(III) with the cysteine thiolates of residues 113, 172, and 422 (Bhattacharjee et al., 1Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Google Scholar). Although these three residues are located distant from each other in the primary sequence, these results imply that they come close together in the tertiary structure to interact with either As(III) or Sb(III). From the crystal structure of known As-thiol and Sb-thiol compounds (Sowerby, 16Sowerby D.B. Patai S. The Chemistry of Organic Arsenic, Antimony, and Bismuth Compounds. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 25Google Scholar), we would predict that the cysteine thiolates should be 3-4 Å from each other. The homobifunctional cross-linker 4,6-bis(bromomethyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1,5-diazabicyclo [3.3.0]octa-3,6-diene-2,8-dione (dibromobimane (bBBr)) 1The abbreviations used are: bBBr4,6-bis(bromomethyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octa- 3,6-diene-2,8-dione; DTNB 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisbpbase pair. was used to map distance between pair of cysteines in ArsA. bBBr has two equivalent bromomethyl groups that can cross-link a thiol pair located within 3-6 Å of each other (Mornet et al., 9Mornet D. Ue K. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1658-1662Google Scholar). bBBr is nonfluorescent in solution but becomes fluorescent when both of its alkylating groups have reacted (Haugland, 4Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1994: 56Google Scholar). This property allows bBBr to be used as a molecular ruler to map distance between cysteine residues.In this report we demonstrate that ArsA proteins with any one cysteine residue group altered by mutagenesis still formed fluorescent adducts. Proteins lacking any two of the three cysteines at residue 113, 172, or 422 did not form fluorescent adducts. The results demonstrate that Cys113, Cys172, and Cys422 are located within a distance of 3-6 Å from each other. A model is proposed where As(III) or Sb(III) interacts with the three cysteine thiolates in a trigonal pyramidal geometry, forming a soft metal-thiol cage at the metalloactivation domain of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONFrom the results of mutagenesis of cysteine codons in arsA we demonstrated that Cys113, Cys172, and Cys422 are required for allosteric activation of the ArsA ATPase (Bhattacharjee et al., 1Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Google Scholar). We proposed that activation by arsenite or antimonite occurs through soft metal-thiol interaction of As(III) or Sb(III) with the thiolate of those three cysteine residues. Although the three cysteine residue are located far apart in the primary sequence, they must come close enough in the tertiary structure to interact with the soft metals. From x-ray crystal data of As(III) or Sb(III) complexed to dithiols, the lengths of an As-S bond and Sb-S bond are 2.23 and 2.45 Å, respectively, while S-As-S and S-Sb-S angles are 92.7 and 84.8°, respectively (Sowerby, 16Sowerby D.B. Patai S. The Chemistry of Organic Arsenic, Antimony, and Bismuth Compounds. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 25Google Scholar). Moreover, using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and arsenic x-ray absorption spectroscopy, we have recently shown that the ArsR repressor binds As(III) to the thiolates of the cysteine triad of Cys32, Cys34, and Cys37 with As-S bonds of 2.25 Å (Shi et al., 15Shi W. Dong J. Scott R.A. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9291-9297Google Scholar). With the knowledge of these examples we propose a model for interaction of ArsA with As(III) or Sb(III) in which the thiolates of Cys113, Cys172, and Cys422 are coordinated to the metalloid in a trigonal pyramidal geometry (Fig. 6). This model predicts that the thiols should be within 3.1-3.5 Å of each other. To test this hypothesis, dibromobimane was used as a molecular ruler. bBBr rapidly inactivated the ATPase activity of ArsA, and synergistic protection from bBBr inactivation was observed when both the nucleotide substrate and metalloid effector were present (Fig. 1). Since bBBr reacts preferentially with cysteines, the protection experiment suggested that it is reacting with the cysteines located in the metalloactivation domain. Inactivation required modification of only two of the three essential cysteines. One cysteine reacted rapidly, whereas the other reacted more slowly (Fig. 2). This might reflect modification of a cysteine by one bromomethyl group of bBBr, followed by reaction of the remaining bromomethyl group with an adjacent cysteine.Dibromobimane is nonfluorescent until it cross-links two adjacent nucleophiles located within 3-6 Å of each other. The thiols of the cysteine triad would therefore be expected to react with bBBr to form fluorescent adducts. ArsA reacted with bBBr became highly fluorescent, and nearly all of the fluorescence was found in the 63-kDa band on SDS-PAGE, indicating intramolecular cross-linking of cysteines. To determine which cysteines reacted with bBBr, mutations were introduced to create proteins in which two, three, or four cysteines were altered to serines, greatly decreasing resistance to arsenite and antimonite (Fig. 3). The gene products were not grossly altered in structure. The rate of production of tryptic peptides was the same in the wild type and altered ArsAs, showing that surface accessibility of arginine and/or lysine residues was not modified. Binding of ATP produces a conformational change that decreases the rate of trypsin digestion (Hsu and Rosen, 5Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Google Scholar). None of the serine substitutions affected ATP protection, suggesting that the mutations did not reduce substrate binding (Fig. 4). The synergistic protection afforded by ATP and Sb(III) reflects a conformational change produced by effector binding. This cooperative protection was lost in each of the proteins in which any of the three cysteines of the triad were replaced by serine residues (C113S/C172S, C113S/C422S, and C172S/C422S). Only the C26S/C113S, C26S/C172S, and C26S/C422S enzymes retained any catalytic activity. The Km value for ATP for each was within an order of magnitude of the wild type enzyme. In contrast, the concentration of semimetal oxyanion required for activation was increased by 1-2 orders of magnitude, suggesting that As(III) or Sb(III) cannot interact with ArsA when any two cysteine thiolates of the triad are missing.The fluorescence of the ArsAs was monitored after bBBr modification. Substitution of serine for Cys26 had little effect on the steady state level of fluorescence (data not shown). C26S/C113S, in which only Cys172 and Cys422 remain, and C26S/C172S, in which Cys113 and Cys422 remain, produced fluorescent products similar to C26S. Thus, only two cysteines of the triad are required for bBBr cross-linking. C172S/C422S showed a significant lowering in the steady state level of fluorescence and a 7-fold decrease in the rate of modification, demonstrating that Cys172 and Cys422 are located within 3-6 Å of each other in the tertiary structure of ArsA. C113S/C422S reacted similarly with bBBr; thus, Cys113 and Cys422 must likewise be spatially proximate. C26S/C422S, in which Cys113 and Cys172 remain, was fluorescent after modification with bBBr, indicating that Cys113 and Cys172 are close enough to each other to cross-link. These data clearly demonstrate that Cys113, Cys172, and Cys422 are located within a distance of 3-6 Å from each other in the tertiary structure of ArsA, supporting the hypothesis that their thiolates are liganded to As(III) or Sb(III), forming a novel soft metal-thiol structure (Fig. 6). Interestingly, C113S/C172S, which retains Cys26 and Cys422, produced a fluorescent product with bBBr with a rate of reaction only 3-fold less than wild type ArsA (Table III). This is compared with a 7-fold decrease in reactivity in proteins with Cys26 and either Cys113 or Cys172. This may indicate that Cys26, which is not involved in metalloactivation, may be within 6 Å of Cys422 but further from Cys113 and Cys172.What is the relationship of metalloid binding and allosteric activation? The catalytically competent form of purified ArsA is a dimer, and the concentration of dimer in solution increases in the presence of Sb(III) or As(III) (Hsu et al., 6Hsu C.M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Google Scholar). This suggests that the metalloid binds to the conformation of the protein that preferentially self-associates. Thus, by mass action, effector binding increases the concentration of the active species. Why is Sb(III) nearly 10-fold more effective than As(III) as an activator? Although the overall geometry of the Sb-thiol structure should be similar to that of the As-thiol, the bond angles and distances would be different (Fig. 6). The As-S distance is predicted to be 2.23 Å, with S-S distances of 3.2 Å, while the Sb-S distance would be 2.45 Å, with S-S distances of 3.5 Å. The activator binding site may be slightly too large to accommodate As(III) without strain. The possibility that the metal binding specificity of this site could be altered mutagenically raises interesting possibilities for protein engineering.

In this report we demonstrate that ArsA proteins with any one cysteine residue group altered by mutagenesis still formed fluorescent adducts. Proteins lacking any two of the three cysteines at residue 113, 172, or 422 did not form fluorescent adducts. The results demonstrate that Cys113, Cys172, and Cys422 are located within a distance of 3-6 Å from each other. A model is proposed where As(III) or Sb(III) interacts with the three cysteine thiolates in a trigonal pyramidal geometry, forming a soft metal-thiol cage at the metalloactivation domain of the enzyme. DISCUSSIONFrom the results of mutagenesis of cysteine codons in arsA we demonstrated that Cys113, Cys172, and Cys422 are required for allosteric activation of the ArsA ATPase (Bhattacharjee et al., 1Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Google Scholar). We proposed that activation by arsenite or antimonite occurs through soft metal-thiol interaction of As(III) or Sb(III) with the thiolate of those three cysteine residues. Although the three cysteine residue are located far apart in the primary sequence, they must come close enough in the tertiary structure to interact with the soft metals. From x-ray crystal data of As(III) or Sb(III) complexed to dithiols, the lengths of an As-S bond and Sb-S bond are 2.23 and 2.45 Å, respectively, while S-As-S and S-Sb-S angles are 92.7 and 84.8°, respectively (Sowerby, 16Sowerby D.B. Patai S. The Chemistry of Organic Arsenic, Antimony, and Bismuth Compounds. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 25Google Scholar). Moreover, using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and arsenic x-ray absorption spectroscopy, we have recently shown that the ArsR repressor binds As(III) to the thiolates of the cysteine triad of Cys32, Cys34, and Cys37 with As-S bonds of 2.25 Å (Shi et al., 15Shi W. Dong J. Scott R.A. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9291-9297Google Scholar). With the knowledge of these examples we propose a model for interaction of ArsA with As(III) or Sb(III) in which the thiolates of Cys113, Cys172, and Cys422 are coordinated to the metalloid in a trigonal pyramidal geometry (Fig. 6). This model predicts that the thiols should be within 3.1-3.5 Å of each other. To test this hypothesis, dibromobimane was used as a molecular ruler. bBBr rapidly inactivated the ATPase activity of ArsA, and synergistic protection from bBBr inactivation was observed when both the nucleotide substrate and metalloid effector were present (Fig. 1). Since bBBr reacts preferentially with cysteines, the protection experiment suggested that it is reacting with the cysteines located in the metalloactivation domain. Inactivation required modification of only two of the three essential cysteines. One cysteine reacted rapidly, whereas the other reacted more slowly (Fig. 2). This might reflect modification of a cysteine by one bromomethyl group of bBBr, followed by reaction of the remaining bromomethyl group with an adjacent cysteine.Dibromobimane is nonfluorescent until it cross-links two adjacent nucleophiles located within 3-6 Å of each other. The thiols of the cysteine triad would therefore be expected to react with bBBr to form fluorescent adducts. ArsA reacted with bBBr became highly fluorescent, and nearly all of the fluorescence was found in the 63-kDa band on SDS-PAGE, indicating intramolecular cross-linking of cysteines. To determine which cysteines reacted with bBBr, mutations were introduced to create proteins in which two, three, or four cysteines were altered to serines, greatly decreasing resistance to arsenite and antimonite (Fig. 3). The gene products were not grossly altered in structure. The rate of production of tryptic peptides was the same in the wild type and altered ArsAs, showing that surface accessibility of arginine and/or lysine residues was not modified. Binding of ATP produces a conformational change that decreases the rate of trypsin digestion (Hsu and Rosen, 5Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Google Scholar). None of the serine substitutions affected ATP protection, suggesting that the mutations did not reduce substrate binding (Fig. 4). The synergistic protection afforded by ATP and Sb(III) reflects a conformational change produced by effector binding. This cooperative protection was lost in each of the proteins in which any of the three cysteines of the triad were replaced by serine residues (C113S/C172S, C113S/C422S, and C172S/C422S). Only the C26S/C113S, C26S/C172S, and C26S/C422S enzymes retained any catalytic activity. The Km value for ATP for each was within an order of magnitude of the wild type enzyme. In contrast, the concentration of semimetal oxyanion required for activation was increased by 1-2 orders of magnitude, suggesting that As(III) or Sb(III) cannot interact with ArsA when any two cysteine thiolates of the triad are missing.The fluorescence of the ArsAs was monitored after bBBr modification. Substitution of serine for Cys26 had little effect on the steady state level of fluorescence (data not shown). C26S/C113S, in which only Cys172 and Cys422 remain, and C26S/C172S, in which Cys113 and Cys422 remain, produced fluorescent products similar to C26S. Thus, only two cysteines of the triad are required for bBBr cross-linking. C172S/C422S showed a significant lowering in the steady state level of fluorescence and a 7-fold decrease in the rate of modification, demonstrating that Cys172 and Cys422 are located within 3-6 Å of each other in the tertiary structure of ArsA. C113S/C422S reacted similarly with bBBr; thus, Cys113 and Cys422 must likewise be spatially proximate. C26S/C422S, in which Cys113 and Cys172 remain, was fluorescent after modification with bBBr, indicating that Cys113 and Cys172 are close enough to each other to cross-link. These data clearly demonstrate that Cys113, Cys172, and Cys422 are located within a distance of 3-6 Å from each other in the tertiary structure of ArsA, supporting the hypothesis that their thiolates are liganded to As(III) or Sb(III), forming a novel soft metal-thiol structure (Fig. 6). Interestingly, C113S/C172S, which retains Cys26 and Cys422, produced a fluorescent product with bBBr with a rate of reaction only 3-fold less than wild type ArsA (Table III). This is compared with a 7-fold decrease in reactivity in proteins with Cys26 and either Cys113 or Cys172. This may indicate that Cys26, which is not involved in metalloactivation, may be within 6 Å of Cys422 but further from Cys113 and Cys172.What is the relationship of metalloid binding and allosteric activation? The catalytically competent form of purified ArsA is a dimer, and the concentration of dimer in solution increases in the presence of Sb(III) or As(III) (Hsu et al., 6Hsu C.M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Google Scholar). This suggests that the metalloid binds to the conformation of the protein that preferentially self-associates. Thus, by mass action, effector binding increases the concentration of the active species. Why is Sb(III) nearly 10-fold more effective than As(III) as an activator? Although the overall geometry of the Sb-thiol structure should be similar to that of the As-thiol, the bond angles and distances would be different (Fig. 6). The As-S distance is predicted to be 2.23 Å, with S-S distances of 3.2 Å, while the Sb-S distance would be 2.45 Å, with S-S distances of 3.5 Å. The activator binding site may be slightly too large to accommodate As(III) without strain. The possibility that the metal binding specificity of this site could be altered mutagenically raises interesting possibilities for protein engineering. From the results of mutagenesis of cysteine codons in arsA we demonstrated that Cys113, Cys172, and Cys422 are required for allosteric activation of the ArsA ATPase (Bhattacharjee et al., 1Bhattacharjee H.

An H42A mutation was shown earlier to decrease the rate of Compound I formation by a factor of ~106 and of guaiacol oxidation by a factor of ~104. In contrast, an F41A mutation has little effect on peroxidative catalysis (Newmyer, S. L., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 19430-19438). We report here construction, expression, and characterization of the F41H/H42A double mutant. The pH profile for guaiacol oxidation by this double mutant has a broad maximum at ~pH 6.3. Addition of H2O2 produces a Compound I species (λmax = 406 nm) that is reduced by 1 eq of K4Fe(CN)6 to the ferric state (λmax = 407 nm) without the detectable formation of Compound II. A fraction of the heme chromophore is lost in the process. The rate of Compound I formation for the F41H/H42A double mutant is 3.0 × 104M−1 s−1. This is to be compared with 0.9 × 107M−1 s−1 for wild-type HRP and 19 M−1 s−1 for the H42A mutant. The kcat values for guaiacol oxidation by wild-type, H42A, and F41H/H42A HRP are 300, 0.015, and 1.8 s−1. The corresponding kcat values for ABTS oxidation are 4900, 0.41, and 100 s−1, respectively. These results show that a histidine at position 41 substitutes, albeit imperfectly, for His-42 in peroxidative turnover of the enzyme. The F41H/H42A double mutant has peroxidative properties intermediate between those of the native enzyme and the H42A mutant. The F41H/H42A double mutant, however, is a considerably better thioanisole sulfoxidation and styrene epoxidation catalyst than native or H42A HRP. The surrogate catalytic residue introduced by the F41H mutation thus partially compensates for the H42A substitution used to increase access to the ferryl oxygen.

DMB was a product of Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan) and purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Neu5Ac was purchased from Nakalai (Kyoto, Japan). KDN and Neu5Gc were isolated and purified from KDN glycoprotein (4Kanamori A. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 744-749Google Scholar) and polysialoglycoprotein (21Inoue S. Matsumura G. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 74: 361-368Google Scholar), respectively. All columns for ion-exchange and gel chromatography were prepared from new batches of DEAE-Sephadex A-25 and Sephadex G-10 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), Bio-Gel P-2, Bio-Rad AG-1, and Dowex 1 (Dow Chemicals) in order to avoid possible contamination. Adult (200-300 g, body weight) and 7-day-old Wistar rats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of nembutal and the following organs dissected: forebrain, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, kidney, heart, lung, epididymal adipose tissue, thymus, spleen, submaxillary gland, and skeletal muscle. Lungs from adult and 7-day-old rats were also rinsed free of blood by perfusion with oxygenized Hanks balanced salt solution (pH 7.4, 37°C) through the right heart ventricle. All tissues were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and kindly mailed frozen on dry ice from Prof. Jürgen Roth, Division of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Zürich, Switzerland to Tokyo where they were kept frozen until use. Human lung squamous cell carcinoma lines Calu and Hotz as well as lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A 125 and A 549 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Stahel, Clinical Oncology, University Hospital Zürich to Prof. Roth) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and generously supplied to us by Prof. Roth. Pig submaxillary glands were purchased from a local slaughterhouse. Tissues (0.5-3 g, wet weight) or pellets (about 0.2 ml) of cultured cells were homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Litau, Switzerland) with 3-4 volumes of 0.01 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). A portion of the homogenate corresponding to 0.15-0.3 g of wet cells or tissue was mixed with methanol and chloroform keeping a chloroform/methanol/buffer solution ratio of 4:8:3 (v/v) (22Svennerholm L. Fredman P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 97-109Google Scholar), stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min. The precipitate was re-extracted with chloroform/methanol/0.01 M Tris-HCl (4:8:3) and centrifuged. The precipitate (designated as glycoprotein fraction) was suspended in 0.5-1 ml of 0.1 M trifluoroacetic acid and heated at 80°C for 1 h. The combined supernatants (designated as glycolipid fraction) were dried under reduced pressure and similarly hydrolyzed with trifluoroacetic acid. Both hydrolysates were separately diluted 10-fold with water, clarified by centrifugation, and applied to a Bio-Rad AG × 8 column (2-4 ml, formate form). The column was washed with 5 volumes of water and eluted successively with 3 volume each of 0.1 and 0.7 M formic acid. Eluates were dried under reduced pressure and derivatized for HPLC analysis. The majority of sialic acids was eluted with 0.7 M formic acid. Pig submaxillary gland (weighed 120 g, after removal of fat and connective tissue) was homogenized with 200 ml of 0.01 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in a Waring blender. The homogenate was made acidic by the addition of 2 M HCl (final concentration, 0.1 M HCl) and heated at 80°C for 90 min. The hydrolysate was cooled, neutralized with 2 M NaOH, diluted with 2 volumes of water, and clarified by centrifugation followed by filtration through glass wool. The filtrate were applied to a Dowex 1 × 8 column (4 × 30 cm, formate form). After washing the column with 2 volumes of water it was eluted successively with 0.1, 0.3, and 0.7 M formic acid (23Shauer R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 50: 64-89Google Scholar). The eluate with 0.7 M formic acid was TBA-positive, and it was dried under reduced pressure below 37°C. The pooled fractions from anion-exchange resins contained KDN, Neu5Ac, and Neu5Gc as revealed by HPLC analysis. These sialic acids were partially separated from each other by gel chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (2.4 × 82 cm) equilibrated and eluted with 0.05 M pyridine-acetic acid (pH 5.0) (6Iwasaki M. Inoue S. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2596-2602Google Scholar): the order of elution was Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and KDN. The concentration of sialic acids in the eluate fractions was monitored by the TBA reaction and HPLC analysis. When material from Bio-Gel P-2 still contained Neu5Gc, the latter was removed after methanolysis as methyl ketoside of neuraminate by adsorption on Dowex 50 cation exchange resin (1Nadano D. Iwasaki M. Endo S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11550-11557Google Scholar). DMB solution was prepared as described previously (20Hara S. Takemori Y. Yamaguchi M. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 138-145Google Scholar) except that we used 0.03-0.04 M trifluoroacetic acid as an acid. A 20-50-μl aliquot of the sample solution was mixed with an equal volume of DMB solution in a Teflon-lined screw-capped tapered glass tube and incubated for 2-2.5 h at 55°C in the dark. The final concentration of trifluoroacetic acid in the reaction mixture was 0.015-0.02 M. A Jasco LC-900 HPLC system equipped with a Jasco FP-920 fluorescence detector (set at wavelengths of 373 nm excitation and 448 nm emission) was operated isocratically at 1.0 ml/min and at the column temperature of 28-30°C. The column was a TSK-gel ODS-120T (250 × 4.6 mm, inner diameter). Methanol-acetonitrile-water (9:7:84, v/v) was used as an eluant. Purified samples of KDN were subjected to methanolysis in 0.5 M methanolic HCl at 65°C for 16 h and trimethylsilylation (24Nomoto H. Iwasaki M. Endo T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Matsumura G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 218: 335-341Google Scholar). A Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column CBJ 5 (30 m × 0.32 mm) was operated with a temperature gradient at 6°C/min from 180 to 260°C. Galactitol (1.25 μg) was added to the sample solution as an internal standard. One-dimensional 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra were recorded with a JNM-LA500 spectrometer (Jeol). Fast atom bombardment mass spectra of a methyl glycoside of KDN were measured using a JMS-SX102A mass spectrometer (Jeol) equipped with an MS-MP 7000 data system operated at 10 kV in negative ion mode. The presence of sialic acids in the crude sample solutions or in the column eluates was monitored by the TBA method (25Aminoff D. Biochem. J. 1961; 81: 384-392Google Scholar, 26Uchida Y. Tsukada Y. Sugimori T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 82: 1425-1433Google Scholar). We applied, with a minor modification, the fluorometric high-performance liquid chromatography originally reported by Hara et al. (20Hara S. Takemori Y. Yamaguchi M. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 138-145Google Scholar, 28Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Furuhata K. Ogura H. Nakamura M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 162-166Google Scholar) for detection of KDN, and quantitation of three different sialic acid residues in the samples originated from mammalian cells and tissues. Fig. 1a (see also Reaction R1) shows the elution profiles of the DMB derivatives of KDN, Neu5Ac, and Neu5Gc. One picomole of KDN in the hydrolysate of crude material was easily detectable, while the detection limit for authentic sialic acids was 100 fmol or less. The peak area was proportional to the amount of each sialic acid over wide range (practically up to 4 nmol), and the results were highly reproducible when the conditions of derivatization were kept constant. Precise identification of each peak was made by the retention time relative to that of Neu5Ac set equal to 1.00 (KDN, 0.74; Neu5Gc, 0.80). The retention time of 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octonic acid (KDO) was 0.79. Typical chromatograms for rat adipose tissue and human lung carcinoma cells are reproduced in Fig. 1,b and c, respectively.Fig. R1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The amounts of KDN, Neu5Gc, and Neu5Ac in glycolipid (extractable with chloroform/methanol/aqueous) and glycoprotein (non-extractable with the above solvent) fractions of various adult and P7 (7 days postnatal) rat tissues determined by the present HPLC method are shown in Fig. 2. The results for human lung cancer cells are given in Table I.

We isolated KDN from the mild acid hydrolysate of pig submaxillary gland. Three different kinds of sialic acid present in the pooled fraction obtained by anion-exchange chromatography were eluted separately on Bio-Gel P-2 column as shown in Fig. 3a. The elution profile was monitored by the HPLC analysis. Two KDN-containing peaks were detected and the second peak coincided with that of authentic KDN. The material under this peak was pooled, concentrated, and subjected to rechromatography on a smaller column of Bio-Gel P-2 (Fig. 3b). After the second Bio-Gel chromatography, the KDN fraction was free of other sialic acids as examined by HPLC analysis (Fig. 1d). The first KDN peak from the Bio-Gel P-2 column was found to comprise KDN-glycolipid that survived after mild acid hydrolysis. 2The amount of KDN found in this persisting KDN glycolipid fraction was actually small in total, i.e. less than one-fifth of that recovered as free KDN. In the present HPLC analysis, the glycosidically bound sialic acid (KDN) was partly released during derivatization reaction and detected on chromatogram. The total yield of KDN was about 300 μg as determined by the HPLC method. Fig. 4 depicts the gas liquid chromatograms of KDN isolated from pig submaxillary gland (a) and that of authentic KDN (b). The retention times of both KDN samples were completely identical. Values of chemical shifts and coupling constants of KDN isolated from pig submaxillary gland are given in Table II together with those for authentic KDN. We also determined the 1H NMR spectrum of methyl ester methyl-β-ketoside of KDN (KDN1,2Me2) isolated after methanolysis of KDN-rich fraction to remove contaminating Neu5Gc (see “Experimental Procedures”) and found the isolated compound exhibited the spectrum identical to that of the authentic KDN1,2Me2 (data not shown). Methyl-β-ketoside of KDN prepared by methanolysis of KDN followed by mild alkali treatment was subjected to FAB-mass analysis in the negative mode. A signal at m/z 281 confirmed the molecular ion of KDN2Me.Table II.Values of chemical shift and coupling constant for authentic KDN and KDN isolated from pig submaxillary glandChemical shiftaChemical shifts are given in ppm downfield from the methyl proton signal of sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,2,3-d4 for solutions in D2O at 28°C, and at pH ~7.

Open table in a new tab The question as to whether or not KDN is present in mammals remained unanswered until now, although the occurrence of α2→ 8-linked oligo/polyKDN glycotopes in mammalian tissues was indicated by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting method (14Kanamori A. Inoue S. Zuo X. Zuber C. Roth J. Kitajima K. Ye J. Troy F.A. Inoue Y. Histochemistry. 1994; 101: 333-340Google Scholar, 18Ziak M. Qu B. Zuo X. Zuber C. Kanamori A. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y.

In the previous immunostaining experiments we used mAb.kdn8kdn that recognizes α2→ 8-linked (KDN)n (n > 2), but not α2→ 8-linked (Neu5Ac)n nor α2→ 8-linked (Neu5Gc)n (14Kanamori A. Inoue S. Zuo X. Zuber C. Roth J. Kitajima K. Ye J. Troy F.A. Inoue Y. Histochemistry. 1994; 101: 333-340Google Scholar, 15Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Seki T. Troy F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18923-18928Google Scholar) and a new bacterial sialidase (KDNase Sm) that is highly specific to KDN ketosidic linkages (16Kitajima K. Kuroyanagi H. Inoue S. Ye J. Troy F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21415-21419Google Scholar, 17Nishino S. Kuroyanagi H. Terada T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Troy F.A. Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2909-2913Google Scholar) to show that the immunostaining was abolished by pretreatment of the sample with this enzyme (18Ziak M. Qu B. Zuo X. Zuber C. Kanamori A. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Roth J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2759-2763Google Scholar). Although our data based upon these specific reagents strongly suggested the occurrence of KDN residues in mammals, it was important to obtain the chemical evidence before drawing the final conclusion because KDN is a new building block of glycan chains. Demonstration of the occurrence in a variety of rat organs and some human lung cancer cells of very minute amounts of KDN other than Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc has been made possible by the introduction of the fluorescein-assisted HPLC method for identification and quantitation. Because KDN is thus far an unusual component, not previously encountered as a component of any glycoconjugates from mammals and because, in the above HPLC method, the identification is merely based on the elution position, KDN was isolated for its chemical characterization. Mild acid hydrolysis used in this study liberated almost all the KDN residues together with Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc. It should also be noted that methanolysis of a mixture of KDN and Neu5Acyl, which results in de-N-acylation of Neu5Acyl with the production of the methyl glycoside of free neuraminate, is particularly useful for separating KDN from Neu5Acyl by subsequent cation-exchange chromatography. In conclusion, KDN residues have now been unequivocally identified as a minor but definite component of mammalian glycoproteins and glycolipids. The present identification of KDN residues in mammalian systems raises several interesting future studies, including (a) structural elucidation of KDN-containing glycan chains, (b) their biosynthesis, and (c) biological function. It may be noted that we were successful in identification of CMP-KDN synthetase and KDN transferases in rainbow trout (29Terada T. Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Ito F. Troy F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2640-2648Google Scholar, 30Angata T. Kitazume S. Terada T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Troy F.A. Inoue Y. Glycoconjugate J. 1994; 11: 493-499Google Scholar), suggesting that this sugar nucleotide and the KDN-specific transferase(s) are also present in mammals. We are grateful to Dr. M. Tomioka and K. Shiobara of Showa University for 1H NMR and FAB-MS spectral measurements, respectively."

INTRODUCTIONThe largest subunit of RNAP 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseCTDC-terminal domainTFtranscription factorDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. II contains a highly conserved C-terminal domain composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with the consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7 (1Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 48: 143-179Google Scholar). The number of repeats varies in different organisms, with 26 in yeast and 52 in mammals. The exact function of the CTD in transcription is not clear. Genetic studies have shown the CTD to be essential in vivo; however, yeast can tolerate deletions leaving a minimum of eight repeats (2West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Google Scholar). In vitro, the CTD is not required in a reconstituted transcription system with the adenovirus major late promoter (3Kim W.-Y. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3169-3176Google Scholar), but is required at promoters lacking a consensus TATA sequence (4Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25033-25040Google Scholar, 5Buermeyer A.B. Strasheim L.A. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6798-6807Google Scholar). The CTD interacts with a variety of transcription factors in vitro, including TATA-binding protein, TFIIF, TFIIE, and the SRB complex (6Usheva A. Maldonado E. Goldring A. Lu H. Houbavi C. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 871-881Google Scholar, 7Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23390-23397Google Scholar, 8Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Google Scholar). The association of the SRB complex and other factors with RNAP II forms what has been termed the holoenzyme. This complex is thought to be recruited to promoters in vivo and to mediate activated transcription (9Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Google Scholar).The CTD is subject to extensive phosphorylation in vivo, with a stoichiometry of approximately one phosphate per repeat (1Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 48: 143-179Google Scholar). Phosphorylation predominantly occurs on serine residues, with small amounts on threonine and tyrosine residues. The unphosphorylated form of RNAP II is designated RNAP IIA, whereas the phosphorylated form is designated RNAP IIO. A variety of studies have shown that RNAP IIA and RNAP IIO have distinct functions during transcription and that each round of transcription is associated with the reversible phosphorylation of the CTD. RNAP IIA preferentially assembles into a preinitiation complex with transcription factors on promoter DNA (10Chesnut J.D. Stephens J.H. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10500-10506Google Scholar), whereas elongation of the transcript is almost exclusively catalyzed by RNAP IIO (11Cadena D.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12468-12474Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RNAP IIA occurs sometime during the initiation of transcription and is thought to trigger the release of RNAP II from the preinitiation complex (12Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13165-13173Google Scholar). RNAP IIO is presumably dephosphorylated at or after termination of transcription to regenerate RNAP IIA for the next round of transcription. CTD phosphorylation appears to be an important mechanism in regulating RNAP II activity in vivo, and changes in the phosphorylation state of RNAP II are associated with major changes in the pattern of transcription. For example, serum stimulation of quiescent cells, heat shock, and viral infection all dramatically alter cellular transcription and also result in a change in the phosphorylation state of RNAP II (13Dubois M.F. Bellier S. Seo S.J. Bensaude O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 417-426Google Scholar, 14Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Dahmus M.E. Pages G. Pouyssegar J. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4787-4797Google Scholar, 15Rice S.A. Long M.C. Lam V. Spencer C.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 988-1001Google Scholar).Many different protein kinases have been characterized that can phosphorylate the CTD in vitro. Two yeast protein kinases, CTK1 and KIN28, have been shown to be important for phosphorylation of RNAP II in vivo. Disruption of the CTK1 gene results in a large decrease in RNAP II phosphorylation in vivo (16Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167Google Scholar). The null mutant ctk1 cells, although viable, exhibit slow growth and other phenotypes, but it is not known what role CTK1 has in transcription. The KIN28 kinase is found associated with the general transcription factor IIH, which assembles into the preinitiation complex (17Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Google Scholar). The KIN28 gene is essential, and loss of the KIN28 kinase activity results in a dramatic decrease in RNAP II phosphorylation and transcriptional activity (18Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 535-544Google Scholar).Much less is known about CTD phosphatases. A CTD phosphatase activity has been purified from HeLa cells that is highly specific for RNAP II and dephosphorylates the CTD processively (19Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Google Scholar). Two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 205 and 150 kDa copurify with the HeLa CTD phosphatase activity, although it is not clear which contains the catalytic activity. In contrast to CTD kinases, HeLa CTD phosphatase does not use recombinant CTD as a substrate (20Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Google Scholar). Furthermore, CTD phosphatase is competitively inhibited by RNAP IIB, a form of RNAP II that lacks the CTD. These and other results suggested that a docking site exists on RNAP II that CTD phosphatase must first bind before it can gain access to the CTD. HeLa CTD phosphatase is also stimulated 5-fold by TFIIF, and the stimulation can be inhibited by TFIIB. The minimal region of TFIIF sufficient to stimulate CTD phosphatase is the C-terminal 160 amino acids of the RAP74 subunit (20Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Google Scholar).Serine/threonine protein phosphatases have been classified into four families, PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C, based on biochemical properties and amino acid sequence (21Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Google Scholar). PP1, PP2A, and PP2B are all inhibited by okadaic acid, although with differing sensitivities. PP2B requires calcium ions for activity, and PP2C requires magnesium ions. HeLa CTD phosphatase has been classified as a type 2C phosphatase based on its requirement for magnesium ions and its resistance to okadaic acid. This report describes the purification and characterization of a type 2C phosphatase from yeast specific for the CTD of RNAP II.DISCUSSIONYeast contains a protein phosphatase activity that is highly specific for dephosphorylating the largest subunit of yeast RNAP II. Many of the properties of the yeast CTD phosphatase are similar to those of the HeLa enzyme (19Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Google Scholar). These similarities include specificity for RNAP II as a substrate, stimulation of activity by the general transcription factor IIF, inhibition by excess RNAP II, resistance to the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, requirement for magnesium ions for activity, and inhibition by high concentrations of salt (19Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Google Scholar). The magnesium requirement and resistance to okadaic acid would characterize the yeast CTD phosphatase, like the HeLa enzyme, as a type 2C phosphatase. However, the yeast CTD phosphatase activity is also supported by calcium ions, a property not seen before in the type 2C class of enzymes (21Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Google Scholar). The HeLa CTD phosphatase cannot use calcium ions to support activity, but can use zinc, which did not support activity with the yeast enzyme. Other magnesium-dependent phosphatases are unaffected by calcium, inhibited (34Wang Y. Santini F. Qin K. Huang C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25607-25612Google Scholar), or stimulated (35Lawson J.E. Niu X.D. Browning K.S. Trong H.L. Yan J. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8987-8993Google Scholar). Millimolar amounts of calcium are required for significant activity of the yeast CTD phosphatase, and calcium does not support a level of activity higher than with magnesium alone. Thus, the enzyme is unlikely to be regulated by calcium in vivo. However, this unusual property could be used to distinguish it from other phosphatases in whole cell extracts.There appears to be a strict species specificity between each phosphatase and its cognate polymerase. The yeast and HeLa CTD phosphatases failed to dephosphorylate RNAP II from the other species. This species specificity is surprising since the heptapeptide repeats of the CTDs of yeast RNAP II and mammalian RNAP II are essentially identical. Previous studies with the HeLa CTD phosphatase indicated that there is a docking site on RNAP II distinct from the CTD where CTD phosphatase must interact before dephosphorylating the CTD (20Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Google Scholar). The species specificity is likely due to divergent protein structures at the docking site between the yeast and mammalian RNAP II molecules. Work directed toward identifying the subunit(s) of RNAP II important for interacting with CTD phosphatase is underway. Yeast RNAP II lacking either subunits 4 and 7 (25Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Google Scholar) or subunit 9 (26Woychik N.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Google Scholar) is dephosphorylated with equal efficiency compared with wild-type RNAP II.2There is an additional level of species specificity in CTD phosphatase function and that concerns the stimulation by TFIIF. The yeast and HeLa CTD phosphatases are stimulated only by their cognate TFIIF molecules, i.e. human TFIIF cannot stimulate yeast CTD phosphatase activity with either yeast or mammalian RNAP II. The HeLa CTD phosphatase has been shown to bind to human TFIIF and RAP74 deletion constructs immobilized on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads, and the binding interaction requires the C-terminal 160 amino acids of RAP74. 3R. S. Chambers and M. E. Dahmus, unpublished observations. Thus, at least two protein-protein interactions are likely to be important for efficient phosphatase activity, phosphatase with RNAP II and phosphatase with TFIIF. Human TFIIF functions with Drosophila RNAP II in an in vitro transcription elongation system (36Kephart D.D. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13536-13543Google Scholar), and TFIIF from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and that from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are functionally interchangeable in a heterologous in vitro transcription system (37Li Y. Flanagan P.M. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1994; 263: 805-807Google Scholar). However, Saccharomyces TFIIF does not function with mammalian RNAP II and transcription factors in an in vitro transcription assay. 4J. W. Conaway, personal communication. The highly purified yeast CTD phosphatase activity is stimulated >300-fold by an SP-Sepharose fraction from the CTD phosphatase purification that contains TFIIF. Highly purified HeLa CTD phosphatase is stimulated only 5-fold by recombinant human TFIIF (20Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Google Scholar). Surprisingly, recombinant yeast TFIIF did not stimulate highly purified yeast CTD phosphatase, but did stimulate partially purified fractions of CTD phosphatase. These results suggest that an additional essential factor for CTD phosphatase activity is fractionated from the 100/103-kDa component at the SP-Sepharose column step in the purification. If mammalian CTD phosphatase requires a similar factor, then it must remain stably associated since the HeLa enzyme showed no dramatic decline in activity after many purification steps and was not dependent on other fractions for activity (19Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Google Scholar). This difference in purified complexes might be analogous to the differential stability seen with TATA-binding protein- TATA-binding protein-associated factor complexes, which are stable in mammalian extracts, but dissociate during purification in yeast (38Poon D. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15325-15328Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE analysis of the highly purified yeast CTD phosphatase shows two bands with apparent molecular masses of 100 and 103 kDa. Glycerol gradient sedimentation and gel filtration analysis indicate a monomeric structure with an elongated shape. It is not clear if the two proteins represent two different forms of CTD phosphatase or if one of them is an unrelated protein. Microsequences from three peptides derived from the 100/103-kDa proteins match a single yeast gene of previously unknown function, predicting a highly acidic protein with a molecular mass of 83 kDa. 5J. Archambault, R. S. Chambers, G. Pan, M. Kobor, B. Andrews, C. M. Kane, and J. Greenblatt, manuscript in preparation. The yeast genome sequence data base contains five genes with homology to type 2C phosphatases with predicted molecular masses ranging from 32 to 64 kDa. None of these has detectable similarity to the 83-kDa protein. Since serine/threonine protein phosphatases are a highly conserved family of enzymes, the lack of detectable homology of the gene encoding the 83-kDa protein to other phosphatases presents two possibilities. The 83-kDa protein may represent a new specific class of protein phosphatases. Alternatively, this protein may have a regulatory role in CTD phosphatase function. The isolation and characterization of CTD phosphatase from yeast now allow a combined biochemical and genetic analysis to distinguish these possibilities. In addition, the function of this enzyme during transcription can now be examined in detail. INTRODUCTIONThe largest subunit of RNAP 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseCTDC-terminal domainTFtranscription factorDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. II contains a highly conserved C-terminal domain composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with the consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7 (1Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 48: 143-179Google Scholar). The number of repeats varies in different organisms, with 26 in yeast and 52 in mammals. The exact function of the CTD in transcription is not clear. Genetic studies have shown the CTD to be essential in vivo; however, yeast can tolerate deletions leaving a minimum of eight repeats (2West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Google Scholar). In vitro, the CTD is not required in a reconstituted transcription system with the adenovirus major late promoter (3Kim W.-Y. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3169-3176Google Scholar), but is required at promoters lacking a consensus TATA sequence (4Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25033-25040Google Scholar, 5Buermeyer A.B. Strasheim L.A. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6798-6807Google Scholar). The CTD interacts with a variety of transcription factors in vitro, including TATA-binding protein, TFIIF, TFIIE, and the SRB complex (6Usheva A. Maldonado E. Goldring A. Lu H. Houbavi C. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 871-881Google Scholar, 7Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23390-23397Google Scholar, 8Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Google Scholar). The association of the SRB complex and other factors with RNAP II forms what has been termed the holoenzyme. This complex is thought to be recruited to promoters in vivo and to mediate activated transcription (9Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Google Scholar).The CTD is subject to extensive phosphorylation in vivo, with a stoichiometry of approximately one phosphate per repeat (1Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 48: 143-179Google Scholar). Phosphorylation predominantly occurs on serine residues, with small amounts on threonine and tyrosine residues. The unphosphorylated form of RNAP II is designated RNAP IIA, whereas the phosphorylated form is designated RNAP IIO. A variety of studies have shown that RNAP IIA and RNAP IIO have distinct functions during transcription and that each round of transcription is associated with the reversible phosphorylation of the CTD. RNAP IIA preferentially assembles into a preinitiation complex with transcription factors on promoter DNA (10Chesnut J.D. Stephens J.H. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10500-10506Google Scholar), whereas elongation of the transcript is almost exclusively catalyzed by RNAP IIO (11Cadena D.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12468-12474Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RNAP IIA occurs sometime during the initiation of transcription and is thought to trigger the release of RNAP II from the preinitiation complex (12Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13165-13173Google Scholar). RNAP IIO is presumably dephosphorylated at or after termination of transcription to regenerate RNAP IIA for the next round of transcription. CTD phosphorylation appears to be an important mechanism in regulating RNAP II activity in vivo, and changes in the phosphorylation state of RNAP II are associated with major changes in the pattern of transcription. For example, serum stimulation of quiescent cells, heat shock, and viral infection all dramatically alter cellular transcription and also result in a change in the phosphorylation state of RNAP II (13Dubois M.F. Bellier S. Seo S.J. Bensaude O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 417-426Google Scholar, 14Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Dahmus M.E. Pages G. Pouyssegar J. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4787-4797Google Scholar, 15Rice S.A. Long M.C. Lam V. Spencer C.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 988-1001Google Scholar).Many different protein kinases have been characterized that can phosphorylate the CTD in vitro. Two yeast protein kinases, CTK1 and KIN28, have been shown to be important for phosphorylation of RNAP II in vivo. Disruption of the CTK1 gene results in a large decrease in RNAP II phosphorylation in vivo (16Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167Google Scholar). The null mutant ctk1 cells, although viable, exhibit slow growth and other phenotypes, but it is not known what role CTK1 has in transcription. The KIN28 kinase is found associated with the general transcription factor IIH, which assembles into the preinitiation complex (17Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Google Scholar). The KIN28 gene is essential, and loss of the KIN28 kinase activity results in a dramatic decrease in RNAP II phosphorylation and transcriptional activity (18Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 535-544Google Scholar).Much less is known about CTD phosphatases. A CTD phosphatase activity has been purified from HeLa cells that is highly specific for RNAP II and dephosphorylates the CTD processively (19Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Google Scholar). Two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 205 and 150 kDa copurify with the HeLa CTD phosphatase activity, although it is not clear which contains the catalytic activity. In contrast to CTD kinases, HeLa CTD phosphatase does not use recombinant CTD as a substrate (20Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Google Scholar). Furthermore, CTD phosphatase is competitively inhibited by RNAP IIB, a form of RNAP II that lacks the CTD. These and other results suggested that a docking site exists on RNAP II that CTD phosphatase must first bind before it can gain access to the CTD. HeLa CTD phosphatase is also stimulated 5-fold by TFIIF, and the stimulation can be inhibited by TFIIB. The minimal region of TFIIF sufficient to stimulate CTD phosphatase is the C-terminal 160 amino acids of the RAP74 subunit (20Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Google Scholar).Serine/threonine protein phosphatases have been classified into four families, PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C, based on biochemical properties and amino acid sequence (21Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Google Scholar). PP1, PP2A, and PP2B are all inhibited by okadaic acid, although with differing sensitivities. PP2B requires calcium ions for activity, and PP2C requires magnesium ions. HeLa CTD phosphatase has been classified as a type 2C phosphatase based on its requirement for magnesium ions and its resistance to okadaic acid. This report describes the purification and characterization of a type 2C phosphatase from yeast specific for the CTD of RNAP II."
https://openalex.org/W1983202302,"The CaLB domain is a 43-amino acid sequence motif found in a number of functionally diverse signaling proteins including three Ras-specific GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). In the Ras GTPase activating protein, P120GAP, this domain has the ability to confer membrane association in response to intracellular Ca2+ elevation. Here we have isolated three proteins, p55, p70, and p120, which interact with the P120GAP CaLB domain in vitro. We identify p70 as the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein annexin VI. Using co-immunoprecipitation studies, we have shown that the interaction between P120GAP and annexin VI is also detectable in rat fibroblasts, suggesting that this interaction may have a physiological role in vivo. Thus, the CaLB domain in P120GAP appears to have the ability to direct specific protein-protein interactions with Ca2+-dependent membrane-associated proteins. In addition, annexin VI is known to have tumor suppressor activity. Therefore, it is possible that the interaction of annexin VI with P120GAP may be important in the subsequent modulation of p21ras activity.

INTRODUCTIONp21ras proteins play a critical role in cellular proliferation and differentiation pathways (1Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Google Scholar, 2Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Google Scholar). Mutations in p21ras which result in their constitutive activation are associated with certain forms of cancer (3Goldfarb M.P. Shimizu K. Perucho M. Wigler M. Nature. 1982; 296: 404-409Google Scholar, 4Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689Google Scholar). GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase activating proteinsCaLBCa2+-dependent lipid bindingGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHRPhorseradish peroxidase. are important in inactivating p21ras (5Hall A.

Science. 1987; 238: 454-542Google Scholar) and, in addition, may themselves be signal transducers (8McCormick F. Cell. 1989; 56: 5-8Google Scholar, 9Duchesne M. Schweighoffer F. Parker F. Clerc F. Frobert Y. Thang M.N. Tocque B. Science. 1993; 259: 525-528Google Scholar). Primary sequence analysis of Ras-specific GAPs indicates that P120GAP, GAP1m, and GAP1IP4BP display 25-30% sequence identity with each other in a region called the “CaLB” (Ca2+-dependent lipid binding) domain (10Vogel U.S. Dixon R.A.

Lin L-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Google Scholar). The function of the CaLB domain is unknown. However, since these GAPs are all able to specifically regulate p21ras activity, it is possible that the CaLB domain may play a common signaling role in these proteins which could be important in the Ras signaling pathway. Discrete modular domains found within proteins in the Ras signaling pathway have been shown to mediate important protein-protein interactions which are involved in signal transduction (14Mayer B.J. Ren R. Clark K.L. Baltimore D. Cell. 1993; 73: 629-630Google Scholar, 15Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Google Scholar, 16Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether protein-protein interactions could be mediated via the CaLB domain in P120GAP. We rationalized that if CaLB-binding proteins could be isolated and identified, then the role of the CaLB domain in Ras GAPs may become apparent. Here we demonstrate that the CaLB domain of P120GAP interacts directly with annexin VI which is a major Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding protein (17Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Google Scholar, 18Edwards H.C. Moss S.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 293-299Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the CaLB domain in P120GAP may be a convergence point in Ca2+ and Ras signaling pathways. In addition, these protein-protein interactions could have important implications in the tumor suppressor activity associated with annexin VI expression (19Theobald J. Hanby A. Moss S.E. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 786-788Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOur previous work has shown that the CaLB domain of P120GAP is important for the Ca2+-dependent association of this protein with cellular membranes (20Gawler D.J. Zhang L.-J. Reedijk M. Tung P.S. Moran M.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 817-825Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that one mechanism involved in this process may be the binding of this domain to negatively charged phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner (21Gawler D.J. Zhang L.-J.W. Moran M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 487-491Google Scholar). In addition, we have suggested that a high affinity Ca2+-dependent interaction of the domain with membranes may also occur (20Gawler D.J. Zhang L.-J. Reedijk M. Tung P.S. Moran M.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 817-825Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether the CaLB domain of P120GAP could be interacting with Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding components, we extracted rat fibroblast membranes with a buffer containing a high EGTA concentration. After extraction, we undertook membrane-binding studies to establish if the association of the CaLB domain with cellular membranes was altered. Using 35S-labeled GSTCaLB fusion protein to quantify the association of the CaLB domain with membranes (Fig. 1), we observed that EGTA extraction caused a significant reduction in binding of the fusion protein to membranes. One explanation for this could be that a membrane component, to which the fusion protein binds, had been removed upon chelation of calcium. Therefore, we investigated whether the CaLB domain could be interacting with protein(s) which associate with membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Such proteins were isolated by preparing membranes firstly in the presence of Ca2+ and then subsequently extracting them with a buffer containing a high concentration of EGTA. In this way, EGTA-extractable proteins were collected as an “S2” supernatant fraction after centrifugation. Proteins contained in this S2 fraction were then labeled with biotin and analyzed by Western blotting. We detected many proteins in this extractable fraction (data not shown) but, upon incubation of this S2 fraction with GST or GSTCaLB fusion proteins, specific proteins were found to complex with the GSTCaLB fusion protein but not with GST (Fig. 2A). In addition, subsequent Far Western analysis indicated that only one of these proteins bound directly to the CaLB domain (Fig. 2B). However, this finding may reflect either the loss of CaLB binding activity of some proteins upon SDS denaturation or may indicate that only one protein in the complex has the ability to directly bind to the CaLB domain.Fig. 2Detection of GSTCaLB complexing proteins.A, detection of complexing proteins in rat fibroblast cell extracts. 30 nM GST (lane 1) or GSTCaLB (lane 2) fusion proteins were incubated with S2 cell extracts collected from EGTA-washing fibroblast membranes which had previously been prepared in the presence of 1 μM Ca2+. Proteins complexing with fusion proteins were labeled with biotin and detected on Western blots with avidin-HRP and ECL. B, GSTCaLB fusion protein but not GST binds directly to a 70-kDa protein in rat fibroblast membranes. 200 μg of cellular membrane (P1) fractions prepared from fibroblasts in the presence of 1 μM free Ca2+ were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and incubated with 30 nM GST (lane 1) or GSTCaLB (lane 2). GST and GSTCaLB binding was detected using anti-GST antibodies, followed by anti-rabbit-HRP probing and ECL detection. C, Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding proteins purified from sheep liver. A 10-μl aliquot (20 μg of total protein) of Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding proteins purified from sheep liver were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by silver staining. D, detection of GSTCaLB complexing proteins and their purification from sheep liver. 30 nM GST (lanes 1 and 3) or GSTCaLB (lanes 2 and 4) fusion proteins were incubated in the presence (lanes 3 and 4) or absence (lanes 1 and 2) of Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding proteins purified from sheep liver. Proteins complexing with fusion proteins were labeled with biotin and detected on Western blots by probing with avidin-HRP and ECL detection. All data shown are representative of n > 2 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Previously, several groups have characterized Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding proteins from various tissues (17Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Google Scholar, 18Edwards H.C. Moss S.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 293-299Google Scholar). Liver has been shown to be a particularly rich source of these proteins (22Boustead C.M. Walker J.H. Geisow M.J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 233-238Google Scholar, 23Boustead C.M. Walker J.H. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium, a Practical Approach. IRL Press & Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1991: 247Google Scholar). We therefore prepared a purified fraction of Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding proteins from sheep liver (Fig. 2C). We subsequently incubated GST and GSTCaLB fusion proteins with these purified proteins and again used biotin to label complexing proteins. We detected three proteins which bound specifically to GSTCaLB but not GST fusion proteins. We have called these proteins p55, p70, and p120 with respect to their apparent molecular weights as assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2D). The Ca2+-dependent association of p70 with cell membranes suggested that it could be the protein annexin VI. This protein has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 68 kDa and displays Ca2+-dependent membrane binding properties (17Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Google Scholar, 18Edwards H.C. Moss S.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 293-299Google Scholar, 24Crompton M.R. Owens R.J. Totty N.F. Moss S.E. Waterfield M.D. Crumpton M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 21-27Google Scholar). To establish if p70 was annexin VI, we used anti-annexin VI antibodies to identify proteins which were complexing with GSTCaLB fusion protein. The 70-kDa protein was indeed recognized by our anti-annexin VI antibody (Fig. 3A). Since our in vitro studies were undertaken using only the isolated CaLB domain sequence, it was important to establish if full-length P120GAP protein could also be detected as interacting with annexin VI in cell extracts. We immunoprecipitated P120GAP from rat fibroblast cell lysates using anti-P120GAP antibodies and probed Western blots for the presence of annexin VI. Our results confirmed that annexin VI is indeed able to complex with P120GAP (Fig. 3A). We then labeled all proteins which co-precipitated with P120GAP with biotin in order to evaluate the specificity of these co-immunoprecipitation studies. Using Western blot analysis, we detected co-precipitating proteins with molecular masses of 190 kDa, 120 kDa, ~90-100 kDa, and ~60-70 kDa (Fig. 3B). It is well established that P120GAP binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins p190 and p62 (28Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1989; 342: 711-714Google Scholar). Additionally, the 120-kDa protein band detected may be P120GAP and also our 120-kDa CaLB domain interacting protein. Similarly, the protein band detected at ~60-70 kDa may also contain our p70 (annexin VI) protein. The identity of the protein with an estimated molecular mass of ~90-100 kDa is not known. It is possible that this protein is interacting with P120GAP at a site within the protein that is distinct from the CaLB domain because we have not detected a protein of this size in our in vitro CaLB binding studies (Fig. 2).Fig. 3Co-immunoprecipitation of annexin VI and P120GAP from rat fibroblasts.A, immunoprecipitation of P120GAP results in the co-precipitation of annexin VI from rat fibroblast cell lysates. Glutathione-agarose beads (lane 1), 30 nM GST-glutathione agarose (lane 2), or 30 nM GSTCaLB-glutathione agarose (lane 3) was incubated with rat fibroblast cell lysates. Similarly, annexin VI (lane 4) or P120GAP (lane 5) was immunoprecipitated from rat fibroblast cell lysates. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blots probed with anti-annexin VI antibodies and detected using anti-rabbit-HRP antibodies and ECL.B, biotin labeling of proteins co-precipitating with anti-P120GAP antibodies. Rat fibroblast cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GAP antibodies and labeled with biotin. Co-immunoprecipitating proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blots probed with anti-avidin-HRP and detected on film using ECL. C, immunoprecipitation of annexin VI results in the co-precipitation of P120GAP in rat fibroblast cell lysates. Rat fibroblast cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GAP (lane 1), anti-annexin VI (lane 2) antibodies, and preimmune sera (lane 3). Western blots were probed with anti-GAP antibodies and detected using HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies and ECL. All data shown are representative of n > 2 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm the co-precipitation of annexin VI and P120GAP, we immunoprecipitated annexin VI and complexing proteins from fibroblasts. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to detect P120GAP (Fig. 3C). We again found that P120GAP and annexin VI co-precipitated, and these data strongly suggest that an interaction occurs between these two proteins in vivo. Our anti-annexin VI antibody is clearly specific since preimmune rabbit sera does not co-precipitate P120GAP (Fig. 3C) or annexin VI (data not shown). Also, both our antibodies have been previously well characterized for their specificity for antigen recognition (26Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Google Scholar, 27Tagoe C.E. Boustead C.M. Higgins S.J. Walker J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1192: 272-280Google Scholar). Using GSTCaLB fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads to bind CaLB-complexed proteins, we have also demonstrated that the 70-kDa protein isolated from fibroblasts is detected by the anti-annexin VI antibody (Fig. 3A). Since p55 was not detected by the anti-annexin VI antibody, p55 is unlikely to be a proteolytic product of p70. Instead we believe that p55 is a distinct protein in the CaLB binding complex. We have also obtained similar results using GSTCaLB to isolate proteins from sheep liver extracts (data not shown). Therefore, these data strongly suggest that p70, which binds to the P120GAP CaLB domain in fibroblast and sheep liver extracts, is annexin VI.Since it was conceivable that our anti-annexin VI antibody could be recognizing a protein with a similar molecular weight and related amino acid sequence to annexin VI, we used recombinant annexin VI to verify its interaction with P120GAP. We expressed recombinant human annexin VI in the form of a GST fusion protein, immobilized the fusion protein on glutathione-agarose beads, and incubated it with rat fibroblast cell lysates. Interaction of P120GAP with annexin VI was investigated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). The results obtained confirmed that recombinant annexin VI can complex with P120GAP. Further verification that annexin VI can bind directly to the CaLB domain of P120GAP was obtained using Far Western analysis. Annexin VI was prepared from the GST-annexin VI fusion protein by proteolytic cleavage. Both intact annexin VI and proteolytic fragments of the protein were observed (Fig. 4B). The CaLB domain of a GSTCaLB fusion protein was able to bind to both the full-length annexin VI and proteolytic fragments of the protein (Fig. 4C). The GST protein alone did not bind to cleaved annexin VI or to its proteolytic fragments, and the anti-GST antibody only detected the cleaved GST fragment on the blot (Fig. 4C). These data are consistent with the CaLB domain recognizing a sequence motif within annexin VI because the protein-protein interaction is detected after SDS denaturation of annexin VI. It still remains to be established whether other proteins containing CaLB domains can also interact with annexins. Indeed, it is possible that the CaLB domain recognizes a specific “CaLB domain binding motif.” If such a recognition site exists, then its elucidation would be of use in the potential design and targeting of drugs which may disrupt signaling pathways. This is of particular interest if the P120GAP CaLB domain or the CaLB domains of GAP1m or GAP1IP4BP are found to be involved in effector functions of Ras proteins.Fig. 4Recombinant human annexin VI directly interacts with the CaLB domain of P120GAP.A, GST-annexin VI but not GST complexes with P120GAP in rat fibroblast cell lysates. 1 μM GST-annexin VI (lane 1) or 1 μM GST (lane 2) fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with lysates of rat fibroblasts. Similarly, P120GAP was immunoprecipitated from lysates of fibroblasts as a corresponding positive control (lane 3). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose by Western blotting. Blots were then probed with anti-P120GAP antibodies to detect P120GAP presence in protein complexes.b, cutting GST-annexin VI to remove the N-terminal GST sequence and yield annexin VI protein. 1 μg of GST-annexin VI fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose was treated with thrombin to yield annexin VI and GST proteins. Lane 1, uncut fusion protein; lane 2, cut fusion protein.C, human annexin VI binds directly to the CaLB domain of P120GAPin vitro. GST-annexin VI was cleaved with thrombin to remove the N-terminal GST sequence and yield recombinant annexin VI which was resolved using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose by Western blotting. Binding of either 30 nM GSTCaLB (lane 1) or GST (lane 2) to the cleaved fusion protein was then determined in the presence of 1 μM Ca2+. Anti-GST antibodies were used to detect fusion protein binding to annexin VI followed by anti-rabbit-HRP probing and ECL detection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In summary, we conclude that annexin VI can directly interact with P120GAP via the CaLB domain. Also, the fact that it can be co-immunoprecipitated with P120GAP from fibroblast lysates suggests there may be a physiological role in cells for this association. Intriguingly, annexin VI has been suggested to have a tumor suppressor function (19Theobald J. Hanby A. Moss S.E. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 786-788Google Scholar). Conceivably, this tumor suppressor activity could be related to its ability to interact with P120GAP and thereby regulate p21ras activity. It is possible that the interaction of annexin VI with P120GAP could be required for the relocation of these proteins to the plasma membrane. Annexin VI is known to translocate from a cytoplasmic location to the plasma membrane in response to calcium elevation (25Barwise J.L. Walker J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 247-255Google Scholar). Similarly, P120GAP relocates from a cytoplasmic location to the plasma membrane to access Ras proteins. This process can be triggered by Ca2+ elevation and is dependent upon the CaLB domain (20Gawler D.J. Zhang L.-J. Reedijk M. Tung P.S. Moran M.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 817-825Google Scholar). However, the precise role which Ca2+ plays in the annexin VI/P120GAP CaLB domain interaction still needs to be established. Also, the identity and function of the associating proteins p55 and p120 need to be elucidated. However, we have established that p120 is not P120GAP since it is not recognized by our anti-P120GAP antibodies.Finally, our work suggests that the CaLB domain is probably another example of a “modular binding domain” (14Mayer B.J. Ren R. Clark K.L. Baltimore D. Cell. 1993; 73: 629-630Google Scholar, 15Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Google Scholar, 16Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Google Scholar). Modular binding domains appear to be of central importance in mediating protein-protein interactions and signal transduction processes.Our data suggest that the CaLB domain could function as a regulation or integration point between convergent signaling pathways. In particular, it may be directing protein-protein interactions between components of Ca2+ and Ras signaling pathways. Future work should establish more fully the role of P120GAP and the function of this CaLB domain and annexins in cell signaling processes. INTRODUCTIONp21ras proteins play a critical role in cellular proliferation and differentiation pathways (1Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Google Scholar, 2Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Google Scholar). Mutations in p21ras which result in their constitutive activation are associated with certain forms of cancer (3Goldfarb M.P. Shimizu K. Perucho M. Wigler M. Nature. 1982; 296: 404-409Google Scholar, 4Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689Google Scholar). GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase activating proteinsCaLBCa2+-dependent lipid bindingGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHRPhorseradish peroxidase. are important in inactivating p21ras (5Hall A. Science. 1990; 249: 635-640Google Scholar, 6Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Google Scholar, 7Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 454-542Google Scholar) and, in addition, may themselves be signal transducers (8McCormick F. Cell. 1989; 56: 5-8Google Scholar, 9Duchesne M. Schweighoffer F. Parker F. Clerc F. Frobert Y. Thang M.N. Tocque B. Science. 1993; 259: 525-528Google Scholar). Primary sequence analysis of Ras-specific GAPs indicates that P120GAP, GAP1m, and GAP1IP4BP display 25-30% sequence identity with each other in a region called the “CaLB” (Ca2+-dependent lipid binding) domain (10Vogel U.S. Dixon R.A.

Lin L-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Google Scholar). The function of the CaLB domain is unknown. However, since these GAPs are all able to specifically regulate p21ras activity, it is possible that the CaLB domain may play a common signaling role in these proteins which could be important in the Ras signaling pathway. Discrete modular domains found within proteins in the Ras signaling pathway have been shown to mediate important protein-protein interactions which are involved in signal transduction (14Mayer B.J. Ren R. Clark K.L. Baltimore D. Cell. 1993; 73: 629-630Google Scholar, 15Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Google Scholar, 16Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether protein-protein interactions could be mediated via the CaLB domain in P120GAP. We rationalized that if CaLB-binding proteins could be isolated and identified, then the role of the CaLB domain in Ras GAPs may become apparent. Here we demonstrate that the CaLB domain of P120GAP interacts directly with annexin VI which is a major Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding protein (17Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Google Scholar, 18Edwards H.C. Moss S.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 293-299Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the CaLB domain in P120GAP may be a convergence point in Ca2+ and Ras signaling pathways. In addition, these protein-protein interactions could have important implications in the tumor suppressor activity associated with annexin VI expression (19Theobald J. Hanby A. Moss S.E. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 786-788Google Scholar)."

(1995) FEBS Lett. 360, 93-96) has been used to localize active site residues in the type I and type II dehydroquinases. Both enzymes have essential hyper-reactive arginine residues, and the type II enzymes have an essential tyrosine residue. The essential hyper-reactive Arg-23 of the Streptomyces coelicolor type II enzyme has been replaced by lysine, glutamine, and alanine residues. The mutant enzymes were purified and shown by CD spectroscopy to be structurally similar to the wild-type enzyme. All three mutant enzymes were much less active, for example the kcat of the R23A mutant was 30,000-fold reduced. The mutants all had reduced Km values, indicating stronger substrate binding, which was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. A role for Arg-23 in the stabilization of a carbanion intermediate is proposed. Comparison of the amino acid sequence around the hyper-reactive arginine residues of the two classes of enzymes indicates that there is a conserved structural motif that might reflect a common substrate binding fold at the active center of these two classes of enzyme.

It is generally believed that enzymes have evolved to catalyze reactions by optimal mechanisms. With the exception of the four classes of proteinases (1Page M.I. Williams A. Enzyme Mechanisms. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1987: 140,229-170,258Google Scholar) and the two classes of aldolases (2Rutter W.J. Fed. Proc. 1964; 23: 1248-1257Google Scholar), examples of mechanistically different pairs of enzymes that catalyze the same reaction are very rare. This unusual situation is found with the two classes of dehydroquinase that catalyze the dehydration of 3-dehydroquinate to form 3-dehydroshikimate (3Harris J. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. Hawkins A.R. Abell C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; : 1080-1081Google Scholar). The reaction is common to two metabolic pathways: the biosynthetic shikimate pathway that is used for the synthesis of aromatic compounds in plants and micro-organisms (4Haslam E. The Shikimate Pathway. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1974Google Scholar) and the catabolic quinate pathway that enables fungi and some other micro-organism to use quinate as a carbon and energy source (5Giles N.H. Case M.E. Baum J. Geever R. Huiet L. Patel V. Tyler B. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 338-358Google Scholar). The type I dehydroquinases (DHQase) 1The abbreviations used are: DHQasedehydroquinaseES-MSelectrospray mass spectrometryHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyITCisothermal titration calorimetryPGOphenylglyoxalTNMtetranitromethane. catalyze a cis elimination and are only involved in the biosynthesis of shikimate (6Chaudhuri S. Lambert J.M. McColl L.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 699-704Google Scholar), whereas the type II enzymes, which catalyze a trans elimination (1Page M.I. Williams A. Enzyme Mechanisms. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1987: 140,229-170,258Google Scholar), have been found to have either a biosynthetic (7White P.J. Young J. Hunter I. Nimmo H.G. Coggins J.R. Biochem.

Genet. 1982; 20: 271-286Google Scholar) and in at least one species a dual role (9Euverink G.J.W. Hessels G.I. Vrijbloed J.W. Coggins J.R. Dijkhuizen L. J. Gen.

Besides being mechanistically distinct, the two classes of DHQase have very different biophysical properties and are apparently unrelated at the level of primary structure (10Garbe T. Servos S.

Hawkins A.R. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 687-695Google Scholar). The type I enzymes are dimers with a molecular mass of about 46,000 Da; they are heat-labile and use a mechanism that involves the formation of a Schiff-base intermediate followed by the abstraction of a proton by a general base (12Chaudhuri S. Duncan K. Graham L.D. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 1-6Google Scholar, 13Shneier A. Kleanthous C. Deka R. Coggins J.R. Abell C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9416-9418Google Scholar, 14Deka R.K.

In the case of the type I Escherichia coli enzyme the lysine residue has been located (Lys-170) by trapping the Schiff-base intermediate by borohydride reduction (12Chaudhuri S. Duncan K. Graham L.D. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 1-6Google Scholar, 13Shneier A. Kleanthous C. Deka R. Coggins J.R. Abell C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9416-9418Google Scholar), and this residue is conserved in all type I sequences (12Chaudhuri S. Duncan K. Graham L.D. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 1-6Google Scholar) as is His-143 (15Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Google Scholar, 16Deka R.K. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22237-22242Google Scholar) which is the general base. Both Met-23 and Met-205 (17Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10935-10939Google Scholar) have also been identified as active site residues although their role in substrate binding or catalysis has not been established. In contrast the type II enzymes are heat-stable dodecamers with a subunit molecular mass of about 16,000 Da (11Kleanthous C. Deka R. Davis K. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Harding S.E. Price N.C. Hawkins A.R. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 687-695Google Scholar); they catalyze a trans elimination of the elements of water (3Harris J. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. Hawkins A.R. Abell C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; : 1080-1081Google Scholar); there are no conserved lysine residues, and they are resistant to inhibition by borohydride treatment. 2C. Kleanthous, R. K. Deka and T. Krell, unpublished results. Clearly the type II enzymes do not use the Schiff-base mechanism, and it has been suggested that the two classes of DHQases are the result of convergent or parallel evolution (18Hawkins A.R. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 491-498Google Scholar). Both the type I and type II enzymes have been crystallized (19Gourley D.G. Coggins J.R. Isaacs N.W. Moore J.D. Charles I.G. Hawkins A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 488-491Google Scholar, 20Boys C.W.G. Bury S.M. Sawyer L. Charles I.G. Hawkins A.R. Deka R.K. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 352-355Google Scholar), and to aid structural analysis we have been using group-specific chemical modification to localize the active sites. Recently we have described a new method, based on electrospray mass spectrometry, for monitoring the modification of proteins by the arginine-directed reagent phenylglyoxal (PGO) (21Krell T. Pitt A.R. Coggins J.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 93-96Google Scholar). This method allows the direct measurement of the amounts of individually modified enzyme species. PGO rapidly inactivates the type II DHQases (21Krell T. Pitt A.R. Coggins J.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 93-96Google Scholar). In the early stages of inactivation only one modified species could be detected that correlated directly with the activity loss. The single site of modification was identified by HPLC-electrospray mass spectrometry-based peptide mapping to be the hyper-reactive residue Arg-23. Here we report the use of this methodology to identify further active site residues in the DHQases. Inactivation with tetranitromethane (TNM) has identified an essential tyrosine in the type II enzymes, and inactivation with PGO has identified a hyper-reactive arginine in the type I enzymes. The essential role of the active site arginine in the type II enzymes has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and a number of mutant enzymes characterized kinetically, by circular dichroism (CD) and by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). This has led to the identification of a structural motif containing these essential amino acids, which is common to both the type I and II DHQases. The type II DHQases from Streptomyces coelicolor (22White P.J. Young J. Hunter I.S. Nimmo H.G. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 735-738Google Scholar) and Aspergillus nidulans (23Da Silva A.J.F. Whittington H. Clements J. Roberts C. Hawkins A.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 481-488Google Scholar) were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (24Beri R.K. Grant S. Roberts C.F. Smith M. Hawkins A.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 337-342Google Scholar). 3P. J. White, G. Young, T. Krell, I. S. Hunter, and J. R. Coggins, manuscript in preparation. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using extinction coefficients calculated from the amino acid compositions (26Gill C.S. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 64: 2090-2095Google Scholar). The E. coli type I DHQase was purified from an overproducing strain according to the procedure of Chaudhuri et al. (6Chaudhuri S. Lambert J.M. McColl L.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 699-704Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined by monitoring the formation of 3-dehydroshikimate at 234 nm (ϵ = 12 × 103M−1 cm−1) at 25°C. The assay mixture for the type I enzyme contained 100 μM ammonium dehydroquinate as substrate in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0); for the type II enzyme of A. nidulans the assay mixture contained 1 mM ammonium dehydroquinate in 50 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.0). The assay for the type II enzyme of S. coelicolor was carried out in 50 mM Tris acetate (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM substrate. Enzyme inactivation reactions were carried out at 25°C in a volume of 2 ml with continuous stirring. Samples of type I and type II DHQase (3 nM) in 100 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.4) were preincubated for 5 min at 25°C, and then PGO (freshly made up 50 mM stock solution in water) was added to a final concentration of 0.5-4.0 mM. Aliquots were removed at various times for enzyme assay. Type II DHQase was preincubated in 0.1 M Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) for 5 min at 25°C, and then TNM (freshly made up stock solution of 15 mM in 95% ethanol) was added to a final concentration of 5-50 μM. Aliquots were removed at various times for enzyme assay. Enzyme inactivated to different extents was prepared for mass spectrometry by stopping the reaction by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column (200 × 17 mm, flow rate 15 ml/h) eluted with 0.5% (w/v) ammonium bicarbonate. To remove low molecular mass contaminants prior to mass spectrometry, the enzyme samples were washed twice by diluting 50-fold with HPLC grade water and reconcentrated using Centricon-10 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, UK). Modified and native DHQase were digested at 37°C. The enzyme in 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate was denatured in 8 M urea for 1 h. Water (37°C) was added to lower the urea concentration to 2 M, and the mixture was incubated with 3% (w/v) trypsin (1 g/liter stock solution in 1 mM HCl) for 4 h. Afterward, another 1% (w/v) trypsin was added and incubation continued for 1 h. Digestion was stopped by freezing the samples at −80°C. Mass spectrometry was performed on a VG Platform quadrupole mass spectrometer fitted with a pneumatically assisted electrospray (ion spray) source and controlled via the VG MassLynx software (VG Biotech Ltd., Altrincham. Cheshire, UK). Carrier solvent (1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile/water, 0.2% formic acid) infusion was controlled at 10 μl/min using a Harvard syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, South Natic, MA). Protein samples were dissolved in carrier solvent at a concentration of 20 pmol/μl, centrifuged at 5000 × g for 2 min, and then 10-20-μl samples injected directly into the carrier stream. Maximum entropy deconvolution (27Ferrige A.G. Seddon M.J. Green B.N. Jarvis S.A. Skilling J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 707-711Google Scholar) was applied for quantitative analysis of the raw data using a 1.0-Da peak width and 1.0-Da/channel resolution. The protein digests were separated by HPLC on a C-4 reverse phase column (2.0 × 150 mm; Delta-pact, Waters, Waterford, Hertfordshire, UK) using 2% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid as the initial solvent (flow rate 0.25 ml/min); after an 8-min wash to remove guanidinium hydrochloride a linear gradient of 2-70% acetonitrile (v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid was applied to elute the peptides. The column eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer with a drying gas flow of 400 liters/h, and the source temperature was set at 100°C. The absorption profile of the eluted peptides was recorded at 214 nm, and centroid mass spectra in the range 400-1800 Da were recorded at 4-s intervals. The plasmid containing the coding sequence of S. coelicolor DHQase cloned into the SmaI site of pIBI25 (Eastman Kodak Co.) (pDHQ) was a gift from Professor Ian S. Hunter, Strathclyde University, Glasgow. Three site-directed mutants (R23K, R23Q, R23A) were prepared using polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis (28Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Google Scholar). Primers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Model 280A DNA synthesizer. The three reverse polymerase chain reaction primers that contained the mismatch codon (highlighted in bold) overlap the BglII site that is located 10 base pairs downstream of arginine residue 23: 5′GTAGATCTCCGGCTGCTTCTGGCCGAGC3′(R23K); 5′GTAGATCTCCGGCTGCGCCTGGCCGAGC3′(R23A); 5′GTAGATCTCCGGCTGCTGCTGGCCGAGC3′ (R23Q). The forward-primer was complementary to a region of the polylinker 190 base pairs upstream and contained an EcoRV site: 5′-CCAGATATCAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGG3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned back into pDHQ replacing the wild-type BglII-EcoRV fragment. The presence of only the desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing on both strands (29Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.H. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Google Scholar). For protein expression the entire mutated sequences were cloned into the NdeI/HindIII site of the expression-plasmid pT7-7 4W. Gilbert (1991) unpublished information, obtained from VecBase 3.0, copyright IBI. and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys(S) (31Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar). The mutant enzyme was purified by following the same protocol as the wild type enzyme. The expression strain used has a native level of type I DHQase. The background activity could be detected as a distinct peak in the eluent of the phenyl-Sepharose column (second column in enzyme purification) and separated completely from mutant enzyme. As a control a fraction of the pure mutant enzyme was incubated at 75°C for 20 min (type II native and mutant enzymes are heat-stable, type I enzyme is not). The enzyme activity before and after the heat treatment was identical. Otherwise, the mutant enzymes were purified and assayed as described above for the native enzyme. Pure mutant enzyme was subjected to ES-MS analysis. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of each protein were recorded in a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. Spectra in the far UV region (260-190 nm) were recorded in cylindrical quartz cells of path length 0.02 cm, and spectra in the near UV region (320-260 nm) were recorded in cells of path length 0.5 cm. The protein concentration was typically 0.5-0.6 mg/ml for far UV work and 5-6 mg/ml for the near UV experiments. All protein solutions were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5). The secondary structure content was determined from the data in the far UV over the range 190-260 nm using the CONTIN procedure (32Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar). Binding of equilibrated substrate/product mixtures to native and mutant DHQase samples at 25°C was determined using a Microcal OMEGA isothermal titration calorimeter following standard ITC procedures (33Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Google Scholar, 34Cooper A. Johnson C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 22: 137-150Google Scholar). Protein samples (about 1 mg/ml), exhaustively dialyzed against 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), were degassed briefly before loading into the ITC cell (about 1.4 ml). Substrate (ammonium dehydroquinate, 50 mM) was dissolved in dialysis buffer together with a trace of native DHQase and incubated at room temperature for 15 h to give an equilibrium mixture of substrate and product prior to loading into the ITC injection syringe. (Note: use of pure substrate in these experiments would result in large heat effects from the enzymatically catalyzed reaction, rather the heats of binding required here.) A typical titration experiment involved a series of up to 25 10-μl injections of ligand (substrate/product mix) into the enzyme solution at 3-min intervals, with continuous stirring. Integrated heat effects, after correction for dilution and mixing controls determined separately under identical conditions, were analyzed by standard techniques using Microcal ORIGIN software assuming 1:1 enzyme-complex formation (32Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar). S. coelicolor DHQase can be inactivated by treatment with the nitrating reagent TNM. This reagent is reasonably specific for tyrosine residues (35Sokolovsky M. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3582-3589Google Scholar). Inactivation followed pseudo-first order kinetics (data not shown). The nitration of the aromatic ring of a tyrosine residue results in a mass increase of +45 Da. Enzyme inactivated to different extents showed only one modified tyrosine residue in the mass spectrometer (Fig. 1, exemplified by 30 and 70% inactivated species). A minor peak that corresponds to an oxidized species could also be detected. To localize the site of modification a 30% inactivated sample was digested with trypsin. A peptide with the mass of 2096.3 Da could be detected that was not present in the tryptic digest of the native enzyme (data not shown). This mass corresponds to peptide 24-42 +45 Da. The sequence contains only one tyrosine residue (Tyr-28) that is conserved in all the type II DHQases (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Sequence alignment of currently available type II and monofunctional type I DHQases. Boxed amino acids form the common motif. Highlighted are the hyper-reactive arginine residues and the essential tyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The type I DHQases, like the type II enzymes, can be inactivated by PGO; in the case of the E. coli enzyme the inactivation follows pseudo-first order kinetics (data not shown). 20% inactivated enzyme showed only one modified species with a mass difference of +116 Da that corresponds to the incorporation of one PGO per reacting site. Native and 20% inactivated enzyme were digested with trypsin, and peptides were separated by HPLC and injected directly into the electrospray mass spectrometer. Trypsin cleaves at unmodified arginine and lysine residues; no cleavage is expected after a modified arginine residue. Recorded spectra were therefore scanned for the theoretical tryptic peptides containing a single internal PGO-modified arginine residue (+116 Da). This tryptic digestion allows the precise location of the site of reaction. Three modified peptides were detected. From the peak size on the HPLC trace it was apparent that two of these modified peptides were only minor species, whereas the third modified peptide was much more abundant. This abundant arginine-containing peptide corresponds to residues 208-229 (Fig. 3A) and identifies Arg-213 as the hyper-reactive arginine residue (Fig. 2). Peptides 208-213 and 214-229 are shown to demonstrate that the protease cuts the unmodified enzyme species at Arg-213 (Fig. 3B and 3C). The double peak in Fig. 3C is due to the occurrence in the tryptic digest of a second peptide (26Gill C.S. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 64: 2090-2095Google Scholar, 27Ferrige A.G. Seddon M.J.

Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar) that has exactly the same mass as peptide 208-213; these peptides have different mobilities on reverse phase HPLC. The secondary sites of modification are at residues 38 and 48. The tryptic digest of native enzyme did not contain species with masses corresponding to the PGO-modified peptides. The hyper-reactive arginine (Arg-23) of S. coelicolor DHQase (21Krell T. Pitt A.R. Coggins J.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 93-96Google Scholar) was replaced by a lysine, glutamine, and alanine residue. The masses of purified mutant proteins were determined using ES-MS. All three masses were found to be very close to the theoretical values: 16,467.00 ± 1.55 Da for R23A (theoretically 16,465.56 Da), 16,522.79 ± 1.18 Da for R23Q (theoretically 16,522.61 Da), and 16,523.87 ± 2.33 Da for R23K (theoretically 16,522.66 Da). Evidence from far UV CD spectroscopy (Fig. 4A, Table I) demonstrates that the secondary structure of the protein was not altered significantly by the mutations. Only the R23Q mutation lead to a small detectable change in the β-sheet content (Table I). The near UV CD spectra (Fig. 4B) also confirm that the tertiary structures of the mutant enzymes are very similar to the wild-type, although there are some small differences in the 270-285 nm region suggesting a subtle change in the environment of one or more tyrosine side chains.Table IEstimation of secondary structure elements of native and mutant S. coelicolor DHQase (using the CONTIN procedures (32Provencher S.W.

The Km values were calculated using a Lineweaver-Burk plot, and the mutant enzyme activity was determined as described above for the wild-type enzyme. Surprisingly, the Km values of the mutant enzymes were found to be lower than those of the wild-type enzyme. This apparent increased affinity for substrate was confirmed by isothermal titration experiments of enzyme species with an equilibrated substrate/product mixture as illustrated in Fig. 5 and Table III. With wild-type enzyme the heat effects were relatively small but, after correction for dilution heat effects, consistent with weak exothermic 1:1 enzyme-substrate complex formation (Kapp≈5 mM, see Table III). In marked contrast, addition of substrate to mutant proteins gave significantly more exothermic initial heat effects, which decreased rapidly with subsequent injections in a manner consistent with much tighter binding (Kapp≈0.3-1 mM; Fig. 5B and Table III).Table IIThe kinetic parameters of native and mutant S. coelicolor DHQasekcatKmkcat/Kms−1μms−1 m−1Wild-type96011008.7 × 105R23K0.352501400R23Q0.311352300R23A0.032170188 Open table in a new tab Table IIIApparent DHQase-substrate binding parameters of wild-type and mutant S. coelicolor DHQase determined from calorimetric titrations assuming 1:1 complex formationKappΔHappmMkJ mol−1Wild-type5.40−11R23K1.10−25R23Q0.33−24R23A0.30−29 Open table in a new tab Both chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved hyper-reactive arginine residue in the type II DHQases (Arg-23 in the S. coelicolor enzyme) lead to loss of enzyme activity. Arginine residues with hyper-reactivity toward α-1,2-dicarbonyls such as PGO are often found to be involved in carboxylate binding. Such residues are located in special microenvironments and have lower pKa values than other arginine residues (36Patthy L. Thesz J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 387-393Google Scholar, 37Riordan J.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1979; 6: 71-92Google Scholar). Three mutants were made of the hyper-reactive Arg-23 of S. coelicolor DHQase, R23K, R23Q, and R23A. Mass spectrometry and CD analysis revealed that the mutants were of the expected size and had the same or very similar secondary structure as the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4, Table I). All three mutants showed a much smaller turnover number (kcat), with R23K being in the same range as R23Q and with R23A still being another order of magnitude less active (Table II). In contrast a decrease in Km values was observed, by a factor of 4 for the R23K mutant and by factors of 8 and 6 for the R23Q and R23A proteins, respectively (Table II). This behavior was also confirmed more directly by calorimetric binding studies, which showed that binding of substrate was significantly enhanced by replacement of Arg-23 with Lys, Gln, or Ala, as indicated by a 5-10-fold decrease in the apparent binding constant (Kapp) and significantly more exothermic binding. Direct comparison of Kapp with Km values is not strictly appropriate because Km values relate to initial substrate binding rather than the equilibrated substrate/product mixture used for calorimetric experiments. They are, in any case, only related to substrate binding affinities within the validity of the Michaelis-Menten approximation. Nevertheless, Km and Kapp are of the same order of magnitude and, more importantly, show the same trends in the mutant enzyme. In other enzymes, where arginine residues are known to be involved in the recognition of substrates containing carboxyl groups, arginine mutation leads to a large increase in Km (25Van Berkel W. Westphal A. Eschrich K. Eppink M. De Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 411-419Google Scholar, 38Taguchi H. Ohta T. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 930-936Google Scholar). Our results therefore suggest that Arg-23 is not simply involved in substrate recognition but must have a catalytic role. One possibility is that a positive charge is required to stabilize a negative transition state such as an enolate. Although the R23K mutant retains the positive charge, the position of this charge will be significantly altered in the mutant. The full interpretation of this result must await the determination of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. Chemical modification has also identified Tyr-28 as a residue in or near the active site. Both Arg-23 and Tyr-28 are conserved in all type II DHQases (Fig. 2). The small changes observed in the near UV CD spectra (Fig. 4B) of the arginine mutant proteins can be explained by a change in the environment of a tyrosine residue. The proximity in the sequence of Arg-23 and Tyr-28 and the occurrence of these small spectral changes when the arginine is altered are both consistent with these residues being spatially close. Chemical modification experiments on the type I DHQases have also identified a hyper-reactive arginine (Arg-213 in the E. coli enzyme) that appears to be essential for activity and is near the methionine residue previously identified as an active site residue (17Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10935-10939Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences around the hyper-reactive arginine residues of the two classes of enzyme (Fig. 2) indicates that there is a conserved structural motif, extending over 9 residues, shown by the shaded region in Fig. 2. In the type I enzymes the essential tyrosine residue identified by TNM modification in the type II enzymes is replaced by a phenylalanine residue. Both the mechanistic experiments (3Harris J. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. Hawkins A.R. Abell C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; : 1080-1081Google Scholar, 13Shneier A. Kleanthous C. Deka R. Coggins J.R. Abell C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9416-9418Google Scholar) and the sequence comparisons (11Kleanthous C. Deka R. Davis K. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Harding S.E. Price N.C. Hawkins A.R. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 687-695Google Scholar, 30Duncan K. Chaudhuri S. Campbell M.S. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 475-483Google Scholar) have suggested that these two classes of enzyme are likely to be structurally very different, and it will therefore be interesting to see whether this sequence similarity is reflected in a common substrate binding fold at the active centers of these two classes of enzyme.

Using a series of site-specific mutations and deletions of the proximal rPRL promoter we have mapped the major Ras/Raf response element (RRE) to a composite Ets-1/GHF-1 binding site located between positions −217 and −190. Mutation of either the Ets-1 or GHF-1 binding sites inhibits Ras and Raf activation of the rPRL promoter, and insertion of this RRE into the rat growth hormone promoter confers Ras responsiveness. We show that Ets-1 is expressed in GH4 cells and, consistent with their functional synergistic interaction, both Ets-1 and GHF-1 are able to bind specifically to this bipartite RRE. We confirm that Ets-1 or a related Ets factor is the nuclear target of the Ras pathway leading to activation of the rPRL promoter and demonstrate that Elk-1 and Net do not mediate the Ras response. Thus, the pituitary-specific POU homeodomain transcription factor, GHF-1, serves as a cell-specific signal integrator by functionally interacting with an Ets-1-like factor, at uniquely juxtaposed binding sites, thereby targeting an otherwise ubiquitous Ras signaling pathway to a select subset of cell-specific GHF-1-dependent genes.

INTRODUCTIONThe p21 Ras proto-oncogene is a critical component of a network of signaling pathways that mediate the control of cell growth, metabolism, and differentiation (1Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Google Scholar) Signals initiated at transmembrane receptors are transduced via Ras and propagated, by a phosphorylation cascade, to the nucleus, resulting in changes in the activity of specific transcription factors (2Gutman A. Wasylyk B. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 49-54Google Scholar, 3Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Google Scholar). Distinct signaling components of the Ras pathway may be present in different cell types, allowing the signal to be interpreted in a cell-specific manner (4Feig L.A. Science. 1993; 260: 767-768Google Scholar, 5Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 52-56Google Scholar) Indeed, cell-specific, phenotypic sequelae of Ras activation are exemplified by the differential effects of oncogenic Ras in PC12 pheochromocytoma, TT medullary carcinoma, and FRTL5 thyroid cells (6Avvedimento V.E.

Thus, the characterization of cell-specific endogenous nuclear factors that may act as effectors of the Ras signaling pathway and the identification of specific Ras-responsive cis-acting DNA elements are important unanswered questions.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921Google Scholar), and dominant-negative Ets constructs inhibit both Ras-induced mitogenesis (10Langer S.J. Bortner D.M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5355-5362Google Scholar) and transformation (11Wasylyk C. Maira S.-M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673Google Scholar). The serum response is governed by MAP kinase phosphorylation of Elk-1, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors (12Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Google Scholar, 13Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Google Scholar), thus facilitating its interaction with serum response factor (SRF). Similarly, the Drosophila Ets factors, Pointed and Yan (14Brunner D. Ducker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klambt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Google Scholar, 15O'Neill E.M. Rebay I. Tjian R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Google Scholar) are also regulated by the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway.A number of RREs contain AP-1-like elements (18Owen R.D. Bortner D.M. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8670-8674Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transcription potency of both c-Fos and c-Jun is enhanced by phosphorylation catalyzed by Ras-activated protein kinases (21Binétruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Google Scholar, 22Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Google Scholar), and a transdominant Jun factor is able to suppress transformation of cells by Ras (23Lloyd A. Yancheva N. Wasylyk B. Nature. 1991; 352: 635-638Google Scholar). Other RREs contain a cAMP response element (CRE) (24Galien R. Mercier G. Garcette M. Emanoil-Ravier R.

Bonni A. Greenberg M. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Google Scholar). Finally, the oncogene response units of certain cellular genes consists of binding sites for both AP-1 and Ets factors (27Bruder J.T.

Cell. 1988; 55: 519-529Google Scholar). We have previously shown that oncogenic V-12 Ras selectively activates the rPRL promoter in GH4 cells and that the Ras signal is not transduced via protein kinase C or protein kinase A. Indeed, in our pituitary model system, the Ras and protein kinase A/protein kinase C signaling pathways are mutually antagonistic (33Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1279-1286Google Scholar, 34Oberwetter J.M. Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 915-923Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of c-Jun inhibits Ras activation of the proximal rPRL promoter (34Oberwetter J.M. Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 915-923Google Scholar), which does not contain any DNA sequences homologous to canonical CRE or AP-1 sites (32Conrad K.E. Oberwetter J.M. Vallaincourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Google Scholar). Recent evidence from this laboratory indicates a critical role for the transcription factor Ets-1 in Ras activation of the rPRL promoter (32Conrad K.E. Oberwetter J.M. Vallaincourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Google Scholar) and demonstrates that a functional interaction of Ets-1 and GHF-1 is required for an optimal Ras response (31Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Google Scholar). Additionally we have proposed that an Ets binding site (EBS) adjacent to a GHF-1 binding site (footprint IV (FPIV)), spanning positions −217 to −190, functions as a composite rPRL promoter RRE. However, a recent report has implicated a more proximal region of the rPRL promoter, (−165 to −150), also containing a composite EBS/GHF-1 site, as being capable of conferring Ras responsiveness on a heterologous promoter construct (40Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20930-20936Google Scholar). Thus, in the studies presented here, we determine the precise cis-acting DNA sequences and transacting factors, within the context of the proximal rPRL promoter, that are necessary and sufficient for Ras activation. We utilized a series of site-specific mutations and deletions in the proximal rPRL promoter to precisely map the principal and physiologically relevant RRE to the composite Ets-1/GHF-1 binding site spanning positions −217 to −190. Furthermore, we show, using immunological and electrophoretic mobility shift techniques, that GH4 rat pituitary cells express both GHF-1 and c-Ets-1 and that both factors exhibit specific binding to this composite RRE. In contrast, the more proximal element (−165 to −150) (40Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20930-20936Google Scholar) was not functionally relevant for Ras or Raf activation in the context of an intact rPRL promoter.Thus, the interaction of a widely expressed transcription factor, Ets-1, with the pituitary-specific POU homeodomain factor GHF-1 at a unique cis-element provides a molecular mechanism by which the ubiquitous Ras signaling pathway can selectively regulate expression of a cell-specific gene. INTRODUCTIONThe p21 Ras proto-oncogene is a critical component of a network of signaling pathways that mediate the control of cell growth, metabolism, and differentiation (1Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Google Scholar) Signals initiated at transmembrane receptors are transduced via Ras and propagated, by a phosphorylation cascade, to the nucleus, resulting in changes in the activity of specific transcription factors (2Gutman A. Wasylyk B. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 49-54Google Scholar, 3Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Google Scholar). Distinct signaling components of the Ras pathway may be present in different cell types, allowing the signal to be interpreted in a cell-specific manner (4Feig L.A. Science. 1993; 260: 767-768Google Scholar, 5Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 52-56Google Scholar) Indeed, cell-specific, phenotypic sequelae of Ras activation are exemplified by the differential effects of oncogenic Ras in PC12 pheochromocytoma, TT medullary carcinoma, and FRTL5 thyroid cells (6Avvedimento V.E. Musti A.M. Ueffing M. Obici S. Gallo A. Sanchez M. DeBrasi D. Gottesman M.E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 22-28Google Scholar, 7Lacal J.C. Cuadrado A. Jones J.E. Trotta R. Burstein D.E. Thomson T.

A. 1987; 84: 5923-5927Google Scholar), whereby V-12 Ras induces terminal differentiation of the first two cell lines but causes transformation of the last. Thus, the characterization of cell-specific endogenous nuclear factors that may act as effectors of the Ras signaling pathway and the identification of specific Ras-responsive cis-acting DNA elements are important unanswered questions.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Google Scholar).Tandem c-Ets-2 binding sites have been shown to confer Ras responsiveness in NIH-3T3 cells (9Galang C. Der C. Hauser C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921Google Scholar), and dominant-negative Ets constructs inhibit both Ras-induced mitogenesis (10Langer S.J. Bortner D.M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell.

The serum response is governed by MAP kinase phosphorylation of Elk-1, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors (12Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Google Scholar, 13Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Google Scholar), thus facilitating its interaction with serum response factor (SRF). Similarly, the Drosophila Ets factors, Pointed and Yan (14Brunner D. Ducker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klambt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Google Scholar, 15O'Neill E.M. Rebay I. Tjian R.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8670-8674Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transcription potency of both c-Fos and c-Jun is enhanced by phosphorylation catalyzed by Ras-activated protein kinases (21Binétruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Google Scholar, 22Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Google Scholar), and a transdominant Jun factor is able to suppress transformation of cells by Ras (23Lloyd A. Yancheva N. Wasylyk B. Nature. 1991; 352: 635-638Google Scholar). Other RREs contain a cAMP response element (CRE) (24Galien R. Mercier G. Garcette M. Emanoil-Ravier R.

Bonni A. Greenberg M. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Google Scholar). Finally, the oncogene response units of certain cellular genes consists of binding sites for both AP-1 and Ets factors (27Bruder J.T.

Thus, in the studies presented here, we determine the precise cis-acting DNA sequences and transacting factors, within the context of the proximal rPRL promoter, that are necessary and sufficient for Ras activation. We utilized a series of site-specific mutations and deletions in the proximal rPRL promoter to precisely map the principal and physiologically relevant RRE to the composite Ets-1/GHF-1 binding site spanning positions −217 to −190. Furthermore, we show, using immunological and electrophoretic mobility shift techniques, that GH4 rat pituitary cells express both GHF-1 and c-Ets-1 and that both factors exhibit specific binding to this composite RRE. In contrast, the more proximal element (−165 to −150) (40Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20930-20936Google Scholar) was not functionally relevant for Ras or Raf activation in the context of an intact rPRL promoter. Thus, the interaction of a widely expressed transcription factor, Ets-1, with the pituitary-specific POU homeodomain factor GHF-1 at a unique cis-element provides a molecular mechanism by which the ubiquitous Ras signaling pathway can selectively regulate expression of a cell-specific gene.

It is unknown whether angiotensin II and arginine vasopressin, potent vasoconstrictor agents, influence intracellular Mg2+. The effects of angiotensin II and vasopressin on intracellular free Mg2+ concentrations ([Mg2+]i) were therefore investigated in primary cultured unpassaged vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from mesenteric arteries of Wistar Kyoto rats, and in an established cell line of rat thoracic aorta cells (A10 cells). Underlying mechanisms of agonist-stimulated [Mg2+]i changes were assessed in A10 cells by pharmacologically manipulating phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and the Na+/H+ exchanger. In addition, the dependence of [Mg2+]i on intracellular Ca2+ was determined. [Mg2+]i was measured in single cells by fluorescent digital imaging using mag-fura-2/AM. Basal [Mg2+]i levels in Wistar Kyoto rat and A10 cells were 0.62 ± 0.02 mmol/liter and 0.58 ± 0.01 mmol/liter, respectively. Angiotensin II and vasopressin induced a dose-dependent biphasic [Mg2+]i response where [Mg2+]i increased rapidly and transiently to a peak level and then declined to subbasal levels, which were sustained. Preexposure of cells to neomycin, a nonspecific phospholipase C inhibitor, U-73122, a selective phospholipase C inhibitor, calphostin C, a selective protein kinase C inhibitor, and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride, a selective Na+/H+ exchange blocker, attenuated angiotensin II- and vasopressin-induced [Mg2+]i responses in a concentration-dependent manner. Removal of extracellular Na+ completely inhibited agonist-elicited [Mg2+]i transients. To determine whether intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) influences agonist-induced [Mg2+]i changes, thapsigargin, a selective sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, was used to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores. In thapsigargin-pretreated cells, angiotensin II-elicited [Ca2+]i responses were significantly attenuated, whereas agonist-induced [Mg2+]i responses were unchanged. These data demonstrate that in primary cultured VSMC and in an established VSMC line, angiotensin II and vasopressin modulate [Mg2+]i through receptor-mediated pathways, which are [Ca2+]i-independent but which involve phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and the Na+/H+ exchanger. These pathways are linked to a Na+-dependent Mg2+ transporter, which facilitates transmembrane Mg2+ transport. Vasoactive peptides mobilize cytosolic free Mg2+ in vascular smooth muscle cells.

These pathways are linked to a Na+-dependent Mg2+ transporter, which facilitates transmembrane Mg2+ transport. Magnesium, one of the most abundant intracellular cations, plays a major role in cell function (1Aikawa J.K. World Rev. Nutr. Diet. 1978; 28: 112-142Google Scholar, 2Walker G.M. Magnesium. 1986; 531: 201-217Google Scholar). Free magnesium is a vital cofactor for many enzymes, especially those involved in the transfer of phosphate groups (3Grubbs R.D. Maguire M.E. Magnesium. 1987; 6: 113-127Google Scholar). It is essential for Na+ and Ca2+ pump activity, it regulates the Na+, K+, and Cl−/K+ cotransporting systems, and it influences ionic traffic through Ca2+, K+, and Na+ channels (4Pusch M. Conti F. Stuhmer W. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1267-1271Google Scholar, 5Hartzell H.C. White R.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 745-767Google Scholar, 6Volpe P. Alderson-Long B.H. Nickols G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1077-C1085Google Scholar). Cytosolic magnesium regulates the activity of many enzymes involved in intracellular signal transduction and is a modulator of the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) (6Volpe P. Alderson-Long B.H. Nickols G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1077-C1085Google Scholar, 7Litosch I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4764-4771Google Scholar, 8Zhang A. Cheng T.P.O. Altura B.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 25-29Google Scholar), which is a major determinant of contraction and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle (9Hathaway D.R. March K.L. Lash J.A. Adam L.P. Wilensky R.L. Circulation. 1991; 83: 382-390Google Scholar). Thus, magnesium may play a physiological role in modulating vascular tone and blood pressure through its effects on [Ca2+]i. Factors that regulate the intracellular free Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i) are poorly understood, and little is known about [Mg2+]i responses elicited by vasoconstrictor agonists. Recent studies have demonstrated that Mg2+ is an active and mobile cation that moves between cytosolic compartments (10Grubbs R.D. Walter A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 136: 11-22Google Scholar, 11Quamme G.A. Dai L.-J. Rabkin S.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: 4281-4288Google Scholar, 12Murphy E. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1993; 19: 250-258Google Scholar). In the past, technical difficulties did not allow the precise measurement of [Mg2+]i. However, with the recent development of mag-fura-2/AM, a fluorescent dye, [Mg2+]i can now be accurately determined in single living cells (12Murphy E. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1993; 19: 250-258Google Scholar). Basal [Mg2+]i in various cell types ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 mmol/liter (13Flatman P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 259-271Google Scholar, 14Schachter M. Gallagher K.L. Sever P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 378-380Google Scholar). Although mechanisms involved in the maintenance of [Mg2+]i at optimal concentrations are unclear, it is apparent that multiple pathways are probably involved. Magnesium enters cells passively along a concentration gradient (15Murphy E. Freudenrich C.C. Lieberman M. Annu Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 273-287Google Scholar) and by facilitated diffusion (16Page E. Polimeni P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1972; 224: 121-139Google Scholar) and is extruded from cells via two possible transporters, Na+/Mg2+ exchange and Mg2+-ATPase (13Flatman P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 259-271Google Scholar, 17Snavely M.D. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 815-823Google Scholar). The Na+/Mg2+ exchanger was first demonstrated in the squid giant axon where Na+ moving into the cell down its electrochemical gradient is coupled to Mg2+ moving out of the cell (18Baker P.F. Crawford A.C. J. Physiol. 1972; 227: 855-874Google Scholar). Na+-dependent Mg2+ transport is inhibited by amiloride, quinidine, imipramine, and manganese, and it may be linked to protein kinase C and the Na+/H+ antiporter (19Lüdi H. Schatzmann H.J. J. Physiol. 1987; 390: 367-382Google Scholar, 20Gunther T. Vormann J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 540-545Google Scholar). A P-type ATPase has recently been cloned from bacteria and has been implicated in Mg2+ transport; however, the specific nature and function of this enzyme awaits clarification (21Hmiel S.P. Snavely M.D. Miller C.G. Maguire M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1444-1450Google Scholar). Within cells, Mg2+ is compartmentalized in nuclei, mitochondria, and endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum and is highly regulated by intracellular buffering processes as well as by various circulating agents (22Romani A. Marfella C. Scarpa A. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1139-1148Google Scholar). Cellular stimulation by agonists induces variable [Mg2+]i responses. Endothelin-1, carbachol, isoproterenol, and phorbol esters increase Mg2+ influx and [Mg2+]i (22Romani A. Marfella C. Scarpa A. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1139-1148Google Scholar, 23Gunther T. Vormann J. Hollriegl V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 333-336Google Scholar, 24Grubbs R.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12550-12554Google Scholar, 25Okada K. Ishikawa S.-E. Saito T. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C873-C878Google Scholar), whereas norepinephrine and epinephrine stimulate Mg2+ efflux and decrease [Mg2+]i (26Romani A. Scarpa A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 37-40Google Scholar). The nonfluorescent ionophore of divalent cations A23187, induces a transient elevation in [Mg2+]i followed by a reduction to subbasal levels (11Quamme G.A. Dai L.-J. Rabkin S.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: 4281-4288Google Scholar), whereas arginine vasopressin (AVP) 1The abbreviations used are: AVParginine vasopressinAng IIangiotensin IIdDAVP[1-deamino,8-D-arginine]AVPHMA5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amilorideWKYWistar Kyoto. has been demonstrated to have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on [Mg2+]i (25Okada K. Ishikawa S.-E. Saito T. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C873-C878Google Scholar, 27Bond M. Vadasz G. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15630-15636Google Scholar). Although these previous studies suggest that vasoactive agonists affect the transmembrane kinetics of Mg2+, nothing is known about the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on vascular smooth muscle [Mg2+]i responses. Ang II and AVP, which mediate cellular responses through specific G-protein-coupled membrane receptors (AT1 and AT2 receptors for Ang II, and V1 and V2 receptors for AVP), are among the most potent vasoconstrictors identified (28Altura B.M. Altura B.T. Fed. Proc. 1977; 36: 1853-1860Google Scholar). Ligand-receptor interaction results in phospholipase C activation and production of the two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, which mobilizes calcium from intracellular stores, and 1,2-diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C. These agonist-stimulated pathways may also play a role in modulating intracellular [Mg2+]i. Despite extensive data in the literature regarding Ca2+ effects of vasoactive peptides, little is known about the relationship between vasoconstrictor agonists and [Mg2+]i in vascular smooth muscle cells. arginine vasopressin angiotensin II [1-deamino,8-D-arginine]AVP 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride Wistar Kyoto. The present study investigates effects of Ang II and AVP on [Mg2+]i transients in primary cultured unpassaged vascular smooth muscle cells and in an established cultured vascular smooth muscle cell line (A10 cells). Cellular mechanisms underlying Ang II- and AVP-induced [Mg2+]i changes were assessed in A10 cells by pharmacologically manipulating phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and the Na+/H+ exchanger. Since transmembrane Mg2+ transport may be linked to a Na+-dependent transporter, we also assessed agonist-induced [Mg2+]i responses in the absence of extracellular Na+. To determine whether [Ca2+]i influences [Mg2+]i, agonist-induced responses were assessed in cells that had been pretreated with thapsigargin, a selective reticular Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, that depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores by blocking Ca2+-ATPase-dependent Ca2+ reuptake. [Mg2+]i was measured using the fluorescent dye mag-fura-2/AM. Mag-fura-2 contains the same fluorophore utilized in the calcium-sensitive indicator fura-2 and exhibits fluorescence changes on magnesium complexation that are similar to those observed on complexation of Ca2+ by fura-2. Although Ca2+ binds to mag-fura-2 and the affinity of mag-fura-2 for Ca2+ is slightly greater than that for Mg2+, the physiological Mg2+ concentration (in the millimolar range) is significantly greater than that of ionized calcium (in the nanomolar range), so that interference arising from cytosolic Ca2+ elevation is only likely to occur under very extreme conditions, for example when [Ca2+]i is greater than 4 μmol/liter (29Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C546Google Scholar). Since the [Ca2+]i in our studies never reached concentrations above 1 μmol/liter and because Ca2+ does not bind to mag-fura-2 in the physiological range, the fluorescence of mag-fura-2 in this study is considered to be associated specifically with changes in [Mg2+]i. Mag-fura-2/AM, mag-fura-2 tetrapotassium salt, fura-2/AM, fura-2 pentapotassium salt, and pluronic F-127 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Thapsigargin, neomycin, and calphostin C were from Calbiochem, and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride was from Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA). The selective phospholipase C inhibitor, 1-[6-[[17-β-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10Grubbs R.D. Walter A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 136: 11-22Google Scholar)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122) was from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth, PA). Angiotensin II, [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, vasopressin, [β-mercapto-β,β-cyclopentamethylene propionyl1,MeO-Tyr2,Arg8]AVP, and [1-deamino-8-D-arginine]AVP were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Losartan and PD 123319 were from DuPont and Parke-Davis (Ann Arbor, MI), respectively. All other chemicals were from Sigma and Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). Adult Wistar Kyoto rats (n = 21) were killed by decapitation. Vascular smooth muscle cells were cultured from mesenteric arteries of rats according to previously described techniques (30Schiffrin E.L. Poissant L. Cantin M. Thibault G. Life Sci. 1986; 38: 817-826Google Scholar). Briefly, mesenteric arteries (the main mesenteric vessel as well as first- and second-order branches) were cleaned of all adipose and connective tissue. Smooth muscle cells were dissociated by digestion of vascular arcades with 0.12 mg/ml elastase, 2 mg/ml collagenase (type 1), 0.36 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin in Ham's F-12 medium for 60 min at 37°C. The tissue was filtered through a 100-μm nylon mesh, and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 200 g and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, 2 mmol/liter L-glutamine, 20 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Vascular smooth muscle cells were grown on round glass coverslips (25-mm diameter) in plastic six-well dishes and maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Cells were grown to confluence (usually 7-10 days after plating), at which time they were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation and maintained in a serum-free medium for 36 h before experimentation. At confluence the cells had the typical “hill and valley” pattern. These cells test positive for smooth muscle cell α-actin, indicating the absence of contamination by other vascular cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Cells were not passaged, and only primary cultured unpassaged cells were studied. In addition to studying primary cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, an established cell line of rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (A10 cells) was also studied. A10 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were seeded on round glass coverslips in plastic six-well multiwell dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described above. Cells were studied 5-7 days after plating, at which stage they had reached confluence. Confluent cell cultures were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation and maintenance in a serum-free medium for 36 h before experimentation. The cells, which had been grown on glass coverslips, were washed three times with 2 ml of modified Hanks' buffered saline solution containing (in mmol/liter) 137 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 4.2 NaHCO3, 3 Na2HPO4, 0.4 KH2PO4, 1.3 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, 10 glucose, 5 Hepes, pH 7.4. The washed cells were loaded with mag-fura-2/AM (5 μmol/liter), which was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide with 0.02% pluronic acid. The final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration was less than 0.1% and had no effect on basal [Mg2+]i levels. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a humidified incubator (95% air, 5% CO2). The loaded cells were then washed three times with warmed (37°C) buffer and incubated for a further 15 min to ensure complete deesterification. Cells were finally washed once with fresh buffer. Under these loading conditions, the ratiometric (343/380 nm) fluorescence cell images were homogeneous, indicating that there was no significant intracellular compartmentation of mag-fura-2. The coverslip containing cells was placed in a stainless steel chamber and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135, Zeiss, West Germany). Four glass rings (4-5-mm diameter) were placed on the coverslip according to previously described methods (31Touyz R.M. Tolloczko B. Schiffrin E.L. J. Hypertens. 1994; 12: 663-673Google Scholar). This allowed for four separate experiments for each coverslip. Intracellular free Mg2+ concentration was measured in multiple cells simultaneously by fluorescent digital imaging using an Axiovert 135 inverted microscope (Zeiss, West Germany) and Attofluor Digital Fluorescence system (Attofluor Ratiovision, Zeiss, Germany). An emission wavelength of 520 nm and alternating excitatory wavelengths of 343 and 380 nm were used to measure mag-fura-2 fluorescence (11Quamme G.A. Dai L.-J. Rabkin S.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: 4281-4288Google Scholar, 29Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C546Google Scholar). The Attofluor system was calibrated by viewing mag-fura-2 tetrapotassium salt solutions containing zero and saturating magnesium concentrations and including these data in the ratio calculations for construction of a standard curve relating magnesium concentration to the 343:380 ratio. The curve was derived from the following equation: [Mg2+]i (in mmol/liter) = Kd ((R − Rmin)/(Rmax− R)] ×β (29Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C546Google Scholar, 32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar), where R is the ratio of fluorescence at 343 and 380 nm, Rmax and Rmin are the ratios for mag-fura-free acid at 343 and 380 nm in the presence of saturating magnesium and zero magnesium, respectively, and β is the ratio of fluorescence of mag-fura-2 at 380 nm in zero and saturating magnesium. Kd is the dissociation constant of mag-fura-2 for Mg2+ and is assumed to be 1.5 mmol/liter (29Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C546Google Scholar). Video images of fluorescence at 520-nm emission were obtained using an intensified charge-coupled device camera system (Zeiss) with the output digitized to a resolution of 512 × 480 pixels. Images of fluorescence ratios were then obtained by dividing, pixel by pixel, the 343-nm image after background subtraction by the 380-nm image after background subtraction. In some experiments [Ca2+]i was measured. The method used has been detailed previously (31Touyz R.M. Tolloczko B. Schiffrin E.L. J. Hypertens. 1994; 12: 663-673Google Scholar) and was similar to that for [Mg2+]i described above. Briefly, cells were loaded with 4 μmol/liter fura-2/AM and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37°C in the dark for 30 min. [Ca2+]i was measured in washed cells. Fura-2-pentapotassium salt was used for [Ca2+]i calibration and the absolute Ca2+ concentration was determined from the Grynkiewicz formula as stated above for [Mg2+]i. The Kd for the fura-2-Ca2+ complex was assumed to be 224 nmol/liter (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). Effects of Ang II and AVP (10−12 to 10−5 mol/liter) on [Mg]i were assessed in primary cultured cells and in A10 cells. Many cells (5-15 cells/experimental field) were studied simultaneously. Once a stable base line had been recorded (typically within 60-90 s of recording), Ang II or AVP (dissolved in 50 μl of buffer at the concentration required to obtain the final desired concentration) was added to the 50 μl of buffer contained within the glass ring that isolated the cells under investigation. To confirm that agonist-induced responses were receptor-mediated, effects of 10−8 mol/liter Ang II were determined in cells that had been preexposed for 10 min to 10−6 mol/liter [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II (Ang II receptor antagonist), losartan (selective AT1 receptor antagonist), or PD 123319 (selective AT2 receptor antagonist). To determine the receptor subtype (V1 or V2) through which AVP mediates its effect, the potent and selective V1 antagonist [β-mercapto-β,β-cyclopentamethylene propionyl1,MeO-Tyr2,Arg8]AVP and V2 agonist [1-deamino,8-D-arginine]AVP (dDAVP) were used. Cells were preexposed to the V1 receptor antagonist (10−6 mol/liter) for 10 min before adding 10−8 mol/liter AVP. Effects of dDAVP on [Mg2+]i were assessed at a concentration of 10−6 mol/liter. Cells were used for single experiments, and no repetitive determinations were performed. Mechanisms underlying agonist-induced [Mg2+]i changes were examined in A10 cells. In these experiments, cells were preexposed for 10 min to the nonspecific phospholipase C inhibitor, neomycin (10−5 to 10−1 mol/liter) (33Schwertz D.W. Kreisberg J.I. Venkatachalam M.A. J. Pharmacol.

Biol. 1988; 105: 1-21Google Scholar) (10−11 to 10−6 mol/liter) prior to the addition of Ang II or AVP (final concentration, 10−8 nmol/liter). To determine whether agonist-induced [Mg2+]i changes were linked to a Na+-dependent transporter, Ang II and AVP responses were also determined in the absence of extracellular Na+, where Na+ was replaced by choline chloride. The dependence of [Mg2+]i on [Ca2+]i was assessed by measuring Ang II-induced [Mg2+]i responses in cells that had been depleted of intracellular Ca2+ stores. This was attained by preexposing cells to a selective reticular Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (37Low A.M. Darby P.J. Kwan C.Y. Daniel E.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 230: 53-62Google Scholar) (10−6 mol/liter) for 10 min, prior to the addition of Ang II (10−8 mol/liter). To establish that Ca2+ stores were depleted by thapsigargin, Ca2+ responses to Ang II (10−8 mol/liter) were determined in thapsigargin pretreated cells. Mean values were calculated for multiple cells in each experiment, and then the mean of the experiments was determined and used for analysis. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparison of mean values was performed by Student's t test where appropriate or by analysis of variance followed by Tukey Kramer's correction for multiple testing. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Concentration-response curves were fitted by nonlinear regression, the concentration (in mol/liter) giving 50% inhibition of response (IC50) was determined, and pI2 was calculated as −log IC50. Intracellular free Mg2+ concentration in resting unstimulated primary cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from WKY rats was 0.62 ± 0.02 mmol/liter, which was similar to basal [Mg2+]i in A10 cells (0.58 ± 0.01 mmol/liter). Ang II and AVP at increasing concentrations elicited a biphasic [Mg2+]i response. Upon exposure to these peptides, [Mg2+]i increased rapidly and acutely. However, the increase was transient, because once peak [Mg2+]i was obtained (~0.8 mmol/liter), [Mg2+]i decreased rapidly to subbasal levels. Agonist-induced reduction in [Mg2+]i was sustained, and even after 300 s [Mg2+]i was lower than basal levels. Effects elicited by Ang II and AVP were dose-dependent (Fig. 1). The pI2 for Ang II in WKY rat cells was 8.0 ± 0.3, similar to that in A10 cells (7.6 ± 0.6). The pI2 for AVP was 6.6 ± 1.0. At concentrations below 10−10 mol/liter, Ang II and AVP failed to induce significant [Mg2+]i responses. In cells preexposed to the Ang II receptor antagonist [Sar1-Ile8]Ang II and to the AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan, Ang II failed to elicit changes in [Mg2+]i transients (Table I). PD 123319 had no effect on Ang II-stimulated [Mg2+]i (Table I). In cells preexposed to the V1 antagonist ([β-mercapto-β-β-cyclopentamethylene propionyl1,MeO-Tyr2,Arg8]AVP), AVP did not alter [Mg2+]i (Table I). Pretreatment of cells with the receptor antagonists in the absence of agonist did not affect basal [Mg2+]i (Table I).

The difference between infrared spectra of the nAChR recorded using the attenuated total reflectance technique in the presence and absence of the neurotransmitter analog, carbamylcholine, exhibits a complex pattern of positive and negative bands that provides a spectral map of the structural changes that occur in the nAChR upon ligand binding and subsequent desensitization. This spectral map is essentially identical in difference spectra recorded from native, native alkaline-extracted, and affinity-purified nAChR reconstituted into either soybean asolectin or egg phosphatidylcholine membranes containing both neutral and anionic lipids. This result suggests both a similar structure of the nAChR and a similar resting to desensitized conformational change in each membrane environment. In contrast, difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into egg phosphatidylcholine membranes lacking neutral and/or anionic lipids all exhibit an essentially identical pattern of band intensity variations, which is similar to the pattern of variations observed in difference spectra recorded in the continuous presence of the desensitizing local anesthetic, dibucaine. The difference spectra suggest that the main effect of both neutral and anionic lipids in a reconstituted egg phosphatidylcholine membrane is to help stabilize the nAChR in a resting conformation. In the absence of neutral and/or anionic lipids, the nAChR is converted into an alternate conformation that appears to be analogous to the local anesthetic-induced desensitized state. Significantly, the proportion of receptors found in the resting versus the putative desensitized state appears to be dependent upon the final lipid composition of the reconstituted membrane. A lipid-dependent modulation of the equilibrium between a channel-active resting and channel-inactive desensitized state may account for the modulations of nAChR activity that are observed in different lipid membranes.

Only the inhibitory effects at higher quercetin concentrations were observed in skeletal muscle SR which lacks phospholamban and in cardiac SR treated to remove phospholamban regulation. Stimulation was additive with monoclonal antibody 1D11 (directed against phospholamban) at submaximal antibody concentrations; however, the maximal antibody and quercetin stimulation were identical. Quercetin increased the calcium sensitivity of the Ca2+ATPase like that observed with phosphorylation of phospholamban or treatment with monoclonal antibody 1D11. In addition, low concentrations of quercetin increased the steady-state formation of phosphoenzyme from ATP or Pi, but higher quercetin decreased phosphoenzyme levels. Quercetin, even under stimulatory conditions, was a competitive inhibitor of ATP, but appears to relieve the Ca2+ATPase from phospholamban inhibition, thereby, producing an activation. The subsequent inhibitory action of higher quercetin concentrations results from competition of quercetin with the nucleotide binding site of the Ca2+ATPase.

https://openalex.org/W2118205016,"Leukotriene A4 hydrolase catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of the proinflammatory compound leukotriene B4, a reaction which is accompanied by suicide inactivation of the enzyme by leukotriene A4. We have recently reported that Tyr-378 is a major structural determinant for suicide inactivation and that mutation of Tyr-378 into Phe or Gln protects leukotriene A4 hydrolase from this catalytic restriction (Mueller, M. J., Blomster, M., Opperman, U. C. T., Jörnvall, H., Samuelsson, B., and Haeggström, J. Z. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 5931-5935). In the present study, we show that both [Y378F]- and [Y378Q]leukotriene A4 hydrolase converts leukotriene A4 not only into leukotriene B4 but also into a second, previously unknown, product of the enzyme. From biophysical analyses and comparison with a synthetic standard, the structure of this product was determined to 5S,12R-dihydroxy-6,10-trans-8,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid, i.e. Δ6-trans-Δ8-cis-leukotriene B4. The relative formation of Δ6-trans-Δ8-cis-leukotriene B4 versus leukotriene B4 by [Y378F]- and [Y378Q]leukotriene A4 hydrolase, was 18% and 32%, respectively. For [Y378F]leukotriene A4 hydrolase, the turnover of leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4 or Δ6-trans-Δ8-cis-leukotriene B4 was calculated to 2.5 s−1 which is almost three times the kcat value of the wild type enzyme. Taken together, these findings indicate that Tyr-378 is located at the active site where it assists in the formation of the correct double-bond geometry in the product leukotriene B4."

Steady state phosphorylation stimulated by Na+ concentrations less than 20 mM or by imidazole were similar for RD and E779A enzymes, an indication that phosphorylation and Na+ occlusion were not altered by this mutation. With E779A enzyme, higher Na+ concentrations reduced the level of phosphoenzyme and stimulated Na-ATPase activity in the absence of K+. These effects were a consequence of Na+ increasing the rate of protein dephosphorylation. In voltage-clamped HeLa cells expressing E779A enzyme, a prominent electrogenic Na+-Na+ exchange was observed in the absence of extracellular K+. Thus, increased Na-ATPase activity and Na+-dependent dephosphorylation result from Na+ acting as a K+ congener with low affinity at extracellular binding sites. These data suggest that E779A does not directly participate in ion binding but does affect the connection between extracellular ion binding and intracellular enzyme dephosphorylation. In cells expressing control RD enzyme, Na,K-pump current was dependent on membrane potential and extracellular K+ concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2039420264,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a potent and specific mitogen for different types of epithelial cells, including keratinocytes of the skin. To gain insight into the mechanisms of KGF action in this tissue, we attempted to identify genes that are regulated by KGF in keratinocytes. Using the differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technology, a gene was identified which was strongly induced in these cells by treatment with KGF but not with serum growth factors or pro-inflammatory cytokines. This gene seems to be part of a multigene family as assessed by Southern blot analysis. Molecular cloning and sequencing of the full-length cDNA revealed a strong homology with the yeast CHL1 gene. The latter encodes a putative helicase, which is involved in correct chromosome transmission and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the CHL1 gene product and the protein encoded by the novel KGF-regulated gene were identical in size, indicating that we had cloned the human CHL1 homologue. This finding suggests a novel and specific role of KGF in correct chromosome segregation and/or cell cycle progression."

To identify the potential mechanism of this action, the influence of insulin on IL-6 signal transduction was determined. An insulin dose-dependent reduction in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene transcription, mRNA accumulation, protein concentration, and IL-6-inducible DNA binding activity was detected. A reduction in the IL-6-activated sis-inducible element binding of STAT3 was observed within 4 h of insulin treatment, whereas a maximal 3-4-fold lower STAT protein concentration was measured after 8-24 h of insulin treatment. Insulin mediated a similar magnitude reduction in the amount of mRNA encoding the IL-6 receptor α subunit and IL-6 binding activity. These effects of insulin appear to contribute to the strongly suppressed transcriptional induction of the IL-6-responsive acute phase plasma protein genes."

INTRODUCTIONGenetic adaptive responses to hypoxic stress occur in many biological systems. Several systems for controlling these responses have been described in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. They involve the sensing of oxygen tension and the signal-transduction pathway leading to an alteration of gene expression. In bacteria, the sensor-regulator systems FixL, Fnr, and ArcB/ArcA are converted into active forms by oxygen deprivation (1Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 232-236Google Scholar, 2Lin E.C.C. Iuchi S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 361-387Google Scholar, 3Guest J.R. J. Gen.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Google Scholar). The rhizobial oxygen sensor FixL is a hemoprotein kinase whose activity is blocked by oxygen binding to the heme (1Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 232-236Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a DNA-binding factor HIF-1 induced by hypoxia plays a central role in hypoxic gene activation, and there is some evidence that oxygen tension is sensed by a hemoprotein (6Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar and references therein).In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oxygen control of gene expression is mediated essentially by two factors, which are active or synthesized only under aerobic conditions, the activator Cyp1p (Hap1) and the repressor Rox1p (reviewed in 7Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Google Scholar, 8Pinkham J.L. Keng T. Winkelman G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 455Google Scholar). Heme is believed to serve as an effector molecule; its biosynthesis has an absolute requirement for oxygen (9Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 235Google Scholar), and heme-deprivation appears to mimic the effects of oxygen deficiency in most of the cases tested (7Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Google Scholar, 8Pinkham J.L. Keng T. Winkelman G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 455Google Scholar); but the mechanism by which heme is implicated is not yet clear. Rox1p is a protein with a high mobility group motif that bends DNA when binding to a specific hypoxic consensus sequence and requires the general repressor complex Ssn6p·Tup1p to repress transcription of the target genes (10Balasubramanian B. Lowry C.V. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6071-6078Google Scholar, 11Deckert J. Rodriguez Torres A.M. Simon J.T. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6109-6117Google Scholar). The expression of the ROX1 gene is oxygen/heme-dependent via a complex regulatory network that includes the transcriptional activator Cyp1p, whose activity is heme-dependent (12Keng T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2616-2623Google Scholar, 13Ushinsky S.C. Keng T. Genetics. 1994; 136: 819-831Google Scholar, 14Deckert J. Perini R. Balasubramanian B. Zitomer R.S.

The Rox1p concentration is therefore greatly reduced in the absence of oxygen or heme, and hypoxic gene expression is derepressed. The regulation by oxygen of the hypoxic genes studied so far in some detail, such as ANB1 (TIF51B) (isoform of translation initiation factor eIF-5A) (16Mehta K.D. Smith M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8670-8675Google Scholar, 17Lowry C.V. Cerdan M.E. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5921-5926Google Scholar), COX5b (isoform of cytochrome oxidase subunit Vb) (18Hodge M.R.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5510-5520Google Scholar), AAC3 (isoform of ADP/ATP translocator) (20Sabova L. Zeman I. Supek F. Kolarov J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 547-553Google Scholar), and ERG11 (lanosterol 14α-demethylase) (21Turi T.G. Loper J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2046-2056Google Scholar), is entirely accounted for by the repression by Rox1p in aerobiosis.The HEM13 gene encodes the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase that catalyzes the sixth step in the heme biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme uses only oxygen as an electron acceptor for the oxidative decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen (9Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 235Google Scholar). HEM13 is the only gene in the pathway that is closely regulated (8Pinkham J.L. Keng T. Winkelman G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 455Google Scholar, 9Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 235Google Scholar); its transcription is induced 40-50-fold under conditions of oxygen or heme deficiency (22Zagorec M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2506-2509Google Scholar, 23Zagorec M. Buhler J.-M. Treich I. Keng T. Guarente L. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9718-9724Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that coproporphyrinogen oxidase activity becomes rate-limiting for heme production when its substrate oxygen is limiting; the cells respond to oxygen limitation by increasing the amount of the enzyme (23Zagorec M. Buhler J.-M. Treich I. Keng T. Guarente L. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9718-9724Google Scholar). Hence, coproporphyrinogen oxidase may play a crucial role in linking heme synthesis to the oxygen/heme-dependent control of gene expression, and it is important to understand how the HEM13 gene is regulated. Cyp1p has been found to interfere with this regulation (24Verdiere J. Gaisne M. Labbe-Bois R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 300-306Google Scholar), mainly by its role on the synthesis of Rox1p that represses HEM13 under aerobic heme-sufficient conditions (12Keng T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2616-2623Google Scholar, 13Ushinsky S.C. Keng T. Genetics. 1994; 136: 819-831Google Scholar). But the repression of HEM13 by Rox1p is only partial, and a preliminary deletion-mutant analysis of the HEM13 promoter has revealed the presence of a region acting as an upstream activation sequence (UAS) 1The abbreviations used are: UASupstream activation sequenceEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaysPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s). that is required for full induction under oxygen/heme deprivation (15Amillet J.-M. Buisson N. Labbe-Bois R. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 503-511Google Scholar). Such a UAS that responds positively to the absence of oxygen/heme is a novel regulatory element for yeast genes regulated by oxygen/heme. The present study describes the cis- and trans-elements of this UAS by directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We have also identified the Rox1p-responsive sites and an oxygen/heme-regulated protein factor binding close to one of them.DISCUSSIONWe have defined the cis and trans components of the two major regulatory pathways that control the induction of HEM13 expression in response to oxygen/heme deficiency: a 6-7-fold aerobic repression exerted by Rox1p and a 3-4-fold activation mediated by a novel UAS element. The two mechanisms provide a 20-30-fold induction to HEM13, which is slightly less than that observed experimentally (40-50-fold). The additional 2-fold activation to reach full induction level might be mediated by Cyp1p under heme deprivation and by unknown factor(s) under anaerobiosis (15Amillet J.-M. Buisson N. Labbe-Bois R. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 503-511Google Scholar). But Cyp1p probably acts indirectly since it apparently does not bind HEM13 promoter probes, even when using protein extracts enriched in Cyp1p and under conditions optimized for detecting DNA·Cyp1p complexes (33Fytlovich S. Gervais M. Agrimonti C. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1209-1218Google Scholar) (data not shown).HEM13 UASThe HEM13 UAS is about 40-bp long and is composed of two subelements, a 16-17-bp sequence binding a protein factor A and a 5′-flanking 20-bp GC-rich region. Both subelements are required additively for basal level of transcription, but each element alone appears to be sufficient for almost normal control of transcription by oxygen/heme. The protein-DNA complex A likely represents functionally important interactions, since different mutations affect both in vitro binding and in vivo promoter activity in a similar manner; this implicates protein factor A as a transcriptional activator. The DNA sequence of the factor A-binding site contains two blocks of dyad symmetry, CGAGTCG and TC-N11(AT-rich)-GA, which could be recognition motifs for factor A (see bottom of Fig. 3). Our results tend to favor the second one, but more work is needed to determine this with certainty. The role of the GC-rich region is not clear. It could bind a factor that was not detected in vitro in our EMSA conditions (perhaps via the rotationally symmetric CGG triplets), and this factor might participate with factor A in the additive transcriptional effect observed. Or its intrinsic DNA structure could impose constraints on the neighboring factor A-binding site. Unusual structures have been described for d(CCGCGG) (35Malinina L. Urpi L. Salas X. Huynh-Dinh T. Subirana J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 484-493Google Scholar) and d(GGGCCC) (36Brukner I. Susic S. Dlakic M. Savic A. Pongor S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 26-32Google Scholar) sequences, which are both present within the GC-rich region. Sequence comparisons revealed no obvious similarity of HEM13 UAS to the binding sites for known transcription factors (34Svetlov V.V. Cooper T.G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1439-1484Google Scholar) and to sequences in the upstream regions of other oxygen-regulated genes (7Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Google Scholar), including the hypoxic SRP1 and TIP1 genes whose regulation is independent of Rox1p (37Donzeau M. Bourdineaud J.-P. Lauquin G.J.-M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 449-459Google Scholar).The way in which HEM13 UAS receives the signal generated by oxygen/heme deficiency and increases transcriptional activity in response to it is unknown at present. It is unlikely that factor A is responsible for the oxygen/heme deficiency activation switch, since no apparent differences were observed in the pattern of complex A by EMSA analysis of induced and noninduced extracts, and mutations abrogating complex A formation did not greatly impair the oxygen/heme control. However, factor A might interact with a sensor-regulator factor, which could also contact the GC-rich region or a protein binding to it, thus explaining why each of the HEM13 UAS subelement is sufficient for control. Isolation and analysis of factor A should help clarify the problem of HEM13 UAS function.Rox1p-responsive ElementsTwo sites, R1 and R3, mediate the repression by Rox1p under aerobic heme-sufficient conditions. A factor(s) B binds to the region immediately upstream of site R3, and its synthesis or DNA-binding activity is oxygen/heme-dependent and requires Rox1p/Tup1p functions. This tight regulation of complex B formation, which parallels HEM13 regulation by Rox1p, suggests that these DNA-protein interactions are functionally significant. An oxygen- and heme-dependent DNA-binding activity has recently been identified; it binds with low specificity to a region of the COX6 promoter previously shown to act as a repressor site in the absence of heme (38Wright R.M. Simpson S.L. Lanoil B.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 458-466Google Scholar, 39Trawick J.D. Kraut N. Simon F.R. Poyton R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2302-2314Google Scholar). Since this activity was only detected under high salt conditions (>125 mM NaCl, compared with 50 mM KCl for our EMSA conditions), it is unlikely to be factor B. Factor B is also unlikely to be the oxygen- and heme-dependent factor RC2 described earlier, which binds specifically to CYC1 UAS1 and competes with Cyp1p (40Arcangioli B. Lescure B. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2627-2633Google Scholar, 41Pfeifer K. Arcangioli B. Guarente L. Cell. 1987; 49: 9-18Google Scholar).Various levels of repression stringency have been reported for the Rox1p-responsive sites found in the ANB1, COX5b, and AAC3 genes (Fig. 8). It has been suggested that the poly(dT-dA) sequences present immediately upstream of the Rox1p-consensus elements are necessary for repressor function (17Lowry C.V. Cerdan M.E. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5921-5926Google Scholar, 20Sabova L. Zeman I. Supek F. Kolarov J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 547-553Google Scholar). These poly(dT-dA) tracts are very long in the ANB1 and AAC3 genes, shorter in COX5b, and very short and imperfect in HEM13 (Fig. 8). In the case of COX5b, a specific factor, Ixr1p(Ord1p), is also implicated in the aerobic repression (42Lambert J.R. Bilanchone V.W. Cumsky M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7345-7349Google Scholar). Ixr1p(Ord1p), a two high mobility group-box protein initially isolated as a protein that binds to and bends platinated DNA (43Chow C.S. Whitehead J.P. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15124-15130Google Scholar), recognizes a 44-bp COX5b DNA segment encompassing the Rox1p element, probably in a structure-specific rather than a sequence-specific manner (42Lambert J.R. Bilanchone V.W. Cumsky M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7345-7349Google Scholar). Poly(dT-dA) sequences, by virtue of their intrinsic structure, can alter chromatin structure so that transcription factors gain better access to their cognate binding sites located in the vicinity (44Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Google Scholar). In the absence of long poly(dT-dA) sequences, other factors could be required that provide similar functions. The function of factor B (and Ixr1p?) may be to help Rox1p bind to its recognition sequence and anchor the general repressor complex Ssn6p·Tup1p with the proper protein-protein interactions to ensure its repressor activity. INTRODUCTIONGenetic adaptive responses to hypoxic stress occur in many biological systems. Several systems for controlling these responses have been described in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. They involve the sensing of oxygen tension and the signal-transduction pathway leading to an alteration of gene expression. In bacteria, the sensor-regulator systems FixL, Fnr, and ArcB/ArcA are converted into active forms by oxygen deprivation (1Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 232-236Google Scholar, 2Lin E.C.C. Iuchi S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 361-387Google Scholar, 3Guest J.R. J. Gen.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Google Scholar). The rhizobial oxygen sensor FixL is a hemoprotein kinase whose activity is blocked by oxygen binding to the heme (1Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 232-236Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a DNA-binding factor HIF-1 induced by hypoxia plays a central role in hypoxic gene activation, and there is some evidence that oxygen tension is sensed by a hemoprotein (6Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar and references therein).In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oxygen control of gene expression is mediated essentially by two factors, which are active or synthesized only under aerobic conditions, the activator Cyp1p (Hap1) and the repressor Rox1p (reviewed in 7Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Google Scholar, 8Pinkham J.L. Keng T. Winkelman G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 455Google Scholar). Heme is believed to serve as an effector molecule; its biosynthesis has an absolute requirement for oxygen (9Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 235Google Scholar), and heme-deprivation appears to mimic the effects of oxygen deficiency in most of the cases tested (7Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Google Scholar, 8Pinkham J.L. Keng T. Winkelman G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 455Google Scholar); but the mechanism by which heme is implicated is not yet clear. Rox1p is a protein with a high mobility group motif that bends DNA when binding to a specific hypoxic consensus sequence and requires the general repressor complex Ssn6p·Tup1p to repress transcription of the target genes (10Balasubramanian B. Lowry C.V. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6071-6078Google Scholar, 11Deckert J. Rodriguez Torres A.M. Simon J.T. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6109-6117Google Scholar). The expression of the ROX1 gene is oxygen/heme-dependent via a complex regulatory network that includes the transcriptional activator Cyp1p, whose activity is heme-dependent (12Keng T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2616-2623Google Scholar, 13Ushinsky S.C. Keng T. Genetics. 1994; 136: 819-831Google Scholar, 14Deckert J. Perini R. Balasubramanian B. Zitomer R.S.

The Rox1p concentration is therefore greatly reduced in the absence of oxygen or heme, and hypoxic gene expression is derepressed. The regulation by oxygen of the hypoxic genes studied so far in some detail, such as ANB1 (TIF51B) (isoform of translation initiation factor eIF-5A) (16Mehta K.D. Smith M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8670-8675Google Scholar, 17Lowry C.V. Cerdan M.E. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5921-5926Google Scholar), COX5b (isoform of cytochrome oxidase subunit Vb) (18Hodge M.R. Kim G. Singh K. Cumsky M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1958-1964Google Scholar, 19Hodge M.R. Singh K. Cumsky M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5510-5520Google Scholar), AAC3 (isoform of ADP/ATP translocator) (20Sabova L. Zeman I. Supek F. Kolarov J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 547-553Google Scholar), and ERG11 (lanosterol 14α-demethylase) (21Turi T.G. Loper J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2046-2056Google Scholar), is entirely accounted for by the repression by Rox1p in aerobiosis.The HEM13 gene encodes the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase that catalyzes the sixth step in the heme biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme uses only oxygen as an electron acceptor for the oxidative decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen (9Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 235Google Scholar). HEM13 is the only gene in the pathway that is closely regulated (8Pinkham J.L. Keng T. Winkelman G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 455Google Scholar, 9Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 235Google Scholar); its transcription is induced 40-50-fold under conditions of oxygen or heme deficiency (22Zagorec M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2506-2509Google Scholar, 23Zagorec M. Buhler J.-M. Treich I. Keng T. Guarente L. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9718-9724Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that coproporphyrinogen oxidase activity becomes rate-limiting for heme production when its substrate oxygen is limiting; the cells respond to oxygen limitation by increasing the amount of the enzyme (23Zagorec M. Buhler J.-M. Treich I. Keng T. Guarente L. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9718-9724Google Scholar). Hence, coproporphyrinogen oxidase may play a crucial role in linking heme synthesis to the oxygen/heme-dependent control of gene expression, and it is important to understand how the HEM13 gene is regulated. Cyp1p has been found to interfere with this regulation (24Verdiere J. Gaisne M. Labbe-Bois R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 300-306Google Scholar), mainly by its role on the synthesis of Rox1p that represses HEM13 under aerobic heme-sufficient conditions (12Keng T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2616-2623Google Scholar, 13Ushinsky S.C. Keng T. Genetics. 1994; 136: 819-831Google Scholar). But the repression of HEM13 by Rox1p is only partial, and a preliminary deletion-mutant analysis of the HEM13 promoter has revealed the presence of a region acting as an upstream activation sequence (UAS) 1The abbreviations used are: UASupstream activation sequenceEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaysPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s). that is required for full induction under oxygen/heme deprivation (15Amillet J.-M. Buisson N. Labbe-Bois R. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 503-511Google Scholar). Such a UAS that responds positively to the absence of oxygen/heme is a novel regulatory element for yeast genes regulated by oxygen/heme. The present study describes the cis- and trans-elements of this UAS by directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We have also identified the Rox1p-responsive sites and an oxygen/heme-regulated protein factor binding close to one of them.

They involve the sensing of oxygen tension and the signal-transduction pathway leading to an alteration of gene expression.

We have reported that smooth muscle cells derived from the intima of atherosclerotic lesions express the proto-oncogene c-fms and a scavenger receptor, which are not normally expressed in normal medial smooth muscle cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) induced the expression of c-fms and the scavenger receptor in normal human medial smooth muscle cells to the level observed in the intima. The expression of c-fms was partially inhibited by a protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting that HB-EGF induces c-fms via pathways that are both dependent on and independent of protein kinase C. By contrast, most of the scavenger receptor induction by HB-EGF was suppressed by protein kinase C inhibitors. These results indicate that two characteristic genes of monocyte-derived macrophages were induced by HB-EGF via different mechanisms. The alteration of gene expression in response to HB-EGF may play an important role in the phenotypic change of smooth muscle cells to macrophage-like foam cells during the atherosclerotic process.

It has been suggested that HB-EGF binds to the EGF receptor through an interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the cell surface (7Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrum M. J.

Foam cell formation is the most characteristic event of early atherosclerosis. Foam cells are derived from both monocyte-derived macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Peripheral monocytes enter the subendothelial space and differentiate to tissue macrophages that actively take up lipoprotein cholesterol through receptor-mediated endocytosis, including the scavenger receptor (8Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Google Scholar, 9Thyberg J. Hedin U. Sjolund M. Palmberg L. Bottger B.A. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 966-990Google Scholar, 10Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Google Scholar). Smooth muscle cells migrate from the media to the intima of the arterial wall, where they proliferate and transform into foam cells. Various cytokines and growth factors secreted by vascular cell components are presumed to play important roles in the phenotypic change of monocyte-derived macrophages and smooth muscle cells (10Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of phenotypic change in cells (especially smooth muscle cells) in atherosclerotic lesions is not fully understood. As a characteristic change of gene expression between two phenotypes of vascular smooth muscle cells derived from the intima and media, we demonstrated the expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor encoded by proto-oncogene c-fms on smooth muscle cells derived from the intima of atherosclerotic lesions (11Inaba T. Yamada N. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Shimada M. Momomura K. Kadowaki T. Motoyoshi K. Tsukada T. Morisaki N. Saito Y. Yoshida S. Takaku F. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5693-5699Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have reported that PDGF-BB homodimer transiently induces gene expression of c-fms in normal vascular smooth muscle cells (12Inaba T. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Shimada M. Harada K. Kozaki K. Watanabe Y. Hoh E. Motoyoshi K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Biol.

Ishibashi S. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1133-1139Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that the factors involved in the atherosclerotic process cause changes in the regulation of c-fms gene expression in normal vascular smooth muscle cells by inducing phenotypic change to macrophage-like cells. In the present study, we found that HB-EGF independently raises the stable expression of c-fms in normal vascular smooth muscle cells to that in intimal smooth muscle cells. Human aortic medial smooth muscle cells were explanted by the method described by Fischer-Dzoga et al. (14Fischer-Dzoga K. Jones R.M. Vesselinovitch D. Wissler R.W. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1973; 18: 162-176Google Scholar). Cells were passaged three times by exposure to trypsin and seeded in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc) containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 100-mm dishes; Cells from the fourth to sixth passages were used for experiments. Subconfluent cells were cultured with serum-free medium for 24 h before the experiments, and medial smooth muscle cells were cultured with DMEM containing 1% FCS in the presence of HB-EGF at 37°C. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). HB-EGF was donated by Dr. Judith A. Abraham (Scios Nova Inc., Mountain View, CA). Human smooth muscle cells were treated with HB-EGF for various periods (1-48 h) or with various concentrations (1-5 ng/ml) of HB-EGF for 8 h in DMEM containing 1% FCS after incubation with serum-free medium for 24 h. After incubation with HB-EGF, total RNA was isolated using the acid-guanidine phenol-chloroform method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). A competitive polymerase chain reaction method was used to measure M-CSF receptor (c-fms) mRNA levels as described previously (11Inaba T. Yamada N. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Shimada M. Momomura K.

A 1.2-kilobase PstI fragment (fragment 2048-3194) of the human c-fms cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(−) (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA), and this plasmid was digested with BglII. In the case of the scavenger receptor, a 290-base pair cDNA fragment was prepared for cloning the polymerase chain reaction product with primers human scavenger receptor 1 (5′-TCGCTCAATGACAGCTTTGC-3′) and human scavenger receptor 2 (5′-CCATGTTGCTCATGTGTTCC-3′) into EcoRV-digested pBluescript II, and this plasmid was linearized by digesting with XbaI. The linearized DNA was transcribed and labeled with [α-32P]UTP (specific activity, 800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) using a Riboprobe Gemini system according to the method described in the instructions (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). A resultant 354-base pair antisense RNA probe for c-fms and a 324-base pair antisense RNA probe for the scavenger receptor were used for the ribonuclease protection assay as described in the instructions (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Total RNA (25 μg) was hybridized with approximately 20,000 cpm of the RNA probe overnight at 42°C, and the mixture was digested with RNase A and RNase T1. Protected fragments were separated on 5% acrylamide/8 M urea gels. We performed the run-on assay according to the method described previously (16Inaba T. Kawamura M. Gotoda T. Harada K. Shimada M. Ohsuga J. Shimano H. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 522-528Google Scholar). Five μg of plasmids containing either human c-fms DNA or human β-actin cDNA were linearized, and the linearized plasmids were blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane. The membrane was hybridized with α-32P labeled nuclear RNAs (107 cpm) isolated from nuclear transcription and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80°C. Subconfluent cells were solubilized in 50 mM Tris-malate buffer containing 3% SDS, 8 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at pH 6.0 after incubation for 24 h with fresh medium containing 5 ng/ml HB-EGF. The cell lysates containing 150 μg of protein were subjected to 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Proteins electrophoresed were transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and the paper was incubated with anti-c-fms monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Science Inc., New York, NY). After the nitrocellulose sheet was incubated with 125I-protein A (2,000 cpm/ng, 0.5 μg/ml; Amersham), autoradiography was performed. Gels were calibrated based on the following molecular mass standards: 200 kDa for myosin, 116 kDa for β-galactosidase, 94 kDa for phosphorylase b, 68 kDa for bovine serum albumin, and 43 kDa for ovalbumin. Vascular medial smooth muscle cells were cultured with 5 ng/ml HB-EGF in the presence or absence of 50 nM staurosporine and 10 nM calphostin C (protein kinase C inhibitors) and in the presence of 100 μg/ml acetylated LDL for 24 h to study the accumulation of cholesterol ester. LDL was isolated from healthy subjects, and acetylated LDL was prepared as described previously (17Ishibashi S. Inaba T. Shimano H. Harada K. Inoue I. Mokuno H. Mori N. Gotoda T. Takaku F. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14109-14117Google Scholar). The cellular cholesterol ester content was measured using a fluorescence-enzymatic method as described previously (17Ishibashi S. Inaba T. Shimano H. Harada K. Inoue I. Mokuno H. Mori N. Gotoda T. Takaku F. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14109-14117Google Scholar). The nonspecific cellular cholesterol ester content was determined in the absence of acetylated LDL. The mRNA of c-fms was not detected in human aortic smooth muscle cells using a RNase protection assay with a riboprobe of c-fms. In the presence of 5 ng/ml HB-EGF, mRNA of c-fms was obviously detected in human smooth muscle cells both in the presence and absence of 1% FCS, whereas it was not detected in the presence of 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB (Fig. 1, A and B). This expression was less than that of human monocyte-derived macrophages. To estimate the mRNA level of c-fms, we used a sensitive competitive polymerase chain reaction method. In assays of human aortic smooth muscle cells in the presence of 5 ng/ml HB-EGF, the mRNA levels were estimated at 7 × 10−2 pg/μl genomic DNA. This indicates that the transcription of c-fms in human aortic smooth muscle cells was increased 3,500-fold in response to 5 ng/ml HB-EGF compared with basal conditions (the absence of HB-EGF). We have previously reported that in human aortic smooth muscle cells in the presence of 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB homodimer, the mRNA levels were estimated at 0.8 × 10−2 pg/μl genomic DNA, indicating that the transcription of c-fms was increased 8.75-fold by 5 ng/ml HB-EGF compared with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB homodimer (Fig. 1B). In a nuclear run-on assay, 5 ng/ml HB-EGF increased the transcriptional rate of c-fms approximately 10-fold compared with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. The induced mRNA level was comparable with that of human monocyte-derived macrophages and rabbit intimal smooth muscle cells (7 × 10−2 versus 17.5 × 10−2 and 10 × 10−2 pg/μl, respectively; Table I). As we reported, the transcription of c-fms in human aortic smooth muscle cells was increased 10-fold in the presence of both PDGF-BB and EGF compared with PDGF-BB alone (13Inaba T. Gotoda T. Harada K. Shimada M. Ohsuga J. Ishibashi S. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin.

This enhanced expression of c-fms was sustained at least 48 h after exposure to HB-EGF. The effect of HB-EGF on the c-fms expression was dose dependent at concentrations of 0.5-3 ng/ml HB-EGF (Fig. 2B). The amounts of total RNA/cell were not significantly different between HB-EGF-treated and untreated cells. Staurosporine (50 nM) and calphostin C (10 nM), protein kinase C inhibitors, suppressed c-fms expression in the presence of HB-EGF to 40-50% of that in controls (Table I and Fig. 3).Fig. 3Ribonuclease protection assay of M-CSF receptor mRNAs isolated from human aortic medial smooth muscle cells. Human aortic medial smooth muscle cells were explanted from the human aorta. Subconfluent cells were cultured with 5 ng/ml human HB-EGF in the presence or absence of protein kinase C inhibitors (50 nM staurosporine and 10 nM calphostin C) in DMEM containing 1% FCS for 8 h after a 24-h preincubation in serum-free medium. Thereafter, 25 μg of total RNA were applied to a ribonuclease protection assay with the RNA probe for human c-fms. The protection assay was performed twice, and the representative result is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of M-CSF receptor was demonstrated in human medial smooth muscle cells treated with 3 ng/ml HB-EGF for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4, a 165-kDa protein of M-CSF receptor was detected in human medial smooth muscle cells treated with HB-EGF as well as in human monocyte-derived macrophages, whereas no specific band for c-fms was detected in nontreated medial smooth muscle cells. Using the method of RNase protection assay with a riboprobe of human scavenger receptor, we detected mRNA of the scavenger receptor. HB-EGF induced mRNA of the scavenger receptor in human medial smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Staurosporine (50 nM) and calphostin C (10 nM) completely inhibited the expression of scavenger receptor mRNA in the presence of 5 ng/ml HB-EGF (Fig. 5B). To confirm these findings, we estimated the accumulation of cellular cholesterol ester in human medial smooth muscle cells incubated with 100 μg/ml acetylated LDL. As shown in Fig. 6, cholesterol ester accumulated in vascular smooth muscle cells in response to HB-EGF in the presence of acetylated LDL (Fig. 6). The accumulation of cholesterol ester in response to HB-EGF was inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine (50 nM) and calphostin C (10 nM). Numerous cytokines and growth factors are secreted by vascular cell components, including endothelial cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and lymphocytes, and are involved in atherosclerotic processes such as transformation, migration, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, monocyte differentiation, and foam cell formation (9Thyberg J. Hedin U. Sjolund M. Palmberg L. Bottger B.A. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 966-990Google Scholar, 10Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Google Scholar). We have focused on the mechanisms for the phenotypic change from vascular smooth muscle cells to phagocytic cells that is characterized by expression of the scavenger receptor gene and M-CSF receptor encoded by c-fms, which generally coincides with monocyte-derived macrophage lineages. Among growth factors, we previously demonstrated that a combination of PDGF-BB homodimer and either EGF or FGF induced c-fms expression in vascular medial smooth muscle cells, which do not normally express this gene, to the level equivalent to that of rabbit intimal smooth muscle cells isolated from atherosclerotic lesions (11Inaba T. Yamada N. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Shimada M. Momomura K. Kadowaki T. Motoyoshi K. Tsukada T. Morisaki N. Saito Y. Yoshida S. Takaku F. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5693-5699Google Scholar). However, neither EGF nor FGF alone induces c-fms expression, and PDGF-BB alone induces only transient and low expression. The present study demonstrated that HB-EGF independently induced the stable expression of c-fms in medial smooth muscle cells to the expression level of intimal smooth muscle cells. We have reported that the c-fms expression by PDGF-BB alone is not mediated through protein kinase C activation and then augmented by EGF and FGF through certain pathways, including protein kinase C activation. PDGF-BB initially renders cells competent to respond to progression factors (18Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4481-4485Google Scholar, 19Lee L. Weinstein I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5168-5172Google Scholar), and the progression factors such as EGF and FGF stimulate the signal induced by PDGF-BB. The potency of HB-EGF in c-fms expression is approximately 10-fold greater than that of PDGF-BB and rather close to that of combinations of PDGF-BB and either EGF or FGF with regard to both magnitude and stability of c-fms expression (13Inaba T. Gotoda T. Harada K. Shimada M. Ohsuga J. Ishibashi S. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1133-1139Google Scholar). It has been suggested that HB-EGF has functions of both competent and progression factors in cell growth (1Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J.C. Klagsbrum M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Google Scholar, 7Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrum M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 933-940Google Scholar). HB-EGF may switch on high and stable c-fms expression by consecutively stimulating the signals of both protein kinase C-dependent and -independent pathways. Treatment of aortic smooth muscle cells with staurosporine and calphostin C, which are protein kinase C inhibitors, suppressed c-fms expression in the presence of HB-EGF to 40-50% of that in the absence of protein kinase C inhibitors. This result indicates that the effect of HB-EGF cannot be attributed to protein kinase C activation only; therefore, HB-EGF induces c-fms expression through other pathways as well. The induction of c-fms expression by different growth factors in normal medial smooth muscle cells may serve as a good model for studying complex signaling cascades initiated by growth factors and cytokines in the arterial wall. Recently, we demonstrated gene expression of the scavenger receptor as well as c-fms in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from atherosclerotic lesions (11Inaba T. Yamada N. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Shimada M. Momomura K. Kadowaki T. Motoyoshi K. Tsukada T. Morisaki N. Saito Y. Yoshida S. Takaku F. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5693-5699Google Scholar). We proposed that this gene expression may be related to the phenotypic conversion of vascular smooth muscle cells to macrophage-like cells in atheromatous lesions. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that some cytokines and growth factors, including the PDGF-BB homodimer and EGF, induce scavenger receptor expression in normal vascular smooth muscle cells through protein kinase C activation (13Inaba T. Gotoda T. Harada K. Shimada M. Ohsuga J. Ishibashi S. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1133-1139Google Scholar, 20Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12722-12727Google Scholar, 21Bickel P.E. Freeman M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1450-1457Google Scholar). Likewise, the present study demonstrated that HB-EGF induced the scavenger receptor expression through protein kinase C activation. Most of the scavenger receptor expression in terms of both mRNA expression and acetylated LDL uptake was suppressed by protein kinase C inhibitors. This result confirms previous reports that the scavenger receptor expression in vascular smooth muscle cells is induced by protein kinase C activation. It has been speculated that the heparin binding property of HB-EGF may play an important role in the marked enhancement of cell migration and proliferation compared with EGF, which shares the EGF receptor with HB-EGF (1Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J.C. Klagsbrum M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Google Scholar, 7Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrum M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 933-940Google Scholar). In fact, we demonstrated that HB-EGF is the most potent growth factor for c-fms expression. A recent report has suggested the possible involvement of HB-EGF in the atherosclerotic process from the evidence of its high expression in atherosclerotic lesions and demonstrated the strong expression of the EGF receptor in intimal smooth muscle cells compared with the extremely low level of EGF receptor expression in medial smooth muscle cells (6Miyagawa J. Higashiyama S. Kawata S. Inui S. Tamura S. Yamamoto K. Nishida M. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 404-411Google Scholar). These results suggest that HB-EGF mainly influences functions of smooth muscle cells through the interaction with the EGF receptor in the intima, changing the phenotype to macrophage-like cells by expressing both c-fms and the scavenger receptor. The strong potency of HB-EGF in the regulation of cellular functions, including induction of c-fms and the scavenger receptor, cell migration, and proliferation, suggests its significant involvement in the atherosclerotic process. Although further studies are required to clarify the precise mechanisms of regulation, modifying the expression of HB-EGF as well as PDGF will be a major target for the prevention of the progression of atherosclerosis."

All members of the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors share a 300-amino acid region of homology in their N termini, referred to as the Rel homology domain. The activity of NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors is controlled at multiple levels due, in part, to the complexity of the individual NF-κB molecules. One level of regulation is through the association of IκB with NF-κB/Rel proteins (9Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Google Scholar, 10Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Google Scholar). Another level of regulation is provided by the different combination of NF-κB/Rel dimers formed and the κB sites recognized or activated by them (5Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Biophys.

For example, the p50 homodimer binds different κB sites such as Ig-κB, H2-κB, and IFN-β-κB with equally high affinity but only activates expression from H2-κB and Ig/HIV κB sites (12Fujita T.

The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) is a member of a class of cellular genes referred to as tumor suppressor genes, anti-oncogenes, or recessive oncogenes (17Weinberg R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3713-3721Google Scholar). These proteins are associated with a subset of human cancers, including retinoblastoma, small cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and carcinoma of the bladder and breast, which are due to the frequent loss or mutational inactivation of the Rb gene (18Lee E.Y.-H.P. To H. Shew J.-Y. Bookstein R. Scully P. Lee W.-H. Science. 1988; 241: 218-221Google Scholar, 19Kaye F.J. Kratzke R.A. Gerster J.L. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6922-6926Google Scholar). Rb is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein, the phosphorylation state of which changes during the cell cycle, with a role in regulating cellular proliferation and gene expression (20Ludlow J.W. Shon J. Pipas J.M. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 387-396Google Scholar, 21Mittnacht S. Weinberg R. Cell. 1991; 65: 381-393Google Scholar, 22DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Lynch D.

Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 391-407Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rb at the G1-S transition allows the progression of cells into S phase and through the cell cycle. Sequences in the Rb protein, commonly referred to as the pocket (approximately 400 amino acids), are important for protein-protein interactions (24Hu Q. Dyson N. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1147-1155Google Scholar, 25Ewen M. Faha B. Harlow E. Livingston D.M. Science. 1992; 255: 85-87Google Scholar, 26Qin X. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Google Scholar) and contain homology with basal transcription factors TBP and TFIIB (27Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Google Scholar). Rb interacts with, and negatively regulates, the cellular transcription factor E2F (28Shirodkar S. Ewen M. DeCaprio J.A. Morgan J. Livingston D.M. Chittenden T. Cell. 1992; 68: 157-166Google Scholar, 29Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Google Scholar). Transient cotransfection experiments have demonstrated that an Rb expression plasmid inhibits E2F-dependent transcription, which is correlated with the ability of Rb to interact with E2F (30Weintraub S.J. Prater C. Dean D. Nature. 1992; 358: 259-261Google Scholar, 31Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N.B. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. Dean S.H.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Google Scholar). Rb is physically associated with the E2F DNA-protein complex. It has been proposed that Rb binds to the E2F activation domain and blocks its function as a transcription factor. Independent studies have further suggested that Rb-E2F is an active repressive complex, which inhibits activation of other promoter elements when bound to the E2F sites (28Shirodkar S. Ewen M. DeCaprio J.A. Morgan J. Livingston D.M. Chittenden T. Cell. 1992; 68: 157-166Google Scholar). Constructs containing E2F sites cloned into a promoter with a TATA box and an ATF transcription factor site were tested for activation by ATF in the presence of E2F-Rb. The presence of E2F sites inhibited activation of this promoter regardless of the presence of ATF. This attributes a critical function to Rb since it is described as a regulator that affects promoter activity by switching a E2F site from positive to negative elements. The interaction of E2F and Rb is restricted to the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle since only underphosphorylated Rb forms complex with E2F. Subsequent phosphorylation of Rb disrupts the Rb-E2F interactions, allowing progression into S phase. Activation of E2F stimulates transcription of S-phase progression genes such as the E2F family, dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, thymidine synthase, ribonucleotide reductase, and c-myb. The interaction of Rb with other transcription factors such as elf-1 (32Wang C.Y. Petryniak B. Thompson C.B. Kaelin W.G. Leiden J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1330-1335Google Scholar), PU.1 (27Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Google Scholar), c-myc (33Hateboer G. Timmers H.T.M. Rustgi A.K. Billaud M. van't Veer L.J. Bernards R. Proc.

Interestingly, interaction of Rb with elf-1 suppresses transcription similar to that seen with Rb and E2F. The functional consequence of the interaction of Rb with c-myc or PU.1 remains to be determined but appears to be distinct from that seen with E2F since Rb does not directly inhibit PU.1 or c-myc transcriptional activity in the absence of a binding site for E2F (32Wang C.Y. Petryniak B. Thompson C.B. Kaelin W.G. Leiden J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1330-1335Google Scholar).

The LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and AdML plasmids used for the in vitro transcription assays have been described previously (23Bohan C.A. Kashanchi F. Ensoli B. Buonaguro L. Boris-Lawrie K.A. Brady J.N. Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 391-407Google Scholar). GST RB fusion or GST proteins were generated in Escherichia coli by growth of the transformed HB101 strain in Luria broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were grown to an absorbance of 0.6, followed by induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The GST fusion proteins were obtained by sonication of the bacterial pellet in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4°C for 30 min. The extract was purified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4°C. The GST proteins were eluted by the addition of 20 mM glutathione, pH 7.5, for 10 min, followed by an overnight dialysis in buffer D (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 M KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The purified preparations were analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The concentrations of the 27-kDa GST, 71-kDa GST RB (379-792), and 86-kDa GST RB (379-928) were estimated by comparing the intensities of the bands with those of a known bovine serum albumin standard. One unit is defined as 100 ng of protein. [35S]Methionine-labeled NF-κB p65, p50, and c-Rel were in vitro transcribed and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using the TNT system (Promega Corp.). Protein production and yield was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. NF-κB p50 protein, purified from E. coli, was obtained from Promega. The concentration of this protein is given as gel shift units (gsu), 3.2 gsu/μl or 69 ng/gsu. Templates were prepared by digestion of 100 μg of plasmid DNA with 5-10-fold units excess of restriction enzymes for up to 2 h under buffer conditions recommended by New England BioLabs. After the termination of the digest, the DNA was subjected to two phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (50:50:1) extractions and a subsequent ethanol precipitation. All incubations were done at 30°C. The in vitro transcription buffer contained 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM dithiothreitol, 6.25 mM MgCl2, and 8.5% glycerol. Two to ten μg/ml of the HIV-1 LTR chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and AdML DNAs were linearized by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI, respectively. One hundred twenty-five to 500 ng of template were used per reaction. HeLa whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (35Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Google Scholar) and added to a final concentration of approximately 3.75 mg/ml (~55 ng/reaction). The reactions also contained nucleoside triphosphates in water (500 μM), [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol) (15 μCi), purified GST fusion protein (1.0 unit), and purified p50 (Promega) at various concentrations. Transcription reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.2% SDS. 32P-Labeled RNA was purified and analyzed on a 4% polyacrylamide-urea gel under denaturing conditions as described previously. Jurkat cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 1 h. Whole-cell extracts were prepared, and immunoprecipitations were performed as follows. Cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 400-600 μl of lysis buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Aprotinin and leupeptin were added fresh at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. After 40 min of incubation, the cells were vortexed briefly, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was retained for immunoprecipitation. Three hundred μg of whole-cell extract was used in each assay. The immunoprecipitation was performed using equivalent amounts of anti-Rb, anti-p50, or rabbit antisera. After 3 h of incubation at 4°C, the antibodies were precipitated using protein A-protein G beads (previously blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 4°C. Beads and the complexes bound to them were washed two times with the lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated on a 4-20% Tris-glycine gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter, and immunoblotted with anti-Rb antibodies. After 30 min in blocking buffer, as described above, the blot was incubated with the Rb antibodies (1:500 dilution; Pharmingen) for 30 min at room temperature, then washed three times in blocking buffer. Peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibodies (1:10000; Amersham Corp.) was added to the primary antibodies. The blot was incubated with the secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature, washed five times with 1 × TNE (100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM EDTA), and treated with Amersham ECL Western blotting reagents. The image was developed using Amersham ECL Western blotting reagent and exposed to Kodak XAR autoradiography film. The murine Igκ-enhancer NF-κB oligonucleotide 5′-GATCCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAG-3′ and the TNF-β sequence 5′-GATCCAGAGGGGCTTCCCCGAGAG-3′ were Klenow-labeled with [32P]dGTP (Amersham). The labeled oligonucleotides were desalted with G-25 spin columns (Boehringer Mannheim) and precipitated in ethanol. The probe was resuspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mM EDTA. The gel shift reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl in gel shift reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) with purified NF-κB p50 (Promega), GST fusion purified protein, 0.5-2 ng (~50,000 cpm) of labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide, and 3 μg poly(dI·dC/dI·dC) (Pharmacia) at room temperature for 20 min. The gel shift complexes were analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (39Lindholm P.F. Reid R.L. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1294-1302Google Scholar). Competition reactions were incubated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled mutant or wild-type Igκ NF-κB oligonucleotide to identify a specific NF-κB gel shift complex. The specificity of the NF-κB gel shift complex was also demonstrated by adding 3 μl of anti-p50 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) to the p50 gel shift reactions, producing a supershift complex. For GST binding assays, the [35S]methionine-labeled NF-κB proteins were incubated with approximately 0.5 μg of either GST or GST Rb proteins in buffer D with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol for 2 h at 4°C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (100 μl of 50% suspension) were added for an additional 2 h at 4°C with gentle mixing. The reactions were washed three times with the same buffer, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. E. coli-purified GST Rb pocket (amino acids 379-792) fusion protein was tested for its ability to regulate the DNA binding activity of NF-κB p50. Approximately 100 ng of purified p50 was incubated with the Igκ NF-κB oligonucleotide probe. The specificity of the p50 homodimer complex was demonstrated by gel shift competition assay (Fig. 1A, lanes 1′, 2′, and 3′). The p50 gel shift complex was competed by the specific wild-type competitor but not the mutant competitor. Furthermore, the gel shift complex was supershifted with anti-p50 but not a control antibody (data not shown). The concentration of p50 used in the Rb induction assay was titrated to a level where a gel shift complex was minimal (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Increasing concentrations of GST and GST Rb were added to the p50 gel shift reactions. As the concentration of GST Rb increased, the gel shift activity of p50 increased until a saturation level was reached (Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 12). In lane 7, the protein concentration of Rb and NF-κB is approximately equivalent. In control reactions with GST, the gel shift activity of p50 was not affected. The results presented in Fig. 1B further demonstrate that the p50 induction was due to the Rb domain of the GST-Rb fusion protein. An equal concentration of GST-p53 or bovine serum albumin control proteins did not induce p50 binding (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). Several lines of evidence argue against the p50 induction being due to the oxidation-reduction potential of glutathione. (a) The control GST protein went through the same glutathione elution and dialysis, and no induction of p50 binding was observed with this protein. (b) Direct addition of glutathione at concentrations equivalent to the dialyzed protein failed to induce p50 binding (data not shown). 792) Inhibits the p50-induced Transcription of HIV-1 LTR—In vitro transcription assays with a NFκB-inducible template were performed to investigate the functional significance of Rb on p50 transcription activity. The HIV-1 promoter contains two copies of the nonpalindromic Igκ NF-κB binding site upstream of the transcription initiation site (−80 to −107). The linearized HIV-1 LTR template produces a run-off transcript of 325 bases, which was sensitive to the addition of α-amanitin (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Purified NF-κB p50 activated HIV transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 3-7). The origin of the higher molecular weight RNA observed at the higher NF-κB concentrations is not known. Transcription activity is quantitatively shown in Fig. 2B as a bell-shaped induction curve. In the presence of added p50, a range of 1-8.7-fold induction of basal transcription was observed. Specificity of NF-κB p50 activation of HIV-1 LTR transcription was demonstrated by the addition of p50 antibody to the transcription reaction. Antibodies were added to the transcription reaction, where the highest induction of p50-activated transcription was observed. Upon the addition of anti-p50 antibody, but not the control IgG, the p50-activated transcription was inhibited, and only basal levels of transcription were detected (Fig. 2C). These results show that the activated transcription of HIV is due to p50. The effect of Rb (379-792) on the p50-induced transcription was analyzed (Fig. 2D). Control reactions with HIV-1 LTR and GST or GST Rb were included as controls (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2). The addition of p50 to the control reactions with GST produced a bell-shaped induction curve (Fig. 2D, lanes 3-7). The difference in p50 titration curves seen in Fig. 2, A and D, are likely due to a difference in specific activity of the p50 used in the two experiments. When Rb (379-792) was included in the p50-induced transcription assay, a suppression of the p50-induced transcription activity was detected (Fig. 2D, lanes 8-12). These results are quantitatively demonstrated in Fig. 2E. To demonstrate that Rb does not nonspecifically repress transcription, GST Rb was added to transcription reactions with a control AdML template (Fig. 2F). Transcription from the AdML promoter was compared with reactions containing GST or GST Rb. No differences were observed in the transcription reactions of AdML alone or with GST or GST Rb (379-792) (Fig. 2F, lanes 1-3). One interpretation of the transcription experiments might be that since Rb induces p50 binding, the bell-shaped p50 induction curve is simply offset in the presence of Rb. We, therefore, compared the transcriptional activity of equivalent p50 DNA binding activities in the absence or presence of Rb (Fig. 2G). Gel shift assays were performed with in vitro transcription reaction buffer (Fig. 2G). Under those conditions, equivalent p50-DNA binding activity was observed at 14 ng of p50 in the presence of GST and 3 ng of p50 in the presence of GST Rb. At 56 ng of p50, equivalent p50 binding was observed in the presence of GST or GST Rb (Fig. 2G). By comparing the percentage of p50 bound to the κB site and the fold induction of transcriptional activity, we conclude that p50 is not able to activate transcription in the presence of Rb (Fig. 2G). The transcription analysis suggested that the Rb-induced NF-κB complex was transcriptionally inactive. Previous studies by Fujita et al. (12Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Google Scholar) have demonstrated that NF-κB p50 provides strong transcriptional activation only when adopting a chymotrypsin-resistant conformation. Therefore, we analyzed the conformation of p50 bound to the κB motif in the presence of Rb using a chymotrypsin sensitivity assay. Two sets of gel shift reactions were studied and compared; the first contained p50 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-5), and the second contained the Rb-induced p50 gel shift complex (Fig. 3A, lanes 8-12). The p50 gel shift complexes were subsequently treated with chymotrypsin for various times. The reactions were stopped upon the addition of chymostatin, and the complex containing the labeled κB motif was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Quantitative analysis of chymotrypsin digestion demonstrated that the control NF-κB and Rb-induced NF-κB complex were digested at different rates (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-5 and 7-11; Fig. 3B). For example, at the 10-min time point, the Rb-induced NF-κB gel shift complex was reduced by approximately 55%. In contrast, no significant reduction in the amount of control NF-κB complex was observed. The difference in chymotrypsin sensitivity is further evident if one compares the NF-κB gel shift complex intensity at 0 and 15 min. Although there is 5-10-fold more complex in the Rb-induced control incubation, the signal at 15 min of digestion is equivalent between the two samples (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 5, 7 and 11). The chymotrypsin-sensitive nature of the Rb-induced NF-κB complex correlates with decreased transcriptional activity. Rb induction of NF-κB binding activity might be mediated through direct protein-protein interaction. Therefore, coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed with Jurkat whole-cell extracts. The whole-cell extract was incubated with anti-p50, anti-Rb, or rabbit IgG. The proteins from these immunoprecipitations were separated on a 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-Rb antibody. Rb protein was detected in immunoprecipitation reactions that contained anti-Rb or anti-p50 antibodies (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). In the control reaction, Rb failed to coprecipitate with preimmune rabbit antisera (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Because the IgG heavy chain migrates at ~50 kDa, we were unable to perform the reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of p50 with Rb, i.e. precipitate the Rb protein and immunoblot with anti-p50. The interaction between Rb and p50 was also demonstrated with in vitro GST binding assays. Glutathione-Sepharose beads containing equal quantities of GST or GST Rb (379-792) proteins were incubated with in vitro translated p50. NF-κB p50 was specifically precipitated in the presence of GST Rb (Fig. 4B, lane 2) but not in the presence of control GST protein. Similar binding assays with other members of the NF-κB family, including p65 and c-rel, suggests that the Rb pocket interacts with the Rel homology domain (data not shown). The activity of the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors is regulated at multiple levels. In this study, we discovered a novel interaction between the cellular transcription factor NF-κB p50 and the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, Rb. This interaction is specific and can be found in both whole-cell extracts of constitutively expressing NF-κB cell lines and in vitro using GST binding assays with translated NF-κB proteins. Our experiments further demonstrate that Rb stimulates binding of the transcription factor NF-κB p50 to DNA. Interestingly, the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in the presence of Rb is decreased relative to the control NF-κB, suggesting that Rb regulates the transcriptional activity of p50 in addition to its DNA binding activity. Studies have shown that Rb binds to several transcription factors in vivo and in vitro and, as a result, regulates their function. Given the physical interaction between Rb and p50 and the function of Rb in repression of E2F activity, one interpretation of these results might be that Rb is a part of the NF-κB/DNA complex, blocking the interaction of NF-κB with the basal transcription machinery. Using antibody supershift and biotinylated DNA pull-down assays, we have been unable to demonstrate that Rb is a stable component of the DNA-protein complex. It has been demonstrated previously that the p50 homodimer provides transcriptional activation only when adopting a chymotrypsin-resistant conformation (12Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Google Scholar). Our present results suggest that the conformation of the p50 homodimer is altered in the presence of Rb, reducing its transcriptional activity and functioning as a transcriptional repressor. This repression, therefore, would be functionally different from that observed with E2F and explains why NF-κB was not detected in screening assays to identify promoter elements that are normally targeted by Rb (36Helin K. Lees J.A. Vidal M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Cell. 1992; 70: 337-350Google Scholar). Along these lines, it will be of interest to determine if Rb phosphorylation regulates the interaction of Rb and p50 in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The results presented in this report suggest that Rb is one of several cellular proteins that function to regulate p50 binding and activity. It has been demonstrated that the cellular proto-oncogene, Bcl-3, specifically inhibits binding of homodimeric p50 to DNA (37Nolan G.P. Fujita T. Bhatia T. Huppi C. Liou H.-C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 3557-3566Google Scholar, 38Franzosa G. Bours V. Azarenko V. Park S. Tomita-Yamaguchi M. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3893-3901Google Scholar). Interestingly, when coexpressed, Bcl-3 and p50 both localize to the nucleus and form a protein-protein complex that is detected in nuclear extracts. In contrast, IκB-α and IκB-γ inhibit p50 homodimer activity by inhibiting nuclear translocation. In this regard, Rb and Bcl-3 both function as nuclear inhibitors of p50. There are, however, distinct differences in the activities of Bcl-3 and Rb. Although Bcl-3 inhibits binding of the p50 homodimer, it does not inhibit binding of the p50-p65 heterodimer that can bind to the NF-κB site and activate transcription. Rb, in contrast, stimulates the binding of an inactive p50 homodimer to the NF-κB site, resulting in a decrease in transcription. NF-κB plays an important role in the response of lymphocytes to antigens and cytokines. In addition to the cytoplasmic regulation of NF-κB transport, Rb induction of transcriptionally inactive p50 homodimer binding may represent another important pathway for the regulation of nuclear NF-κB activity."

Most of the mutant enzymes were either partially defective or fully active in their abilities to catalyze the hydrolysis of PI or PIP2. However, upon substitution of Arg-549 by glycine or histidine, the mutant enzyme was defective in its ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of PIP2, but it is still able to hydrolyze PI. Replacing Arg-549 with lysine had little effect on the level of PI and PIP2 hydrolytic activities of the mutant enzyme. The residual PIP2 hydrolyzing activity of R549H is highly dependent on pH. R549H showed 5-10% of the PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of the native enzyme between pH 5 and 7 and nondetectable PIP2-hydrolyzing activity at pH 8. The PIP2-hydrolyzing activity of R549G was not detectable at all pH values. Kinetic analysis of PLCδ1-catalyzed PIP2 hydrolysis revealed that the micellar dissociation constant Ks and interfacial Michaelis constant Km were similar in the native, R549K, and R549H enzymes; but the specific activity at the saturated substrate mole fraction and infinite level of substrate (Vmax) of the R549H mutant were reduced by a factor of 15. PIP2 competitively inhibits the native enzyme to hydrolyze PI at both pH 7 and 8. However, PIP2 inhibits R549H only at pH 7.0 and does not inhibit R549G at either pH. Taken together, these results suggest that positive charge at position 549 of PLCδ1 protein is essential for the enzyme to recognize and catalyze the hydrolysis of PIP2 but not PI.

PLCγ has been shown to be activated following phosphorylation by nonreceptor or receptor protein tyrosine kinase activities (3Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol.

Although each isoform of PI-PLC has its distinct mode of cellular regulation, all eucaryotic PI-PLC isozymes can catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in vitro (2Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Google Scholar, 11Wilson D.B. Bross T.E. Hofmann S.L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11718-11724Google Scholar). Structural similarity among each isoform of PI-PLC has also been identified. Two highly homologous regions designated as X and Y have been found in all PI-PLCs isolated from eucaryotic sources (2Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Google Scholar). These two regions are important for the enzyme to catalyze the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, since partial deletion of either X or Y region has been shown to inactivate the catalytic function of the enzyme (12Ellis M.V.

Since only X region homologous sequences have been identified in bacterial enzymes (16Kuppe A. Evans L.M. McMillen D.A. Griffith O.H. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6077-6083Google Scholar), it has been suggested that residues directly involved in cleavage are located in the X region (17Rhee S.G. Park D.J. Park D. Cochrane C.G. Gimbrone M.A. Cellular and Molecular Mechanism of Inflammation: Signal Transduction. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1992Google Scholar). Part of this prediction has recently been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of X region amino acid residues that are invariant in all PI-PLCs from human to bacteria (18Cheng H.-F. Jiang M.-J. Chen C.-L. Liu S.-M. Wong L.-P. Lomasney J.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5495-5505Google Scholar). Although most of the mutations have little effect on the catalytic function of the enzyme, substitution of amino acid residues at three positions (Arg-338, Gly-341, and His-356) does render the enzyme completely incapable of hydrolyzing PI and PIP2. Since these mutant enzymes can still interact with PIP2 in a manner comparable with that of the native enzyme, it was concluded that these amino acids are involved in the cleavage step. Some residues in the X region, which are only conserved in eucaryotic PI-PLCs, have also been identified to be involved in the catalytic process (19Ellis M.V. U S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 69-75Google Scholar). In addition to the X homologous region, eucaryotic enzymes possess a conserved Y region that is missing in bacterial enzymes (16Kuppe A. Evans L.M. McMillen D.A. Griffith O.H. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6077-6083Google Scholar, 17Rhee S.G. Park D.J. Park D. Cochrane C.G. Gimbrone M.A. Cellular and Molecular Mechanism of Inflammation: Signal Transduction. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1992Google Scholar). Functions of the Y region and its conserved residues are unknown except for the hypothesis derived from the comparison of PI-PLC from eucaryotic cells and procaryotic cells. Bacterial PI-PLCs differ from eucaryotic enzymes in at least two aspects (17Rhee S.G. Park D.J. Park D. Cochrane C.G. Gimbrone M.A. Cellular and Molecular Mechanism of Inflammation: Signal Transduction. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1992Google Scholar). 1) The bacterial enzyme does not catalyze the hydrolysis of the higher order phosphorylated forms of inositol phospholipids, and 2) its ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of PI does not require calcium as a cofactor. This implies that the Y region of eucaryotic PI-PLC may be involved in Ca2+ binding and the specific catalytic hydrolysis of the higher phosphorylated form of inositol phospholipids. To verify this implication and to gain further insight into the functions of the Y region, conserved residues with positively charged side chains in the Y region were subjected to base substitution mutagenesis in the present study. The mutant PLCδ1 constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the mutant proteins were purified by two-step chromatography. To determine the functional consequence of these residue substitutions, we characterized the mutant proteins by their ability to bind PIP2 and to catalyze the hydrolysis of both PIP2 and PI. We also analyzed their dependence on pH, substrate, and calcium ion concentrations. Using these approaches, we are able to demonstrate that the positive charge at position 549 in human PLCδ1 is required for the enzyme to catalyze the hydrolysis of PIP2 but not PI. Full-length human PLCδ1 cDNA was inserted into the BamHI site of pRSETA(R), whose EcoRI site in the polylinker region was destroyed by filling-in reaction. The resulting expression construct (pRSETAplc(R)) was used in the present investigation for mutagenesis and for expression of the enzyme under the control of T7 promoter in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidylserine (PS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was obtained from Calbiochem. Site-directed point mutagenesis by a two-stage PCR method was used (20Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Google Scholar) with slight modification. Primary PCR steps consisted of two separate PCR reactions for each point mutation. One of the PCR reactions was initiated using a mutagenic primer and outer primers; the second was initiated by using an internal primer and the other an outer primer. The template DNA and all expression constructs used in the present investigation were pRAETAplc(R), in which the codon for Arg-527, −549, and −556 was flanked by two unique restriction endonuclease sites (SphI/EcoRI). The codon for Arg-701 was flanked by an EcoRI site in the PLCδ1 gene, and a HindIII site was located at the 3′-end of the polylinker region of pRAETAplc(R). The PCR took place in a reaction volume of 100 μl containing 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 0.01% gelatin (w/v), 1.5 mM Mg2+, 200 μM dNTPs, 10 pM template (pRESTAplc(R)), 1 μM primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. The reaction mixture was prewarmed to 55°C for 5 min; the 30-cycle 3-step PCR (94°C for 40 s, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min) was initiated by adding 0.5 μl (2.5 units) of Taq polymerase. The products of primary PCR reactions were separated electrophoretically and isolated in a low melting point agarose gel. The purified primary PCR products in low melting agarose were incubated at 70°C for 15 min and subsequently diluted with distilled H2O to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Equal volumes (20 μl) of two diluted primary PCR products were mixed, boiled to 100°C for 5 min, and slowly cooled to 30°C. The secondary PCR reaction was carried out in a volume of 100 μl, containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 0.01% gelatin (w/v), 1.5 mM Mg2+, 200 μM dNTPs, 50 ng of template (the mixed and annealed primary PCR products), 1 μM of two outer primers, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. Amplified mutant DNA fragments from the secondary PCR reaction were electrophoretically purified in low melting agarose, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified mutant DNA fragment was then digested with EcoRI and HindIII restriction endonuclease and used to replace the corresponding restriction fragment of the wild type pRSETAplc(R). The desired point mutation (Arg-701 to Gly) and sequence flanking by EcoRI and HindIII sites were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis from 10 independently isolated constructs containing mutant DNA fragments. For mutagenesis of Arg-527, −549, and −556 to Gly, the mutagenic PCR products from the secondary PCR were digested with SphI and EcoRI and cloned into the SphI/EcoRI-cleaved pRSETAplc(R), whose EcoRI in the polylinker region had been destroyed by T4 DNA polymerase filling-in and the subsequent self-ligation. BL21 (DE3) pLys cells harboring pRSETAplc plasmid were grown at 30°C in 1.5 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the A600 of the culture reached 1.0, 20 ml of 0.1 M isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added, and the culture was incubated at 18°C for an additional 8 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.1 M KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Tween 20. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. Cells were lysed by 2 cycles of microfluidizer. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant fraction (120 ml of 3.2 mg/ml protein) was directly applied to a column of 5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with a buffer of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.1 M KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A containing 15 mM imidazole and eluted with 50 ml of the same buffer containing 100 mM imidazole; the eluent was collected as 1.5 ml per fraction. The active fractions were identified by PI hydrolysis assay and then pooled. The partially purified PLCδ1 from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column was concentrated in an Amicon Centriprep-30 concentrator, diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer, and then directly applied to 1 ml of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) preequilibrated with lysis buffer. After being washed with 10 ml of the same buffer, PLCδ1 was eluted by a 50-ml linear salt gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 M KCl in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mM EDTA, and 5 mM EGTA. The active fractions were identified by PI hydrolysis activity or Western blotting and were pooled. Hydrolysis of PIP2 by PLCδ1 was determined as described previously (5Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Google Scholar) in an assay volume of 60 μl of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 3 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.83 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NaCl, 30 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.16% sodium cholate, 1.5 mM CaCl2 containing 50 μM PIP2 (8000 cpm), and 500 μM PE. The reaction was carried out at 30°C for 2-15 min and terminated by adding 0.2 ml of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and 0.1 ml of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml). Subsequent to incubation on ice for 15 min, the unhydrolyzed [3H]PIP2 (pellet) was separated from [3H]IP3 (supernatant) by centrifugation at 4°C, 2000 × g for 10 min. Radioactivity in the supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The activity of PIP2 hydrolysis is expressed as μmol of IP3/min/mg protein; 0.1-100 ng of purified recombinant PLCδ1 was used per assay. Determination of PI hydrolysis activity was essentially the same as described by Hofmann and Majerus (21Hofmann S.L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6461-6469Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a volume of 200 μl of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 3 mM CaCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% sodium cholate containing 30,000 cpm of [3H]PI (300 μM). After incubation at 37°C for 5-15 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:0.6), followed by 0.3 ml of 1 N HCl containing 5 mM EGTA. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation, and a 400-μl portion of upper aqueous phase was counted by liquid scintillation. For assays using dodecyl maltoside/PIP2 or dodecyl maltoside/PI mixed micelles as substrate were performed in a manner similar to those described by Cifuentes et al. (22Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Google Scholar) with slight modification. In brief, indicated amount of PIP2/[3H]PIP2 or PI/[3H]PI (4 × 105 cpm) in chloroform/methanol (19:1) were flush-dried under a stream of N2 and followed by lyophilization for 30 min. Lipids were solubilized by probe sonication in 0.95 ml of solution containing 300 μM of dodecyl maltoside, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EGTA. Fifty μl of bovine serum albumin in the same buffer was added to yield a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. When measuring the PLC activity as a function of mole fraction of substrate, the total concentrations of PIP2 were kept constant, and the variation of mole fraction of PIP2 was achieved by varying the total concentration of dodecyl maltoside. To assay the activity as a function of total concentration of PIP2 with fixed molar fraction of PIP2, the variation of PIP2 concentration was achieved by proportionally varying the total PIP2 and the total dodecyl maltoside in the mixed micelles. To assay the activity, 50 μl of dodecyl maltoside/PI or PIP2 mixed micelles was preincubated at 30°C for 5 min, and 0.1-100 ng of enzyme was added in a volume of 1 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding 2.5 μl of 40 mM of CaCl2 and incubated at 30°C for another 1-15 min. For the analysis of the hydrolysis of PI, the reactions were terminated by adding 250 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:0.6), followed by 75 μl of 1 N HCl containing 5 mM EGTA. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation, and a 100-μl portion of upper aqueous phase was counted by liquid scintillation. For the analysis of PIP2 hydrolysis, the reactions were stopped by adding 0.17 ml of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and 0.85 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml). After incubating on ice for 15 min, the unhydrolyzed [3H]PIP2 (pellet) was separated from [3H]IP3 (supernatant) by centrifugation at 4°C, 2000 × g for 10 min. PIP2 and PI hydrolysis catalyzed by native, R549H, and R549K PLCδ1 were measured as a function of total substrate concentration and mole fraction in dodecyl maltoside mixed micelles under Case I, Case II, and Case III conditions previously described for phospholipase A2 and PLCβ (23Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Google Scholar, 24James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Google Scholar). Case II involves determination of PLC activities with increasing mole fraction of substrate while keep the total substrate concentration constant. In Case III, the total concentration of diluent detergent (dodecyl maltoside) was fixed, and the PLC activities were measured with increasing concentration of the substrate. Dual phospholipid binding model of catalysis (Equation 1a and 1b) (23Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Google Scholar) was used to analyze the kinetic data. E+S⇄k−1k+1ES(Eq. 1a) ES+S⇄k−2k+2ESS→k3ES+P(Eq. 1b) This model takes into account the fact that the reaction catalyzed by PLCδ1 occurs at the water-lipid interface of the phosphoinositide/dodecyl maltoside mixed micelles. Initial binding of the enzyme to the water-lipid interface of the micelles is described by the micellar dissociation constant, Ks = k−1/k+1 (molar unit). This constant is dependent on both the total enzyme concentration and total substrate concentration. Once attached to the surface of mixed micelles, the enzyme searches for and binds to a second lipid molecule via the catalytic site. The binding of the second lipid molecule and the subsequent catalysis by PLCδ1 is described by the interfacial Michaelis constant, Km = (k−2+ k3)/k+2 (mole fraction, unitless). Initial rates of catalysis (ν) as a function of mole fraction of substrate in the mixed micelles measured under Case I and II conditions were fitted using Equation 2 (23Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Google Scholar) to obtain values of Vmax, Ks, and Km. ν=VmaxXsS0KmKs+KmS0+XsS0(Eq. 2) The absolute rate (Vmax) occurs at an infinite substrate concentration, and the saturated substrate mole fraction, S0, is the total substrate concentration, and Xs is the mole fraction of the substrate on the surface of the mixed micelles. When the diluent nonsubstrate phospholipids or detergents exhibit modulatory function on the catalytic reactions, then the initial rates of substrate hydrolysis (ν) as a function of total concentration of substrate at a fixed concentration of diluent dodecyl maltoside (T0) were fitted to Equation 3 (23Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Google Scholar). ν=VmaxS02KmKsT0+T0+KsKmS0+Km+1S02(Eq. 3) Phospholipid vesicles PE/PC (4:1 molar ratio) containing indicated concentration of PIP2 were prepared as described by Mueller et al. (25Mueller P. Chien T.F. Rudy B. Biophys. J. 1983; 44: 375-381Google Scholar) with slight modifications. A dry phospholipid film was formed by slowly blowing 0.25-ml solution of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing mixed lipids (320 nmol of PE, 80 nmol of PC, and indicated amount of PIP2 or PI) under a stream of nitrogen followed by freeze-drying in a vacuum for 4 h. The phospholipid film was hydrated under nitrogen with 1 ml of nitrogen-aerated 0.18 M sucrose solution for 18 h at 4°C followed by mixing with an equal volume of 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mM KCl, and 10 mM EGTA. Vesicles were isolated from the pellet by centrifuging the hydrated phospholipids at 1200 × g for 20 min. The phospholipid vesicles were washed once with 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM EGTA, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) (binding buffer) and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. The binding of PLCδ1 to phospholipid vesicles was estimated by centrifugation assay (26Rebecchi M. Peterson A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Google Scholar). The final assay volume was 0.2 ml containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM EGTA, and 200 μg/ml BSA (binding buffer) plus indicated concentrations of phospholipid vesicles and 1 μg of enzyme. To perform the assay, 1 μg of enzyme in 20 μl of binding buffer was incubated with 180 μl of mixed phospholipid vesicles in the same buffer at 30°C for 15 min. The free and bound PLCδ1 were separated by sedimentation of the samples at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The amounts of the free PLCδ1 (supernatant) and the bound enzyme (pellet) were determined by PI hydrolysis assay and Western blotting analysis. Single bilayer vesicles were prepared as described before (27Hofmann S.L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14359-14364Google Scholar) with slight modification. In brief, stock solution of individual lipids, 400,000 cpm of 30 nmol of [3H]PI, 150 nmol of PC, and 150 nmol of PS and indicated amount of PIP2 (0-15 nmol) were mixed and flushed dry under a stream of nitrogen. The dry lipids were resuspended with 0.95 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EGTA, and the mixture was vortexed and followed by 2 cycles of 15-s pulse probe sonication with 45-s cooling intervals in between an MSE sonicator. Samples were centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 60 min, and the clear supernatant was recovered. Fifty μl of bovine serum albumin was added to give a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. Routinely >90% of the phospholipid was recovered in the supernatant. Samples were bubbled with nitrogen, stored at room temperature, and used within 24 h. To assay the PI-PLC activity, 50 μl of SUV was preincubated at 37°C for 5 min, and 0.1-10 ng of enzyme in a volume of 1 μl was added. The reaction was initiated by adding 2.5 μl of 60 mM CaCl2 and incubated at 37°C for another 1-15 min; the reaction was terminated by adding 0.2 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:0.6), followed by 0.06 ml of 1 N HCl containing 5 mM EGTA. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation, and a 100-μl portion of upper aqueous phase was counted by liquid scintillation. Four highly conserved positively charged amino acid residues (Arg-527, −549, −556, and −701) were identified by sequence alignment in the Y region of eucaryotic PI-PLC (18Cheng H.-F. Jiang M.-J. Chen C.-L. Liu S.-M. Wong L.-P. Lomasney J.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5495-5505Google Scholar). To investigate the role of these residues in enzyme catalysis, they were individually mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to Gly. All mutations were introduced into recombinant PLCδ1 with 34-amino acid residues including 6 consecutive histidine residues fused to its N terminus (18Cheng H.-F. Jiang M.-J. Chen C.-L. Liu S.-M. Wong L.-P. Lomasney J.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5495-5505Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes were expressed in E. coli strain BL21, purified by Ni2+-NAT-agarose followed by heparin-Sepharose column chromatography. The homogeneity of the mutant protein was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting analysis (data not shown). Preliminary enzymatic characterization of mutant enzymes by PI- and PIP2- hydrolysis assays allowed us to categorize these mutants into three classes (Table I). The first class, Arg-527 → Gly, had little effect on either PI or PIP2 hydrolysis activity. The second class of mutants, in which Arg-556 or Arg-701 was replaced by Gly, was partially defective in catalyzing both the hydrolysis of PIP2 and PI. In the third class of mutant enzyme, Arg-549 was replaced by Gly; its PIP2 hydrolysis activity was not detectable, but it was able to catalyze the hydrolysis of PI at 15% efficiency compared with that of the native enzyme. This suggests that although these four Arg residues are highly conserved or invariant in all eucaryotic PI-PLCs, they may play different roles in either maintaining the structure of the enzyme or in its catalytic function. To focus the scope of the present investigation on the molecular mechanism of substrate selectivity by PLCδ1, only the R549G mutant, whose ability to hydrolyze PIP2 was selectively eliminated, was subjected to further structural and functional characterization.Table I.In vitro characterization of human PLCδ1 mutantsType of enzymeEnzymatic activityaPIP2 and PI hydrolysis activities were determined as described (5, 21) and expressed as release of μmol of IP3 or IP per min per mg of enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”).PIPIP2μmol/min/mgNative PLCδ164 ± 737 ± 5R527G(Arg-527 → Gly)55 ± 633 ± 4R556G(Arg-556 → Gly)3 ± 15 ± 2R701G(Arg-701 → Gly)2 ± 0.65 ± 2R549G(Arg-549 → Gly)12 ± 3<0.5R549H(Arg-549 → His)58 ± 64 ± 2R549K(Arg-549 → Lys)35 ± 730 ± 5a PIP2 and PI hydrolysis activities were determined as described (5Hepler J.R.

Open table in a new tab Since the side chain of Gly is a proton whose ability to interact with functional groups of the substrate or other functional side chains in the protein backbone is minimal, replacing Arg-549 by Gly may create a subtle structural effect on the enzyme in general or may alter specific interactions between the enzyme and PIP2. To address this concern, we further examined the effect of the chemical and physical compositions of the side chain at position 549 on the cleavage activity of PLCδ1 by making a more conservative substitution at position 549; the arginine residue was replaced individually with lysine or histidine. For mutant enzyme in which Arg-549 was converted to His (R549H), its ability to hydrolyze PIP2 (4 μmol/min/mg) was selectively reduced to 10% of that of the native enzyme (37 μmol/min/mg), while its ability to hydrolyze PI (58 μmol/min/mg) was comparable with that of native enzyme (64 μmol/min/mg) (Table I). These results indicate that replacing Arg-549 w"
https://openalex.org/W2109273356,"Abstract Combinatorial peptide libraries have proved to be a valuable tool for the study of the interaction of a functional protein with its ligand. Here, the epitope for a monoclonal antibody 201/9, raised against β-factor XIIa, has been identified with a two-step approach using peptide libraries attached to a polymer (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane. First, the octapeptide libraries with two amino acids defined at position 2 and 4, represented by the formula X-O2-X-O4-X-X-X-X, were synthesized on a sheet of polymer membrane in which X represents a mixture of all the natural L-amino acids except cysteine, while O2 and O4 each represent a single amino acid. The libraries were probed with the antibody 201/9, and the bound antibody was detected with a sensitive chemiluminescent method. In the first cycle, the peptide mixtures X-Phe-X-Gln-X-X-X-X showed the strongest signal development. In the second cycle Phe and Gln were incorporated into new libraries consisting of sequences O1-Phe-X-Gln-X-X-X-X, X-Phe-O3-Gln-X-X-X-X, X-Phe-X-Gln-O5-X-X-X, X-Phe-X-Gln-X-O6-X-X, X-Phe-X-Gln-X-X-O7-X, and X-Phe-X-Gln-X-X-X-O8. After probing these new peptides, the residues representing the core sequence of the epitope for monoclonal antibody 201/9 were elucidated. The sequence Ser-Phe-Leu-Gln-Glu-Asn, identified as the immunodominant epitope, correlates well with the sequence Ser-Phe-Leu-Gln-Glu-Ala previously identified (Gao, B., and Esnouf, M. P. (1996) J. Immunol. 157, 183-188) in a scan of overlapping peptides based on the sequence of human β-factor XIIa."

Oxy forms of Hb A2δE6V and Hb A2δE6V,δQ87T were 2- and 1.6-fold, respectively, less stable than oxy-Hb S, while the stability of Hb A2δE6V,δA22E,δQ87T was similar to that of Hb S, suggesting that Alaδ22 and Glnδ87 contribute to the surface hydrophobicity of Hb A2. Deoxy Hb A2δE6V polymerized without a delay time, like deoxy Hb F γE6V, while deoxy Hb A2δE6V,δQ87T and deoxy Hb A2δE6V,δA22E,δQ87T polymerized after a delay time, like deoxy Hb S, suggesting that β87 Thr is required for the formation of nuclei. Deoxy Hb F γE6V,γQ87T showed no delay time and required a 3.5-fold higher concentration than deoxy Hb S for polymerization, suggesting that Thr effects on Valδ6 Hb A2 and Valγ6 Hb F variants are different. Mixtures of deoxy Hb S/Hb A2δE6V,δQ87T polymerized, like deoxy Hb S, while polymerization of Hb S/Hb A2δE6V mixtures was inhibited, like Hb S/Hb F γE6V mixtures. These results suggest α2βSδ6 Val, 87 Thr hybrids and Hb A2δE6V,δQ87T participate in Hb S nucleation, while only 50% of α2βSδ6 Val hybrids and none of the Hb A2δE6V participate. These findings are in contrast to those of mixtures of Hb S with Hb F γE6V or Hb F γE6V,Q87T, which both inhibit Hb S polymerization.

https://openalex.org/W2134631041,"Three Hb S variants containing Glu substitutions at Phe-β85 and/or Leu-β88 were expressed in yeast in an effort to evaluate the role of hydrophobic amino acids at these sites in stabilizing F helix conformation of Hb S. Helix stability of tetrameric Hb S βF85E,βL88E was measured by CD and compared with those of Hb S βF85E, Hb S βL88E, Hb A, and Hb S. The CD spectra of these Hb S variants were similar to those of Hb S and Hb A at 10°C. However, changes in ellipticity at 222 nm for Hb S βF85E in the CO form at 60°C were about 15-fold greater than that of Hb S, while those for Hb S βL88E and Hb S βF85E,βL88E were similar and about 30-fold greater than Hb S. Thermal stability measured by continuous scanning of spectral changes revealed the three Hb S variants were much more unstable than Hb S, and stability of Hb S βF85E,βL88E was similar to that of Hb S βL88E rather than Hb S βF85E. These results suggest that Glu insertion at both β85 and β88 makes heme insertion into the heme pocket more difficult; however, once inserted, stability of Hb S βF85E,βL88E is similar to Hb S βL88E rather than Hb S βF85E. Furthermore, these results suggest that both Phe-β85 and Leu-β88 are critical for F helix stabilization and that Glu insertion at β88 leads to more destabilization than insertion at β85.

In addition to Val-β6, the key to polymerization of deoxy-Hb S is formation of a Val-β6 hydrophobic acceptor pocket containing the hydrophobic amino acids Phe-β85 and Leu-β88 in the F helices of the T structure or deoxy form of Hb S which interacts with Val-β6 (1Wishner B.C. Ward K.B. Lattman E.E. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 179-194Google Scholar, 2Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution and Pathology. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., Menlo Park, CA1983: 125Google Scholar). Therefore, characterization of the Val-β6 acceptor site, which includes Phe-β85 and Leu-β88, is important to understand hydrophobic interactions of deoxy-Hb S polymerization. We previously engineered and expressed Hb S variants containing Glu at either β85 or β88, Hb S βF85E, and Hb S βL88E and characterized their polymerization properties in order to understand the role of hydrophobicity and stereospecificity of the acceptor pocket during deoxy-Hb S polymerization (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar). The deoxy form of Hb S βL88E polymerized in vitro at a much higher hemoglobin concentration than deoxy-Hb S containing other amino acid substitutions at β85 and β88 such as Hb S βF85E and Hb S βL88F (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar). Furthermore, kinetics of polymerization for Hb S βL88E were biphasic at lower hemoglobin concentrations. Deoxy-Hb S βF85E also polymerized like deoxy-Hb S βL88E; however, the concentration required for polymerization of Hb S βF85E was 3-fold less than that of Hb S βL88E. These differences in polymerization between having Glu at β85 versus β88 may be due to residue location in the acceptor pocket. X-ray analysis of crystallized deoxy-Hb S shows that β85 and β88 amino acid side chains line the bottom of the acceptor pocket (1Wishner B.C. Ward K.B. Lattman E.E. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 179-194Google Scholar, 2Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution and Pathology. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., Menlo Park, CA1983: 125Google Scholar), with Phe-β85 located internally at the floor of the pocket and Leu-β88 located near the pocket entrance. This difference in location might be expected to lead to different results when making the same Glu change at these two sites. Polymerization properties of several other recombinant Hb S variants containing changes at β85 and β88 have been studied, and those studies clarified the importance of stereospecificity of the acceptor pocket in interacting with Val-β6 in Hb S (4De Llano J.J.M. Manning J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Google Scholar, 5Adachi K. Konitzer P. Paulraj C.G. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17477-17480Google Scholar, 6Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Reddy K.S. Surrey S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1272-1278Google Scholar). In order to further understand the role of hydrophobicity of the acceptor pocket, we prepared Hb S containing hydrophilic Glu residues at both β85 and β88, Hb S βF85E,βL88E. In this report we characterized F helix stability of 1) Hb S βF85E,βL88E, 2) Hb S βL88E, and 3) Hb S βF85E and compared the results with those of Hb A and Hb S. The plasmid pGS389 βS contains the full-length human α- and βS-globin cDNAs under transcriptional control of dual GGAP promoters, as well as a partially functional yeast LEU2d gene and the URA3 gene for selection in yeast (7Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Google Scholar, 8Wagenbach M. O'Rourke K. Vitez L. Wieczorek A. Hoffman S. Dufee S. Tedesco J. Stetler G.L. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 57-61Google Scholar). The plasmid pGS189 βS contains a single GGAP promoter and βS-globin cDNA and was constructed by mutagenesis and subcloning as described previously (7Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Google Scholar). The basic strategy for site-specific mutagenesis at the β85 and β88 positions involves recombination polymerase chain reaction as described previously (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar, 7Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Google Scholar). βSF85E cDNA was then used as a template to introduce the additional Glu-β88. The three Hb S variants were subjected to DNA sequence analysis of the entire β-globin cDNA using site-specific primers and fluorescently tagged terminators in a cycle-sequencing reaction in which extension products were analyzed on an automated DNA sequencer (7Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Google Scholar, 9Trifillis P. Ioannou P. Schwartz E. Surrey S. Blood. 1991; 78: 3298-3305Google Scholar). The mutated β-globin cDNA regions were then excised by XhoI digestion and subcloned back into the XhoI site of the expression vector pGS389 (4De Llano J.J.M. Manning J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Google Scholar). Yeast growth and plasmid transformation, induction, and purification of recombinant hemoglobin tetramers were described previously (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar, 7Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Google Scholar, 8Wagenbach M.

Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 807-810Google Scholar). Abnormal forms of recombinant hemoglobins, which may include sulphaem-containing and/or misfolded hemoglobins, were eliminated by chromatographic purification (10Adachi K. Konitzer P. Lai C.H. Kim J. Surrey S. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 807-810Google Scholar, 11Hofmann O.M. Mould R.M. Brittain T. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 281-283Google Scholar). Hb S βF85E,βL88E was further purified using an FPLC 1The abbreviations used are: FPLCfast protein liquid chromatography. Mono Q column with a linear gradient from 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 (buffer A), to 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, at 4°C to remove free α chains. Purified Hb S variants were subjected to electrospray mass analysis (Fisons Instruments, VG Biotech, Altrincham, UK) using the multiply charged ion peaks from the α-globin chain (Mr = 15,126.4) as an external reference for mass scale calibrations (12Shackleton C.H. Witkowska H.E. Desiderio D.M. Mass Spectrometry: Clinical and Biomedical Applications. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1994: 135Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified α chain was directly confirmed by Edman degradation employing a pulsed-liquid, protein sequencer (ABI 477A, Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Absorption spectra of the purified Hb variants were recorded using a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. CD spectra of the variants were recorded using an Aviv model 62 DS instrument employing a 0.1-cm light path cuvette at ~10 μM Hb concentrations, and the temperature was controlled with a thermoelectric module. Thermal denaturation of hemoglobins was evaluated by monitoring temperature-induced changes in ellipticity at 222 nm using a temperature control unit and by repetitive scanning of the absorption spectra of hemoglobins in 10 mM phosphate buffer at constant temperature using a Hitachi U-3000 absorption spectrophotometer. Deoxyhemoglobin solutions were prepared by flushing with nitrogen and by adding a 2-3-fold molar excess of sodium dithionite. fast protein liquid chromatography. Recombinant Hb S tetramers containing Glu-β85 or Glu-β88 substitutions were purified on a Mono S column, and migrated as a single band following cellulose acetate electrophoresis, pH 8.6, with a more negative surface charge compared with normal human Hb S (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that FPLC Mono S column purification of Hb S βF85E,βL88E showed two peaks, while the other variants showed only a single peak of tetramer at this stage of purification (Fig. 1). Electrophoretic and amino acid sequence analysis indicated the major peak that eluted with the first buffer prior to gradient elution of the Hb S variant contained free α chains. The ratio of free α chains to this Hb S variant was more than 8:1. Purified Hb S βF85E,βL88E migrated as a single band following cellulose acetate electrophoresis, and its yield was very low (5-8% of that of the other two Hb S variants) probably because of precipitation of the βS variant chain before assembly with α chains in yeast. Mass spectral analysis of the three βS variants showed expected β-globin chain molecular weights (15,834 Da for βS Glu-β85 and Glu-β88; 15,818 Da for βS Glu-β85; 15,853 Da for βS Glu-β88; and 15,837 Da for βS). Absorption spectra in the UV and visible ranges of the CO forms of these three Hb S variants were the same as those of native and recombinant Hb S. The CD spectrum in the region from 190 to 290 nm for Hb S βF85E,βL88E at 10°C was similar to those of Hb S βL88E and Hb S βF85E as well as native Hb S and Hb A (Fig. 2). These results indicate that once the βS chain variants assemble with α chains, substitutions from hydrophobic to hydrophilic amino acids at β85 and β88 do not significantly affect globin folding and/or overall secondary structure of hemoglobin tetramers at low temperature (10°C). Initiation of polymer formation by deoxy-Hb S βF85E,βL88E required much higher hemoglobin concentrations than that of Hb S βF85E or Hb S βL88E even in high phosphate buffers, and due to its low yield (5-8% of that of the Hb S Glu-β85 or Hb S Glu-β88 variants), we were unable to characterize polymerization properties of the double Glu-containing Hb S variant. Helix thermal stability for Hb S βF85E,βL88E in the CO form was measured by monitoring temperature-induced CD changes in ellipticity at 222 nm at 60°C. These results were then compared with those of Hb S βF85E, Hb S βL88E, Hb S, and Hb A. Changes in ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of incubation time at 60°C for Hb A and Hb S were minimal (Fig. 3). In contrast, signals for all three Hb S variants changed dramatically under the same conditions. The rate of change for Hb S βF85E was 15-fold greater than that of Hb S, while the rate of change for Hb S βL88E or Hb S βF85E,βL88E was 30-fold greater than that of Hb S. Changes for Hb S βF85E,βL88E were similar to Hb S βL88E rather than Hb S βF85E. These results suggest that both Phe-β85 and Leu-β88 are critical for stabilization and that a single Glu substitution at β85 in Hb S has less effect on pocket destabilization than that of a single Glu at β88. Furthermore, our results show that there was no further effect on destabilization of the pocket by insertion of Glu at β85 in the Glu-β88-substituted variant. We also measured stability of the Glu-substituted Hb S variants at elevated temperatures in order to evaluate effects of β85 and β88 substitutions on globin stability as well as heme oxidization. Heat stability tests of Hb S βF85E,βL88E in different liganded forms were measured by repetitive scanning of their absorption spectra between 200 and 700 nm at 1-min intervals at constant temperature. These results were then compared with those for Hb S βF85E, Hb S βL88E, Hb A, and Hb S. Absorption spectra of the three variants, Hb A, and Hb S were measured at 45°C for oxy and at 60°C for CO and deoxy forms (Fig. 4). Stabilities of Hb S in the different liganded forms were similar to that for Hb A, and both showed minimal changes in absorbance at constant temperature after repetitive scans. In contrast, stabilities for all three Hb S variants changed dramatically under the same conditions. Hb S βF85E,βL88E was the most unstable with instabilities ordered as follows: Hb S βF85E,βL88E > Hb S βL88E > Hb S βF85E ≫ Hb S and Hb A. Under these conditions, positions of absorption spectra peaks for all hemoglobin samples in the visible range were not significantly shifted even though their total peak heights and base-line values changed as a function of incubation time. Changes in base-line value as a function of time are caused by increased turbidity due to the precipitated hemoglobin. Soret band peaks (~410 nm) and visible range peak positions for all hemoglobins did not change, but absorption in the UV range for oxy and CO forms of the Hb S variants was significantly altered with increasing turbidity during incubation. These results suggest that precipitation of the Hb S variants occurred without heme oxidation and that unfolding of globins directly causes precipitation under these conditions. After 20 repetitive scans (20 min), precipitates were removed by centrifugation, and soluble hemoglobin concentration was determined from its absorption spectra (Fig. 5). The percentage of total hemoglobin in the oxy form, which precipitated after 20 min at 45°C, for Hb A, Hb S, Hb S βF85E, Hb S βL88E, and Hb S βF85E,βL88E was 2.4, 6.1, 18.6, 27, and 30%, respectively. In contrast, when the temperature was raised to 60°C, oxy-Hb S βF85E,βL88E underwent heme oxidation like Hb S βF85E, Hb S βL88E, and Hb S in the oxy form as reported previously (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar), and all three Hb S variants quickly precipitated within 5 min.Fig. 5Comparison of thermal stability for Hb S βF85E,βL88E, Hb S βF85E, and Hb S βL88E. Percentage of denatured Hb S βF85E,βL88E (e), Hb S βL88E (d), and Hb S βF85E (c) in different liganded forms was determined by removal of precipitated hemoglobins after 20 repetitive scans and then measuring remaining soluble hemoglobin. Results were then compared with those of Hb A (a) and Hb S (b). Experimental conditions were the same as those described in Fig. 4 with A, B, and C indicating oxy, CO, and deoxy forms, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CO and deoxy forms of the variant hemoglobins at 60°C were more stable than oxy forms, and the heme moieties did not undergo oxidization under these conditions. Percentages of precipitated hemoglobins in the CO and deoxy forms after 20 min of incubation at 60°C are shown in Fig. 5. Values for CO forms of Hb A, Hb S, Hb S βF85E, Hb S βL88E, and Hb S βF85E,βL88E were 16.4, 35.2, 54.1, 72.1, and 78.3%, respectively. In addition, deoxy forms were more stable than the corresponding CO forms. Values for deoxy forms of Hb A, Hb S, Hb S βF85E, Hb S βL88E and Hb S βF85E,βL88E were 0.5, 1.3, 14, 26 and 27%, respectively. X-ray crystallographic analysis showed that Phe-β85 and Leu-β88 are located on the F helix, which is also near the position of porphyrin in the heme pocket of the hemoglobin molecule. Heme is then inserted into a hydrophobic cleft on the surface subunit. The side chain of Leu-β88 (F4) contacts the heme side chain (13Perutz M.F. Muirhead H. Cox J.M. Goaman L.C.G. Nature. 1968; 219: 131-139Google Scholar), and binding of heme to globin involves a specific stereochemical fit that helps stabilize tertiary conformation of the subunit. Phe-β85 (F1) is also near the heme pocket and acts as a spacer between the F and H helical segments (13Perutz M.F. Muirhead H. Cox J.M. Goaman L.C.G. Nature. 1968; 219: 131-139Google Scholar). These two hydrophobic amino acids on the F helix are important in maintaining the hydrophobic environment of the heme pocket and in protecting against entrance of water molecules. Heme insertion can also stabilize globin chain structure (14Yip Y.K. Waks M. Beychok S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7237-7244Google Scholar, 15Waks M. Yip Y.K. Beychok S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6462-6476Google Scholar). Our results showing large amounts of free α chains after cell lysis and low yield for only the double Glu-containing Hb S variant, Hb S βF85E,βL88E, suggest that substitution of hydrophilic amino acids such as Glu at both β85 and β88 possibly inhibits heme insertion into the pocket. In addition, our findings imply that apo-βSF85E,βL88E chains precipitate before assembly with α chains; however, tetramers that do form, even though low yield, appear to fold like the single Glu-containing Hb S tetramers as well as like Hb A and Hb S, as assessed by CD studies. Upon deoxygenation of Hb S, these hydrophobic sites on the F helix can form an acceptor pocket to contact with Val-β6 in a neighboring Hb S molecule, which promotes polymerization and sickling of red cells. Therefore, hydrophilic substitutions like Glu for Phe-β85 and Glu for Leu-β88 should reduce hydrophobic interactions and result in inhibition of deoxy-Hb S polymerization (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar). X-ray analysis of crystallized deoxy-Hb S shows that β85 and β88 amino acid side chains line the bottom of the acceptor pocket (1Wishner B.C. Ward K.B. Lattman E.E. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 179-194Google Scholar), with Phe-β85 located internally at the pocket floor. The 3-fold lower critical concentration required for polymerization of deoxy-Hb S βF85E compared with deoxy-Hb S βL88E can be explained by the composition and geometry of the acceptor pocket (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar). Although Phe-β85 and Leu-β88 line the floor of the pocket in the F helix, Leu-β88 is located near the pocket entrance, while Phe-β85 is located internally at the pocket floor (1Wishner B.C. Ward K.B. Lattman E.E. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 179-194Google Scholar, 2Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution and Pathology. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., Menlo Park, CA1983: 125Google Scholar). Changing Leu to Glu at β88 might then be expected to have more influence on interaction with Val-β6 than changes at Phe-β85. In addition, changes at β88 are also expected to increase oxygen affinity and decrease tetramer stability. In fact, our previous studies with the hydrophilic substitutions of Glu for both Phe-β85 and Leu-β88 showed increased oxygen affinity and decreased tetramer stability (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar, 6Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Reddy K.S. Surrey S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1272-1278Google Scholar). Our present results show that Hb S variants containing Glu substitutions at β85 or β88 as well as at both positions were less stable than Hb A and Hb S. Thermal stability of oxy-Hb S βL88E at 45°C was slightly less than that of Hb S βF85E. Temperature-induced precipitation of these variants appears to occur by unfolding of chains in the absence of heme oxidation. In contrast, the oxy forms of the three Hb S variants as well as Hb A and Hb S all undergo ferric Hb formation upon incubation at 60°C. The three Hb S variants containing Glu at β85 and/or β88 then quickly precipitate (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar). Thermal stability of oxy-Hb S βL88E at 60°C was similar to oxy-Hb S βF85E (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar). In contrast, CO hemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin are generally stable compared with oxyhemoglobins because of protection from heme oxidation. CO and deoxy forms of Hb S βL88E were more unstable than Hb S βF85E, while thermal stability for Hb S βF85E,βL88E was similar to that for Hb S βL88E. These results with the three Hb S variants were the same as their relative stabilities as measured by CD temperature-induced changes in ellipticity at 222 nm and suggest that hydrophobicity at β85 and β88 is more critical in stabilizing globin chain structure than in maintaining heme stability. Furthermore, Glu insertion at β88 in the F helix appears to destabilize pocket structure much more than Glu insertion at β85. These results are also in agreement with our previous findings showing that Phe insertion at β85 inhibited Hb S polymerization less than Phe insertion at β88. In addition, oxy-Hb S βL88E was less stable than Hb S βF85E to mechanical agitation, which relates to surface hydrophobicity of dimeric hemoglobin (3Adachi K. Reddy L.R. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31563-31566Google Scholar). These results suggest that hydrophobic amino acids at β85 and β88 contribute to stabilization of globin structure and heme insertion as well as to stability of αβ assembly of hemoglobin. Detailed structural analysis of the acceptor sites in these different Hb S variants is now important to further our understanding of key hydrophobic interactions that promote polymerization of deoxy-Hb S.
