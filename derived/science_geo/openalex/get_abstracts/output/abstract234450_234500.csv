https://openalex.org/W1963664510,"WE have been concerned with the chromatographic separation of proteins and have developed a simple method of location of proteins on a paper chromatogram or a cellulose column. We have utilized the fact that acid dyes have an affinity for protein fibres but not for cellulose. The developed chromatogram is treated with an acid solution of a suitable dyestuff, preferably warmed for a few minutes, then rinsed in water, when the proteins appear as coloured spots or streaks on a white background. Amino-acids and peptides are not stained."
https://openalex.org/W2614255076,"A. L. LEVY1 has described the preparation of anhydro-N-carboxy-DL-β-phenylalanine (II, R=CH2Ph) by the action of phosgene on DL-β-phenylalanine. Prior to this, Fuchs2 described the preparation of anhydro-N-carboxy-N-phenyl- and N-p-tolyl-glycine by phosgenation of the parent acids in aqueous solution. Isatoic anhydride3, the analogous compound from anthranilic acid, has been similarly prepared. A modified method based on this reaction of Fuchs has been used recently by several workers in these laboratories. The process, which is fairly generally applicable and has been protected by a patent application4, consists of suspending the powdered α-amino-acid in a dry inert solvent, for example, dioxan or tetrahydrofuran, at 30°–40° and passing in gaseous phosgene with stirring until the acid is dissolved. Removal of solvent and excess phosgene by heating in vacuo at 40° then affords the anhydro-N-carboxy derivative (II), the intermediate N- substituted carbamyl chloride (I) being decomposed with the loss of hydrochloric acid during the treatment:"

https://openalex.org/W1997711040,"THE study of the complex mixture obtained on hydrolysis of the polysaccharides has been facilitated by the application of the methods of partition chromatography1 to the study of carbohydrates2. Using these methods, the mucilage obtained from the sperms of linseed (Linum usitotissimum var. Redwing) by extraction with water is under investigation. This mucilage is of special interest because it has been proved that the rarely occurring hexose, L-galactose, is a constituent sugar3. Hilger4 reported the presence of xylose, glucose, arabinose, galactose, and an acidic fraction, which was later identified as an aldobionic acid consisting of D-galacturonic acid and L-rhamnose5. However, later workers have not confirmed the presence of arabinose or glucose."

https://openalex.org/W2029836223,"Holtz, Credner and Kroneberg1 some years ago showed that in human urine there is a sympathetic pressor substance called by them ‘urosympathin’. In patients with essential hypertension, ‘urosympathin’ was secreted in larger quantities than in normal individuals. The active substance isolated by absorption on aluminium hydroxide and elution with sodium dihydrogen phosphate was evaluated against adrenaline using the blood pressure of the cat for assay. A dose of ‘urosympathin’ equal in this assay to a certain amount of adrenaline had a Weaker effect on the blood pressure of the rabbit and on the isolated rabbit intestine. Contrary to adrenaline, its pressor effect was not reversed by sympathicolytics but only weakened. Polyphenoloxidase destroyed its activity. Where the ‘urosympathin’ differed pharmacologically from adrenaline, it resembled the demethylated derivative nor-adrenaline or arterenol. Experiments2 not yet published showed that the ‘urosympathin’ of animals' urine also contains arterenol as chief constituent."

https://openalex.org/W2023975501,"FLAME photometric analysis1 of cations in biological fluids and tissues is, because of its simplicity, rapidity and greater accuracy, replacing laborious chemical procedures. The vaporization of alkali metal solutions in constant amount per minute into a controlled low-temperature air–acetylene flame produces simple emission spectra, the light intensities of which, measured photo-electrically after slit isolation of the most sensitive line spectrum for the particular element (potassium red flame at 7665 A.), are practically proportional to their concentrations for low concentrations2."

https://openalex.org/W2009670546,"IN studying the nitration of maize and potato starch, we observed that : (a) a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, containing a high proportion of pseudo-nitric acid, namely, an equimolecular mixture of water, nitric and sulphuric acid1, leads to the formation of nitric esters of low nitrogen content (7.1 per cent) ; (b) in the nitration of starch by means of such mixed acids containing decreasing quantities of water and increasing amounts of free sulphur tri-oxide, the degree of nitration of starch is controlled by the proportion of water and sulphur trioxide, respectively, in the nitrating mixture. Nitrates of starch, containing about 13 per cent of nitrogen, could be obtained easily when mixtures of pure nitric acid and oleum2 (2–3 per cent sulphur trioxide) were used. A similar observation has been reported by Fabel3 in the case of the nitration of cellulose. Caesar et al.4 have also found that starches, cellulose and disaccharides are completely and rapidly nitrated by nitrogen pentoxide and that the nitrates thus produced have an unusually high nitrogen content (about 13.9 per cent)."
https://openalex.org/W2027096186,"THE use of the horizontal-type still for molecular distillation has been developed by P. Meunier and Y. Raoul1, and has the advantage of being simple in operation. The present apparatus we have designed eliminates the mechanical part usually attached to the still. Indeed, during operation of the horizontal still, tilting of the apparatus is necessary in order to effect the flow of the liquid along the condenser. This repeated operation results in a gradual concentration of the liquid at one part of the apparatus, thus leaving a big area of the condenser ineffective during the distillation."

https://openalex.org/W2056901791,"ONE of the major factors determining line-breadth in electron diffraction powder patterns has been shown1–3 to be the refraction of the electron beam resulting from the finite inner potential of the crystals. Striking differences in line-breadth occur in patterns from crystals of regular habit, such as the cubes of magnesium oxide and cadmium oxide smokes and the elongated hexagonal prisms of zinc oxide smoke. Certain reflexions, for example, h00 in magnesium and cadmium oxides, and 00l in zinc oxide, are sharply defined, and it has been shown by Cowley and Rees2 that the refraction components lie along these rings and do not contribute to the line-breadths. Moreover, any elongation of reflexions arising from the non-spherical symmetry of the scattering function about the reciprocal lattice points for zinc oxide of this habit will lie along these rings also. Nevertheless, these breadths are still greater than can be accounted for by limitation of crystal dimensions and the finite breadth of the beam."

https://openalex.org/W2006709375,"A REPORT has just been published1 of the Fourth Summer Seminar in Physical Anthropology held in New York at the end of August 1949 under the auspices of the Viking Fund. The evolutionary significance of the South African fossil anthropoids (Australopithecinae) was discussed at several of the meetings, and at one I gave a short account of some comparisons, made by the appropriate statistical methods, and in collaboration with my colleague, Mr. E. H. Ashton, between the dimensions of the teeth of the fossils and those of existing apes. The conclusions to which they point disagree with the claims of a number of workers2 that in their size and shape the fossil teeth are in general more hominid than anthropoid. Comparisons made dimension by dimension and index by index have revealed few significant differences from all three types of extant great ape. Thus, of seventy-five dental characters of Plesianthropus, only four differed from the gorilla and none from the orang; and of twenty-six of Australopithecus prometheus none differed from either the gorilla or orang-outang."

https://openalex.org/W2083663360,"IN a communication in Nature of October 22, 1949, Bárány and Nordquist1 reported certain observations on the action of histamine on nerve block caused by procaine and pyribenzamine. They were led to perform these experiments because histamine has been found in nerves2,3, because most antihistaminic drugs are local anæsthetics, and because it has been shown that the local anæsthetic procaine also has an antihistaminic action4,5. Bárány and Nordquist found that, using the gastrocnemius muscle as an index of conduction in the frog sciatic nerve, histamine antagonized the local anæsthetic action of procaine and pyribenzamine. But it must be remarked that the concentration of histamine used, 0.4–0.6 per cent histamine dihydrochloride, was very large and unlikely to be encountered under physiological conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2078198038,"IT has been observed, when using short pulses of tone for echo-location in auditoria, that pulses which are too short to give any clear impression of pitch when heard directly from a loudspeaker seem to assume a more definite pitch when radiated into an auditorium. One of us mentioned this point at a recent meeting of the Acoustics Group of the Physical Society, and, as several contributors to the discussion questioned the effect, it is thought that this account of controlled tests will be of interest."

https://openalex.org/W2088146655,"MUCH of the recent development in the kinetics of chemical reactions has been concerned with the absolute evaluation of rate constants for the elementary reactions comprising a complex process. This has been carried out mainly indirectly in photo-reactions, using intermittent radiation to determine the life of the radical or chain concerned in the rate-controlling step. It would, however, be much more desirable in such reactions to be able to determine these life-times directly, by delineating the rise in concentration of a radical following the commencement of irradiation and the corresponding decay when irradiation is stopped. This can be done in principle, given a method of detecting reaction which is both highly sensitive and also very rapid in response, since life-times may be as short as 10−3 sec. These stringent requirements have now been met in the case of the liquid-phase polymerization of vinyl compounds by the construction of an instrument for following the change in dielectric constant which accompanies the reaction. This instrument has a sensitivity of 1 part in 108 of dielectric constant and a response time of 10−4 sec.; the frequency of operation is 50 Mc./s. We are indebted for the design of the instrument to Dr. C. M. Burrell, of the Radar Research and Development Establishment, and to the Ministry of Supply for invaluable help in its construction."
https://openalex.org/W2986660142,"IT is of great interest, particularly in cosmic ray experiments, to employ scintillation counters which have a large sensitive area. The first essential is a large transparent crystal. Crystals of naphthalene containing 1 per cent of anthracene and of size up to 8 in. in diameter and ½ in. thick have been grown, and undoubtedly it will be possible to use large crystals of other substances in the future. Here, however, we are concerned only with the optical problems which arise when large crystals are used. The aim of this note is to direct attention to a useful development in this field."
