Evidence provided by the fossil record, primate behavior, and demographic analysis shows that the traditional view that early human evolution was a direct consequence of brain expansion and material culture is incorrect, and that the unique sexual and reproductive behavior of man may be the sine qua non of human origin."

Biomass and productivity relations, species diversity, and nutrient cycling patterns are closely tied to this cycle of disturbance. Disturbance is thus an integral part of the long-term maintenance of this ecosystem. Since forests of this type normally include all phases of the disturbance-regeneration cycle, they may constitute a steady-state ecosystem in equilibrium with the surrounding environment."
https://openalex.org/W2110473595,A ridge and thermokarst-basin landscape that is strikingly portrayed in Landsat winter imagery consists of large Pleistocene dunes that have been modified by younger eolian activity and thermokarst processes. This is the most extensive area of large stabilized dunes yet reported in the North American Arctic; the landscape is of particular interest because it has been proposed as a first-order analog for martian fretted terrain. Recognition of the large dunes permits a new interpretation for linear and curvilinear trends visible in Landsat summer imagery.

Neon and argon are present in ""solar"" proportions; xenon appears to be dominated by contributions from ""planetary"" sources. The apparent xenon concentration is higher than that measured in any bulk meteorite, approaching the concentration found in the noble gas-rich, acid-insoluble residues from carbonaceous chondrites."
https://openalex.org/W2066681162,"Refraction of sunlight at the angle of minimum deviation between octahedral faces of crystals of ice Ic in the upper atmosphere could produce a halo around the sun or the moon at 27.46 degrees . Crystals of hexagonal ice having low-index faces cannot produce a halo of this radius. It is therefore suggested that Scheiner's halo, which has been reported at least four times since 1629 at 28 degrees from the sun, is due to ice Ic. If this is correct, it is apparently the first evidence that ice Ic occurs naturally and that liquid water can freeze to ice Ic."

https://openalex.org/W2005615610,"Following the discovery of the 11-year solar cycle signal in earth rotation, linear techniques were employed to investigate the amplitude and phase of the difference between ephemeris time and universal time (ΔT) as a function of time. The amplitude is nonstationary. This difference was related to Δ(LOD), the difference between the length of day and its nominal value. The 11-year term in Δ(LOD) was 0.8 millisecond at the close of the 18th century and decreased below noise level from 1840 to 1860. From 1875 to 1925, Δ(LOD) was about 0.16 millisecond, and it decreased to about 0.08 millisecond by the 1950's. Except for anomalous behavior from 1797 to 1838, ΔT lags sunspot numbers by 3.0 ± 0.4 years. Since ΔT lags Δ(LOD) by 2.7 years, the result is that Δ(LOD) is approximately in phase with sunspot numbers."

https://openalex.org/W1979896415,"In four dogs, the diarrhea, increased salivation and mucous membrane lesions characteristic of blacktongue were relieved within 24 hours following the administration of 150 mgs nicotinic amide, whereas the lacrimation, photophobia and extreme injection of the eye vessels did not diminish. These severe eye lesions regressed greatly 24 hours after the injection of 50 mgs of riboflavin, and in 72 hours had disappeared. The simultaneous occurrence of nicotinic acid and riboflavin deficiency in four dogs is evidence that such deficiencies occur as mixed diseases rather than as single entities. These findings are further evidence of the universality of nutritional deficiencies, since they suggest that deficiency diseases among the pets of families with deficiency diseases are not uncommon. In at least one instance the finding of nutritional deficiencies in a dog eating scraps from the family table led to a better understanding of the ill health of the family, none of whom had diagnostic lesions of deficiency disease at the time, although they all complained of weakness, nervousness, irritability and loss of appetite-the vague and ill-defined symptoms characteristic of deficiency diseases in the early stages."

https://openalex.org/W2051968408,"The science of the solid state has joined nuclear science and molecular biology as a field of major importance in the latter half of the 20th century. It took particular shape during the genesis of solid-state electronics and the post-transistor era of integrated circuits for telecommunications, computers, and digital signal machines. However, these developments were soon joined by techniques from the ancient fields of metallurgy and ceramics and contributions from the more current fields of synthetic polymers, rubbers, plastics, and modified bioorganic substances. This vast realm was characterized by a National Academy of Sciences study of the 1970's as ""materials science and engineering."" The public, as well as the scientific and engineering community, are currently concerned about the uses of research and development and the applications of knowledge for national progress. Consideration is given here to how well we are using the science of materials for industrial strength and such governmental objectives as national security and energy economy."
