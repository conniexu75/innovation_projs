The inverse rate ratios and activity curves of these two interconnected populations are compatible with reciprocal interaction as a physiological basis of sleep cycle oscillation."

https://openalex.org/W1997302126,"Analgesia resulting from focal electrical stimulation of the brain of the rat shows tolerance with repeated exposures; this tolerance dissipates after a period of nonstimulation. Addiction to morphine reduces greatly the analgesia produced by electrical stimulation of the brain, which demonstrates cross-tolerance between morphine analgesia and stimulation-produced analgesia. Recovery of the stimulation-produced analgesia is seen after discontinuing administration of morphine. These results suggest that morphine and electrical stimulation produce analgesia by common mechanisms. The fact that tolerance occurs to the analgesic effect of electrical stimulation indicates that tolerance may be an alteration of an endogenous neuronal process."
https://openalex.org/W1506420820,"In the preceding paper the preparation and characterization of antiserum to purified D-lactate are described. In this paper the effects of the antibody on D-lactate dehydrogenase activity and D-lactate-dependent active transport in native Escherichia coli ML 308-225 membrane vesicles and ML 308-225dld-3 vesicles reconstituted with D-lactate dehydrogenase are described. The results demonstrate that D-lactate dehydrogenase is inaccessible to antibody in native ML 308-225 vesicles, but readily accessible to antibody in reconstituted dld-3 vesicles. The findings indicate that D-lactate dehydrogenase is located on the inner surface of native ML 308-225 vesicles and on the outer surface of reconstituted dld-3 vesicles. The results with the native vesicle preparations also provide further evidence that virtually none of the vesicles is inverted or sufficiently damaged to allow access of antibody to D-lactate dehydrogenase. In addition, experiments are presented which demonstrate that an impermeable electron carrier, reduced 5-N-methylphenazonium-3-sulfonate, drives active transport in native ML 308-225 vesicles as well as its permeable analogue reduced phenazine methosulfate. Thus, reduction of the respiratory chain from either side of the vesicle membrane is able to drive active transport. Ca2+, Mg2+-stimulated ATPase is also inaccessible to antibody in ML 308-225 vesicles unless the preparation is subjected to ultrasonic sound, incubated in Tris buffer at pH 9.0, or homogenized vigorously. Moreover, as opposed to D-lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome b1, ATPase is readily lost from the membrane during the preparation of vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1496831544,"The DNA polymerase induced after infection of Escherichia coli by phage T7 has been purified 500-fold to near homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The purified enzyme complements extracts of cells infected with a T7 gene 5 mutant to permit cell-free replication of duplex T7 DNA. In contrast, purified T4 DNA polymerase or E. coli DNA polymerase I is unable to do so, thus suggesting a specific requirement for the T7 enzyme in the replication of the viral DNA. E. coli TsnC protein is present in purified T7 DNA polymerase in one-to-one stoichiometry with T7 gene 5 protein, and can be isolated in homogeneous form from heat-denatured enzyme by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The inactive form of T7 gene 5 protein that accumulates in tsnC hosts has been partially purified. When partially purified gene 5 protein is mixed with purified TsnC protein, DNA polymerase activity is restored, and formation of a one-to-one complex between the two proteins occurs. These results indicate that the functional form ofT7 DNA polymerase is a complex composed of phage- and host-specified subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1508811161,"The major coat protein of bacteriophage f1, which is localized in the host membrane during phage maturation, has a hydrophobic binding site capable of binding deoxycholate and a variety of detergents to form a soluble particle, and in that respect, resembles many membrane proteins. The soluble particle has properties that suggest it is formed by simple insertion of protein into a deoxycholate or detergent micelle, but molecular weight measurements show that the protein is present as a dimer, even in sodium dodecyl sulfate, indicating the existence of unusually strong forces for self-association. A by-product of the investigation has been to show that detergents can be very helpful in the fractionation of the constituent molecules of the virus: deoxycholate-solubilized virus is readily fractionated by gel chromatography into DNA, A protein, and B protein, with virtually no cross-contamination."

In vitro, extracts of tsnC mutant E. coli infected with T7 hage are incapable of replicating duplex T7 DNA, although extracts of wild type E. coli infected with T7 phage support replication of T7 DNA. In addition, extracts of the infected tsnC mutant are deficient in T7 DNA polymerase activity. Extracts prepared from uninfected E.coli tsnC-+ cells restore the ability of the infected tsnC extracts to replicate duplex T7 DNA, and also restore normal levels of the phage DNA polymerase activity. A 12,000-dalton heat-stable protein responsible for this complementation has been purified to near homogeneity from uninfected tsnC+ extracts and it is designated TsnC protein."

https://openalex.org/W1532945196,"Membrane-associated sialytransferase complexes from Escherichia coli K-235 catalyze the incorporation of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc) from cytidine 5-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuNAc) into polymeric products and a lipid fraction. Reconstitution of enzyme activity in lipid-depleted membrane complexes had an absolute dependence on a purified phospholipid which was characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry following dephosphorylation as undecaprenol. An identical mass spectrum was obtained on the phosphorylated lipid confirming that the active derivative was undecaprenyl phosphate. This C55-isoprenoid alcohol accounted for 95% of the polyisoprenol and contained 11 isoprene units, each one unsaturated. The remaining 5% was composed of the C60 homologue, dodecaprenol. Ficarprenyl phosphate, an isomer of undecaprenyl phosphate, also restored enzymatic activity although on a molar basis, it was less active than undecaprenyl phosphate. These results provide direct evidence that sialyl polymer synthesis has an obligatory requirement for undecaprenyl phosphate, a membrane-bound lipid coenzyme which functions as an intermediate carrier of glycosyl residues in the biosynthesis of a variety of microbial cell surface polysaccharides. These data extend further the general class of polysaccharides whose synthesis involves undecaprenyl phosphate and are in accord with the hypothesis that this lipid acts as an intermediate carrier of sialyl residues in sialyl polymer synthesis according to the following reaction: CMP-NeuNAc plus P-undecaprenol in equilibrium NeuNAc-P-undecaprenol plus CMP Although the sialylated lipid remains to be characterized, evidence in support of this conclusion was obtained by kinetic analysis of N-acetylneuraminic acid transfer into the lipid soluble fraction and sialyl polymers. These studies showed a rapid incorporation of N-acetylneuraminic acid into the lipid-soluble fraction prior to maximal sialyl polymer formation, an observation consistent with a possible precursortion, an observation consistent with a possible precursor-product relationship. Confirmation that the radioactivity in the lipid-soluble fraction was lipid-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid was provided by the demonstration of the formation of a transitory sialyl-lipid with chromatographic properties expected of sialyl-undecaprenyl phosphate. Three additional lines of investigation implicated a functional role for undecaprenyl phosphate in sialyl polymer synthesis..."
https://openalex.org/W109000003,"RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro from a lambda DNA template with purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase either in the presence or absence of the protein termination factor, rho. The products were initially characterized by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide slab gels, and two of the lower molecular weight discrete species (6 S and 4 S RNA) were further characterized by standard two-dimensional fingerprint analysis. Production of the 4 S RNA was strongly affected by the presence of rho, whereas production of the 6 S RNA species was relatively unaffected by rho. 3'-Terminal oligonucleotide fragments were then selectively isolated on columns of dihydroxyboryl-substituted cellulose from these transcripts. Sequence analysis of these oligonucleotide products indicated: (a) that all of the transcripts examined possess similar degrees of 3'-terminal sequence heterogeneity which consisted predominantly of the addition of 1 to 5 adenylate residues to the 3'-terminus of the transcript; and (b) that rho factor-enhanced termination results in a definite structural change in the nucleotide sequence with which an RNA molecule can terminate."
https://openalex.org/W1552257329,"Abstract Rabbit reticulocyte initiation factor M2A has been prepared in homogeneous form. The final preparation was purified 2,300-fold and ran as a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in three different buffer systems: alkaline, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and acidic 6.5 M urea. IF-M2A also ran as a single band in polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing experiments with an apparent pI of 6.45. The molecular weight of IF-M2A was approximately 125,000 based on determinations by low speed equilibrium centrifugation (118,000), sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (130,000) and s20,w combined with Stokes radius (124,000). The amino acid composition of IF-M2A revealed three unusual features: a) the basic amino acids represented 19.4 mol %; b) glutamicacid (plus glutamine) constituted 18.8 mol%; c) tryptophan and cysteine residues were only 0.4 and 0.7 mol%, respectively. Homogeneous IF-M2A was tested in several initiation assays using either natural or artificial mRNAs. In each assay tested, homogeneous IF-M2A fully substituted for cruder preparations and at concentrations commensurate with its increased purity. IF-M2A was also examined for ribosome-dependent GTP hydrolysis, an assay requiring ribosomes but no other initiation factors. Analysis of the data yielded a Km for GTP of 10 muM and a Vmax for hydrolysis of 1.20pmol/mug IF-M2A/min. In addition, IF-M2A mediated GTP hydrolysis required both 40 S and 60 S subunits for maximal activity. The possibility that IF-M2A is a factor required for the joining of 40 S and 60 S subunits is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1645103127,"Escherichia coli Ile-tRNA synthetase and tRNA-Ile have been cross-linked photochemically by the direct action of ultraviolet light. In addition, photo-induced joining of tRNA-Ile E. coli to Val-tRNA synthetase from yeast has also been achieved. This yeast enzyme is known to mischarge E. coli tRNA-Ile with valine. Regions on tRNA-Ile involved in cross-linking have been determined for both complexes. In each case, three distinct parts of the nucleic acid are found cross-linked. Two of these are the same in both complexes and involve the dihydrouridine stem and loop region. The third part is unique for each complex. It involves the 3' terminus in the cognate one and the 3' side of the anticodon in the non-cognate case. When the cross-linked regions are projected onto a model of the three-dimensional structure of tRNA, it is clear that these and other data are consistent with having each enzyme bound in a similar orientation across tRNA-Ile. The enzymes are viewed as spanning the distance from the anticodon to the 3' terminus and making extensive contact with the area in which the two helical branches of the L-shape tRNA structure come together."
https://openalex.org/W1590996315,"Cultures of escherichia coli growing exponentially in Trisacetate medium were subjected to nutritional shift-up and the pool size of guanosine 5'-3'-diphosphate-3'diphosphate (ppGpp) as well as the rates of protein synthesis and net RNA synthesis were determined. In the shift to a rich medium (glucose plus 19 amino acids plus hypoxanthine) the basal level of ppGpp falls immediately with a decay constant suggesting total inhibition of synthesis; ther is no ppGpp detectable above background for 30 to 40 min. The net rate of RNA synthesis starts to increase within 1 min of the shift-up and has reached its definite postshift value well before the pool of ppGGpp rises above background lvel. In a shift-up from Tris-acetate medium to Tris-glucose medium there is a much slower readjustment of the ppGpp pool size without the transient disappearance of the nucleotide. However, in a shift-up to Tris-acetate plus 5 amino acids, a medium which supports the same growth rate as Tris-glucose medium, a dramatic, transient drop in the ppGpp pool level was observed. Relaxed cells exhibit very similar behavior to strigent cells in the same shift-up. Our data argue strongly against an exclusive role for pGpp in regulating RNA synthesis during niutritional shift-up. The kinetic data of [3H]guanosine uptake into GTP and ppGpp pools were analyzed to determine the rate of pGpp synthesis. This rate was found to be similar during expotential growth in either Tris-acetate medium. During a shift-down from Tris-glucose to Tris-acetate medium the rate of ppGpp syntesis fell by a factor of 1.5 to 2 and the turnover rate is reduced 6- to 8-fold, suggesting that the expansion in the ppGp pool during shift-down canot be due to derepression of synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1519694123,"The T7 gene 4 protein, a protein known from genetic analysis to participate in phage DNA replication in vivo, has been purified approximately 500-fold with an in vitro complementation assay. The protein, purified from cells infected with a T7 gene 4 temperature-sensitive mutant, is thermolabile, establishing that the complementation activity is in the protein product of the phage gene 4. The purified protein has no detectable nuclease, DNA polymerase, or RNA polymerase activity. However, in addition to stimulating the rate of DNA replication in crude extracts of T7 gene 4 mutant-infected cells, the gene 4 protein effects a marked stimulation of DNA synthesis by the purified T7 DNA polymerase when duplex T7 DNA is used as template. This effect is not observed when denatured T7 DNA is used as template, or when phage T4 DNA polymerase or Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, II, OR III is substituted for the T4 enzyme. Analysis of the DNA synthesized by the T7 DNA polymerase in the presence of the gene 4 protein indicates that much of the product is in short DNA chains which are not covalently attached to the template. This result suggests a novel mechanism for the initiation of DNA chains in this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1568412588,"The multiple active transport systems mediating L-leucine accumulation in Escherichia coli strain 7 (K12) and ML 308-225 have been examined. In addition to the previously characterized osmotic shock-sensitive LS (L-leucine-specific) and LIV-I (L-leucine; L-isoleucine-, and L-valine-specific) activities, a third system (designated LIV-II) has been detected, confirming a report by Rahmanian et al. (RAHMANIAN, M., CLAUS, D.R., and OXENDER, D. L. (1973) J. Bacteriol. 116, 1258-1266). This third system transports L-leucine, L-isoleucine, and L-valine with a relatively low affinity (apparent transport Km equals 4 muM for L-leucine) and it is resistant to repression by cell growth on L-leucine. Exploitation of these properties and of the differential sensitivity of the three transport activities to inhibition by L-leucine analogues permits estimation of the contribution by each system to the total transport activity under varying conditions. Such experiments show that, unlike systems LS and LIV-I, system LIV-II is resistant to osmotic shock. The L-leucine, L-iosleucine, and L-valine transport activity in membrane vesicles from strain ML 308-225 has the properties of system LIV-II. Although the L-leucine transport activities in strains 7 and ML 308-225 are in all other respects similar, membrane vesicles from strain 7 do not transport L-leucine, L-isoleucine, or L-valine. L-leucine transport under various conditions of energy supply has been measured in strain ML 308-225 and the corresponding Mg-2+-ATP-ASE-DEFICIENT STRAIN, DL-54. These measurements support the view that the osmotic shock-sensitive LS and LIV-I activities depend on the synthesis of ATP, while the osmotic shock-resistant LIV-II activity depends on the energized membrane state generated by electron flow but not on ATP synthesis, per se. This conclusion is not supported by the inhibitory effects of the energy poisons arsenate and 2,4-dinitrophenol, but these compounds may have secondary chemical effects on the transport systems."

https://openalex.org/W1585828643,"Naturally occurring oligoglutamate derivatives of folic acid in extracts of Escherichia coli have been isolated on the basis of their inhibitory actions toward thymidylate synthetase and dihydrofolate reductase. The inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase has been identified as N-5-formyl-H4pteroyloligoglutamate (approximately 5 amino acid residues). It is 150-fold more inhibitory than the monoglutamate. Synthetic N-5-formyl derivatives containing 3 to 6 glutamyl residues were prepared and found to be 67- to 200-fold more inhibitory than the monoglutamate. N-5-Formimino-H4pteroyltriglutamate is one-twentieth as inhibitory as the corresponding N-5-formyl derivative. The inhibitor of mouse leukemia dihydrofolate reductase has been identified as N-10-formylpteropentaglutamate. It is approximately 7 times as inhibitory as N-10-formylpteroylmonoglutamate. It is 4,400 times as inhibitory toward mouse leukemia dihydrofolate reductase compared with the enzyme from E. coli. Lysine analogs of N-5-formyl-H4folate containing alpha0glutamyl groups in peptide linkage to the epsilon-amino group of lysine were relatively poor inhibitors of thymidylate synthetase. The inhibitory action of folic acid oligoglutamates on E. coli thymidylate synthetase was subject to reversal with 0.4 M NaCl, an effect that was more marked with various pteroyloligoglutamates than with H4homopteroylmonoglutamate and N-5, N-8-deaza-N-10-methylpteroylmonoglutamate."

https://openalex.org/W1603401661,"Equilibrium and covalent binding studies of succinic thiokinase from Escherichia coli indicates that there can be a stoichiometric relationship between coenzyme A binding and the phosphoyrlation capacity of the enzyme. A comparison of homogeneous enzyme preparations has revealed that enzyme of high specific activity exhibits greater binding capacity and that this property is proportional to enzyme activity. Phosphorylation capacity was related to specific activity in highly active enzyme preparations, but leveled off at 1 mol of phosphorus/mol of thiokinase. These studies show that the dimer of dimers structure of succinic thiokinase contains the expected two active sites and that this enzyme does not demonstrate half-the-sites reactivity. A coenzyme A binding site of lower affinity can be detected in some enzyme samples of lower specific activity. Binding of coenzyme A to the higher affinity sites may involve positive cooperativity. ATP, unlike ADP, does not bind to phosphorylated enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1493310889,"Membrane-associated sialyltransferase complexes in Escherichia coli K-235 can be dissociated by lipid deletion and reassembled by the addition of undecaprenyl phosphate, a unique membrane-bound lipid coenzyme. Following disruption of the cells by pressure disintegration and centrifugal fractionation, the sialyltransferase activity is assocatied with both a and complex. Kinetic studies as well as sugar nucleotide, metal ion, pH, ammonium sulfate, and thiol reagent requirements showed these two complexes contained functionally identical enzymatic activities. Isopycnic sucrose density gradient centrifugation studies carried out on unfractionated total membranes established that these sialytransferase activities were associated with membrane hybrids composed of different relative amounts of inner and outer membranes. Enzyme localization studies employing DPNH oxidase, a marker for the inner membrane, and relative phospholipid to protein composition determinations in the two complexes, provided added support for this conclusion. Sialyl polymer synthesis was not dependent on the incorporation of other monosaccharides and had no demonstrable metal ion requirement. Kinetic studies showed that the Km for cytidine 5-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid in intact soluble and particulate enzyme preparations was 8.1 times 10-5M and 9.2 times 105M, respectively. Similarly, both enzyme complexes had nearly identical Vmax values. Following reassembly of delipidated enzyme preparations, however, there was a 10-fold increase in the Km value for the particulate enzyme and a 3-fold increase for the soluble enzyme. This increase was accompanied by an increase of approximately the same magnitude in the Vmax values. Since the lipid coenzyme was limiting in intact enzyme preparations, the increase in Vmax reflected an increase in the concentration of the active lipid in reconstituted complexes. Sialyl polymer synthesis in intact membrane preparations was stimulated by the exogenous addition of lipid. Insertion of the carrier lipid was dependent on temperature. At 37 degrees, a 120% increase in sialytransferase activity was observed while only a 35% increase was observed at 30 percent. At 20 degrees, no stimulation occurred. Fluidity of the lipid phase is apparently required for proper function of this membraneassociated enzyme complex. Thus, at 20 degrees, a temperature below the membrane lipid transition temperature, the lipids are relatively immobile."

https://openalex.org/W2017855232,"THE hypophysiotropic luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) has a number of distinct actions on the anterior pituitary gland. In addition to stimulating the release and increased synthesis of gonadotrophins1, this peptide also has a priming or self-potentiating effect so that intermittent stimulation of the pituitary with identical doses of LHRH causes a progressively increasing series of responses of luteinising-hormone (LH) secretion. Self-potentiation by LHRH has been observed in vivo in rats2 and man3 and may play an important role in the generation of the LH surge which precedes ovulation. The effect can be obtained4 following repeated, brief exposures of the isolated, perifused rat pituitary gland to LHRH and the time course of development and decay of the potentiated state in these conditions is similar to that observed in the intact rat2. We have investigated the effects of an inhibitor of protein synthesis on this phenomenon and report here that cycloheximide suppresses the priming effect of LHRH without impairing the acute response of LH release."
https://openalex.org/W2026757928,"Under the balanced condition of growth of E. coli cells, no distinct difference is observed in stable RNA and protein synthesis between CP78 (rel+) and CP79 (rel minus), whereas a considerable difference is present in RNA accumulation between NF161 (rel+) and NF162 (rel minus), where NF161 smaller than NF162. The RNA content of NF161 is lower than that of NF162 in four different cultures with different growth rates. These two sets of isogenic pairs of rel+ and rel minus strains are commonly used in the study of rel gene function; however, NF161 is a mutant in the spoT gene whose product may be responsible for the degradation of ppGpp. The basal levels of ppGpp in these four strains growing with three different growth rates were examined: NF161 (rel+ spoT minus) has a much higher content of ppGpp than do other strains. Furthermore, the contents of ppGpp tend to be lower when the above four strains are growing at a faster rate. Thus a close correlation seems to exist between the content of RNA and the basal level of ppGpp under the condition of balanced growth."

The substrate ATP is required for reconstitution of activity, but the presence of our substrates does not appear to influence the renaturation process.

The method is useful for accurately determining the very small equilibrium constants (KP) which characterize the dissociation of cofactor from many pyridoxal-P-requiring enzymes. The analysis also establishes the minimum number and relative stabilities of distinct enzymic species involved in the resolution process. Analysis of the resolution of D-serine dehydratase by L-and D-cysteine resulted in the establishment of an enzyme bound thiazolidine derivative as an intermediate in the pathway for resolution. The over-all equilibrium constant (KR) for the reaction, D-serine dehydratase + cystein in equilibrium KR thiazolidine derivative +D-serine apodehydratase was determined. At pH 7.80, T/2 0.33, 25 degrees, KR equal to 1.08 times 10-minus 3. A value of 7.0 nM for the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of D-serine dehydratase to apoenzyme and free pyridoxal-P was determined from the ratio KR/KT, where KT is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a thiazolidine derivative from free pyridoxal-P and cysteine. An estimate of 14 nM for KP was also obtained from partial resolution of D-serine dehydratase by high dilution. The difficulties associated with this direct determination of KP from the dependence on the enzyme concentration of the activity of very dilute solutions of enzyme are discussed."

The T1 and pancreatic ribonuclease digestion products were partially analyzed and the results were compared with nucleotide sequences from T4 species I RNA to obtain a minimum estimate of the number of nucleotide sequence differences among the three species I RNAs. Analysis of fragments obtained by digestion with epsilon-carboxymethyl-lysine-41-pancreatic ribonuclease and with E. coli Q13 S30 crude extract was also performed to provide some additional confirmation for the nucleotide sequences that were derived for the T2 and T6 species I RNAs. T2 species I RNA was found to be different at three positions in the nucleotide sequence, and unlike T4 species I RNA, contained in addition the modified nucleotide, psi, in a region where the proposed secondary structure is identical to the TpsiC-loop of a tRNA. T6 species I RNA was found to contain nucleotide differences from the T4 species I RNA sequence at four positions. The U at position 119 in the sequence appears to be modified to psi only to a small extent. While a biological function for species I RNA is unknown, the fact that there is over 97% homology in the sequences suggests strong evolutionary pressures to retain the nucleotide sequence in the T-even genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1518840231,"Abstract The transport of alpha-methylglucoside and a variety of amino acids including histidine, leucine, lysine, proline, and threonine are reduced 5- to 50-fold in Escherichia coli K1061, an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph, when cells are grown in medium containing glucose as a carbon source and supplemented with either cis-vaccenic acid or cis-9, 10-methylenehexadecanoic acid. Cells grown in glucose medium containing oleate, palmitoleate, or cis-7-hexadecenoate do not exhibit this effect and transport alpha-methylglucoside and amino acids at rates comparable to those of a wild type strain. For cis-vaccenate- and cis-9, 10-methylenehexadecanoate-grown cells the capacity to transport amino acids and alpha-methylglucoside is normal when glycerol or succinate is the energy supply or when cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate is added to cultures growing on glucose. These results suggest that in this strain several transport systems are affected by catabolite repression, but the phenomenon is unique since repression requires not only glucose but specific unsaturated fatty acids, cis-vaccenic acid, or cis-9, 20-methylenehexadecanoic acid."

Further centrifugation studies showed that the enzyme could be completely dissociated to species of 30,000 molecular weight. Peptide maps of tryptic hydrolysates of denatured and chemically modified enzyme showed that the protein is composed of four identical or nearly identical sub-units.

Mapping experiments indicate that the lesion is located at a site within 10 to 15% of the end of this gene. The mutation results in out-of-phase translation of the distal portion of the trp mRNA; normal translational termination signal(s) are not encountered and a trpA gene product longer than the wild type protein is produced. As with the other enzymes produced from this operon, the in vivo level of the altered protein (the alpha subunit of the tryptophan synthetase enzyme complex) is controlled by exogenous L-tryptophan. The altered alpha subunit from the strain ICR-47 has been isolated and characterized. Molecular weight estimations indicate a molecular weight of approximately 37,000, an increase beyond the wild type enzyme corresponding to an additional 50 to 70 amino acid residues. The protein has a new COOH-terminal amino acid sequence. Results of preliminary hybridization experiments suggest that the ICR-47 mRNA, which is necessarily longer than that needed to code for wild type enzyme, is not detectably different in size from wild type mRNA. The enzymatic properties of the ICR-47 alpha subunit indicates a greatly reduced ability of the mutant subunit to combine functionally with wild type beta2 subunit, the second protein component in the tryptophan synthetase enzyme complex. In contrast, only 40 to 50% of the intrinsic enzymatic activity of the alpha subunit is lost."
