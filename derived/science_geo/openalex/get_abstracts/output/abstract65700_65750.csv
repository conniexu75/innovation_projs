https://openalex.org/W2016487214,"A variety of antiparkinsonian drugs are potent, noncompetitive inhibitors of dopamine uptake into synaptosomes in homogenates of rat corpus striatum. Inhibition of dopamine uptake may potentiate the synaptic actions of dopamine in the striatum and could explain the antiparkinsonian effects of these drugs. This hypothesis accounts for several clinical features of Parkinson's disease and predicts compounds which may be new therapeutic agents."

https://openalex.org/W2040185588,"Alpha-naphthoflavone inhibits the metabolism of 3,4-benzopyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene in hamster enlbryo cell cultures and protects the cells against the inhibition of cell multiplication by these carcinogens. Alphla-nalphthoflavone also inhibits the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in homogenates of induced hamster embryo cells and in liver microsomes from rats previously treated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but not in microsomes from control rats."
https://openalex.org/W1583842568,"Abstract Carbamyl phosphate synthetase, present in the soluble supernatant fraction of homogenate of hematopoietic mouse spleen, has been purified about 90-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by chromatography on hydroxylapatite. Buffers used contain 30% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide and 5% (w/v) glycerol, as well as 1 mm dithiothreitol, as enzyme stabilizers. The enzyme inactivation is minimal under these conditions as far as tested. The loss of activity during 24 hours at 0° is about 7% under these conditions. When the enzyme is frozen at -79°, the loss is less than 1% per day. In buffered aqueous solutions containing no specific stabilizers, the enzyme is extremely unstable so that, in 0.25 m sucrose at pH 7, the half-time of enzyme inactivation at 0° is about 20 min. Enzyme activity was routinely assayed with bicarbonate-14C as a substrate by following the radioactivity incorporated into citrulline in the presence of l-ornithine and ornithine transcarbamylase purified from bovine or frog liver. The reaction requires enzyme, magnesium, adenosine triphosphate, and l-glutamine, in addition to ornithine and ornithine transcarbamylase. Ammonia can, at least partially, replace glutamine as nitrogen donor. In a system devoid of ornithine transcarbamylase, accumulation of carbamyl phosphate takes place. ATP is not replaced by other ribonucleoside triphosphates or deoxyadenosine triphosphate. The role of glutamine as a direct source of carbamyl nitrogen is indicated by the stoichiometric conversion of glutamine-14C into glutamic acid-14C that accompanies citrulline synthesis. Results of studies with 32P-labeled ATP are consistent with the consumption of 2 moles of ATP per mole of citrulline formed. The wide distribution of this or a similar type of carbamyl phosphate synthetase activity among various mammalian tissues is demonstrated. Relatively high activities are found in soluble fractions of tissues which are supposed to have a rapid rate of cellular proliferation, such as gastrointestinal tracts, spleen, thymus, and testis. All these activities in nonhepatic tissues are not affected by N-acetyl-l-glutamate."

Kittens exposed to a trial and error condition never acquired the response. Initial differences in attentiveness to demonstrator performances disappeared by the second day. ""Altruism"" (food sharing) and other forms of social behavior were exhibited by both mother and stranger demonstrators."

https://openalex.org/W2019956482,"The chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate is metabolized by the intestinal flora of normal mice. This metabolism is reduced either by treatment of mice with the antibiotics neomycin and sulfathiazole, or in germ-free mice. In addition to affecting metabolism, these antibiotics alter physiological distribution of methotrexate so that excretion by the intestinal route is significantly enhanced."
https://openalex.org/W2066143024,"The Golgi apparatus of a marine chrysophycean alga Pleurochrysis scherffelii Pringsheim produces wall fragments (circular-to-ellipsoidal ""scales"") which are released to the periphery by an exocytotic process involving the fusion of cisternae and the plasma membrane. The cellulosic component of the scales is a complex network of fibrils (10 to 25 angstroms in diameter) that resist treatment with strong alkali. Untreated washed scales yield galactose, ribose, arabinose, and traces of glucose; alkali-purified scales yield much more glucose. The fibrillar scale constituent shows a positive iodine dichroism of the intact wall, a positive zinc chloride-iodine reaction, breakage sites characteristic of highly crystalline cellulose, and solubility in Schweizer's reagent."

https://openalex.org/W2068230450,"Antibody formation against sheep erythrocytes by mouse spleen cells in vitro requires interactions among antigen-treated macrophages and lymphoid cells in cell culsters for only a finite time. During this critical period of interaction, lymphoid cells become ""activated"" and thereafter can develop into antibody-producing cells independently of native antigen, macrophages, and cell clusters."

https://openalex.org/W2066280758,It is necessary to agree on the nature and size of the interaction between population and economic phenomena at stages of national development before it can be decided what is effective and appropriate under the circumstances. The neo-Malthusian world model claims that development is impeded when the rate of population growth is high as a result of mortality reductions caused by western technology. The humane version of the model would slowly reduce mortality commensurate with reduced fertility and raise the formation of capital. The assumption is that high levels of productivity could be achieved if consumption mortality and fertility are at intermediate levels. An alternative model assumes that improvements in the standard of living and decreases in mortality and fertility rates are linked in a concurrent circular and cumulative process. A reduction in mortality may make people want smaller families. High fertility has been an accomodation to high mortality. The alternative model emphasizes improvements in health productivity and longevity. The neo-Malthusian model assumes that levels of mortality are independent of levels of living; it ignores dependence of fertility trends on mortality trends. The alternative model assumes that reduced mortality will increase the need and desire for family planning. Successful development results in and from a balance between mortality and fertility at the lowest mortality rate attainable with the available resources.

https://openalex.org/W2082757697,"Rats were provided with opportunity to turn reinforcing hypothalamic stimulation on and off by traversing back and forth across a chamber. When provided with edible and inedible objects, all animals that self-stimulated carried them from the stimulation to the nonstimulation side. Neither food deprivation nor a history of stimulus-bound eating produced a preference for the edible objects. Equivalent stimulation provided without regard to the animals' location in the chamber did not elicit object-carrying. Results are interpreted in terms of the natural conditions which normally elicit this species-specific unit of behavior. Implications for understanding other behavior patterns elicited by hypothalamic stimulation are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1674185221,"Abstract Wheat germ acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase has been purified over 1000-fold. Ultracentrifugal analysis showed two protein components (7.3 S and 9.4 S); only one of these binds avidin, as evidenced by an increase in the sedimentation coefficient of the 9.4 S component to 11.5 S. However, only one protein peak was observed upon chromatography on molecular sieving columns. The leading edge of this protein showed the highest specific activity, contained the highest amount of biotin per mg of protein, and was the major site for ATP-32Pi exchange (avidin-sensitive), whereas the trailing edge of the protein peak was found to be specific for the binding of the 3H-acetyl moiety of 3H-acetyl-CoA and catalyzed malonyl-CoA-14C-acetyl-CoA exchange. A synergistic effect was observed upon addition of fractions from the leading edge and the trailing edge of the protein peak. Disc gel electrophoresis established that five components are associated with the single protein peak obtained from molecular sieve columns. Two of the five bands catalyzed ATP-32Pi exchange, two bands catalyzed malonyl-CoA-14C-acetyl-CoA exchange, and the fifth band catalyzed both exchange reactions as well as H14CO3- fixation. Biotin content, molecular weights, and the activities of the five individual bands suggest that one protein occurs as either a monomer or a dimer which contains biotin and catalyzes ATP-32Pi exchange, and that another protein occurs as both a monomer and a tetramer which do not contain biotin but catalyze malonyl-CoA-14C-acetyl-CoA exchange and bind acetyl moieties to the protein. The fifth band appears to be the active enzyme consisting of one carboxylating component (9.4 S) and one or more transcarboxylating components (7.3 S)."

https://openalex.org/W2037222744,The enzyme D(—)-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase has been reported to occur in all mitochondria isolated from mammalian tissues and is especially high in liver. By contrast only a very low concentration of the enzyme is detectable in mitochondria from bovine and sheep liver. The amount of the enzyme in mitochondria from other ruminant tissues such as kidney and heart are comparable with those from mammalian sources. The very low activity of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is not referable to the inability of substrates to penetrate mitochondria or to decreased electron transfer activity but rather to a lack of the enzyme in ruminant liver mitochondria.

https://openalex.org/W2006055245,"Microparticulates suspended in lake water were collected by continuous centrifugation and either examined directly or placed on a linear sucrose gradient. Total residue as well as fractions of the centrifuged gradient were extracted with hexane and examined by gas chromatography for the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides. Hexane extracts of total residues were also examined by thin-layer chromatography. Lindane and endrin were shown, by gas-liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography, to be associated with microparticles. These and other pesticides appeared to be selectively associated with microparticles of different densities, when gas-liquid chromatography was used, although concentrations were below the detection limits required for confirmation by thin-layer chromatography. Samples taken at different times from different locations in Lake Erie revealed different associations with hexane-soluble electron-capturing compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1625574873,"The mechanism of alkali resistance in hemoglobin Rainier, an adult human hemoglobin variant (beta 145 tyrosinie --> histidinie), has been investigated. Alkali denaturation kinetics, electrophoretic and hybridization study. and ultracentrifuge analysis provided evidence for a monomeric beta Rainiier chain resisting denaturation at alkaline pH. These data provide evidence for a previously unrecognized effect of a single amino acid substitution, that is, the change of the alkali denaturation properties of monomneric chains."

https://openalex.org/W2059532681,"AUXOTROPHIC mutants of bacteria with various metabolic blocks have proved useful for the elucidation of intermediary steps in biosynthetic pathways1. Until recently this approach has not been applied to the biosynthesis of K vitamins (menaquinones), chiefly because of the lack of adequate vitamin K-deficient mutants2 which would accumulate significant intermediary metabolites. We have isolated some menaphthone-requiring, small-colony mutants of Staphylococcus aureus by selection with neomycin3 and found that they grow and respire normally on media supplemented with menadione. This could be attributed to bridging of the main electron transport chain by menadione, which is known to be capable of by-passing flavin, vitamin K2 and cytochrome b (ref. 4). If so, the mutants stimulated by menadione might equally represent flavin-deficient, vitamin K-deficient, or cytochrome 6-deficient mutants. Alternatively, if menadione is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of K vitamins, these mutants may simply be of the vitamin K-deficient type. The biosynthesis of menaquinones up to chorismic acid follows the common pathway of aromatic amino-acids2, so that some of the vitamin K-deficient mutants stimulated by menadione might be stimulated by shikimic acid as well, provided that the latter can penetrate the bacterial Cell."
https://openalex.org/W1908156562,"The nature and relative amounts of the pyrimidine nucleotide sequences which occur in heteropolydeoxynucleotides synthesized with terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase have been determined for the limited class of products containing a single pyrimidine moiety and one or more purine types by the use of acid degradation followed by ion exchange chromatography. The results offer further proof that, in these products, the synthetic reaction is a true copolymerization and that no recognizable order in the sequences is present. The lengths and frequencies of sequences of repeated pyrimidine nucleotide residues in the various copolymers appear to be influenced by the identity of the purine nucleoside triphosphates present during the copolymerization, as well as to the stoichiometry of the reaction mixture."
https://openalex.org/W1968605857,"HAEMOGLOBIN Hiroshima is an abnormal form in which the histidines H21 (143)β are replaced by aspartates1. It has a much diminished Bohr effect and an increased oxygen affinity2, and causes mild erythremia in heterozygotes. This seemed puzzling at first, because histidine H21 is external and apparently inactive, but an explanation now suggests itself on the basis of the recently proposed mechanism of the Bohr effect3. A major part of this effect is caused by a conformational change at the C-terminus of the β-chains which accompanies the discharge of oxygen and causes the imidazole groups of histidines HC3 (146)β, which are free in oxyhaemoglobin, to be bound to the aspartates FG1 (94)β in deoxyhaemoglobin, thus raising their pKs. Examination of the atomic model of haemoglobin shows that replacement of histidines H21 (143)β by aspartates in haemoglobin Hiroshima would generate a pair of competing negative charges which would bind the imidazoles of histidines HC3 (146)β in both the oxy and the deoxy forms, thus keeping their pKs permanently high and inhibiting their contribution to the Bohr effect."
