We demonstrate here that 26 S and activated 20 S proteasomes from rabbit muscle degrade denatured, nonubiquitinated proteins in a highly processive fashion but generate different patterns of peptides (despite their containing identical proteolytic sites). With both enzymes, products range in length from 3 to 22 residues, and their abundance decreases with increasing length according to a log-normal distribution. Less than 15% of the products are the length of class I presented peptides (8 or 9 residues), and two-thirds are too short to function in antigen presentation. Surprisingly, these mammalian proteasomes, which contain two “chymotryptic,” two “tryptic,” and two “post-acidic” active sites, generate peptides with a similar size distribution as do archaeal 20 S proteasomes, which have 14 identical sites. Furthermore, inactivation of the “tryptic” sites altered the peptides produced without significantly affecting their size distribution. Therefore, this distribution is not determined by the number, specificity, or arrangement of the active sites (as proposed by the “molecular ruler” model); instead, we propose that proteolysis continues until products are small enough to diffuse out of the proteasomes.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the major proteolytic system in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, where it catalyzes the selective degradation of short lived regulatory proteins and the rapid elimination of proteins with abnormal conformation (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, this system also seems to be responsible for the breakdown of the bulk of cell proteins (3Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The critical protease in this pathway is the 26 S proteasome, an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex, which is formed by the association of the barrel-shaped 20 S proteasome (700-kDa) and two 19 S (700-kDa) regulatory complexes (5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar,6Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The 19 S complexes activate peptide hydrolysis within the 20 S proteasome (7Chu-Ping M. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are responsible for the recognition of ubiquitinated proteins (8Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It contains six different ATPases, which probably unfold protein substrates and facilitate their entry into the 20 S particle (9Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell.

Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 6Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Each of the outer two rings contains seven different α-subunits, which surround a narrow opening through which substrates appear to enter (12Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Each of the inner two rings is composed of seven different β-subunits, which enclose the central chamber where proteolysis occurs. On three of these β-subunits are found the active sites (13Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar), one of which is “chymotrypsin-like” in specificity, one of which is “trypsin-like,” and one that cleaves after acidic residues (14Orlowski M.

In vivo, 20 S proteasomes exist not only as a part of the 26 S complexes, but also as free particles (18Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear whether this free form ever functions in protein degradation in vivo. As part of the continuous turnover of cell proteins, the great majority of peptides generated by proteasomes must be rapidly degraded into amino acids by cytosolic peptidases. In mammalian cells, some of the proteasomal products escape complete degradation and are presented to the immune system on the cell surface in complexes with MHC 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride; Amc, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; Bis-tris propane, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; IGF, insulin-like growth factor 1; Suc, succinyl; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride; Amc, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; Bis-tris propane, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; IGF, insulin-like growth factor 1; Suc, succinyl; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. class I molecules (3Rock K.L.

These antigenic peptides are 8 or 9 residues long (21Rammensee H.G. Friede T. Stefanofic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Proteasomes are essential for the formation of the C terminus of most antigenic peptides but may not be required for the generation of their N termini (22Craiu A. Akopian T. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10850-10855Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, if proteasomes generate N-terminally extended versions of antigenic peptides, they can be trimmed by cytosolic peptidases to the presented epitopes (22Craiu A. Akopian T. Goldberg A.L.

Obviously, information on the sizes and nature of the products of protein breakdown by mammalian proteasomes is essential for a full understanding of both MHC class I antigen presentation and the postproteasomal steps in the complete degradation of proteins to amino acids. Homologous 20 S proteasomes are also found in archaea and certain eubacteria (5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 6Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that do not possess the ubiquitin system or 26 S complexes. In the archaeal particle, there is only one type of α-subunit and one type of β-subunit, and thus this 20 S particle contains 14 identical chymotrypsin-like active sites, which are positioned at equal distances around the β-rings (26Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Unlike traditional proteases, which release the substrate after each cleavage event, proteasomes from the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum degrade proteins in a highly processive fashion into small peptides and do not dissociate from the substrate between cleavage events (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this complex digests proteins according to a “molecular ruler” mechanism, in which the length of peptides produced would correspond to the distance between active sites (7 or 8 residues) (26Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 28Wenzel T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W.

Biol. 1995; 60: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, we have recently found that archaeal proteasomes generate products that range from 3 to 30 residues in length. The abundance of these peptides decreases as their size increases, and this relationship follows a log-normal distribution (30Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1982-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These findings on the archaeal proteasome cannot be automatically applied to their mammalian counterparts for several reasons. Eukaryotic proteasomes have fewer active sites (6 versus 14) (13Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar, 26Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). These sites are asymmetrically distributed in the eukaryotic particle (13Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic proteasomes have three different types of active sites, and therefore they cleave a much larger range of peptide bonds. The sensitivities of mammalian and archaeal proteasomes to inhibitors are different (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In fact, with oligopeptide substrates (11–44 residues), eukaryotic and archaeal proteasomes generate different products (31Niedermann G. Grimm R. Geier E. Maurer M. Realini C. Gartmann C. Soll J. Omura S. Rechsteiner M.C. Shabanowitz J. Baumeister W. Eichmann K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 209-220Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Leibovitz D. Koch Y. Fridkin M. Pitzer F. Zwickl P. Dantes A. Baumeister W. Amsterdam A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11029-11032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to analyze systematically the products of protein degradation by 26 S proteasomes from mammalian tissues. Most prior biochemical studies of proteasome activity have focused on 20 S particles because of the difficulties in purification of the 26 S complexes, their instability (5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 33Rivett A.J. Savory P.J. Djaballah H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the inability to obtain ubiquitinated proteins in amounts necessary for chemical studies. However, the physiological relevance of findings on the 20 S particles is uncertain. In fact, when isolated rapidly in the presence of glycerol, 20 S proteasomes exhibit little or no activity against protein substrates (5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 33Rivett A.J. Savory P.J. Djaballah H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These latent 20 S particles can be activated in vitro by a variety of treatments (e.g. by the addition of detergents, such as 0.02% SDS, or by removal of glycerol), but it is unclear if, after such treatments, the 20 S proteasomes function in the same way as when they are associated with 19 S regulatory complexes as part of the 26 S particle. Therefore, an important goal of this work was to compare the nature of the products generated by 26 S proteasomes and activated 20 S proteasomes during the degradation of full-length proteins. One potential complication in interpreting results of such studies is the heterogeneity of 26 and 20 S proteasome subunits in many mammalian tissues (5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). Therefore, rabbit skeletal muscle was chosen as the source of the proteasomes because of their homogeneous composition in this tissue (34Van Kaer L. Ashtonrickardt P.G. Eichelberger M. Gaczynska M. Nagashima K. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Doherty P.C. Tonegawa S. Immunity. 1994; 1: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). 2K. M. Woo, unpublished observations. 2K. M. Woo, unpublished observations. Unlike other tissues (e.g. liver), muscles express exclusively X, Y, and Z catalytic subunits and do not contain the γ-interferon-inducible homologs (i.e. the immunoproteasomes). In these studies, four proteins of different lengths (casein, lactalbumin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF), and ovalbumin) were used as substrates after denaturation, which appears to be necessary for proteins to traverse the narrow opening in the α-rings of the 20 S proteasomes (12Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The present studies of 26 S function were made possible by the finding that in the presence of ATP, such denatured proteins are also degraded by the 26 S particles. 20 and 26 S proteasomes were simultaneously purified to homogeneity from rabbit psoas muscle. After the muscles were minced to small pieces, they were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 msucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g to remove cell debris and then was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatants were spun for 6 h at 150,000 × g. The resulting proteasome-containing pellets were dissolved in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) and loaded onto a DEAE AffiBlue (Bio-Rad) column. After washing with 40 mmNaCl (in buffer A), proteasomes were eluted with buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl and directly loaded on an Uno Q-12 column (Bio-Rad). Fractions containing proteasomal activity were identified by their ability to hydrolyze Suc-LLVY-Amc. Complete separation of the 26 and 20 S proteasomes was achieved by a gradient of 0.15–0.45m NaCl in 200 ml (Fig. 1). The peak of the activity of 20 S proteasomes was stimulated by 0.02% SDS, while the 26 S activity was markedly inhibited by this concentration of SDS and by removal of ATP. Fractions containing 20 S proteasomes were dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, and finally purified by chromatography on a heparin-Sepharose HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 20 S proteasome was eluted by a 0–0.3 mgradient of KCl in 10 column volumes and stored at −70 °C. Fractions from the Uno Q-12 column containing 26 S proteasomes (i.e. peptidase activity that was inhibited by 0.02% SDS) were concentrated to 1 ml and loaded on a 38-ml glycerol gradient (23–37% glycerol in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmDTT, 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2). After centrifugation for 22 h at 100,000 × g, the gradient was fractionated, and the active fractions were pooled and concentrated. The resulting preparations showed one major band on the native gel and were not cross-contaminated (Fig.2 B).Figure 226 S proteasomes degrade nonubiquitinated, denatured proteins. A, denatured IGF (510 μm), lactalbumin (320 μm), casein (90 μm), and ovalbumin (14 μm) were incubated with 26 S proteasomes at 37 °C in 50 mm Bis-tris propane, 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5% glycerol. In order to ensure that 26 S proteasome functions at V max in these assays, substrate concentrations exceeded by severalfold the K m values for each protein (A. F. Kisselev, unpublished observations). Aliquots were analyzed for new amino groups using fluorescamine (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), which forms a fluorescent adduct with N termini of peptides, generated by proteasomal cleavage. A mixture of standard peptides was used to calibrate the assay (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). B, a native 5% PAGE was run using the system of Ornstein and Davis (52Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar, 55Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404Crossref PubMed Scopus (15912) Google Scholar). Lane 1, purified 20 S proteasomes; lane 2, purified 26 S proteasomes; lane 3, a mixture of ovalbumin and 26 S proteasome (from Fig. 2 A) after a 3-h incubation.

After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 900 μl of 1% SDS, and fluorescence of released Amc was measured (excitation, 380 nm; emission, 460 nm). In order to distinguish between 20 and 26 S proteasomes, the same incubation was repeated in the presence of 0.02% SDS instead of ATP. Peptide substrate incubated without proteasomes served as control. Alternatively, proteasomal activity was measured in a continuous assay. The proteasome sample (0.02–1 μg) was added into the cuvette containing 500 μl of substrate preincubated at 37 °C. Fluorescence of released Amc was monitored continuously for 10–20 min, and the reaction velocity was calculated from the slopes of the resulting reaction progress curves. Consumption of substrate at the end of incubation never exceeded 1%. Ovalbumin, bovine α-lactalbumin, and bovine β-casein were from Sigma, and recombinant human IGF was a kind gift of Dr. W. Prouty (Lilly). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-casein was prepared as described (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar); IGF and lactalbumin were denatured by reduction of disulfide bonds and carboxymethylation of the cysteins; and ovalbumin was treated with performic acid (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Casein, which has little tertiary structure, does not require denaturation in order to become a substrate of the proteasome. Finally, in order to reduce the background in the reaction with fluorescamine, lysine residues and N-terminal amino groups on all protein substrates were blocked by reductive methylation (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Denatured IGF, lactalbumin, casein, and ovalbumin were incubated with 20 or 26 S proteasomes at 37 °C in 50 mm Bis-tris propane, 1 mm DTT, 2–5% glycerol (30Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1982-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, for experiments with the 26 S particles, reaction buffer contained 0.5 mmATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and, for 20 S proteasomes, 0.02% SDS was added to stimulate the particles unless stated otherwise (as in Fig. 4). Aliquots were analyzed for new amino groups using fluorescamine (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), which forms a fluorescent adduct with N termini of peptides, generated by proteasomal cleavage. A mixture of standard peptides was used to calibrate the assay (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Pure 20 S proteasomes (∼0.8 μm) were incubated with 0.5 mm AEBSF (Pefablock SC, Boehringer Mannheim) for 1.5 h at room temperature, and all three peptidase activities were measured in continuous assay, using as substrates Suc-LLVY-Amc for the chymotrypsin-like activity,tert-butyloxycarbonyl-LRR-Amc for the trypsin-like activity, and Ac-YVAD-Amc for the postacidic activity. All substrates were obtained from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). The covalently modified enzyme was used in degradation reactions with casein and IGF as substrates. It is well established that 26 S proteasomes catalyze the degradation of proteins conjugated to ubiquitin (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

Because ubiquitinated substrates cannot be generated in homogeneous form in quantities necessary for analysis of the products, we tested whether 26 S proteasomes from rabbit muscle can degrade other proteins without ubiquitination. Indeed, in the presence of ATP, the highly purified 26 S particles degraded several denatured proteins (IGF, lactalbumin, ovalbumin) and casein at linear rates (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, the absolute rates of peptide bond cleavage (measured by the appearance of new amino groups) were faster with the smaller substrates (IGF and lactalbumin) than with casein or ovalbumin. To confirm that this degradation (Fig. 2 A) was indeed due to 26 S proteasomes, we analyzed the reaction mixtures by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 B). At the outset and after 3 h of incubation (lane 3), only 26 S proteasomes were detectable. Thus, the hydrolysis of these nonubiquitinated proteins was not due to contaminating 20 S particles or to 20 S generated by breakdown of 26 S proteasomes. Clearly,in vitro, and presumably in vivo, 26 S particles, like activated 20 S proteasomes, can hydrolyze some denatured proteins without ubiquitination. In order to test whether mammalian 26 and 20 S proteasomes degrade proteins processively, we incubated these enzymes with casein and analyzed at different times the nature of the products of the reaction by SDS-PAGE. 20 S proteasomes were purified in the latent state in the presence of glycerol but then were activated by the addition of 0.02% SDS. Despite the disappearance of casein, no Coomassie-stainable polypeptide fragments were detected in the gel (not shown), indicating that the substrate was degraded all the way to oligopeptides. To increase the sensitivity of the detection of individual peptide products, we initially used casein as a substrate that was covalently modified with FITC at multiple sites (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Incubation conditions were chosen to ensure a linear rate of breakdown of the FITC-casein and the presence of the substrate in large excess. At different times, the fluorescent products released by proteasomes were analyzed by HPLC on a reverse-phase column (Fig. 3). With both the 26 and 20 S particles, a large number of products were generated, indicating that the protein was cleaved at multiple sites. As the reaction proceeded, the areas under the individual product peaks increased in parallel with each other, but the relative amounts of these fluorescent products did not change, and no new peaks appeared. Thus, no peptides were generated that were degraded in subsequent proteolytic rounds. These results together demonstrate that activated 20 S proteasomes and the ATP-dependent 26 S particles degrade proteins in a highly processive manner into oligopeptides without dissociation of the substrate. A similar mechanism of protein breakdown was found earlier for the archaeal 20 S proteasomes (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). By contrast, when chymotrypsin, a typical nonprocessive protease, was incubated under similar conditions with casein (24 kDa), polypeptide fragments ranging from 14 to 20 kDa were generated (not shown), and with FITC-casein as the substrate, the pattern of fluorescent products varied with incubation time. Thus, unlike the proteasome, chymotrypsin released large products that were subsequently cleaved further (27Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Because proteolysis within the 26 S complex is catalyzed by its core 20 S proteasome, it has been widely assumed that the pattern of peptide bond cleavage by the 20 S proteasome reflects proteolysis by the larger 26 S particle. However, careful analysis of the spectra of peptides produced by the 20 and 26 S proteasomes showed the unexpected result that they generated different patterns of products. (See, for example, peptides eluted between 12 and 14 min in Fig. 3.) These differences in product patterns suggest that 20 and 26 S proteasomes can cleave proteins at different sites."

To examine whether Ssa1p drives polypeptides from the ER and is also required for degradation, we assembled reactions using strains either containing a mutation in SSA1 or in which the level of Ssa1p could be regulated.

The energy source required to drive these proteins from the ER, however, remains unknown, but it has been proposed to derive from the action of cytosolic molecular chaperones (1McCracken A.A. Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 27: 165-200Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that the protein translocation channel, composed of the Sec61p complex, mediates polypeptide extrusion from the ER. First, CPY*, a mutated form of vacuole-targeted carboxypeptidase Y, was stabilized in yeast strains containing a mutation inSEC61 (18Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Second, the degradation of an unglycosylated form of the yeast mating pheromone, pro-α factor (pαF), was inhibited in microsomes prepared from sec61 mutant strains (19Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). And third, ERAD substrates were co-immunoprecipitated with the mammalian Sec61p homologue en route to degradation (9Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar,17de Virgilio M. Weninger H. Ivessa N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9734-9743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A vital aspect of ERAD is its selectivity for specific soluble and integral membrane proteins, whereas the majority of ER resident and secreted proteins are stable (20Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1988; 54: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 21Wileman T. Carson G.R. Shih F.F. Concino M.F. Terhorst C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the nature of this substrate selectivity is not completely clear, structural motifs that are buried when proteins are correctly folded and assembled may be recognized by the ERAD machinery if protein folding is hindered (22Bonifacino J.S. Cosson P. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 63: 503-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 24Schmitz A. Maintz M. Kehle T. Herzog V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Two ER lumenal molecular chaperones, BiP and calnexin, are known to be involved in protein maturation and “quality control” in the ER and are likely candidates to play a role in ERAD. Calnexin is a lectin that binds transiently to monoglucosylated glycans and retains unfolded polypeptides in the ER lumen (25Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 26Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); therefore, calnexin could target misfolded proteins for ERAD. Support for this hypothesis derives from the observation that some mutant proteins in the mammalian ER bind to calnexin prior to their degradation (12Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 27Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and that partially inhibiting the interaction between calnexin and ApoB attenuated the ER-associated degradation of ApoB ∼2-fold (29Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, we discovered that ER-derived microsomes prepared from a yeast strain deleted for calnexin were compromised in their ability to degrade pαF in vitro (30McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). BiP, an hsp70 homologue, binds preferentially to hydrophobic arrays of amino acids (31Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 32Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), suggesting that BiP can recognize unfolded proteins. BiP is also required for protein translocation into the ER lumen in yeast, acting as a ratchet to prevent polypeptide egress from the ER, as a motor to actively drive substrates into the ER, and/or in conjunction with other proteins to regulate the translocation machinery (reviewed in Ref. 33Brodsky J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 121-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, BiP might promote polypeptide efflux during ERAD. Several investigators have uncovered a role for BiP during ERAD. First, iodination of a misfolded proinsulin polypeptide in vivoindicated co-localized signals for BiP binding and ERAD (24Schmitz A. Maintz M. Kehle T. Herzog V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Second, the dissociation of BiP from unassembled Ig chains correlated with the kinetics of Ig degradation (34Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Third, Skowronek et al. (35Skowronek M.H. Hendershot L.M. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1574-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) recently determined that the accelerated degradation of immunoglobulin light chain chimeras corresponded to enhanced BiP binding. And fourth, Plemper et al. (18Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) observed the inefficient degradation of CPY* in yeast containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding BiP,KAR2. Because the kar2 mutant used by Plemper et al. (18Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) to examine ERAD in yeast is also defective for protein translocation into the ER (36Sanders S.L. Whitfield K.M. Vogel J.P. Rose M.D. Schekman R.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 353-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 37Brodsky J.L. Goeckeler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), BiP may have been performing the same function during polypeptide export as in import. Therefore, to determine whether the function of BiP during polypeptide export and degradation is more elaborate than its role during translocation, we measured ERAD both in vitro and in vivo usingkar2 mutants that are translocation-proficient, as well as the kar2 mutant used previously (18Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that each of these mutants is defective for ERAD, indicating for the first time that BiP action during protein translocation into the ER and polypeptide efflux from the ER differs. Another hsp70 molecular chaperone, Ssa1p, is a cytosolic protein known to function in polypeptide import into the yeast ER (38Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 39Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Ssa1p was required to drive ERAD substrates from the ER, we examined ERAD in vitro and in vivousing strains either containing a temperature-sensitive mutation inSSA1 (38Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) or in which the levels of Ssa1p can be regulated (39Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 40Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar); however, we observed that ERAD activity was unaffected. We conclude from these combined results that BiP and Ssa1p play distinct roles during protein import and export and that the molecular mechanisms of polypeptide import and export from the yeast ER must differ.

Strains were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) at 25–30 °C unless a temperature-sensitive mutant phenotype was desired, in which case half of each log phase culture (A 600 = 0.5–1.0) was incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 45 min. MW141 was grown in YP-2% galactose/0.2% glucose (wild type) or the log phase culture was harvested, washed once with water, and resuspended in YP-2% glucose to deplete cellular Ssa1p (Ssa1p-depleted), as described (39Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). To assay for a synthetic interaction between KAR2 andCNE1, the calnexin-deleted strain (see above) (41Parlati F. Dominguez M. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 244-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was mated with MS111 and MS193, diploids were selected, and tetrad analysis was performed using standard methods (44Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The genotype of the progeny was assessed by replica-plating onto omission media. The translocation of a form of prepro-α factor (ppαF) in which the three core glycosylation consensus sites have been mutated (ΔGppαF) has been described (30McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In brief, ER-derived microsomes are incubated in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system and gel-purified, in vitro-translated 35S-labeled ppαF (37Brodsky J.L. Goeckeler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The translocation of ppαF is apparent by the generation of a signal sequence-cleaved product, pαF, that is protected from exogenous protease. Translocation is ATP-, time-, and temperature-dependent and is linear for up to 40 min.In vitro ERAD reactions to measure the degradation of pαF were then assembled as described (5Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 30McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Microsomes containing pαF were pelleted, washed once, and resuspended in a “chase” reaction containing an ATP-regenerating system and cytosol from the desired yeast strain. At the indicated time points, aliquots were removed, the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the products were resolved by 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/urea gels (30McCracken A.A.

The degradation of pαF in these reactions is also ATP-, time-, and temperature-dependent, but it requires the additional presence of yeast cytosol. The export of pαF from microsomes was detected by trypsin-treatment of ERAD reactions after incubating microsomes in the presence of cytosol and ATP, as described (5Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analysis to measure the in vivo degradation of A1PiZ was performed as previously published (5Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Ssa1p was purified from strain MW141 as described (45Brodsky J.L. Hamamoto S. Feldheim D. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared from a total of 2.0A 600 units of exponentially growing cells that were pelleted and washed once with 10 mm NaN3before the cell pellet was frozen at −20 °C and thawed on ice. A 20-μl aliquot of sample buffer (80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) was then added, and the samples were incubated at 95 °C for 2 min. A total of 0.12 g of glass beads (Sigma G-9268) was added, the cells were disrupted by agitation on a vortex mixer for 1 min, and 80μl of sample buffer was added before aliquots were reheated and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After the transfer of the electrophoresed proteins to nitrocellulose filters, antibodies against yeast BiP (45Brodsky J.L. Hamamoto S. Feldheim D. Schekman R. J.

Cell. 1989; 57: 1223-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and Ssa1p (45Brodsky J.L. Hamamoto S. Feldheim D. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) were used to probe the cell lysates and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or125I-protein A (Amersham) was used to detect the primary antibodies. The resulting blots were washed, and then exposed and processed either by phosphorimager analysis (when125I-protein A was used) or according to the manufacturer's specifications (when enhanced chemiluminescence detection was desired). The ability of an hsp110 chaperone to retain heat-denatured firefly luciferase in a folding-competent conformation was assayed as described (47Oh H.J. Chen X. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31636-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, firefly luciferase was incubated in the presence of the yeast hsp110 chaperone, Sse1p, at a 1:5 molar ratio and the mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. An ATP-regenerating system (37Brodsky J.L. Goeckeler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and yeast cytosol from the desired strain was added to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml, and the reaction was incubated at 26 °C. Aliquots at the indicated time points were assayed for luciferase activity in an Analytical Luminescence Laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI) Monolight luminometer using luciferin as the substrate. Although the refolding of luciferase in this assay requires cytosol, purified cytosolic hsp70 and a cognate DnaJ chaperone can substitute for the cytosolic requirement (47Oh H.J. Chen X. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31636-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), indicating that the chaperone activity of an hsp70 may be assayed using this procedure. Sse1p was purified from yeast over-expressing a hexa-histidine tagged form of Sse1p using nickel agarose affinity and ion exchange chromatography, 2J. L. Goeckeler and J. L. Brodsky, manuscript in preparation. and yeast cytosol was prepared as described previously (30McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We previously observed that ERAD was inhibited by ∼50% when assayed in yeast microsomes prepared from a strain deleted for calnexin (cne1) (30McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Multichaperone complexes containing BiP and calnexin have been noted in the mammalian ER (48Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and BiP and calnexin co-immunoprecipitate in extracts prepared from the yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe. 3Jannatipour, M., Callejo, M. Parodi, A. J., Armstrong, J., and Rokeach, L. A. (1998) Biochemistry 37,17253–17261 Therefore, we sought genetic interactions between the cne1 mutation and mutations in BiP (kar2–1 and kar2–133) that may prevent the ability of BiP to chaperone protein folding in the ER (43Simons J.F. Ferro-Novick S. Rose M.D. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,49Schonberger O. Hirst T.R. Pines O. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To this end, we mated the cne1 deleted strain (41Parlati F. Dominguez M. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 244-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) tokar2–1 and kar2–133 and dissected asci after sporulation of the diploids. Tetratype tetrads with respect toCNE1 and KAR2 were then identified. At least two representative tetratypes from each cross were analyzed, replated, and grown at 30, 35, or 37 °C. As shown in Fig.1, A and B, we observed that the kar2–1cne1Δ andkar2–133cne1Δ strains grew less well than the corresponding kar2–1 and kar2–133 strains at the semipermissive temperature of 35 °C, indicating a mild synthetic interaction between the kar2 and the cne1mutations. To confirm this result, we performed growth curves at 35 °C of each strain obtained from the kar2 ×cne1Δ crosses (Fig. 1, C and D). We noted again that the kar2 mutants grew somewhat better than the kar2cne1Δ double mutant strains at this temperature. These results suggest that BiP and calnexin may act in a common pathway in S. cerevisiae. To examine the role of BiP in ERAD, we prepared ER-derived microsomes from an isogenic wild type strain and three temperature-sensitive kar2strains, kar2–1, kar2–113, andkar2–133. The kar2–113 mutation converts a phenylalanine at position 196 to a leucine in the ATPase domain of BiP (42.Vogel, J. P., KAR 2, the Yeast Homologue of Mammalian BiP/Grp78. Ph.D. Thesis, 1993, Princeton University.Google Scholar), obstructs the import of polypeptides at 37 °C by inhibiting the association of translocating proteins with Sec61p (36Sanders S.L. Whitfield K.M. Vogel J.P. Rose M.D. Schekman R.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 353-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and compromises the degradation of an ERAD substrate, CPY*, in vivo (18Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Kar2–113p exhibits wild type ATPase activity but reduces the levels of both co- and posttranslational protein translocation into ER-derived microsomes (37Brodsky J.L. Goeckeler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These results, and others, suggest that BiP may regulate the translocation machinery (33Brodsky J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 121-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), a function likely to hinder ERAD because degraded substrates must be exported from the ER through the Sec61p complex (9Wiertz E.J.

By comparison, the kar2–1 and kar2–133 mutations are in the peptide binding domain of BiP (kar2–1, P515L;kar2–133, T473F) (42.Vogel, J. P., KAR 2, the Yeast Homologue of Mammalian BiP/Grp78. Ph.D. Thesis, 1993, Princeton University.Google Scholar), and protein translocation is unaffected, as determined by examining whether two ER-targeted substrates (ppαF and preinvertase) accumulate in vivo at the nonpermissive temperature (42.Vogel, J. P., KAR 2, the Yeast Homologue of Mammalian BiP/Grp78. Ph.D. Thesis, 1993, Princeton University.Google Scholar) and by examining whether the posttranslational translocation of an ER-targeted substrate (ppαF) (37Brodsky J.L. Goeckeler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was compromised in vitro (see below); 4J. L. Brodsky, unpublished observations. however, these mutations may affect the folding of specific proteins in the yeast ER (43Simons J.F. Ferro-Novick S. Rose M.D. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 49Schonberger O. Hirst T.R. Pines O. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We anticipated that defects in the ability of BiP to chaperone protein folding may also obstruct ERAD. To test this hypothesis, we translocated radiolabeled ΔGppαF into microsomes prepared from each mutant strain and an isogenic wild type strain. ΔGppαF is a form of the yeast mating pheromone precursor, ppαF, that cannot become glycosylated after signal sequence cleavage. The resulting product, pαF, is a substrate for ERAD in vitro when a posttranslocation chase is performed in the presence of wild type cytosol and hydrolyzable ATP (5Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 19Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K.

We found that the extent of ΔGppαF translocated into kar2–1 andkar2–133 mutant microsomes and wild type microsomes was similar, whereas translocation in the kar2–113 microsomes was ∼42% as efficient as in wild type microsomes (data not shown), in accordance with previous data (36Sand"

https://openalex.org/W1975516052,"Axin is a negative regulator of embryonic axis formation in vertebrates, which acts through a Wnt signal transduction pathway involving the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3 and β-catenin. Axin has been shown to have distinct binding sites for GSK-3 and β-catenin and to promote the phosphorylation of β-catenin and its consequent degradation. This provides an explanation for the ability of Axin to inhibit signaling through β-catenin. In addition, a more N-terminal region of Axin binds to adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a tumor suppressor protein that also regulates levels of β-catenin. Here, we report the results of a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the C-terminal third of Axin, a region in which no binding sites for other proteins have previously been identified. We found that Axin can bind to the catalytic subunit of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A through a domain between amino acids 632 and 836. This interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding studies as well as by co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins expressed in cultured cells. Our results suggest that protein phosphatase 2A might interact with the Axin·APC·GSK-3·β-catenin complex, where it could modulate the effect of GSK-3 on β-catenin or other proteins in the complex. We also identified a region of Axin that may allow it to form dimers or multimers. Through two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies, we demonstrated that the C-terminal 100 amino acids of Axin could bind to the same region as other Axin molecules.

Axin, the product of the mouse gene originally calledFused (1Reed S.C. Genetics. 1937; 22: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been shown to negatively regulate an early step in vertebrate embryonic axis formation, through its ability to modulate a Wnt signal transduction pathway (2Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The Fusedallele (Axin Fu), as well as two other spontaneous alleles, Kinky (Axin Ki) andKnobbly (Axin Kb), caused similar dominant phenotypes characterized mainly by kinking and shortening of the tail (1Reed S.C. Genetics. 1937; 22: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gluecksohn-Schoenheimer S. J. Exp. Zool. 1949; 110: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Jacobs-Cohen R.J. Spiegelman M. Cookingham J.C. Bennett D. Genet. Res. 1984; 43: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Axin Ki and Axin Kb also caused recessive embryonic lethality at E8–E10. A fourth allele,Axin Tgl, induced by a random transgene insertion, had no dominant effects but caused recessive lethal embryonic defects similar to those observed in Axin Ki/Ki orAxin Kb/Kb embryos (5Perry W.L.I. Vasicek T.J. Lee J.J. Rossi J.M. Zeng L. Zhang T. Tilghman S.M. Costantini F. Genetics. 1995; 141: 321-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos homozygous for any of the recessive lethal alleles showed frequent neuroectodermal defects, including truncation or incomplete closure of the anterior neural folds, as well as cardiac defects. An intriguing feature of many homozygous embryos was a duplication of the embryonic axis, suggesting a role for Axin in embryonic axial development (3Gluecksohn-Schoenheimer S. J. Exp. Zool. 1949; 110: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Perry W.L.I. Vasicek T.J. Lee J.J. Rossi J.M. Zeng L. Zhang T. Tilghman S.M. Costantini F.

With the aid of the Axin Tgl insertional allele, the gene was cloned, and the wild type and mutant Axin alleles were characterized (2Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L.

The murine Axin gene is ubiquitously expressed in wild type embryos and adult tissues, encoding a major mRNA of ∼4 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RGS, regulation of G-protein signaling; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RGS, regulation of G-protein signaling; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin.and a minor 3-kb mRNA. The ∼4-kb mRNA is found in two isoforms that encode proteins of 956 (form 1) and 992 amino acids (form 2). Form 2 is identical to form 1 except for an insertion of 36 amino acids at position 856, due to alternative splicing. The Axin sequence revealed two regions of homology to other protein families as follows: an RGS domain (8De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) at amino acids 213–338 and a “DIX domain” (10Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar) at the extreme C terminus. The RGS domains of bona fide RGS (Regulation of G-protein Signaling) proteins bind to GαaI proteins and serve as a GTPase-activating proteins (reviewed in Ref. 11Dohlman H.G. Thorners J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). However, the Axin RGS domain differed from the consensus at most of the residues that make important contacts with the Giαa switch regions (12Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), suggesting that it probably has a different function. The DIX domain is a region of similarity between the N terminus of Disheveled proteins (Drosophila Dsh and its vertebrate homologs) and the C terminus of Axin (10Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). Whereas truncation of a 165-amino acid N-terminal segment of Dsh, including this domain, abolished its activity in a Drosophila cell culture assay for Wingless signaling (13Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), the specific role of this domain remains obscure. Thus, the sequence of Axin provided few clues as to its function. In both the Axin Tgl and Axin Kballeles, synthesis of the full-length mRNAs is precluded by a transgene insertion in the former (2Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 5Perry W.L.I. Vasicek T.J. Lee J.J. Rossi J.M. Zeng L. Zhang T. Tilghman S.M. Costantini F. Genetics. 1995; 141: 321-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a retroviral insertion in the latter (7Vasicek T.J. Zeng L. Guan X.J. Zhang T. Costantini F. Tilghman S.M. Genetics. 1997; 147: 777-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As both of these alleles caused axial duplication, it was suggested that Axin normally plays a negative regulatory role in the response to an axis-inducing signal in early mouse embryogenesis. This hypothesis was supported by the ability of Axin mRNA to block dorsal axis formation, i.e. to “ventralize,” when injected into early Xenopus embryos. Further analyses revealed that this ability is due to the inhibitory effect of Axin on a Wnt signaling pathway required for dorsal axis formation (2Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway, which is closely related to the wingless signaling pathway of Drosophila, includes GSK-3, a serine/threonine kinase also involved in glycogen metabolism, and β-catenin, a protein also involved in cell adhesion (reviewed in Ref.14Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). When active, GSK-3 can phosphorylate β-catenin (15Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), leading to its degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system (16Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). In the presence of certain Wnts, GSK-3 is inhibited (through an unknown mechanism involving the cytoplasmic protein Dsh), allowing β-catenin to accumulate in the cytosol and to interact with transcription factors of the LEF/Tcf family (17Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destree O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar, 18Riese J. Yu X. Munnerlyn A. Eresh S. Hsu S.C. Grosschedl R. Bienz M. Cell. 1997; 88: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). β-Catenin and LEF/Tcf then translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to DNA and activate target genes, which, in the early Xenopus embryo, include the homeobox gene Siamois (19Fagotto F. Guger K. Gumbiner B.M. Development. 1997; 124: 453-460PubMed Google Scholar, 20Carnac G. Kodjabachian L. Gurdon J.B. Lemaire P. Development. 1996; 122: 3055-3065PubMed Google Scholar, 21Brannon M. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Through co-injection experiments, Axin was found to inhibit this signaling pathway at a level downstream of Wnt, Dsh, and GSK-3 but upstream of β-catenin and Siamois. Thus, it was proposed that Axin, directly or indirectly, stimulated the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3 (2Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). This prediction has been supported by several recent studies, which showed that Axin binds directly to GSK-3 and β-catenin, through distinct domains at amino acids 477–561 and 561–630, respectively (22Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Itoh K. Krupnik V.E. Sokol S.Y. Curr.

A. 1998; 95: 3020-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). By simultaneously binding GSK-3β and β-catenin, Axin appears to promote the phosphorylation of β-catenin on serine/threonine residues. Axin also binds to APC, another protein implicated in the regulation of β-catenin (26Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar, 27Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B.

Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of APC binding in the function of Axin remains unclear; a truncated Axin lacking the entire N terminus, including the RGS domain, still promoted the turnover of β-catenin (22Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in mammalian cells, whereas an internal deletion of only the RGS domain abolished the ventralizing ability of Axin in Xenopusembryos (2Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). So far, the role of the C-terminal third of Axin (beyond the β-catenin binding region) is unclear. To identify proteins that interact with this region of Axin, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the C-terminal 324 amino acids. We have thus identified a region of Axin that binds to the serine-threonine phosphatase PP2A. Our results suggest that PP2A may interact with the complex containing Axin, APC, GSK-3 and β-catenin, where it could serve to antagonize the effects of the kinase GSK-3. We also identified a C-terminal region of Axin that can bind to itself, suggesting that the protein may exist as a dimer or multimer. The bait plasmid pGBT9-Axin-(632–956) was constructed by inserting the PstI fragment of Axin cDNA (form 1) into the PstI site of pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH) to generate a Gal4DB-Axin fusion protein in yeast. This plasmid was sequenced to confirm that the coding sequences for Gal4DB and Axin were in frame. A series of pGBT9-Axin plasmids containing different regions of the Axin cDNA (Fig. 5) were created using convenient restriction enzyme sites. A method to create unidirectional nested deletions of double-stranded DNA clones using exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease was also performed to generate pGBT9-Axin-(632–910) and pGBT9-Axin-(632–836) (Exo-Size Deletion Kit, New England Biolabs). To express N-terminal FLAG-tagged Axin proteins in 293T cell, DNA fragments containing different regions of FLAG-Axin cDNA were cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing a CMV promoter (pcDNA3, Invitrogen). The pCMVT7-p36 plasmid contains a full-length PP2Ac cDNA that is tagged at the N terminus with T7 and inserted into the pCDNA3 vector. The pCMVHA-PR65 plasmid contains a full-length regulatory A subunit of PP2A tagged with HA at N terminus (29Hemmings B.A. Adams-Pearson C. Maurer F. Muller P. Goris J. Merlevede W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Three fragments of Axin cDNA were cloned downstream of the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) gene to generate pGST-Axin-(421–810), pGST-Axin-(632–810), and pGST-Axin-(632–956) plasmids and to produce recombinant proteins. The PP2Ac cDNA was inserted into a vector containing a translation initiation sequence and a FLAG-tag sequence to create the pBFT4-PP2Ac plasmid for in vitro transcription and translation. pGADNOT-PP2Accontains a full-length mouse PP2Ac cDNA cloned into a pGADNOT prey vector (30Dunaief J.L.

The pGAD424-Axin-(194–956) plasmid contains an Axin cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 194–956 inserted into the pGAD424 prey vector (CLONTECH). The pGAD-PR65 plasmid contains a cDNA fragment encoding the full-length regulatory A subunit of PP2A cloned into the pGAD prey vector (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pGBT9-Axin-(632–956) plasmid was co-transformed with an expression library consisting of cDNAs from a murine macrophage cell line WEHI-3, which were cloned into the pGADNOT prey vector (30Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), into the yeast Y190 strain. Yeast transformants were grown on synthetic medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. The expression of his andlacZ reporter genes were used to assay for clones encoding proteins that associate with Axin. The positive colonies were then grown on synthetic medium lacking only leucine to lose the pGBT9-Axin-(632–956) plasmid and to test for absence of β-galactosidase activity in the absence of the bait vector. To recover the pGADNOT plasmids, extracts of plasmid DNA from yeast were introduced into Escherichia coli JM83 by electroporation. Each of the pGADNOT plasmids was then co-transformed with pGBT-Axin-(632–956) plasmid into yeast Y190. Transformants were grown on synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan and tested the ability to bind Axin in the β-galactosidase filter assay. Inserts of cDNA clones showing interaction with pGBT9-Axin-(632–956) were sequenced. pGST-Axin-(421–810), pGST-Axin-(632–810), and pGST-Axin-(632–956) plasmids were used to express and purify recombinant GST fusion proteins as described previously (32Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PP2Ac RNA was transcribedin vitro from pBFT4-PP2Ac using T7 RNA polymerase. PP2Ac protein was translated with reticulocyte lysate and labeled with [35S]methionine in vitro (Promega). In vitro binding of GST-Axin and PP2Ac was essentially as described (32Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The labeled PP2Ac proteins were incubated with GST or GST-Axin proteins in the association buffer, and protein complexes were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 293T cells were transfected by a calcium phosphate-mediated transfection method (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.36Google Scholar) at 24 h after plating (2.0 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish). Ten mg of each plasmid DNA was used in each reaction, and sonicated salmon sperm DNA was used as a supplement to maintain the same DNA concentration in each transfection. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed for protein expression and binding analyses. Protein extracts or immunoprecipitated complexes were subject to immunoblotting as described (34Harlow E. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG (Kodak), anti-T7 conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Novagen), or anti-Myc (Calbiochem) monoclonal antibodies were used to analyze the presence of tagged proteins in transfected cells. Except for anti-T7, bound antibodies were then detected with a goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (American Qualex) and visualized by the chromogenic substrate reaction. 293T cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml antipain, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-FLAG or polyclonal anti-PP2Ac antibody (Promega), followed by immunoblotting analysis. A cDNA sequence encoding a C-terminal segment of Axin (amino acids 632–956, form 1) was cloned into the pGBT9 bait vector to produce a Gal4-DNA-binding domain-Axin fusion protein for yeast two-hybrid screening (35Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Because Axin is expressed in most if not all cell types, a murine macrophage cDNA library cloned in the pGADNOT prey vector was screened to identify proteins that can interact with Axin. After co-transformation of pGBT9-Axin-(632–956) with the expression library, 12 colonies out of approximately 50,000 potential transformants survived on synthetic medium lacking histidine (Table I, 1o screen). The growth of these colonies implied that they contained clones encoding proteins that bound to Axin-(632–956) and also suggested the expression of the his reporter gene under the control of a Gal4-responsive promoter in these transformants. The expression of a second Gal4-responsive reporter gene, β-galactosidase, was found in 9/12 of these colonies (Table I, 2o screen). All nine of these clones tested negative for β-galactosidase in the absence of the bait vector pGBT9-Axin-(632–956) (Table I, 3o screen).Table ISummary of identification of Axin-binding proteins by yeast two-hybrid screeningScreening/clone no.1234567891011121°-his+++++++++++++2°-β-Gal+++++++++−−+−3°-No bait plasmid, β-Gal+−−−−−−−−NANA−NA4°-Reconstitution, +Gal4DB−−−−−−−−NANA−NA+Gal4DB-Axin−−+−−−+−NANA+NAThe primary selection was the growth of yeast transformants on histidine−medium (1°), followed by the expression of a second reporter gene (2°), β-galactosidase (β-Gal).

The pGADNOT prey plasmids were recovered from these nine transformants. Only three of them exhibited the ability to bind to Axin upon co-transformation with pGBT9-Axin-(632–956) in the yeast two-hybrid system (Table I, 4o screen). Two of the three plasmids contained a 1.9-kb DNA insert and the other a 1.3-kb insert. DNA sequence analysis of the two 1.9-kb clones showed that they were identical and encoded a mouse protein displaying 99% amino acid identity to the α isoform of the catalytic subunit of rat and human serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac). 2The nucleotide sequence for the mouse PP2Ac gene has been deposited under accession numberAF076192. The 1.3-kb clone encoded a C-terminal segment of Axin protein (amino acids 831–956 of form 1). These data suggest that Axin binds to PP2Ac and also associates with itself through the C-terminal region. PP2A is a heterotrimeric enzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit (C) associated with a 65-kDa regulatory subunit (A) and a third variable subunit (B) (36Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar, 37Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 38Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In mammals, the closely related α and β isoforms of PP2Ac are encoded by separate genes but are indistinguishable in function. Axin contains several predicted sites for Ser/Thr phosphorylation (2Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), and Ser/Thr phosphorylation of β-catenin is thought to play a critical role in Wnt signaling (14Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar,15Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). This suggested that the Axin·PP2Ac interaction might be biologically significant. Therefore, the ability of PP2Ac to interact physically with Axin was independently examined by an in vitro binding assay (Fig.1). Three different recombinant GST-Axin fusion proteins and control GST protein were bacterially expressed and purified (Fig. 1 A) and were incubated with in vitro synthesized, 35S-labeled PP2Ac. Analysis of protein complexes precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose indicated that PP2Ac bound to a C-terminal region of Axin, amino acids 632–956 (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). However, two fusion proteins lacking the last 146 amino acids, GST-Axin-(421–810) and GST-Axin-(632–810), failed to bind PP2Ac (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). To examine the association of Axin and PP2Ac in vivo, T7 epitope-tagged PP2Ac and three different FLAG-tagged Axin proteins were transiently expressed in 293T cells (Fig.2, A and B). PP2Ac was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Axin-(632–956), which contains a C-terminal polypeptide identical to the one used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen, but not with FLAG-Axin-(194–475), which includes the RGS domain (Fig. 2 C). The FLAG-Axin-(632–992), derived from form 2 of Axin, also co-precipitated with PP2Ac, suggesting that both isoforms of Axin interact with PP2Ac regardless of the 36 amino acids insertion (Fig.2 C). Similar results were also obtained when cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 2 D). These data agree with the conclusions from yeast two-hybrid and in vitro biochemical analyses, confirming the ability of Axin and PP2Ac to interact in vivo. The interaction of Axin and PP2Ac in various experimental assays raised the question whether Axin binds directly to the PP2Ac subunit or whether it might associate indirectly with PP2Ac by binding to the regulatory A subunit, which itself binds tightly to the catalytic subunit. A co-immunoprecipitated assay was first performed to test whether the regulatory A subunit was present in the Axin·PP2Ac complex. The T7-tagged PP2Ac and HA-tagged PR65 (regulatory A subunit of PP2A) were transiently expressed together with four different Myc- or Flag-tagged Axin proteins in 293T cells (Fig.3, A and B). PR65 only co-precipitated with Axin proteins that contain the PP2A-binding domain, indicating that PR65 can indeed associate with Axin in vivo (Fig. 3 C). Next, the yeast two-hybrid assay was used to analyze further the ability of Axin to bind to PR65. Unlike the catalytic subunit, PR65 failed to show any interaction with Axin in this assay (Table II). We therefore conclude that Axin can bind directly to the PP2Ac catalytic subunit and only indirectly to PR65.Table IIThe regulatory A subunit of PP2A, PR65, does not interact with Axin in the yeast two-hybrid system.BaitPreyβ-Gal filter assayAxin-(632–956)PP2Ac+++PP2AcPR65+++Axin-(194–956)PR65−Axin-(632–956)PR65−Axin-(632–992)PR65−In a control experiment, PR65 was able to interact with PP2Ac, its normal partner, in this assay. +++, dark blue developed after 5 h of β-galactosidase (β-Gal) assay; −, only white color after 12 h of β-galactosidase assay.

The cloning of a fragment of Axin by the yeast two-hybrid screen with pGBT9-Axin-(632–956) (Table I) raised the possibility that Axin may form dimers or high order complexes with itself. The self-association of Axin was tested using the co-immunoprecipitated assay (Fig.4). A Myc epitope-tagged Axin-(811–956), which could be distinguished from FLAG-tagged Axin proteins, was transiently expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 4 A).

Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible splitting of dihydrogen (H2 ↔ 2H+ + 2e−) and are common in many microorganisms. Their physiological role is either to acquire reducing equivalents from H2 or to dispose of excess reducing equivalents from fermentation via the reduction of protons. Hydrogenases are often intimately complexed to modules containing other redox proteins. In this way the metabolism of dihydrogen is linked to redox chemistry with a wide variety of electron acceptors and donors like NAD(P)(H), b- and c-type cytochromes, factor F420, S2−, and membrane-bound (mena)quinones. With regard to the overall metal content three classes of hydrogenases can be discriminated. The majority of hydrogenases contain nickel in addition to iron and are termed [NiFe]-hydrogenases. The minimal protein unit required for activity contains two subunits, a large one (46–72 kDa) and a small one (23–38 kDa; for review see Ref. 1Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 167-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme from Desulfovibrio gigas disclosed (2Volbeda A. Charon M.-H. Piras C.

The iron atom has three non-protein ligands, with an electron density equivalent to diatomic molecules. The small subunit contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters and one [3Fe-4S] cluster. From a comparison of the amino acid sequences of [NiFe]-hydrogenases, it can be concluded that only the cubane cluster closest to the active site is conserved in all enzymes (1Albracht S.P.J.

As the frequency of these bands is very sensitive to the status of the active site, it was concluded that they are due to intrinsic ligands (diatomic molecules with a triple bond or triatomic molecules with two adjacent double bonds) of the active site. Also a unique lone low spin Fe(II) site was detected, in addition to the high spin iron sites of the Fe-S clusters, by Mössbauer spectroscopy (7Surerus K.K. Chen M. van der Zwaan W. Rusnak F.M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 115-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar); no other metal than iron is present in these enzymes. The prosthetic groups are located in only one subunit and minimally consist of two classical [4Fe-4S] clusters and a hydrogen-activating site, called the H cluster. The latter active site was speculated to be an Fe-S cluster with 4–7 iron atoms (9Hagen W.R. Van Berkel-Arts A. Krüse-Wolters K.M. Voordouw G. Veeger C.

Hence a similar architecture was suggested for the active sites of [NiFe]- and [Fe]-hydrogenases. The third class of hydrogenases does not contain any metal and occurs in methanogenic Archaea (11Zirngibl C. Van Dongen W. Schwörer B. Von Bünau R. Richter M. Klein A. Thauer R.K. Eur. J.

These enzymes, H2-formingN 5,N 10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterine dehydrogenases, can activate H2 only in the presence of their second substrate. In this paper we present spectroscopic as well as chemical evidence that the molecules observed in the FTIR spectra of [NiFe]-hydrogenases are one CO and two CN− groups bound to iron in the Ni-Fe active site. A preliminary report of this work has appeared elsewhere (13Happe R.P. Roseboom W. Pierik A.J. Albracht S.P.J. Bagley K.A. Nature. 1997; 385: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). C. vinosum (strain DSM 185) was grown in a 700-liter batch culture as described (14Coremans J.M.C.C. Van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For 15N or 13C enrichment, cells were grown in 10-liter batch cultures with 20 mm15NH4Cl as nitrogen source or 58 mm NaH13CO3 as carbon source. Isotopes were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, UK). Three different cultures were prepared with final, calculated enrichments of 98% 15N, 49% 15N, or 99%13C. The cultures were maintained at pH 7.5 by the addition of 1 m sodium phosphate buffer. Cells were harvested, and the enzyme was isolated and purified as described previously (14Coremans J.M.C.C. Van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Due to the limited amounts of isotope-enriched samples, it was decided to omit the TSK-DEAE column step in the purification procedure. The Ultragel ACA-44 column was replaced by a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 one. The purity of these samples, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), was therefore only 40–60%. Enzyme was dissolved in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations were determined according to Ref. 16Bradford M.M. Anal.

X-band EPR measurements (9 GHz) were obtained with a Bruker ECS 106 EPR spectrometer, equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 helium-flow cryostat with an ITC-4 temperature controller. The magnetic field was calibrated with an AEG Magnetic Field Meter. The frequency was measured with an HP 5350B Microwave Frequency Counter. FTIR measurements were performed on a Bio-Rad FTS 60A spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. The spectra were recorded at room temperature with a resolution of 2 cm−1 and are averages of 762 or 1524 scans. Enzyme samples (10 μl, 0.4–1.5 mm) were loaded into a gas-tight IR-transmittance cell (4Bagley K.A. Van Garderen C.J. Chen M. Duin E.C. Albracht S.P.J. Woodruff W.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9229-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with polished CaF2 windows kept at 50 μm distance with a Teflon spacer. A cell containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) was used as reference. The small, variable contributions of water vapor was removed by subtraction of an appropriate water-vapor spectrum. The multi-point method of the Bio-Rad spectrometer was used for correction of the base line. Hydrogenase activities were determined as previously (14Coremans J.M.C.C. Van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). TheC. vinosum enzyme samples used in this study displayed specific H2 uptake activities (after activation under H2 for 30 min at 45 °C) with benzyl viologen as acceptor in the range of 100–200 μmol of H2/min/mg (30 °C, pH 8.0). Iron and nickel were determined with a Hitachi 180–80 polarized Zeeman Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer using a standard series of the particular metal. Adventitious metal ions were eliminated from enzyme and buffer by passage through a Chelex 100 column (Bio-Rad). Relative metal contents were found to be 10–13 iron per nickel, in line with the presence of one iron atom in the active site and two [4Fe-4S] and one [3Fe-4S] clusters. The protein concentrations determined by the Bradford method correlated well with the values based on the metal contents, using a molecular mass of 94 kDa (14Coremans J.M.C.C. Van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Usually, hydrogenase of C. vinosum as isolated in air is a mixture of two forms, called ready and unready, with quite different EPR spectra and slightly different FTIR spectra. Therefore, enzyme was converted to more than 90% into the ready form as follows. A dilute solution (10 μm) was incubated under 1.2 bar of H2 at 50 °C for at least 30 min, cooled to 2 °C, evacuated, and flushed twice with argon, after which argon was substituted by 1.2 bar of O2. After stirring for 10 min at 2 °C and 60 min at room temperature, the sample was concentrated by means of a Microcon PM10 to about 300 μl and inspected by EPR to verify the conversion into the ready form. The sample was recovered from the EPR tube and concentrated to 10 μl. As some spin coupling of nickel with the {X ox = [3Fe-4S]+} moiety (X is an unknown,n = 1 redox component which, when oxidized, is strongly spin coupled to the oxidized [3Fe-4S]+ cluster (7Surerus K.K. Chen M. van der Zwaan W. Rusnak F.M. Kolk M. Duin E.C. Albracht S.P.J. Münck E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4980-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) was detected, it was treated with freshly prepared phenazine methosulfate (5 μm) and neutralized ascorbic acid (25 mm), which removes this coupling by reduction of the unknown groupX. The sample was loaded into the IR transmittance cell and incubated for 30 min at room temperature before recording the spectrum. No reduction of the active site itself was noticed in the FTIR spectra (5Bagley K.A. Duin E.C. Roseboom W. Albracht S.P.J. Woodruff W.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5527-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Before use, H2 was passed over a Palladium catalyst (Degussa, Hanau, Germany; type E236P), and argon was passed through an Oxisorb cartridge (Messer-Griesheim, Düsseldorf, Germany) to remove residual O2. The direct demonstration of CO(g), released from hydrogenase upon denaturation was performed by binding to ferrous hemoglobin, essentially as described earlier (17Bonam D. Murrel S.A. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 693-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, hydrogenase of C. vinosum (2.5–5 nmol) was denatured by treatment with 5% SDS under an argon atmosphere in 700-μl vials with lined aluminum seals. The sample was incubated for 10 min at 95 °C. After cooling, the vial was incubated for 60 min at room temperature under continuous stirring. After a short centrifugation to spin down any water droplets, the total gas phase in the head space was carefully withdrawn with a gas-tight Hamilton syringe, while at the same time water was injected with another syringe to balance the under-pressure. The removed gas was injected into an anaerobic cuvette, filled with an assay mixture containing 0.9 mg/ml hemoglobin, 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm sodium dithionite, and 25 mm CAPSO buffer (pH 9.5) under an argon atmosphere (17Bonam D. Murrel S.A. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 693-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture was equilibrated with the gas phase for 30 min at room temperature, by repeatedly turning the cuvette upside down on a rotating tilted plate. Then the absorption spectrum was recorded from 400 to 460 nm on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A Diode Array Spectrophotometer, using a cuvette without added CO as background. Binding of CO to reduced hemoglobin leads to a blue shift of the Soret band (increase in the extinction coefficient for Hb at 420 nm from 109.5 to 192 mm−1·cm−1 and decrease of the extinction coefficient for Hb at 430 nm from 140 to 60 mm−1·cm−1 (17Bonam D. Murrel S.A. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 693-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and hence a ΔE(420–430 nm) = 162.5 mm−1·cm−1 was used for quantification of the formed Hb-CO species. The recovery of the overall procedure tested with samples of CO-saturated water was 91%. A common approach to determine cyanide in aqueous solutions is to acidify the sample with sulfuric acid, followed by heating of the mixture. The evolved HCN gas (boiling point, 299 K) is transported by means of a carrier gas and led through an alkaline solution, which absorbs the HCN (18Boxer G.E. Rickards J.C. Arch. Biochem. 1952; 39: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The collected cyanide can be determined by spectrophotometric procedures based on a modified König's reaction (19Nagashima S. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1978; 99: 197-201Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which starts with the production of cyanogen chloride. This is followed by a reaction of the cyanogen chloride with a pyridine derivative resulting in ring opening, thereby producing a 2-pentenedial derivative. Subsequently, a condensation reaction between the 2-pentenedial derivative and an active methylenecarbonyl compound is performed, e.g. with barbituric acid, with pyrazolone or with 2-thiobarbituric acid (19Nagashima S. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1978; 99: 197-201Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present work the isonicotinic acid/barbituric acid method was applied (Fig. 1), modified from Nagashima (19Nagashima S. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1978; 99: 197-201Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), using 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid as described (20Meeussen J.C.L. Temminghoff E.J.M. Keizer M.G. Novozamsky I. Analyst. 1989; 114: 959-963Crossref Google Scholar), under less extreme conditions (18Boxer G.E. Rickards J.C. Arch. Biochem. 1952; 39: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The blue product of the latter reaction is polymethine, having an absorption maximum at 600 nm. Color development using 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid is faster and more intense compared with that of barbituric acid (20Meeussen J.C.L. Temminghoff E.J.M. Keizer M.G. Novozamsky I. Analyst. 1989; 114: 959-963Crossref Google Scholar). The determination of cyanide in the hydrogenase of C. vinosum was performed by mild oxidative treatment with potassium permanganate in sulfuric acid (18Boxer G.E. Rickards J.C. Arch. Biochem. 1952; 39: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), followed by detection of cyanide as described above. The methods have been optimized for the use with iron-sulfur proteins as described below. An appropriate setup was built using a 10-ml double-necked round-bottom flask, filled with 4.3 ml of distilled water, 20 μl of 3% (w/w) silicone anti-foaming agent (BDH, Poole, UK), and 250 μl of 3 mH2SO4. A small magnetic stirring bar was used for mixing. The flask contained a gas inlet, consisting of a thin glass tube reaching to the bottom. During the reaction, a flow of argon gas was bubbled through the solution (20–30 ml/min). As acid-labile sulfur is released upon destruction of iron-sulfur clusters in the protein by acid, it is likely, and was actually observed, that any S0 formed reacts with cyanide to form thiocyanate (21Mitchell C.A. Grant J. Barger G. Falk K.G. Bergeim O. Buchanan G.H. Schryver S.B. Buston H.W. Mitchell C.A. Allen's Commercial Organic Analysis, The Cyanogen Compounds. VIII. J. & A. Churchill, London1930: 492-579Google Scholar). This would reduce the yield of the cyanide from the enzyme. We therefore added up to 200 μl of 5 mmKMnO4 prior to heating in order to re-oxidize possible SCN− to CN− in the sulfuric acid environment (18Boxer G.E. Rickards J.C. Arch. Biochem. 1952; 39: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was heated in a water bath to 95 °C, after which 50–250 μl of hydrogenase (about 10 nmol) was added by injection through a septum. Heating under a steady flow of argon was continued for 30 min. The carrier gas was led through 1 ml of 100 mm NaOH to collect the HCN. The tube was weighed before and after the experiment to correct for evaporation. In a reaction tube, 0.5 ml of the NaOH solution containing the collected HCN, 1.5 ml of distilled water, 0.5 ml of succinate solution (2 m), and 0.05 ml of 1% chloramine T were mixed and kept for about 1 min at room temperature at pH 5.6. Because of the volatility of cyanogen chloride, it was desirable to add the color reagent as soon as its formation had reached a maximum, which was after about 1 min, as also found previously (22Epstein J. Anal. Chem. 1947; 19: 272-274Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The succinate solution (2 m succinic acid, 2.6 m NaOH) was prepared by slow addition of NaOH to a cold suspension of succinic acid. Afterward the solution was filtered. A color reagent solution was prepared by adding 2.8 g of 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid and 2.3 g of isonicotinic acid to 150 ml of distilled water. Solid NaOH (∼1.3 g), required to dissolve the acids (23Tanaka A. Deguchi K. Deguchi T. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1992; 261: 281-286Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and to adjust the pH to 5.6, was then slowly added, thereafter the solution was diluted to 250 ml with distilled water. To the mixture as obtained under “Oxidation of Cyanide with Chloramine T to Form Cyanogen Chloride,” 0.45 ml of color reagent was added and left for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a glass cuvette, and the polymethine concentration was determined by measuring its absorbance at 600 nm using a Zeiss M4 QIII spectrophotometer. A sample of 0.5 ml of pure 100 mm NaOH, treated in the same way, was used as a blank. A series of KSCN samples (0–20 nmol), prepared from a 0.0998 m solution in water (volumetric KSCN standard, Aldrich), was used as a standard curve. This curve was linear in the used range and gave precisely the same color as a series of KCN solutions but is more convenient for routine analyses. It was observed that beyond a certain concentration of KMnO4, the amount of HCN released from hydrogenase increased steadily (Fig. 2 ). By using BSA, it was found that HCN could develop from pure protein as well, if the concentration of KMnO4 used per mg of protein exceeded a certain value (about 0.5 mm per mg; Fig. 2). Therefore, routinely cyanide determinations were carried out using 0.05–0.2 mm KMnO4 and 0.5–1 mg of protein. With these amounts virtually no HCN was released from protein (Fig. 2). The recovery of KCN or KSCN added to the distillation setup as described above was determined to be at least 90%; therefore, no correction for loss during distillation of the cyanide was made. In order to test whether the IR-detectable groups could be exchanged with added cyanide, hydrogenase of C. vinosum was treated with K13CN (Aldrich). One sample was incubated with 5 mm K13CN for 24 h at 30 °C in air at pH 8.0, and directly loaded to the IR transmittance cell. A similar incubation was carried out in the presence of 8m urea, in order to loosen the protein structure to a certain extent (C. vinosum hydrogenase is stable in 8m urea (24Strekas Y. Antanaitis B.C. Krasna A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 616: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) and to possibly make the active site more accessible. Prior to the measurements urea was removed from the sample by dialysis. In another experiment an incubation with 2 mmK13CN was carried out with enzyme activated under H2 for 30 min at 50 °C. In Fig. 3 ,trace A, the FTIR spectrum of C. vinosum[NiFe]-hydrogenase in the ready form is shown. Two small bands (2090 and 2079 cm−1) and one large band (1944 cm−1) can be seen. Enzyme enriched in 13C showed the spectrum intrace B. The large band was shifted to 1899 cm−1, whereas a small band (1943 cm−1) was still detectable at the original position. The two bands at 2090 and 2079 cm−1 shifted to 2046 and 2035 cm−1. It is concluded that all groups responsible for the IR bands intrace A contain carbon. Enrichment of the enzyme with 15N resulted in a shift of the two small bands (Fig. 3, trace C) to 2060 and 2049 cm−1. The position of the large band was not affected. Hence, the groups responsible for the two small IR absorption bands contain nitrogen, whereas the group evoking the large absorption band does not. All band positions are summarized in TableI.Table IInfrared absorption bands in the 2150 to 1850 cm−1 spectral region for unlabeled, 13C-enriched, and 15N-enriched C. vinosum hydrogenase in the ready formEnzymeBand 1Band 2Band 3cm−1cm−1cm−1Unlabeled2090.1aSymmetrical vibration of two vibrationally coupled cyanide groups.2079.1bAntisymmetrical vibration of two vibrationally coupled cyanide groups.1943.613C-Enriched (99%)Calculated2046.22035.41900.3Observed2045.72034.81898.8 (1943.0)Observed frequency shift−44.4−44.3−44.815N-Enriched (98%)Calculated2057.82047.0Observed2060.42048.91943.0Observed frequency shift−29.7−30.2−0.615N-Enriched (49%)Observed2085.4cν(CN) stretch frequencies of C14N in enzyme molecules with a combination of C14N and C15N ligands.2053.4dν(CN) stretch frequencies of C15N in enzyme molecules with a combination of C15N ligands.1943.1a Symmetrical vibration of two vibrationally coupled cyanide groups.b Antisymmetrical vibration of two vibrationally coupled cyanide groups.c ν(CN) stretch frequencies of C14N in enzyme molecules with a combination of C14N and C15N ligands.d ν(CN) stretch frequencies of C15N in enzyme molecules with a combination of C15N ligands. Open table in a new tab The results in Fig. 3 indicate that the two small bands are presumably due to CN− groups. The two bands may reflect the symmetrical and antisymmetrical vibrations of two vibrationally coupled CN− groups (25Cotton F.A. Wilkinson G. Advanced Inorganic Chemistry. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988: 1021-1051Google Scholar, 26Nakamoto K. Infrared and Raman Spectra of Inorganic and Coordinated Compounds. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 95-161Google Scholar) or they might be due to two different conformers of the enzyme, each with only one CN− ligand in the active site. Recently, a high resolution crystal structure (1.8 Å) has been published of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Miyazaki (27Higuchi Y. Yagi T. Noritake Y. Structure. 1997; 5: 1671-1680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Although the overall structure of the enzyme and its active site highly resembled the structure of the D. gigas enzyme (3Volbeda A. Garcin E. Piras C. De Lacey A.I. Fernandez V.M. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12989-12996Crossref Scopus (579) Google Scholar), it was concluded that the diatomic ligands at the iron atom were one CO, one CN−, and one SO group. FTIR spectra of this enzyme were very similar to those observed with the C. vinosum andD. gigas enzymes, and this was explained by assuming that the two bands in the 2100–2050 cm−1 region were due to two different conformers of the enzyme (27Higuchi Y. Yagi T. Noritake Y. Structure. 1997; 5: 1671-1680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To verify this possibility in the C. vinosum enzyme, we have also prepared enzyme enriched 49% in 15N. The result is shown in Fig. 4, trace B. For a proper understanding, the spectra of unenriched enzyme (trace A) and fully 15N-enriched enzyme (trace C) are shown in the same figure as well. In case of two conformers of enzyme with one CN− ligand only, a mixture of the spectra inA and C would be expected. This is clearly not the case. Instead, trace B shows two sets of three overlapping bands in the 2100 to 2040 cm−1 region. Two of the three bands in each set are at positions equivalent to those seen in traces A or C. The central band in each set can be visualized by appropriate subtractions (Fig. 4, trace D). The two bands, at 2085 and 2053 cm−1, are somewhat broader than those of the individual bands of the unenriched or fully enriched enzyme. Possible effects of isotope enrichments on the EPR spectra of the nickel center and the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster in the ready or unready form of the C. vinosum enzyme as isolated have been studied as well. The preparations enriched for more than 98% in 13C or 15N did not show any detectable broadening as compared with unenriched enzyme, however. To corroborate the implications of FTIR experiments, analytical procedures for the determination of intrinsic CO and CN− in proteins and in particular hydrogenase have been designed. We encountered several complications. First, release of CO from the C. vinosum[NiFe]-hydrogenase was not observed using a variety of denaturing, aerobic, acid, alkaline, and temperature conditions other than the current anaerobic, neutral pH, SDS (100 °C) procedure. Although the method itself has a high recovery (91%), only up to 0.7 mol of carbon monoxide per mol of nickel was detected (TableII). When Hb-CO samples were used as a control, lower amounts of CO were also found (0.4–0.8 mol/mol Hb). No carbon monoxide evolution was seen in control experiments with other proteins. Second, the release of CN− from hydrogenase was initially corrupted by reaction of acid-released cyanide with sulfur to form non-distillable thiocyanate. The subsequent use of KMnO4 to oxidize SCN− back to CN−led to side reactions with amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine, cystine, and cysteine (18Boxer G.E. Rickards J.C. Arch. Biochem. 1952; 39: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The release of cyanide as a function of the quantities of permanganate, hydrogenase, and the non-cyanide-containing model protein BSA was therefore investigated (Fig. 2). By the use of 0.5–1.0 mg of protein amounts and low (0.05–0.2 mm) KMnO4 concentration-sensitive and specific detection of the cyanide contained in the hydrogenase active site could be achieved. The characteristics of the aspecific generation of cyanide from BSA and hydrogenase above 0.5 mm KMnO4 are so similar that it can be assumed that the cyanide released in the 0–0.2 mm KMnO4 range corresponds to cyanide not generated from amino acid breakdown but from SCN− derived from reaction of CN− with sulfur compounds."

Chem. 1995; 270: 19599-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Most models of HCO3− secretion assume that CFTR and the luminal Cl−/HCO3− anion exchanger (AE) are indirectly coupled. In these models Cl− absorbed by the AE across the luminal membrane is secreted into the lumen by CFTR to support further HCO3− secretion (4Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1478-1498Google Scholar, 15Gray M.A. Winpenny J.P. McAlroy H. Argent B.E. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, if Cl−/HCO3− exchange is unaltered in CF, such a mechanism cannot adequately explain the concomitant acidity of the secreted fluid and the impaired Cl− absorption observed in CF (16Hadorn B. Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Can. Med. Assoc. J. 1968; 98: 377-385PubMed Google Scholar, 17Welsh M.J. Tsui L.-C. Boat T.F. Beaudet A.L. Seriven C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

If Cl−/HCO3− exchange is responsible for the bulk of Cl− absorption and HCO3− secretion and CFTR function is required only for return of Cl− to the lumen, then in CF Cl− absorption should be normal (normal Cl−/HCO3− exchange) and the secreted fluid should be acidic due to the limited supply of luminal Cl−. This is not the case (16Hadorn B. Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Can. Med. Assoc. J. 1968; 98: 377-385PubMed Google Scholar, 17Welsh M.J. Tsui L.-C. Boat T.F. Beaudet A.L. Seriven C.R. Beaudet A.L.

Alternatively, if Cl− reabsorption is singularly impaired in CF, the model predicts that the high Cl− concentration in the luminal fluid should increase HCO3−secretion by AE to produce an alkaline fluid with high Cl−concentration. Again, this is not observed. The observation that the luminal fluid is acidic with high Cl− concentration in CF (16Hadorn B. Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Can. Med. Assoc.

CFTR could regulate the electrogenic, electroneutral, or both components of HCO3− secretion. In the present work, we explored the existence of these regulatory mechanisms in cells stably or transiently expressing wild type (WT) or several mutated CFTR constructs. We report that a cAMP-activated CFTR regulates Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in several experimental systems. Expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane was required for regulation of Cl−/HCO3− exchange, as expression of several folding mutants, including ΔF508, had no effect on Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity. Surprisingly, the Cl− conductive function of CFTR was not required for activation of Cl−/HCO3− exchange. Furthermore, mutations in NBD2 altered regulation of AE activity by CFTR independent of their effect on Cl− channel activity. At very high expression levels, CFTR modified the sensitivity of Cl−/HCO3− exchange to DIDS. The novel finding of regulation of Cl−/HCO3− exchange by CFTR reported here may have important physiological implications and explain, at least in part, the impaired HCO3− secretion in CF. Mock-transfected NIH 3T3 cells or NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with WT or ΔF508 CFTR were kindly provided by Dr. Michael J. Welch (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm glucose (DMEM-HG) and 10% fetal calf serum and plated on a sterile 22 × 40-mm coverslip at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm 2M.G. Lee, J. Y. Choi, L. Xiang, E. Strickland, P. J. Thomas, and S. Muallem, unpublished results. for intracellular pH (pHi) measurements. The pCMVNot6.2 plasmids containing human WT or ΔF508 CFTR cDNA were a generous gift from Dr. Johanna Rommens (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the GeneEditor mutagenesis kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was performed to generate the mutant CFTR in the expression vector pCMVNot6.2. Briefly, mutants were selected based upon the incorporation of a second-site mutation in β-lactamase, which alters its substrate specificity allowing resistance of transformed bacteria to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in addition to ampicillin. Incorporation of the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. The mutagenesis primers were as follows: P205S primer, 5′-CGT GTG GAT CGC TTC TTT GCA AGT GGC-3′; W846term, 5′-GAG CAT ACC AGC AGT GAC TAC ATA GAA CAC ATA CCT TCG ATA TAT TAC-3′; G1247D/G1249E, 5′-GTG GGC CTC TTG GGA AGA ACT GAT TCA GAG AAG AGT ACT TTG TTA TCA GC-3′; K1250M, 5′-CTT GGG AAG AAC TGG ATC AGG GAT GAG TAC TTT GTT ATC AGC-3′; D1370N, 5′-GTA AGG CGA AGA TCT TGC TGC TTA ATG AAC CCA GTG CTC ATT TGG ATC-3′. Transfection-quality plasmid DNA was prepared using reagents supplied by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). HEK 293 cells were maintained in DMEM-HG supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and plated on coverslips. On the following day, WT or mutant CFTR plasmids and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing plasmids (Life Technologies, Inc.) were transfected into 293 cells using the Fugene mammalian transfection kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the mixture of plasmids and Fugene solution (pCMVNot6.2, 1.5 μg; pCMVGFP, 1.5 μg; Fugene, 12 μl) was incubated in 100 μl of DMEM for 30 min before addition to the culture media. The cells were used for immunocytochemistry or pHi measurements 48–72 h after transfection. HEK 293 cells transfected with expressing vectors were stained with a rat polyclonal anti-C-terminal CFTR antibody (Ab) R3194 (19French P.J. van Doorninck J.H. Peters R.H.P.C. Verbeek E. Ameen N.A. Marino C.R. de Jonge H.R. Bijman J. Scholte B.J. J. Clin.

Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R. Kopito R.R. Freedman S. Cotton C. Muallem S. Thomas P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C442-C455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For double-labeling, primary and secondary incubations were repeated with antibodies against the second protein of interest. Images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. The coverslips with cells attached to them were washed once with a Hepes-buffered solution and assembled to form the bottom of perifusion chamber. The Hepes-buffered solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). In the case of 293 cells, the level of transfection was estimated from GFP fluorescence. High GFP-expressing cells were identified by viewing GFP fluorescence at excitation wavelength of 475 nm. GFP fluorescence was recorded and used to compare CFTR expression in different experiments. Subsequently, cells were loaded with BCECF by a 10-min incubation at room temperature in Hepes-buffered solution containing 2.5 μm BCECF-AM. BCECF fluorescence was at least 10-fold higher than the original GFP fluorescence. After BCECF loading the cells were perfused with a HCO3−-buffered solution and pHi was measured by photon counting using the recording setup (PTI Delta Ram, Brunswick, NJ) and the conditions described previously (21Muallem S. Zhang B.-X. Loessberg P.A. Star R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17658-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HCO3−-buffered solution contained (in mm) 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 5 Hepes, 25 NaHCO3 (pH 7.4 with NaOH) and was continuously gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Cl− free solutions were prepared by replacing Cl− with gluconate. When desired 5 μm forskolin was added to the perfusate from a stock solution of 10 mm in Me2SO. BCECF fluorescence was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 490 and 440 nm at a resolution of 2/s. The 490/440 ratios were calibrated intracellularly by perfusing the cells with solutions containing 145 mmKCl, 10 mm Hepes, 5 μm nigericin with pH adjusted to 6.2–7.6, as described previously (13Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The results of multiple experiments were analyzed using paired or non-paired Student's t-test as appropriate. Cl− current was recorded using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (22Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15118) Google Scholar) as described before (23Lee M.G. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were released from culture dishes by a 30-s treatment with trypsin-EDTA, washed twice with DMEM, and placed in a perfusion chamber. Cl− current was isolated by using Cl− as the only permeant ion in the pipette and bath solutions. In all experiments the bath solution contained (in mm) 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (NMDG-Cl), 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with Tris), and the pipette solution contained 140 NMDG-Cl, 5 EGTA, 5 Tris-ATP, 5 MgCl2 and 10 Hepes (pH 7.2 with Tris). All recordings were made at room temperature. Seals of 5–8 gigohms were obtained on the cell surface prior to establishing the whole-cell configuration. Macroscopic currents were recorded using the Axopatch-1B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments). Results were collected at 5 kHz after filtering at 2 kHz. The membrane potential was held at –40 mV to record the inward current. The first set of experiments to study regulation of AE activity by CFTR was performed in NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected and expressing high levels of CFTR protein. This particular model system has been used to extensively characterize the properties of CFTR Cl− channel activity (17Welsh M.J. Tsui L.-C. Boat T.F. Beaudet A.L. Seriven C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3799-3876Google Scholar). Mock-transfected cells of the same parental line were used as controls. Significantly, results identical to mock-transfected cells were obtained in cells stably transfected with ΔF508 CFTR (data not shown). A standard protocol of removal and addition of Cl−to the incubation medium buffered with HCO3− was used to follow Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity. All the changes in pHi reported here were dependent on the presence of HCO3−in the incubation media (data not shown). Fig.1 illustrates the basic observation that CFTR-expressing cells exhibited a forskolin-dependent activation of the AE. Fig. 2 summarizes the results of 5–17 experiments under each condition. Removal of Cl− from the incubation medium of mock-transfected cells resulted in a slow and modest increase in pHi, which was completely reversed on addition of Cl− to the medium. Stimulation of control cells with 5 μm forskolin had no effect on basal level of pHi or the pHi changes observed upon removal and readdition of Cl−. Finally, treating the cells with 0.5 mm DIDS, a blocker of Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity (24Cabantchik Z.I. Greger R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C803-C827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nearly abolished pHi changes resulting from changes in transcellular Cl− concentration. These properties are commonly used to demonstrate Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in cells (13Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Zhao H. Xu X. Diaz J. Muallem S. J. Biol.

CFTR-expressing cells showed marginal statistical difference in Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity under resting conditions when compared with mock-transfected cells (p = 0.11), or cells stably transfected with ΔF508 CFTR (data not shown). Interestingly, Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity observed in resting cells expressing CFTR was inhibited by DIDS to the same extent as that measured in control cells (Fig. 2).Figure 2AE activity in CFTR-stimulated cells.The protocols of Fig. 1 were used to measure the rate and extent of pHi changes due to removal and addition of Cl− to mock transfected or WT CFTR-expressing NIH 3T3 cells before (Con, control) and after stimulation with 5 μm forskolin and before and after treatment with 0.5 mm DIDS. The results of 5–17 experiments were summarized to calculate the mean ± S.E. After forskolin stimulation all pHi changes in WT CFTR-expressing cells were much higher than those in mock transfected cells. Before forskolin stimulation the pHi changes in cells expressing WT CFTR trended to be higher than those in control cells, although the differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.11).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stimulation of CFTR-expressing 3T3 cells with forskolin caused a time-dependent intracellular acidification that was complete after 3 min of incubation at 37 °C. This acidification was observed only in cells expressing CFTR in all experiments tested (n = 17) and was not inhibited by DIDS (n = 9). Furthermore, removal of Cl− from the incubation medium of forskolin-stimulated, CFTR-expressing cells caused a rapid and a large increase in pHi that was reversed upon readdition of Cl− to the medium (Fig.1 b). Fig. 2 shows that after forskolin stimulation the rate of pHi change due to changes in transcellular Cl− gradient in CFTR-expressing cells is 8-fold faster than that before forskolin stimulation in the same cells, or before and after forskolin stimulation in control cells. Thus, the increased rate of pHi changes required both expression of CFTR and activation of the protein by cAMP-dependent mechanisms. It is well established that CFTR-mediated Cl− channel activity is regulated by a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation (2Quinton P.M. The Second Joseph Levy Memorial Lecture. Cystic Fibrosis Trust, Bromley, Kent, UK1994Google Scholar, 7Quinton P.M. Nature. 1983; 301: 421-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 8Anderson M.P. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 251: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The finding that after forskolin stimulation, the pHi changes due to changes in transcellular Cl− gradient are resistant to inhibition by DIDS (Figs.1 b and 2) was unexpected. Since the same NIH 3T3 cell line was used to suggest that CFTR may function as a Cl− and a HCO3−-permeable channel (25Poulsen J.H. Fischer H. Illek B. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5340-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that the pHi changes illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 are due to CFTR functioning as a HCO3− channel. Several lines of evidence indicate that this is not the case. In contrast to Poulsenet al. (25Poulsen J.H. Fischer H. Illek B. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5340-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), in more than 10 experiments, we did not see any effect of HCO3− addition on pHi of forskolin-stimulated acidified NIH 3T3 cells (using the protocol of Fig. 1b in Ref. 25Poulsen J.H. Fischer H. Illek B. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5340-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depolarization of the plasma membrane with 5 mm Ba2+ (n = 5; data not shown), 100 mm K+ (see Fig. 10) or 125 mm K+ (data not shown) had no effect on the changes in pHi observed on removal and addition of Cl− as would be expected is CFTR was functioning as a HCO3− channel. Additional evidence that CFTR conductance was not responsible for the pHichanges in Figs. 1 and 2 is provided by testing the effect of inhibitors of CFTR Cl− channel activity. Fig.3 shows the effect of 100 μm DPC and 100 μm glibenclamide on Cl− channel activity of CFTR-expressing cells. At 100 μm these blockers inhibited CFTR-dependent Cl− current by at least 90% (Fig. 3 c). Notably, these blockers had no effect on the ability of CFTR to stimulate pHi changes upon Cl−removal or addition in a forskolin-dependent manner (Fig.4).Figure 3Stimulation of Cl− current in NIH 3T3 cells expressing WT CFTR. The whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to measure Cl− current in cells internally perfused through the patch pipette and bathed in Na+- and K+-free, NMDG-Cl-containing medium. Cl− current was stimulated by exposing cells to 5 μm forskolin. When the current reached maximal value, the cells were perfused with a solution containing 100 μm DPC (a) or 100 μm glibenclamide (b).Panel c summarizes the results from the indicated number of experiments to give the mean ± S.E. of the current as percentage of the maximal current measured before addition of the drugs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Effect of CFTR Cl− channel inhibition on AE activity. NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with WT CFTR and incubated in HCO3−-buffered media were stimulated with 5 μm forskolin and transiently exposed to Cl−-free medium before and after incubation with 100 μm DPC (a) or 100 μmglibenclamide (b). Similar results were obtained in at least three experiments under each experimental condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The lack of effect imparted by changes in membrane potential and inhibitors of CFTR Cl− channel activity strongly suggested that the pHi changes observed on removal and addition of Cl− are not mediated by an electrogenic pathway. Rather, it appears that expression and stimulation of CFTR by cAMP activated an electroneutral HCO3−transport mechanism. If this pathway transports Cl− in exchange for HCO3−, then the pHi changes should be a function of intracellular Cl− content. Fig.5 shows the protocol used to test this prediction. The cells were first treated with DIDS to prevent the initial changes in pHi due to Cl−removal. Then the cells were incubated in a HCO3−-buffered, Cl−-free medium for 1 min (Fig. 5 a), 60 min (Fig. 5 b), or various times between 5 and 30 min (data not shown) to deplete intracellular Cl−. The cells were then stimulated with forskolin to activate CFTR and, thus, Cl−/HCO3− exchange. Progressive depletion of intracellular Cl− resulted in a graded inhibition of forskolin-activated pHiincrease (Fig. 5). Readdition of Cl− to the incubation medium resulted in a pronounce acidification, as expected from HCO3−i/Cl−oexchange. Removal and readdition of Cl− in these cells showed the expected changes in pHi (Fig. 5). In additional experiments we incubated the cells in a HEPES-buffered, Cl−-free medium for 30–60 min to deplete intracellular Cl−. Such incubations were as effective in inhibiting the effect of forskolin on pHi in the presence of HCO3− as the incubation in HCO3−-buffered, Cl−-free medium shown in Fig. 5 b (data not shown). All the experimental protocols used to identify the HCO3− transporter activated by forskolin in CFTR-expressing 3T3 cells except for the lack of inhibition by DIDS point to a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger. These include (a) requirement for a HCO3− gradient, (b) requirement for a Cl− gradient, (c) independence from Na+o, (see below), (d) electroneutrality, and (e) insensitivity to Cl− channel blockers. A possible explanation for these observations is that high level expression of CFTR in 3T3 cells activated the anion exchanger and modified its sensitivity to DIDS. To test this hypothesis and provide additional evidence for regulation of anion exchange by CFTR, we examined the effect of transient expression of WT and mutant CFTR on anion exchange in HEK 293 cells. To identify the transfected cells and evaluate the extent of protein expression, the cells were co-transfected with GFP and the various CFTR plasmids. Many CFTR mutants, including some used in the present work, are known folding mutants (26Thomas P.J. Qu B.H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 27Wigley W.C. Vijayakumar S. Jones J.D. Slaughter C. Thomas P.J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar) before substantial amount of the protein reaches the plasma membrane. Therefore, we first determined the expression and localization of the CFTR mutants used in the present work. To distinguish plasma membrane and ER localized CFTR, CFTR localization was compared with that of the ER-resident chaperone BiP (29Villa A. Podini P. Clegg D.O. Pozzan T. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fig. 6(a and b) shows that WT CFTR is expressed in the plasma membrane and CFTR expression correlated with expression of GFP. In numerous cells examined, expression of WT CFTR and all mutants correlated very well with expression of GFP. Fig. 6 (e andf) shows the correlation between expression of GFP and ΔF508 CFTR.

Moreover, studies in mice suggest that genetic determinants of asthma-like airway hyperresponsiveness include one or more genes in the vicinity of tryptase loci on chromosome 17 (11Sanctis G.T.D.

Known members of the tryptase family are expressed selectively in mast cells and basophils (12Reynolds D.S. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. J. Biol.

Compared with amounts of granule-associated serine proteases in leukocytes, levels of tryptases in human mast cells are exceptionally high, comprising up to 25% of cellular protein (15Schwartz L.B.

Purified human tryptases exhibit size heterogeneity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and can be chromatographically separated into isoforms which in part may be due to differences in glycosylation (17Little S.S. Johnson D.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on differences in immunoreactivity and in amino acid sequence deduced from cloned cDNAs, known human tryptases divide into two groups, α and β (18Vanderslice P. Ballinger S.M. Tam E.K.

Invest. 1990; 86: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). β-Tryptase appears to be the major type stored in mast cell secretory granules and is the major form isolated from extracts of the richest tissue source, which is the lung (21Harvima I.T.

Res. 1989; 281: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). β-Tryptase mRNAs are also the main types identified in purified mast cells from human lung and skin (22Xia H.-Z. Kepley C.L. Sakai K. Chelliah J. Irani A.-M.A. Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5472-5480PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, by immunoassay, α-tryptase is the major isoform in blood in normal subjects (23Schwartz L.B. Sakai K. Bradford T.R. Ren S.L. Zweiman B. Worobec A.S. Metcalfe D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2702-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and may be the predominant type expressed by basophils (22Xia H.-Z. Kepley C.L. Sakai K. Chelliah J. Irani A.-M.A. Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5472-5480PubMed Google Scholar). The basis for the cell selectivity of tryptase expression and for the exceptionally high expression of β-tryptase in human mast cells is not known. Four different human tryptase cDNAs (α, βI, βII, and βIII) have been generated from human lung (19Miller J.S. Westin E.H. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1188-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Miller J.S. Moxley G. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin.

Ballinger S.M. Tam E.K. Goldstein S.M. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, one or more tryptase genes are expressed in cell lines, including Mono Mac 6 cells (α-tryptase) (24Huang R. Åbrink M. Gobl A.E. Nilsson G. Aveskogh M. Larsson L.G. Nilsson K. Hellman L. Scand. J. Immunol. 1993; 38: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), HMC-1 and U-937 cells (βI-tryptase) (24Huang R. Åbrink M. Gobl A.E. Nilsson G. Aveskogh M. Larsson L.G. Nilsson K. Hellman L. Scand. J. Immunol. 1993; 38: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and KU812 cells (α- and βII-tryptases) (22Xia H.-Z. Kepley C.L. Sakai K. Chelliah J. Irani A.-M.A. Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5472-5480PubMed Google Scholar, 25Blom T. Hellman L. Scand. J. Immunol. 1993; 37: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition to βI-tryptase, HMC-1 cells also transcribe a second very closely related mRNA (here designated βIb-tryptase), whose product is predicted to differ from βI-tryptase itself by one amino acid (26Chan H. Tanaka R. Clark J. FASEB J. 1995; 9 (abstr.): 1343Google Scholar). Because all of the described β-tryptases are 98–99% identical in amino acid sequence, they have been considered to be possible allelic variants of each other (18Vanderslice P. Ballinger S.M. Tam E.K. Goldstein S.M. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 27Caughey G.H. Caughey G.H. Mast Cell Proteases in Immunology and Biology. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 305-329Google Scholar). α-Tryptase is less closely related (91% identical to βI) and is more likely to be a product of a separate gene in the haploid genome (19Miller J.S. Westin E.H. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1188-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Miller J.S. Moxley G. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Both α- and β-tryptases appear to reside on human chromosome 16 based on amplification of DNA from hamster-human hybrid cells (20Miller J.S. Moxley G. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the number and proximity of haploid α- and β-genes as well as their precise chromosomal location and genetic neighbors are not known. In mice, two different tryptases (mMCP-6 and -7) 1The abbreviations used are: mMCP, mouse mast cell protease; YAC, yeast artificial chromosome; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; FISH, fluorescence in situhybridization; UTR, untranslated region; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); contig, group of overlapping clones.1The abbreviations used are: mMCP, mouse mast cell protease; YAC, yeast artificial chromosome; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; FISH, fluorescence in situhybridization; UTR, untranslated region; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); contig, group of overlapping clones. have been identified (12Reynolds D.S. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3847-3853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13McNeil H.P. Reynolds D.S. Schiller V. Ghildyal N. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11174-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Structurally, human α- and β-tryptases are more closely related to each other than to mMCP-6 and -7, which are much more different from each other than any combination of known human tryptases (27Caughey G.H. Caughey G.H. Mast Cell Proteases in Immunology and Biology. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 305-329Google Scholar). These observations suggest 1) that the ancestors of the known human tryptases diverged from each other after the point in evolution when the known mouse and human tryptases shared a common ancestor, 2) that human α- and β-tryptase therefore are not the equivalents, respectively, of mMCP-6 and -7, and 3) that the human genes that are true orthologs of mMCP-6 and -7 may await discovery. The latter possibility is particularly likely to apply to orthologs of mMCP-7, whose gene structure is distinct in several features from that of the cloned human βI-tryptase gene (13McNeil H.P. Reynolds D.S. Schiller V. Ghildyal N. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11174-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Among serine protease genes as well as other extended gene families, differences in intron-exon organization tend to suggest more remote phylogenetic relationships (27Caughey G.H. Caughey G.H. Mast Cell Proteases in Immunology and Biology. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 305-329Google Scholar). In addition to functional data linking tryptases to the pathogenesis of asthma, recent genetic data suggest that chromosome 16 in some populations contains determinants of susceptibility to asthma (28Daniels S.E. Bhattacharrya S. James A. Leaves N.I. Young A. Hill M.R. Faux J.A. Ryan G.F. Souef P.N.L. Lathrop G.M. Musk A.W. Cookson W.O. Nature. 1996; 383: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). In work reported here, to explore a potential link between tryptases and the genetics of asthma, we more precisely localize tryptase genes on chromosome 16, and, to help resolve enigmas concerning the nature and number of haploid human tryptase genes and identify new members of the tryptase family, we characterize a locus of tryptase genes. Human genomic MegaYAC libraries A, B, and C from Center d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (29Cohen D. Chumakov I. Weissenbach J. Nature. 1993; 366: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and a human genomic BAC (30Shizuya H. Birren B. Kim U.J. Mancino V. Slepak T. Tachiiri Y. Simon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8794-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar) library were screened by PCR using sets of oligonucleotide primers spanning various portions of known tryptases cDNAs and genes. When MegaYAC screening with these tryptase-specific primers failed to identify positive clones, the BAC library was screened. The primers that identified two BAC clones and isolated two BAC clones amplify a highly conserved 184-bp region in the 3′-UTR of tryptase genes. This region contains repetitive elements (see Fig. 1). These PCR primers (5′-ccaaaacaccactgcttcct and 5′-ccggtgcaggcgtcaggctt) were used at a final concentration of 200 nm in buffer F from the Optimizer kit (InVitrogen) containing Taq Gold (Perkin-Elmer). Reactions were cycled as follows: 95 °C for 10 min (one cycle); 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s (25 cycles); and 7 min at 72 °C (1 cycle). Products were separated on agarose gels. Full genomic and BAC DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases at 37 °C, size-fractionated on agarose gels, transferred to Hybond N-Plus membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then fixed by UV cross-linking or baking in a vacuum oven. Blots were prehybridized for 1 h at 65 °C in 90 mm sodium citrate buffer containing 0.9 m NaCl, 2.5% SDS, 1 g/liter each of Ficoll 400, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml of sheared salmon sperm DNA and then probed with radiolabeled DNA prepared from full-length human tryptase βIII cDNA (18Vanderslice P. Ballinger S.M. Tam E.K. Goldstein S.M. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) or with aBamHI/AvaII tryptase βI gene fragment containing exon 5 and portions of flanking introns as templates (18Vanderslice P. Ballinger S.M. Tam E.K. Goldstein S.M. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). After labeling, probes were purified on a G-25 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized at 2 × 105 to 1 × 106 cpm/ml. After incubation overnight, blots were washed twice in 30 mm sodium citrate buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl and 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C followed by two washes in 1.5 mm sodium citrate buffer containing 15 mm NaCl and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. Hybridizing bands were revealed by autoradiography. BAC clones identified in the present work and a λ clone containing the tryptase βI gene (18Vanderslice P. Ballinger S.M. Tam E.K. Goldstein S.M. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) identified in prior work were localized to a specific human chromosomal band by standard FISH techniques, as described previously (31Kallioniemi O.P. Kallioniemi A. Kurisu W. Thor A. Chen L.C. Smith H.S. Waldman F.M. Pinkel D. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5321-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Briefly, metaphase spreads of human peripheral blood lymphocytes were denatured in 30 mm sodium citrate buffer containing 0.3m NaCl and 70% formamide for 5 min at 72 °C and then dried in graded solutions of ethanol. BAC and λ probes incorporating digoxigenin-11-dUTP were prepared by nick translation, and a human chromosome 16-specific centromeric probe was labeled directly by incorporating Texas Red dUTP. 10 μl of hybridization mixture contained labeled probes, and Cot-1-digested DNA in 30 mm sodium citrate buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl, 50% formamide, and 10% dextran sulfate were applied to each slide. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, slides were washed to remove unbound probes, incubated with fluorescein-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody, and then counterstained with 0.2 mm4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole to reveal chromosomal bands. The BAC libraries were originally prepared from partial HindIII digests of genomic DNA. To obtain smaller fragments of the BAC inserted genomic sequences, the insertions were completely digested withHindIII, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into pBluescript (SK+) (Stratagene). Briefly, HindIII-digested BAC DNA ligated into pBluescript was electroporated into DH10BEscherichia coli (Life Technologies, Inc.). Bacterial plaques containing cloned tryptase genes were identified by plaque hybridization to labeled tryptase DNA probes. Plasmid DNA from individual clones was purified, digested with HindIII, and compared with the pattern of fragments generated by HindIII digestion of DNA from the parent BAC clones. Relevant portions of tryptase-positive subclones were sequenced by the Biomolecular Resource Center of the University of California at San Francisco using tryptase- or vector-specific oligonucleotide primers. BAC DNA was digested with a variety of endonucleases, including NotI, EcoRI,HindIII, BamHI, BglII,SacII, PstI, AvaII, Msc I, and AluI. When necessary because of the generation of large fragments, restriction digests were separated on a 1% agarose gel via inversed field gel electrophoresis on a CHEF Mapper (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresed DNA was blotted and sequentially probed with tryptase- and BAC insertion end-specific probes. BAC end sequences for each clone were determined by direct sequencing using primers specific for the BAC cloning vector arms. BAC end-specific probes were then generated via PCR, cloned into pCR 3.1, and then sequenced and labeled for use as probes. Because analysis of human tryptase cDNA and gene sequences revealed the presence of nucleotide changes in exon 3, causing differences in susceptibility toSacII digestion, we developed a PCR approach to screen BACs for tryptase genes based on restriction polymorphisms. We generated a 242-bp amplimer bracketing potential SacII restriction sites using the following primers: 5′-caggaggcccccaggagcaagtggc and 5′-ccctgggcagcggaggatcccactc. These primers were used at a concentration of 200 nm in buffer containing Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Reactions were cycled as follows: 95 °C for 5 min (1 cycle); 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 30 s (40 cycles); and then 7 min at 72 °C. Products were separated on agarose gels. Some of the 242-bp amplimers were sequenced after subcloning into pCR 2.1 (InVitrogen) or pBluescript (Stratagene). Matrix plots, multiple sequence alignments, and phylogenetic trees were generated with GeneWorks 2.5.1 (Oxford Molecular). All sequences were also aligned with those in the GenBankTM nonredundant data base and in the expressed sequence tag data base using various BLAST algorithms (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.M. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70353) Google Scholar). Repetitive sequences were identified via matrix plots and by analyzing sequences by RepeatMasker2. 2http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker. In matrix analyses of previously cloned tryptase cDNAs (Fig.1 A), we noted that the 3′-UTR of all human tryptases is highly conserved in a region containing several different repeated sequences (Fig. 1 B) that are present to a much smaller degree in dog tryptase and are inapparent in murine tryptase 3′-UTRs by matrix analysis (not shown). These repeated sequences differ from those reported in mouse chymase (mMCP-1, -2, and -4) 3′-UTRs, which modulate mRNA stability (33Xia Z. Ghildyal N. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8747-8753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the human tryptase 3′-UTR repeats may play a similar role. The portion of the human tryptase 3′-UTR bracketing the repeated sequences is unique to tryptases based on the results of nucleic acid data base searches. PCR primers amplifying the repeat region identified two clones from a BAC library but no clones from a YAC library. To confirm the presence of tryptase-like sequences in the identified BACs, restriction endonuclease-digested BAC DNA was subjected to blotting and probed separately with a full-length tryptase βIII cDNA and with a BamHI/AvaII βI gene fragment containing exon 5 and portions of flanking introns (18Vanderslice P. Ballinger S.M. Tam E.K. Goldstein S.M. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig.2 in comparison with similarly treated blots of human full genomic DNA suggest that both BACs contain more than one tryptase gene. Although the banding patterns of BACs A and B differ, several bands appear identical, suggesting either that the BACs partially overlap or that they contain genes that are sufficiently similar that they yield similar restriction patterns. Together, as shown in Fig. 2, the bands in the two BACs account for all of the bands seen in the full genomic blot, suggesting that the BACs collectively include most or all of the tryptase genes of the genome. By FISH, both BACs, as well as a previously isolated λ phage clone containing the tryptase βI gene (18Vanderslice P. Ballinger S.M. Tam E.K. Goldstein S.M. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), localize to a site near the end of the short arm of chromosome 16 (band 13.3). There is no discernible difference in the location of any of these clones by this technique, suggesting that all map to the same or closely adjacent sites. These data confirm and extend prior data assigning α and β tryptase genes to chromosome 16 using panels of hamster human hybrids (19Miller J.S. Westin E.H. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1188-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Miller J.S. Moxley G. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because no YACs containing tryptase genes were identified, it is likely that the βI-tryptase gene and the identical tryptase-rich BACs map to the small portion of chromosome 16p13.3 that is not “covered” by YACs (34Dogget N.A. Goodwin L.A. Tesmer J.G. Meinke L.J. Bruce D.C. Clark L.M. Altherr M.R. Ford A.A. Chi H.-C. Marrone B.L. Longmire J.L. Lane S.A. Whitmore S.A. Lowenstein M.G. Sutherland R.D. Mundt M.O. Knill E.H. Bruno W.J. Macken C.A. Torney D.C. Wu J.-R. Griffith J. Sutherland G.R. Deaven L.L. Callen D.F. Moyzis R.K. Nature. 1995; 377 (suppl.): 335-365Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, part of the 16p13.3 YAC-poor region is syntenic with a small portion of mouse chromosome 17 containing mMCP-6 and -7 genes (35Gurish M.F. Johnson K.R. Webster M.J. Stevens R.L. Nadeau J.H. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 656-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This region of synteny corresponds to <0.1% of the human genome. By inversed field gel electrophoresis, the BAC A and B insertions are ∼74 and 62 kb, respectively. As shown in Fig.4 A, we developed a completeEcoRI, NotI, and HindIII (and partialBglII) restriction map of both BACs. Double digests of the BACs with NotI and EcoRI generate a similar ∼17.5-kb fragment from both BACs. MultipleHindIII-generated bands also are similar. Furthermore, a probe based on the SP6 end of BAC A hybridizes with a specificHindIII fragment of BAC B and a probe developed from the SP6 end of BAC B hybridizes with a specific small, internalHindIII fragment of BAC A. However, probes prepared from the T7 ends of both BACs hybridize solely with the BAC of origin. BAC A ends in the middle of a 5′ fragment of a tryptase gene, which has a highly similar (but complete) counterpart “mMCP-7-like gene” (see below) in BAC B. Alignment of the two BACs based on restriction maps and cross-hybridizing end sequences and genes (Fig. 4 A) suggest that over half of each BAC is structurally homologous to the other, although the inserted sequences are oriented in opposite directions relative to the SP6 and T7 polymerase sites of the vector. Because the sequences at homologous loci are similar but not identical in the two BACs, despite close organizational parallels, we conclude that BACs A and B are most likely to be partially overlapping sections of sister chromatids and that tryptase genes at homologous sites are allelic variants of each other. BAC A contains a β-tryptase gene whose exons match previously described βII cDNAs. BAC B contains two identified β-like genes whose exons correspond to cDNAs βI and βIII (18Vanderslice P. Ballinger S.M. Tam E.K. Goldstein S.M. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The organization (see Fig. 6 A) of the BAC β genes is identical to that of a previously characterized βI gene (GenBankTM accession number M33494) (18Vanderslice P. Ballinger S.M. Tam E.K. Goldstein S.M. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the BAC B βI gene represents the Glu99 version of tryptase (βIa) rather than the Lys99 version (βIb, which may be another allele at this locus) also transcribed in HMC-1 cells (26Chan H. Tanaka R. Clark J. FASEB J. 1995; 9 (abstr.): 1343Google Scholar). The βIII gene resides at a separate site. The reason for the existence of two loci of highly similar genes is unclear. βIII-Tryptase differs from βIa at only three of 245 catalytic domain amino acids, none of which (based on preliminary modeling) are in sites thought to be critical determinants of function. One potential explanation for the presence of two very similar genes is a recent gene amplification event, perhaps in response to evolutionary pressure to increase production of tryptase mRNA and protein. Related events are observed in connection with other genes. For example, gene amplification is a known genetic adaptation to selective pressure to increase the product of the mammalian dihydrofolate reductase gene and is a mechanism that can occur more readily than regulatory region mutations as a means of increasing transcription (36Ma C. Martin S. Trask B. Hamlin J.L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Another possible explanation is that the duplication of β genes was remote rather than recent and that near identity at the two loci has been maintained by gene conversion (37Kourilsky P. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 60-62Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which is a postulated mechanism for maintaining similarity of tandemly arrayed genes. Intriguingly, the three residues by which βIII differs from βI tryptase are all α-like residues, suggesting that there may have been genetic exchange between β and α genes. Our complete βI and βIII tryptase gene sequences (including 5′ and 3′ flanks) and βII partial sequences, including 3′ flank, are deposited in GenBankTM (AF099144, AF099143, AF099145 and AF099146, respectively). BAC A contains a gene (αII) with an exon sequence similar but not identical to that reported for α cDNA (here designated αI) (19Miller J.S. Westin E.H. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1188-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of αI and II, as shown in Fig.5, differ in only three residues. The alignment shown in Fig. 4 A suggests that the BAC A αII gene and the BAC B βIa gene may be allelic partners, a possibility further supported by the very high homology between the two genes and their respective extended flanking regions, as revealed by the matrix analysis in Fig. 1 A. The gene corresponding to previously reported αI cDNA also may be an allele at this locus or may be the product of another α gene not detected in the BACs. This is the first report of α-tryptase gene structure, which, not surprisingly, is similar to that of β-genes (Fig.6 A), containing a 6-exon, 5-intron pattern, including the placement of a phase-0 intron immediately upstream of the initiator Met codon, which separates the site of transcription initiation from protein coding sequence. This feature is characteristic of tryptases but is unusual in other genes. The α gene described here also has an 11-bp deletion in intron 4 compared with β-tryptase genes. Another difference between α and β genes is the presence of a SacII restriction site in α exon 3 (see Figs. 4 B and 6 A). These differences provide ways to measure α versus β DNA in PCR-generated amplimers containing tryptase gene products of mixed heritage. The predicted protein products of both new α-tryptases in this work contain Gln residues in the −3 position of the propeptide. It has been suggested that this residue impairs α-tryptase activation from its zymogen form by replacing the usual Arg that is present in this position in β-tryptases, rendering the β enzyme amenable to autolytic activation (38Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our complete αII tryptase gene sequence, including 5′ and 3′ flank, is deposited in GenBankTM(AF098328). As noted above, the SP6 end of BAC A contains the 5′ portion of a tryptase gene. This sequence ends at the terminal HindIII site of BAC (the BAC library was generated from HindIII partial digests). BAC B, however, contains the full sequence of the apparent allelic partner of the partial BAC A gene. Although the phase and placement of introns are similar to those of other human tryptase genes (as shown in Fig.6 A), their size varies, particularly in intron 4, which is much larger than the other introns, as is also true of intron 4 in the gene encoding mMCP-7 (13McNeil H.P. Reynolds D.S. Schiller V. Ghildyal N. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11174-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Among the protein-coding sequences, however, only exon 5 closely resembles mMCP-7. The region of nucleotide sequence similarity to mMCP-7 includes all of exon 5 and contiguous portions of introns 4 and 5. However, there is no discernible similarity between most of the large human intron 4 insertion and the intron of similar size in the mMCP-7 gene. The closest matches in searches of the GenBankTM data base (including expressed sequence tags), using exon 5 as the query sequence, are mMCP-7 and the apparent orthologs of mMCP-7 in gerbil (39Murakomo Y. Ide H. Itoh H. Tomita M. Kobayashi T. Maruyama H. Horii Y. Nawa Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and rat (40Lutzelschwab C. Pejler G. Aveskogh M. Hellman L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). No human expressed sequence tags are highly similar. Remarkably, the remaining exons of the mMCP-7-like gene are closely related to α- and β-tryptases. The α-like features include a predicted Gln at the −3 position of the propeptide and a SacII site in exon 3. However, this α/mMCP-7-like gene has a second, novel SacII site in the same exon; it also has a β-like PstI site in exon 6. Finally, a stop codon that is 40 amino acid residues premature relative to that in other tryptase genes is identified. Together, the above findings suggest that this mMCP-7-like gene is a hybrid that may have arisen from one or more homologous recombination events involving α-like genes and the putative ortholog of mMCP-7. The similarity of exons 1–4 to α-tryptase suggests that the formation of this hybrid was recent on the time scale of mammalian evolution. At present, there is no evidence that other exons of the mMCP-7-homologous gene, which may have become lost following unequal crossing over events, persist in the human genome. A dendrogram summarizing the possible phylogenetic relationship between different exons of the α/mMCP-7-like gene is shown in Fig. 6 B, which also suggests that known α- and β-tryptases may be orthologs of another mouse tryptase, mMCP-6. The sequence of the BAC B gene (mMCP-7-like I), encompassing all protein-coding exons and intervening introns, and that of the 5′ portion of the BAC A gene (mMCP-7-like II) up to the HindIII site at the SP6 terminus of the BAC insert, are deposited in GenBankTM (AF099147 and AF098327, respectively). Sequencing of BAC A and B tryptase genes revealed differences in SacII restriction sites in exon 3 (Fig.6 A). Tryptases βI, βII, and βIII have noSacII sites in this region. Therefore, as shown in Fig.4 B, the 242-bp fragment of the gene amplified using the primers described above is unaffected by SacII. The αII gene, however, has a single site, generating two fragments, of which the 113-bp fragment is unique to known α-genes. The mMCP-7-like gene in BAC A has a single SacII site, which differs from the α site and generates fragments of 51 and 191 bp. The mMCP-7-like gene in BAC B has two sites, one the same as the BAC A gene and the other identical to the α-gene site, resulting in 51-, 62-, and 129-bp fragments. Thus, the 51- and 62-bp fragments are characteristic of mMCP-7-like genes. As predicted, based on the genes we characterized, BAC A amplimers restricted with SacII generate fragments of 242, 191, 129, 113, and 51 bp but are missing the 62-bp fragment found only in the BAC B mMCP-7-like tryptase. BAC B, however, has the 51-bp fragment, as well as all of the BAC A fragments. Similar PCR/SacII analysis of individual HindIII BAC subclones from which αII, βI, βII, and βIII genes were obtained identify only the restriction pattern of the gene already identified in the subclone, suggesting that only one type of gene lies within a given subclone. No α-like genes were identified in the BAC B-derived subclones; however, the 113-bp band in the BAC B digest suggests the possible presence of an α-like gene not yet subcloned. PCR of full human genomic DNA yields all of the bands seen in BAC B. Overall, the PCR results suggest that both BACs contain α, β, and mMCP-7-like genes and are consistent with the hypothesis that the BACs contain overlapping portions of the same locus in distinct haploid chromosomes. An alternative, although less likely interpretation is that each BAC contains separate parts of the genome that are highly homologous because of past, large scale duplication. In this work we characterize a cluster of mast cell tryptase genes encoding known as well as previously undescribed members of the family extending over ∼50 kb of chromosome 16p13.3. Our findings establish that in the haploid genome there are at least two α/β tryptase genes that appear to be orthologs of mMCP-6. Homologous positions of αII and βIa genes suggest that one or more α/β pairs may be alleles at the same locus. Additionally, we identify a novel gene with one of six exons being closely related to the mouse tryptase, mMCP-7. Duplication of α/β-like genes, via a gene dosage effect, may contribute to the high levels of tryptase expression in human mast cells. Whether the identified unique 3′-UTR repeated sequences and regulatory sequences flanking the α and β genes contribute to differences in gene transcription and whether “locus control” elements exert more global influence over expression of members of the tryptase gene cluster remain to be determined."

A Xenopus mitotic phosphoprotein, MP90, is very similar to an abundant mammalian nerve terminal protein, epsin, which binds the Eps15 homology (EH) domain of Eps15 and the α-adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor AP-2. We show here that both rat epsin and Eps15 are mitotic phosphoproteins and that their mitotic phosphorylation inhibits binding to the appendage domain of α-adaptin. Both epsin and Eps15, like other cytosolic components of the synaptic vesicle endocytic machinery, undergo constitutive phosphorylation and depolarization-dependent dephosphorylation in nerve terminals. Furthermore, their binding to AP-2 in brain extracts is enhanced by dephosphorylation. Epsin together with Eps15 was proposed to assist the clathrin coat in its dynamic rearrangements during the invagination/fission reactions. Their mitotic phosphorylation may be one of the mechanisms by which the invagination of clathrin-coated pits is blocked in mitosis and their stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation at synapses may contribute to the compensatory burst of endocytosis after a secretory stimulus.

Recent studies have implicated several cytosolic proteins besides clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP-2 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals (1Robinson M.S.

Binding of Eps15 to AP-2 is mediated by its COOH-terminal region (9Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol.

Via these modules, Eps15 binds proteins with the consensus amino sequence NPF (12Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Epsin, which contains three NPF motifs in its COOH-terminal region (NPF domain), is a major binding partner for Eps15 (7Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Its NH2-terminal portion comprises an evolutionary conserved domain of unknown function, the ENTH domain (epsin NH2terminalhomology domain), whereas its central region, which contains eight DPW repeats (DPW domain), binds the appendage domain of α-adaptin at a site that overlaps with the Eps15-binding site (7Chen H.

Perturbation of the interactions of both Eps15 and epsin with AP-2, as well as disruption of the function of both proteins by antibody injection, block clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7Chen H. Fre S.

It was proposed that Eps15 and epsin play an important role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, possibly by participating in dynamic rearrangements of the clathrin coat during bud invagination and fission (7Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 17Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M.

In mitotic cells clathrin coats assemble, but their invagination is impaired (19Pypaert M. Lucocq J.M. Warren G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 45: 23-29PubMed Google Scholar,20Pypaert M. Mundy D. Souter E. Labbe J.C. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The identification of substrates of mitotic kinases responsible for this effect may therefore shed new light on the still elusive mechanisms underlying the invagination reaction. Epsin is highly homologous to the Xenopus mitotic phosphoprotein MP90, which was identified in a screen for substrates of mitotic kinases (21Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and contains a single putative consensus site for Cdc2 kinase, which is conserved in mammalian epsin. These considerations prompted us to investigate whether epsin undergoes mitotic phosphorylation. We report here that both epsin and Eps15 are phosphorylated in mitosis and that their phosphorylation inhibits binding to the clathrin adaptor AP-2. We also report that both epsin and Eps15, like other accessory proteins of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, undergo stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation in nerve terminals (22Robinson P.J.

Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), with a resulting increase in their binding to each other and to AP-2. Their dephosphorylation may facilitate endocytosis of synaptic vesicle membranes following an exocytotic burst. B82 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20% calf serum and 5 mm methotrexate. Antibodies directed against epsin, Eps15, amphiphysin 1, and GST fusion proteins of α-adaptin and the DPW domain of epsin were previously described (7Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Antibody against α-adaptin was purchased from Sigma. B82 mouse fibroblasts were grown to 60–80% confluency and synchronized with 50 ng/ml nocodazole for 4 h. Mitotic cells were collected by detaching rounded up cells. Interphase (G1 phase) cells were obtained by washing away the nocodazole from the mitotic cells, replating cells in fresh medium, and allowing cells to grow for 4 h before harvesting. Particulate and soluble fractions from these cells were obtained as described (7Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cells extracts for affinity purification were prepared by lysing cells in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml antipain, and 1 mm PMSF), and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μm cyclosporin, and 100 nm okadaic acid) for 15 min on ice followed by centrifugation. The mutant DPW domain was obtained by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis. A pair of primers harboring the serine 328 to aspartate mutation were generated: 5′-GACCCTTGGGGAGGTGATCCT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCACCTCCCCAAGGGTC-3′. Using 5′-GACCCTTGGGGAGGTGATCCT-3′ together with 5′-AAACGCGTCGACGTCGAAGTCTGAGAACTCATC-3′ and 5′-AAACCGGAATTCCGGATCCGTCGTGGGGAT-3′ together with 5′-AGGATCACCTCCCCAAGGGTC-3′, two cDNA fragments were obtained and purified by a QIAGEN kit (QIAGEN). These two DNA fragments were used as both primers and templates in a standard polymerase chain reaction to generate a full-length mutant DPW domain, which was subsequently cloned into the PGEX6–1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequence of the mutant DPW domain was confirmed by standard double-strand sequencing. 10 μg of recombinant wild type or mutant DPW domain were obtained from a GST-DPW fusion protein by thrombin (Novagen) cleavage and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 3 nm Xenopusp34cdc2-cyclin B kinase (26Holmes J.K.

The reaction was stopped by addition of a 20-fold excess of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. Brain cytosol was prepared by homogenizing rat brains in 2 volumes of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (3 μg/ml each of aprotinin, antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h, and the resulting supernatant (cytosol) was desalted on Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 120 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 at room temperature. The desalted cytosol was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min either with a general protein kinase inhibitor (K252a) (dephospho-cytosol) or with 5 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate (Sigma), 2 μm cyclosporin (Calbiochem), and 100 nm okadaic acid (Calbiochem) (phospho-cytosol). The incubation was terminated by the addition of 1% SDS, and SDS was then “neutralized” by the addition of 2% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl to achieve a Triton X-100:SDS ratio > 4 (w/w). Immunoprecipitations from B82 cells and brain extracts were performed as described (7Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 27Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). For calf intestinal phosphatase treatment of the immunoprecipitates, immunocomplexes were treated with 100 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (Boheringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 37 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. Treatment with phosphatase inhibitors was performed with 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Affinity purification of brain extracts and experiments on intact synaptosomes were performed as described previously (27Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We investigated whether mammalian epsin undergoes phosphorylation in mitotic cells as predicted by the property of XenopusMP90 to act as a substrate for mitotic kinases (21Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The mitotic phosphorylation of MP90 was shown to lower its mobility in SDS-PAGE (21Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Cell extracts from mitotic and interphase (G1 phase) B82 cells (a mouse fibroblastic cell line) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the mobility of epsin was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown by Fig. 1 A, epsin from mitotic extracts had a slower mobility than epsin from interphase cells. A similar shift was observed for Eps15. A putative Cdc2 phosphorylation site (28Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar) is present in the COOH-terminal region of Eps15 (threonine 779 of mouse Eps15 (8Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar)), which is the α-adaptin-binding region. To confirm that the electrophoretic shifts were due to phosphorylation, epsin and Eps15 were immunoprecipitated from interphase and mitotic cell extracts. The immunoprecipitates obtained from mitotic extracts were then incubated with or without alkaline phosphatase or with both alkaline phosphatase and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture. As shown by Fig. 1 B, incubation with alkaline phosphatase completely reversed the mobility shift due to mitosis, and this effect was blocked by the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Clathrin-coated pits are present in mitotic cells, and the main difference from interphase cells is the predominance of pits with shallow curvature (19Pypaert M. Lucocq J.M. Warren G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 45: 23-29PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pypaert M. Mundy D. Souter E. Labbe J.C. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A block of the invagination reaction may result from a dissociation from the pits of factors that normally assist the coat during its progressive rearrangement. We therefore compared the partitioning of clathrin, epsin, and Eps15 between the soluble and particulate fraction of interphase (G1) and mitotic (M) cells. As shown by Fig.2 A, the fraction of clathrin recovered in the two fractions was similar in both conditions. In contrast, the mitotic phosphorylation of epsin and Eps15 (revealed by their upper mobility shift), correlated with a drastic decrease of their recovery in the particulate fraction. One of the factors responsible for this effect may be a decreased affinity of mitotic epsin and Eps15 for the clathrin adaptor AP-2. To address this question, Triton X-100 extracts of interphase and mitotic B82 cells were affinity-purified onto a GST fusion protein comprising the appendage domain of α-adaptin (Fig. 2 B). Analysis of the bound fraction by Western blotting revealed a major decrease in binding of the mitotic forms of both epsin and Eps15 compared with the binding of the corresponding interphase proteins (Fig. 2 B). Epsin and MP90 contain a single putative phosphorylation site for Cdc2 kinase in the DPW domain (serine 328 of rat epsin) (7Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 21Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To determine whether this site acts as a substrate for the Cdc2 kinase and mediates the inhibition of AP-2 binding in mitosis, a mutant DPW domain of rat epsin was generated harboring a S328D mutation. Purified wild type and mutant DPW domains were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of the purifiedXenopus p34cdc2-cyclin B kinase complex (26Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, a very strong difference was observed in the 32P incorporation of the two proteins, indicating that serine 328 is a key substrate site for the kinase in vitro. Furthermore, affinity purification on the immobilized α-adaptin appendage domain of the32P-labeled wild type DPW domain revealed no binding of the32P-labeled protein, proving that its phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase blocks the interaction (Fig. 3 B). Finally, as shown by Fig. 3 C, affinity purification of a brain cytosolic extract on wild type and mutant DPW domains demonstrated a significant decrease in the binding of α-adaptin to the mutant domain, confirming that the introduction of an acidic charge at position 328 affects the epsin-AP-2 interaction. Stimulation of neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals correlates with an increased state of phosphorylation of several proteins with a putative role in synaptic vesicles exocytosis (29Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) and a decreased state of phosphorylation of several proteins with a putative role in their endocytosis including dynamin 1, synaptojanin 1, and amphiphysin (22Robinson P.J.

Cell. 1997; 10: 2003-2015Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We investigated whether epsin and Eps15 as well undergo dephosphorylation. Fig.4 A shows immunoblots of rat synaptosomes incubated for 1 min in either control buffer or high K+ buffer. A downward shift of epsin in depolarized synaptosomes can be seen. This shift correlates with the concomitant downwards shift of amphiphysin 1 previously shown to reflect its Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation (23Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30984-30992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In control synaptosomes, Eps15 migrated as a doublet. Depolarization resulted in a decreased immunoreactivity on the upper bands with a corresponding increase of the immunoreactivity in the lower band, suggesting that Eps15 as well undergoes depolarization-dependent dephosphorylation. The phosphorylation of amphiphysin, dynamin 1, and synaptojanin 1 in brain extracts inhibits their property to interact with partners proteins implicated in endocytosis (25Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The effect of epsin and Eps15 phosphorylation in brain extracts on their interaction with the AP-2 subunit α-adaptin was therefore investigated. Brain cytosolic extracts were incubated in either phosphorylating or dephosphorylating conditions as described (25Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Western blots of anti-epsin immunoprecipitates generated at the end of these incubations demonstrated an upper mobility shift of epsin in the phosphorylating conditions that could be reversed by treatment of the immunoprecipitates with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 4 B) consistent with the interpretation that the mobility shift of epsin and Eps15 observed in Fig. 4 A is due to dephosphorylation. Aliquots of the phospho- and dephospho-extracts were then incubated with the appendage domain of α-adaptin, and the bound material was analyzed by Western blotting. Quantitation of the blots demonstrated that binding to α-adaptin is inhibited by phosphorylation (Fig.4 C). We next performed immunoprecipitation experiments from these extracts to test the effect of phosphorylation on the endogenous interactions within the cytosolic extract of epsin and Eps15 with AP-2. In both anti-Eps15 and anti-epsin immunoprecipitates coprecipitation of AP-2 was clearly decreased by the previous phosphorylation of the extracts (Fig. 4 D). This result is consistent with an inhibitory effect of the phosphorylation of epsin and Eps15 on their interaction with AP-2, although they do not rule out a contribution of phosphorylation of AP-2 itself to their reduced interaction. The results of this study demonstrate that the interaction of Eps15 and epsin with the α-adaptin subunit of AP-2 is modulated by phosphorylation. Both Eps15 and epsin undergo phosphorylation in mitosis, a stage of the cell cycle where clathrin-mediated endocytosis is blocked (19Pypaert M. Lucocq J.M. Warren G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 45: 23-29PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pypaert M. Mundy D. Souter E. Labbe J.C. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In mitosis, clathrin-coated pits are still present, but early stages of clathrin-coated pits (shallow domes and wide necks) predominate over late stages (narrow neck). This observation led to the speculation that invagination of clathrin-coated pits is a processive reaction and that some proteins that play a key role in this process may be the target of mitotic kinases (19Pypaert M. Lucocq J.M. Warren G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 45: 23-29PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pypaert M. Mundy D. Souter E. Labbe J.C. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Epsin/MP90 and Eps15 may be two such proteins. Both Eps15 and epsin were detected at clathrin-coated pits but were found not to be co-enriched, together with clathrin, in clathrin-coated vesicles (7Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Cupers P. Jadhav A.P. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1847-1850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are accessory and not key intrinsic components of the clathrin coat. The phosphorylation-dependent block of the interaction of epsin and Eps15 with AP-2 may dissociate them from the clathrin coat and play a role in the inhibition of the invagination process. If further studies confirm a role of epsin and Eps15 in the mitotic block of endocytosis, the elucidation of the function of these proteins may be crucial to understand the still elusive mechanism of clathrin-coated pit invagination. Both Eps15 and epsin are also shown here to be regulated phosphoproteins in nerve terminals. They join the list of several other proteins implicated in the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of synaptic vesicles that undergo stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation (22Robinson P.J. Sontag J.M.

Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), it would appear that triggered dephosphorylation, which favors the assembled state of cytosolic endocytic proteins, represents a general and characteristic feature of “endocytic” proteins of nerve terminals. A reduced state of phosphorylation of endocytic proteins may increase the efficiency of the synaptic vesicle membrane internalization reaction. This effect may account for the enhanced rate of endocytosis observed in cultured neurons after incubation with the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (32Klingauf J. Kavalali E.T. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the inhibition of synaptic vesicle endocytosis produced by inhibitors of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (33Marks B. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 740-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Finally, dephosphorylation by a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase may play a role in the block of synaptic vesicle endocytosis produced by depletion of internal Ca2+(34Gad H. Low P. Zotova E. Brodin L.

Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We have found that epsin as well undergoes phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation of fibroblastic cells, although this phosphorylation does not occur on tyrosine residues, indicating an indirect effect of EGF receptor kinase. 2S. Fré, M. R. Capua, H. Chen, P. Di Fiore, and P. De Camilli, unpublished observations. Based on our preliminary experiments, however, the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Eps15 and epsin does not appear to decrease their interaction with AP-2, suggesting that these phosphorylation reactions play a role in cell physiology different from those described in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2030317576,"RhoA has been identified as an important regulator of cell proliferation. We recently showed that the Ras/RhoA pathway regulates the degradation of p27Kip and the progression of Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts (IIC9 cells) through G1 into S phase (Weber, J. D., Hu, W., Jefcoat, S. C., Raben, D. M., and Baldassare, J. J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 32966–32971). In this report, we have demonstrated that, in IIC9 cells, RhoA regulates cyclin E/CDK2 activity, which is required for p27Kip degradation. As previously shown in several fibroblasts cell lines, expression of dominant-negative CDK2 in IIC9 cells blocked serum-induced cyclin E/CDK2 activity and p27Kip degradation. In the absence of serum, expression of constitutively active RhoA(63) resulted in significant stimulation of cyclin E/CDK2 activity and degradation of p27Kip. Cotransfection of dominant-negative CDK2 and RhoA(63) inhibited RhoA(63)-induced cyclin E/CDK2 activity and p27Kipdegradation. In addition, expression of dominant-negative RhoA blocked serum-induced cyclin E/CDK2 activity and p27Kipdegradation. Finally, expression of catalytically active cyclin E/CDK2 rescued the effect of expression of dominant-negative RhoA. Taken together, these data show that RhoA regulates p27Kipdegradation through its regulation of cyclin E/CDK2 activity. RhoA has been identified as an important regulator of cell proliferation. We recently showed that the Ras/RhoA pathway regulates the degradation of p27Kip and the progression of Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts (IIC9 cells) through G1 into S phase (Weber, J.

Cyclin-dependent kinases and their inhibitors are important for ordered progression through the cell cycle (1Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar). Progression through G1 into S phase requires activation of both cyclin D/CDK4 and cyclin E/CDK2 activities (13.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). In addition to the cyclins, specific inhibitory proteins (CKI proteins) associate with distinct cyclin kinase complexes and regulate their activities. These CKI proteins are divided into two families on the basis of sequence homology: the Cip/Kip and Ink4 families. The Cip/Kip family, which includes p21Cip (2Harper J.M. Adami G.R. Wei N.

The Ink4 family, which includes p16, p15, p18, and p19, specifically inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 activities (6Hannon G.J. Beach D.

Consistent with the notion that p27Kip is important in G1 progression, mitogens stimulate elimination of p27Kip during late G1 or as cells enter G1/S. Interestingly, decreases in p27Kipprotein levels are not a result of any changes in mRNA levels (18Hengst L. Reed S.I.

Mutation of Thr-187 to alanine results in a stable form of p27Kip, which is resistant to phosphorylation by cyclin E/CDK2 and degradation (21Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M.

Taken together, these data strongly indicate that inhibition of p27Kipdegradation alone results in elevated levels of p27Kip and inhibition of G1 progression.

In the present study, we show that RhoA-induced activation of cyclin E/CDK2 precedes decreases in p27Kipprotein amounts. This is the first study to demonstrate a requirement for RhoA in the activation of cyclin E/CDK2 activity and clearly identifies a role for RhoA in growth and transformation. IIC9 cells, a subculture of Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts, were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Subconfluent cultures were growth-arrested by incubation for 2 days in serum-free DMEM. Serum-arrested cells were washed twice and equilibrated in basal medium for 30 min prior to the addition of serum. Dominant-negative (dnCDK2) and wild-type CDK2 were the generous gifts Dr. Ed Harlow. Cyclin E was a generous gift from the laboratory of Dr. James Roberts. Dominant-negative RhoA (dnRhoA) and constitutively active RhoA (RhoA(63)) were constructed as described previously by site-directed mutagenesis of Thr to Asn at codon 19 or Gln to Leu at codon 63, respectively (32Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding wild-type CDK2, dnCDK2, wild-type cyclin E, dnRhoA, and RhoA(63) were transfected into subconfluent IIC9 cells using LipofectAMINETMaccording to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following expression of the cDNAs by incubation for 24 h in DMEM plus 10% serum, the cells were serum-arrested by incubation in DMEM for 48 h before agonist stimulation. Transient transfection using LipofectAMINETM resulted in 80–90% expression efficiency as visualized by β-galactosidase staining. Subconfluent (80%) growth-arrested IIC9 cells were stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested at the indicated times after serum addition by scraping into 150 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were briefly sonicated, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cyclin E-CDK2 immune complexes were isolated by incubation with anti-cyclin E antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) plus protein G. After several washes, the cyclin E-CDK2 complexes were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C with histone and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried, and cyclin E/CDK2 activities were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Serum-deprived cell cultures were incubated in the absence or presence of serum or PDGF. At the indicated times, the samples were scraped into 150 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 14,000 × rpm, and then lysed on ice in 30 μl of solubilization buffer (25 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The samples were subjected to brief sonication and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay as recommended by the manufacturer. Typically, 50 μg of lysate protein were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were probed with the appropriate antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia) as recommended by the manufacturer. Recent studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of p27Kip at Thr-187 by cyclin E/CDK2 is required for ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p27Kip (21Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 22Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B.

Commun. 1997; 240: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine whether cyclin E/CDK2 activity precedes serum-induced p27Kip degradation, we examined the time course of p27Kip degradation and cyclin E/CDK2 activity. Serum stimulated a rapid increase in cyclin E/CDK2 activity (Fig. 1 A). Increased activity was detectable within 30 min, was maximal at 17 h, and remained elevated for 24 h (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to cyclin E/CDK2 activity, a change in p27Kip protein was not detectable at 30 min (Fig. 1 B). A significant decrease in p27Kip could be detected at 4 h, and p27Kip was barely detectable at 24 h (Fig.1 B). These data demonstrate that cyclin E/CDK2 activity precedes any detectable decrease in p27KIP. The rapid increase in cyclin E/CDK2 activity was unexpected since, in most cell types, this activity does not increase until late in G1 subsequent to activation of cyclin D/CDK4/CDK6. Previously, we showed that cyclin D/CDK4 activity is not detectable until 1–2 h after the addition of PDGF or serum (33Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), yet cyclin E/CDK4 activity increased within 30 min (Fig. 1 A), indicating that, in IIC9 cells, cyclin E/CDK2 increases prior to a detectable increase in cyclin D/CDK4 activity. The timing of an increase in cyclin E/CDK2 in most cell types in late G1 is likely a result of the dependence of cyclin E expression on cyclin D/CDK4 activity (34Geng Y. Eaton E.N. Picon M. Roberts J.M. Lundberg A.S. Gifford A. Sardet C. Weinberg R.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1173-1180PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the early activation of cyclin E/CDK2 observed with IIC9 cells, we examined whether expression of cyclin E in IIC9 cells was independent of cyclin D/CDK4 (Fig.1 C). Significant amounts of cyclin E were detectable in quiescent IIC9 cells (Fig. 1 C). A modest increase in cyclin E protein was detectable within 4 h, was maximal (1.5–2-fold) at 17 h, and remained elevated for 24 h (Fig. 1 C). Cyclin E is therefore detectable in quiescent IIC9 cells and remains elevated throughout G1 into S phase. The high level of cyclin E, which is expressed in quiescent IIC9 cells, is markedly different from the level of cyclin D1 protein (32Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 33Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 protein is very low but detectable in quiescent IIC9 cells and increases at least 5-fold with PDGF (32Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 33Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Significant levels of cyclin E are present in quiescent cells, and serum stimulates only small increases. These data suggest that there are sufficient amounts of cyclin E in quiescent cells and indicate that the increases in this cyclin E/CDK2 activity occur independent of increased expression of cyclin E. Data obtained from overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of both RhoA and CDK2 indicate that mitogen-induced degradation of p27Kip requires activation of RhoA (32Weber J.D. Hu W.

Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 22Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B.

Commun. 1997; 240: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine whether RhoA regulates cyclin E/CDK2 activity, we next examined the effect of blocking RhoA activation on cyclin E/CDK2 activity and p27Kip protein (Fig. 2). Expression of dnRhoA inhibited serum-stimulated cyclin E/CDK2 activity (Fig. 2 A) as well as p27Kip degradation (Fig.2 B). To further demonstrate that RhoA regulates cyclin E/CDK2 activity, IIC9 cells were treated with botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which specifically ADP-ribosylates RhoA and blocks its function (35Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This treatment significantly inhibited serum activation of cyclin E/CDK2 activity and the serum-induced decrease in p27Kip(data not shown). Our data show that cyclin E levels were significantly elevated in quiescent IIC9 cells (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, expression of dnRhoA inhibited serum-induced cyclin E/CDK2 activity (Fig.2 A) and p27Kip degradation (Fig. 2 B). Previously, we found that PDGF stimulates p27Kipdegradation in the absence of cyclin D expression and cyclin D/CDK4 activity (32Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), suggesting that, in IIC9 cells, RhoA itself regulates the levels of p27Kip. We therefore decided to determine whether expression of a constitutively active mutant of RhoA (RhoA(63)) stimulates cyclin E/CDK2 activity in the absence of agonist (Fig.3 A). Expression of RhoA(63) induced a significant increase in cyclin E/CDK2 activity in the absence of serum (Fig. 3 A). This activity was ∼80% of the maximal activity seen with serum-stimulated IIC9 cells. Although expression of RhoA(63) could induce cyclin E/CDK2 activity in quiescent IIC9 cells, serum stimulated a further increase (∼1.4-fold) in the activity of cyclin E/CDK2 in IIC9 cells expressing RhoA(63) (Fig. 3 A). This increase in activity is consistent with the ability of serum to induce a 2-fold increase in cyclin E (Fig. 1 C). In addition to increasing cyclin E/CDK2 activity and consistent with the notion that cyclin E/CDK2 activity is necessary for p27Kipdegradation, expression of RhoA(63) reduced p27Kip protein to levels comparable to those seen with serum stimulation (Fig.3 B). These data clearly demonstrate that expression of constitutively active RhoA alone can markedly increase cyclin E/CDK2 activity and induce p27Kip degradation. To further examine the ability of RhoA(63) to mediate the loss of p27Kip, we next determined whether coexpression of dnCDK2 with RhoA(63) blocks p27Kip breakdown. In contrast to expression of RhoA(63) alone, coexpression of dnCDK2 and RhoA(63) did not result in increased activity (data not shown) or a decrease in p27Kip protein in quiescent IIC9 cells (Fig. 4). These data are in agreement with the results demonstrating that serum-induced degradation of p27Kip is dependent on cyclin E/CDK2 activity and suggest that cyclin E/CDK2 activity is downstream of RhoA.Figure 4Expression of dnCDK2 blocks RhoA(63)-induced p27Kip degradation. Subconfluent IIC9 cells were transfected with 1 μg of RhoA(63) plus 1 μg of dnCDK2 and growth-arrested as described for Fig. 2. Lysates containing 40 μg of protein were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with anti-p27Kip1 polyclonal antibody. Similar results were obtained in four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined whether expression of cyclin E/CDK2 induces the degradation of p27Kip protein in cells expressing dnRhoA. Expression of cyclin E/CDK2 results in significant cyclin E/CDK2 activity in quiescent IIC9 cells (Fig. 5 A) and loss of p27Kip (Fig. 5 B). These changes occurred in the absence of cyclin D/CDK4 activity (data not shown). Therefore, up-regulation of cyclin E/CDK2 activity itself induced p27Kip degradation. To determine whether up-regulation of cyclin E/CDK2 activity rescues the effects of dnRhoA, we examined cyclin E/CDK2 activity and p27Kip levels in cells cotransfected with dnRhoA and cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig.6). Cyclin E/CDK2 activity was markedly increased in cells overexpressing dnRhoA and cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig.6 A). Furthermore, p27Kip levels were reduced in these cells (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that RhoA is upstream of cyclin E/CDK2.Figure 6Expression of cyclin E/CDK2 rescues dnRhoA-dependent inhibition of p27Kipdegradation. Subconfluent IIC9 cells were transfected with dnRhoA alone or dnRhoA plus cyclin E/CDK2 and then growth-arrested as described for Fig. 2. Lysates were prepared from quiescent cells or from cells stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum for 17 h.A, cyclin E immune complexes were isolated from lysates containing 50 μg of protein and assayed for their ability to phosphorylate histone protein (Histone-P) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Similar results were obtained in four separate experiments. B, lysates (40 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with anti-p27Kip1 antibody. Similar results were obtained in four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of RhoA by expression of dnRhoA or treatment with botulinum C3 exoenzyme resulted in significant inhibition of growth (Fig. 7 A). This is consistent with the observation that RhoA is important in mammalian cell growth and transformation (26Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 27Yamamoto M. Marui N. Sakai T. Morii N. Kozaki S. Ikai K. Imamura S. Narumiya S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1449-1455PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that RhoA regulates cell cycle progression at least partially through its regulation of cyclin E/CDK2 activity and p27Kip levels. If cyclin E/CDK2 activity is the major cell cycle downstream effector, cotransfection of cyclin E/CDK2 should rescue the arrest observed with expression of dnRhoA. Indeed, serum stimulated significant growth in IIC9 cells expressing dnRhoA and cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig. 7 A). In IIC9 cells coexpressing dnRhoA and cyclin E/CDK2, serum was less mitogenic than in wild-type IIC9 cells (Fig. 7 A). However, growth under these conditions was virtually identical to growth in the presence of a potent mitogen, PDGF (Fig. 7 B), indicating that cyclin E/CDK2 activation is a target for RhoA-dependent regulation of cell cycle progression through G1 into S phase. Whereas expression of dnRhoA could block PDGF-stimulated growth, overexpression of cyclin E/CDK2 rescued growth to near identical values seen in cells treated with PDGF alone (Fig.7 B). These data demonstrate that cyclin E/CDK2 activity is a major target of RhoA. Observations from several independent studies suggest that oncogenic Ras may mediate its action through both Raf-dependent and RhoA-dependent pathways (29Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar,31Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Expression of constitutively active Ras results in transformation in NIH-3T3 cells; expression of constitutively active Raf or RhoA alone only weakly transforms NIH-3T3 cells (29Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cotransfection with either dominant-negative Rac or RhoA blocks Ras-induced transformation (29Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that the Ras/Raf/mitogen-dependent protein kinase pathway is important for the induction of cyclin D and that RhoA regulates p27Kip degradation (32Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 33Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that RhoA induces p27Kipdegradation through regulation of cyclin E/CDK2 activity. Our data therefore indicate that the Ras/Erk pathway regulates cyclin D/CDK4/CDK6 activity and that the Ras/RhoA pathway regulates cyclin E/CDK2 activity. Both these activities are crucial for passage through G1 into S phase (Fig. 8). Several recent reports (21Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 22Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 23Morisaki H. Fujimoto A. Ando A. Nagata Y. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the data in this paper clearly demonstrate that mitogen-induced p27Kip degradation is dependent on cyclin E/CDK2 activity. Previously, we found that, in IIC9 cells, PDGF stimulates p27Kip degradation in the absence of cyclin D/CDK4/CDK6 activity (38.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). This is likely a result of the high level of cyclin E expressed in quiescent IIC9 cells (Fig.1 C). Interestingly, progression through G1 in these cells still requires cyclin D expression, suggesting that, in cells containing normal levels of retinoblastoma protein, 2W. Hu, C. J. Bellone, and J. J. Baldassare, unpublished data. progression through G1 requires both cyclin D- and cyclin E-dependent kinases. These results are in agreement with data that indicate that retinoblastoma protein must be phosphorylated by cyclin D-dependent kinases prior to cyclin E/CDK2 (37LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). How RhoA regulates cyclin E/CDK2 activity is still an open question. Olson et al. (36Olson M. Paterson H. Marshall C. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) found that RhoA blocks the induction of p21Cip1, which is an inhibitor of cyclin/CDK activity and an adapter protein for assembly of D cyclins with their respective CDK proteins (37LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). Microinjection of constitutively active Ras into NIH-3T3 cells in the absence of active RhoA induces p21Cip1expression and does not stimulate DNA synthesis (36Olson M. Paterson H. Marshall C. Nature. 1998; 394: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of active RhoA, p21Cip1 expression is repressed, and cells enter S phase and synthesize DNA. More important, in cells from transgenic mice nullizygous for the gene encoding p21Cip1, active RhoA is not required for Ras-induced DNA synthesis, suggesting that the suppression of p21Cip1 is the only role of RhoA in Ras-induced DNA synthesis. Although this is an intriguing suggestion for the role of RhoA, it does not likely account for our results and therefore is not the only function for RhoA in progression through G1. Ras-induced p21Cip1induction is likely a result of activation of the Ras/Erk pathway (39Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosh E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). This suggests that Ras stimulates cyclin D and p21Cip1expression. Previously, we showed that the Ras/Rho (but not the Ras/Erk) pathway is required for PDGF-induced p27Kipdegradation (32Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The data in this paper clearly show that RhoA stimulates p27Kip degradation by activation of cyclin E/CDK2. This occurs in the absence of Erk activation2 and likely in the absence of p21Cip1 expression. These distinct roles of RhoA in G1 progression may possibly be determined by careful analysis of RhoA protein with mutations of the effector-binding sites and therefore await further investigation. Oddly, p27Kip is an inhibitor and substrate of cyclin E/CDK2. Phosphorylation of p27Kip by cyclin E/CDK2 is required for its degradation in G1 (21Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In vitro kinetic analysis of the association of p27Kipwith cyclin E/CDK2 suggests that p27Kip binds to cyclin E/CDK2 with high and low affinities (21Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Initially, it binds with low affinity, and then slowly, the binding shifts to high affinity (21Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when it binds with low affinity, it is a substrate, and at high affinity, an inhibitor (21Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). At equilibrium, p27Kipinhibits the activity. It is possible that, in vivo, certain conditions favor high or low affinity binding and thus determine whether it is a substrate or inhibitor. RhoA may be an important regulator of this association. The present data clearly demonstrate that RhoA regulates cyclin E/CDK2 activation and identify a role for RhoA in progression through G1 of the cell cycle.

The trypomastigote form of Trypanosoma cruzi, which is the invasive form of the parasite for vertebrates and elicits in humans an ailment known as Chagas' disease, has to overcome a formidable barrier in order to migrate from blood vessels, where they circulate, to the interior of the cells cytoplasm where they differentiate to the replicative amastigote forms (1Zingales B.

They exist only in the invasive trypomastigote form and are absent from epimastigotes, the insect form of the parasite that is unable to invade vertebrate cells. These glycoproteins, collectively called Tc-85, form a population of heterogeneous GPI 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ABTS, 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate(6)] diammonium salt crystals; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; kb, kilobase pair(s); LBG, laminin-binding glycoprotein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ABTS, 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate(6)] diammonium salt crystals; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; kb, kilobase pair(s); LBG, laminin-binding glycoprotein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.-anchored surface glycoproteins with similar molecular masses but different electric charges (13Katzin A.M.

Involvement of one or more of these family members with adhesion and/or internalization of the parasite to host cells is indicated by the observation that monoclonal antibody H1A10 (mAbH1A10), which recognizes and defines the Tc-85 glycoproteins, partially inhibits invasion of the host cell by the parasite in vitro (15Abuin G.

A trypomastigote specific surface 85 kDa glycoprotein, which binds to laminin-Sepharose (LBG, laminin-binding glycoprotein) and belongs to the most acidic components of the Tc-85 glycoprotein family, was reported as the putative laminin receptor (17Giordano R. Chammas R. Veiga S.S. Colli W. Alves M.J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Anti-laminin antibodies also partially inhibit host cell invasion by trypomastigotes and laminin binds to the surface of the parasite in a specific and saturable manner, suggesting that it may be involved in the infection process (17Giordano R.

The present work describes the cloning of a full-length cDNA encoding a polypeptide recognized by mAbH1A10 with the expected properties of the LBG, thus showing that at least one of the Tc-85 family members is an adhesion protein to a defined ligand. The corresponding cDNA insert has significant sequence identity with members of the gp85/trans-sialidase gene family of T. cruzi(23Colli W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Cross G.A.M. Takle G.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 46: 385-411Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 25Schenkman S. Eichinger D. Pereira M.E.A. Nussenzweig V. Annu. Rev.

Clone 3, isolated from theT. cruzi Peru strain by micromanipulation, was utilized for these studies. Growth and maintenance are described elsewhere (26Beard C.A. Wrightsman R.A. Manning J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Properties and cloning conditions for the mAbH1A10 are as reported (15Abuin G. Colli W. de Souza W. Alves M.J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 35: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,16Alves M.J.M. Abuin G. Kuwajima V.Y. Colli W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Parasite nuclear DNA, bacterial plasmid DNA, and phage DNA were isolated as described previously (27Beard C.A. Wrightsman R.A. Manning J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 28: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA, Southern and Northern transfers, hybridization, and filter washing were performed as described previously (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA restriction fragments were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation. All restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and used as recommended. A genomic DNA expression library constructed in phage λgt11 using DNA isolated from trypomastigotes was screened with the mAbH1A10 as described below for Western blot analysis. A cDNA library constructed in λ ZAP II using trypomastigote poly(A)+ RNA was screened with Tc85-1 following PCR radiolabeling of the insert in Bluescript (Stratagene, Inc.) using the KS and SK primers as described below. The insert from the λgt11 clone identified by reaction with mAbH1A10 (Tc85-1) was isolated by digestion with EcoRI and gel electrophoresis. The insert was excised from the gel, purified, and subcloned into the plasmid Bluescript for sequencing and pGEX-1 for expression inEscherichia coli cells (29Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The recombinant Tc85-1 protein described in the text was obtained from a construct of the Tc85-1 insert subcloned as AvaI/EcoRI fragments into the polyhistidine fusion protein expression vector pTrcHis-B (Invitrogen, Inc.) and expressed and purified as described by the manufacturer. The fragment was generated by PCR with the original subclone in Bluescript using the KS primer of the vector as the 3′ primer and a clone-specific primer, which introduced and AvaI site at the 5′ end of the insert (5′-GAATTCCCCTCGAGCGAGAAAAC). The Tc85-11 insert was subcloned into the plasmids Bluescript and pUC19 for sequencing and as aBamHI/XhoI fragment into the polyhistidine fusion vector pET21 (Novagen, Inc.) for expression and purification of protein. The BamHI/XhoI insert was obtained by PCR with two synthetic oligonucleotides to introduce the restriction enzyme sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (5′-CTTGGATCCACGACCGCTCAGG and 5′-GACACCTCGAGCGCAGTAGCAAGGGCCCAC). The Tc85-11 fusion protein was purified from inclusion bodies prepared as described (30Williams J.A. Langeland J.A. Thalley B.S. Skeath J.B. Carroll S.B. Glover D.M. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning 2, Expression Systems, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995: 15-58Google Scholar). The fusion protein was solubilized in 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, and 6 mguanidine (overnight at room temperature). The extract was clarified by centrifugation (30,000 × g for 30 min), applied to a Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), and purified as described by the manufacturer. About 500 μg of purified protein were obtained from 3 liters of E. coli culture. The presence of the purified protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with mAbH1A10 and T7.Tag (Invitrogen, Inc.). The latter reacts with the 10 amino acids coded for by the pET21 vector, which are fused with the amino-terminal portion of the fusion protein. PCR was carried out using Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in a DNA Thermal Cycler, according to a standard protocol (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Test reactions were conducted to optimize template DNA, MgCl2, and dNTP amounts. PCR radiolabeling was performed by substituting the non-radioactive dCTP by 30 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP in a 30-cycle reaction after optimization of the template and MgCl2 concentrations. PCR products were purified using Spin Bind units (FMC BioProducts) as recommended. Protein samples were subjected to one-dimensional PAGE and either stained or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described (16Alves M.J.M. Abuin G. Kuwajima V.Y. Colli W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Western blot reactions were carried out by blocking the membranes with TBS-Tween (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with 3% non-fat dry milk. Incubations with the first antibody were always overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.03% Tween 20, and 0.05% Triton X-100. After washing three times for 5 min with TBS-Tween the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse 125I-labeled, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at 4 °C in TBS-Tween supplemented with 3% non-fat dry milk, washed again as before, and exposed to x-ray film. DNA sequencing was performed by dideoxy chain termination (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed on DNA fragments subcloned into Bluescript using [α-35S]dATP for incorporation and either the KS and SK primers of Bluescript or with oligonucleotides synthesized from sequence data; on the 5′ end of Tc85-1 subcloned in the expression vector pGEX-1 using a primer synthesized from sequences upstream of the glutathione S-transferase cloning site; and on both 5′ and 3′ ends of subclones in the pTrcHis expression vector with primers based upon sequences upstream and downstream of the multiple cloning site of the vector. Nucleotide sequence data were compiled and analyzed using the IBI Pustell Sequence Analysis programs for the IBM computer. Peptides were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 430A Synthesizer using ABI-fastmocTM chemistry cycles. Peptides were cleaved from the resin using 90% trifluoroacetic acid and a scavenger. Cleaved peptides were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, precipitated in cold ether, and the precipitate collected by centrifugation. Peptides were dried under nitrogen and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography over a Vydac-C18 column (1.0 × 25 cm) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile. Peptides were eluted from the column with a gradient of acetonitrile (0–100%) over 100 min at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 210 nm. Microtiter wells were coated with Tc85-1 fusion protein (50 μl of a 10 μg/ml solution in PBS (PBS = 140 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3)) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and quenched with blocking buffer (0.25% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. All peptides were prepared as 20 mm stock solutions in Me2SO. Coated microtiter wells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of a 2 mm solution of individual peptides in PBS + 10% Me2SO containing mAbH1A10 (10 ng/ml), washed with PBS, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature, again PBS-washed, and developed with ABTS (Boehringer Mannhein). For direct binding of mAbH1A10, microtiter wells were coated overnight at room temperature with 50 μl of a 100 μg/ml solution of each of the individual peptides in either 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, or 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0. The wells were washed, quenched with blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature, and incubated with mAbH1A10 in blocking buffer (1 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed with PBS as before and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and developed with ABTS. E. coli BL21 DE3 pPlysS cells were transformed with the pET21-Tc85-11 construct and the cells grown on LBCC (Luria broth medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml carbenicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol) agar overnight at 37 °C/200 rpm. Several colonies were grown on 40 ml of LBCC medium untilA 595 nm ∼0.5. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g/10 min at 4 °C), washed once with minimal M9 medium, resuspended in 40 ml of the same medium supplemented with a mixture of 18 amino acids, except methionine and cysteine (25–50 μg/ml each), and further cultured for 1 h at 37 °C/200 rpm. Induction was made with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 10 min, followed by the addition of rifampicin (200 μg/ml) and incubation at 42 °C in a water bath for 20 min. At this point 500 μCi of [35S]methionine were added, and the cells were grown for another 10 min at 37 °C/200 rpm, harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g/10 min at 4 °C), lysed by the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml lysozyme, and 1 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride andN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone), and further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The bacterial extract was clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 15 min), diluted with PBS-1.5% BSA (final concentration), and incubated with cells or extracellular matrix proteins. Proteins were incubated on 24-well plates (100 μl of 50 μg/ml in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and blocked with PBS-3% BSA for 2 h, followed by the addition of the bacterial extract, as described below. LLC-MK2 cells were grown overnight in 24-well plate (105 cells/well), washed with PBS, fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and blocked with 10 mm Tris, pH 7,5, 150 mm NaCl (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were blocked with PBS-3% BSA for 2 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with the clarified cell extract containing 1.5% BSA in PBS, washed with PBS, and the radioactivity bound to the cell or to extracellular matrix proteins was eluted with 100 μl of 1% SDS. The radioactivity was determined in a 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitate of a 20-μl aliquot, and the remaining eluate (80 μl) was concentrated on Speed-Vac and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by exposure to x-ray film. Wells of microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of purified Tc85-11 protein (10 μg/ml in PBS supplemented with 8 m urea) for 2 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, blocked with PBS-1% BSA (2 h at room temperature), and incubated with increasing amounts of laminin in TCMM (TCMM = 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2)-1% BSA (overnight at 4 °C). The wells were washed, incubated for 2 h at room temperature with anti-laminin rabbit serum, washed again, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit sera for 1 h at room temperature, and developed withortho-phenylenediamine (Sigma). Laminin was purified from Engelbreath-Holm-Swarm tumor, as described (17Giordano R. Chammas R. Veiga S.S. Colli W. Alves M.J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A genomic DNA library constructed in λgt11 was screened with the mAbH1A10 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and one positive clone, named λH3.3, was selected. Restriction enzyme mapping analysis of the genomic DNA insert, from now on designated as Tc85-1, revealed a 0.4-kb insert whose complementary strands have been sequenced. Translation of either complementary strand of Tc85-1 resulted in a complete open reading frame. To identify which strand encoded the epitope recognized by mAbH1A10, the Tc85-1 was subcloned into pGEX-1 plasmid, and two bacterial cell lines containing the insert in opposite orientations were selected, grown, and induced. Western blot analysis showed that only one of the two orientations produced a 40-kDa protein recognized by mAbH1A10 (Fig. 1 B). The nucleotide sequence of Tc85-1, with the conceptual amino acid translation, is shown in Fig. 1 A. To determine whether Tc85-1 encodes a polypeptide that could represent a portion of an 85-kDa trypomastigote-specific protein, the insert was subcloned into the pTrcHis vector, expressed in E. coli, and the fusion protein was enriched by affinity chromatography. Sera from immunized mice with the fusion protein were employed to develop Western blots containing epimastigote and trypomastigote lysates, as well as the fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 2, only the fusion protein and an 85-kDa trypomastigote-specific protein were recognized. This result is identical to that observed with mAbH1A10 and suggests that the Tc85-1 insert encodes a portion of an 85-kDa protein recognized by mAbH1A10. A sequence identity search of the GenBankTM data base with the Tc85-1 sequence revealed a high percentual identity with all reported members of the gp85/trans-sialidase gene family (23Colli W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Cross G.A.M. Takle G.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 46: 385-411Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Those with the highest percent identity were genes encoding trypomastigote-specific surface glycoproteins ofM r 85,000–110,000 (Fig.3). Consistent with the GenBankTM search and the Western blot results, the Tc85-1 insert hybridized with trypomastigote, but not epimastigote, poly(A)+ RNA of length 3.7 kb as well as with a large number of different size restriction fragments of a genomic Southern blot containing EcoRI- and BamHI-digested genomic DNA (data not shown). A trypomastigote cDNA library constructed in λ ZAP II was screened with the Tc85-1 insert, and the clones that contained a full-length cDNA of size >2 kb encoding the mAbH1A10 epitope were selected, restricted, subcloned into the pTrcHis vector, and expressed inE. coli. One clone, named Tc85-11, encoded an expression product that reacted positive with mAbH1A10 by Western blot and was selected for this work. The whole coding region of the Tc85-11 gene was sequenced in both of the complementary strands by ExoIII/S1 nuclease partial digestion (Fig. 4). As expected, the DNA sequence has significant identity with Tc85-1 (89%; 118 identical amino acids out of 132) and with several previously described members of the gp85/trans-sialidase supergene family. Northern blot analysis shows that the Tc85-11 insert hybridizes to a 3.7-kb trypomastigote stage mRNA but not to epimastigote or LLC-MK2 mRNA, as expected (Fig.5 A). Chromosome mapping resulted in hybridization of the Tc85-11 insert with 15 out of 20 chromosome bands of the CL Brener clone genome (Fig. 5 B) (32Cano M.I. Gruber A. Vazquez M. Cortes A. Levin M.J.

The presence ofN-glycosylation and GPI anchor insertion sites is in accordance with previous observations showing that Tc-85 is a GPI-anchored membrane glycoprotein (33Couto A.S. Lederkremer R.M.

Parasitol. 1990; 39: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Tc85-11 polypeptide has 12 putativeN-glycosylation sites as well as two signal peptides, one at the amino-terminal portion of the molecule, which directs the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum, and the other at the carboxyl-terminal portion for anchor insertion (shown in Fig. 4). Peptides of length 15 amino acids, which overlap in sequence by 5 amino acids and span the Tc85-1 polypeptide, were synthesized and used to map the mAbH1A10 binding site by a competitive inhibition assay (Fig.6 A). Microtiter wells coated with the Tc85-1 fusion protein were incubated with mAbH1A10 in the presence of individual peptides, and inhibition of binding of mAbH1A10 to Tc85-1 was measured by ELISA. Only peptide G significantly inhibited the ability of the monoclonal antibody to react with Tc85-1, indicating that the epitope is contained within this 15-amino acid sequence (Fig. 6 B). The same result was achieved when the peptides were immobilized and the direct binding of mAbH1A10 determined by ELISA. Only peptide G promoted the binding of mAbH1A10 in a reproducible and specific manner (data not shown). As shown in Fig.6 C, inhibition of the binding of mAbH1A10 to Tc85-1 by peptide G is clearly concentration-dependent, while peptide F shows no inhibition of binding of mAbH1A10 within the concentration range of 0.1 to 1.5 mm. Comparison of both Tc85-1 and Tc85-11 encoded peptides show that only peptides A, F, and G are 100% identical in both sequences. Peptides E and H have only one amino acid change at their ends when both sequences are compared (Fig.6 D). The peptide G sequence is contained in the most conserved region of both proteins, and as shown in Fig. 6 C, only peptide G, but not peptide F, inhibits mAbH1A10 binding. Our result suggests that the peptide G-containing region is involved with mAbH1A10 binding to Tc-85, and its position in the whole protein is indicated in Fig. 4. Tc-85 is possibly involved in the process of invasion of host cells by the parasite. To verify whether the protein encoded by the Tc85-11 gene binds to the host cell, the coding sequence of the gene was subcloned (minus the first 26 amino acids comprising the amino-terminal signal peptide) into the pET21 vector, and the reco"

https://openalex.org/W2012878242,"We have cloned a Na+-dependent, high affinity dicarboxylate transporter (NaDC3) from rat placenta. NaDC3 exhibits 48% identity in amino acid sequence with rat NaDC1, a Na+-dependent, low affinity dicarboxylate transporter. NaDC3-specific mRNA is detectable in kidney, brain, liver, and placenta. When expressed in mammalian cells, NaDC3 mediates Na+-dependent transport of succinate with aK t of 2 μm. The transport function of NaDC3 shows a sigmoidal relationship with regard to Na+concentration, with a Hill coefficient of 2.7. NaDC3 accepts a number of dicarboxylates including dimethylsuccinate as substrates and excludes monocarboxylates. Li+ inhibits NaDC3 in the presence of Na+. Transport of succinate by NaDC3 is markedly influenced by pH, the transport function gradually decreasing when pH is acidified from 8.0 to 5.5. In contrast, the influence of pH on NaDC3-mediated transport of citrate is biphasic in which a pH change from 8.0 to 6.5 stimulates the transport and any further acidification inhibits the transport. In addition, the potency of citrate to compete with NaDC3-mediated transport of succinate increases 25-fold when pH is changed from 7.5 to 5.5. These data show that NaDC3 interacts preferentially with the divalent anionic species of citrate. This represents the first report on the cloning and functional characterization of a mammalian Na+-dependent, high affinity dicarboxylate transporter.

Placenta plays an obligatory role in providing the developing fetus with essential nutrients and metabolic fuels (1Smith C.H. Moe A.J. Ganapathy V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Trophoblast Res. 1998; 11: 243-257Google Scholar). This function is facilitated by the presence of specific transport mechanisms in the maternal facing brush border membrane and the fetal facing basal membrane of the placental syncytiotrophoblast. Several years ago, studies from our laboratory demonstrated the existence of a Na+-coupled transport system for dicarboxylates in brush border membrane vesicles prepared from human term placenta (3Ganapathy V. Ganapathy M.E. Tiruppathi C. Miyamoto Y. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This transport system accepts succinate and other Krebs cycle intermediates as substrates. The functional characteristics of the placental sodium/dicarboxylate transporter are distinct from those of the sodium/dicarboxylate transporter described in brush border membrane vesicles from mammalian kidney and intestine. The primary distinction is in substrate affinity. The transporter in the placental brush border membrane recognizes succinate with high affinity (K t∼5 μm). In contrast, the transporter in the renal and intestinal brush border membranes exhibits relatively much lower affinity (K t ∼100–500 μm) for succinate (4Kippen I. Hirayama B. Klinenberg J.R.

However, a high affinity sodium/dicarboxylate transporter, similar to the one expressed in the placental brush border membrane, is present in the renal basolateral membrane (9Burckhardt G. Pfluegers Arch. 1984; 401: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J.

Acta. 1996; 1309: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This transporter has been designated as either NaDC1 (Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter 1) or SDCT1 (sodium/dicarboxylate transporter 1). We refer to this transporter as NaDC1 throughout this paper. The amino acid sequence of NaDC1 exhibits 78% identity between rabbit and human homologs (13Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar). The rat NaDC1 shows ∼70% identity with rabbit and human NaDC1 (15Chen X.Z. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tian W. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Sekine T. Cha S.H. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Watanabe N. Furuta Y. Fukuda K. Igarashi T. Endou H. Am.

Rabbit NaDC1 and human NaDC1 interact with succinate with a K t value of around 400 μm (13Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, rat NaDC1 exhibits aK t value of 25–30 μm for succinate (15Chen X.Z. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tian W. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Sekine T. Cha S.H. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Watanabe N. Furuta Y. Fukuda K. Igarashi T. Endou H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F298-F305PubMed Google Scholar), and the observed significant divergence in the amino acid sequence of rat NaDC1 in comparison with rabbit NaDC1 and human NaDC1 is likely to be related to the difference in the substrate affinity between rat NaDC1 and rabbit/human NaDC1. Recently a nonmammalian low affinity sodium/dicarboxylate transporter has been cloned from the intestine of Xenopus laevis (18Bai L. Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G267-G274PubMed Google Scholar). Cation specificity and tissue distribution of this transporter clearly differentiate it from mammalian NaDC1. Based on these differences, the X. laevissodium/dicarboxylate transporter has been designated NaDC2. TheK t value for succinate for the X. laevistransporter is in the range of 300–700 μm, depending on whether Na+ or Li+ is used as the cotransported cation. The amphibian NaDC2 may be a species-specific isoform of the mammalian NaDC1. There is no information available in the literature on the molecular nature of the high affinity sodium/dicarboxylate transporter. We report here on the cloning and functional characterization of a high affinity sodium/dicarboxylate transporter NaDC3 from rat placenta. This transporter, when heterologously expressed in mammalian cells, mediates the transport of succinate with a K t value of 2 μm. The rat NaDC3 is 48% identical to rat NaDC1 in amino acid sequence. Northern blot analysis indicates that NaDC3 transcript is also present in the brain, in addition to placenta, kidney, and liver, the tissues in which the existence of a high affinity sodium/dicarboxylate transporter has been demonstrated by functional studies. This represents the first report on the molecular nature of a mammalian high affinity sodium/dicarboxylate transporter.

A. Del Monte (Department of Ophthalmology, W. K. Kellogg Eye Center, Ann Arbor, MI). The cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml of penicillin and 100 units/ml of streptomycin. [2,3- 3H]Succinic acid (specific radioactivity, 37.5 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA), and [14C]citrate (specific radioactivity, 65 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). [α-32P]dCTP and Ready-to-go oligolabeling kit were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rat multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased from OriGene Technologies Inc. (Rockville, MD). All compounds used in the inhibition studies were procured from Sigma. This was done by colony screening of the plasmid cDNA library grown on NitroPure transfer membranes as described by Vogeli and Kaytes (19Vogeli G. Kaytes P.S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe used for screening was 1.8 kilobase pairs long and consisted of almost the entire coding region and some of the 3′-untranslated region (nucleotides 105–1953 of human NaDC1) (14Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the ready-to-go oligolabeling kit and used to screen a rat placental cDNA library (20Prasad P.D. Wang H. Kekuda R. Fujita T. Fei Y.J. Devoe L.D.

Sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method was performed by Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing with an automated Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems 377 Prism DNA Sequencer. Data base searches were done using the commercially available program GenBankTM (22Benson D.A. Boguski M. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Tissue distribution of the NaDC3-specific transcripts was determined by Northern analysis. A commercially available membrane blot containing size-fractionated mRNA (2 μg each) from brain, heart, kidney, stomach, small intestine, and skeletal muscle of rat was used for this purpose. A second blot containing mRNA from rat placenta and liver was prepared in our laboratory. A BamHI–EcoRI fragment (∼2.0 kilobase pairs) consisting of most of the open reading frame of the rNaDC3 cDNA was used as the probe. To detect the presence of NaDC3 transcripts in rat placenta and in rat liver, RT-PCR was done with poly(A)+ RNA isolated from these tissues. The primers used were 5′-GGCTTCCACCGCAATGAT-3′ (upstream primer) and 5′-TGAAGGCGTAGGAACAGC-3′ (downstream primer). These primers corresponded to nucleotide positions 465–482 and 1571–1588, respectively, in the rNaDC3 cDNA. The expected size of the PCR product is 1124 bp. This sequence in rNaDC3 cDNA possesses a single restriction site each for DraIII and NcoI. Restriction analysis of the RT-PCR products was done by subjecting the purified RT-PCR products (Qiaex II, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) to digestion with DraIII or NcoI and analyzing the size of the resulting fragments. The sizes of the expected fragments are 368 and 756 bp in the case of DraIII digestion and 251 and 873 bp in the case of NcoI digestion. The cDNA was functionally expressed in HRPE cells by vaccinia virus expression system (23Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Prasad P.D. Wang H. Kekuda R. Fujita T. Fei Y.J. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

HRPE cells were used instead of HeLa cells because they had lesser endogenous succinate transport activity (data not shown). Transport measurements were made at room temperature using [3H]succinate or [14C]citrate. In most experiments, the incubation time for transport measurements was 1 min to represent initial uptake rates. Since the uptake rates for [14C]citrate were much less than the uptake rates for [3H]succinate, a 10-min incubation was used instead of a 1-min incubation to measure [14C]citrate uptake. Transport was terminated by aspiration of the uptake buffer followed by two rapid washes with 2 ml of ice-cold transport buffer. Following this, the cells were solubilized with 0.5 ml of 1% SDS in 0.2 n NaOH and transferred to vials for quantitation of the radioactivity associated with the cells. The transport buffer was 25 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.5), supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mmMgSO4, and 5 mm glucose in most of the measurements. In experiments dealing with the anion dependence of succinate transport, the composition of the transport buffer was modified by substituting potassium gluconate for KCl and calcium gluconate for CaCl2. When the influence of Na+on succinate transport was being investigated, the buffers containing 140 mm NaCl or 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) chloride were mixed to give uptake buffers of desired Na+ composition. When the influence of pH on transport was investigated, transport buffers of different pH values were prepared by varying the concentration of Tris, Hepes, and Mes. Uptake measurements were made in duplicate and each experiment was repeated two or three times with separate transfections. Results are given as means ± S.D. of these replicate values. Kinetic analyses were carried out by nonlinear as well as linear regression methods using the commercially available computer programs Fig.P, version 6.0 (Cambridge, UK) or Sigma Plot (Chicago, IL). The cloned cDNA is 3239 bp long and has an open reading frame of 1803 bp including the termination codon. The open reading frame is flanked by a 30-bp-long 5′-noncoding sequence and 1406-bp-long 3′-noncoding sequence. The putative initiation codon is preceded by a Kozak consensus sequence (GCGCGG) (24Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). At the 3′-end, the cDNA has two polyadenylation signals in tandem (AATAAATAAA) preceding the poly(A) tail. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 600 amino acids (Fig.1). The protein has an estimated core molecular mass of 66.1 kDa and a pI of 8.09. Hydropathy analysis of the primary amino acid sequence using the Kyte-Doolittle method (25Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) with a window size of 20 amino acids shows that the protein is highly hydrophobic with 12 putative transmembrane domains (Fig.2). Two potential sites (NX(T/S)) for N-linked glycosylation are present at positions 584 and 594. When rat NaDC3 is modeled to accommodate these N-glycosylation sites toward the extracytoplasmic side, both the N-terminal and the C-terminal ends of the protein are directed toward the extracellular side of the cell membrane. This is, however, only a hypothetical model, and further experimentation is needed to confirm the exact number of transmembrane domains and the orientation of the N and C termini and the loops between the transmembrane domains. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of rat NaDC3 with the protein sequences in the SwissProt sequence data base revealed that NaDC3 bears significant homology to the known sodium-dependent dicarboxylate and sodium-dependent sulfate transporters (13Pajor A.M.

The closest relative, rat NaDC1, has a sequence similarity of 71% and identity of 48% at the level of amino acid sequence (Fig. 1).Figure 2Hydropathy plot of rNaDC3 using the Kyte-Doolittle method with a window size of 20 amino acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Poly(A)+RNA isolated from several tissues of rat was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization for the presence of mRNA transcripts of NaDC3 (Fig.3). In the Northern blot obtained commercially, transcripts were detected in brain and kidney (Fig.3 A). mRNA from heart, stomach, small intestine, and skeletal muscle did not show any hybridization signal. The size of the primary transcript was 3.3 kilobases. An additional minor hybridizing transcript of 5.4 kilobases was also seen in both the positive tissues. In the second blot with mRNA from placenta and liver, although NaDC3-specific transcripts of 3.3 kilobases were detected in both placenta and liver, the hybridization signal obtained from placental mRNA was very weak. The hybridization signal in the mRNA from liver was comparable with that obtained in the mRNA from brain (data not shown). Since the cDNA was isolated from a rat placental cDNA library, RT-PCR was performed on mRNA isolated from rat placental tissue to conclusively prove the presence of NaDC3-specific mRNA in the placenta. Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from liver was used as a positive control, and reaction in which reverse transcriptase was omitted was used as negative control. As seen in Fig.3 B, an RT-PCR product of the expected size (1124 bp) was obtained with mRNA isolated from the rat placenta as well as liver. The identity of the RT-PCR product was confirmed by restriction analysis using the enzymes DraIII and NcoI as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The restriction fragments obtained from the RT-PCR products are of the expected size (Fig.3 C), confirming that NaDC3 is expressed in rat placenta. The functional expression of the NaDC3 cDNA was done in HRPE cells by transient transfection followed by vaccinia virus-induced expression of the cDNA. The function was monitored by the transport of radiolabeled succinate. Fig.4 shows the time course of the uptake of succinate by HRPE cells transfected with vector alone or NaDC3 cDNA. Na+-dependent uptake of succinate in control cells transfected with empty vector showed negligible transport, indicating that HRPE cells themselves do not have significant levels of NaDC3-like transport activity. Under these conditions, the uptake of succinate in NaDC3 cDNA-transfected cells was 75–100-fold higher. The uptake of succinate in the absence of extracellular Na+ in HRPE cells expressing NaDC3 was similar to the levels of Na+-dependent uptake measured in cells transfected with empty vector. These results clearly demonstrate that NaDC3 is a sodium-dependent succinate transporter. Since the NaDC3-mediated Na+-dependent uptake of succinate linearly increased at least up to 3 min, subsequent initial transport rate measurements were made using a 1-min incubation period. The ionic dependence of the cDNA-stimulated succinate uptake was investigated by measuring succinate transport in the presence of various inorganic salts (Table I). Control uptake was measured in the presence of NaCl. Replacement of Na+ with equimolar concentrations of cations such as K+, choline, or NMDG almost completely (∼99%) inhibited the succinate uptake, indicating that Na+ is essential for the transport function. Replacement of Na+ with Li+ decreased the uptake markedly, but there was, however, significant residual uptake of succinate, indicating that Li+ can substitute for Na+ to a small extent. When Cl− in the uptake buffer was replaced with F−, I−, SCN−, or NO3−, the initial uptake rate of [3H]succinate was inhibited only marginally, suggesting the noninvolvement of the anion in the transport process. This anion independence is typical of transporters belonging to the sodium-dependent glucose transporter family (27Wright E.M. Hirayama B. Hazama A. Loo D.D. Supplisson S. Turk E. Hager K.M. Soc.

When the influence of anions was studied, KCl and CaCl2 in the buffer were replaced with potassium gluconate and calcium gluconate, respectively. After incubation, the cells were washed with the respective buffer (ice-cold), and the radioactivity associated with the cells was quantitated. Open table in a new tab Subconfluent HRPE cells seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates were transfected with NaDC3 cDNA. Transfected cells were incubated with 250 nm succinate (50 nm radiolabeled succinate plus 200 nm unlabeled succinate) for 1 min either in the control buffer (25 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mm glucose, and 140 mm NaCl) or in buffer in which NaCl was replaced with 140 mm of various inorganic salts. When the influence of anions was studied, KCl and CaCl2 in the buffer were replaced with potassium gluconate and calcium gluconate, respectively. After incubation, the cells were washed with the respective buffer (ice-cold), and the radioactivity associated with the cells was quantitated. Substrate saturation kinetics of the cloned NaDC3 were analyzed in cDNA-transfected HRPE cells (Fig. 5). The initial uptake rate of succinate was measured at varying concentrations of succinate in the uptake buffer (0.5–15 μm). The concentration of [3H]succinate was kept constant at 50 nm. The data obtained were analyzed first by nonlinear regression analysis (Fig. 5) and confirmed by linear regression (Fig. 5, inset). The cDNA-induced transport of succinate was saturable. The experimental values were found to fit best to a transport model consisting of a single transport system. The values for the kinetic constants, K t (Michaelis-Menten constant) andV max (maximal velocity), for the uptake of succinate in cDNA-transfected cells are 2.0 ± 0.1 μm and 115 ± 6 pmol/106 cells/min, respectively. The effect of Na+ on the uptake of succinate was investigated by measuring the uptake of succinate in HRPE cells transfected with NaDC3 cDNA in the presence of varying concentrations of extracellular Na+. The concentration of NaCl in the extracellular medium was varied from 0 to 75 mm. The relationship between the uptake rate and the Na+ concentration was sigmoidal (Fig.6), suggesting the involvement of more than one Na+ per succinate molecule transported. The data were fit to the Hill equation, and the Hill co-efficient, which is the number of Na+ ions interacting with the carrier, was calculated. The value, determined from the slope of the Hill plot (Fig.6, inset) was 2.7 ± 0.2. This indicates that for every succinate molecule transported, three Na+ ions are cotransported. Since succinate is a divalent anion at physiological pH, one extra positive charge enters the cell with every succinate molecule, thereby rendering the transport process rheogenic. The rheogenic nature of the transport process is supported by the findings that K+-induced depolarization of the cells inhibit the transport function of NaDC3. Transport of succinate (20 nm) in cells exposed to a physiological concentration of K+(5.6 mm) was 6.5 ± 0.4 pmol/106cells/min, whereas this transport was reduced 32% to 4.4 ± 0.2 pmol/106 cells/min in cells exposed to 56 mmK+. Thus, both the Na+ gradient as well as the difference in the membrane potential across the cell membrane energize the transport process. The substrate specificity of the transporter was evaluated by assessing the ability of various unlabeled mono-, di-, and tricarboxylic compounds to inhibit the transport of labeled succinate in cDNA-transfected HRPE cells (TableII). Monocarboxylates lactate and pyruvate showed very little inhibition of [3H]succinate uptake, indicating that monocarboxylates are not substrates. The two- and three-carbon chain dicarboxylates oxalate and malonate also were poor inhibitors, suggesting that the length of the carbon chain plays a crucial role in substrate recognition. Dicarboxylates of four- and five-carbon chain length (e.g. succinate, fumarate, and glutarate) markedly inhibited the uptake of radiolabeled succinate, indicating that these are the most ideal substrates recognized by the transporter. The transporter is also able to distinguish betweentrans and cis isomers of unsaturated dicarboxylates. Fumarate (a trans isomer) was able to inhibit totally (∼99%) the uptake of [3H]succinate, whereas the corresponding cis isomer, maleate, caused significantly much lesser inhibition (∼25%). Malate and α-ketoglutarate also inhibited the uptake of radiolabeled succinate very potently, indicating that the presence of a hydroxyl group or a keto group on the α-carbon atom does not interfere with the ability to interact with the transporter. Similarly, dimethylsuccinate and dimercaptosuccinate were also potent inhibitors of succinate uptake, indicating that substitution at the second and third carbon atoms in the succinate molecule with methyl or thiol groups does not abolish the interaction with the transporter. Dipicolinate, on the other hand exhibited a very small but significant ability to inhibit succinate uptake. Citrate, which is predominantly trivalent at pH 7.5, also inhibited succinate uptake by 60%. While the amino acid aspartate inhibited succinate uptake significantly (∼60%), glutamate had no effect.Table IISubstrate specificity of NaDC3Substrate analogSuccinate uptakePercentage of controlfmol/106 cells/min%Control788 ± 41100Lactate768 ± 3898Pyruvate584 ± 3574Oxalate732 ± 5693Malonate630 ± 3980Succinate12 ± 42Fumarate8 ± 11Maleate596 ± 2176Malate13 ± 12Glutarate11 ± 11α-Ketoglutarate9 ± 11Dimethylsuccinate15 ± 42Dimercaptosuccinate245 ± 3331Dipicolinate675 ± 5486Citrate320 ± 1241Aspartate292 ± 137Glutamate844 ± 71107HRPE cells were transfected with NaDC3 cDNA.

https://openalex.org/W1992025923,"The kinetics of xanthine oxidase has been investigated with the aim of addressing several outstanding questions concerning the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. Steady-state and rapid kinetic studies with the substrate 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde demonstrated that (k cat/K m)appand k red/K d exhibit comparable bell-shaped pH dependence with pK avalues of 6.4 ± 0.2 and 8.4 ± 0.2, with the lower pK a assigned to an active-site residue of xanthine oxidase (possibly Glu-1261, by analogy to Glu-869 in the crystallographically known aldehyde oxidase from Desulfovibrio gigas) and the higher pK a to substrate. Early steps in the catalytic sequence have been investigated by following the reaction of the oxidized enzyme with a second aldehyde substrate, 2-aminopteridine-6-aldehyde. The absence of a well defined acid limb in this pH profile and other data indicate that this complex represents anE ox·S rather thanE red·P complex (i.e. no chemistry requiring the active-site base has taken place in forming the long wavelength-absorbing complex seen with this substrate). It appears that xanthine oxidase (and by inference, the closely related aldehyde oxidases) hydroxylates both aromatic heterocycles and aldehydes by a mechanism involving base-assisted catalysis. Single-turnover experiments following incorporation of 17O into the molybdenum center of the enzyme demonstrated that a single oxygen atom is incorporated at a site that gives rise to strong hyperfine coupling to the unpaired electron spin of the metal in the MoVoxidation state. By analogy to the hyperfine interactions seen in a homologous series of molybdenum model compounds, we conclude that this strongly coupled, catalytically labile site represents a metal-coordinated hydroxide rather than the Mo=O group and that this Mo–OH represents the oxygen that is incorporated into product in the course of catalysis.

Xanthine oxidase from cow's milk is a homodimer with a molecular mass of 300 kDa, with each catalytically independent subunit possessing four prosthetic groups: one molybdenum center, one FAD, and two Fe2S2(Cys)4 iron-sulfur centers. Physiologically, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidative hydroxylation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and the subsequent hydroxylation of xanthine to uric acid, the final two steps of purine metabolism in mammals. Substrate hydroxylation takes place at the molybdenum center of the enzyme, which becomes reduced from MoVI to MoIVin the process (1Bray R.C. Palmer G. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2667-2676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reducing equivalents introduced at the molybdenum center are subsequently passed via intramolecular electron transfer to the flavin center, where reaction with O2 takes place to give peroxide or superoxide, depending on the level of enzyme reduction (2Komai H. Massey V. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1692-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Porras A.G. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9096-9103Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Xanthine oxidase exhibits an unusually broad specificity toward reducing substrates. It can hydroxylate a wide variety of purines, pteridines, and related aromatic heterocycles and also a range of both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, taking these to the corresponding carboxylic acid. Indeed, xanthine oxidase belongs to the same family of mononuclear molybdenum enzymes (the molybdenum hydroxylases) as do the aldehyde oxidases. These enzymes have similar cofactor constitutions and amino acid sequences and also have substantially overlapping specificity for reducing substrates (4Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). The specificity of xanthine oxidase toward aldehyde substrates has been examined by Morpeth (5Morpeth F.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 744: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who has found that biogenic aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, indole-3-aldehyde, pyridine-2-aldehyde, etc. are reasonable substrates for the enzyme. To investigate the mechanism of aldehyde hydroxylation by xanthine oxidase and related molybdenum hydroxylases, the reaction of the enzyme with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and 2-aminopteridine-6-aldehyde (PTA) 1The abbreviations used are: PTA, 2-aminopteridine-6-aldehyde; G, gauss; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EPSS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. has been examined. The pH dependence of the kinetics for these reactions indicates that, as with purine hydroxylation, hydroxylation of aldehyde substrates takes place via a base-catalyzed mechanism and substrate must be protonated for hydroxylation to occur. The reaction catalyzed by the molybdenum hydroxylases is unusual in comparison with that of other biological hydroxylation systems in that water rather than dioxygen is the ultimate source of the oxygen atom incorporated into product (4Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar), and the reaction generates rather than consumes reducing equivalents. Although the oxygen atom incorporated into product is ultimately derived from water, it has been known for some time that the proximal oxygen atom donor is a catalytically labile site on the enzyme, which, in the course of a single turnover, transfers its oxygen to substrate, to be regenerated subsequently by oxygen derived from solvent prior to a second turnover (6Hille R. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10914-10917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

More recently, it has been suggested that the catalytically labile site might instead be a metal-coordinated hydroxide (17Greenwood R.J. Wilson G.L. Pilbrow J.R. Wedd A.G. J. Am. Chem.

Given the crystallographic demonstration that water/hydroxide is a ligand to the active-site metal in this family of molybdenum-containing enzymes (19Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I.

LeGall J. Engh R. Schneider M. Hof P. Huber R. Science. 1995; 270: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), this mechanistic possibility must be considered. Alternate mechanisms in which either the Mo=O or Mo–OH group represents the catalytically labile oxygen have been considered (4Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar) and are shown in Scheme FS1. The initial MoIVO(SH)(OR) intermediate of the catalytic sequence (21McWhirter R.B. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23724-23731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be arrived at either by proton abstraction from C-8 of substrate (this site is quite acidic for a carbon acid, with a pK a of ∼14 (22Lister J.H. Brown D.J. The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds: Fused pyrimidines. Part II, Purines. Wiley-Interscience, New York1971: 203-267Google Scholar)) followed by nucleophilic attack on the electron-deficient MoVI=O unit (Scheme FS1 A) or by base-assisted nucleophilic attack on C-8 of substrate by the metal-bound hydroxide (C-8 has also been shown to be susceptible to nucleophilic attack (23Skibo E.B. Gilchrist J.H. Lee C.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3032-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) followed by hydride transfer from C-8 to the Mo=S group (Scheme FS1 B). In this work, we present evidence that the oxygen incorporated into substrate in the course of the hydroxylation chemistry is derived from the Mo–OH moiety of the molybdenum coordination sphere rather than Mo=O, with the implication that the chemistry proceeds via the mechanism that is shown in Scheme FS1 B. Xanthine oxidase was isolated from unpasteurized cow's milk according to previously described methods (24Kim J.H. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was stored in liquid nitrogen in 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.3 mm EDTA and 1.0 mm sodium salicylate until needed, the salicylate being removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 prior to use. UV-visible absorption spectra and routine enzyme assays were performed with a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array spectrophotometer interfaced to a Hewlett-Packard Chemstation computer. Stopped-flow experiments were performed with a Kinetic Instruments stopped-flow apparatus equipped with an OLIS data collection system. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were obtained at 150 K with a Brüker ER 300 spectrometer equipped with an ER 035M NMR gauss meter and a Hewlett-Packard 5352B microwave frequency counter. Modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 2 G, sweep width of 400 G (from 3200 to 3600 G), and 10-milliwatt power were the standard instrument parameters for data acquisition. Simulations were performed using a software package developed by Dr. Graham George (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory), running on a DEC Alpha workstation under OpenVMS. Pre-steady-state kinetic studies of xanthine oxidase with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and 2-aminopteridine-6-aldehyde were carried out under anaerobic conditions at 10 and 25 °C, respectively. The former reaction was monitored at 460 nm following the bleaching of the flavin and iron-sulfur centers that occurs upon reduction of the enzyme by substrate. The latter reaction was monitored at 620 nm following the absorbance increase associated with formation of the oxidized enzyme-substrate complex. These experiments were performed by making the enzyme in appropriate buffer anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with pure argon for at least 1.5 h in a tonometer. Solutions of substrate were made anaerobic by dilution of fresh stocks (PTA dissolved in diluted KOH and 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde in double-distilled H2O) into the appropriate buffer and bubbling the solutions with O2-free argon for at least 15 min. Reversed-phase HPLC separation of 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was carried out using a Beckman HPLC system equipped with an ODS Hypersil 200 × 46-mm column (5-μm pore size; Hewlett-Packard), eluting with a degassed 70% methanol and 30% double-distilled water mixture as the mobile phase; the flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the eluate was monitored at 350 nm. The product of the enzyme reaction with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde was obtained by incubation of the enzyme with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde for 1.5 h, followed by centrifugation through a 50-kDa cutoff membrane to remove the enzyme and dilution with 70:30 (v/v) MeOH/H2O. Samples were analyzed by the HPLC system and compared with authentic 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid to verify the product of the enzyme reaction. The pK a values for 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and PTA were independently determined spectrophotometrically. The protonated (neutral) form of 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde exhibits a maximum absorbance at 358 nm, which shifts upon deprotonation to 410 nm. The pK a was obtained by fitting the absorbance at 410 nm as a function of pH to the equation A = (A HA·[H+] +A A−·K a)/([H+] + K a), where A HA is the absorbance of protonated substrate, A A−is the absorbance of the deprotonated form, and K ais the acid dissociation constant. The absorption spectrum of PTA is also pH-dependent, exhibiting absorbance maxima at 280 and 370 nm at high pH, shifting upon deprotonation to 312 nm. The pK a value for PTA was obtained as described above following this absorbance change. Steady-state kinetic measurements with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde as substrate were performed from pH 5.5 to 9.4 at 25 °C following the absorbance increase at 320 nm for the conversion of the aldehyde to the corresponding acid. Since both the substrate and product exhibit pH-dependent spectra, it was necessary to independently determine the extinction change for oxidation at each pH. The Δε values at 320 nm ranged from 2.8 mm−1cm−1 at pH 5.5 to 4.0 mm−1cm−1 at pH 9.4. The concentration of functional enzyme active sites ranged from 13 to 26 nm in these experiments, and the substrate concentration ranged from 20 to 2000 μm, corresponding to a range at least between 0.3 and 3 times the K m values at each pH. The observed catalytic velocities were fit to the standard hyperbolic equation (Equation 1), where each term has its conventional definition. y[E]=kcat·[S]Km+[S]Equation 1 pH profiles were fit by Kaleidagraph software using Equation 2for a single-ionization process or Equation 3 for double ionization. (klim/Kd)obs=(klim/Kd)max⋅KaKa+[H]Equation 2 (klim/Kd)obs=(klim/Kd)max1+[H]/K1+K2/[H]Equation 3 In these equations, K a represents the dissociation constant for enzyme or substrate, andK 1 and K 2 represent the true acid dissociation constants for a double-ionization process (E ⇄ EH+ ⇄EH22+), where only the ionization state EH+ is catalytically active. In the application of Equation 3 to the reductive half-reaction with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde,k lim/K d is substituted fork cat/K m. 2-Aminopteridine-6-aldehyde, 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were purchased from Aldrich; all other reagents were from Sigma. The following buffers were utilized in this work: 0.1 m MES, pH 5.5–6.5; 0.1 m MOPS, pH 6.75–7.7; 0.1 m EPPS, pH 8.0–8.5; and 0.1 mCHES, pH 9.0–9.4. Each buffer was supplemented with 0.3 mmEDTA and 0.1 n KCl. All reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. H217O (49% enriched) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Enzyme in H217O was prepared by lyophilization of an enzyme sample in 0.1 m pyrophosphate, pH 8.5, to dryness and taking up in an appropriate volume of labeled water. Enzyme in labeled solvent was used within 5 min of preparation to avoid noncatalytic exchange of label into the molybdenum center of the oxidized enzyme. As a preliminary to a steady-state kinetic analysis, the effectiveness of 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde as substrate for xanthine oxidase was examined. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde was found to be efficiently oxidized to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, as indicated by a UV-visible spectral comparison of the reaction product with authentic 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. HPLC was also performed with the product obtained after reaction of the enzyme with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde for 1.5 h. The retention time of the product thus obtained (1.38 min) was the same as that of authentic 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid under the experimental conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). No substrate peak was seen after 1.5 h of reaction, indicating that xanthine oxidase quantitatively converts 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, as expected given the favorable driving force for the reaction. Steady-state measurements of the xanthine oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde were carried out at 25 °C, monitoring product formation at 320 nm. 2In these experiments, the buffer was air-equilibrated with an O2 concentration of ∼240 μm at each pH. We note that the K d for O2 is not very pH-dependent and that theK d changes by only a factor of 2 over the pH range (25Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4350-4362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a small difference in K d as a function of pH should not affect much of the kinetics observed. In theory, for a two-substrate reaction with a ping-pong mechanism, when one substrate concentration is fixed,k cat/K m should not be affected, although the apparent k cat andK m values for the other substrate are different from the true k cat and K m values. In fact, there is good agreement on pH dependence between steady-state and reductive half-reaction results (see below). By contrast with the behavior seen with xanthine, no obvious excess substrate inhibition was observed with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde even at the highest concentrations used (ranging from 2 mm at pH 9.4 to 560 μm at pH 7). The apparentk cat and K m values obtained by hyperbolic fits to the steady-state kinetic data are listed in TableI. Fig. 1shows the pH dependence of the kinetic parameter (k cat/K m)app,which reflects the effective second-order rate constant for the reaction of free substrate with free enzyme in the low substrate concentration regime. These data describe a bell-shaped curve, which can be fitted using a double-ionization equation (see “Materials and Methods”) to yield two pK a values that govern catalysis. The lower pK a of 6.3 ± 0.1 obtained from this analysis agrees well with that determined previously for an active-site residue essential in the hydroxylation of xanthine and lumazine (2,4-dihydroxypteridine) by xanthine oxidase (pK a ∼ 6.5). The higher pK a of 8.6 ± 0.1 from this work agrees well with that of the substrate 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, which has been independently determined spectrophotometrically (pK a = 8.4) (Fig. 1,inset) and by acid-base titration (pK a8.5) (data not shown). The implication is that it is the neutral rather than the ionized form of substrate that is acted upon by the enzyme. The overall pH dependence of the reaction is comparable to that of enzymatic action on both xanthine and lumazine (26Kim J.H. Ryan M.G. Knaut H. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6771-6780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting strongly that xanthine oxidase hydroxylates aromatic heterocycles and aldehydes by the same principal mechanism, one involving base-assisted catalysis on an unionized (neutral) substrate.Table IKinetic parameters for xanthine oxidase steady state with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehydepHk cat/K mk catK ms−1m−1s−1μm5.53.57 × 1042.64746.07.44 × 1043.57486.59.25 × 1045.18567.01.63 × 1057.00437.61.70 × 10510.4618.01.51 × 10513.1878.51.07 × 10510.3969.06.50 × 10414.32209.41.72 × 10422.41300 Open table in a new tab Studies of the reductive half-reaction of xanthine oxidase with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde were carried out at 10 °C in a stopped-flow apparatus following the loss of absorption at 460 nm due to reduction of the flavin and iron-sulfur centers of the enzyme under anaerobic conditions. It is known that full reduction of xanthine oxidase requires 3 eq of substrate and that this reaction goes essentially to completion in the case of xanthine. On the other hand, xanthine is unable to fully reduce xanthine dehydrogenase, owing to the establishment of unfavorable internal redox equilibria with this enzyme (27Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13528-13538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the reaction of the aldehyde substrate with the oxidase also goes to completion under the present experimental conditions, the total absorbance change elicited by a 3-fold stoichiometric excess of 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde was compared with that induced by a comparable amount of xanthine when the enzyme concentration and other conditions were the same. It was found that on addition of 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde under anaerobic conditions, the level of xanthine oxidase reduction was the same as that by xanthine (data not shown), indicating that xanthine oxidase is indeed completely reduced by 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. The reaction of xanthine oxidase with a pseudo first-order excess of 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde under anaerobic conditions was found to exhibit two well resolved kinetic phases. The rate constant for the faster phase of the reaction exhibits hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration, yielding values for the limiting rate constant (k lim) and substrate dissociation constant (K d) that are pH-dependent.k lim/K d for this faster phase exhibits a bell-shaped pH dependence with a lower pK a of 6.5 ± 0.2 and a higher pK a of 8.3 ± 0.2 (Fig.2), comparable to that seen in the steady-state experiments above and consistent with the reductive half-reaction being principally rate-limiting during turnover, as is the case for turnover with xanthine (25Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4350-4362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results again implicate an active-site residue that must be deprotonated for the reaction to occur. The above results are consistent with a reaction mechanism involving nucleophilic attack on the substrate carbonyl by a Mo–OH group, with base-assisted proton abstraction from the attacking hydroxyl by a residue in the active site of the enzyme (Scheme FS1 B). Recently, the crystal structure of aldehyde oxidase fromDesulfovibrio gigas was solved at 1.8 Å, and on the basis of this structure, a mechanism of aldehyde hydroxylation was proposed that involves similar chemistry (19Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Liu M.-Y. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romãbo M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). 3The coordination geometry inferred from the crystallographic work is that of a distorted square pyramid, with an apical Mo=S group and the two sulfurs of the pterin cofactor, a Mo=O group, and a fifth oxygen ligand defining the basal plane (19Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Liu M.-Y. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romãbo M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1995; 270: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This last ligand has been formulated as a water molecule on the basis of a Mo–O distance of ∼2.2 Å, which is in the range for a metal-bound water (as opposed to hydroxide). As has been pointed out recently, however, this distance must be regarded as an upper limit for the true Mo–O distance, owing to series truncation artifacts around the heavy metal ion that occur in generation of the electron density map for the protein; these artifacts may in some cases lead to an overestimation of the true Mo–O distance by as much as 0.3 Å (28Schindelin H. Kisker C. Rees D.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 2: 773-781Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether this is a concern in the case of the molybdenum center of the aldehyde oxidoreductase. A hydroxide ligand is preferred here on the following additional grounds. 1) In small inorganic complexes of MoVI, oxygen ligands are most frequently found as fully deprotonated Mo=O, occasionally as singly protonated Mo–OH, but only extremely rarely as fully protonated Mo–OH2 (29Stiefel E.I. Prog. Inorg. Chem. 1977; 22: 1-223Google Scholar). 2) Computational studies have shown that Mo–OH is expected to be considerably more stable from a thermodynamic standpoint than Mo–H2O in the specific coordination geometry found in the active site of the aldehyde oxidoreductase (30Voityuk A.A. Albert K. Köstlmeier S. Nasluzov V. Neyman K. Hof P. Huber R. Romãbo M.J. Rösch N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3159-3160Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Specifically, it was proposed that Glu-869 at the active site abstracts a proton from molybdenum-bound water/hydroxide and thereby facilitates nucleophilic attack on the substrate carbonyl to generate, after hydride transfer, a MoIV complex with product coordinated to the metal via the newly formed -OH. Xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase share a highly homologous amino acid sequence in the vicinity of their molybdenum centers that includes this glutamate residue (VGE 869LPL for the D. gigas proteinversus VGE 1261PPL for the bovine enzyme). We thus suggest that Glu-1261 of xanthine oxidase plays a role analogous to that proposed for Glu-869 of aldehyde oxidase, in which case the pK a associated with the enzyme is most likely to be associated with this residue. Although the observed pK a of ∼6.4 is rather high for a glutamate, it is not unreasonable: the pK a for Glu-35 in lysozyme has been reported to be 6.5 in the absence of substrate and to shift to ∼8.2 on binding glycol chitin (31Parsons S.M. Raffery M.A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We note that it is unlikely that the ionization governing the acid limb of thek lim/K d pH profiles is due to the Mo–OH group itself, as x-ray absorption studies of xanthine oxidase have demonstrated quite unambiguously that at pH 8.5 (well above the pK a for the active-site residue), the molybdenum center possesses only a single Mo=O group rather than the two that would be expected were the Mo–OH to deprotonate (32Cramer S.P. Hille R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 8164-8169Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The slower phase of the reaction of xanthine oxidase with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, which accounts for only 10–20% of the total observed spectral change at high substrate concentrations, has observed rate constants between 0.1 and 0.2 s−1 that are not strikingly dependent on substrate concentration. The rate constant associated with the slower phase of the reaction is too large to reflect the slow reduction of nonfunctional enzyme that is known to occur with xanthine oxidase (25Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4350-4362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Massey V. Brumby P.E. Komai H. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1682-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it appears that the slower phase most likely involves processes taking place during the reaction of the enzyme with a second or (more likely) third eq of substrate under the present conditions of pseudo first-order excess of substrate. Such kinetic complexity has also been observed in the reaction of xanthine with xanthine dehydrogenase (34Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18904-18914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this idea, a single-turnover experiment was performed in which the enzyme rather than substrate was present in excess. When excess xanthine oxidase was reacted with 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (5:1 xanthine oxidase/substrate), only a single kinetic phase was observed, corresponding in rate to the fast phase of the rea"

Exposure of animals to TCDD results in many toxic actions (see Ref. 1DeVito M.J. Birnbaum L.S. Schecter A. Dioxins and Health. Plenum Press, New York1994: 139-162Crossref Google Scholar for a review). Dramatic differences in dioxin toxicity have been observed between the sexes of some animal species, suggesting hormonal modulation of dioxin action (2Peterson R.E. Theobold H.M. Kimmel G.L. CRC Crit Rev. Toxicol. 1993; 23: 283-335Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar).Dioxins are lipophilic compounds that readily pass through membranes and bind to an intracellular receptor with no known enzymatic function, called the Ah receptor (for a review, see Ref. 3Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The Ah receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor that stimulates gene expression when coupled with another structurally related protein, Ah receptor nuclear translocator (4Reyes H. Reisz-Porzasz S. Hankinson O. Science. 1992; 256: 1193-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The heterodimer binds specific DNA sequences, AhREs, and initiates transcription of various genes, including those for xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (5Matsushita N. Sogawa K. Ema M. Yoshida A. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21002-21006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Estrogen regulates the proliferative cycle of the endometrium and mammary glands by binding to estrogen receptor and stimulating transcription, in part, by inducing growth factors and growth factor receptors (for a review, see Ref. 6O'Malley B. Tsai M.J. Parker G.M. Steroid Hormone Action. IRL Press, London1993: 44-63Google Scholar). Like the Ah receptor, estrogen receptor is a transactivating enhancer protein. Upon ligand binding, estrogen receptor forms a homodimer that recognizes specific DNA sequences, estrogen response elements, located in target genes. Estrogen-responsive tissues are particularly sensitive to dioxin actions, some of which are not toxic. For example, TCDD exerts protective effects against the appearance of benign mammary and uterine tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats (7Kociba R.J. Keyes D.G. Beyer J.E. Carreon R.M. Wade D.A. Dittenberger D.A. Kalnins R.P. Frauson L.E. Park C.N. Bernard S.D. Hummel R.A. Humiston C.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1978; 46: 279-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An epidemiology study showed that breast and endometrial cancers were slightly reduced in women exposed to dioxin as a result of an industrial accident that occurred in Seveso, Italy (8Bertazzi P.A.

In contrast, rhesus monkeys exposed to TCDD showed a concentration-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of endometriosis (9Rier S.E. Martin D.C. Bowman R.E. Dmowski W.P. Becker J.L. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1993; 21: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), a painful condition correlated with infertility (10Olive D.L. Schwartz L.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1759-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The association of endometriosis with TCDD exposure has resulted in several medical hypotheses linking its incidence in humans with environmental exposure to dioxin (11Bois F.Y. Eskenazi B. Environ. Health. Perspect. 1994; 102: 476-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Koninickx P.R. Braet P. Kennedy S.H. Barlow D.H. Hum. Reprod. 1994; 9: 1001-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).A mechanism explaining the interaction between estrogen and dioxin signaling has yet to be defined. Some investigators have argued that TCDD is anti-estrogenic (13Moore M. Narasimhan T.R. Wang X. Krishnan V. Safe S. Williams H.J. Scott A.I. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) because it antagonizes many estrogen actions, including estrogen-stimulated proliferation of cultured mammary cells and estrogen-stimulated increase in uterine weights (for a review, see Ref. 14Safe S. Astroff B. Harris M. Zacharewski T. Dickerson R. Romkes M. Biegel L. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 69: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). TCDD is not a typical estrogen antagonist, however, because it does not compete with estrogen binding to its receptor (15Poland A. Glover E. Kende A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4936-4946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, TCDD induces three known cytochrome P450 isozymes that hydroxylate 17β-estradiol, the most biologically potent estrogen, to various catechols (16Martucci C.P. Fishman J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 57: 237-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). These isozymes, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1, are under direct transcriptional regulation by Ah receptor interacting at AhREs (17Quattrochi L.C. Pendurthi U.R. Okino S.T. Potenza C. Tukey R.H. Proc.

These cytochromes play important roles in xenobiotic metabolism but also appear to mediate 17β-estradiol hydroxylation in some cells.Conversely, estrogen appears to mitigate Ah receptor-mediated cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity in many different systems. This was first observed by Nebert et al. (20Nebert D.W. Bausserman L.L. Bates R.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1970; 6: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) almost 30 years ago, when reduced cytochrome P450-catalyzed aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in both animals and cultured cells was observed after exposure to 17β-estradiol.

ECC-1 endometrial cells contain functional Ah receptors and respond to TCDD, which induces CYP1A1 activity in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner (27Ricci M.S. Toscano D.G. Toscano Jr., W.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar).Estrogen Reduced CYP1A1 ActivityWe examined whether 17β-estradiol altered TCDD-mediated induction of CYP1A1 activity. ECOD activity was measured in cell extracts from ECC-1 cultures exposed to saturating levels of TCDD (10 nm) and various concentrations of 17β-estradiol. Estrogen reduced CYP1A1 activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). The EC50 for 17β-estradiol modulation of ECOD activity was 0.9 nm, which correlates well with the apparent K D for 17β-estradiol in ECC-1 cells (0.7 nm) (27Ricci M.S. Toscano D.G. Toscano Jr., W.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). CYP1A1 activity in the presence of 17β-estradiol was reduced by 75% compared with that in cells exposed to TCDD alone. The time dependence of 17β-estradiol action was also examined. Exposing ECC-1 cultures to 17β-estradiol resulted in a decrease in ECOD activity from the earliest indication of activity (2 h) that lasted until the experiment was terminated at 65 h (Fig. 1 B). Maximal reduction of CYP1A1 activity after exposing ECC-1 cultures to 17β-estradiol in the presence of TCDD occurred after 8 h of exposure and was maintained throughout the time course analysis.Estrogen Action Was SpecificExposing ECC-1 cultures to other steroid hormones did not mediate a decrease in TCDD-induced ECOD activity (Fig. 2). Cultures exposed to TCDD plus 4-androstene-3,17-dione, an estrogen precursor, had no effect on the level of induced CYP1A1. Cultures exposed to TCDD plus dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid receptor ligand, and cultures exposed to TCDD plus progesterone, a progesterone receptor ligand, showed a 20% increase in induced ECOD activity. Both the glucocorticoid receptor and the progesterone receptor are present in ECC-1 cells (27Ricci M.S. Toscano D.G. Toscano Jr., W.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids tend to enhance Ah receptor induction of CYP1A1, presumably by glucocorticoid receptor binding at glucocorticoid-responsive elements located within the CYP1A1gene (47Prough R.A. Linder M.W. Pinaire J.A. Xiao G.-H. Falkner K.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors bind to the same DNA sequence; therefore, it is possible that the progesterone receptor interacts with the same response elements located within the CYP1A1 gene (48Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 14: 459-479Google Scholar). These data suggest that the steroid hormone-mediated decrease in Ah receptor action was estrogen-specific.Reversibility of 17β-Estradiol ActionTo further establish involvement of the estrogen receptor, we examined whether estrogen receptor antagonists could reverse 17β-estradiol reduction of CYP1A1 induction. Two structurally different “anti-estrogens,” 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 182,780, alter 17β-estradiol binding to estrogen receptor and were used in these experiments (49Pink J.J. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2321-2330PubMed Google Scholar, 50Wakeling A.E. Dukes M. Bowler J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3867-3873PubMed Google Scholar). ECC-1 cultures were exposed to combinations of TCDD, 17β-estradiol, and either 4-hydroxytamoxifen or ICI 182,780, and ECOD activity was measured after 48 h of exposure. Anti-estrogens reversed estrogen attenuation of TCDD-induced ECOD activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3). The EC50 values for 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 182,780 were 750 and 100 nm, respectively. Reversal of estradiol action by estrogen receptor antagonists indicated a role for estrogen receptor in reduction of TCDD induction of CYP1A1 by 17β-estradiol.Figure 3Estrogen receptor antagonists reversed 17β-estradiol action and reinstated TCDD induction of cytochrome P450 activity. Confluent cultures were exposed to a combination of TCDD (10 nm) plus 17β-estradiol (10 nm) in the presence of various concentrations of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (○) or ICI 182,780 (•) for 48 h. Results are expressed as percentage of activity induced by TCDD (10 nm) plus the antagonist (1000 nm). Enzyme activity in cultures exposed to TCDD plus tamoxifen was 49.78 ± 2.95 pmol/mg of protein/min, and TCDD plus ICI 182,780 was 74.9 ± 1.36 pmol/mg of protein/min. CYP1A1 activity was measured as described in Fig. 2.

We selected MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells because they, like ECC-1 cells, are derived from estrogen-sensitive tissue and are regulated by 17β-estradiol (51Brooks S.C. Locke E.R. Soule H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6251-6253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Horwitz K.B. Costlow M.E. McGuire W.L.

As a comparison, we selected Hep-3B human liver cells, and HuE, a primary human keratinocyte cell, neither of which is derived from estrogen-regulated tissues. Similar to ECC-1 cells, 17β-estradiol reduced TCDD-induced CYP1A1 activity in MCF-7 cells, but induction of CYP1A1 in Hep-3B and HuE cells by TCDD was unaffected by the presence of 17β-estradiol (Fig.4). To confirm that estrogen receptor level could be a factor in determining the mitigation response by 17β-estradiol, we examined each cell line for estrogen receptor content by radioreceptor assay (27Ricci M.S. Toscano D.G. Toscano Jr., W.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar), followed by Scatchard analysis (54Limbird L.E. Cell Surface Receptors: A Short Course on Theory and Methods. Martinus Nijhoff, Boston1986Crossref Google Scholar). We were unable to detect estrogen receptors in either HuE or Hep-3B cells by this method, but both ECC-1 and MCF-7 cells contained similar quantities of estrogen receptor with comparable apparentK d values (MCF-7: K d = 0.74 ± 0.08 nm, B max = 418 ± 54 fmol/mg; ECC-1: K d = 0.74 ± 0.07 nm, B max = 282 ± 38.5 fmol/mg). 2M. S. Ricci and W. A. Toscano, unpublished observations. Figure 417β-Estradiol reduced CYP1A1 activity only in estrogen-regulated cells. Confluent cultures of ECC-1 human endometrial cells, MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells, Hep-3B human liver cells, and HuE primary human keratinocyte cells were exposed for 48 h to 10 nm TCDD, with or without 10 nm 17β-estradiol. The solvent control was 0.1% Me2SO (DMSO). CYP1A1 activity was assayed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The data shown are the mean from three separate cultures performed in triplicate ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)17β-Estradiol Treatment Decreased CYP1A1 mRNA LevelsTo determine whether reduced monooxygenase activity reflected altered CYP1A1 mRNA expression, we examined steady-state levels of CYP1A1 mRNA over time in ECC-1 cells exposed to TCDD and 17β-estradiol by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA collected from cells exposed to saturating concentrations of TCDD and 17β-estradiol showed a reduction of TCDD-induced CYP1A1 mRNA when compared with cells exposed to TCDD alone (Fig. 5). Cells that were not exposed to TCDD did not display detectable CYP1A1 mRNA. Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograph showed that estrogen reduced CYP1A1 mRNA to 35% of TCDD-induced levels after 24 h, in close agreement with the observed decrease in enzymatic activity (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether this effect could be reversed, we exposed cultures of ECC-1 cells to combinations of TCDD, 17β-estradiol, and the anti-estrogens used earlier. The estrogen receptor antagonists ICI 182,780 and 4-hydroxytamoxifen each reversed estrogen action at the level of CYP1A1 mRNA and did not affect CYP1A1 induction by TCDD (Fig.6).Estrogen Inhibited Dioxin-mediated Transcription of CYP1A1To investigate whether estrogen exerts control over CYP1A1 mRNA levels by affecting its transcription, we performed transient transfections of ECC-1 with a reporter plasmid containing a portion of the 5′ regulatory sequence for the human CYP1A1 gene (−1612/+292). This segment contains the promoter and at least three functional AhREs (32Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 66-71PubMed Google Scholar,39Hines R.N. Mathis J.M. Jacob C.S.

Exposing transiently transfected cells to TCDD increased luciferase activity 24-fold above that measured in the Me2SO control (2.1 × 103 versus 49.6 × 103 relative light units/mg of protein). Exposing transfected cells to both TCDD and 17β-estradiol resulted in a 74% decrease in TCDD-induced luciferase activity (Fig.7). Addition of estrogen receptor antagonists reversed the estrogen-mediated decrease of TCDD-induced transcriptional activation of the reporter plasmid.Figure 7Transient transfection of ECC-1 cells showed 17β-estradiol-mediated reduction of Ah receptor transcription is reversible by estrogen receptor antagonists.ECC-1 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing a portion of the 5′-regulatory sequence of the CYP1A1 gene (−1612/+292) that drives transcription of firefly luciferase when activated by TCDD. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid overnight and exposed to the chemical(s) indicated in 0.1% Me2SO (DMSO) (10 nm TCDD, 10 nm17β-estradiol (E2), 1 μm ICI 182,780, 1 μm 4-OH-tamoxifen (TAM)) for 48 h. Cells were lysed, and relative luciferase activity was measured and normalized to protein content. Each column represents the mean from three separate cultures performed in triplicate ± S.E. Statistical analysis comparing TCDD alone to TCDD plus the chemicals indicated was performed by ANOVA. Significant difference (*) was observed only between TCDD plus 17β-estradiol and TCDD alone (p < 0.004).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To establish whether the decrease in CYP1A1 mRNA occurred at the transcriptional level and whether transcription varied over time, we performed nuclear run-off experiments using nuclei collected from ECC-1 cultures exposed to TCDD alone, or TCDD plus 17β-estradiol, after 1.5, 4, and 12 h. 17β-Estradiol reduced CYP1A1 transcription at each time point examined (Fig.8 A). Densitometric analysis of autoradiographs from three separate experiments showed that TCDD induced CYP1A1 mRNA maximally by 1.5 h of exposure, which was maintained for at least 12 h (Fig. 8 B). Exposure of ECC-1 cultures to 17β-estradiol reduced transcription by 60%. The data suggest a linear relationship exists between CYP1A1transcription, steady-state message levels, and expression of functional enzyme that was uniformly affected by exposure of ECC-1 cultures to 17β-estradiol.Figure 8Estrogen decreased transcription rate of TCDD-induced CYP1A1. Confluent cultures were exposed to either TCDD (10 nm) or TCDD plus 17β-estradiol (10 nm) for the times indicated. Nuclei were isolated, andin vitro transcription of nascent RNA proceeded in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. Newly transcribed mRNA was isolated and hybridized to CYP1A1 cDNA and human β-actin cDNA.

The data indicate a minimal decrease in AhRE binding by nuclear proteins from ECC-1 cultures exposed to TCDD and 17β-estradiol compared with cultures exposed to TCDD alone. Statistical analysis of areas of shifted bands from densitometry indicated no significant difference in DNA binding from nuclear extracts of ECC-1 cells exposed either to TCDD alone or to TCDD plus 17β-estradiol. This observation suggests that the estrogen receptor does not interfere with the ability of the Ah receptor to interact with AhRE.Figure 917β-Estradiol reduced Ah receptor complex binding to AhRE. ECC-1 cells were exposed to TCDD (T) (10 nm) and 17β-estradiol (E2) (10 nm) alone or in combination, or with solvent alone (0.1% Me2SO (DMSO)), for 1 h, after which nuclear protein extracts were prepared. Sixty micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated with32P-labeled AhRE oligonucleotide probe and subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions. The arrow indicates bound AhRE. Statistical analysis of areas obtained from densitometric scans by one-way ANOVA showed no significant differences between the groups exposed to TCDD alone or in the presence of TCDD and 17β-estradiol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)17β-Estradiol Does Not Affect CYP1B1 mRNA LevelsTo examine whether the observed decrease in CYP1A1 activity, message, and transcription rate was specific to CYP1A1, or a generalized action, we examined whether 17β-estradiol affected the mRNA level of another TCDD-regulated gene, CYP1B1. We used Northern blot analysis to assess steady-state levels of CYP1B1 message in RNA extracted from ECC-1 cultures exposed to TCDD alone, or TCDD plus various concentrations of 17β-estradiol for 24 h (Fig.10). The level of CYP1B1 mRNA was not altered by exposure of the cells to 17β-estradiol, but the CYP1A1 message levels decreased as a function of 17β-estradiol concentration, indicating the effect was specific to theCYP1A1 gene. This experiment was performed twice with similar results.Recovery of TCDD-mediated TranscriptionThe promoter sequences of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 contain several AhRE sites and binding sites for the SP-1 general transcription factor (56Jones K.W.

Transcription of CYP1A1 is regulated, in part, by the NF-1 transcription factor, but CYP1B1 is not (56Jones K.W. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell.

In addition, NF-1 functions synergistically with estrogen receptor to activate transcription driven by that receptor (59Martinez E. Dusserre Y. Wahli W. Mermod N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because the estrogen receptor and NF-1 interact, we hypothesized that activated estrogen receptor may sequester NF-1 thereby reducing ability of the Ah receptor complex to induce CYP1A1. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether overexpression of NF-"

Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of the NR interaction domain (NID) of p160 proteins containing three NR box motifs (LXXLL) for the interaction with the hormone-binding domains of NRs. Here we report that, in addition to NID, another region of coactivator GRIP1 (amino acids 1011–1121), called the auxiliary NID (NIDaux), is requiredin vitro and in vivo for efficient interaction with a subset of NRs, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), androgen receptor, and retinoic acid receptor α. A second group of NRs, which includes the progesterone receptor, retinoid X receptor α, thyroid hormone receptor β1, and vitamin D receptor, required only NID for efficient interaction. For binding to GR, the NID and NIDaux of GRIP1 must act in cis, but deletion of up to 144 amino acids between the two regions did not reduce binding efficiency. Amino acids 1011–1121 of GRIP1 also contain a p300 interaction domain, but mutational analysis indicated that the p300 interaction function within this region is separable from the ability to contribute to GR hormone-binding domain binding.

NRs play critical roles in cellular responsiveness to many types of internal and external signals during development and adult life of all higher eukaryotes. NRs are typically composed of three major functional domains (5Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.-R. Chambon P.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar); many, but not all, NRs have an N-terminal activation domain (AD) called AF-1 that carries no sequence homology between different NRs. A highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) in the central region of the polypeptide chain, composed of two four-cysteine zinc fingers, is the hallmark of the NR family. The C-terminal hormone-binding domain (HBD), which carries a lower degree of sequence homology among diverse NRs, is responsible for hormone binding in Class I and II NRs and also carries a second important transactivation domain called AF-2. Hormone binding controls the biological activity of the Class I and II NRs. NRs regulate the expression of specific genes by interacting directly or indirectly with specific enhancer elements in the promoters of the target genes (2Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev.

Class I NRs bind DNA as homodimers, whereas Class II NRs generally form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (3Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G.

The most well documented mechanism of gene activation by NRs involves direct binding of an NR dimer, through its DBDs, to specific enhancer elements. In addition, many NRs have been shown to modulate the activities of other types of transcription factors (e.g.AP1) indirectly, by binding to the other factors directly, or perhaps through associated coactivator proteins; this modulation can involve DNA binding by the NR (12Diamond M.I.

These two ADs often contribute synergistically to transcriptional activation and probably have different mechanisms of activation. These mechanisms may involve both direct and indirect (through adaptor or coactivator proteins) contacts with components of the basal transcription machinery and chromatin (2Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W.

Members of the p160 family share ∼40% sequence identity with regions of high and low homology interspersed across their 1400-amino acid length. These transcriptional coactivators do not enhance the expression of genes by themselves because they do not bind to DNA and are not components of the basal transcription machinery. Rather, they are recruited to the promoters through their contacts with the NRs. The p160 coactivators can bind, and may exist in a complex with, two other types of coactivators: CBP or its homologue p300 and p/CAF (p300/CBP-associatedfactor) (9Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T.

CBP can also bind to components of the basal transcription machinery (28Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol.

The ability of p160 coactivators to interact with NR HBDs is essential for their coactivator function (29Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is presumably accomplished by serving as adaptors that link AF-2 AD in NR HBD with components of chromatin and the transcription machinery. Mutational analyses of the AF-2 domains of several NRs have provided a strong correlation between loss of transactivation activity and binding to p160 coactivators (16Oñate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J.

Sladek, M. D. Ruse, Jr., L. Nepomuceno, S.-M. Huang, Y. Maeda, and M. R. Stallcup, submitted for publication. To recognize the diverse group of NR HBDs, the p160 coactivators use multiple mechanisms of interaction (31Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Each p160 coactivator molecule contains three leucine-rich motifs (LXXLL, where X is any amino acid), called NR boxes, clustered in the central region of the polypeptide chain (13Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 29Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), called the NR interaction domain (NID). Each NR box motif is capable of binding specifically and in a hormone-dependent manner to a diverse group of NR HBDs, but the NR binding preferences of each NR box are somewhat different (13Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar,29Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Thus, although no single NR box motif has a universal ability to bind all NR HBDs efficiently, the multiple motifs present in the p160 proteins collectively contribute to the broad NR binding specificity. Here we report an additional mechanism that enables the GRIP1 coactivator to interact efficiently with some of the NR HBDs. We found that GRIP1 NID was not sufficient by itself to support an efficient interaction with some NR HBDs. This led to identification of a new region of GRIP1 required for efficient interaction with a subset of NR HBDs. The yeast expression vector pGAD424.GRIP1/fl for the fusion protein of Gal4 AD and full-length GRIP1 was described previously (18Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The yeast expression vectors for the fusion proteins of Gal4 AD and different GRIP1 fragments were made by subcloning PCR-amplified GRIP1 cDNA fragments into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pGAD424 (CLONTECH), which has a leu2 marker gene, or into pHGAD, which was made by inserting a PCR-amplified fragment (containing the adh1 promoter, Gal4 AD, andadh1 transcription termination signal from pGAD424) into theXhoI/SacI sites of pH2, which has a 2μ replication origin and a his3 selection marker and was derived from pRS423 as described (34Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11424-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The yeast expression vectors for fusion proteins of Gal4 DBD and the HBDs of the mouse glucocorticoid receptor (GR), human androgen receptor (AR), human progesterone receptor (PR), human retinoic acid receptor α, human retinoid X receptor α, human thyroid receptor β1 (TRβ1), and human vitamin D receptor were described previously (17Hong H.

Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M.

Internal deletions and point mutations of the GRIP1 sequence were made by four-primer PCR as described previously (36Chen D. Kohli K. Zhang S. Danielsen M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 422-430PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting DNA sequences were subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGAD424. The SRC-1-GRIP1 fusion gene was also constructed by four-primer PCR, and the resulting DNA sequence was subcloned into the SalI/BglII sites of pGAD424. 3SRC-1a sequence is from GenBankTMaccession number U90661. The bacterial expression vectors for the fusion proteins of GST with GRIP1 fragments 563–767 and 563–1121, pGEX-4T1.GRIP1563–767His6 and pGEX-4T1.GRIP1563–1121His6, were made by inserting PCR-amplified GRIP1 cDNA fragments into theBamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX-4T1.His6(31Darimont B.D.

Yeast two-hybrid assays for the interaction between GRIP1 fragments and NR HBDs were performed as described previously (29Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, the following hormone concentrations were added to yeast cultures for 14–16 h before harvest: 10 μm deoxycorticosterone for GR, 100 nm dihydrotestosterone for AR, 500 nmprogesterone for PR, 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid for the retinoic acid receptor, 10 μm9-cis-retinoic acid for the retinoid X receptor, 10 μm 3,5,5′-triiodo-l-thyronine for TR, and 1 μm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for the vitamin D receptor. β-Galactosidase activities are shown as the mean ± S.D. from three independent yeast transformants. Expression of GST-GRIP1-(563–1121)-His6 or GST-GRIP1-(563–767)-His6 in Escherichia coli, purification of fusion proteins, loading of measured amounts of fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose beads, incubation of in vitro synthesized TR and GR with the beads, and analysis of bound TR and GR were performed as described previously (31Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Eluted bead-bound proteins and input labeled proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fraction of input NR that was bound to beads was determined by PhosphorImager analysis of the gel. For peptide competition assays, 35S-labeled in vitro translated GR was incubated with 1.6 μmglutathione-agarose-bound GST-GRIP1-(563–767)-His6 or GST-GRIP1-(563–1121)-His6 in the presence of increasing amounts of peptide KENALLRYLLDKDD (synthesized by the University of California at San Francisco Biomolecular Resource Center). The rest of the procedure was performed as described above. The amount of bound GR was calculated relative to the amount of retained receptor in the absence of peptide. The importance of the three clustered NR box or LXXLL motifs in the NID of the p160 coactivator family for binding to the HBDs of all NRs has been established (13Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 29Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). However, although short polypeptides containing one or more of the NR box motifs are sufficient for binding some NR HBDs (32Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar), our preliminary experiments had indicated that the requirements for GR HBD binding to GRIP1 were more complex. To define the minimum fragment of GRIP1 required for binding GR HBD, we tested the interactions of GR HBD with various GRIP1 fragments in the yeast two-hybrid system (38Fields S. Song O.-k. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar). In these assays, GR HBD was expressed as a fusion protein with Gal4 DBD, and GRIP1 fragments were fused with Gal4 AD. Interactions between the HBD and a GRIP1 fragment result in the activation of a β-galactosidase reporter gene controlled by a Gal4 enhancer. Among the GRIP1 fragments tested, only GRIP1-(730–1121) exhibited the ability to interact with GR HBD in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1,left panel). Note that GRIP1-(730–1121) contains only the third of the three LXXLL motifs (NR box III), but it interacted with GR HBD as strongly as full-length GRIP1 (1462 amino acids). We have previously shown that NR box III is the most important NR box for binding GR HBD (29Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, GRIP1-(5–765), which contains all three LXXLL motifs, and GRIP1-(1121–1462), which has no NR box motifs, did not interact with GR HBD. All the tested GRIP1 fragments were expressed and could interact with control proteins in the yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1, right panel). Since GRIP1-(730–1121) exhibited full activity to interact with GR HBD, this fragment was used as a starting point for a further deletion analysis in the yeast two-hybrid assays. Deletion of 20 N-terminal amino acids, including NR box III, resulted in the complete loss of interaction with GR and PR HBDs (Fig. 2, fragment D); thus, in this context, where NR boxes I and II were missing, NR box III was absolutely required for the interaction of GRIP1-(730–1121) with NR HBDs. Deletion of amino acids 1020–1121 or 934–1121 from GRIP1-(730–1121) (Fig. 2, fragments B and C) also resulted in dramatically reduced interaction with GR HBD, but had only minor effects on binding of PR HBD. Thus, GRIP1-(730–1121) is the minimum single fragment of GRIP1 that maintains the ability to interact with GR HBD, although it extends far downstream from NID. In contrast, efficient binding of PR HBD requires NID, but not the auxiliary downstream sequences. Internal deletions of amino acids 869–938 (which correspond to a natural splicing variant of GRIP1) 4H. Hong and M. R. Stallcup, unpublished results. or amino acids 868–1010 did not affect the interaction between GRIP1 and GR or PR HBD (Fig. 2, fragments H and I). Therefore, GRIP1 amino acids 1011–1121, which we have named the auxiliary NID (NIDaux), constitute a separate region required for efficient binding to GR HBD, but not PR HBD. GRIP1-(883–1121), GRIP1-(939–1121), and GRIP1-(1011–1121) (fragments E–G) alone did not exhibit any ability to bind GR or PR HBD, but they all bound to p300. Thus, NIDaux alone did not bind GR HBD, but functioned in the context of one or more of the upstream NR boxes I–III. GRIP1 amino acids 1011–1121 not only functioned as an auxiliary domain for binding of GR HBD, but also were necessary and sufficient for the interaction with p300 (fragments G and I). p300 was previously shown to bind to this region of GRIP1 and the related p160 coactivators (20Chen H.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27629-27634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism for collaboration between NID and NIDaux in the binding of GR HBD, we tested whether these two regions of GRIP1 must work in cis (present in the same protein fragment) or can work in trans (as separate protein fragments). Efficient binding of GR HBD occurred only when NID and NIDaux were expressed as a fused protein in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig.3). All of the GRIP1 fragments in this experiment were functionally expressed since fragments that included amino acids 939–1121 or 1011–1121 interacted with p300 (Fig. 2), and GRIP1-(730–868) could interact with PR HBD (data not shown) in the yeast two-hybrid system. The different requirements of GR and PR HBDs for binding to GRIP1 suggest that there are two different types of interactions between NR HBDs and GRIP1 (Figs. 1 and 2). We therefore used the yeast two-hybrid system to test several other Class I and II NR HBDs for their dependence on the NIDaux of GRIP1. Since different NR HBDs exhibit different preferences for the three NR boxes (13Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 29Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used GRIP1 fragments that included all three NR box motifs of GRIP1 in these experiments. Inclusion of all three LXXLL motifs also presents a more physiological context for the interactions. One GRIP1 fragment, GRIP1-(563–1121), contained NID and NIDaux; the second fragment, GRIP1-(563–1019), contained only NID. GR, AR, and retinoic acid receptor α belong to a subset of NRs that interacted efficiently with GRIP1 NID only when NIDaux was also present; in contrast, PR, retinoid X receptor α, TRβ1, and vitamin D recept"

The pH optimum of the cellobiose-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity ofP. chrysosporium CDH was acidic, whereas that of H. insolens CDH was neutral. The absorption spectra of the two CDHs showed them to be typical hemoproteins, but there was a small difference in the visible region. Limited proteolysis between the heme and flavin domains was performed to investigate the cofactors. There was no difference in absorption spectrum between the heme domains ofP. chrysosporium and H. insolens CDHs. The midpoint potentials of heme at pH 7.0 were almost identical, and no difference in pH dependence was observed over the range of pH 3–9. The pH dependence of cellobiose oxidation by the flavin domains was similar to that of the native CDHs, indicating that the difference in the pH dependence of the catalytic activity between the two CDHs is because of the flavin domains. The absorption spectrum of the flavin domain fromH. insolens CDH has absorbance maxima at 343 and 426 and a broad absorption peak at 660 nm, whereas that of P. chrysosporium CDH showed a normal flavoprotein spectrum. Flavin cofactors were extracted from the flavin domains and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The flavin cofactor fromH. insolens was found to be a mixture of 60% 6-hydroxy-FAD and 40% FAD, whereas that from P. chrysosporium CDH was normal FAD. After reconstitution of the deflavo-proteins it was found that flavin domains containing 6-hydroxy-FAD were clearly active but their cellobiose oxidation rates were lower than those of flavin domains containing normal FAD. Reconstitution of flavin cofactor had no effect on the optimum pH. From these results, it is concluded that the pH dependence is not because of the flavin cofactor but is because of the protein molecule.

Cellulose, which consists of linear polymers of 1,4-linked β-d-glucose units, is the predominant structural component of plant cell walls and is estimated to account for about half of the organic material in the biosphere. Because of this abundance, cellulose biodegradation has a great impact on the global carbon cycle and recovery of natural resources. Cellulose biodegradation by filamentous fungi has generally been considered to involve only three types of hydrolytic enzymes, i.e.endo-1,4-β-d-glucanases, 1,4-β-d-glucan cellobiohydrolases, and 1,4-β-d-glucosidase (1Wood T.M. McCrae S.I. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Erikssonet al., however, demonstrated that the degradation rate of cellulose by a cell-free culture of the white-rot fungusSporotrichum pulverulentum (Phanerochaete chrysosporium) was higher in the presence of oxygen than in its absence, suggesting the participation of some oxidation-reduction reaction (2Eriksson K.E.

In the course of cellulose degradation, many cellulolytic fungi produce extracellular cellobiose-oxidizing enzymes as well as cellulose-hydrolyzing enzymes such as cellulases (3Ayers A.R. Ayers S.B. Eriksson K.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4Eriksson K.-E.L. Habu N. Samejima M. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1993; 15: 1002-1008Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Ander P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 297-311Google Scholar). Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH, 1The abbreviations used are: CDH, cellobiose dehydrogenase; CBO, cellobiose oxidase; CBQ, cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase; DCPIP, 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; EPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. EC1.1.99.18) is a flavohemoprotein that oxidizes cellobiose using molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor (3Ayers A.R. Ayers S.B. Eriksson K.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It was formerly known as cellobiose oxidase (CBO, EC 1.1.3.25), but Fe(III)-containing compounds and quinones were found to have much higher affinity for this enzyme than does molecular oxygen (6Kremer S.M. Wood P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Samejima M. Eriksson K.-E.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) so CBO was recently renamed CDH (8Bao W. Usha S.N. Renganathan V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have also demonstrated that another cellobiose-oxidizing flavoprotein, cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase (CBQ, EC 1.1.5.1) (9Westermark U. Eriksson K.E. Acta Chem. Scand. Ser. B. 1974; 28: 209-214Crossref Google Scholar, 10Westermark U. Eriksson K.E. Acta Chem. Scand. Ser. B. 1975; 29: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), is the flavin-containing domain of CDH produced by proteolytic activity (11Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Ruiz A. Uzcategui E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 12Wood J.D. Wood P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Habu N. Samejima M. Dean J.F.D. Eriksson K.-E.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to their catalytic function, both CDH and CBQ can bind to cellulose as well as many cellulases (11Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Ruiz A. Uzcategui E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Renganathan V. Usha S.N. Lindenburg F. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 32: 609-613Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was reported that the cellulose-binding site is located on the flavin domain but not in the catalytic site, because the enzyme bound to cellulose can still oxidize cellobiose (14Renganathan V. Usha S.N. Lindenburg F. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 32: 609-613Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, CDH adsorption on cellulose is also observed during cellulose degradation in vivo, especially at cracks on the cellulose surface formed by cellulases (15Igarashi K. Samejima M. Saburi Y. Habu N. Eriksson K.-E.L. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of this enzyme has not yet been clarified, there is no doubt that CDH contributes to cellulose biodegradation. CDH oxidizes the reducing-end groups of cellobiose, higher cellodextrins, and even cellulose to the corresponding δ-lactones in the presence of electron acceptors (3Ayers A.R. Ayers S.B. Eriksson K.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 16Kremer S.M. Wood P.M. FEMS Lett. 1992; 92: 187-192Crossref Google Scholar). Considering the cellobiose-oxidizing ability of both CDH and its flavin domain (CBQ), the flavin cofactor appears to be directly responsible for the oxidation of cellobiose (11Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Ruiz A. Uzcategui E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Concomitantly with cellobiose oxidation, CDH can reduce both Fe(III)-containing compounds and quinones effectively; however, the reduction processes are significantly different. The reduction rate of cytochrome c by CDH was reported to be extremely higher than that by the flavin domain, whereas the rates of DCPIP reduction by CDH and the flavin domain were similar (17Henriksson G. Comprehensive Summaries of Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Science and Technology. 112. Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis, 1995: 35Google Scholar). It has been reported that both cytochrome c and DCPIP were reduced by CDH at pH 4.2, whereas only DCPIP was reduced effectively at pH 5.9. This phenomenon was explained by stopped-flow kinetic study that both flavin and heme were reduced at a high rate at pH 4.2, whereas only flavin reduction proceeded quickly at pH 5.9 (18Samejima M. Philips R.S. Eriksson K.-E.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). From these observations, the reduction of cytochrome c is dependent on heme, and an electron is transferred from cellobiose to this electron acceptor via both FAD and heme, whereas the reduction of DCPIP is catalyzed only by flavin. The thermophilic soft-rot fungus Humicola insolens also produces CDH under cellulolytic conditions, as do other cellulolytic fungi (19Schou C. Christensen M.H. Schülein M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, this fungus produces CDH that has a neutral pH optimum in cytochrome c reduction, whereas CDH produced by other fungi have the optimum at acidic pH and show no activity at around neutral pH. In this study, therefore, CDH was purified fromP. chrysosporium and from H. insolens, and the differences between two enzymes were investigated. P. chrysosporium CDH was purified from the medium of a cellulose-grown culture of P. chrysosporium as described by Samejima et al. (20Samejima M. Ohkubo T. Igarashi K. Isogai A. Kuga S. Sugiyama J. Eriksson K.-E.L. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 25: 135-141Google Scholar). H. insolens CDH was purified from Celluzyme™ CAX63 (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) by using the same procedure. The purity of P. chrysosporiumand H. insolens CDH preparations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, isoelectric focusing, and the Rz value (A 421/A 280). d-Cellobiose was purchased from ICN. 2,3-Dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (ubiquinone) and bovine heart cytochrome c were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Dithiothreitol was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Papain was purchased from Elastin Products Co., Inc. (MO). FAD was purchased from Sigma. 6-Hydroxy-FAD was a generous gift from Dr. Vincent Massey, the University of Michigan. Calcium chloride (suprapure grade) was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Enzyme activities were assayed as described by Samejima and Eriksson (7Samejima M. Eriksson K.-E.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Ubiquinone (500 μm) reduction was monitored photometrically by following the absorbance at 406 nm (ε = 0.745 mm−1 cm−1). Cytochrome c reduction was assayed by monitoring the increase of absorbance at 550 nm (ε = 22.4 mm−1 cm−1). Spectrophotometric experiments were performed with a Shimadzu UV-1600PC spectrophotometer. The following buffers (50 mm solutions) were used for the pH dependence studies of enzyme activity and midpoint potential of the heme domain: sodium citrate (pH 3.0–4.0), sodium acetate (pH 4.0–6.0), MES (pH 6.0, 6.5), HEPES (pH 7.0, 7.5), EPPS (pH 8.0, 8.5), and CHES (pH 9.0). SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 10% polyacrylamide gel and a Mini-PROTEAN® II Cell (Bio-Rad). Ultrathin-layer isoelectric focusing was done essentially as described by Radola (22Radola B.J. Electrophoresis. 1980; 1: 43-56Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar) using 5% polyacrylamide gel with 2% Ampholite and a Model 111 Mini IEF Cell (Bio-Rad). Limited proteolysis of CDH by papain was performed essentially as described by Henriksson et al. (11Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Ruiz A. Uzcategui E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). CDH (20 mg) was incubated in 25 ml of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5 mg of papain for 6 h, and then the solution was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650S (Tosoh Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) column (11 × 120 mm) equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and eluted with a 150-ml linear gradient of KCl (0–250 mm) in the same buffer. The fractions containing the heme domain were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Ultrafree CL, Millipore Co.) and then used for experiments. The fractions containing the flavin domain, which had cellobiose-ubiquinone activity, were pooled and further purified by hydrophobic chromatography. The buffer solution was changed to 20 mm phosphate buffer containing 1 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, and then the flavin domain sample was applied to a column of phenyl-Toyopearl 650M (16 × 120 mm) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a 500-ml reverse gradient to 20 mm phosphate buffer. The ubiquinone-active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration as described above. A direct electrochemical technique was used to measure the pH dependence of the oxidation reduction potential of the heme domain as described by Hagen (23Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Glassy carbon, platinum, and Ag/AgCl were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry was performed in the presence of 50 mmMgCl2. The midpoint potential was determined by averaging the anodic and cathodic peak potentials. Flavin extraction from the flavin domain was based on the cold trichloroacetic acid method. That is, 100 μl of 50 μm flavin domain, cooled on ice, was mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid aqueous solution. The mixture was kept on ice for 10 min and centrifuged to remove the precipitate. The supernatant was neutralized by the addition of 1300 μl of 1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The samples were applied to a Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge (Millipore Co.), eluted with 50% methanol, 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and concentrated by evaporation using a nitrogen gas stream. Flavin was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with a JASCO-HPLC system (Jasco Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Supelcosil LC-18-T column (4.6 × 250 mm; Supelco, Inc., PA) with a linear gradient of 20–30% methanol, 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and flavin was detected by measuring the absorption at 440 nm, which is the isosbestic point of the anionic and protonated forms of 6-hydroxy-FAD. Authentic FAD and 6-hydroxy-FAD were used as standards for identification and quantitation of flavin under the same conditions. Preparation of deflavo-CDH was based on the method of Komai et al. (24Komai H. Massey V. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1692-1700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That is, 500 μl of 10 μmCDH, containing 5 mm cellobiose, 5 mmdithiothreitol and 3.0 m (P. chrysosporium) or 2.5 m (H. insolens) CaCl2 in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0 (P. chrysosporium), or HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 (H. insolens), was kept on ice for 60 min, and then the solution was passed through a desalting column (Ampure SA; Tosoh Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, to stop the reaction and to remove low molecular weight materials. The obtained deflavo-CDH (1 μm) was kept on ice. For reconstitution, deflavo-CDH was incubated with 2 μm flavin, FAD, or 6-hydroxy-FAD, and 5 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0 (P. chrysosporium) or HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 (H. insolens) on ice for 60 min. The reconstituted preparations were concentrated by ultrafiltration as described above to remove excess free flavin and dissolved in the same buffers. The flavin domain was prepared by limited proteolysis as described in a previous section. For spectrophotometric determination, the deflavo-flavin domain was prepared by the same procedure but without flavin reconstitution. Native, deflavo-, and reconstituted flavin domains showed the same molecular weight on SDS-PAGE, indicating that the treatments had no effect on the proteolytic site. CDH purified from culture solution of P. chrysosporium gave a single band at 90 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig.1, lane 1), the isoelectric point was 4.2, and the Rz value (A 421/A 280) was 0.62. During purification, it was found that crude cellulase powder fromH. insolens contained three CDH fractions: one major fraction (94 kDa, pI 4.4, and Rz 0.63) and two minor fractions (both 92 kDa, pI 4.0, and Rz0.63). Although all CDH was eluted in the same fraction in the first strong anion-exchanging chromatography (QAE-Toyopearl 550C), it was separated into two fractions, 94- and 92-kDa fractions by weak anion-exchanging chromatography (DEAE-Toyopearl 650S) as reported by Schou et al. (19Schou C. Christensen M.H. Schülein M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the 92-kDa fraction was further separated into two minor CDHs by hydrophobic chromatography (phenyl-Toyopearl 650M). In this study, the major fraction of CDH (94 kDa) was used for further investigation as CDH from H. insolens. The CDHs from P. chrysosporium and H. insolenshad different values of pH optimum when the pH dependence of cytochromec reducing activity was monitored using cellobiose as a substrate (Fig. 2); CDH from H. insolens had the pH optimum around pH 7.5–8.0, whereas CDH fromP. chrysosporium had the optimum at pH 3.5–4.0. The specific activity of H. insolens CDH at pH 7.5 was 3.3 s−1 and was 10-fold lower than that of P. chrysosporium CDH at pH 4.0 (37 s−1). Absorption spectra of the oxidized CDHs are shown in Fig.3. Both enzymes showed typical hemoprotein spectra having an absorption maximum at 421 nm (γ band). It should be noted, however, that minor differences in the region of 450–500 and 300–400 nm were found between the two CDHs because of the difference in the flavin chromophore, as described below. The spectral patterns of the two minor fractions of CDH from H. insolensdescribed above were similar to that of the major fraction (data not shown), suggesting that all CDHs from H. insolens have the same flavin chromophore.Figure 3Absorption spectra of P. chrysosporiumand H. insolensCDH. Dotted line, P. chrysosporium; solid line, H. insolens. Spectra of the purified enzymes were obtained in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To clarify the reason for the spectral difference, limited proteolysis of the two CDHs with papain was carried out to isolate the heme and flavin domains for further investigation. As shown in Fig. 1, two bands were isolated and purified from each of the CDHs. From the absorption spectra of each band, as described in the following sections, it was concluded that the bands corresponding to molecular masses 35 and 55 kDa were the heme and flavin domains of P. chrysosporiumCDH, respectively, in accordance with the results reported by Henriksson (17Henriksson G. Comprehensive Summaries of Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Science and Technology. 112. Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis, 1995: 35Google Scholar). On the other hand, the bands corresponding to molecular masses 25 and 70 kDa were the heme- and flavin-containing domains from H. insolens CDH, respectively, indicating that proteolysis occurred similarly between the heme and flavin domains but the cleavage site was somewhat different from that of P. chrysosporium CDH. The absorption spectra of the oxidized heme domains separated from P. chrysosporium and H. insolensCDH are shown in Fig. 4. No particular difference was observed in the oxidized heme spectra of the two CDHs. Moreover, no difference in the reduced spectra obtained by addition of sodium dithionite was observed either (data not shown). No significant difference in the redox properties of the heme domains was revealed by determination of the pH dependence of the midpoint potential of each heme domain using a direct electrochemical technique, as shown in Fig.5. The potentials of the P. chrysosporium and H. insolens heme domains were 190 and 185 mV at pH 3.0, respectively, then declined until around pH 4.0–5.0, and became pH-independent over pH 6.0. The potentials of the P. chrysosporium and H. insolens heme domains at pH 7.0 were 130 and 126 mV, respectively. The value for the P. chrysosporium enzyme at pH 4.0 is 180 mV, which is in good agreement with the previously published value of 164 mV obtained by a dye-mediated optical redox titration (6Kremer S.M. Wood P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Figure 5pH dependence of midpoint potential of the heme domains measured by a direct electrochemical technique. ○,P. chrysosporium; •, H. insolens. Cyclic voltammograms of 1.0 mg/ml heme domains were taken from +300 to −300 mV versus Ag/AgCl at various pH values in the buffer systems described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pH dependence of the cellobiose-oxidizing activity of CDH and the flavin domain was monitored in terms of the reduction rate of ubiquinone (Fig.6). As in the case of P. chrysosporium, the flavin domain of H. insolens CDH had cellobiose-oxidizing activity at almost the same level as that of intact CDH, whereas the heme domains of P. chrysosporium andH. insolens CDH had no activity. Thus, it is concluded that the catalytic site of cellobiose oxidation is in the flavin domain of each CDH, and the difference in pH dependence of CDH activity is solely because of the flavin domains. In contrast to the heme domains, the absorption spectra of the flavin domains were considerably different between the two CDHs (Fig.7). The flavin domain from P. chrysosporium showed yellow coloration and had absorption maxima at 387 and 457 nm, typical of flavin (Fig. 7, inset). On the other hand, the flavin domain from H. insolens, showed a green coloration with absorption maxima at 343 and 426, resembling the spectrum of 6-hydroxyflavin, but a broad peak was observed at around 660 nm at pH 7.5. The long-wavelength absorption peak disappeared at pH 5.0, and the color changed to yellow, consisting with 6-hydroxyflavin derivatives. The long-wavelength absorption was shifted to 660 nm in the flavin domain of H. insolens CDH (Fig. 7), as compared with the broad peak at 600 nm of free 6-hydroxy-FAD (Fig. 7,inset). The prosthetic group of the flavin domain, extracted by treatment with trichloroacetic acid, was analyzed by HPLC (Fig.8). The isolated flavin was non-fluorescent even after phosphodiesterase treatment. A comparison of the retention time with those of authentic FAD (7.5 min) and 6-hydroxy-FAD (14.0 min), indicated that the flavin domain fromP. chrysosporium contained at least 95% FAD, whereas theH. insolens flavin domain contained a mixture of 60% 6-hydroxy-FAD and 40% FAD. After treatment of authentic FAD and 6-hydroxy-FAD with phosphodiesterase, the samples were subjected to HPLC. The retention times of the phosphodiesterase-treated authentic FAD and 6-hydroxy-FAD were shifted from and to 8.5 and 15.5 min, respectively, because of the conversion from FAD- to FMN-type compounds. When the flavin cofactors from CDHs were also treated with phosphodiesterase, their retention times were identical with those of the authentic FMNs. Thus, it was concluded that the flavin cofactors from CDHs were FAD forms and that 6-hydroxy-FAD was the dominant cofactor of H. insolens CDH. To examine the effect of 6-hydroxy-FAD on the activity of the flavin domain, the deflavo-domains from the two CDHs were prepared, and their cellobiose-oxidizing activity was determined after reconstitution with FAD or 6-hydroxy-FAD. The use of the flavin domains prepared after limited proteolysis was unsuccessful. However, active flavin domains were successfully obtained by reconstitution of whole deflavo-CDHs with flavin followed by limited proteolysis of the reconstituted CDHs. The deflavo-CDHs from P. chrysosporiumand H. insolens were prepared by incubation of the enzyme with a high concentration of CaCl2 in the presence of cellobiose under the different conditions, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The absorption spectra of the deflavo and reconstituted flavin domains are shown in Fig. 9. The absorption spectrum of the domain from P. chrysosporium CDH reconstituted with FAD (Fig. 9 A) was almost identical with that of the native domain, whereas that of the domain from H. insolens CDH reconstituted with 6-hydroxy-FAD CDH (Fig.9 B) was similar to but not identical with that of native domain, which contains a mixture of FAD and 6-hydroxy-FAD, as shown in the previous section. Compared with the spectrum of the native flavin domain (Fig. 7 A), reconstitution with 6-hydroxy-FAD caused loss of the shoulder peak around 470 nm, but the long-wavelength absorbance peak of 6-hydroxy-FAD shifted to 660 nm after binding to the protein, as in the native sample. Cellobiose-oxidizing activity of the enzymes with reconstituted FAD or 6-hydroxy-FAD is shown in Table I. The activity of the P. chrysosporium domain reconstituted with FAD was comparable with that of the native sample, indicating that the reconstitution procedure had been successful. The activity of the flavin domains reconstituted with 6-hydroxy-FAD from P. chrysosporium and H. insolens amounted to about one-third at pH 4.0 and less than one-sixth at pH 7.5 as compared with that of the domains reconstituted with FAD. The activity of theH. insolens enzyme reconstituted with FAD was 1.8-fold higher than that of the native enzyme at pH 7.5, whereas that of the enzyme reconstituted with 6-hydroxy-FAD was about 60% of the native one, a finding which can be well explained by the fact that the native enzyme contains a mixture of 60% 6-hydroxy-FAD and 40% FAD.Table IEffect of reconstitution for specific activity (s−1) of cellobiose oxidizing activityP. chrysosporiumH. insolenspH 4.0Native16 ± 0.471.2 ± 0.04FAD14 ± 0.411.8 ± 0.056-OH-FAD5.5 ± 0.170.68 ± 0.02pH 7.5Native4.2 ± 0.133.3 ± 0.10FAD4.1 ± 0.126.0 ± 0.196-OH-FADND0.96 ± 0.03Cellobiose oxidation was monitored by reduction of ubiquinone as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ND, not detected.

Thus, these spectrophotometric and activity measurements of the reconstituted enzyme confirmed that CDH from H. insolenscontains 6-hydroxy-FAD as the dominant cofactor that is catalytically active, though less than FAD. It is also clear that the pH dependence of the activity was not because of the flavin cofactor but, rather, was because of the protein molecule because the pH dependence of the two CDHs was little affected by flavin replacement, as judged from the activities at pH 4.0 and pH 7.5. Three CDH fractions were isolated from H. insolenscrude cellulase, whereas only one CDH was contained in culture solution of P. chrysosporium. Two fractions containing 92 and 94 kDa species were separated from H. insolens by anion exchange chromatography, as reported by Schou et al. (19Schou C. Christensen M.H. Schülein M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but one of them (92 kDa) was further separated into two fractions by hydrophobic chromatography using phenyl-Toyopearl 650M in this experiment although these two minor CDH species had the same molecular mass (92 kDa), the same isoelectric point (4.0), and similar absorption spectra. It is not clear at the moment whether these fractions are the different gene products or products of post-translational modification. In this study, the major fraction of CDH (94 kDa, pI 4.4) was used for experiments as CDH from H. insolens. The optimum pH of the cellobiose-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity of CDH from P. chrysosporium was in the acidic pH range, whereas that of CDH from H. insolens was at neutral pH. This is consistent with the pH optima for cellulase activity and fungal growth on cellulose, which are pH 3–5 and 7–8 for P. chrysosporium and H. insolens, respectively (25Eriksson K.E. Pettersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Schülein M. Tikhomirov D.F. Schou C. Found. Biotech. Ind. Ferment. Res. Publ. 1993; 8: 109-116Google Scholar). In this way CDH can cooperate effectively with cellulase in the cellulose biodegradation process in both fungi. The absorption spectrum of the oxidized forms of two CDHs were typical of hemoproteins though there were small differences between two spectra. To clarify these phenomena, limited proteolysis with papain was performed to prepare heme- and flavin-containing domains. Like P. chrysosporiumCDH (11Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Ruiz A. Uzcategui E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), H. insolens CDH was cleaved into two domains by papain. In both CDHs, the sum of the molecular weights of the two domains was almost identical to the molecular weight of the native CDH, suggesting that papain cleaved a single site between the two domains, although the cleavage site in H. insolens CDH was different from that in P. chrysosporium CDH, resulting in a smaller molecular weight of the heme domain and a larger molecular weight of the flavin domain. The absorption spectrum and midpoint potential were measured to characterize the heme domain. Both heme domains showed typical b-type heme spectra, and no difference was found in either the oxidized or the reduced spectra. Moreover, they showed almost the same pH dependence of midpoint potential. Although Schou et al. suggested that a difference in the environment of heme causes the difference of optimum pH between P. chrysosporium and H. insolens CDH (19Schou C. Christensen M.H. Schülein M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the present experiments clearly demonstrate that the difference in pH dependence is not because of heme as a prosthetic group but rather is because of the flavin domain. The profile of pH dependence of cellobiose-oxidizing activity was very similar for the flavin domain and intact CDH in both cases, indicating that the optimum pH of CDH mostly depends on the activity of the flavin domain. The prepared flavin domain of H. insolens CDH showed a green color with a broad peak at long wavelength, whereas that of P. chrysosporium CDH was yellow, showing a typical riboflavin-type spectrum. A similar spectrum to that of the flavin domain of H. insolens CDH has been reported by Mayhew et al. for the green chromophore, 6-hydroxy-FAD, in electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii (27Mayhew S.G. Whitfield C.D. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the CDH flavin domain, free 6-hydroxy-FAD showed a shift of the long-wavelength absorption from 600 to 660 nm, as in the case of ETF. HPLC analysis of extracted flavin was carried out to identify and quantify the prosthetic group of the flavin domain. Comparison with authentic samples indicated that the flavin cofactor of H. insolens CDH is a mixture of 60% 6-hydroxy-FAD and 40% FAD, whereas that of P. chrysosporium CDH consisted only of FAD. This finding accounts well for the existence of shoulders at 380 and 475 nm in the absorption spectrum of H. insolens flavin domain (Fig. 7 A). Morpeth and Jones isolated cellobiose quinone dehydrogenase (CBQ) as a simple flavoprotein from P. chrysosporium and showed that it has a nonfluorescent green chromophore as the active cofactor (28Morpeth F.F. Jones G.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 236: 221-226Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The spectrum of their native enzyme suggested that 6-hydroxy-FAD was present as a minor component of the prosthetic group. However, in the case of H. insolensCDH, 6-hydroxy-FAD was contained as the dominant cofactor. The spectral patterns of the other minor fractions of CDH from H. insolens were similar to that of the major fraction, suggesting that all CDHs from H. insolens have the 6-hydroxy flavin chromophore. Thus, H. insolens CDH is unique in containing 6-hydroxy-FAD as the dominant cofactor. As the activity of CDH containing 6-hydroxy-FAD was lower than that of the enzyme reconstituted with normal FAD, the physiological significance of the presence of 6-hydroxy-FAD is not clear but may reflect biosynthetic factors. From the reconstitution experiments with 6-hydroxy-FAD or FAD, it is clear that the pH dependence was not because of the flavin cofactor but was intrinsic to the protein molecule. Reconstitution with FAD enhanced the cellobiose-oxidizing activity of H. insolens flavin domain, indicating that CDH containing 6-hydroxy-FAD is active but has a lower cellobiose-oxidizing activity than the enzyme containing normal flavin. Systematic studies using various modified flavins with different redox potentials will be needed to see whether potential change of the prosthetic group affects the activity because the midpoint potential of FAD (−219 mV; Ref. 29Lowe H.J. Clark W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 221: 983-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is more positive than that of 6-hydroxy-FAD (−255 mV; Ref. 30Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1990. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1991: 59-66Crossref Google Scholar), and such a study is in progress. We thank Dr. Jean LeGall for valuable discussions and suggestions in this investigation."

We report here the isolation from mouse brain of a cDNA encoding G-substrate. This cDNA was used to localize G-substrate mRNA expression, as well as to produce recombinant protein for the characterization of G-substrate phosphatase inhibitory activity. Brain and eye were the only tissues in which a G-substrate transcript was detected. Within the brain, G-substrate transcripts were restricted almost entirely to the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, although transcripts were also detected at low levels in the paraventricular region of the hypothalamus and the pons/medulla. Like the native protein, the recombinant protein was preferentially phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (K m = 0.2 μm) over cAMP-dependent protein kinase (K m = 2.0 μm). Phospho-G-substrate inhibited the catalytic subunit of native protein phosphatase-1 with an IC50 of 131 ± 27 nm. Dephospho-G-substrate was not found to be inhibitory. Both dephospho- and phospho-G-substrate were weak inhibitors of native protein phosphatase-2A1, which dephosphorylated G-substrate 20 times faster than the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1. G-substrate potentiated the action of cAMP-dependent protein kinase on a cAMP-regulated luciferase reporter construct, consistent with an inhibition of cellular phosphatases in vivo. These results provide the first demonstration that G-substrate inhibits protein phosphatase-1 and suggest a novel mechanism by which cGMP-dependent protein kinase I can regulate the activity of the type 1 protein phosphatases.

Cyclic GMP acts as a second messenger in numerous physiological processes including smooth muscle relaxation, visual transduction, olfaction, neurotransmitter release, and long term depression of cerebellar Purkinje cells (1Lev-Ram V.

Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). G-substrate was identified in the cytosol of rabbit cerebellum as the first soluble protein whose phosphorylation was stimulated specifically by cGMP and not cAMP (4Schlichter D.J. Casnellie J.E. Greengard P. Nature. 1978; 273: 61-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The subsequent purification and characterization of G-substrate confirmed its specificity as a substrate for cGK and found it to be a heat-stable, acid-soluble protein of low molecular weight (5Aswad D.W. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3494-3500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-substrate is phosphorylated at two threonine residues located in nearly identical sites, as determined by sequencing of tryptic peptides (6Aitken A. Bilham T. Cohen P. Aswad D.W. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3501-3506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against G-substrate localized G-substrate within the brain to the cerebellum by radioimmunoassay (7Nairn A.C. Detre J.A. Casnellie J.E. Greengard P. Nature. 1982; 299: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Examination of mutant mice lacking certain neurons revealed the enrichment of G-substrate in cerebellar Purkinje cells, a cell type where cGK I is also found in great abundance (8Detre J.A. Nairn A.C. Aswad D.W. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first suggestion as to the function of G-substrate arose from its similarity to the protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (9Aswad D.W. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3487-3493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-substrate shares a number of characteristics in common with inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 (dopamine- and adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein-32,000), two specific inhibitors of the catalytic subunit of the type I protein phosphatases (PP1c) (10Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Tung H.Y. Cohen P. Nature. 1984; 310: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 11Nimmo G.A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These common characteristics include low molecular weight, heat stability, acid solubility, a low content of hydrophobic residues, and a predicted elongated tertiary structure. In addition, inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32, both of which require phosphorylation by cAK to exhibit inhibitory activity, have phosphorylation sites with sequence homology to the phosphorylation sites of G-substrate (12Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cohen P. Rylatt D.B. Nimmo G.A. FEBS Lett. 1977; 76: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Given these similarities, it has been suggested that G-substrate functions as an inhibitor of PP1c following its phosphorylation by cGK (6Aitken A. Bilham T. Cohen P. Aswad D.W. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3501-3506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Detre J.A. Nairn A.C. Aswad D.W. Greengard P. J.

More detailed studies of G-substrate phosphorylation and expression have been limited by the lack of complete amino acid sequence information. In this study, we report the isolation from mouse brain of a cDNA encoding murine G-substrate. Using this cDNA, we have examined G-substrate mRNA expression, as well as the interaction of recombinant G-substrate with several protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Total RNA was isolated from mouse brain as described (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63082) Google Scholar), and poly(A) RNA was purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose (16Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5179) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized from poly(A) RNA by reverse transcription in a mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 50 μg/ml random hexamer primers, 40 μg/ml poly(A) RNA, and 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then diluted to 1 ml. RNase A was added to 20 μg/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, after which phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation were performed. The first strand cDNA was then diluted to 100 ng/μl and used for amplification. The following oligonucleotide primers were synthesized at the University of Michigan Biomedical Research Core Facilities: GGAGATCT AAT GTG GAG TC(A/C/T) GA(C/T) CA(A/G) AA(A/G) AA(A/G) CC and CT(C/T) GT(C/T) TT(C/T) TT(C/T) GG(A/C) (G/T)C(A/C) GCC TTC CTCTTAAGGG. Amplification reactions (100 μl) contained 100 ng of first strand cDNA, 20 μm each oligonucleotide, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.4), bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml), 200 μm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amplification reactions were denatured for 30 s at 95 °C, annealed for 1 min at 45 °C, and extended for 3 min at 72 °C with 40 rounds of amplification in a model PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ Research, Inc.). Products of amplification were analyzed on a 3% NuSieve, 1% agarose gel and then isolated using phenol extraction as described (17Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated fragment was digested with BglII and EcoRI and ligated intoBamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEM-3Zf(+). The resulting plasmid (pGSUBPCR) was denatured and sequenced with SP6 and T7 promoter primers using Sequenase DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 1.2 × 106 recombinant λZapII phage containing mouse brain cDNA fragments were screened by hybridization essentially as described (18Olsen S.R. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11158-11162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheHindIII/EcoRI fragment from pGSUBPCR was isolated and labeled by random primer extension with [α-32P]dATP (ICN Biomedicals). The resulting radiolabeled DNA fragment was hybridized to phage DNA immobilized on Hybond N at 37 °C in 50% formamide, 0.75 m NaCl, 20 mmNaPO4, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 5 mmEDTA, 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, and 0.1% each of bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and Ficoll. Filters were washed at 60 °C in 0.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA (0.1× SET; where SET is SET, 5% SDS, 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA). The first screening of the library resulted in the isolation of a single clone (Fig. 1 A, Clone 1), which was fully sequenced on both strands. The presence of a sequence of C-T repeats upstream of the open reading frame prompted a second library screening, which led to the isolation of three additional independent clones (Fig. 1 A). Clones 2–4 were restriction mapped to confirm the identity of the open reading frame and sequenced at their 5′ and 3′ ends. The nucleotide and the predicted amino acid sequences from G-substrate clone 1 were used to search the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base for homologous sequences using the basic local alignment search tool algorithm (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69631) Google Scholar). An homologous sequence from human infant brain was identified. This integrated molecular analysis of genomes and their expression consortium (LLNL) cDNA clone (integrated molecular analysis of genomes and their expression consortium clone 46041/GenBankTM accession H09006) was obtained from Research Genetics, Inc., and sequenced in both directions. Alignment of predicted amino acid sequences was performed with DNASTAR software. Total RNA was isolated from mouse brain and dissected mouse brain regions as described (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63082) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with oligonucleotides 5′ AGA TCT ACC CAG GAG GAA AGA CAC 3′ and 5′ AAG CTT GCA ACA AAG GGA GGC ATG 3′ with G-substrate clone 1 (pGSUB-1) as a template, resulting in the amplification of a 201-bp fragment from the open reading frame of G-substrate flanked by a BglII site and a HindIII site. This amplified fragment was digested with BglII andHindIII, isolated, and ligated into theBglII/HindIII site of pSP73 to create pSP73.GRP, which was sequenced to confirm the coding region sequence and linearized with BglII. Linearized pSP73.GRP was used as a template to synthesize a 235-bp [α-32P]UTP-radiolabeled riboprobe using T7 RNA polymerase. Sense RNA was generated by SP6 polymerase using HindIII-digested pSP73.GRP as a template. RNase protection analysis was then performed as described (20Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18169-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing the coding region of pGSUB-1 was generated by PCR (see below) and linearized withSacI. The linearized template was used with T7 RNA polymerase to generate a radiolabeled antisense probe as described (21Seasholtz A.F. Gamm D.M. Ballestero R.P. Scarpetta M.A. Uhler M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1734-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The resulting cRNA probe was hybridized with a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) at 60 °C for 16 h. Following hybridization, the blot was washed for 2 h at 70 °C in 0.5× SET containing 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, dried, and autoradiographed. Mouse brains were removed, frozen, cut into 15-μm sections, and processed for in situ hybridization histochemistry as described (21Seasholtz A.F. Gamm D.M. Ballestero R.P. Scarpetta M.A. Uhler M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1734-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Antisense and sense cRNA probes to G-substrate were synthesized in the presence of [35S]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase, using linearized pGSUB-1 as a template, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cRNA probe was diluted to 2 × 106 dpm per 30 μl of hybridization buffer, and sections were hybridized at 54 °C for 16–20 h. Following hybridization, sections were treated with RNase A, washed in 75 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0 (0.5× SSC; where 1× SSC is 150 mm sodium chloride, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), at 58 °C for 60 min, and dipped in Kodak NTB-2 nuclear emulsion (3-week exposure). To simplify purification, an extension of six histidine residues was added to the amino terminus of G-substrate. pGSUB-1 plasmid DNA was used as a template, and the primers GGGAGATCTCCACC ATG CAC CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC ATG GCC ACT GAG ATG ATG AC and CTA CTA AAC CAG GTG GAA AG were used to amplify the coding region of the cDNA. The resulting PCR product was subcloned in pGEMT, and the plasmid pGEMT-GSUB was used for generation of radiolabeled RNA for Northern blotting, as well as construction of a CMV-driven expression vector. The addition of the hexahistidine sequence resulted in the creation of an NcoI site that could be used to distinguish the His6 G-substrate expression vector from the wild type G-substrate expression vector and that altered the Ser-2 codon to an alanine codon. The serine to alanine change and the addition of the hexahistidine tag changed the predicted molecular mass of the recombinant protein to 18,753 Da. For mammalian expression, the plasmid pGEMT-GSUB was digested withBglII, and the fragment encoding histidine-tagged G-substrate was ligated into BglII-digested pCMV.neo (22Huggenvik J.I. Collard M.W. Stofko R.E. Seasholtz A.F. Uhler M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), forming the vector pCMV.His6Gsub. For a typical G-substrate preparation, 20 15-cm plates of COS-1 cells at 30% confluency were transfected with 75 μg/plate of pCMV.His6Gsub DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4815) Google Scholar). Plates were incubated with DNA precipitate for 36 h and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmNaPO4 (pH 7.4)) before being scraped into 20 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. The resulting suspension was sonicated for 5 s and centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a concentration of 10 mm, and the mixture was subjected to a second centrifugation, after which it was applied to a 1-ml column of nickel-affinity resin (Qiagen). The column was washed with 10 ml of Buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted over a continuous gradient of 10–250 mm imidazole in Buffer A. Peak fractions were pooled analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus). Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Micro BCA). G-substrate so purified was typically 85% pure, as determined by densitometry, and was mainly used in kinetic analyses of phosphorylation. The peptide Gln-Lys-Arg-Pro-Arg-Arg-Lys-Asp-Thr-Pro was synthesized at the University of Michigan Biomedical Core Facilities. The peptide, termed G-subtide, was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and its purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The peptide Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg-Ala-Glu (Glasstide) was purchased from Bachem. Phosphotransferase activities were assayed in 50-μl reactions of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgAc, 200 μm ATP, 11 nm [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) (specific activity, 200–300 cpm/pmol), 10 mm NaF, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Increasing concentrations of G-substrate, G-subtide, or Glasstide were assayed as indicated in Fig. 6. cGK Iα (24Francis S.H. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), cGK II (25Gamm D.M. Francis S.H. Angelotti T.P. Corbin J.D. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27380-27388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), or Cα (26Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Olsen S.R. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2316-2323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to a final concentration of 1.3, 5.8, or 5 nm, respectively, to start the reaction. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min, after which they were terminated by spotting onto P81 phosphocellulose papers (Whatman), washed in 10 mm phosphoric acid, and counted.K m and V max values were calculated by Eadie-Hofstee analysis of three experiments (27Eadie G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1942; 146: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 28Hofstee B.H.J. Nature. 1942; 184: 1296-1298Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). All assays were linear with respect to enzyme concentration and time. An insert containing the histidine-tagged G-substrate cDNA was excised from pCMV.His6Gsub by BglII digestion and subcloned into the BglII site of the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac III (Invitrogen), creating the baculovirus transfer vector pBB.His6Gsub. Prior to protein production, recombinant baculovirus plaques were isolated and propagated as described (25Gamm D.M. Francis S.H. Angelotti T.P. Corbin J.D. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27380-27388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To initiate protein expression, 500 ml of Sf9 culture was infected at a density of 6 × 106 cells/ml and a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 72 h, cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C. For a typical G-substrate purification, pellets from three 500-ml cultures were thawed, combined, and resuspended in 120 ml of Buffer A, containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 mm benzamidine. Resuspended cells were sonicated for 15 s, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was brought to 10 mm imidazole and kept on ice for 15 min, after which it was centrifuged as before. The secondary supernatant was loaded onto two 1-ml columns, connected in series, and packed with nickel-affinity resin (Qiagen). The columns were washed in series with 20 ml of Buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted from each column separately with a linear gradient of 10–250 mm imidazole in Buffer A. DEAE chromatography was performed essentially as described (9Aswad D.W. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3487-3493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peak fractions from the nickel affinity columns were pooled and dialyzed for 18 h against two changes of 10 mm KPO4 (pH 8), 0.2 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 25 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EGTA (Buffer B). After dialysis, the nickel affinity peaks were loaded onto a 1-ml column of Macro-Prep DEAE resin (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 10 ml of Buffer B, and the protein was eluted in a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in Buffer B. Peak fractions were combined, concentrated by centrifugation (Amicon Centricon-3), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Because the DEAE buffer interfered with the bicinchoninic acid assay, protein was determined with a modified Lowry assay (Pierce). G-substrate purified in this manner was judged to be greater than 95% pure by densitometry (Kodak Digital Science) and was used for phosphatase inhibition assays. Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry was performed at the University of Michigan Biomedical Core Facilities on a VESTEC-2000 instrument. G-substrate purified from Sf9 cells was phosphorylated at a concentration of 15 μm in a reaction of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgAc, 100 μmEGTA, 20 μm cGMP, and 50 nm cGK Iα (Promega). Phosphorylation proceeded at 30 °C for 2.5 h, after which the kinase was denatured by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. To serve as a non-phosphorylated control in the phosphatase inhibition reactions, a second aliquot of purified G-substrate was subjected to a mock reaction excluding cGK Iα. After heating, both the phosphorylation and control reactions were diluted 10-fold with distilled water and concentrated back to their original volumes in centrifugal concentrators (Amicon Centricon-3) to dilute reaction components such at ATP which might themselves inhibit PP1. A second mock reaction excluding both cGK Iα and G-substrate was prepared, diluted, and concentrated for use as a buffer blank in the phosphatase reactions to control for any inhibitory activity the phosphorylation mix might retain. Following concentration, protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Incorporation of phosphate into G-substrate was quantified essentially as described (5Aswad D.W. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3494-3500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A small aliquot of G-substrate was phosphorylated as described above, except that [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to a specific activity of 500 cpm/pmol. Phosphorylation was terminated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and following centrifugation, protein pellets were washed and counted by Cerenkov counting. Some aliquots of G-substrate were treated prior to phosphorylation with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C for 1 h, after which they were heated at 100 °C for 10 min to denature the phosphatase. Recombinant human DARPP-32 (Chemicon) was phosphorylated at a final concentration of 3.8 μm in a reaction of 20 mm Tris, 10 mm MgAc, 100 μm ATP and 42 nm Cα (Promega) at 37 °C for 3 h, after which the reaction was heated, diluted, and concentrated as described for G-substrate. A control of non-phosphorylated DARPP-32 and a buffer blank were prepared as described for G-substrate. Phosphatase activities were measured using a serine/threonine protein phosphatase assay kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Radiolabeled phosphorylase a was prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer and added as substrate to each phosphatase assay to a final concentration of 10 μm. Reactions of 30 μl were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and terminated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Free phosphate in the reaction supernatants was measured by Cerenkov counting. Data were corrected using blanks in which phosphatase was excluded. The catalytic subunit of native rabbit skeletal muscle PP1 was purified as described (29Wang Q.M. Guan K.L. Roach P.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18352-18358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and was assayed at a final concentration of 0.7 nm in the presence of 8 mm caffeine. Uninhibited PP1c had a specific activity of 7.8 μmol/min·mg in the presence of 10 μmphosphorylase a. Native rabbit skeletal muscle PP2A1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies and assayed at a final concentration of 15 nm in the presence of 10 mm MgAc and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Uninhibited PP2A1 had a specific activity of 0.24 μmol/min·mg in the presence of 10 μm phosphorylasea. PP1 and PP2A1 activities were assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of phospho-G-substrate, dephospho-G-substrate, phospho-DARPP-32, dephospho-DARPP-32, and okadaic acid (Upstate Biotechnologies), as indicated. In PP1c assays, the G-substrate buffer alone was found to be inhibitory at only the two highest concentrations, and the data were corrected accordingly. In the PP2A1 assays, the G-substrate buffer alone was not inhibitory, even at the highest concentrations. All inhibition assays were performed in triplicate, and inhibition constants were calculated from curves fit to the data using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific), except for the IC50 of DARPP-32, which was extrapolated graphically. All phosphatase assays were linear with respect to enzyme concentration and time. G-substrate purified from Sf9 cells was phosphorylated as before, except that [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was increased to a specific activity of 20,000 cpm/pmol. Phosphorylation was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then repeatedly diluted with distilled water and concentrated (Amicon Centricon-3) until contaminating free phosphate comprised less than 10% of the radioactivity counted in the pellet after a small aliquot was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Native rabbit skeletal muscle PP1c was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies and had a specific activity of 10 μmol/min·mg in the presence of 10 μm phosphorylasea. The ability of PP2A1 or PP1c to dephosphorylate phospho-G-substrate was measured as for phosphorylasea except that each phosphatase was assayed at a final concentration of 2 nm and phospho-G-substrate, at a final concentration of 190 nm, replaced phosphorylasea in the assay. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for increasing periods, as indicated. Assays were performed in triplicate and curves fitted to the data using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). Ten-cm plates of HEK-293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)-luciferase, 2 μg of SV2-β-gal plasmid, and 20 μg of CMV-His6Gsub expression vector essentially as described previously (30Gamm D.M. Baude E.J. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15736-15742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and the cells incubated for 8 h. The media were then changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 300 μm chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and extracts assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (30Gamm D.M. Baude E.J. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15736-15742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2138293795,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a relatively small, 12.5-kDa protein that is structurally related to some isomerases and for which multiple immune and catalytic roles have been proposed. MIF is widely expressed in tissues with particularly high levels in neural tissues. Here we show that MIF is able to catalyze the conversion of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylaminechrome and norepinephrinechrome, toxic quinone products of the neurotransmitter catecholamines 3,4-dihydroxyphenylamine and norepinephrine, to indoledihydroxy derivatives that may serve as precursors to neuromelanin. This raises the possibility that MIF participates in a detoxification pathway for catecholamine products and could therefore have a protective role in neural tissues, which as in Parkinson's disease, may be subject to catecholamine-related cell death.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MIF is about 30% identical in sequence to a protein namedd-DOPAchrome tautomerase (d-Dct), which specifically catalyzes the isomerization of the d-isomer of DOPAchrome (DC) (16Zhang M. Aman P. Grubb A. Panagopoulos I. Hindermith A. Rosengren E. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a nonphysiological stereoisomer ofl-DC, a precursor of melanin, as indicated in Fig. 1. Despite its fairly low sequence identity with d-Dct, MIF itself has been shown to have a nondecarboxylative activity for the same substrate leading to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) (17Rosengren E. Bucala R. Aman P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MIF has also recently been shown to have phenylpyruvate tautomerase (18Rosengren E. Aman P. Thelin S. Hansson C. Ahlfors S. Bjork P. Jacobsson L. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and thiol protein oxidoreductase (19Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) activities. DC is chemically related to DOPamine (DN), a sterically inactive intermediate (due to the lack of the carboxyl group at position 2), as well as to norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EP), all of which are neurotransmitters synthesized in catecholaminergic neurons in various parts of the brain. Loss of dopaminergic neurons, particularly in the substantia nigra, is associated with Parkinson's disease (20Temlett J.A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Hastings T.G. Zigmond M.J. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 1997; 49: 103-110PubMed Google Scholar). DN itself has been shown to induce apoptosis in neurons, thymocytes, and other types of cells (22Offen D. Ziv I. Barzilai A. Gorodin S. Glater E. Hochman A. Melamed E. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Shinkai T. Zhang L. Mathias S.A. Roth G.S. J. Neurosci.

Lett. 1994; 170: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). DN, NE, and EP can be oxidized to toxic quinones, such as DOPaminechrome (DNc), norepinephrinechrome (NEc), and epinephrinechrome (EPc), which are precursors of neuromelanin (26Smythies J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 263: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,27d'Ischia M. Prota G. Pigment Cell Res. 1997; 10: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Neuromelanin is a pigment that accumulates in neurons and glial cells, particularly in the human substantia nigra (28Zecca L. Mecacci C. Seraglia R. Parati E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1138: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Enochs W.S. Nilges M.J. Swartz H.M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Prota G. d'Ischia M. Pigment Cell Res. 1993; 6: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Regulation of neuromelanin biosynthesis at the molecular or biochemical level is poorly understood at this time. Its function in the brain is also unknown, but among other possibilities it may act as a sink for toxic by-products of catecholamine synthesis (26Smythies J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 263: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Lindquist N.G. Larsson B.S. Lyden-Sokolowski A. Pigment Cell Res. 1987; 1: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Whatever its role, neuromelanin content in the substantia nigra is inversely correlated with neurological degeneration in Parkinson's disease. Although MIF carries a name associated with the immune system, it is widely expressed and is a prominent component of the immunologically privileged ocular lens and brain (4Wistow G.J. Shaughnessy M.P. Lee D.C. Hodin J. Zelenka P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1272-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 32Galat A. Riviere S. Bouet F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is also a delayed early response gene in fibroblasts induced during the proliferative response to growth factors (5Lanahan A. Williams J.B. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to any effects MIF has in the immune system, it seems likely that it has important roles elsewhere. Because MIF is highly expressed in the brain and because several catecholamines have structural similarity to DC (Fig.1), especially DN, which is sterically inactive, the possibility that one or more of these catecholamines is a physiological substrate for MIF is a tantalizing possibility. Here we characterize the catalytic activity of purified recombinant MIF toward catecholamines and their derivatives. The results demonstrate that MIF has the potential to metabolize several catecholamines and thus may play an important protective role in neural tissues. As such, decline in the level of MIF might contribute to aging and to degenerative processes in the brain and the central nervous system. Two human brain multiple tissue Northern (MTN II and III) blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were probed with human MIF cDNA. A 382-base pair human MIF cDNA fragment derived by RT-PCR was labeled with32P by random priming (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for use as a probe. Hybridization in Expresshyb (CLONTECH) was carried out at 68 °C for 1 h, washed in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and autoradiographed for 1–3 days at −70 °C. For normalization, the blot was stripped and reprobed with a β-actin probe (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant mouse MIF was produced as follows: RT-PCR of mouse lens RNA was used to amplify the coding sequence of mouse MIF using the primers TCCGCCCATATGCCTATGTTCATCGTGAACACC (5′ primer) and AGCGGTGGATCCAAGTGGGGCCAGGACTCAAGC (3′ primer), which incorporatedNdeI (5′) and BamHI (3′) restriction sites. The cDNA was first cloned into the pCRII vector (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced and then subcloned into NdeI andBamHI sites of PET 17b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Following the manufacturer's protocol, protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells and induced with 0.4 mm IPTG for 3 h at 25 °C. The induced cells were washed, and the cells were stored as frozen pellets at −70 °C. The cells were lysed by thawing and sonication with a microtip at a high output setting for two 10-s pulses and centrifuged, and the supernatant (soluble fraction) was dialyzed overnight. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged and concentrated. From the concentrated sample, MIF was purified in the AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by ion exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose high performance column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 pg column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Electrospray spectra were run on a Hewlett Packard 1100 MSD fitted with an electrospray source. Samples were applied to a Zorbax 300SB C8-column (2.1 × 150 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 90% acetonitrile in 5% acetic acid. The mass spectrometer was scanned from 600–1600m/z with a spectrum recorded every 3 s. Use of various substrates and identification of products was performed using HPLC under standard conditions (33Palumbo A. d'Ischia M. Misuraca G. Prota G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, isocratic elution with 0.15 msodium borate buffer (pH 2.5), 25% methanol was used with a C18 column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Peaks were detected using UV absorbance (280 nm), and pmol were calculated based on the absorption of known standards. l-DOPA, d-DOPA, DN, NE, and EP were purchased from Sigma; the “chrome” derivatives of those substrates were generated as described previously (34Pawelek J.M. Körner A.M. Bergstrom A. Bolognia J. Nature. 1980; 286: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, substrates were dissolved in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and cooled to 4 °C; they were mixed continuously for 3 min on ice with 1 mg/ml silver oxide, then filtered through a 0.22 μm filter, and kept on ice until use. Enzymatic assays were performed with various substrates and purified MIF at 37 °C for 1 h; reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of the acidic HPLC buffer, and 20 μl was injected on the column. DHI and DHICA used as standards were generous gifts of Prof. Shosuke Ito (Fujita Health Sciences University, Nagoya, Japan). Spontaneous oxidation of all substrates was determined in the presence of buffer without MIF and has been subtracted from the results. MIF is widely expressed in newborn mouse and fetal human tissues without regard to their immune status (4Wistow G.J. Shaughnessy M.P. Lee D.C. Hodin J. Zelenka P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1272-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar,35Paralkar V. Wistow G.J. Genomics. 1994; 19: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To examine expression of MIF mRNA in the adult human brain, Northern blots for different regions of the brain were probed with human MIF cDNA (Fig. 2). High levels of MIF expression were noted in all regions of the adult human brain, including the substantia nigra. Recombinant MIF was prepared to examine catalytic activity(s) toward possible physiologically relevant substrates. Mouse MIF cDNA (4Wistow G.J. Shaughnessy M.P. Lee D.C. Hodin J. Zelenka P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1272-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 5Lanahan A. Williams J.B. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) was amplified by RT-PCR of mouse lens total RNA and was cloned into the pET17b expression vector. Because of the high conservation of residues at the N and C termini of MIF, which may be involved in enzyme activity (12Suzuki M. Sugimoto H. Nakagawa A. Tenaka I. Nishihira J. Sakai M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Sugimoto H. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nishihira J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), no fusion peptides were included. High yields of MIF protein were obtained after induction by IPTG (Fig.3 A, inset). Recombinant MIF was then isolated from these extracts by fast protein liquid chromatography. Four fractions containing MIF were obtained by gel filtration (Fig. 3 A) and were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 A,inset), by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and by Western immunoblotting (data not shown). Fraction D contained a relatively low level of MIF (apparently in association with some nonprotein absorbance), whereas Fractions A–C contained comparable amounts of MIF. Multiple forms of MIF have been previously reported (36Galat A. Riviere S. Bouet F. Menez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 37Mischke R. Kleemann R.

Pallini V. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 2010-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fractions A–C were subjected to mass spectroscopy (Fraction B is shown in Fig. 3 B) and showed identity with the size expected for native mouse MIF (12,372 Da), with an additional minor component 131 Da greater in size, presumably due to failure to remove the N-terminal initiator methionine. All fractions thus contain chemically similar MIF, and our preliminary results show that these fractions are in dynamic equilibrium involving at least monomer and trimer forms. Other studies have implicated trimeric MIF as the principal native form (12Suzuki M. Sugimoto H. Nakagawa A. Tenaka I. Nishihira J. Sakai M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Sugimoto H. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nishihira J.

Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) although other native forms of MIF may exist (32Galat A. Riviere S. Bouet F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Mozetic-Francky B. Cotic V. Ritonja A. Zerovnik E. Francky A.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fractions A, B, and C were determined to be enzymatically active in preliminary experiments. In this study, we concentrated on the substrate specificity of Fraction B because ultracentrifugation confirmed that 95% of MIF in that fraction was present as a trimer, the rest being in monomeric form. Fraction B has also been tested for biological activity, including the macrophage migration inhibition capillary assay, and was found to be active (11Apte R.S. Sinha D. Mayhew E. Wistow G.J. Niederkorn J.Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5693-5696PubMed Google Scholar). As expected (16Zhang M. Aman P. Grubb A. Panagopoulos I. Hindermith A. Rosengren E. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), recombinant MIF was positive for d-Dct activity (TableI), converting d-DC to DHICA (17Rosengren E. Bucala R. Aman P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of MIF was highly stereospecific, as previously reported; MIF was not active toward the l-isomer of DC, nor was it active toward the l- ord-forms of DOPA, the precursors of DC (Table I). Because the d-isomer of DC is not likely to be the physiological substrate of MIF (because the occurrence of d-DOPA or a DOPA racemase has never been reported), we next examined the potential catalytic function of MIF toward structurally related catecholamines, including DN, NE, and EP and their dihydroxyindole derivatives, DNc, NEc, and EPc (Table I). Although there was no activity of MIF toward DN, NE, or EP, it was quite active toward DNc and NEc and to a lesser extent EPc, converting them to their natural dihydroxyindole derivatives, DHI, 3,5,6-trihydroxyindole (THI), and 3,5,6-trihydroxyindole-1-methylindole (THMI), respectively.Table IEnzyme activity of MIF fraction towards catecholamine-related substratesSubstrate → productActivitynpmol/μg/hd-DC → DHICA123.0 ± 19.512l-DC → DHICAbackground3d-DOPA → DHI or DHICAbackground3l-DOPA → DHI or DHICAbackground3DN → DHIbackground3NE → DHIbackground3EP → DHIbackground3DNc → DHI83.6 ± 4.74NEc → THI26.9 ± 7.711EPc → THMI8.0 ± 3.25Purified recombinant MIF was incubated with substrates as noted for 60 min at 37 °C, then acidified, and separated on HPLC as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these HPLC conditions, typical elution times are as follows: DOPA, 4.6 min; DHI, 7.8 min; DHICA 9.1 min; DN, 4.6 min; DNc, 5.0 min; NE, 4.3 min; NEc, 4.5 min; EP, 4.4 min; EPc, 4.7 min; THI, 6.3 min; and THMI, 6.5 min.

Because MIF seems to be a multifunctional protein, it could have more than one role there. As evidence accumulates that MIF belongs to an enzyme superfamily (12Suzuki M. Sugimoto H. Nakagawa A.

Genome. 1998; 9: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a catalytic role seems likely. Previously it was found that MIF and the related d-Dct are capable of catalyzing the conversion of d-DC to the indole-quinones DHI or DHICA (16Zhang M. Aman P. Grubb A. Panagopoulos I. Hindermith A. Rosengren E. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Rosengren E. Bucala R. Aman P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although thed-stereoisomer of DC is not known to occur naturally, it is chemically related to other physiologically relevant compounds, such as DN, NE, and EP and their chrome derivatives, which are also derived from tyrosine during catecholamine biosynthesis (Fig. 1). Several of these compounds have great significance for brain function. Most notably, DN and NE are neurotransmitters, and the loss of dopaminergic neurons is associated with Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological degeneration (20Temlett J.A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Hastings T.G. Zigmond M.J. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 1997; 49: 103-110PubMed Google Scholar). DN itself has been shown to induce apoptosis in neural cells and thymocytes (22Offen D. Ziv I. Barzilai A. Gorodin S. Glater E. Hochman A. Melamed E. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Shinkai T. Zhang L. Mathias S.A. Roth G.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Offen D. Ziv I. Gorodin S. Barzilai A. Malik Z. Melamed E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1268: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Ziv I. Melamed E. Nardi N. Luria D. Achiron A. Offen D. Barzilai A. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 170: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oxidation of DN, NE, or EP leads to the formation of highly toxic quinones, including DNc, NEc, and EPc. These quinones are known to be precursors of neuromelanin, a pigment that accumulates in neurons and astrocytes, particularly in the substantia nigra (26Smythies J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 263: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27d'Ischia M. Prota G. Pigment Cell Res. 1997; 10: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown here, MIF can readily metabolize DNc to DHI, NEc to THI, a DHI-like indole-quinone, and, to a lesser extent, EPc to THMI. All these DHI-like indole-quinones can undergo spontaneous oxidation and polymerization into melanins, although DNc seems to be the most relevant precursor of neuromelanin formation (26Smythies J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 263: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Enochs W.S. Nilges M.J. Swartz H.M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus MIF has the potential to contribute to the biosynthesis of neuromelanin. Various roles have been suggested for neuromelanin; however, it seems likely that it acts as a sink for toxic products of catecholamine synthesis, including DNc and NEc (26Smythies J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 263: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27d'Ischia M. Prota G. Pigment Cell Res. 1997; 10: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Lindquist N.G. Larsson B.S. Lyden-Sokolowski A. Pigment Cell Res. 1987; 1: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Melanin biosynthesis occurs within melanocytes in skin, hair, and eye and requires the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase and several tyrosinase-related proteins, known as Tyrp1 and Dct (Fig. 1). Interestingly, Dct is a melanocyte-specific enzyme considered to be a ”rescue“ enzyme essential for melanocyte survival (46Urabe K. Aroca P. Tsukamoto K. Mascagna D. Palumbo A. Prota G. Hearing V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 47Tsukamoto K. Jackson I.J. Urabe K. Montague P.M. Hearing V.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Mutations in Dct that decrease catalytic function affect DHICA production and are generally quite toxic to melanocytes. Melanocytes typically express Dct before any of the other melanogenic enzymes, presumably to minimize such toxicity (48Steel K.P. Davidson D.R. Jackson I.J. Development. 1992; 115: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Catecholamine biosynthesis occurs within neural cells and requires a set of distinct enzymes, including tyrosine hydroxylase, DOPA decarboxylase, DOPamine β-hydroxylase, and phenylethanol amine-N-methyl transferase, for the production of DN, NE, and EP. Several mechanisms, enzymatic and nonenzymatic, have been proposed to result in the oxidation of these precursors to their cyclized chrome derivatives (27d'Ischia M. Prota G. Pigment Cell Res. 1997; 10: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and MIF should now be included in the neuromelanin biosynthetic pathway, as noted in Fig. 1. It may also have a similar protective function in catecholaminergic neurons in minimizing intracellular cytotoxicity, comparable with Dct function in melanocytes. To emphasize the importance of neuronal protective mechanisms against catecholamines, it is worth noting that other antioxidant activities contributing to prevent the formation of o-quinones derived from catecholamines have been reported that are based on the conjugation of these compounds to GSH catalyzed by class Mu glutathione transferase M2–2 (49Segura-Aguilar J. Baez S. Widersten M. Welch C.J. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5727-5731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this GST isoenzyme and MIF share a proline residue surrounded by a number of aromatic residues in the N-terminal region, which forms a large hydrophobic pocket that has been proposed to be the active site interacting with the catecholamine substrate (50Suzuki M. Sugimoto H. Tanaka I. Nishihara J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MIF is expressed throughout the adult brain and is therefore widely available to participate in the metabolism of oxidized catecholamines and related compounds. To what extent MIF participates directly in neuromelanin synthesis remains to be seen. However, MIF may have a direct role in helping to detoxify catecholamine-derived quinones, thereby contributing to protection of catecholaminergic neurons and surrounding cells. Indeed, it has been shown that mesencephalic glial cells produce soluble factors that protect dopaminergic neurons from the toxic effects of quinones (51Mena M.A. Casarejos M.J. Carazo A. Paino C.L. de Yebenes G. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Conceivably MIF may participate in this detoxification process; for although DHI, the immediate product of the reaction with DNc, is itself cytotoxic (46Urabe K. Aroca P. Tsukamoto K. Mascagna D. Palumbo A. Prota G. Hearing V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 52Pawelek J.M. Lerner A.B. Nature. 1978; 276: 627-628Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it is less soluble than DNc, and its spontaneous polymerization into melanin-like compounds would further reduce its half-life and consequently, its toxicity. In this context, it is of interest to note that one form of Parkinson's disease has recently been mapped to chromosome 22q13 (53Wilhelmsen K. Mirel D. Marder K. Berstein M. Naini A. Leal S.M. Cote L.J. Tang M.X. Freyer G. Graziano J. Mayeux R. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which is close to or at the human MIF locus on human chromosome 22q11.2 (45Esumi N. Budarf M. Ciccarelli L. Sellinger B. Kozak C.A. Wistow G.J. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Preliminary results suggest that exogenous MIF can protect cultured cells from the toxic effects of catecholamine exposure. 3D. Sinha, J. Matsunaga, V. J. Hearing, and G. J. Wistow, unpublished observations. MIF is expressed in many tissues with no clear connection to catecholamine or to melanin biosynthesis. It also has been identified with a wide range of biological activities, and perhaps these apparently disparate roles are connected. MIF may exert its effects through catalytic activities toward a family of compounds, including the amino acid-derived catecholamines, which, like DN itself, act as important signaling molecules."

The coenzyme is modified through irreversible cleavage of its cobalt-carbon bond, resulting in inactivation of the enzyme by tight binding of the modified coenzyme to the active site. Recombinant DdrA and DdrB proteins of K. oxytoca were co-purified to homogeneity from cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli overexpressing theddrAB genes. They existed as a tight complex,i.e. a putative reactivating factor, with an apparent molecular weight of 150,000. The factor consists of equimolar amounts of the two subunits with M r of 64,000 (A) and 14,000 (B), encoded by the ddrA and ddrB genes, respectively. Therefore, its subunit structure is most likely A2B2. The factor not only reactivated glycerol-inactivated and O2-inactivated holoenzymes but also activated enzyme-cyanocobalamin complex in the presence of free adenosylcobalamin, ATP, and Mg2+. The reactivating factor mediated ATP-dependent exchange of the enzyme-bound cyanocobalamin for free 5-adeninylpentylcobalamin in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, but the reverse was not the case. Thus, it can be concluded that the inactivated holoenzyme becomes reactivated by exchange of the enzyme-bound, adenine-lacking cobalamins for free adenosylcobalamin, an adenine-containing cobalamin.

Diol and glycerol dehydratases are important for producing essential electron acceptors in the fermentation of 1,2-propanediol and glycerol, respectively (5Toraya T. Honda S. Fukui S. J.

This is because a low level of diol dehydratase induced by glycerol substitutes for isofunctional glycerol dehydratase (2Toraya T. Shirakashi T. Kosuga T. Fukui S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Irreversible inactivation of the enzyme results from the tight binding of the modified, inactive cobalamin (4Toraya T. Fukui S. Dolphin D. B12. 2.

Such suicide inactivation seemed enigmatic because glycerol is a growth substrate for K. oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This apparent inconsistency was solved by our finding that the glycerol-inactivated enzymes in permeabilized cells (in situ) of K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniaeundergo rapid reactivation in the presence of free AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+ (or Mn2+) (13Honda S.

Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because the reactivation was detectable only in situ but not in vitro, it remained unclear whether the reactivation is caused by a specific proteinous factor. Recently, we have identified the two open reading frames located in the 3′-flanking of the K. oxytocadiol dehydratase genes as the genes encoding a reactivating factor for glycerol-inactivated diol dehydratase and designated them asddrA and ddrB genes (19Mori K.

This article reports biochemical demonstration that purified DdrA and DdrB proteins form a tight complex that serves as a reactivating factor for glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme as well as O2-inactivated holoenzyme in vitro in the presence of free AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+. Evidence for the reactivating factor-mediated exchange of an enzyme-bound, adenine-lacking cobalamins for a free, adenine-containing cobalamin is also described here.

Because copy numbers of plasmids containing replication origin of p15A, like pCXV are less than those of plasmids containing replication origin of pBR322, like pUSI2E (23Tobimatsu T. Hara T.

Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard. The concentration of purified diol dehydratase was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm (εM, 280) calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar) for diol dehydratase from its deduced amino acid compositions (23Tobimatsu T. Hara T. Sakaguchi M. Kishimoto Y. Wada Y. Isoda M. Sakai T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7142-7148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and subunit structure (22Tobimatsu T. Sakai T. Hashida Y. Mizoguchi N. Miyoshi S. Toraya T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was 120,500m−1 cm−1. Based on the molecular weight predicted, ε1%, 280 was calculated to be 5.81 for diol dehydratase. PAGE was performed under non-denaturing conditions essentially as described by Davis (27Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15961) Google Scholar), except that 5 mm dithiothreitol was added in the gel, or under denaturing conditions as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Protein was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Densitometric analysis of gels was performed with a Printgraph AE-6911CX system (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and the NIH-Image program, Version 1.61 (National Institutes of Health). A purified preparation of the complex of the DdrA and DdrB proteins was separated into the subunits (A and B polypeptides, respectively) by SDS-PAGE (15.0%) and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems). Protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, excised, and analyzed for NH2-terminal amino acid sequences on an Applied Biosystems 491 protein sequencer. The molecular weight of the complex (putative reactivating factor) was determined by gel filtration on Superose 6 column (HR10/30) using a FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified factor and molecular weight marker proteins were applied to the column, which was equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m KCl and developed with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The elution of proteins was monitored byA 280. The amount of aldehydic products formed by diol dehydratase reaction was determined by the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone method (29Toraya T. Ushio K. Fukui S. Hogenkamp H.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of diol dehydratase is defined as the amount of enzyme activity that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of propionaldehyde/min at 37 °C. Reactivation of the inactivated holoenzymes and activation of the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex by the reactivating factor was determined using 1,2-propanediol or glycerol as a substrate in the presence of 21 μm AdoCbl, 24 mm ATP, and 24 mmMgCl2. The capability of reactivating factor to reactivate glycerol-inactivated or O2-inactivated holodiol dehydratase was assayed in vitro using 1,2-propanediol as substrate. The capability of it to activate the inactive enzyme·CN-Cbl complex was also assayed in vitro because these two capabilitiesin situ were shown to be well correlated (18Ushio K. Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). TheddrA and ddrB gene products were co-purified from extracts of overexpressing E. coli. All operations were performed at 0–4 °C. Throughout the purification steps, purity of the proteins in each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. About 10 g of wet cells grown at 30 °C were suspended in 50 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm PMSF and disrupted by sonication for 10 min at 240 W with a Kaijo Corp. TA-5287 ultrasonic destruction system (Japan). After centrifugation at 27,200 ×g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected. The precipitate was washed with 60 ml of the same buffer, and the washing was combined with the supernatant (cell-free extract). Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the cell-free extract to 15% saturation. After centrifugation, solid ammonium sulfate was added again to the supernatant to 35% saturation. The precipitate was dissolved in 20 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm PMSF and dialyzed for 1 day against 2 liters of 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 mm EDTA with one buffer change. The dialysate was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (bed volume, 100 ml) that was equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The column was washed successively with 500 ml of the same buffer and with 600 ml of 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 130 mm KCl and then developed with 800 ml of 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm KCl and 200 ml of the same buffer containing 250 mm KCl. The DdrA and DdrB proteins-containing fractions were pooled. The buffer concentration was lowered by repeating concentration by ultrafiltration through a Diaflo PM-10 membrane (Amicon) and dilution in 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The resulting solution was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (bed volume, 70 ml) which was equilibrated with 2 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The column was washed successively with 280 ml of the same buffer and with 200 ml of 6 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and then developed with 350 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The DdrA and DdrB proteins-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to about 1.7 ml by ultrafiltration through a Diaflo PM-10 membrane and Centriplus (Amicon). The concentrated solution was loaded onto a Sephadex G-200 column (bed volume, 150 ml) which was equilibrated with the 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The column was developed with the same buffer, and the fractions containing the DdrA and DdrB proteins were pooled, concentrated to about 5 ml by ultrafiltration through a Centriplus, and stored at −80 °C. It is evident that the two bands withM r of 64,000 and 14,000 (designated A and B polypeptides, respectively) were overexpressed in E. coliJM109 carrying pUSI2ENd(6/5b) (Fig.1 A). Both of these bands were progressively enriched upon purification. When the purified preparation was electrophoresed under non-denaturing conditions in the presence of dithiothreitol, it migrated as a single band (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, it was clear that the two polypeptides were co-purified as a tight complex. Because the predicted molecular weights of the DdrA and DdrB proteins are 64,266 and 13,620, respectively (20Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Hara T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32034-32041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it was highly suggested that the A and B polypeptides are the products of these genes. The NH2-terminal 10-amino acid sequences of the A and B polypeptides determined by Edman sequencing were MRYIAGIDIG and MNGNHSAPAI, respectively. These sequences agreed completely with those deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the ddrA andddrB genes (20Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Hara T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32034-32041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the A and B polypeptides were undoubtedly identified as the ddrA and ddrB gene products, respectively. These results indicate that the DdrA and DdrB proteins are co-purified and exist as a tight complex under non-denaturing conditions. This complex was considered as a putative reactivating factor. To determine the subunit composition of the factor, the complex purified to homogeneity was separated into subunits by SDS-PAGE in a 15% gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Densitometric analysis of the bands, together with molecular weights of the subunits predicted from the amino acid composition, indicated that the molar ratio of the A and B polypeptides in the complex was approximately 1:1.1. The apparent molecular weight of the complex determined by FPLC with a calibrated Superose 6 column (HR 10/30) was approximately 150,000 (data not shown). By taking the predicted molecular weights of the subunits into consideration, it can be concluded that the subunit structure of the putative reactivating factor is most likely A2B2. The molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm (εM, 280) for the complex (reactivating factor), calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar) from its amino acid compositions and subunit structure, was 58,140 m−1 cm−1. ε1%, 280 for the reactivating factor was calculated to be 3.73 on the basis of the predicted molecular weight. The capability of the putative reactivating factor to reactivate the glycerol-inactivated holodiol dehydratase was examined in vitro using 1,2-propanediol as substrate. As illustrated in Fig. 2 A,in vitro reactivation of the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme by the purified factor in the presence of AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+ was observed for the first time. The reactivation did not take place at all without the factor or with the factor but in the absence of ATP/Mg2+. Free AdoCbl was also absolutely required for the reactivation (data not shown). Thus, it is evident that the factor actually functions as a reactivating factor for glycerol-inactivated diol dehydratase. The product formed increased exponentially at the initial stage of reaction and then almost linearly with time of incubation. By comparison of the maximum slope with the control, the extent of reactivation under the conditions employed was estimated to be approximately 64%. Diol dehydratase holoenzyme is known to undergo inactivation by O2 in the absence of substrate (30Wagner O.W. Lee Jr., H.A. Frey P.A. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1751-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inactivation is considered because of reaction of the activated Co—C bond of the enzyme-bound coenzyme with O2. Fig. 2B shows that the O2-inactivated holoenzyme also undergoes reactivation by the factor in the presence of AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+. The extent of reactivation increased with time of incubation and reached at least 71% at 20 min. Again, the reactivation was strictly dependent on the factor and on ATP/Mg2+ and free AdoCbl. The capability of the reactivating factor to activate the inactive complex of diol dehydratase with CN-Cbl was also examined in vitro because the inactive enzyme·CN-Cbl complex can be considered as a model of the inactivated holoenzyme. Fig. 3 A indicates that the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex is rapidly activated by the factor in the presence of AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+. This activation by the factor also required ATP/Mg2+ (Fig. 3 A) in addition to free AdoCbl (data not shown). Approximately 76% of the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex underwent activation by 20 min of incubation under the conditions. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the extent of reactivation was dependent on a molar ratio of the factor to the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex. From the double-reciprocal plot, the concentration of the factor giving half-maximal activation of 1.2 μm enzyme·CN-Cbl complex was calculated to be 3.5 μm. The reactivating factor, free AdoCbl, ATP, and Mg2+ were absolutely required for both reactivation of the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme and activation of the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex. ADP was not able to replace ATP. From the absolute requirement for free AdoCbl, it was strongly suggested that the reactivation of the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme and activation of the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex occurs by exchange of the enzyme-bound, modified coenzyme and CN-Cbl, respectively, for free intact AdoCbl. We have previously reported that the in situ reactivation of the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme or the in situactivation of inactive cobalamin-enzyme complexes takes place by exchange of enzyme-bound cobalamins for AdoCbl (13Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ushio K. Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To examine whether the reactivating factor mediates such exchange, the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex was subjected to incubation with and without the reactivating factor in the presence of AdePeCbl, ATP, and Mg2+, followed by dialysis to remove unbound cobalamins. AdePeCbl, an inactive analog of AdoCbl containing the adenine ring in the upper axial ligand, was used instead of AdoCbl itself because the complex of diol dehydratase with AdoCbl (regular holoenzyme) is catalytically active and rather susceptible to inactivation even in the presence of substrate (31Toraya T. Krodel E. Mildvan A.S. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig.4 A, the spectrum of the dialysate indicates that the enzyme-bound CN-Cbl was replaced by AdePeCbl with the reactivating factor. This exchange never occurred without the factor. Thus, it is evident that the reactivating factor mediates the exchange of the enzyme-bound CN-Cbl for free AdePeCbl. In contrast, the reverse was not the case. That is, the replacement of the enzyme-bound AdePeCbl by free CN-Cbl did not occur at all even with the factor in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ (Fig.4 B). Thus, it is quite likely that the reactivating factor mediates the exchange of enzyme-bound, adenine-lacking cobalamins for free, adenine-containing cobalamins. Because the coenzyme loses the adenine moiety by irreversible cleavage of the Co—C bond in the inactivation of holoenzymes by glycerol or O2, it can therefore be concluded that the reactivating factor reactivates the inactivated holoenzymes or activates the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex by mediating the ATP-dependent exchange of the enzyme-bound, modified coenzyme or CN-Cbl, i.e. adenine-lacking cobalamins, for free intact AdoCbl, i.e. an adenine-containing cobalamin. The data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 were obtained with 1,2-propanediol as substrate for measuring enzyme activity restored. Because 1,2-propanediol does not cause suicide inactivation at a significant rate, there remains a possibility that the reactivating factor may mediate only a single exchange. To test this possibility, the time course of glycerol dehydration was determined with and without the reactivating factor. As shown in Fig.5 A, this substrate brought about complete inactivation of the enzyme within 3 min. However, when the reactivating factor and ATP/Mg2+ were supplemented to the reaction mixture in addition to AdoCbl, an initial rapid phase of glycerol dehydration was followed by a slower but almost constant rate of the dehydration. Furthermore, when the reactivating factor was added to the completely inactivated enzyme together with ATP/Mg2+in the presence of free AdoCbl, the inactivated enzyme underwent rapid reactivation. The product formed increased linearly with time of incubation, although the rate of product formation with glycerol was much slower than that with 1,2-propanediol. As shown in Fig.5 B, the amount of the product formed by the reactivated enzyme in 4 h was dependent on a molar ratio of the factor to diol dehydratase. On the assumption that the probability of the mechanism-based inactivation by glycerol is not affected by the presence of the factor and ATP/Mg2+, the numbers of reactivation per diol dehydratase and per reactivating factor were calculated to reach 6 and 2, respectively. These numbers were 5.5 and 1.5, respectively, when the reaction was terminated at 100 min of incubation. It is therefore evident that diol dehydratase undergoes multiple reactivation during dehydration of glycerol. However, by taking the dimeric subunit structure of the factor into consideration, it was suggested that the reactivating factor failed in catalyzing multiple exchanges of tightly bound, modified coenzyme for exogenous AdoCbl on diol dehydratase under the experimental conditions employed. AdoCbl-dependent enzymatic reactions are initiated by homolysis of the Co—C bond of the enzyme-bound coenzyme and proceed via radical mechanisms (1Lee Jr., H.A. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2367-2373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Toraya T. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 30.

Rev. 1996; 25: 329-337Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Such reactions are considered to need the assistance of high reactivity of a free radical. Highly reactive radical intermediates must sustain their reactivity at the active sites and become extinct in the only way destined for the reaction. Once a radical intermediate becomes extinct or stabilized by side reactions, regeneration of AdoCbl becomes impossible, resulting in irreversible modification of the coenzyme (3Toraya T. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 30. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 217-254Google Scholar). This leads to inactivation of enzymes because the modified coenzymes remain tightly bound to enzymes and not exchangeable with free AdoCbl. Are such inactivated enzymes reactivated? This would be important for cellular economics of energy. The data presented in this paper gave at least one answer to this question. That is, the purified complex of the DdrA and DdrB proteins reactivates glycerol-inactivated and O2-inactivated holoenzymes. This result was as expected because the ddrABgenes were identified as the genes ofK. oxytoca encoding a putative reactivating factor for inactivated diol dehydratase (20Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Hara T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32034-32041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This is the first biochemical demonstration of such reactivation by these gene products. We have previously demonstrated with toluene-treated cells of K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniae (18Ushio K. Honda S. Toraya T. Fukui S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and recombinant E. coli harboring plasmid pUCDD11 (19Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that the complexes of diol dehydratase or glycerol dehydratase with CN-Cbl, aquacobalamin, and pentylcobalamin undergo in situ activation, whereas the complexes with adeninylbutylcobalamin and AdePeCbl do not. These facts suggest that the affinity of the enzyme for cobalamins lacking the adenine moiety in the upper axial ligand is selectively loweredin situ in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, resulting in replacement of these enzyme-bound cobalamins by free AdoCbl. It seemed likely that the binding affinity for the modified coenzymes in the glycerol-inactivated and O2-inactivated holoenzymes is also lowered in situ in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ because the adenosyl group is irreversibly severed from the cobalamin moiety during the inactivation processes (4Toraya T. Fukui S. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 233-262Google Scholar, 14Bachovchin W.W. Eagar Jr., R.G. Moore K.W. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1082-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,30Wagner O.W. Lee Jr., H.A. Frey P.A. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1751-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for such an exchange mechanism of reactivation was obtained here in vitro for the first time. It was demonstrated that the reactivating factor reactivates the inactivated holoenzyme or activates the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex by mediating the exchange of the enzyme-bound, adenine-lacking cobalamin for free AdoCbl, an adenine-containing cobalamin. Because the adenine-lacking cobalamins are also bound by diol dehydratase so tightly, such exchange never occurs without the reactivating factor. Complex formation between the factor and diol dehydratase was observed (data not shown). Therefore, it can be postulated that the reactivating factor selectively lowers the affinity of diol dehydratase for adenine-lacking cobalamins by forming a complex with the enzyme protein and transiently affecting its higher-order structures. The free energy required for such structural transitions may be provided by coupling with the hydrolysis of ATP because the reactivating factor shows low but distinct ATPase activity (data not shown). Non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs were not effective for the reactivation of the glycerol-inactivated holoenzyme and the activation of the enzyme·CN-Cbl complex. Such mechanism of action of the reactivating factor seems similar to those of molecular chaperones. In this sense, the diol dehydratase-reactivating factor may be considered as a new type of molecular chaperone which is involved in reactivation of inactivated enzymes. Detailed mechanism of action of the factor is under current investigation. The proteins homologous to the Ddr proteins were assumed to serve as a reactivating factor for inactivated glycerol dehydratase (20Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Hara T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32034-32041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, such reactivating factor may be a factor of general importance for AdoCbl-dependent enzymes.

This lectin exhibited hemagglutinating activity against human A-type erythrocytes, but not against the B- and O-types of erythrocytes and animal erythrocytes, including those of sheep, rabbit, horse, and bovine. The hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-3 was equivalent to that of a previously identified lectin, named tachylectin-2, with affinity forN-acetyl-d-glucosamine orN-acetyl-d-galactosamine. However, the activity of tachylectin-3 was not inhibited by these twoN-acetylhexosamines at 100 mm but was inhibited by a blood group A-pentasaccharide at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.16 mm. Furthermore, the hemagglutinating activity was strongly inhibited by bacterial S-type lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from Gram-negative bacteria but not by R-type LPSs lacking O-antigens. One of the most effective S-type LPSs was fromEscherichia coli O111:B4, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 6 ng/ml. These data suggest that tachylectin-3 specifically recognizes Gram-negative bacteria through the unique structural units of O-antigens. Ultracentrifugation analysis revealed that tachylectin-3 is present in dimer in solution. A cDNA coding for tachylectin-3 was isolated from a hemocyte cDNA library. Tachylectin-3 consisted of two repeating sequences, each with a partial sequence similarity to rinderpest virus neuraminidase. Tachylectin-3 and three previously isolated types of tachylectins were all predominantly expressed in hemocytes and released from hemocytes in response to external stimuli.

Immunity to infectious agents is mediated by two general systems, innate and acquired. Acquired immunity, found only in vertebrates, is one function of B and T lymphocytes, which produce an infinite multitude of specific antigen receptors and antibodies through somatic gene rearrangement. On the other hand, innate immunity is phylogenetically older than acquired immunity, and a certain form of innate immunity is present in all multicellular organisms. Non-self-recognizing proteins involved in innate immunity seem to recognize mainly carbohydrate moieties on pathogens; for instance, a receptor CD14 (1Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J.

Mizutani A. Tokunaga F. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 266: 137-147Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These granular hemocytes are filled with two populations of secretory granules, named large (L) and small (S) granules. These granules selectively store defense molecules, such as clotting serine protease zymogens, a clottable protein coagulogen, protease inhibitors, lectins, and antimicrobial peptides (4Iwanaga S.

Rev.). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The hemocytes are highly sensitive to LPSs, and these defense molecules stored in both granules are secreted by exocytosis after stimulation with LPSs. This response is important for the host defense related to engulfing and killing invading microbes, in addition to preventing the leakage of hemolymph.We reported evidence of several types of hemocyte-derived lectins, named tachylectins, which may play in a functional role of the innate immunity of this animal. Tachylectin-1, identical to an L-granule-derived protein L6 (12Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Kawasaki S. Seki N. Muta T. Toh Y. Ito A. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), binds to both S- and R-types of LPSs and inhibits the growth of Gram-negative bacteria (13Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Tachylectin-2, identical to another L-granule-derived protein, L10 (12Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Kawasaki S. Seki N. Muta T. Toh Y. Ito A. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), exhibits binding specificity to d-GlcNAc or d-GalNAc and agglutinates a certain strain of Staphylococcus (14Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Tachylectins-4 has affinity for l-fucose and binds to S-type LPSs from several Gram-negative bacteria through O-specific polysaccharides (O-antigens) (15Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have now identified a new type of the hemocyte-derived lectin, named tachylectin-3, which differs structurally and functionally from those of the tachylectins mentioned above. Tachylectins-3 has specificity for a blood group A antigen and recognizes specific O-antigens of bacterial lipopolysaccharides.DISCUSSIONWe newly identified a member of horseshoe crab hemocyte-derived lectins, named tachylectin-3. This lectin agglutinated specifically human A-type erythrocytes, like tachylectin-2 with specificity ford-GlcNAc or d-GalNAc (14Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-3 was equivalent to that of tachylectin-2, but the activity of tachylectin-3 was not inhibited by the addition of 100 mmd-GlcNAc or d-GalNAc (Table I). This activity of tachylectin-3 was completely inhibited by the blood group A-pentasaccharide at 0.16 mm. Furthermore, the activity was more strongly inhibited by S-type LPSs isolated from several strains of Gram-negative bacteria, but it was not inhibited by R-type LPSs (Table II). One of the most effective LPSs was fromE. coli O111:B4 with MIC of 0.006 μg/ml or 0.38 nm, based on an average molecular weight (M r = 15,800) of LPS from E. coliO111 (29Goldman R.C. White D. Ørskov F. Ørskov I. Rick P.D. Lewis M.S. Bhattacharjee A.K. Leive L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This LPS is also the best ligand for tachylectin-4, but a much higher concentration was required for recognition by tachylectin-4 (MIC = 0.1 μg/ml) (15Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, tachylectin-3, more strongly than tachylectin-4, specifically recognizes a certain chemical structure of O-antigens.Fig. 6 shows chemical structures of the A-pentasaccharide and repeating units of the O-antigens specifically recognized by tachylectin-3. In our previous report, we suggested that colitose (3-deoxy-l-fucose), a specific constituent of the O-antigens from several strains of E. coli, is the most probable ligand for tachylectin-4 (15Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Colitose, however, is not a specific ligand for tachylectin-3, because the inhibitory potency of LPSs from E. coli O127 and E. coli O128 containing no colitose in their O-antigens is equal to that of the colitose containing LPSs from E. coli O111 and E. coli O55 (30Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1994; 59: 1325-1383Google Scholar, 31Sengupta P. Bhattacharyya T. Shashkov A.S. Kochanowski H. Basu S. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 277: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, tachylectin-3 possibly recognizes more specific structural units of O-antigens, similar to that for blood group A antigen.Comparison of the chemical structures of the A-pentasaccharide and the O-antigens suggests a potential ligand for tachylectin-3 (Fig. 6,underlined). A disaccharide of Gal α1,3GalNAc or GalNAc α1,3GalNAc in the repeating units of O-antigens is shared in these O-antigens. In addition to this fact, the GalNAc α1,3Gal structure of the A-pentasaccharide is very similar to those of the repeating units of O-antigens. However, the potential candidate cannot explain the inability of the A-trisaccharide (GalNAc α1,3 [Fuc α1,2] Gal) to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-3, because the A-trisaccharide also contains the disaccharide of GalNAc α1,3Gal. Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) lectin binds to the A-trisaccharide and the A-tetrasaccharide of GalNAc α1,3 [Fuc α1,2] Gal β1,4Glc (32Sikder S.K. Kabat E.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 151: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lectin more strongly binds to the A-hexasaccharide of GalNAc α1–3 [Fuc α1,2] Gal β1,3GlcNAc β1,3Gal β1,4Glc than the A-trisaccharide. Galectin-3 with affinity for β-galactosides, such as lactose (Gal β1,4Glc) and lactosamine (Gal β1,4GlcNAc), also has an affinity for the A-tetrasaccharide, and the affinity is about 30-fold higher than that of lactose (33Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sparrow C.P. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like these lectins, tachylectin-3 may recognize an annexed structure, in addition to the disaccharide of the O-antigens. Tachylectin-3 probably contains interaction sites for the extended oligosaccharides in addition to the primary binding sites, termed as subsite multivalency (35Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tachylectin-3 forms a dimer in solution, and this dimeric form may lead to the increase in affinity for appropriate multivalent ligands, such as O-antigens of LPS, termed as subunit multivalency (35Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Further studies are required for identification of specific ligand of tachylectin-3.Mammalian lectins have been suggested to play an important role in host-pathogen interactions by specific recognition with cell surface substances of bacteria (36Mandrell R.E. Apicella M.A. Lindstedt R. Leffler H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 231-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, galectin-3, expressed in the cytosol of activated macrophages or epithelial cells, is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli through nonclassical pathways (37Sato S. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4424-4430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, galectin-3 binds to LPS and is likely to mediate interactions between host and pathogens (38Mey A. Leffler H. Hmama Z. Normier G. Revillard J.-P. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1572-1577PubMed Google Scholar). In the horseshoe crab, four types of lectins have been identified in the circulating hemocytes, and all are predominantly expressed in hemocytes and released from hemocytes in response to the external stimuli (Figs. 4and 5). Hence, they probably have a major functional role in host defense, including recognition, opsonization, and killing of invading microbes.Tachylectin-1 interacts with LPSs derived from both a wild-type and a rough-mutant of S. minnesota probably through the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate disaccharide, an essential constituent of LPS in most Gram-negative bacteria (13Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Tachylectin-1 also binds to polysaccharides such as agarose and dextran, and it is the most abundant lectin between tachylectins so far identified. This broad specificity of tachylectin-1, in addition to the abundant quantity stored in secretory granules of hemocytes, may be very important for primary pattern recognition (39Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbar Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Janeway Jr., C.A. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) against invading microbes. Tachylectin-2 recognizes staphylococcal LTA and several kinds of LPSs (Table II). In contrast, tachylectin-4 specifically binds to the S-type LPS from E. coli O111 through a certain sugar moiety on the O-antigen (15Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our newly identified tachylectin-3 exhibits much higher specificity than tachylectin-4 against O-antigens from several Gram-negative bacteria. Different types of lectins have been noted in hemolymph plasma (9Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. (J. B. Rev.). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, the innate immunity system of horseshoe crab may recognize invading pathogens through a combinatorial method by using lectins with high specificity and lectins with broad specificity against substances exposed on pathogens. An encounter with these lectins derived from hemocytes and hemolymph plasma at injured sites, in response to the stimulation of LPSs, suggest that they may serve, synergistically, to provide an effective host defense against invading microbes and foreign substances. Immunity to infectious agents is mediated by two general systems, innate and acquired. Acquired immunity, found only in vertebrates, is one function of B and T lymphocytes, which produce an infinite multitude of specific antigen receptors and antibodies through somatic gene rearrangement. On the other hand, innate immunity is phylogenetically older than acquired immunity, and a certain form of innate immunity is present in all multicellular organisms. Non-self-recognizing proteins involved in innate immunity seem to recognize mainly carbohydrate moieties on pathogens; for instance, a receptor CD14 (1Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J.

Furthermore, the innate immunity in invertebrates is also triggered by polysaccharides, such as LPSs and β-1,3-glucans, as seen in the hemolymph coagulation system in horseshoe crab (4Iwanaga S.

In the Japanese horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus, one of the major defense systems is carried by hemolymph that contains granular hemocytes comprising 99% of the total hemocytes (11Toh Y.

We reported evidence of several types of hemocyte-derived lectins, named tachylectins, which may play in a functional role of the innate immunity of this animal. Tachylectin-1, identical to an L-granule-derived protein L6 (12Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Kawasaki S. Seki N. Muta T. Toh Y. Ito A. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), binds to both S- and R-types of LPSs and inhibits the growth of Gram-negative bacteria (13Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Tachylectin-2, identical to another L-granule-derived protein, L10 (12Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Kawasaki S. Seki N. Muta T. Toh Y. Ito A. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), exhibits binding specificity to d-GlcNAc or d-GalNAc and agglutinates a certain strain of Staphylococcus (14Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Tachylectins-4 has affinity for l-fucose and binds to S-type LPSs from several Gram-negative bacteria through O-specific polysaccharides (O-antigens) (15Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have now identified a new type of the hemocyte-derived lectin, named tachylectin-3, which differs structurally and functionally from those of the tachylectins mentioned above. Tachylectins-3 has specificity for a blood group A antigen and recognizes specific O-antigens of bacterial lipopolysaccharides. DISCUSSIONWe newly identified a member of horseshoe crab hemocyte-derived lectins, named tachylectin-3. This lectin agglutinated specifically human A-type erythrocytes, like tachylectin-2 with specificity ford-GlcNAc or d-GalNAc (14Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-3 was equivalent to that of tachylectin-2, but the activity of tachylectin-3 was not inhibited by the addition of 100 mmd-GlcNAc or d-GalNAc (Table I). This activity of tachylectin-3 was completely inhibited by the blood group A-pentasaccharide at 0.16 mm. Furthermore, the activity was more strongly inhibited by S-type LPSs isolated from several strains of Gram-negative bacteria, but it was not inhibited by R-type LPSs (Table II). One of the most effective LPSs was fromE. coli O111:B4 with MIC of 0.006 μg/ml or 0.38 nm, based on an average molecular weight (M r = 15,800) of LPS from E. coliO111 (29Goldman R.C. White D. Ørskov F. Ørskov I. Rick P.D. Lewis M.S. Bhattacharjee A.K. Leive L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This LPS is also the best ligand for tachylectin-4, but a much higher concentration was required for recognition by tachylectin-4 (MIC = 0.1 μg/ml) (15Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, tachylectin-3, more strongly than tachylectin-4, specifically recognizes a certain chemical structure of O-antigens.Fig. 6 shows chemical structures of the A-pentasaccharide and repeating units of the O-antigens specifically recognized by tachylectin-3. In our previous report, we suggested that colitose (3-deoxy-l-fucose), a specific constituent of the O-antigens from several strains of E. coli, is the most probable ligand for tachylectin-4 (15Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Colitose, however, is not a specific ligand for tachylectin-3, because the inhibitory potency of LPSs from E. coli O127 and E. coli O128 containing no colitose in their O-antigens is equal to that of the colitose containing LPSs from E. coli O111 and E. coli O55 (30Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1994; 59: 1325-1383Google Scholar, 31Sengupta P. Bhattacharyya T. Shashkov A.S. Kochanowski H. Basu S. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 277: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, tachylectin-3 possibly recognizes more specific structural units of O-antigens, similar to that for blood group A antigen.Comparison of the chemical structures of the A-pentasaccharide and the O-antigens suggests a potential ligand for tachylectin-3 (Fig. 6,underlined). A disaccharide of Gal α1,3GalNAc or GalNAc α1,3GalNAc in the repeating units of O-antigens is shared in these O-antigens. In addition to this fact, the GalNAc α1,3Gal structure of the A-pentasaccharide is very similar to those of the repeating units of O-antigens. However, the potential candidate cannot explain the inability of the A-trisaccharide (GalNAc α1,3 [Fuc α1,2] Gal) to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-3, because the A-trisaccharide also contains the disaccharide of GalNAc α1,3Gal. Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) lectin binds to the A-trisaccharide and the A-tetrasaccharide of GalNAc α1,3 [Fuc α1,2] Gal β1,4Glc (32Sikder S.K. Kabat E.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 151: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lectin more strongly binds to the A-hexasaccharide of GalNAc α1–3 [Fuc α1,2] Gal β1,3GlcNAc β1,3Gal β1,4Glc than the A-trisaccharide. Galectin-3 with affinity for β-galactosides, such as lactose (Gal β1,4Glc) and lactosamine (Gal β1,4GlcNAc), also has an affinity for the A-tetrasaccharide, and the affinity is about 30-fold higher than that of lactose (33Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sparrow C.P. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol.

Tachylectin-3 probably contains interaction sites for the extended oligosaccharides in addition to the primary binding sites, termed as subsite multivalency (35Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Furthermore, tachylectin-3 forms a dimer in solution, and this dimeric form may lead to the increase in affinity for appropriate multivalent ligands, such as O-antigens of LPS, termed as subunit multivalency (35Rini J.M.

Further studies are required for identification of specific ligand of tachylectin-3.Mammalian lectins have been suggested to play an important role in host-pathogen interactions by specific recognition with cell surface substances of bacteria (36Mandrell R.E. Apicella M.A. Lindstedt R. Leffler H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 231-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, galectin-3, expressed in the cytosol of activated macrophages or epithelial cells, is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli through nonclassical pathways (37Sato S. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4424-4430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, galectin-3 binds to LPS and is likely to mediate interactions between host and pathogens (38Mey A.

In the horseshoe crab, four types of lectins have been identified in the circulating hemocytes, and all are predominantly expressed in hemocytes and released from hemocytes in response to the external stimuli (Figs. 4and 5). Hence, they probably have a major functional role in host defense, including recognition, opsonization, and killing of invading microbes.Tachylectin-1 interacts with LPSs derived from both a wild-type and a rough-mutant of S. minnesota probably through the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate disaccharide, an essential constituent of LPS in most Gram-negative bacteria (13Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Tachylectin-1 also binds to polysaccharides such as agarose and dextran, and it is the most abundant lectin between tachylectins so far identified. This broad specificity of tachylectin-1, in addition to the abundant quantity stored in secretory granules of hemocytes, may be very important for primary pattern recognition (39Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbar Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Janeway Jr., C.A. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) against invading microbes. Tachylectin-2 recognizes staphylococcal LTA and several kinds of LPSs (Table II). In contrast, tachylectin-4 specifically binds to the S-type LPS from E. coli O111 through a certain sugar moiety on the O-antigen (15Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our newly identified tachylectin-3 exhibits much higher specificity than tachylectin-4 against O-antigens from several Gram-negative bacteria. Different types of lectins have been noted in hemolymph plasma (9Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. (J. B. Rev.). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, the innate immunity system of horseshoe crab may recognize invading pathogens through a combinatorial method by using lectins with high specificity and lectins with broad specificity against substances exposed on pathogens. An encounter with these lectins derived from hemocytes and hemolymph plasma at injured sites, in response to the stimulation of LPSs, suggest that they may serve, synergistically, to provide an effective host defense against invading microbes and foreign substances. We newly identified a member of horseshoe crab hemocyte-derived lectins, named tachylectin-3. This lectin agglutinated specifically human A-type erythrocytes, like tachylectin-2 with specificity ford-GlcNAc or d-GalNAc (14Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-3 was equivalent to that of tachylectin-2, but the activity of tachylectin-3 was not inhibited by the addition of 100 mmd-GlcNAc or d-GalNAc (Table I). This activity of tachylectin-3 was completely inhibited by the blood group A-pentasaccharide at 0.16 mm. Furthermore, the activity was more strongly inhibited by S-type LPSs isolated from several strains of Gram-negative bacteria, but it was not inhibited by R-type LPSs (Table II). One of the most effective LPSs was fromE. coli O111:B4 with MIC of 0.006 μg/ml or 0.38 nm, based on an average molecular weight (M r = 15,800) of LPS from E. coliO111 (29Goldman R.C. White D. Ørskov F. Ørskov I. Rick P.D. Lewis M.S. Bhattacharjee A.K. Leive L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This LPS is also the best ligand for tachylectin-4, but a much higher concentration was required for recognition by tachylectin-4 (MIC = 0.1 μg/ml) (15Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, tachylectin-3, more strongly than tachylectin-4, specifically recognizes a certain chemical structure of O-antigens. Fig. 6 shows chemical structures of the A-pentasaccharide and repeating units of the O-antigens specifically recognized by tachylectin-3. In our previous report, we suggested that colitose (3-deoxy-l-fucose), a specific constituent of the O-antigens from several strains of E. coli, is the most probable ligand for tachylectin-4 (15Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Colitose, however, is not a specific ligand for tachylectin-3, because the inhibitory potency of LPSs from E. coli O127 and E. coli O128 containing no colitose in their O-antigens is equal to that of the colitose containing LPSs from E. coli O111 and E. coli O55 (30Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1994; 59: 1325-1383Google Scholar, 31Sengupta P. Bhattacharyya T. Shashkov A.S. Kochanowski H. Basu S. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 277: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, tachylectin-3 possibly recognizes more specific structural units of O-antigens, similar to that for blood group A antigen. Comparison of the chemical structures of the A-pentasaccharide and the O-antigens suggests a potential ligand for tachylectin-3 (Fig. 6,underlined). A disaccharide of Gal α1,3GalNAc or GalNAc α1,3GalNAc in the repeating units of O-antigens is shared in these O-antigens. In addition to this fact, the GalNAc α1,3Gal structure of the A-pentasaccharide is very similar to those of the repeating units of O-antigens. However, the potential candidate cannot explain the inability of the A-trisaccharide (GalNAc α1,3 [Fuc α1,2] Gal) to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-3, because the A-trisaccharide also contains the disaccharide of GalNAc α1,3Gal. Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) lectin binds to the A-trisaccharide and the A-tetrasaccharide of GalNAc α1,3 [Fuc α1,2] Gal β1,4Glc (32Sikder S.K. Kabat E.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 151: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lectin more strongly binds to the A-hexasaccharide of GalNAc α1–3 [Fuc α1,2] Gal β1,3GlcNAc β1,3Gal β1,4Glc than the A-trisaccharide. Galectin-3 with affinity for β-galactosides, such as lactose (Gal β1,4Glc) and lactosamine (Gal β1,4GlcNAc), also has an affinity for the A-tetrasaccharide, and the affinity is about 30-fold higher than that of lactose (33Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sparrow C.P. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like these lectins, tachylectin-3 may recognize an annexed structure, in addition to the disaccharide of the O-antigens. Tachylectin-3 probably contains interaction sites for the extended oligosaccharides in addition to the primary binding sites, termed as subsite multivalency (35Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tachylectin-3 forms a dimer in solution, and this dimeric form may lead to the increase in affinity for appropriate multivalent ligands, such as O-antigens of LPS, termed as subunit multivalency (35Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Further studies are required for identification of specific ligand of tachylectin-3. Mammalian lectins have been suggested to play an important role in host-pathogen interactions by specific recognition with cell surface substances of bacteria (36Mandrell R.E. Apicella M.A. Lindstedt R. Leffler H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 231-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, galectin-3, expressed in the cytosol of activated macrophages or epithelial cells, is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli through nonclassical pathways (37Sato S. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4424-4430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, galectin-3 binds to LPS and is likely to mediate interactions between host and pathogens (38Mey A. Leffler H. Hmama Z. Normier G. Revillard J.-P. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1572-1577PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2027581706,"Growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiaewith a fatty acid as carbon source was shown previously to require function of either glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (ZWF1) or cytosolic NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP2), suggesting dependence of β-oxidation on a cytosolic source of NADPH. In this study, we find that ΔIDP2ΔZWF1 strains containing disruptions in genes encoding both enzymes exhibit a rapid loss of viability when transferred to medium containing oleate as the carbon source. This loss of viability is not observed following transfer of a ΔIDP3 strain lacking peroxisomal isocitrate dehydrogenase to medium with docosahexaenoate, a nonpermissive carbon source that requires function of IDP3 for β-oxidation. This suggests that the fatty acid− phenotype ofΔIDP2ΔZWF1 strains is not a simple defect in utilization. Instead, we propose that the common function shared by IDP2 and ZWF1 is maintenance of significant levels of NADPH for enzymatic removal of the hydrogen peroxide generated in the first step of peroxisomal β-oxidation in yeast and that inadequate levels of the reduced form of the cofactor can produce lethality. This proposal is supported by the finding that the sensitivity to exogenous hydrogen peroxide previously reported for ΔZWF1 mutant strains is less pronounced when analyses are conducted with a nonfermentable carbon source, a condition associated with elevated expression of IDP2. Under those conditions, similar slow growth phenotypes are observed forΔZWF1 and ΔIDP2 strains, and co-disruption of both genes dramatically exacerbates the H2O2s phenotype. Collectively, these results suggest that IDP2, when expressed, and ZWF1 have critical overlapping functions in provision of reducing equivalents for defense against endogenous or exogenous sources of H2O2.

Collectively, these results suggest that IDP2, when expressed, and ZWF1 have critical overlapping functions in provision of reducing equivalents for defense against endogenous or exogenous sources of H2O2. Reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH are essential for many enzymatic steps involved in biosynthesis of cellular macromolecules. NADPH is also the essential cofactor for glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent enzymes that constitute major cellular defenses against oxidative damage (reviewed in Refs. 1Wells W.W. Yang Y. Deits T.L. Gan Z.-R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 66: 149-201PubMed Google Scholar and 2Halliwell B. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In eucaryotic cells, the majority of these NADPH-dependent reactions occur in the cytosol. Availability of the reduced form of the cofactor requires maintenance of high steady-state cytosolic redox ratios for NADPH:NADP+ and values as high as ∼70:1 have been reported (3Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1988: 431Google Scholar).Enzymatic sources of NADPH are relatively few in number. In a recent study (4Minard K.I. Jennings G.T. Loftus T.M. Xuan D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31486-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we utilized gene disruption and phenotype analyses to examine the relative contributions by the oxidative branch of the hexose monophosphate pathway and by differentially compartmentalized isozymes of NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenases inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Results indicate that yeast cells are remarkably flexible in terms of enzymatic sources of NADPH for growth, since mutants containing multiple gene disruptions grow well under various cultivation conditions. In fact, the only dramatic growth phenotypes observed were the inability of strains containing co-disruptions of genes encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (ZWF1) and cytosolic NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP2) to grow with fatty acids as a carbon source and the inability of homozygous ΔIDP2ΔZWF1 diploid strains to sporulate.In this report, we further examine the fatty acid− growth phenotype demonstrated by ΔIDP2ΔZWF1 yeast disruption mutants. This phenotype is not observed for mutant strains containing a single gene disruption of ZWF1 or of IDP2, and the mutant strain containing both gene disruptions is capable of growth on acetate as a carbon source (4Minard K.I. Jennings G.T. Loftus T.M. Xuan D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31486-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ZWF1 and IDP1 have some overlapping function in support of β-oxidation of fatty acids, a process that is strictly peroxisomal in S. cerevisiae (reviewed in Refs. 5Harder W. Veenhuis M. Rose A.H. Harrison J.S. The Yeasts. 3. Academic Press, New York1989: 261-288Google Scholar and 6Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar).Disruption of the yeast ZWF1 gene has been reported to result in methionine (and cysteine) auxotrophy and an increased sensitivity to oxidizing agents including hydrogen peroxide and diamide (7Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The Met− phenotype has been interpreted as a deficiency in NADPH required for a thioredoxin-dependent reaction in methionine/cysteine biosynthesis (9Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The H2O2s phenotype may reflect insufficient levels of NADPH to combat oxidative stress. Results of several recent studies support the importance of the hexose monophosphate pathway in this stress response; Juhnke et al. (10Juhnke H. Krems B. Kotter P. Entian K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) report that H2O2s is a common phenotype for yeast mutants with defects in enzymes of this pathway. Based on results of complementation studies, Slekar et al. (9Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) suggest that the methionine auxotrophy displayed by yeast strains lacking the cytosolic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is due to a drain of NADPH from biosynthetic pools and that increased flux through the hexose monophosphate pathway can alleviate this auxotrophy inSOD1 disruption mutants. In addition, Godon et al. (11Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) reported recently that overall changes in expression of various cellular proteins in yeast cells following exposure to hydrogen peroxide suggest a major redirection of carbon flux from glycolysis into the hexose monophosphate pathway.These previous studies of ZWF1 function were conducted using yeast cells grown with glucose as a carbon source, a condition that represses expression of IDP2 (12Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12116-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Loftus T.M. Hall L.V. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We report here that, under conditions when IDP2 is normally expressed, disruption of IDP2 or ofZWF1 produces similar phenotypes and growth defects are compounded by co-disruption of both genes. Also, we provide evidence that, in addition to a requirement for either ZWF1 or IDP2 to support growth with fatty acids as a carbon source, the absence of both enzymes results in rapid loss of viability. We suggest that the cause of lethality is probably oxidative damage due to accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, a major byproduct of peroxisomal β-oxidation, and that significant levels of cytosolic NADPH are normally required for efficient degradation of that metabolite in vivo.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS. cerevisiae cells are able to utilize fatty acids as carbon sources because the acetyl CoA produced by peroxisomal β-oxidation serves as a substrate both for energy metabolism and for net carbon biosynthesis via the glyoxylate pathway (reviewed in Ref.21Lazarow P.B.

Growth of yeast on oleate ((9) oleic acid (C18:1)) results in proliferation of peroxisomes and in dramatic elevation of expression of peroxisomal enzymes, including the β-oxidation enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 5Harder W.

In contrast to these peroxisomal enzymes, cytosolic catalase (CTT1, Ref.22Skoneczny M. Chelstowska A. Rytka J. Eur. J.

Below each lane is shown an average of values from two independent experiments for NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase specific activity. Under these conditions, the antiserum does not react with the IDP3 polypeptide, presumably because the isozyme contributes only ∼15% of the total cellular activity in oleate-grown cells (23Henke B.

Other than replication of the growth phenotypes (e.g. petroselenate−) described by others for strains with IDP3 gene disruptions (17Van Roermund C.W.T. Hettema W.H. Kal A.J. Van den Berg M.

As illustrated in Fig.3 A, logarithmic-phase doubling times of ∼8 h with oleate were measured for the parental strain, whereas the mutant strain containing both gene disruptions exhibits a rapid decline in viability when shifted to oleate as carbon source. The decrease in viable cell numbers for the ΔIDP2ΔZWF1strain contrasts sharply with results obtained following a shift of the parental culture to medium with no added carbon source (Fig.3 A); the parental culture ceases to grow after an initial doubling but exhibits no loss of viability over this 60-h period. Instead, the decrease in viability for the ΔIDP2ΔZWF1mutant strain is similar to but slower than the lethality produced by shifting a parental culture to oleate medium containing Geneticin (G418) at levels used for selective protocols. The calculatedt 12 values for loss of viability are ∼16 h for the ΔIDP2ΔZWF1 strain in medium with oleate and ∼4 h for the parental strain in medium with oleate plus Geneticin.Figure 3Growth and viability of yeast strains shifted to medium with a fatty acid carbon source. Parental and mutant yeast strains were cultivated in YP medium with a fatty acid or no carbon source as indicated. Viable cell numbers (log scale) were determined by plating dilutions from the cultures onto YP glucose plates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All cultures were initiated with 2–3 × 106 viable cells/ml, and these initial numbers are normalized to one for comparison. Each point represents an average of two or three values obtained from independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results suggest that transfer of the ΔIDP2ΔZWF1strain to medium with a fatty acid carbon source activates an endogenous cellular mechanism that results in lethality. The time lag (∼12 h) before loss of viability is measurable (Fig. 3 A), relative to that observed with the parental strain with Geneticin, may be due induction of this mechanism as the cells adapt to oleate as a carbon source. Thus, a potential cause of lethality in theΔIDP2ΔZWF1 strain is accumulation of toxic levels of H2O2 during the process of β-oxidation (Fig.1), which is induced by this shift. To examine this possibility, similar shifts were conducted using a ΔIDP3 mutant strain. Counts of viable cell numbers (Fig. 3 B) give a doubling time of ∼7 h with oleate, a permissive carbon source for this strain, since β-oxidation does not require a peroxisomal source of NADPH (17Van Roermund C.W.T.

Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 3702-3711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, when shifted to medium with docosahexaenoate, a nonpermissive fatty acid carbon source, growth of theΔIDP3 strain (Fig. 3 B) resembles that of the parental strain shifted to no carbon source (Fig. 3 A). The parental strain exhibits a doubling time of ∼11 h with docosahexaenoate (Fig. 3 B). Significantly, there is little loss of viability for the ΔIDP3 mutant strain in docosahexaenoate medium over the time frame of this experiment. In this mutant strain, as illustrated in Fig. 1, docosahexaenoate is expected to be a substrate for acyl-CoA synthetase and oxidase but to undergo no further metabolism in the absence of NADPH normally generated by IDP3.Van Roermund et al. (17Van Roermund C.W.T. Hettema W.H. Kal A.J. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Waners R.J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have demonstrated an accumulation of the enoyl CoA product of acyl oxidation in a ΔIDP3strain incubated with docosahexaenoate, suggesting that some H2O2 is also produced. The absence of lethality for the ΔIDP3 strain in medium with docosahexaenoate as carbon source may thus be due to the presence of normal cellular mechanisms (e.g. ZWF1 and IDP2) for removal of this toxic intermediate and/or to reduced production of this metabolite by acyl-CoA oxidase. To try to distinguish between these possibilities, we examined growth responses of a strain containing disruptions ofIDP2, ZWF1, and IDP3 loci. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, a shift of theΔIDP2ΔZWF1ΔIDP3 strain to docosahexaenoate medium produces a decrease of approximately 20% in viable cell numbers after 12 h, but these numbers do not change significantly over the time course of the experiment. In contrast, theΔIDP2ΔZWF1ΔIDP3 mutant strain exhibits a significant loss of viability (t 12 ≈ 12 h) following a shift to oleate medium. Our interpretation of these results is that this loss of viability is due to production of H2O2 in multiple rounds of β-oxidation when oleate is the substrate. The absence of this dramatic loss of viability for the mutant strain when docosahexaenoate is the substrate suggests that production of H2O2 may be limited, perhaps due to product inhibition of oxidase activity.To try to compare intracellular levels of H2O2, we used 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, a fluorescent probe previously used to measure cellular oxidant production in mammalian (24Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) and yeast cells (18Lee S.M. Park J.-W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 25Brennan R.J. Schiestl R.H. Mutat. Res. 1998; 403: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This compound is believed to cross cell membranes by passive diffusion, to be trapped after deacetylation by intracellular esterases, and to undergo oxidation by reactive oxygen species to form a fluorescent dichlorofluorescein derivative. Measurements were made with cultures grown with a fatty acid for 24 h, a time chosen to ensure adaptation to this carbon source but prior to any significant decrease in cell number (Fig. 3). As shown in Table I, two different series of experiments produced different absolute but similar relative fluorescence values. These values are consistent with significant increases in intracellular oxidant levels in ΔIDP2ΔZWF1and ΔIDP2ΔZWF1ΔIDP3 strains cultivated with oleate and a slight increase in these levels in the ΔIDP3 strain cultivated with oleate. Fluorescence differences were not measurable with other strains and growth conditions. Thus, increased fluorescence appears to correlate with conditions that lead to loss of culture viability.Table IFluorescence of cellular extracts following culture exposure to dichlorofluoresceinStrainIncrease in fluorescence/mg of cellular proteinaYeast strains were cultivated for 24 h as described in the legend for Fig. 3 in YP medium with the indicated fatty acid as carbon source.

Open table in a new tab Collectively, these results suggest that either ZWF1 or IDP2 is essential to prevent the loss of viability that otherwise occurs during β-oxidation in yeast cells. We propose that the shared function is maintenance of high cytosolic redox ratios to ensure efficient function of NADPH-dependent enzymes involved in degradation of H2O2 or in prevention of oxidative damage from that metabolite and that these thiol-dependent reactions are an essential adjunct to catalase function (Fig. 1).One correlate of this proposal is that IDP2, when expressed, may alleviate some of the detrimental effects (e.g.H2O2s) reported previously for disruption of ZWF1 (8Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and, conversely, that co-disruption of IDP2 may exacerbate these effects. This was tested by comparing growth of parental and mutant strains on plates with YP medium containing as the carbon source either glucose, which represses expression of IDP2, or ethanol, which is conducive to IDP2 expression (12Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12116-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Effects on growth with both carbon sources of addition of H2O2 was tested by titration on a series of plates; results with concentrations (1 mm) producing definitive effects are illustrated in Fig.4 A. As expected, on plates with glucose as the carbon source, the H2O2s phenotypes are comparable forΔZWF1 and ΔIDP2ΔZWF1 strains, whereas the ΔIDP2 strain exhibits resistance equivalent to that of the parental strain. With ethanol as a carbon source, however, both theΔZWF1 strain and the ΔIDP2 strain exhibit reduced growth (colony size) relative to the parental strain with concentrations of H2O2 that clearly eliminate growth of the ΔIDP2ΔZWF1 strain. These results suggest a “synthetic lethal” relationship between these cytosolic sources of NADPH for protection from exogenous H2O2 when both are expressed. Interestingly, despite this apparently essential function, levels of ZWF1 are elevated at most 2-fold (11Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and levels of IDP2 are not significantly elevated (data not shown) in cells exposed to H2O2 under conditions that result in over 10-fold increases in levels of other proteins with antioxidant functions including cytosolic catalase and thioredoxin reductase (11Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol.

A, parental and mutant yeast strains were streaked as indicated onto YP agar plates (±1.0 mmH2O2) containing either glucose or ethanol as the carbon source, and the plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 (glucose) or 4 days (ethanol). B, the same strains were streaked onto YNB agar plates with all necessary auxotrophic supplements except methionine and with either glucose or glycerol/ethanol as the carbon source and the plates incubated at 30 °C for 3 days (glucose) or 5 days (ethanol).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since ΔZWF1 mutant strains are also reported to be methionine auxotrophs on glucose medium, we planned similar experiments to examine potential compensation by IDP2 on nonfermentable carbon sources. However, as illustrated in Fig. 4 B, while the methionine auxotrophies of ΔZWF1 andΔIDP2ΔZWF1 mutant strains are clearly apparent on plates with glucose as the carbon source, no obvious growth phenotypes are exhibited by any of the mutant strains on plates with glycerol/ethanol as the carbon source. Thus, methionine biosynthesis on nonfermentable carbon sources apparently does not require ZWF1 and/or IDP2. Since a specific reaction in this biosynthetic pathway, that catalyzed by NADPH/thioredoxin-dependent phosphoadenyl sulfate reductase, is believed to be the site affected by disruption ofZWF1 in glucose-grown cells (9Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), it would appear that there is an alternative source(s) of NADPH for this reaction under other growth conditions.In this report, we provide evidence that the process of β-oxidation in peroxisomes can be lethal in the absence of major sources of cytosolic NADPH. The most logical cause of lethality is damage resulting from accumulation of H2O2, a stoichiometric product of each round of oxidation. Accumulation of H2O2 is believed to be particularly hazardous because of the increased potential for generation of hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) by the iron-mediated Fenton reaction (26Henle E.S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19095-19098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). We propose that maintenance of a significant cytosolic pool of the reduced form of the NADP(H) cofactor is an essential adjunct to catalase function during this challenge and that the most likely fate of the reducing equivalents may be delivery to thioredoxin/glutathione-dependent peroxidases via respective reductases for enzymatic removal of H2O2 (Fig. 1). For S. cerevisiae, a thioredoxin peroxidase (also called thiol-specific antioxidant protein) has been described and kinetically characterized (27Chae H.Z. Kim I.-H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based"

Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Recently, CSPs were also found inAquifex aeolicus (2Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V.

Biol. 1998; 5: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), indicating that CSPs were present at the origin of bacterial divergence and therefore are presumably an evolutionarily old class of proteins. A CSP-homologous domain (cold shock domain) is found in many eukaryotic nucleic acid-binding proteins (for review see Ref. 4Sommerville J. Ladomery M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), where it confers specific RNA binding (5Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol.

CSPs bind to single-stranded DNA and RNA in a cooperative manner and with low sequence specificity (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol.

As a model for the cold shock domain, the structures of CspB (B. subtilis) and CspA (E. coli) were solved, revealing similar, compact five-stranded β-barrel folds (10Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R.

A. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CSPs possess binding sites for single-stranded nucleic acids on their antiparallel three-stranded β-sheets, which involve basic and aromatic residues. These are the so-called RNA-binding ribonucleoprotein motifs (13Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,14Schröder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).CSPs were discovered originally because they are strongly induced in response to cold shock (15Jones P.G. Van Bogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and thus they were assumed to be important for adaptation to low temperatures. The major cold shock protein, CspA from E. coli, was in fact shown to increase the synthesis of several cold stress-inducible proteins after a decrease in temperature (16Jones P.G. Krah R. Tafuri S. Wolffe A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5798-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, different members of the E. coli CSP family are regulated differently and appear to perform functions also during cell division or during the stationary phase (17Yamanaka K. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Recent work shows that in B. subtilis, CSPs are essential for protein synthesis at low as well as at optimal temperature and also during the stationary phase (8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, CspA from E. colidestabilizes secondary and tertiary structures in RNA in vitro (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), which led to the assumption that CSPs facilitate initiation of translation as “RNA chaperones” by preventing the formation of stable, nonproductive secondary structures in mRNA under various conditions.Induction of CSPs after cold shock originates from an increase in transcription of their genes (18Jiang W. Jones P. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5824-5828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, to a greater extent, from the stabilization of their mRNAs (19Brandi A. Pietroni P. Gualerzı́ C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, thecspA-mRNA seems to be translated more efficiently than the mRNAs coding for proteins that are not induced by cold stress (21Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Whether the concentration of CSPs is also regulated on the level of protein stability is not yet known. CspB from B. subtilisexhibits a very low conformational stability, and its native form exists in an extremely dynamic equilibrium with the unfolded form. The average lifetime of the folded conformation is only about 100 ms under physiological conditions. Therefore, we proposed that CspB might be subject to rapid degradation in vivo (22Schindler T. Herrler M. Marahiel M.A. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).The three members of the CSP family from B. subtilis show sequence identities of 72–80% (Table I) and can complement each otherin vivo (8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). CspB is important both at low and at optimal temperatures. CspC functions mainly at low temperature and CspD mainly at optimal temperature.Table ISequence alignment of the CSP protein family in B. subtilisProteinSequence%RNP1 RNP2CspDMQNGKVKWFNNEKGFGFIEVEGGDDVFVHFTAIEGDGYKSLEEGQEVSFEIVEGNRGPQASNVVK-L78aIdentity with CspB./85bSimilarity to CspB.: ::::::: ::::::::::: :::::::.:: :.:.:.::::: :::::::::::::: :: :CspBMLEGKVKWFNSEKGFGFIEVEGQDDVFVHFSAIQGEGFKTLEEGQAVSFEIVEGNRGPQAANVTKEA: : ::::: :::::::: : ::::::::::: .:::.:.::: :::.. : :: ::::: : :CspCMEQGTVKWFNAEKGFGFIERENGDDVFVHFSAIQSDGFKSLDEGQKVSFDVEQGARGAQAANVQK-A71/79CspB is the reference molecule for this sequence alignment.

Open table in a new tab Here we investigated the stability and the folding kinetics of CspC and CspD of B. subtilis. These two cold shock proteins resemble CspB in their rapid unfolding and refolding and in their low thermodynamic stability. Marginal stability linked with high conformational dynamics might be an effective means for regulating the cellular concentration of CSPs. To explore this possibility, we investigated the proteolytic stabilities of CspB, CspC, and CspDin vitro. The proteolytic susceptibility of all three proteins is in fact high but decreases strongly in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of single-stranded nucleic acids. In vivo, CspB and CspD, but not CspC, were stable at 37 and at 15 °C. CspC was significantly stabilized after a cold shock. These findings suggest that CSPs are complexed with a nucleic acid ligand in the cell, under cold shock conditions as well as at 37 °C, and are thereby protected against proteolytic attack.DISCUSSIONThe CSPs of B. subtilis (CspB, CspC, CspD, sequence identity 71–78%) share a common three-dimensional structure (10Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 12Schindelin H. Jiang W. Inouye M. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CspB folds extremely rapidly and reversibly without any intermediate steps and has a very low kinetic barrier to unfolding (22Schindler T. Herrler M. Marahiel M.A. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Similarly rapid two-state unfolding and refolding kinetics were found also for CspC and CspD in this work. These properties are likely to be general features of CSPs, because recently they were also found for CSPs from other mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic bacteria (3Perl D. Welker C. Schindler T. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Jaenicke R. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar,31Reid K.L. Rodriguez H.M. Hillier B.J. Gregoret L.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).CspB and CspD of B. subtilis show virtually identical low thermodynamic stabilities of −10 to −11 kJ/mol, and the stability of CspC is further reduced to only −6 kJ/mol. As a result, 8% of CspC molecules are expected to be denatured even under native conditions, compared with 1% for CspB. Interestingly, in CspC, Pro-58 of CspB and CspD is replaced by alanine (Table I). This substitution probably contributes to the reduced conformational stability of CspC because Pro residues reduce the entropy of the unfolded protein. All three CSPs feature a highly dynamic native conformation. CspB and CspD show almost identical rates of unfolding (12 s−1) and refolding (1000 s−1). Refolding of CspC is decelerated 8-fold, which reflects its lowered stability, but it also unfolds at a rate of 12 s−1 under native conditions.Consistent with their low thermodynamic stability and high frequency of unfolding, we found that all three CSPs of B. subtilis are excellent substrates for proteases in vitro. Their susceptibilities parallel the rank order of conformational stability; CspD is slightly more resistant to proteolytic degradation than CspB, whereas CspC with its particularly low thermodynamic stability is degraded most rapidly.The pulse-chase experiments in Fig. 7 show that, despite this rapid proteolysis of the purified proteins in vitro, CspB and CspD are not detectably degraded during logarithmic growth of B. subtilis at 37 °C. This result is in agreement with the finding that the CSPs have an essential function at optimal temperature (8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). CspC is degraded at 37 °C with a half-life of about 75 min. CspB and CspD are readily detectable in Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE from cells grown at 37 °C, whereas CspC is only faintly visible by Western blotting at this temperature (data not shown). After cold shock, all three CSPs were stable for at least 36 h (>1 doubling time). Thus, in the absence of a detectable turnover, enhanced synthesis following cold shock (29Graumann P. Schröder K. Schmid R. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4611-4619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) leads to an increase in the intracellular concentrations of CSPs. The different in vivo CSP stabilities agree with earlier findings that the function of CspC is more important at low temperatures, whereas CspB performs its function, which is not transient, at optimal growth temperature as well as under cold shock conditions (8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).CspA of E. coli has also been reported to be stable after cold shock at 10 °C. For its stability at 37 °C, contradictory results have been obtained. Pulse labeling of cold-shocked cells followed by a chase at low temperature and subsequent shift to optimal growth temperature was reported to produce CspA that could still be detected after several hours at 37 °C (32Goldstein J. Pollitt S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). On the other hand, induction of cspA from a heterologous promoter and pulse-chase of CspA at 37 °C resulted in protein with a rather short half-life (7 min under the experimental conditions employed) (19Brandi A. Pietroni P. Gualerzı́ C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Induction of CSPs by cold shock originates from increased transcription of csp genes and from stabilization of cspmRNAs (18Jiang W. Jones P. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5824-5828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Brandi A. Pietroni P. Gualerzı́ C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our data show that the increase in the CspC concentration following a decrease in temperature is at least partly mediated by enhanced protein stability, revealing that CSP induction can also be achieved at the level of protein stability. The conformational stability of CspC is considerably lower than that of CspB and CspD and may account for efficient degradation of CspC at 37 °C. Following cold shock, the half-life of CspC may be prolonged by a reduction of the proteolytic activity in the cell and/or a higher conformational stability of CspC at low temperatures.The CSPs are probably stabilized in vivo by the cooperative binding to their mRNA substrates (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Indeed, CspB and CspD were strongly stabilized against proteolysis in vitro by a single-stranded 54-mer DNA ligand. It is remarkable that the rates of proteolysis of CspB and CspD decreased more than 10-fold when the concentration of the DNA ligand was only half the CSP concentration. This finding suggests that several CSP molecules bind with strong positive cooperativity to a single-stranded DNA molecule and thus become protected against proteolytic cleavage. This binding by CSPs destabilizes double-stranded regions of RNA and thus increases their susceptibility to hydrolysis (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that even in the absence of a cold shock, CSPs are permanently complexed with nucleic acids, most likely with mRNA. On the other hand, the cellular concentration of CSPs can be efficiently controlled by the degradation of excess CSPs that are not bound to mRNA. A tight regulation of CSP levels appears to be important in bacteria, because heterologous induction of CspB in E. coli profoundly alters the pattern of protein synthesis and leads to a marked decrease in growth rate (33Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cold shock proteins (CSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: CSP, cold shock protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CD, circular dichroism; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: CSP, cold shock protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CD, circular dichroism; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. are found in a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, often in families of three (as in Bacillus subtilis) to nine (as inEscherichia coli) highly homologous members (identity >70%) (for review see Ref. 1Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Recently, CSPs were also found inAquifex aeolicus (2Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) and Thermotoga maritima (3Perl D. Welker C. Schindler T. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Jaenicke R. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), indicating that CSPs were present at the origin of bacterial divergence and therefore are presumably an evolutionarily old class of proteins. A CSP-homologous domain (cold shock domain) is found in many eukaryotic nucleic acid-binding proteins (for review see Ref. 4Sommerville J. Ladomery M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), where it confers specific RNA binding (5Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Matsumoto K. Meric F. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CSPs bind to single-stranded DNA and RNA in a cooperative manner and with low sequence specificity (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol.

As a model for the cold shock domain, the structures of CspB (B. subtilis) and CspA (E. coli) were solved, revealing similar, compact five-stranded β-barrel folds (10Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 12Schindelin H. Jiang W. Inouye M. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5119-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 13Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CSPs possess binding sites for single-stranded nucleic acids on their antiparallel three-stranded β-sheets, which involve basic and aromatic residues. These are the so-called RNA-binding ribonucleoprotein motifs (13Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,14Schröder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). CSPs were discovered originally because they are strongly induced in response to cold shock (15Jones P.G. Van Bogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and thus they were assumed to be important for adaptation to low temperatures. The major cold shock protein, CspA from E. coli, was in fact shown to increase the synthesis of several cold stress-inducible proteins after a decrease in temperature (16Jones P.G. Krah R. Tafuri S. Wolffe A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5798-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, different members of the E. coli CSP family are regulated differently and appear to perform functions also during cell division or during the stationary phase (17Yamanaka K. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Recent work shows that in B. subtilis, CSPs are essential for protein synthesis at low as well as at optimal temperature and also during the stationary phase (8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, CspA from E. colidestabilizes secondary and tertiary structures in RNA in vitro (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), which led to the assumption that CSPs facilitate initiation of translation as “RNA chaperones” by preventing the formation of stable, nonproductive secondary structures in mRNA under various conditions. Induction of CSPs after cold shock originates from an increase in transcription of their genes (18Jiang W. Jones P. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5824-5828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, to a greater extent, from the stabilization of their mRNAs (19Brandi A. Pietroni P. Gualerzı́ C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, thecspA-mRNA seems to be translated more efficiently than the mRNAs coding for proteins that are not induced by cold stress (21Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Whether the concentration of CSPs is also regulated on the level of protein stability is not yet known. CspB from B. subtilisexhibits a very low conformational stability, and its native form exists in an extremely dynamic equilibrium with the unfolded form. The average lifetime of the folded conformation is only about 100 ms under physiological conditions. Therefore, we proposed that CspB might be subject to rapid degradation in vivo (22Schindler T. Herrler M. Marahiel M.A. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The three members of the CSP family from B. subtilis show sequence identities of 72–80% (Table I) and can complement each otherin vivo (8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). CspB is important both at low and at optimal temperatures. CspC functions mainly at low temperature and CspD mainly at optimal temperature. CspB is the reference molecule for this sequence alignment. Colons mark identical positions and points mark conservative exchanges. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) motifs are in bold. Here we investigated the stability and the folding kinetics of CspC and CspD of B. subtilis. These two cold shock proteins resemble CspB in their rapid unfolding and refolding and in their low thermodynamic stability. Marginal stability linked with high conformational dynamics might be an effective means for regulating the cellular concentration of CSPs. To explore this possibility, we investigated the proteolytic stabilities of CspB, CspC, and CspDin vitro. The proteolytic susceptibility of all three proteins is in fact high but decreases strongly in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of single-stranded nucleic acids. In vivo, CspB and CspD, but not CspC, were stable at 37 and at 15 °C. CspC was significantly stabilized after a cold shock. These findings suggest that CSPs are complexed with a nucleic acid ligand in the cell, under cold shock conditions as well as at 37 °C, and are thereby protected against proteolytic attack. DISCUSSIONThe CSPs of B. subtilis (CspB, CspC, CspD, sequence identity 71–78%) share a common three-dimensional structure (10Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 12Schindelin H. Jiang W. Inouye M. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5119-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 13Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CspB folds extremely rapidly and reversibly without any intermediate steps and has a very low kinetic barrier to unfolding (22Schindler T. Herrler M. Marahiel M.A. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Similarly rapid two-state unfolding and refolding kinetics were found also for CspC and CspD in this work. These properties are likely to be general features of CSPs, because recently they were also found for CSPs from other mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic bacteria (3Perl D. Welker C. Schindler T. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Jaenicke R. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar,31Reid K.L. Rodriguez H.M. Hillier B.J. Gregoret L.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).CspB and CspD of B. subtilis show virtually identical low thermodynamic stabilities of −10 to −11 kJ/mol, and the stability of CspC is further reduced to only −6 kJ/mol. As a result, 8% of CspC molecules are expected to be denatured even under native conditions, compared with 1% for CspB. Interestingly, in CspC, Pro-58 of CspB and CspD is replaced by alanine (Table I). This substitution probably contributes to the reduced conformational stability of CspC because Pro residues reduce the entropy of the unfolded protein. All three CSPs feature a highly dynamic native conformation. CspB and CspD show almost identical rates of unfolding (12 s−1) and refolding (1000 s−1). Refolding of CspC is decelerated 8-fold, which reflects its lowered stability, but it also unfolds at a rate of 12 s−1 under native conditions.Consistent with their low thermodynamic stability and high frequency of unfolding, we found that all three CSPs of B. subtilis are excellent substrates for proteases in vitro. Their susceptibilities parallel the rank order of conformational stability; CspD is slightly more resistant to proteolytic degradation than CspB, whereas CspC with its particularly low thermodynamic stability is degraded most rapidly.The pulse-chase experiments in Fig. 7 show that, despite this rapid proteolysis of the purified proteins in vitro, CspB and CspD are not detectably degraded during logarithmic growth of B. subtilis at 37 °C. This result is in agreement with the finding that the CSPs have an essential function at optimal temperature (8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). CspC is degraded at 37 °C with a half-life of about 75 min. CspB and CspD are readily detectable in Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE from cells grown at 37 °C, whereas CspC is only faintly visible by Western blotting at this temperature (data not shown). After cold shock, all three CSPs were stable for at least 36 h (>1 doubling time). Thus, in the absence of a detectable turnover, enhanced synthesis following cold shock (29Graumann P. Schröder K. Schmid R. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4611-4619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) leads to an increase in the intracellular concentrations of CSPs. The different in vivo CSP stabilities agree with earlier findings that the function of CspC is more important at low temperatures, whereas CspB performs its function, which is not transient, at optimal growth temperature as well as under cold shock conditions (8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).CspA of E. coli has also been reported to be stable after cold shock at 10 °C. For its stability at 37 °C, contradictory results have been obtained. Pulse labeling of cold-shocked cells followed by a chase at low temperature and subsequent shift to optimal growth temperature was reported to produce CspA that could still be detected after several hours at 37 °C (32Goldstein J. Pollitt S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). On the other hand, induction of cspA from a heterologous promoter and pulse-chase of CspA at 37 °C resulted in protein with a rather short half-life (7 min under the experimental conditions employed) (19Brandi A. Pietroni P. Gualerzı́ C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Induction of CSPs by cold shock originates from increased transcription of csp genes and from stabilization of cspmRNAs (18Jiang W. Jones P. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5824-5828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Brandi A. Pietroni P. Gualerzı́ C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our data show that the increase in the CspC concentration following a decrease in temperature is at least partly mediated by enhanced protein stability, revealing that CSP induction can also be achieved at the level of protein stability. The conformational stability of CspC is considerably lower than that of CspB and CspD and may account for efficient degradation of CspC at 37 °C. Following cold shock, the half-life of CspC may be prolonged by a reduction of the proteolytic activity in the cell and/or a higher conformational stability of CspC at low temperatures.The CSPs are probably stabilized in vivo by the cooperative binding to their mRNA substrates (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Indeed, CspB and CspD were strongly stabilized against proteolysis in vitro by a single-stranded 54-mer DNA ligand. It is remarkable that the rates of proteolysis of CspB and CspD decreased more than 10-fold when the concentration of the DNA ligand was only half the CSP concentration. This finding suggests that several CSP molecules bind with strong positive cooperativity to a single-stranded DNA molecule and thus become protected against proteolytic cleavage. This binding by CSPs destabilizes double-stranded regions of RNA and thus increases their susceptibility to hydrolysis (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that even in the absence of a cold shock, CSPs are permanently complexed with nucleic acids, most likely with mRNA. On the other hand, the cellular concentration of CSPs can be efficiently controlled by the degradation of excess CSPs that are not bound to mRNA. A tight regulation of CSP levels appears to be important in bacteria, because heterologous induction of CspB in E. coli profoundly alters the pattern of protein synthesis and leads to a marked decrease in growth rate (33Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The CSPs of B. subtilis (CspB, CspC, CspD, sequence identity 71–78%) share a common three-dimensional structure (10Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Graumann P.

On the other hand, induction of cspA from a heterologous promoter and pulse-chase of CspA at 37 °C resulted in protein with a rather short half-life (7 min under the experimental conditions employed) (19Brandi A. Pietroni P. Gualerzı́ C.O. Pon C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Induction of CSPs by cold shock originates from increased transcription of csp genes and from stabilization of cspmRNAs (18Jiang W. Jones P. Inouye M. J.

The conformational stability of CspC is considerably lower than that of CspB and CspD and may account for efficient degradation of CspC at 37 °C. Following cold shock, the half-life of CspC may be prolonged by a reduction of the proteolytic activity in the cell and/or a higher conformational stability of CspC at low temperatures. The CSPs are probably stabilized in vivo by the cooperative binding to their mRNA substrates (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 8Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Indeed, CspB and CspD were strongly stabilized against proteolysis in vitro by a single-stranded 54-mer DNA ligand. It is remarkable that the rates of proteolysis of CspB and CspD decreased more than 10-fold when the concentration of the DNA ligand was only half the CSP concentration. This finding suggests that several CSP molecules bind with strong positive cooperativity to a single-stranded DNA molecule and thus become protected against proteolytic cleavage. This binding by CSPs destabilizes double-stranded regions of RNA and thus increases their susceptibility to hydrolysis (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that even in the absence of a cold shock, CSPs are permanently complexed with nucleic acids, most likely with mRNA. On the other hand, the cellular concentration of CSPs can be efficiently controlled by the degradation of excess CSPs that are not bound to mRNA. A tight regulation of CSP levels appears to be important in bacteria, because heterologous induction of CspB in E. coli profoundly alters the pattern of protein synthesis and leads to a marked decrease in growth rate (33Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

We have previously shown that two transcriptional regulators, RcsA and RcsB, do bind as a heterodimer to the promoter of amsG, the first reading frame in the operon for amylovoran biosynthesis in the plant pathogenic bacterium Erwinia amylovora. We now identified a 23-base pair fragment from position −555 to −533 upstream of the translational start site of amsG as sufficient for the specific binding of the Rcs proteins.

General benefits of encapsulation are the prevention of desiccation, advantages in the degradation of substrates by adherence, and the binding of toxins and nutrients (1Beveridge T.J. Graham L.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 684-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EPS is furthermore an essential determinant for the bacterial virulence in several host-pathogen interactions (2Leigh J.A. Coplin D.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 307-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), e.g. during infections by the plant pathogenic bacteria Erwinia amylovora and Pantoea stewartii subsp.stewartii (Ref. 3Mergaert J. Verdonck L. Kersters K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 162-173Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar; formerly Erwinia stewartii). The dense layer of EPS is supposed to shield invading microorganisms against host defense systems like the hypersensitive response reaction. It might further prevent cell aggregation by agglutinins, and it has been reported to accelerate the wilting of infected plants by plugging xylem vessels (4Hsu S.T. Goodman R.N. Phytopathology. 1978; 68: 351-354Crossref Google Scholar). The EPS structure is highly variable, and different types have been classified by molecular weight and structural properties (5Jayaratne P. Keenleyside W.J. MacLachlan P.R. Dodgson C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5384-5394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of the high molecular weight EPS type IA in several enterobacterial species is modulated by the Rcs (regulation of capsule synthesis) regulatory network (6Gottesman S. Hoch J.A.

Genet. 1991; 229: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) by Rcs proteins has been reported. EPS biosynthesis is supposed to be induced after perception of external signals by membrane-located sensors like the RcsC protein. The signal might be subsequently transduced by phosphorylation of the response regulator RcsB, and the two proteins represent a typical bacterial two-component system (18Stout V. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High levels of EPS biosynthesis require the coinduction by the unstable protein RcsA (7Stout V. Torres-Cabassa A. Maurizi M.R. Gutnick D. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Trisler P. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 184-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Torres-Cabassa A.S.

RcsA and RcsB are grouped into the LuxR class of bacterial regulators based on the sequence of their C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding motifs. The structural genes for the biosynthesis of amylovoran in E. amylovora, stewartan in P. stewartii, and colanic acid in E. coli are clustered and regulated as operons (21Bugert P. Geider K. Mol.

L. Coplin, unpublished observations. The essential regulatory region upstream of the first open reading frame of theams operon covers an unusually large region of about 700 bp (21Bugert P. Geider K. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 917-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The transcriptional start site of the homologous cpsoperon of E. coli was mapped at 340 bp upstream of the translational start site (23Stout V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional units of EPS operons may therefore contain large leader regions of yet unknown function. We recently reported the binding of RcsA and RcsB proteins from E. amylovora and E. coli to a putative promoter region located between −578 and −501 relative to the translational start site of amsG, the first reading frame in the amsoperon (24Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We could demonstrate the binding of RcsA and RcsB as a heterodimer and that RcsB, but not RcsA, is able to bind alone at higher concentrations. In this report, we could confine the essential Rcs-binding region, and we present the recognition motif for the RcsA/RcsB dimer at theamsG promoter of E. amylovora. We could furthermore identify an RcsA/RcsB-binding site at the corresponding location in the P. stewartii cpsA promoter. Our results give evidence that the binding of RcsA/RcsB to promoters in EPS operons could be a common principle for triggering the capsule synthesis in the Rcs regulatory pathway.

Sequencing grade plasmid DNA was isolated from strain XL1-Blue. DNA sequencing was done by the chain termination technique (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The P. stewartii rcsA gene was amplified from chromosomal DNA of theP. stewartii wild type strain DC283 by using the following primers: RcsAPS forward, GGGGATCCATGCCAACGATTATTATGGATTCC; RcsAPS reverse, GGAAGCTTCTATCTTACGTTCACGTAAATACCAG. The plasmid pM-RcsAES was constructed by cloning the rcsAgene into the BamHI/HindIII site of the expression vector pMalc2. The fragment F183 with the Rcs-binding site of the amsG promoter was amplified from plasmid pEA131 by PCR as described (24Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GenBankTMaccession number for the P. stewartii cpsA promoter isAF077292. The bacteria were grown in a 10-liter fermenter at 28 °C with 90% O2saturation and at pH 7.0. LB broth was subcultured (1:200) into fresh medium from an overnight culture, and 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added when theA 590 reached 0.5. The cells were incubated for additional 3 h, pelleted by centrifugation, and stored at −25 °C. The RcsA proteins were expressed from plasmids pM-RcsAEA and pM-RcsAES in strain JB3034 as a C-terminal fusion to the maltose-binding protein. The RcsB proteins were expressed from plasmids pM-RcsBEA with an N-terminal fusion to the maltose-binding protein and pQ-RcsBEA with an N-terminal poly(His)6-tag in the strain BL21. The Rcs proteins were purified in a two-step procedure by affinity chromatography using purified starch or metal chelate resin, followed by anionic exchange chromatography as described (24Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If applicable, the purified proteins were further designated as M-Rcs proteins when fused with the maltose-binding protein and as H-Rcs proteins when fused with a poly(His)6-tag. DNA labeling with [α-32P]dATP, DNA binding assays, and separation of protein-DNA complexes from unbound DNA by native PAGE were performed as described (24Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Retardation of DNA fragments by Rcs proteins was monitored by gel electrophoresis and exposure of the dried gels to x-ray films. For quantitative assays, the developed x-ray films were aligned with the corresponding dried gel, the bands of retarded and free DNA were cut out, and the amount of labeled DNA in the gel slices was quantified in a scintillation counter. The 23-bp fragment F23, representing the minimal RcsA/RcsB binding region, was fused to a restriction linker and to an approximately 0.2-kilobase pair DNA fragment from the vector pBluescript by PCR to facilitate the selection procedure. The complete sequence of the fragment F23 was then permutated by generating six DNA pools in which three or four bases of the wild type sequence were replaced by randomized bases. The DNA pools were synthesized by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: S-A, GCAAGCTTAAATTAAGATTATTCTCAANNNNACGGCCAGTGAGCGCGCGTAATACG; S-B, GCAAGCTTAAATTAAGATTATTCNNNNTATAACGGCCAGTGAGCGCGCGTAATACG; S-C, GCAAGCTTAAATTAAGATTANNNTCAATATAACGGCCAGTGAGCGCGCGTAATACG; with SABC-rev, GCAAGCTTAAATTAAGATTA; and S-D, CGCTGCAGCGGTATATTGAGAANNNNCTTAATTTGGCGAGTTACATGATCCCCCATGTTG; S-E, CGCTGCAGCGGTATATTGAGAATAATNNNNATTTGGCGAGTTACATGATCCCCCATGTTG; S-F, CGCTGCAGCGGTATATTGAGAATAATCTTANNNNGGCGAGTTACATGATCCCCCATGTTG; with SDEF-rev, CGGGATCCCACTATTCTCAGAATGACTTGGTTG as primers, and with pBluescript KS+ as a template. The primers S-A until S-F contained the fragment F23 with the randomly substituted positions and a suitable restriction site as a linker. The primers annealed to a specific region of pBluescript KS+ and generated with the reverse primers SABC-rev and SDEF-rev DNA fragments of about 0.2 kilobase pairs. The amplified DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and about 1 μg of each DNA pool was used as target DNA in an EMSA with 1.89 μm RcsA and 0.17 μm RcsB at optimized conditions. The native polyacrylamide gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and the shifted DNA bands were cut out. The DNA was eluted from the gel slices by shaking overnight in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 0.5m sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, at 37 °C, and the selected fragments were reamplified by PCR using the primers SABC-rev with SABC-for, CCGAATTCCTGCAGCCCGGG, and SDEF-rev with SDEF-for, CGCTGCAGCGGTATATTGAGAA. The selection was repeated twice, and the DNA fragments were finally cloned into pBluescript KS+ and sequenced. Reactions were set up as described for the EMSA (24Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After 20 min at 28 °C, the solution was irradiated 5 cm from the ultraviolet light source for various times (as specified) with 312 nm. The reactions were cooled on ice during illumination. Oligonucleotides labeled with the photoreactive thymine analogue 5′-iododeoxyuracil were purchased from TIB-MolBiol/Berlin and reconstituted to double-stranded DNA. The proteins directly interacting with the template were photo-cross-linked to it and resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Cross-links were carried out in combination with competitor λ-DNA and bovine serum albumin. The binding region for the RcsA/RcsB heterodimer was located by making deletions from each terminus of the previously identified 183-bp fragment F183 and testing the retardation of each in EMSAs. The smallest retarded fragment was 23 bp (F23) (Fig. 1). Further deletions of 5 bp from either end of F23 either reduced or completely abolished the binding of the E. amylovoraRcsA/RcsB dimer (Fig. 1). The 23-bp Rcs binding region is localized from −555 to −533 upstream of the translational start site ofamsG, the first reading frame of the ams operon (Fig. 2). The identified Rcs-binding site overlapped with the previously proposed promoter region of theams operon and included the putative −35 region.Figure 2Localization of the RcsA/RcsB-binding site in the promoters of amsG from E. amylovora andcpsA from P. stewartii.Regions from about −200 bp to about −600 bp upstream of the start codons ofamsG and cpsA were aligned.

Sets of two or three nucleotides were mutated by nucleotide transitions, and the binding of RcsA/RcsB to the fragments was quantified in EMSAs (Fig.3). Most important for the recognition by RcsA/RcsB was the region from nucleotide positions 4–14. The A-C and T-G transitions at position 4 and 6 of fragment M4/6resulted in a decrease of retardation to about 18% compared with the wild type sequence. The nucleotide substitutions of positions 7–14 in the fragments M7–9, M9–11, and M12–14 completely abolished a DNA shift by RcsA/RcsB. The terminal mutations at nucleotide positions 18/20 and 21/23 were tolerated by the Rcs proteins, and no or only minor decreases in the DNA retardation were detected. These results gave evidence that a specific recognition by the RcsA/RcsB dimer might be determined by the central region of fragment F23, whereas the obvious essential contacts to nucleotides at positions 18–23 might not be sequence-specific and could occur with the phosphate backbone. The protein-DNA interaction of RcsA/RcsB with nucleotides of the central region of fragment F23 was verified by UV cross-linking. The thymine bases at nucleotide positions 8, 10, 11, and 13 were substituted by 5′-iododeoxyuracil and the modified fragment F23 was incubated with RcsA/RcsB proteins at optimal DNA-binding conditions. The formation of cross-linked protein-DNA complexes was analyzed by SDS-PAGE after illumination of the DNA binding assay for 30 min at 312 nm (Fig.4). A cross-linked band was clearly visible and demonstrated the close contact of the Rcs proteins with at least some of the labeled thymines. We estimated the affinity of the RcsA/RcsB heterodimer for fragment F183with increasing concentrations of an equimolar solution of RcsA and RcsB. With this approach, the apparent binding constant of the RcsA/RcsB heterodimer was calculated at about 100 nm. The same result was obtained by using a constant amount of 30 nm RcsB or 2.5 μm RcsB with increasing amounts of RcsA starting from 19 nm up to 1.5 μm. The usage of different protein ratios did not change the DNA binding kinetics as the binding constant of a heterodimer to DNA should depend only on an equilibrium between the putative free RcsA/RcsB dimer and an RcsA-RcsB-DNA complex. The increase of one protein component will therefore affect the equilibrium between protein dimer and monomers in favor of the RcsA/RcsB heterodimer formation. However, the protein dimer might be rather unstable as we have not been able to detect any RcsA/RcsB dimer formation neither in the yeast two-hybrid system nor by affinity chromatography of RcsA with the immobilized poly(His)6-tagged RcsB (data not shown). Relatively high protein concentrations of about 1.7 μmRcsA with 33 nm RcsB in the EMSA with fragment F183 of the amsG promoter resulted in an additional supershifted band (Fig. 5). We investigated whether this complex included additional copies of RcsB. The 24-kDa poly(His)6-tagged RcsB protein in the protein-DNA complex was subsequently replaced by increasing concentrations of the 68-kDa RcsB protein modified with an N-terminal fusion of the maltose-binding protein. The resulting band pattern shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates that the supershifted protein-DNA complex obviously contains two copies of the RcsB protein. The appearance of the supershift was dependent on the concentration of RcsA and at least one additional copy of RcsA might also be included in the complex. We could not prove this possibility, as the expression of unmodified or poly(His)6-tagged RcsA proteins results in the formation of inclusion bodies, and only the RcsA fusion to the maltose-binding protein was produced as soluble protein. Therefore it could not be completely ruled out that the supershifted complex does contain only one copy of RcsA together with two copies of RcsB. In that case, RcsB might be able to bind to the preexisting RcsA-RcsB heterodimer complex already formed with lower concentrations of RcsA. However, the lack of a supershifted band even at high concentrations of RcsA with smaller DNA targets like the fragments F28 or F23 of the amsG promoter make this assumption more unlikely. We propose that the supershifted complex represents an additional RcsA/RcsB heterodimer bound to a second less specific region in fragment F183. An important factor for the binding efficiency of the RcsA/RcsB dimer is the length of the offered target DNA. We determined the retardation of different DNA fragments containing the mapped Rcs recognition site at identical assay conditions in EMSAs by using 7.6 μmRcsA and 1.6 μm RcsB protein. Relatively high protein concentrations had to be used to obtain substantial amounts of retarded DNA even with the smallest fragment F23. The largest target was fragment F183, and the amount of retarded DNA was calculated at 52 ± 6%. The retardation of the smaller 28- and 23-bp fragments F28 and F23 were clearly decreased to 14.2 ± 8.8 and 10.1 ± 5.4%, respectively. The results demonstrate that additional and nonspecific nucleotides might stabilize the protein-DNA interactions. Once formed, the stability of the RcsA-RcsB-DNA complex might be one major determinant for the induction of ams expression. We determined the half-life of the complex in a competition experiment with the labeled fragment F183 as a target and about 30 nm RcsB and 550 nm RcsA, respectively. These conditions were found to be ideal for the retardation of fragment F183. The binding assays were first incubated at standard conditions for 10 min to receive an equilibrium between free ligands and the RcsA-RcsB-DNA complex. The assays were then supplemented at varying time intervals starting from 2 s to 1 h with about 30-fold excess of unlabeled fragment F183. Finally, all samples were analyzed by native PAGE, and the amounts of protein-DNA complex and unbound DNA were quantified. The results were plotted, and the half-life of the RcsA-RcsB-F183 complex could be calculated at about 42 s. The Rcs-DNA complex can be considered to be of only low stability if compared with known half-lives of transcriptional repressors to their target DNAs. However, this result is expected for a transcriptional inducer, as the EPS biosynthesis is controlled by environmental signals and the relative low stability of the inductive Rcs-DNA complex might be essential for a fast response to changing conditions. The sequence of the identified Rcs binding region in theamsG promoter shows some palindrome elements, which could be important for the recognition by the proteins. However, the binding of a protein heterodimer does not require a palindromic binding motif. To identify nucleotide positions, which are responsible for the specificity of the RcsA/RcsB binding, we analyzed the sequence of fragment F23 by an in vitro selection approach. The sequence of fragment F23 was permutated by substitution of 3- or 4-bp-long stretches of nucleotides by randomized nucleotides. The resulting six probes contained random positions in different regions throughout the fragment F23 and represented a pool of 64 and 256 DNA fragments, respectively. Each mixture was used as target DNA in EMSAs with 1.89 μm RcsA and 0.17 μm RcsB protein as described under “Materials and Methods.” The higher protein concentrations had to be used to obtain sufficient retarded DNA for the visualization by ethidium bromide staining. The retarded DNA fragments were isolated, and the selection was repeated twice. The retarded DNA fraction after the third selection by the RcsA/RcsB proteins was quantified and compared with the retardation efficiencies of the unselected DNA mixtures (TableII). The retardation of each DNA mixture was enhanced after the selection for at least 200%. The sequence of the nucleotide positions 9–11 of fragment F23 was most important for the binding of the RcsA/RcsB proteins as almost no retardation of the corresponding unselected DNA mixture was notable. This result corresponds to our previous findings in the mutation analysis and is also in agreement with the observed UV cross-link of the Rcs proteins to that DNA region. The sequence of the terminal nucleotide positions of fragment F23 seems to be of minor importance for a specific binding of RcsA/RcsB, as already the unselected pools showed a considerable retardation in the EMSA.Table IIIn vitro selection of DNA fragments with random substitutionsSelected regionaOnly the sequence of the upper strand of fragment F23 is shown; random positions are in bold.RetardationbRetarded DNA was analyzed by EMSA as described under “Materials and Methods” with 1.89 μm RcsA and 0.17 μm RcsB.

https://openalex.org/W1985956700,"The reaction of purified bovine mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and hydrogen peroxide was studied using the ESR spin-trapping technique. A protein-centered radical adduct was trapped by 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide and was assigned to a thiyl radical adduct based on its hyperfine coupling constants of aN = 14.7 G and abetaH = 15.7 G. The ESR spectra obtained using the nitroso spin traps 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid (DBNBS) and 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP) indicated that both DBNBS/.CcO and MNP/.CcO radical adducts are immobilized nitroxides formed by the trapping of protein-derived radicals. Alkylation of the free thiols on the enzyme with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) prevented 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide adduct formation and changed the spectra of the MNP and DBNBS radical adducts. Nonspecific protease treatment of MNP-d9/.NEM-CcO converted its spectrum from that of an immobilized nitroxide to an isotropic three-line spectrum characteristic of rapid molecular motion. Super-hyperfine couplings were detected in this spectrum and assigned to the MNP/.tyrosyl adduct(s). The inhibition of either CcO or NEM-CcO with potassium cyanide prevented detectable MNP adduct formation, indicating heme involvement in the reaction. The results indicate that one or more cysteine residues are the preferred reductant of the presumed ferryl porphyrin cation radical residue intermediate. When the cysteine residues are blocked with NEM, one or more tyrosine residues become the preferred reductant, forming the tyrosyl radical."

https://openalex.org/W2051178710,"The in vitro phosphorylation of transcription factors by growth factor-activated protein kinases has resulted in the discovery of a number of activities whose identities and relationships to one another are unclear. Fos kinase is a growth factor-stimulated serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates c-Fos at serine 362 within the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain. Fos kinase activation is dependent on p21ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase (MEK) activity and is independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. We have purified Fos kinase by affinity chromatography using the Sepharose-linked protein kinase inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM). Fos kinase has an apparent molecular mass of 88 kDa, and mass spectrophotometric analysis of the isolated protein showed that it produced tryptic fragments identical to those predicted for pp90rsk2. Fos kinase isolated from nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells is indistinguishable from NGFI-B kinase I, based on their chromatographic behavior, substrate specificities, and relative sensitivity to BIM. Furthermore, we have distinguished Fos kinase from calcium/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) kinase. Therefore, Fos kinase and NGFI-B kinase I and pp90rsk2 represent the same protein kinase species. Moreover, we report that pp90rsk2 exists within nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells as two chromatographically and immunologically distinct species. Finally, we demonstrate that CREB kinase is distinct from pp90rsk2.

Finally, we demonstrate that CREB kinase is distinct from pp90rsk2. Cells respond to various extracellular stimuli including growth factors, hormones, and changes in environmental conditions through the activation of intracellular signal transduction networks. Investigations of such signaling pathways have largely focused on the identification of constituents of these pathways with the aim of modeling functional cascades that lead from activated receptors to specific cytoplasmic and nuclear effectors (1Denhardt D. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 2Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The activity of many enzymes that comprise these cascades is regulated by their phosphorylation state. Thus, protein kinases and phosphatases play central roles in the sequential transfer of information through such cascades. We previously identified a growth factor-inducible serine/threonine protein kinase, termed Fos kinase, whose activity is rapidly induced after growth factor stimulation (3Taylor L.K. Marshak D.R. Landreth G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fos kinase was identified and so named by its in vitro ability to phosphorylate serine 362 of the proto-oncogene product, c-Fos, as well as a synthetic peptide whose sequence consists of 12 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the c-Fos protein (4Taylor L. Swanson K. Kerigan J. Mobley W. Landreth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 308-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blenis and colleagues (5Chen R. Abate C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10952-10956Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) demonstrated that serines 362 and 374 were in vitrosubstrates for pp90rsk1 and ERK, 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular regulated kinase; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; CRE, calcium/cAMP response element; CREB, calcium/cAMP response element-binding protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase; NGF, nerve growth factor; rsk, ribosomal S6 kinase; PSD, post-source decay; PKC, protein kinase C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular regulated kinase; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; CRE, calcium/cAMP response element; CREB, calcium/cAMP response element-binding protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase; NGF, nerve growth factor; rsk, ribosomal S6 kinase; PSD, post-source decay; PKC, protein kinase C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. respectively. Mutation of these serines to glutamate residues resulted in the increased ability to transform NIH 3T3 cells that was correlated with increased protein half-life, suggesting that phosphorylation at these sites within c-Fos promoted its stability and thus elevated AP-1 levels (6Chen R. Juo P. Curran T. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1493-1502PubMed Google Scholar,7Curran T. Miller A. Zokas L. Verma I. Cell. 1984; 36: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These data suggested that Fos kinase activity may be involved in promoting growth factor-induced changes in transcription (4Taylor L. Swanson K. Kerigan J. Mobley W. Landreth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 308-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinases are typically identified through their ability to phosphorylate recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides in vitro. This convention results in the confusion of different enzymes due to their relaxed substrate specificity arising from promiscuous phosphorylation of substrates. One goal of the present study was to establish the identities and relationships of protein kinases that phosphorylate similar sites within the transcription factors c-Fos, CREB, and NGFI-B. NGFI-B kinase I was identified in PC12 cells as a growth factor-stimulated protein kinase able to phosphorylate the orphan steroid receptor NGFI-B (nur77), an immediate early gene product (8Hirata Y. Whalin M. Ginty D. Xing J. Greenberg M. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Hirata Y. Kiuchi K. Chen H. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24808-24812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of NGFI-B at serine 350 results in the loss of its DNA-binding ability. NGFI-B is expressed following both depolarization and growth factor stimulation. However, NGFI-B is only phosphorylated by NGFI-B kinase I only in response to growth factor stimulation, reflecting the complexity of the NGFI-B regulation. When NGFI-B is expressed as a result of growth factor stimulation, it was predominantly found in the cytoplasm, whereas when its expression was driven by membrane depolarization it was located within both the nucleus and cytoplasm (10Katagiri Y. Hirata Y. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31278-31284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This suggests a role for NGFI-B kinase I in controlling the cellular distribution of this protein as well as governing its ability to bind its DNA element. NGFI-B kinase I shares many characteristics with Fos kinase including similar behavior on chromatographic resins, substrate recognition sequences, and activation kinetics downstream of growth factor stimulation (4Taylor L. Swanson K. Kerigan J. Mobley W. Landreth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 308-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hirata Y. Whalin M. Ginty D. Xing J. Greenberg M. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and prompted us to compare directly these protein kinases to determine their relationship to each other. The transcription factor, calcium/cAMP responseelement binding protein (CREB), is constitutively bound to the calcium responseelement (CRE). Phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 confers its ability to activate transcription from the CRE (11Bonni A. Ginty D. Dudek H. Greenberg M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This site has been shown to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A, PKC, and calmodulin kinase II and MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (12Xing J. Kornhauser J. Xia Z. Thiele E. Greenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinases that function within signal transduction pathways mediate the action of a variety of different stimuli. Another enzyme capable of phosphorylating this site, CREB kinase, was described by Xing et al. (13Xing J. Ginty D. Greenberg M. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) and subsequently identified as a growth factor-stimulated member of the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase family, pp90rsk2. Like pp90rsk1, CREB kinase activation is dependent on p21ras (14Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) and functions as a downstream element of the MAP kinase cascade. p90rsk family members act to effect changes in gene expression through the phosphorylation and activation of nuclear transcription factors including CREB (13Xing J. Ginty D. Greenberg M. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) and c-Fos (6Chen R. Juo P. Curran T. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1493-1502PubMed Google Scholar). CREB kinase and NGFI-B kinase I exhibit similar biochemical features, including their behavior on Mono Q columns and substrate specificities, leading us to question whether Fos kinase, NGFI-B kinase I, and/or CREB kinase represented the same enzymatic species. We report that Fos kinase and NGFI-B kinase I represent a single protein kinase species that is indistinguishable from pp90rsk2. However, our findings demonstrate that CREB kinase and Fos kinase represent different species, casting doubt on the identity of CREB kinase as pp90rsk2 (13Xing J. Ginty D. Greenberg M. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). A primary finding of this study was that pp90rsk2 exists within PC12 cells in two chromatographically and immunologically distinct species. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY) in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C. PC12 cells expressing a dominant negative form of p21ras (GSRasDN6) cells (15Thomas S. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) were incubated with 2 mm dexamethasone for 24 h to induce expression of the transgene before stimulation with NGF and lysis. PC12 cells were harvested by gentle trituration from tissue culture plates, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml glucose and stimulated as indicated. The cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in TEV buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, and 100 μm orthovanadate) containing 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min, and the supernatants were applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated in TEV. The column was developed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and developed with a 40-ml 0–0.5 m NaCl linear gradient, and 1-ml fractions were collected. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211821) Google Scholar). Fos kinase activity was assayed by the phosphorylation of a peptide substrate encompassing the serine 362 phosphorylation site (RKGS*SSNEPSSD; 250 μm) in the presence of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (22 dpm/fmol), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Reactions were carried out in a final volume of 50 μl and terminated after 20 min at room temperature by the addition of 10 μg of bovine serum albumin and trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 3.5%. After 15 min at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged to remove precipitated proteins, and 25 μl of the resulting supernatants were spotted in triplicate onto P81 paper (Whatman) (17Glass D.B. Masaracchia J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The P81 papers were then washed 4 times for 5 min each in 75 mm phosphoric acid to remove unincorporated radioactivity. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting of the washed papers. Assays for kinase activities toward the CREB and NGFI-B protein substrates were conducted under similar conditions as described in the text using 1 μg of substrate protein per reaction. These reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The 32P-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Bisindolylmaleimide V (BIM) (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) was added to aliquots of Mono Q fractions containing Fos kinase to the final concentrations indicated in the text. 50-μl aliquots of Mono Q HR5/5 column fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinyldifluoropyrimidone membranes (NEN Life Science Products) at 0.9 A for 2 h in 15 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 100 mm glycine, and 9% methanol. The blots were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and probed with anti-pp90rsk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA), anti-pp90rsk2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid NY), or anti-pp90rsk3 (gift from Dr. David Mollar) antibodies at a 1:1000 or 1:500 dilution, respectively. The phospho-ERK-specific antibody was used at 1:20,000 (Promega, Madison, WI). Immunoreactivity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). CNBr-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Upsala, Sweden) was washed with HCl and activated by brief incubation with carbonate, pH 8. BIM was added to a final concentration of 20 nm with activated CNBr-Sepharose and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in the dark. The resin was then washed three times with approximately 100 volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and unreacted groups were quenched by incubation with 100 mmglycine for 30 min. The resin was then washed with approximately 100 volumes 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, of 1% Tween 20 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, five times for 15 min each to remove unreacted BIM. The resin was then blocked by incubation with ampholines (Pharmacia, Upsala Sweden) and washed once as described above. Fos kinase-containing samples were bound to BIM-Sepharose after first preclearing the samples with agarose beads by incubation in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm orthovanadate. The resin was then washed five times with this buffer and once with high pressure liquid chromatography grade water (Sigma). Bound proteins were eluted from the resin using SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were excised from the silver-stained gels. Minced gel pieces were washed with 25 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% acetonitrile, dried by speedvac, rehydrated in 25 mmNH4HCO3 solution containing trypsin, and digested overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted by washing with high pressure liquid chromatography grade water followed by three washes with 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature. The combined supernatants were dried down and redissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid prior to unseparated digests analysis. The peptide extracts were further desalted through a C18 column (0.3 mm inner diameter × 1 mm) (LC packing, San Francisco, CA). MALDI and PSD molecular masses of all tryptic peptides were determined by analyzing 1/10th of unseparated digest using a Voyager DE-STR Biospectrometry Workstation (Perspective Biosystems, Inc.) with a delayed extraction MALDI mass spectrometer and operated in the reflectron mode. Peptides were co-crystallized with equal volumes of matrices consisting of saturated solutions of α-cyano-4-hydrocinamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid. All MALDI spectra were internally calibrated by using trypsin autolysis products. Peptide masses were submitted for protein mass data base searching. The matched and unmatched masses were subjected to post-source decay (PSD) analysis on the same instrument to determine the peptide sequence and any possible sites of modification. The capillary high pressure liquid chromatography system (180 mm × 15 cm C18 column) was interfaced to a Mariner Biospectrometry workstation (Perspective Biosystems, Inc.) equipped with an electrospray source and orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass analyzer. The unseparated digests were directly injected onto C18 capillary column (180 mm × 15 cm). The tryptic peptide masses were also determined for peptide mapping. All the measured tryptic peptide masses measured either by MALDI-TOF or liquid chromatographic-electron spray were analyzed using MS-Fit program developed by K. Clauser and P. Baker. 2The MS-Fit and MS-Tag program can be found on web site http://prospector.ucsf.edu. To test the involvement of p21ras in NGF-stimulated Fos kinase activation, we used PC12 cells expressing a dominant negative form of p21ras (GSRasDN6 cells) under the control of the dexamethasone-sensitive murine mammary tumor virus promoter (15Thomas S. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). NGF treatment of these cells resulted in Fos kinase activation. However, following dexamethasone treatment, Fos kinase activation was refractory to NGF stimulation (Fig.1). Control studies demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment of wild-type PC12 cells did not affect Fos kinase activation (data not shown). The observation that the presence of a dominant negative form of p21ras within PC12 cells blocked Fos kinase activation demonstrates that Fos kinase lies downstream of p21ras in the NGF-induced signaling cascade. To test whether Fos kinase was a downstream effector of the Raf/MEK/ERK/MAP kinase pathway, we stimulated PC12 cells with NGF in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (18Alessi D. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D. Saltiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to PD98059 abolished Fos kinase activation (Fig.2), demonstrating that Fos kinase is a downstream element within the MAP kinase pathway. Fos kinase eluted in fraction 24 (180 mm NaCl). Fos kinase activation was resistant to both wortmannin and LY294002 treatment demonstrating that Fos kinase activation is not dependent on the activity of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (data not shown). Fos kinase activation is also resistant to inhibition by rapamycin further demonstrating that it is not involved in the pp70s6k pathway (3Taylor L.K. Marshak D.R. Landreth G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fos kinase was initially identified as an NGF-stimulated protein kinase activity capable of phosphorylating serine 362 of c-Fos (3Taylor L.K. Marshak D.R. Landreth G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Taylor L. Swanson K. Kerigan J. Mobley W. Landreth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 308-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We screened a panel of commercially available protein kinase inhibitors for their ability to inhibit Fos kinase activity in vitro. We tested these agents at twice the IC50 values for their identified enzyme targets. Fos kinase activity was resistant to the PKC inhibitors chelerythrine Cl− (19Herbert J. Augereau J. Gleye J. Maffrand J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and calphostin C (20Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), the CK II inhibitor 5,6-dicholor-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (21Zandomeni R. Zandomeni M. Shugar D. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the p70s6k inhibitor 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (22Grammer T. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23650-23652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). However, Rottlerin (23Gschwendt M. Muller H. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), BIM, and the structurally related drug, Gö6976, were found to potently inhibit Fos kinase, the latter two inhibitors exhibiting IC50 values for Fos kinase between 15 and 20 nm(see Fig. 9 B). Both BIM (24Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissins P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been held to be potent and selective inhibitors of PKC exhibiting an IC50 for these enzymes of between 15 and 20 nm. However, detailed analysis has revealed that BIM is equally effective in inhibiting the ribosomal S6 kinases, pp90rsk2 and pp70s6k (26Alessi D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), probably due to the homology between these enzymes and PKC within their ATP-binding subdomains. The possibility that Fos kinase was a classical or novel PKC isoform was ruled out by its activity in the presence of EGTA and the other PKC inhibitors described above. The sensitivity of Fos kinase to BIM and the dependence on MEK activity suggested the possibility that it might be an S6 kinase family member. Taylor et al. (4Taylor L. Swanson K. Kerigan J. Mobley W. Landreth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 308-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that Fos kinase was distinct from pp90rsk1 and pp70s6k. Comparison of the Mono Q elution profiles of Fos kinase activity with that of the identified members of this family, pp90rsk1, pp90rsk2, and pp90rsk3, revealed that Fos kinase activity eluted at 180 mm NaCl, whereas pp90rsk1eluted at 70 mm NaCl, pp90rsk2 eluted at 100 mm (Fig. 4), and pp90rsk3 eluted at 240 mm NaCl. Taken together, these data suggested that Fos kinase represented a novel S6 kinase or PKC family member.Figure 9Fos kinase and CREB kinase activities possess distinct elution profiles on Mono Q columns. PC12 cells were harvested after 16 h serum starvation and either stimulated with 50 ng/ml NGF (solid lines) for 5 min or left unstimulated (dashed lines). The cells were then lysed, and the lysates were fractionated by Mono Q chromatography. A, Fos kinase and CREBtide kinase activities were assayed by phosphorylation of either the Fos peptide (squares) or CREBtide (circle) substrates, respectively, and expressed as mean counts/min incorporated (±S.D. of triplicate determinations).B, CREB kinase within these fractions was detected by incorporation of 32P into CREB protein. Phosphorylated CREB was resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Fos kinase is distinct from pp90rsk2and pp90rsk3.

This finding raised the possibility that BIM could be used as an affinity ligand to facilitate purification of the enzyme. BIM was conjugated to CNBr-Sepharose to create an affinity resin. This resin was shown to deplete Fos kinase from peak Mono Q fractions. A BIM-insensitive Fos peptide kinase eluting at 70 mm NaCl (fraction 18) was used as a negative control to test the specific nature of Fos kinase binding to the BIM-Sepharose. CNBr-Sepharose conjugated to tryptophan was used as a control to demonstrate specificity because the structural backbone of both BIM and tryptophan consisted of indole groups (Fig. 5). Fos kinase is a phosphoprotein (3Taylor L.K. Marshak D.R. Landreth G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), allowing its binding to the BIM-Sepharose to be monitored by metabolic labeling of the protein with32Pi. PC12 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, harvested, and split into two pools; one pool of cells was stimulated with NGF for 5 min and the other cells remained unstimulated. Lysates from these cells were fractionated by Mono Q chromatography, and the resulting fractions were assayed for Fos kinase activity using the Fos peptide as a substrate. Aliquots of these fractions were incubated with BIM-Sepharose in parallel as described under “Methods and Materials.” Phosphoproteins that remained bound to the resin after washing were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography of the resulting gel revealed the presence of a 32P-labeled protein with a mass of 88 kDa that co-eluted from the Mono Q column with Fos kinase activity (Fig.6 A). Furthermore, this32P-labeled protein was detected in the NGF-stimulated cell lysates. In similar experiments using [35S]methionine-labeled protein, it was shown that this 88-kDa protein binds in both the stimulated and unstimulated samples demonstrating that it becomes phosphorylated upon NGF stimulation (Fig.6 B).Figure 6An 88-kDa protein co-fractionates with Fos kinase activity and binds to bisindolylmaleimide-Sepharose.

https://openalex.org/W2000199830,"Activation of certain phosphoinositidase C-linked cell surface receptors is known to cause an acceleration of the proteolysis of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors and, thus, lead to InsP3 receptor down-regulation. To gain insight into this process, we examined whether or not InsP3 receptor degradation is a direct consequence of InsP3 binding by analyzing the down-regulation of exogenous wild-type and binding-defective mutant InsP3receptors expressed in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Stimulation of these cells with carbachol showed that wild-type exogenous receptors could be down-regulated but that the binding-defective mutant exogenous receptors were not. Thus, InsP3 binding appears to mediate down-regulation. To validate this conclusion, a comprehensive analysis of the effects of the exogenous receptors was undertaken. This showed that exogenous receptors (i) are localized appropriately within the cell, (ii) enhance InsP3-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells, presumably by increasing the number of InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels, (iii) have minimal effects on Ca2+ mobilization and InsP3formation in intact cells, (iv) form heteromers with endogenous receptors, and (v) do not alter the down-regulation of endogenous receptors. In total, these data show that the introduction of exogenous receptors into SH-SY5Y cells does not compromise intracellular signaling or the down-regulatory process. We can thus conclude that InsP3 binding directly activates InsP3 receptor degradation. Because InsP3 binding induces a conformational change in the InsP3 receptor, these data suggest that this change provides the signal for accelerated proteolysis.

When certain types of G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors (for example, M3 muscarinic receptors) are occupied by their cognate agonists, phosphoinositidase C (PIC) 1The abbreviations used are: PIC, phosphoinositidase C; CCh, carbachol; HA, hemagglutinin; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3R, wild-type mouse type I InsP3 receptor; ΔInsP3R, InsP3 binding-defective mouse type I InsP3 receptor; InsP3RHA, HA epitope-tagged InsP3R; ΔInsP3RHA, HA epitope-tagged ΔInsP3R.1The abbreviations used are: PIC, phosphoinositidase C; CCh, carbachol; HA, hemagglutinin; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3R, wild-type mouse type I InsP3 receptor; ΔInsP3R, InsP3 binding-defective mouse type I InsP3 receptor; InsP3RHA, HA epitope-tagged InsP3R; ΔInsP3RHA, HA epitope-tagged ΔInsP3R. is activated, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is hydrolyzed and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol are formed (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). InsP3 is a second messenger that elicits calcium signals within cells that mediate many physiological processes (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). The primary effect of InsP3 is to trigger calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, thus raising cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). This is achieved by interaction of InsP3 with InsP3 receptors, proteins that form tetrameric complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and that act as calcium channels (3Joseph S.K. Cell.

Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), three domains have been defined: an InsP3-binding domain within the N-terminal 650 amino acids, a transmembrane or channel-forming domain close to the C terminus, and an intervening coupling domain (3Joseph S.K. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Yoshida Y. Imai S. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 74: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that a conformational change occurs upon InsP3binding and that this is responsible for channel opening (3Joseph S.K. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Yoshida Y. Imai S. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 74: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar).The waning of cellular responses during persistent activation of cell surface receptors is a well documented phenomenon (9Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and is evident for PIC-coupled receptors (10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Fisher S.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 231-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Such “desensitization” is mediated by several mechanisms, some of which occur acutely (within minutes), and some of which require long-term exposure to agonists (9Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol.

One of the mechanisms by which cells adapt during long-term agonist exposure is by down-regulation of cell surface receptors, which is characterized by a decline in the cellular content of these proteins (9Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol.

Remarkably, it has recently been found that InsP3receptors are also subject to down-regulation upon stimulation of PIC-linked cell surface receptors (12Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol.

It has also been shown that InsP3 receptor down-regulation can be induced by receptor-independent activation of PIC (17Honda Z. Takano T. Hirose N. Suzuki T. Muto A. Kume S. Mikoshiba K. Itoh K.

For example, stimulation of M3 muscarinic receptors in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with carbachol (CCh), a metabolically stable analogue of acetylcholine, reduces type I InsP3 receptor immunoreactivity by ∼90%, with half maximal effect at 0.5–1 h (13Wojcikiewicz R.J.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16652-16655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This reduction in InsP3 receptor content is a specific process, as the other proteins are not simultaneously down-regulated (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 15Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16652-16655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, the down-regulation is not related to changes in mRNA levels, but rather, it results from a profound acceleration of InsP3 receptor degradation (13Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The responsible proteolytic mechanism has yet to be defined but has been proposed to involve either calpain (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Oberdorf J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16652-16655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (15Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12454-12461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that InsP3 receptor down-regulation correlates with persistent increases in InsP3 concentration and is not mediated by a diacylglycerol-dependent pathway (12Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22234-22241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1992; 59: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As yet, however, it is not clear whether receptor proteolysis is initiated by InsP3 binding to its receptor, by Ca2+ signals generated following activation of InsP3 receptors or by a more indirect cell surface receptor-mediated mechanism (22Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Thus, to define whether or not InsP3 binding is the signal that initiates InsP3 receptor degradation, we established SH-SY5Y cell lines stably expressing wild-type and mutant type I InsP3 receptors and focused on the characteristics of a binding-defective mutant. We found that this mutant InsP3receptor was resistant to down-regulation, whereas wild-type InsP3 receptor was appropriately down-regulated. Thus, our data indicate that InsP3 binding directly activates InsP3 receptor down-regulation.DISCUSSIONThe data presented show (i) that deletion of 37 amino acids within the ligand-binding domain of the type I InsP3 receptor renders it unable to bind InsP3 and blocks its down-regulation, (ii) that introduction of exogenous InsP3receptors into SH-SY5Y cells does not adversely affect signaling via PIC-linked receptors, and (iii) that exogenous receptors are appropriately located within the cell and form heteromers and functional Ca2+ channels with endogenous receptors. Thus, we conclude that InsP3 binding directly activates InsP3 receptor degradation.Importantly, our studies on the effects of exogenous InsP3receptors on signaling in intact SH-SY5Y cells are the first in a mammalian cell type in which both the complement of endogenous InsP3 receptors is known (SH-SY5Y cells contain >99% type I receptor (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar)), and an appreciable overexpression of InsP3 receptor has been achieved. To date, the effects of exogenous InsP3 receptors on intracellular signaling have been examined in only three other mammalian cell types (33Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1990; 5: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 34Mackrill J.J. Wilcox R.A. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27167-27170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the most comprehensive of these analyses being performed on 3T3 fibroblasts (37Fischer G.A. Clementi E. Raichman M. Sudhof T. Ullrich A. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19216-19224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in that study, only very limited overexpression of exogenous type I receptor was achieved (15–30% above endogenous values) and possible interaction with endogenous type II and III receptors, which make up ∼90% of the total receptor complement in this cell type (39De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Henning R.H. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Gijsens A. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), was not assessed (37Fischer G.A. Clementi E. Raichman M. Sudhof T. Ullrich A. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19216-19224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, whereas wild-type receptors had no effect on Ca2+ signaling or InsP3 formation in intact cells, a deletion mutant lacking the N-terminal InsP3-binding domain, which is analogous to the ΔInsP3RHA mutant used in the present study, enhanced the sensitivity of Ca2+ stores to InsP3 in permeabilized cells and inhibited agonist-stimulated InsP3production and [Ca2+]i increases in intact cells (37Fischer G.A. Clementi E. Raichman M. Sudhof T. Ullrich A. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19216-19224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results parallel our findings inSΔInsP3RHA and indicate that the effects of exogenous binding-defective mutants are complex. In the other study in which Ca2+ signaling was analyzed in intact cells (38Blondel O. Bell G.I. Moody M. Miller R.J. Gibbons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27167-27170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), severalfold overexpression of type III receptor in βTC-3 insulin-producing cells doubled peak [Ca2+]i in intact cells, but other parameters were not monitored. Finally, inl-cell fibroblasts, a much higher (∼8-fold) overexpression of wild-type type I receptor was achieved, and this substantially enhanced Ca2+ store sensitivity to InsP3 in permeabilized cells; however, Ca2+signaling in intact cells was not examined (33Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1990; 5: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 34Mackrill J.J. Wilcox R.A. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings are broadly in agreement with these studies, in that overexpression of either wild-type or InsP3 binding-defective mutant receptors enhances the sensitivity of Ca2+ stores to InsP3. Surprisingly, however, this enhancement was not translated into increases in [Ca2+ ]i in intact cells in response to cell surface receptor stimulation. Although in the previous study on 3T3 cells (37Fischer G.A. Clementi E. Raichman M. Sudhof T. Ullrich A. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19216-19224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) this apparent paradox was attributed to a substantial decrease in InsP3 production in response to cell surface receptor activation, such an explanation can not be applied to the present study, in which InsP3 production in response to CCh was not consistently or substantially affected by the presence of exogenous receptors. Thus, other, perhaps more subtle, mechanisms may serve to control [Ca2+]i in the transfected SH-SY5Y cells. Indeed, given the spatial and temporal complexity of Ca2+ release in intact cells (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar) and, in particular, the ability of mobilized Ca2+ to suppress further InsP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ release (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar, 40Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar), it is perhaps naive to think that an enhancement of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells will be translated into changes in [Ca2+ ]iin intact cells.The surprising ability of ΔInsP3RHA to enhance the sensitivity of Ca2+ stores to InsP3 indicates that this mutant increases the number of InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels, presumably by forming heterotetramers with endogenous receptors. The existence of these complexes is supported directly by the observed co-immunoprecipitation of exogenous and endogenous receptors and is important to the interpretation of our down-regulation data; the presence of ΔInsP3RHA in channels that are mediating Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and the fact that only endogenous receptors are down-regulated from these channels indicate that Ca2+ flux alone does not activate receptor degradation. This argues against the proposal that activation of Ca2+-dependent proteases in the vicinity of the InsP3 receptor complex might be the sole mediator of receptor degradation (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Oberdorf J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16652-16655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rather, InsP3 binding appears to be the critical signal for degradation, because only this could account for the selective degradation of endogenous receptors in ΔInsP3RHA-containing channels.Given this conclusion, it is tempting to speculate upon what it is about InsP3 binding that activates receptor degradation. InsP3 binding induces a substantial but as yet undefined conformational change in the ligand-binding domain of the type I receptor (8Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which obviously will not occur in the binding-defective mutant. This appears to be the primary consequence of InsP3binding, and it can be envisaged that such a conformational change might expose regions of the receptor that either are cleavage sites for proteases (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Oberdorf J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16652-16655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or are sites that facilitate ubiquitin conjugation (15Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12454-12461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, preliminary analysis of CCh-stimulated ubiquitination in the transfected cells suggest that the latter possibility may be correct, as endogenous receptors and InsP3RHA are ubiquitinated, but ΔInsP3RHA is not.2Finally, it is important to consider the effects of the HA tag on InsP3 receptor function and down-regulation. First, the HA tag did not appear to impair InsP3 receptor function, as expression of similar levels of InsP3R and InsP3RHA had similar effects on Ca2+mobilization in permeabilized and intact cells. However, given our inability to stably express ΔInsP3R in SH-SY5Y cells, 4Although ΔInsP3R could not be expressed stably in SH-SY5Y cells, stable expression of this mutant was possible in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3), and an analogous mutant can be expressed in 3T3 cells (37Fischer G.A. Clementi E. Raichman M. Sudhof T. Ullrich A. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19216-19224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, some cell types can tolerate ΔInsP3R. Differential tolerance may relate to differential InsP3 receptor expression; SH-SY5Y cells express almost exclusively type I receptor, whereas HEK293 and 3T3 cells express 3 and 12% type I receptor, respectively (14Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 39De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Henning R.H. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Gijsens A. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). it is possible that the tag has a subtle effect that is not detected in these assays. Perhaps ΔInsP3R is too disruptive to be stably expressed in SH-SY5Y cells, and addition of the HA tag to this mutant compensates for its disruptive effect. This speculation has a basis in studies showing that interference with the InsP3 receptor C-terminal modifies receptor function (41Nakade S. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 42Miyazaki S. Yuzaki M. Nakada K. Shirakawa H. Nakanishi S. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1992; 257: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It is also intriguing that the HA tag retards receptor down-regulation, indicating that interference with the C terminus inhibits the down-regulatory process. Thus, the C terminus may play a role in the events that lead to receptor degradation.In summary, our data show that the InsP3 receptor degradation that occurs in response to stimulation of PIC-linked cell surface receptors is activated directly by the interaction of InsP3 with its receptor. It will be intriguing to define how InsP3 binding stimulates receptor proteolysis. When certain types of G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors (for example, M3 muscarinic receptors) are occupied by their cognate agonists, phosphoinositidase C (PIC) 1The abbreviations used are: PIC, phosphoinositidase C; CCh, carbachol; HA, hemagglutinin; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3R, wild-type mouse type I InsP3 receptor; ΔInsP3R, InsP3 binding-defective mouse type I InsP3 receptor; InsP3RHA, HA epitope-tagged InsP3R; ΔInsP3RHA, HA epitope-tagged ΔInsP3R.1The abbreviations used are: PIC, phosphoinositidase C; CCh, carbachol; HA, hemagglutinin; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3R, wild-type mouse type I InsP3 receptor; ΔInsP3R, InsP3 binding-defective mouse type I InsP3 receptor; InsP3RHA, HA epitope-tagged InsP3R; ΔInsP3RHA, HA epitope-tagged ΔInsP3R. is activated, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is hydrolyzed and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol are formed (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). InsP3 is a second messenger that elicits calcium signals within cells that mediate many physiological processes (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). The primary effect of InsP3 is to trigger calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, thus raising cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) (1Berridge M.J.

This is achieved by interaction of InsP3 with InsP3 receptors, proteins that form tetrameric complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and that act as calcium channels (3Joseph S.K. Cell.

Three types of InsP3 receptor, namely, types I, II, and III, have been defined; they have similar sizes (2670–2749 amino acids) and the same basic structure (3Joseph S.K. Cell.

Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), three domains have been defined: an InsP3-binding domain within the N-terminal 650 amino acids, a transmembrane or channel-forming domain close to the C terminus, and an intervening coupling domain (3Joseph S.K.

Several lines of evidence indicate that a conformational change occurs upon InsP3binding and that this is responsible for channel opening (3Joseph S.K. Cell.

The ssDNA binding activity of ς70 is regulated allosterically through binding to the core RNAP (16Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Free ς70 binds ssDNA weakly and does not discriminate between the template and nontemplate sequences. Binding of ς70 to the core reduces the affinity of ς70 to template ssDNA and increases the affinity to nontemplate ssDNA resulting in a ∼200-fold difference in the affinity between nontemplate and template ssDNA (16Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All of the above properties of ς70 are consistent with its active role in the promoter melting reaction.Region 2.3 of ς70 is thought to be a location of the ssDNA binding site of ς70. However, the architecture of the ssDNA-ς70 complex and the structural determinants of the high selectivity for nontemplate ssDNA binding are not known. Therefore, in this work we used luminescence energy transfer (LRET) (22Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4843) Google Scholar, 23Stryer L. Annu. Rev.

The measured distances allowed us to build a model describing a three-dimensional architecture of the oligonucleotide-RNAP complex. Several conclusions regarding the architecture of the complex can be made.The oligonucleotide binds to RNAP apparently in a preferred orientation. In principle, the oligonucleotide could bind to its binding site either in 5′ → 3′ or 3′ → 5′ orientation. If the binding could occur equally well in either orientation, the apparent distances measured between sites in ς70 and the 5′- or the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide should be the same. We observed, however, that for several sites in ς70 the distances between the 5′-end and the 3′-end were very significantly different (Tables II and III), showing that the oligonucleotide was bound in one preferred orientation. Such preference for a specific orientation may be an additional mechanism by which RNAP in the open complex could discriminate between template and nontemplate strands in the transcription bubble. Previous binding experiments with oligonucleotides corresponding to the −10 region of the nontemplate and the template strand showed that RNAP holoenzyme could bind nontemplate sequence oligonucleotides ∼200-fold better then the template sequence oligonucleotides (16Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides can freely assume any orientation when they bind to the ssDNA binding site of ς70. The situation will be different in the open complex when ssDNA strands in the −10 region have restricted mobility. Thus, if the nontemplate strand in the open complex is in a correct orientation for binding to the ssDNA binding site of ς70, the template strand will be forced to be in the opposite, unfavorable for the binding orientation. Thus, the two different mechanisms for discrimination between single-stranded nontemplate and single-stranded template strands in the −10 region of promoter DNA are apparently being used by ς70. One mechanism is the sequence specificity of the binding, the other mechanism is the strand polarity specificity. This dual mode of discrimination employed by ς70 seems to be well suited for the tasks that the ssDNA binding site of ς70 needs to perform: selective binding of the −10 sequences and selective binding of the nontemplate strand.Region 2.4 (Cys-442) was found to be the closest to the oligonucleotide bound to ς70.

It appears also that the 5′-end of the bound oligonucleotide was much closer (<25 Å) to residue 442 than the 3′-end was (39 Å). Thus, the relative orientation of the bound oligonucleotide with respect to helix 14 appears to be 5′ → COOH terminus of the helix. Such an orientation is consistent with the proposed model of nontemplate ssDNA-ς70 interaction based on the crystal structure of the ς70 fragment (37Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A.

Based on these studies it was proposed that residues 437 and 440 are involved in recognition of position −12, whereas residue 441 is involved in recognition of position −13 (38Siegele D.A. Hu J.C.

Such an alignment of bases in the −10 region and amino acids in helix 14 is consistent with a 5′ → COOH terminus alignment of helix 14 and the nontemplate oligonucleotide in a holoenzyme-oligonucleotide complex. However, an opposite orientation of the nontemplate strand with respect to helix 14 was also proposed (44Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear.Cys-596 is in region 4.2 of ς70, which was suggested to bind the −35 region of promoter DNA (40Gardella T. Moyle H. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Assuming a simple linear arrangement of −10 and −35 DNA sequences and protein domains involved in binding of these sequences, it could be expected that the 5′-end of the bound oligonucleotide should be much closer to residue 596 than the 3′-end is. Data in Tables II and III show that this was not observed. In contrast, residue 596 seems to be located almost at the same distance from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the oligonucleotide. This suggests that the orientation of the bound oligonucleotide with respect to residue 596 is as illustrated in Fig. 5, i.e. it is more or less perpendicular, not parallel, to the line joining regions 2.4 and 4.2. This observation suggests that promoter DNA in the open complex is not straight, and thus formation of the open complex involves significant deformation of DNA.Based on LRET distance measurements it was possible to estimate indirectly with reasonable precision several other distances in the oligonucleotide-RNAP complex. The predicted distance between the 5′- and 3′-ends of the oligonucleotide was 32 ± 7 Å, a distance somewhat shorter than expected for a linear 12-nt DNA, consistent with the deformation of DNA in the open complex. The predicted distance between residues 366 and 442 was found to be 38 ± 6 Å. This distance is comparable, within the error of estimation, to the distance between these two residues (35 Å) observed in the crystal structure of ς70 fragment (37Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The agreement of this predicted distance with the crystal structure of the ς70fragment provides an additional validation of distances measured by LRET. The predicted distance between residues 442 and 596 was 58 ± 6 Å. Residues 442 and 596 are located in ς70 domains involved in recognition of −10 and −35 DNA sequences, which are separated by ∼17 base pairs. Thus, the predicted distance of 58 ± 6 Å is compatible with the distance expected from the ∼17-base pair separation between binding sites for these two structural domains of the protein.

The simplest two-step model describing transcription initiation (Eq. 1) involves a rapid formation of a labile “closed” complex that in a second step isomerizes to a stable “open” complex. RNAP+DNA→RNAP·DNAclosed→RNAP·DNAopenEquation 1 In the open complex 10–15 base pairs of DNA duplex become single-stranded. This DNA duplex melting in the case of E. coli RNAP occurs spontaneously, therefore the energetic cost of duplex melting must be offset by some favorable RNAP-promoter interactions. The E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme is a multisubunit enzyme (subunit composition α2ββ′ς) (1Chamberlin M. Losick R. Chamberlin M. RNA Polymerase.

The ssDNA binding activity of ς70 is regulated allosterically through binding to the core RNAP (16Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Free ς70 binds ssDNA weakly and does not discriminate between the template and nontemplate sequences. Binding of ς70 to the core reduces the affinity of ς70 to template ssDNA and increases the affinity to nontemplate ssDNA resulting in a ∼200-fold difference in the affinity between nontemplate and template ssDNA (16Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All of the above properties of ς70 are consistent with its active role in the promoter melting reaction. Region 2.3 of ς70 is thought to be a location of the ssDNA binding site of ς70. However, the architecture of the ssDNA-ς70 complex and the structural determinants of the high selectivity for nontemplate ssDNA binding are not known. Therefore, in this work we used luminescence energy transfer (LRET) (22Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4843) Google Scholar, 23Stryer L. Annu. Rev.

DISCUSSIONWe have determined the distances between several sites in the ς70 and the 5′- or the 3′-end of 12-nt nontemplate strand oligonucleotide in complex with RNAP holoenzyme. The measured distances allowed us to build a model describing a three-dimensional architecture of the oligonucleotide-RNAP complex. Several conclusions regarding the architecture of the complex can be made.The oligonucleotide binds to RNAP apparently in a preferred orientation. In principle, the oligonucleotide could bind to its binding site either in 5′ → 3′ or 3′ → 5′ orientation. If the binding could occur equally well in either orientation, the apparent distances measured between sites in ς70 and the 5′- or the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide should be the same. We observed, however, that for several sites in ς70 the distances between the 5′-end and the 3′-end were very significantly different (Tables II and III), showing that the oligonucleotide was bound in one preferred orientation. Such preference for a specific orientation may be an additional mechanism by which RNAP in the open complex could discriminate between template and nontemplate strands in the transcription bubble. Previous binding experiments with oligonucleotides corresponding to the −10 region of the nontemplate and the template strand showed that RNAP holoenzyme could bind nontemplate sequence oligonucleotides ∼200-fold better then the template sequence oligonucleotides (16Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides can freely assume any orientation when they bind to the ssDNA binding site of ς70. The situation will be different in the open complex when ssDNA strands in the −10 region have restricted mobility. Thus, if the nontemplate strand in the open complex is in a correct orientation for binding to the ssDNA binding site of ς70, the template strand will be forced to be in the opposite, unfavorable for the binding orientation. Thus, the two different mechanisms for discrimination between single-stranded nontemplate and single-stranded template strands in the −10 region of promoter DNA are apparently being used by ς70. One mechanism is the sequence specificity of the binding, the other mechanism is the strand polarity specificity. This dual mode of discrimination employed by ς70 seems to be well suited for the tasks that the ssDNA binding site of ς70 needs to perform: selective binding of the −10 sequences and selective binding of the nontemplate strand.Region 2.4 (Cys-442) was found to be the closest to the oligonucleotide bound to ς70. This is consistent and confirms the proposals that the ssDNA binding site of ς70 is localized in region 2.3 (13Marr M.T. Roberts J.W.

It appears also that the 5′-end of the bound oligonucleotide was much closer (<25 Å) to residue 442 than the 3′-end was (39 Å).

Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar)). It appears also that the 5′-end of the bound oligonucleotide was much closer (<25 Å) to residue 442 than the 3′-end was (39 Å). Thus, the relative orientation of the bound oligonucleotide with respect to helix 14 appears to be 5′ → COOH terminus of the helix. Such an orientation is consistent with the proposed model of nontemplate ssDNA-ς70 interaction based on the crystal structure of the ς70 fragment (37Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with data relating mutations in ς70 and mutations in the −10 region of promoter DNA. Based on these studies it was proposed that residues 437 and 440 are involved in recognition of position −12, whereas residue 441 is involved in recognition of position −13 (38Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar,39Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol.

Carter H.L. Cutting S. Moran C.P. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Such an alignment of bases in the −10 region and amino acids in helix 14 is consistent with a 5′ → COOH terminus alignment of helix 14 and the nontemplate oligonucleotide in a holoenzyme-oligonucleotide complex. However, an opposite orientation of the nontemplate strand with respect to helix 14 was also proposed (44Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. Cys-596 is in region 4.2 of ς70, which was suggested to bind the −35 region of promoter DNA (40Gardella T. Moyle H. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Assuming a simple linear arrangement of −10 and −35 DNA sequences and protein domains involved in binding of these sequences, it could be expected that the 5′-end of the bound oligonucleotide should be much closer to residue 596 than the 3′-end is. Data in Tables II and III show that this was not observed. In contrast, residue 596 seems to be located almost at the same distance from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the oligonucleotide. This suggests that the orientation of the bound oligonucleotide with respect to residue 596 is as illustrated in Fig. 5, i.e. it is more or less perpendicular, not parallel, to the line joining regions 2.4 and 4.2. This observation suggests that promoter DNA in the open complex is not straight, and thus formation of the open complex involves significant deformation of DNA. Based on LRET distance measurements it was possible to estimate indirectly with reasonable precision several other distances in the oligonucleotide-RNAP complex. The predicted distance between the 5′- and 3′-ends of the oligonucleotide was 32 ± 7 Å, a distance somewhat shorter than expected for a linear 12-nt DNA, consistent with the deformation of DNA in the open complex. The predicted distance between residues 366 and 442 was found to be 38 ± 6 Å. This distance is comparable, within the error of estimation, to the distance between these two residues (35 Å) observed in the crystal structure of ς70 fragment (37Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The agreement of this predicted distance with the crystal structure of the ς70fragment provides an additional validation of distances measured by LRET. The predicted distance between residues 442 and 596 was 58 ± 6 Å. Residues 442 and 596 are located in ς70 domains involved in recognition of −10 and −35 DNA sequences, which are separated by ∼17 base pairs. Thus, the predicted distance of 58 ± 6 Å is compatible with the distance expected from the ∼17-base pair separation between binding sites for these two structural domains of the protein."

Three forms of SOD have been identified in eukaryotic cells: the cytoplasmic copper/zinc SOD (Cu,Zn-SOD), the extracellular Cu,Zn-SOD, and the mitochondrial manganese SOD (Mn-SOD). In contrast to the cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD, which is expressed constitutively in most cases, Mn-SOD expression is highly regulated by a variety of proinflammatory mediators (5Czaja M.J. Schilsky M.L.

Recent data have decisively demonstrated the critical cellular importance of Mn-SOD in a variety of different tissues. For example, homozygous mutant Mn-SOD mice die within 10 days of birth, exhibiting severe dilated cardiomyopathy, lipid accumulation in liver and skeletal muscle, and metabolic acidosis, as well as decreased enzyme activity of aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase, and cytochromec oxidase, which are all extremely sensitive to alterations in the cellular redox state (10Li Y.

Additionally, transgenic mice expressing elevated levels of human Mn-SOD in lung tissue were highly protected from hyperoxic injury after exposure to 95% oxygen and thus survived longer than nontransgenic littermates (11Wispé J.R.

Overexpression ofMn-SOD has also been implicated in the suppression of tumorigenicity of human melanoma cells (12Church S.L. Grant J.W. Ridnour L.A. Oberley L.W. Swanson P.E. Meltzer P.S. Trent J.M.

Alterations in Mn-SOD levels have also been associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (15Eggers B. Kurth J.H. Kurth M.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55 (abstr.): 183Google Scholar), Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Kennedy-Alter-Sung syndrome (16Yahara O. Hashimoto K. Taniguchi N. Ishikawa M. Sato Y. Yamashita H. Ohno H. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1991; 72: 315-326PubMed Google Scholar). Mn-SOD synthesis in eukaryotic cells is up-regulated dramatically by proinflammatory mediators including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukins-1 and -6 (IL-1 and IL-6), and interferon-γ (6Dougall W.C.

This up-regulation is blocked completely by actinomycin D, suggesting that the increase inMn-SOD mRNA in response to LPS, TNF-α, or IL-1 may result from an increase in the rate of transcription ofMn-SOD (7Valentine J.F.

Although highly regulated, Mn-SOD contains a GC-rich promoter lacking a TATA- and a CAAT-box. This promoter architecture was originally associated with housekeeping genes that are constitutively expressed (22Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The additional layer of transcriptional regulation of this gene differentiates it from most housekeeping genes. Unfortunately, current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms controlling transcriptional regulation from promoters that lack a TATA- and CAAT-box is limited. Most of the studies addressing regulation of TATA- or CAAT-less promoters have focused on either the initiator element (Inr), which controls transcriptional initiation (23Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), or the general transcription machinery, especially TFIID (24Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 25Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 26Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, most studies have analyzed transcription from TATA- or CAAT-less promoters by employing naked DNA templates in vitro, a model system that may not adequately reflect the physiological situation. In order to explore the mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of this unique TATA- and CAAT-less gene promoter, we first investigated alterations in the chromatin structure of rat Mn-SOD by mapping regions hypersensitive (HS) to cleavage by DNase I in both control and stimulated cells. To further delineate the binding of specific transcription factor(s) in the proximal promoter ofMn-SOD, we used in vivo footprinting coupled with ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) to screen the region surrounding the prominent promoter HS site and the transcriptional initiation site in both control and induced cells. Our findings have provided evidence for the molecular architecture within the promoter of this TATA and CAAT-less gene. The L2 rat pulmonary epithelial-like cell line (ATCC CCL 149) was grown as a monolayer in 150-mm cell culture dishes containing Ham's modified F12K medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml penicillin G, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. At approximately 90% confluence, cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml Escherichia coli LPS (E. coli serotype 055:B5, Sigma), 10 ng/ml TNF-α (kindly provided by the Genentech Corp.), or 2 ng/ml IL-1β (kindly provided by NCI, National Institutes of Health) for 0.5–8 h to induce Mn-SOD expression. Untreated cells were used as controls. We employed isolated nuclei for low resolution DNase I HS site studies and permeabilized cells to analyze HS site 1 at high resolution. To analyze DNase I HS sites at low resolution, nuclei were isolated essentially as described (28Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). For high resolution DNase I HS site studies, L2 cells were permeabilized in 4 ml of cold nuclear isolation buffer (60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.05% lysophosphatidylcholine (Sigma) for 1 min on ice (29Miller M.R. Castellot Jr., J.J. Pardee A.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Aliquots of approximately 3 × 107 permeabilized cells/ml of nuclear isolation buffer were digested with increasing concentrations of DNase I (Worthington) at 37 °C for 4 min. Digestions were terminated by dilution to a final concentration of 1% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 50 μg/ml proteinase K. Genomic DNA was purified by incubation at 55 °C for 3 h followed by organic extractions and precipitation with ethanol. Samples were then treated with 100 μg/ml RNase A, organically extracted, precipitated, and suspended in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). DNase I-digested DNA was restricted with an appropriate enzyme and size-fractionated on either of two gel systems to achieve the desired resolution: a low resolution 1% agarose gel (FMC BioProducts) in TAE buffer, pH 7.8 (40 mm Tris, 3 mm NaOAc·3H2O, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm NaOH) to resolve DNA fragments ranging from 0.5 to 15 kilobase pairs or a high resolution procedure that utilizes a 2.5% Metaphor agarose gel (FMC BioProducts) in TAE buffer to resolve DNA fragments ranging from 0.1 to 1 kilobase pair. The DNA was alkaline-denatured, electrotransferred to a nylon membrane, and cross-linked to the membrane with UV light (30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). The membrane was prehybridized in a buffer containing 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 15 min. The DNA fragments used for probe templates were isolated by restriction digestion of various subclones of the rat Mn-SOD genomic clone (31Hurt J. Hsu J-L. Dougall W.C. Visner G.A. Burr I.M. Nick H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and radiolabeled using a random primer DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Hybridization and autoradiography were performed as described (8Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L2 cells at 90% confluence were washed with room temperature phosphate-buffered saline buffer and then replaced with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5–0.25% DMS for 1–2 min at room temperature. The cell monolayer was washed with 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline to quench the DMS reaction. The cells were lysed in 67 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, and 0.6 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated overnight at room temperature. Genomic DNA was purified as described for DNase I HS site studies. The DNA samples were digested with BamHI, and strand cleavage at modified guanine residues was achieved by treatment with 1 m piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min. Naked genomic DNA was harvested and purified from cells without any DMS treatment and digested with BamHI. The in vitroguanine-specific reaction was performed as described (30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). The LMPCR was performed as described previously (32Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The following primers were used for LMPCR. For the top strand primer sets, the following were used: A, primer 1, 5′-TTGTGCCGCTCTGTTACAAG-3′ and primer 2, 5′-GTGTCGCGGTCCTCCCCTCCGTTGATG-3′; B, primer 1, 5′-ATTGTAGCTCACAGGCAGAG-3′ and primer 2, 5′-GGGCCTAGTCTGAGGGTGGAGCATA-3′; C, primer 1, 5′-TGATTACGCCATGGCTCTGA-3′ and primer 2, 5′-TCTGACCAGCAGCAGGGCCCTGGCTT-3′; D, primer 1, 5′-GTTAATTGCGAGGCTGGCAA-3′ and primer 2, 5′-CCCTAACCTCAGGGGCAACAAAG-3′; E, primer 1, 5′-GTCGTTTTACATTTATGGTGG-3′ and primer 2, 5′-GGGTTTAGTCAGGAAAGATGAACCTGGC-3′; F, primer 1, 5′-GGAAAAACCACCCGGAAC-3′ and primer 2, 5′-CAGTGGCAGAGGAAAGCTGCC-3′.

The polymerase chain reaction products were size-fractionated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred to a nylon membrane, and covalently cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation. The membrane was hybridized with an M13 single-stranded probe using our isolated genomic clone as template and promoter-specific primers for extension, washed as described for DNase I hypersensitive site studies, and exposed to x-ray film. The rat Mn-SOD promoter from position −467 to +32 was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Human Sp1 protein was purchased from Promega, and the purified gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF) fusion protein containing the three-zinc finger DNA binding domain was kindly provided by Dr. Vincent W. Yang (Johns Hopkins University) (33Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Sp1 (26 pmol) and/or GKLF (170 pmol) was incubated with linearized pCR2.1 containing the rat Mn-SOD promoter in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 μmZnCl2 followed by DMS treatment in vitro.DMS-modified protein-DNA complexes and naked template DNA were cleaved, gel-fractionated, and transferred to a nylon membrane as described above. Two oligonucleotides, 5′-ACACGGCCGTTCGCTAGCAGCC-3′ and 5′-TCTGACCAGCAGCAGGGCCCTGGCTT-3′, were used as hybridization probes as described (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.42-16.44Google Scholar) for visualization of top and bottom strand sequences, respectively. Transfection efficiency was controlled by using a batch transfection method. Cell monolayers were grown to 70–90% confluency on 150-mm plates. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of each expression vector using the DEAE-dextran method (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.42-16.44Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were trypsinized, pooled, and plated onto four separate 100-mm tissue culture plates. Inflammatory mediators were added to the medium of each plate 24 h later as described above. Twenty-four hours later, total RNA was isolated from the cell monolayers for Northern analysis as described (8Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human growth hormone was assayed from the media of individual 100-mm plates incubated for 48 h after the addition of LPS, TNF-α, or IL-1β. Each vector was tested in more than four independent experiments, bringing the number of independently transfected plates to approximately 16 for each vector. The concentration of secreted hGH was measured using an125I-labeled monoclonal antibody assay kit purchased from Nichols Institute Diagnostics with a lower limit sensitivity of 0.06 ng/ml. Each experimental sample was assayed in duplicate. A 4.5-kbEcoRI/EagI fragment of 5′ noncoding sequence was isolated from the 17-kb Mn-SOD genomic clone (31Hurt J. Hsu J-L. Dougall W.C. Visner G.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the 5′ overhang ends were filled in using the large fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). The resulting blunt end Eco/Eag fragment was cloned into the HincII polylinker site in a promoterless, pUC 12-based human growth hormone expression vector, pϕGH, (Nichols Institute Diagnostics). Unique restriction enzyme sites were utilized to delete increasing portions of theMn-SOD Eco/E sequence, creating the vectors illustrated in Fig. 8 A. The induction ofMn-SOD mRNA by LPS, TNF-α, or IL-1β may be a consequence of de novo transcription rate, the prolongation of Mn-SOD mRNA half-life, or both. Co-treatment of induced cells with actinomycin D indicates that de novotranscription is necessary for stimulus-dependent gene expression. To address the contribution of these proinflammatory mediators to the induced steady-state message levels, nascent transcription was evaluated in both isolated nuclei and lysophosphatidylcholine-permeabilized cells. These nuclear run-on studies showed that LPS, TNF-α, or IL1-β treatment increased the rate of transcription of Mn-SOD over control by 3–9-fold (data not shown). Since de novo transcription is necessary for the induction of Mn-SOD by LPS, TNF-α, or IL-1β, we next evaluated alterations in the chromatin structure of Mn-SOD in response to these mediators. Nuclei were isolated from control and stimulated L2 cells, a rat pulmonary epithelial-like cell line, and then exposed to increasing concentrations of DNase I. Purified genomic DNA was then digested with restriction enzymes near the region of interest and size fractionated on 1% agarose gels. Fig.1 A shows a low resolution Southern analysis of DNase I-digested DNA restricted withKpnI and indirectly end-labeled with the probe designated PK, which abuts the 5′ KpnI site. HS site 1 maps to the promoter region of Mn-SOD, whereas HS sites 2–7 map within the gene itself. These seven HS sites that were found in both control and stimulated cells are shown on the restriction map ofMn-SOD in Fig. 1 A. We also evaluated regions approximately 10 kilobase pairs 5′ to HS site 1 and 3′ to HS site 7 and detected no additional hypersensitive sites near Mn-SOD. In addition, DNase I digestion of deproteinated genomic DNA demonstrated that all of these HS sites are specific to in vivo chromatin structure (data not shown). Since no differences in chromatin structure were detected between control and induced cells, we hypothesized that stimulus-specific alterations in chromatin structure may occur within each HS site. HS site 1 was chosen based on its proximity to the transcriptional initiation site and because this site is highly sensitive to cleavage by DNase I. In order to display the structure of the HS site in the promoter in more detail, we digested genomic DNA with BamHI, which cleaves near HS site 1 followed by Southern analysis with probe BH. This strategy expanded the separation of the DNase I-cleaved fragments and led to the discovery that HS site 1 was composed of three subsites (marked with stars in Fig. 1) in control and stimulated cells. Most interestingly, a fourth subsite became strongly apparent only in the samples derived from LPS-, TNF-α-, or IL-1β-treated cells, as shown in Fig. 1 B. To better resolve potential stimulus-dependent alterations in chromatin structure, we developed an approach to evaluate changes within HS site 1 at higher resolution. The DNase I cleavage pattern was analyzed by fractionation on a 2.5% Metaphor agarose gel. This gel accurately resolves fragments differing in size by as little as 2% in the range of 200–800 bp. In addition, we utilized control and LPS-, TNF-α-, or IL-1β-stimulated cells permeabilized with lysophosphatidylcholine rather than isolated nuclei in order to more efficiently retain intact protein-DNA complexes, as has been previously reported (35Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). L2 cells were treated with LPS, TNF-α, or IL-1β for 4 h, permeabilized as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” and incubated with increasing concentrations of DNase I. The DNase I-cleaved genomic DNA was then purified, digested with the restriction endonucleases HincII and RsaI, and size-fractionated on 2.5% Metaphor agarose gels. Hybridization with probe HN revealed five discrete DNase I HS regions, indicated as HS subsites 1-1 to 1-5 (Fig. 2). The HS subsites 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 were found in both control and treated cells, implying that these four HS subsites are involved in basal expression of Mn-SOD. Most importantly, an inducible HS site, subsite 1–5, was found only in cells treated with LPS (Fig. 2). The same subsite was also observed following treatment with TNF-α and IL-1β (data not shown). This suggests that the promoter region around HS subsite 1-5 may be involved in specific alterations in chromatin structure that accompany gene activation. Low resolution (Fig. 1) and high resolution DNase I HS site studies (Fig. 2) suggest that important cis-acting regulatory elements may exist in the promoter region of Mn-SOD in both control and stimulated cells. We therefore employed in vivo footprinting using DMS as a molecular probe coupled with LMPCR to resolve thesecis-acting elements at single nucleotide resolution and thus display the in vivo protein-DNA contacts. The position of each LMPCR primer set is shown in Fig.3 A. In order to verify that the kinetics of transcription factor binding are stable throughout the period of induction with LPS, we tested both control and stimulated samples at 0.5, 4, and 8 h of treatment. These experiments demonstrated that the observed protein-DNA contacts are detectable as early as 0.5 h and as late as 8 h after the addition of LPS with representative examples from each time point illustrated in Figs.3 and 4.Figure 4In vivo DMS footprinting: identification of basal binding sites II–X in the promoter ofMn-SOD.

Fig. 3 C illustrates control and 4-h LPS-treated samples for the bottom strand. As depicted in Fig.3, numerous guanine residues exhibited altered DMS reactivity, which appeared as either diminished or enhanced hybridization signal relative to the in vitro DMS-treated DNA lanes. We have summarized this in vivo footprinting data by postulating the existence of protein binding sites at obviously clustered residues and through symmetry in the contacts and in the DNA sequence. Fig. 3, Band C, illustrates binding sites for proteins I–VI. Fig. 4,A and B, illustrates the protein-DNA contacts seen in cells stimulated for 8 and 4 h of LPS on the top and bottom strands, respectively. Binding sites II–VII are shown in Fig.4 A, while Fig. 4 B illustrates binding sites VI, VIII, IX, and X. Interestingly, in addition to the guanine contact sites, we also observed consistently reproducible enhanced adenine residues marked by arrowheads in Figs. 3 and 4, which are also clustered near specific binding sites. A computer analysis of binding sites I–III shows a high degree of homology with the consensus DNA binding sequence and the protein-DNA contact pattern of Sp1 (36Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar), thus suggesting that these sites may be occupied by Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins. Furthermore, binding sites IV and V contain the minimal essential DNA binding sequence, 5′-(G/A)(G/A)GG(C/T)- G(C/T)-3′, of a recently cloned transcription factor, GKLF (33Shields J.M. Yang V.W.

To understand this phenomenon better, a gel retardation assay was used to measure the equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of an exonuclease-deficient Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) to DNA primer-templates modified with an AAF or AF adduct. The results indicate that the nature of the adduct as well as the presence and nature of an added dNTP have a significant influence on the strength of the binding of the polymerase to the DNA. More specifically, it was found that the binding is 5–10-fold stronger when an AAF adduct, but not an AF adduct, is positioned in the enzyme active site. In addition, the polymerase was found to bind the unmodified primer-template less strongly in the presence of a noncomplementary dNTP than in the presence of the correct nucleotide. The same trend holds true for the primer-template having an AF adduct, although the magnitude of this difference was lower. In the case of the AAF adduct, the interaction of the polymerase with the primer-template was stronger and almost independent of the nucleotide present.

In the case of the AAF adduct, the interaction of the polymerase with the primer-template was stronger and almost independent of the nucleotide present. It is well established that the presence of DNA adducts in the template strand can impede or block DNA synthesis at a replication fork. Although most bulky adducts inhibit DNA synthesis strongly, some can be bypassed readily in vitro. The well studied carcinogen N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) 1The abbreviations used are: AAF, N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene; AF, N-2-aminofluorene; dG-C8-AAF, N-(2′-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetyl-aminofluorene; dG-C8-AF, N-(2′-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. can form both types of adducts in DNA; N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene adducts (dG-C8-AAF) are known to be strong blocks to DNA synthesis, whereas N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene adducts (dG-C8-AF) can be bypassed by all polymerases tested (1Heflich R.H. Neft R.E. Mutat. Res. 1994; 318: 73-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The mutagenic consequences of each adduct are also quite distinct. The dG-C8-AAF adduct results in mostly frameshift mutations in bacteria, whereas the dG-C8-AF adduct produces predominantly base substitution mutations (2Hoffmann G.R. Fuchs R.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3Belguise-Valladier P. Fuchs R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Doisy R. Tang M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4358-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These different properties are likely to be the result of differences in the structures that these adducts assume in DNA in the active site of the DNA polymerase. Structural and enzymatic studies on duplex DNA molecules have demonstrated that the AF adduct produces less distortion in the DNA helix than the AAF adduct (2Hoffmann G.R. Fuchs R.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Patel D.J. Mao B. Gu Z. Hingerty B.E. Gorin A. Basu A.K. Broyde S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Multidimensional NMR experiments show that the guanine bearing the C8-AAF adduct rotates from anti to synconformation in the double-stranded DNA helix with the fluorene ring inserted into the helix (base displacement model (6O'Handley S.F. Sanford D.G. Xu R. Lester C.C. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Krugh T.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2481-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)). This contrasts with the AF adduct, which can adopt interchangeable conformations: in one the fluorene remains outside the helix (outside binding model), whereas the other has the fluorene ring stacked within the helix (5Patel D.J. Mao B. Gu Z. Hingerty B.E. Gorin A. Basu A.K. Broyde S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The ratio of these conformations seems to be dependent on the sequence within which the adduct lies (7Mao B. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although it has been assumed that the structural differences between the AAF and AF adducts are responsible for the observed in the biological effects, the molecular mechanism that is operating is not known in any detail. The Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I is a 68-kDa protein that carries a polymerase and 3′–5′-exonuclease activities on a single polypeptide chain. Because of its simple structure, this enzyme has served as a model enzyme for studying the mechanism of DNA synthesis for three decades. In efforts to understand this process better, several crystal structures of the Klenow fragment and other polymerases have been solved (8Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 9Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 10Doublie S.

Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In addition, pre-steady-state kinetic experiments have provided a quantitative description of each step in the nucleotide insertion pathway by Klenow fragment (14Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8410-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 15Kuchta R.D. Benkovic P. Benkovic S.J.

It is widely accepted that the process of incorporation of a dNTP into the nascent DNA chain involves a number of sequential steps that are generally described in terms of two different conformations of the DNA polymerase. It is thought that in the open conformation the polymerase can bind to the primer terminus after which it is converted to the closed conformation by the incoming dNTP (17Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 18Von Hippel P.H. Fairfield F.R. Dolejsi M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Upon formation of a new phosphodiester bond, pyrophosphate is released, and the DNA polymerase returns to the open conformation, allowing for translocation of the enzyme to the new primer terminus. The nonchemical event that occurs between nucleotide binding and phosphodiester bond formation (presumably the conformational change) has been shown to limit the rate of incorporation of a correct nucleotide (14Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8410-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), whereas the chemical step itself limits the rate of a nucleotide misincorporation (15Kuchta R.D. Benkovic P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6716-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These results, together with the fact that the energy difference between right (Watson-Crick) versus wrong (non-Watson-Crick) base pairing cannot account for the extraordinary fidelity of DNA replication (10−6–10−7 even in the absence of proofreading), imply a selection mechanism based on the geometry of the base pair and the protein active site. In this model, a wrong nucleotide cannot be positioned properly for the nucleophilic attack in the active site of the polymerase, and this slows down the rate of the bond formation significantly. The major role of the base pair geometry in replication has been confirmed recently by Kool and co-workers (19Moran S. Ren R.X. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10506-10511Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar,20Liu D. Moran S. Kool E.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), who showed that a thimidine triphosphate shape analog lacking Watson-Crick pairing ability is replicated with high sequence selectivity. In the present study we have determined the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction of Klenow fragment with AF- and AAF-modified primer-templates and compared them with the values for unmodified primer-templates in the presence or absence of dNTPs. Our results demonstrate that the enzyme-DNA complex is stabilized by the presence of the next correct nucleotide, but binding is weaker when a noncomplementary nucleotide is present. Binding of the polymerase to AAF-modified DNA was stronger and almost independent of the nature of the nucleotide present. These data provide additional insight into the mechanisms of replication and mutagenesis. The Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (exonuclease-free) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The protein had been overexpressed and purified from a strain carrying a double mutation D355A,E357A, which results in about a 105-fold reduction of endogenous 3′–5′-exonuclease activity (11Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). T7 DNA polymerase (exo−), T4 polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA ligase were also purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Midland Certified, Inc. Site-specifically modified 12-mer (GTGATG(C8-AAF)ATAAGT) was synthesized and purified as described previously (21Zhou Y. Romano L.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14043-14052Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All dNTPs and dideoxy-NTPs were ordered from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [γ-32P]ATP was from ICN Biomedicals. The sequences of oligonucleotides that were used in this study to create model primer-templates are shown in Fig.1. The 28-mer template oligonucleotide was modified with an AF or AAF adduct at G6, which positions the adduct on the junction of the single strand and double strand when the 22-mer is used as a primer and leaves it in the single-stranded region when the 20-mer or the 21-mer is annealed to the template. The 21-mer and 22-mer either had the normal 3′-OH or lacked the 3′-hydroxyl to prevent a nucleotide incorporation. Construction and purification of all oligonucleotides are described below. All synthetic oligonucleotides used in this study were first purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To construct the 28-mer with a single AAF adduct at position G6 (Fig. 1), the site-specifically modified 12-mer was ligated to a 5′-phosphorylated 16-mer, using a 21-mer as a template. The ligated 28-mer containing the adduct and the complementary 21-mer were denatured and separated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 8 m urea. The AAF-modified 28-mer was then recovered from the gel and desalted with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Chromatography) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The 28-mer containing the AF adduct was obtained by treatment of the AAF-modified 28-mer with 0.1 m NaOH in the presence of 0.2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol as described (22Shibutani S. Gentles R. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification. The HPLC separation was carried out on a Hamilton PRP-1 350 × 7-mm column. The running buffer contained 0.5–15% acetonitrile in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, over 30 min with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. A 21-mer and 22-mer lacking a 3′-OH were obtained by extension of the corresponding 20-mer and 21-mer according to the following procedure. First, the primers was labeled at the 5′-end by [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The32P-labeled 20-mer and 21-mer were then annealed to the template 28-mer in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl. The corresponding dideoxy-NTP (0.4 mm) and Sequanase 2.0 (2 units) were added to the reaction mixture. The resulting 21-mer and 22-mer were purified by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gel with 8 m urea. To show the absence of a 3′-OH on the primer terminus of the oligonucleotides, primer extension reactions were carried out using these oligonucleotides as primers. Thus, primer-templates consisting of an unmodified 28-mer and the32P-labeled primer (approximately 1 nm each) were incubated with a 0.4 mm concentration of each of the four dNTPs and 2 units of the Klenow fragment in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, containing 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 2-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken, and the reaction was stopped with 10 μl of gel loading buffer containing 90% formamide and 5 mg/ml bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. The samples were analyzed on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). An identical procedure was used for the primer extension studies on the AAF- and AF-modified templates (Fig. 3).Figure 3Primer extension analysis of AF- and AAF-modified primer-templates. The 21-mer primer was annealed to either the unmodified 28-mer or the AAF- or AF-containing template. Primer extension was carried out using the Klenow fragment (exo−), and the reaction was terminated after the period of time indicated under each lane as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Determination of the equilibrium dissociation constants for the polymerase-primer templates was carried out by a method similar to that described by Astatke et al.(23Astatke M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This method has been employed successfully to measure the binding constants for DNA polymerase I and polymerase I mutants (23Astatke M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The DNA binding reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4% glycerol. The binding was carried out at 25 °C for 30 min in a 10-μl reaction containing 10–100 pm labeled duplex DNA, increasing amounts of Klenow exo− (typically 0.05–81 nm), and 36 mm dNTP (if present). The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a native 7% polyacrylamide gel preequilibrated with 0.4 × TB buffer (0.04 m Tris borate, pH 8.3). Gels were fixed with 7% acetic acid, dried, and scanned using a PhosphorImager. The amount of complex formed at equilibrium was estimated as the difference in the band intensities of free primer-template and the intensity of this band without the polymerase addition. The dissociation constant (Kd) of a protein-DNA complex measured by gel retardation assay is equal to the protein concentration at which half of the DNA is bound to the protein, providing that protein concentration used is much higher than the DNA concentration. The protein-bound and free oligonucleotides separated by gel electrophoresis were quantified by scanning the gels in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SF. To obtain the Kd, the fraction of the DNA bound to the protein was plotted against the initial protein concentrations, and the data were analyzed using the program Ultrafit (Biosoft, Cambridge, U. K.) and fitted to the equation for single-site ligand binding. The values for theKd ± S.E. were obtained from the resulting fit of this equation. The dG-C8-AAF adduct is generally known to block DNA replication much more strongly than the dG-C8-AF adduct, but this effect depends upon the sequence context and the polymerase used. To test the effect of these adducts in the particular system used in this study, primer extension analysis was carried out using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, the 21-mer as a primer, and the AAF- or AF-modified 28-mer template. In agreement with previous studies, we find here that the AAF adduct is much more inhibitory of DNA synthesis than the AF adduct (Fig.3). In fact the results obtained for the unmodified and AF-modified templates are almost identical, whereas the AAF-modified template gave less than 3% bypass at the experimental conditions used. Note also that the presence of some unextended primer is presumably the result of a slight molecular excess of the primer and a small fraction of the duplex which denatures during the incubation. To determine the dissociation constants for the binding of the Klenow fragment to DNA, 32P-labeled primers were annealed to the templates, and these duplexes were incubated with increasing amounts of polymerase. These mixtures were then immediately loaded and run on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel producing a band that was the result of the formation of the polymerase-DNA complex (Fig.4 A). The small amount of free primer is caused by the dissociation of the primer-template which is unavoidable at the low DNA concentrations used for these experiments. The polymerase does not form any detectable complexes with the single-stranded primer even at protein concentrations much higher than that used in this study (Fig. 4 A, lane 9), nor does it bind to the modified or unmodified templates (not shown). The amount of complex formed at equilibrium was estimated from the ratio of band intensities of free primer-template to the intensity of this band without the addition of polymerase. This analysis allows measurement of the amount of complex formed in solution before it was loaded on the gel and the neglect of the slight amount of dissociation of DNA-protein complexes which occurs in the gel. The data obtained this way were then fitted to an equation for single-site ligand binding (Fig.4 B), and apparent K dvalues were calculated. A slight variation of this method was used successfully in prior studies to determine the dissociation constants for polymerase I binding to primer-templates (23Astatke M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the presence of dNTPs on the dissociation constant, the binding experiments need to be carried out under the conditions where nucleotides cannot be incorporated. To prevent this reaction, a primer-template having a dideoxynucleotide on the 3′- end of the primer was prepared and used to form the primer-template. In the absence of a dNTP, the dissociation constant determined for interaction of the protein with the 3′-dideoxy terminated primer-template was found to be identical to that for interactions with normal primer-templates (TableI). Consistent with the available structural information (8Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), this result implies that there is no direct interaction of the DNA polymerase active site carboxylates with the 3′-OH of the primer terminus in the ground state. Also, as shown below, binding was the same in the presence and absence of a 3′-OH in the primer for the modified templates.Table IDissociation constants of the Klenow fragment-DNA complexes in the absence of dNTPs in which the adducts are positioned in the polymerase active siteTemplateK d of 22-mer primer3′-OH3′-HnmUnmodified0.46 ± 0.200.40 ± 0.20AAF-modified0.07 ± 0.030.05 ± 0.02AF-modified0.41 ± 0.220.38 ± 0.06The primer-templates used in the binding studies are described in Fig.1.

The K d values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” by measuring the difference in the band intensities of the free primer-template and the intensity of this band before the addition of the polymerase and plotting the fraction of bound DNA versus the initial protein concentration (Fig. 4). To gain an understanding of which step of a nucleotide incorporation is influenced by the DNA adduct, we first determined the dissociation constants in the absence of dNTPs for the Klenow fragment on primer-templates containing AAF and AF adducts (Table I). These data indicate that when the AAF adduct is positioned so that it is the next position for incorporation, the polymerase binding is about 10-fold stronger than to the unmodified primer template. Surprisingly, binding to an identical template but containing an AF adduct gave dissociation constants identical to the unmodified template. The absence of a 3′-OH had no effect on these results (Table I). If the adduct is positioned at the +1 or +2 position in line for incorporation, placing them in the single-stranded region of the template, then no differences were observed between the unmodified or modified templates (TableII), suggesting that the interaction with the AAF adduct was highly dependent on the position in which it resided within the active site.Table IIDissociation constants of the Klenow fragment-DNA complexes in which the adducts are not in the active siteTemplateK d20-mer-3′-OH21-mer-3′-OHnmUnmodified0.10 ± 0.020.27 ± 0.10AAF-modified0.08 ± 0.020.25 ± 0.15AF-modified0.14 ± 0.080.25 ± 0.14The primer-templates used in the binding studies are described in Fig.1.

The K d values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” by measuring the difference in the band intensities of the free primer-template and the intensity of this band before the addition of the polymerase and plotting the fraction of bound DNA versus the initial protein concentration (Fig. 4). It has been shown that E. coli DNA polymerase I shows little discrimination against nonpairing dNTPs at the stage of nucleotide binding (24Eger B.T. Kuchta R.D. Carroll S.S. Benkovic P.A. Dahlberg M.E. Joyce C.M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1441-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus the dissociation constants for the four nucleotides from the polymerase bound to the primer-template junction are approximately the same. However, the dissociation constants for the polymerase in the presence of each nucleotide have never been measured. To make these measurements, we prepared primer-templates where the primer contained a 3′-dideoxy-terminated nucleotide and measured the dissociation constants of the polymerase in the presence of each dNTP. Interestingly, unlike the data measured for dNTP dissociation, the binding of the polymerase to DNA is much stronger in the presence of the correctly paired nucleotide than in the presence of an incorrect nucleotide (Table III). Indeed, the complex is about 100 times more stable when the next correct nucleotide (dCTP in this case) is present than in the presence of a dATP or dGTP and about 15 times more stable in the presence of another pyrimidine, dTTP. Virtually identical results were obtained for an unmodified template using a 3′-dideoxy-terminated 21-mer primer; in this case the next correct nucleotide (dTTP) caused the strongest binding, dATP and dGTP caused 100-fold higher dissociation constants, and dCTP was about 10-fold higher (data not shown). Thus the differences in binding are not the result of a special interaction with one of the nucleotides but are clearly dependent on having the correct versus incorrect nucleotide bound in the active site.Table IIIDissociation constants for the 22-mer (3′H) template complexes in the presence of each dNTPTemplateKdCGATnmUnmodified0.10 ± 0.0622 ± 149.0 ± 6.01.6 ± 0.6AAF-modified0.14 ± 0.100.06 ± 0.030.17 ± 0.100.20 ± 0.14AF-modified0.9 ± 0.43.5 ± 2.02.2 ± 1.00.7 ± 0.2The primer-templates used in the binding studies are described in Fig. 1.

The K d values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” by measuring the difference in the band intensities of the free primer-template and the intensity of this band before the addition of the polymerase and plotting the fraction of bound DNA versus the initial protein concentration (Fig.4). When the binding studies were carried out on the primer-template that positions an AAF adduct in the active site of the polymerase, the presence or identity of the dNTP had no effect on the dissociation constants; in all cases the Kd was about 0.1 nm (Table III), very close to the value in the absence of the nucleotide for the AAF-modified primer-template (Table I). When an AF adduct was present in the active site of the protein, theKd in each case was intermediate between the value determined for binding to the unmodified and AAF-modified primer-template (Table III). The only exception was dCTP, the next correct nucleotide, where the binding strength was lower than that determined for the unmodified and AAF-modified templates. Acetylaminofluorene adducts have been studied intensively as model DNA lesions to understand the mechanism of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Despite a great deal of structural, mutational, and kinetic data available regarding these DNA lesions, the exact mechanism of the mutagenicity and the reason for the different behavior of AF and AAF adducts during DNA replication are not clear. We have begun to address these questions by attempting to understand the molecular interactions that occur between DNA polymerases and primer templates that position these adducts within the enzyme active site. In the experiments described here, we have measured the dissociation constants of the Klenow fragment from AAF- and AF-modified primer-template complexes where the adducts are positioned in or near the active site and in the presence or absence of each of the dNTPs. Measurement of equilibrium binding constants of DNA polymerases with DNA has been used extensively to study the mechanism of DNA polymerase action and the function of polymerase mutants. These constants are typically measured using single-turnover kinetics experiments (14Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The values that have been measured for wild-type Klenow fragment range from 0.2 to 8 nm, and prior measurements using the gel mobility assay in the absence of dNTP gave a value of 0.3 nm (23Astatke M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The present study, which used a slightly different DNA construct, gave a comparable value of 0.4 nm under otherwise similar conditions. No prior studies have measured dissociation constants in the presence of incorrect dNTPs because the kinetic method normally used to measure dissociation constants needs to have the correct nucleotide present. In the present study, measurements in the presence of each of the dNTPs was accomplished by the use of a primer-template containing a nonreactive 3′-dideoxynucleotide primer terminus. Under these experimental conditions, it was impossible for the dNTP to be incorporated, and the only possible fate of the complex was dissociation presumably because the rate of dissociation of the Klenow-DNA complex is much faster than the rate of shifting of the primer terminus to the exonuclease domain (15Kuchta R.D. Benkovic P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6716-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29Joyce C.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Also the absence of a 3′-OH did not effect the binding strength; in the absence of a dNTP the dissociation constants were identical for templates containing or lacking a 3′-OH (Table I). This result provides further evidence that the 3′-OH is not involved directly in the ground state DNA binding of the polymerase, consistent with the published crystal structures of polymerase-DNA complexes (8Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), (10Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Although Mg2+- mediated interactions between one of the active site carboxylates and the 3′-OH of the primer have been proposed, these must be too weak to be detected in this system or might be formed after the conversion to the closed conformation (see below). A great deal is known regarding the interactions of the polymerase with the primer-template (17Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). It is fairly well established that most DNA polymerases can adopt two different conformations during the process of nucleotide incorporation. These enzymes apparently bind to DNA in a so-called “open” conformation and then undergo a conformational change upon binding of a nucleotide (closed complex). This conformational rearrangement is thought to help bring the incoming nucleotide to the polymerase active site and align it properly for the nucleophilic attack by the 3′-hydroxyl of the primer. Unlike many other polymerases, DNA polymerase I apparently does not discriminate between the correct and incorrect dNTP at the time of nucleotide binding (24Eger B.T. Kuchta R.D. Carroll S.S. Benkovic P.A. Dahlberg M.E. Joyce C.M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1441-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Instead, checking for proper pairing is thought to take place during or after the conformational change that occurs when the polymerase adopts a closed structure. However, apparently all polymerases are able to reach a fully active catalytic configuration if the nucleotide can adopt a Watson-Crick geometry, and it is thought that this so-called induced fit mechanism provides the selectivity during nucleotide incorporation. Moreover, it has been shown for both the HIV reverse transcriptase (26Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the T7 DNA polymerase (17Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) that the rate of dissociation of the polymerase decreases when the polymerase is bound to a nucleotide and in the closed conformation and increases when the polymerase is bound to a nucleotide in the open conformation. Consistent with these, we find that positioning of a nonpairing nucleotide in the Klenow active site decreases the stability of the complex with DNA, whereas a correct nucleotide increases the stability (Table III). It is possible that the geometry of an incorrect dNTP bound to the active site does not allow the protein to complete the conformational change to the closed structure or that if the conformational change occurs, the structure is perturbed in the presence of a noncomplementary base. In either case the interactions between protein and the DNA are disturbed thereby decreasing the stability of the complex. The dissociation constants obtained when an AAF or AF adduct is positioned in the polymerase active site clearly indicate that their presence affect the interaction of the polymerase with both the template and incoming nucleotide. In the absence of a dNTP, the dissociation constant is about 5-fold lower when an AAF adduct is positioned in the active site, whereas an AF adduct has no effect on the binding (Table I). The enhanced binding was somewhat unexpected because the AAF adduct is known to cause a substantial distortion in the structure in the DNA helix (2Hoffmann G.R. Fuchs R.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and has been shown to inhibit strongly the incorporation across from the adduct by most polymerases (1Heflich R.H. Neft R.E. Mutat. Res. 1994; 318: 73-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the AAF adduct may drastically alter the structure of the primer-template within the active site which results in a complex having vastly different binding properties possibly involving specific interactions between the AAF moiety and amino acid side chains in the active site. In agreement with this model, a recently published footprinting analysis of the complex of T7 polymerase with AAF-modified primer-template (31Burnouf D.Y. Fuchs R.P. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) demonstrates that the presence of an AAF adduct reduces the hypersensitive sites seen in the footprint of unmodified DNA. It is important to note that a kinetic analysis has shown that the presence of an AAF adduct does not affect the dissociation rate for the T7 DNA polymerase (32Lindsley J.E. Fuchs R.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which may mean that our results are specific to polymerase I. A second important observation from this study is that this enhanced AAF-induced binding is not affected by the presence of a complementary or noncomplementary dNTP, whereas on an unmodified template the Watson-Crick nucleotide enhances binding, and the other nucleotides greatly reduce it (Table III). A recent molecular modeling study of DNA polymerase β bound to a primer-template modified with the bulky polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzo[a]pyrene, showed that the adduct may interact with the same amino acids that are involved into the nucleotide binding (33Singh S.B. Beard W.A. Hingerty B.E. Wilson S.H. Broyde S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 878-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is tempting to propose that the AAF adduct can also interfere with the nucleotide binding either sterically or by hydrogen bonding with one of the active site amino acids. Although no structural information has yet been published for an AAF adduct positioned at a primer-template junction, it has been shown that in some sequence contexts the dG-C8-AF adduct structure can resemble that determined for a dG-benzo[a]pyrene adduct (34Mao B. Gu Z. Gorin A. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14491-14501Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the AAF adduct can resemble a benzo[a]pyrene adduct at a primer-template junction where the benzo[a]pyrene adduct has been suggested to displace the modified guanine into the major groove and can stack over the junctional base pair (35Cosman M. Hingerty B.E. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15334-15350Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may be possible that the presence of the AAF adduct inhibits the conformational change that occurs upon nucleotide binding and removes any possible contribution that a nucleotide would have on the dissociation constants. Consistent with its ability to adopt two different conformations, the AF adduct produced a set of dissociation constants that had intermediate values between the unmodified and AAF-modified primer-templates when a noncomplementary nucleotide was present (TableIII). One possible explanation for this observation is that what was being measured is the average of two sets of data, one with the adducted guanine in the normal anti conformation and the other having the more distorted AAF-like syn conformation. We also note that the ternary complex is most stable in the presence of dCTP, which is in agreement with incorporation data showing that dCTP is most often incorporated across from an AF adduct (36Michaels M.L. Reid T.M. King C.M. Romano L.J. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Finally, no differences in the dissociation constants compared with the unmodified case are observed when either adduct is positioned at the +1 or +2 position on the primer-template (Table II). This result is consistent with the data from a recent study by Miller and Grollman (37Miller H. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15336-15342Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that kinetic parameters for nucleotide incorporation are not influenced by an adduct positioned away from the primer-template junction (37Miller H. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15336-15342Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, whatever interactions are causing the AAF-induced enhanced binding they are not simply a nonspecific interaction of the adduct with the hydrophobic amino acids and are most probably related to the mechanism of polymerization in the active site. This is supported further by the differences observed between the AAF and AF adduct, which are chemically very similar but lead to very different behaviors when positioned in the active site. A full understanding of these interactions awaits a crystal structure of a DNA polymerase complexed with a primer-template containing an AAF and AF adduct."

The coordination between these reactions was studied using mutants of yeast topoisomerase II that are unable to covalently cleave DNA. In the absence of DNA, the ATPase activities of these mutant enzymes are identical to the wild type activity. DNA binding stimulates the ATPase activity of the mutant enzymes, but with steady-state parameters different from those of the wild type enzyme. These differences were examined through DNA binding experiments and pre-steady-state ATPase assays. One mutant protein, Y782F, binds DNA with the same affinity as wild type protein. This mutant topologically traps one DNA circle in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog under the same conditions that the wild type protein catenates two circles. Rapid chemical quench and pulse-chase ATPase experiments reveal that the mutant proteins bound to DNA have the same sequential hydrolysis reaction cycle as the wild type enzyme. Binding of ATP to the mutants is not notably impaired, but hydrolysis of the first ATP is slower than for the wild type enzyme.

Type II DNA topoisomerases catalyze the ATP-dependent transport of one duplex DNA segment through a transient break in another (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Berger J.M. Wang J.C. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1994; 77: 955-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Additionally, due to their ability to change DNA topology, these enzymes exert a global influence on DNA metabolism (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). Clinically these enzymes are of interest because they are targets of a diverse group of anticancer and antibiotic drugs (5Liu L.F.

Type II topoisomerases catalyze two types of chemical reactions: ATP hydrolysis and DNA breakage/religation. These are large homodimeric enzymes with an ATPase domain at the amino terminus of each monomer. Several types of experiments have indicated that when ATP binds, the ATPase domains dimerize (8Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 9Ali J.A. Orphanides G. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9801-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis is thought to occur by the direct in-line attack of an activated water molecule on the γ-phosphate of ATP (10Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The steady-state ATPase rates of enzymes purified from several organisms are DNA-stimulated (11Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Halligan B.D. Edwards K.A. Liu L.F. J. Biol.

Pre-steady-state ATPase experiments show a rapid burst in ATP hydrolysis, but only when the topoisomerase is bound to DNA (14Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results indicate that DNA binding stimulates the rate of ATP binding and/or the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Analysis of pH rate profiles suggests that binding of DNA primarily stimulates ATP binding (15Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Additionally, the pre-steady-state results, in conjunction with results of inhibitor studies, show that although the topoisomerase binds two ATPs, it hydrolyzes only one rapidly (15Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Following the first hydrolysis, the enzyme apparently releases the Pi and ADP produced before hydrolyzing the second ATP. The second chemical reaction, double strand DNA breakage, is catalyzed by the nucleophilic attack from the hydroxyl groups of two active site tyrosines, one in each monomer, on a staggered pair of phosphodiester bonds in the DNA (reviewed in Ref. 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). This attack results in the transient covalent attachment of each monomer to the 5′-end of one strand of DNA. Religation of the DNA occurs by essentially the reverse reaction in which the 3′-OH ends of DNA attack the pair of phosphotyrosyl linkages. The equilibrium between DNA cleavage and religation in a topoisomerase II-DNA complex normally lies strongly toward religation (16Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This equilibrium is somewhat perturbed by ATP binding (17Sugino A. Higgins N.P. Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 18Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is strongly perturbed by the presence of anticancer drugs, such as etoposide, amsacrine, and mitoxantrone (5Liu L.F.

However, in order to understand how the enzyme can transport one segment of DNA (termed the transported (T) 1The abbreviations used are: T segment, transported segment; G segment, gated segment; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; CBD, chitin binding domain; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: T segment, transported segment; G segment, gated segment; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; CBD, chitin binding domain; bp, base pair(s). segment) through a protein-mediated gate in another segment (termed the gated (G) segment) while using the energy available from ATP binding and hydrolysis, it is essential to understand how these two reactions are coordinated. In the present study, we begin to probe the interactions between the ATPase and DNA breakage reactions. Without the hydroxyl group of the active site tyrosine, the topoisomerase cannot cleave DNA through covalent attachment. Without covalent attachment to the G segment of DNA, the topoisomerase cannot undergo the conformational changes normally associated with opening of the gate without first breaking its noncovalent DNA binding interactions. To study how the inability to cleave DNA and related disturbances in protein conformational changes affect the ATPase reaction cycle, the active site tyrosine, amino acid 782 in the S. cerevisiaeenzyme, 2The numbering of amino acids in the S. cerevisiae TOP2 gene product has been corrected (19Liu Q.

The DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of this mutant is shown to differ from the wild type activity. The difference in steady-state ATPase rates for the mutant and wild type enzyme could be due to differences in DNA binding, the rates of ATP binding/dissociation, the rates of ATP hydrolysis/synthesis, or the rates of ADP/Pi dissociation. To interpret how these differences in ATPase rate may provide clues to the overall topoisomerase II mechanism, it is necessary to understand precisely which of these parameters is affected. DNA binding and pre-steady-state ATPase experiments are described that help to define the differences between the wild type and mutant enzymes. To ensure that this perturbation in ATPase activity is solely due to a lack in DNA breakage ability by this mutant enzyme, and not some unrelated consequence of mutation, a second DNA cleavage mutant (19Liu Q. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20252-20260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) is also studied. Standard reagents were purchased from the following commercial resources: ATP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), NEN Life Science Products; 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate, AMPPNP, and ultra-pure HEPES, Boehringer Mannheim; NADH, phospho(enol)pyruvate (trisodium salt hydrate), and pyruvate kinase (700 units/ml)/lactate dehydrogenase (100 units/ml) mixture from rabbit muscle, Sigma. All buffers were filtered (0.45 μm). The sheared salmon sperm DNA used for ATPase assays was prepared as described previously (14Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A new method of topoisomerase II purification based on the IMPACT system (New England Biolabs) was used for these studies. The expression plasmid used for the wild type enzyme, pJEL236, is essentially YEpTOP2-PGAL1 (20Giaever G.N. Snyder L. Wang J.C. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 29: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with the insertion of the sequences coding for the modified intein and chitin binding domains (intein/CBD) from pCYB2 (New England Biolabs) just prior to the stop codon. This vector expresses a fusion of yeast topoisomerase II with the intein/CBD that allows for rapid purification. The constructs were made using polymerase chain reactions that replaced the final aspartic acid codon and stop codon of the TOP2gene with a unique blunt cutting Ecl136II restriction site that could be ligated to a SmaI site at the 5′-end of the intein/CBD coding sequences. The construct was designed such that the only difference between wild type S. cerevisiae topoisomerase II and the final purified wild type topoisomerase is that the final aspartic acid has been changed to glycine. The purified protein with this one change has identical biochemical characteristics to the fully wild type enzyme, and for the purposes of these studies, it will be referred to as wild type topoisomerase II. The expression plasmid (pSKM1) for the mutant in which the active site tyrosine has been changed to phenylalanine, Y782F, was made from plasmid YEpTOP2-PGAL1-Y782F (a kind gift of Brian Davis, United States Department of Agriculture). The topoisomerase II coding sequence was verified by sequencing, which showed that the only alteration was a change from TAT to TTT at codon 782. The intein/CBD coding sequences were then inserted into this plasmid to make pSKM1 as described above for the wild type expression plasmid. The expression plasmid for the mutant R690A fused to the intein/CBD was derived from the plasmid pSW201-R690A (a kind gift of Qiyong Liu and James C. Wang, Harvard University). pSW201-R690A was cut with KpnI andAvrII, and the fragment encoding the mutated portion of topoisomerase II was swapped with the similar fragment from YEpTOP2-PGAL1 to make pSKM2. The final expression plasmid (pSKM3) was made by inserting the intein/CBD sequences as above. Both of the final purified mutant proteins, Y782F and R690A, also have the final aspartic acid replaced by glycine. The enzyme-intein/CBD fusions were expressed to very high levels from the plasmids pJEL236, pSKM1, and pSKM3 in the yeast strain BCY123 as described previously for the wild type enzyme (21Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6107-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The basic buffer used throughout purification, Buffer I, contained 50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 10% glycerol. The cells (36 g) were washed and cracked as described previously (22Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cracked cells were diluted to 200 ml with load buffer (Buffer I + 500 mm KCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 150 μg/ml benzamidine) and centrifuged for 30 min at 45,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a 50-ml (5 cm in diameter) chitin bead (New England Biolabs) column by gravity. The column was washed with 5 volumes of load buffer at 2 ml/min followed by 10 volumes of wash buffer (Buffer I + 1 m KCl + 0.1% Triton X-100) at 3 ml/min. Cleavage of the intein/CBD from topoisomerase II was induced by washing the column with four volumes of Buffer I + 500 mm KCl + 30 mm dithiothreitol. The released topoisomerase II was eluted 12 h later. The eluant was diluted 2× in Buffer I prior to loading onto a phosphocellulose column equilibrated with Buffer I + 150 mm KCl. The size of the phosphocellulose column was determined by the amount of protein eluted from the chitin column; 1 ml of phosphocellulose was used for each 3 mg of protein. The column was washed with three volumes of Buffer I + 300 mm KCl, and the topoisomerase II was eluted with a minimal volume of Buffer I + 1 m KCl. The peak fractions were combined, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. For DNA binding studies, the protein was dialyzed extensively in Buffer I + 250 mm KCl prior to freezing. This method provided 45 mg of highly purified wild type or 15 mg of mutant topoisomerase II from 12 liters of cell growth. These large quantities of protein were required because 15–20 mg of enzyme is needed for each pre-steady-state ATPase assay. A coupled assay using pyruvate kinase, phospho(enol)pyruvate, lactate dehydrogenase, and NADH was used as described previously (13Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 30 °C in ATPase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KOAc, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2) at 10 different ATP concentrations (25 μm to 1 mm). Purified and sheared salmon sperm DNA was used at a ratio of 200 bp/enzyme dimer; this DNA was shown to stimulate the ATPase identically to supercoiled plasmid DNA (14Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II binds ATP with positive cooperativity, as revealed by Michaelis-Menten plots with slight sigmoidal character at the lowest ATP concentrations. However, in the present analysis, this cooperativity was ignored and the data were fit to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation as follows using KaleidaGraph 3.0. υ0=[E]0[S]kcatKm+[S]Equation 1 The binding affinities of wild type and Y782F topoisomerase II for DNA were measured using a double-filter method developed by Wong and Lohman (23Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The DNA used was a32P-labeled 46-mer duplex, similar in sequence to oligonucleotides used previously for DNA binding and cleavage studies with type II topoisomerases isolated from various organisms (24Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Alsner J. Sorensen H.V. Schmidt V.K. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The substrate was made by annealing complementary 43-mer oligonucleotides (5′-GGGTGAAATCTAACAATGCGCTCATCGTCATCCTCGGCACCGT and 5′-GGGACGGTGCCGAGGATGACGATGAGCGCATTGTTAGATTTCA) such that the duplex had a 3-guanine overhang on each 5′-end. Equal concentrations of the oligonucleotides (final concentration, 41 μm) were mixed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm LiCl2, heated to 96 °C, and allowed to cool to room temperature over 4 h. The overhangs were filled in with Klenow fragment, 100 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 200 μm each of dTTP, dGTP, and dATP. After 15 min, the reaction was chased with 200 μm unlabeled dCTP for 1 min. The substrate was purified away from free nucleotides using a Chroma spin TE-10 column (CLONTECH). Following phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the substrate was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and its concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm (ε260 = 6.16 × 105m−1 cm−1). The double-filter method employed uses a nitrocellulose membrane to trap labeled DNA bound to protein on top of a DEAE membrane that traps free DNA (23Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This method allows one to measure both protein-bound DNA and free DNA counts, improving precision and accuracy over conventional binding methods. We used the same membranes, prepared in the same fashion, and a similarly altered dot blot apparatus, as described previously (23Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II and the labeled DNA substrate were mixed at room temperature such that the final DNA concentration was 2 nm and the final enzyme dimer concentration ranged from 0.5 to 400 nm. The reactions performed in the absence of Mg2+ also contained 85 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5–7% glycerol, and 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reactions that contained 5 mmMgCl2 were similar except that the KCl concentration was lowered to 45–60 mm to maintain a similar overall ionic strength between experiments. Using the optimal ATPase reaction buffer including 150 mm KCl, the maximum percentage of DNA bound was only 10–20% (not shown). The concentrations of KCl were therefore dropped to those listed above to achieve binding near 100% for accurate determination of K d values. The slight range in glycerol and KCl concentrations was inevitable due to the different amounts of enzyme added to the binding reactions. The binding reactions were allowed to equilibrate for 10–30 min at room temperature prior to filtration through the nitrocellulose and DEAE membranes at 6 ml/min. Aliquots (25 μl) of each reaction were filtered in triplicate and rinsed with 150 μl of cold binding buffer. DNA counts on the dried membranes were determined at each spot by phosphorimage analysis (Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager TM model 400 with ImageQuant (version 3.3) software). Control reactions lacking topoisomerase were also filtered as described to determine the nonspecific DNA counts trapped by the nitrocellulose. For each binding reaction, the ratio of bound to total DNA was determined as indicated below and plotted versus the topoisomerase II concentration. [DNA]bound[DNA]total=(counts on nitrocellulose)−(nonspecific nitrocellulose counts)(counts on nitrocellulose)+(counts on DEAE)Equation 2 The data were fit to the binding mechanism, T+D⇋KdTDEquation 3 where T represents the topoisomerase II dimer, D represents the duplex DNA oligomer, and K d represents the equilibrium dissociation constant. The values for K dwere determined by fitting the data to the equation describing this mechanism, [DNA]bound[DNA]total=[T]CKd+[T]Equation 4 where C is a constant that approaches 1 as the asymptote approaches 1, using KaleidaGraph 3.0. The technique used is essentially that described previously (26Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reactions of 30 μl containing 150 nm topoisomerase II dimer, 250 nm relaxed or linearized pBluescript plasmid DNA (3 kilobase pairs), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm KOAc, and 8 mm Mg(OAc)2 were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. AMPPNP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued an additional 30 min. To an aliquot of 20 μl of each reaction, 130 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm KOAc, and 8 mm Mg(OAc)2) and 334 μl of saturated CsCl were added. These samples were spun at 40,000 rpm in an analytical ultracentrifuge (XL-A ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments) with scans at 260 and 280 nm taken at 36 and 40 h. Data plots were made using Microcal Origin 3.78. Rapid chemical quench and pulse-chase experiments were performed as described previously (14Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) using the KinTek Model RQF-3 rapid quench apparatus (27Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 677-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, topoisomerase II bound to DNA was rapidly mixed with [α-32P]ATP (0.01 μCi/μl) in ATPase reaction buffer. The final topoisomerase II dimer concentration in the reactions ranged from 5.5 to 7.5 μm (see legends to Figs. 3 and 4), whereas the DNA concentration was kept at a constant ratio of 200:1 base pairs:enzyme dimer. The final labeled ATP concentration was typically 350 μm, a concentration previously shown to essentially saturate the ATP active sites while still providing a good signal to noise ratio (14Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The enzyme and substrate were allowed to react for 20 ms to 1.5 s. For chemical quench experiments, the reaction was rapidly quenched by addition of 250 mm EDTA in 100 mm Tris base (pH 10) at the indicated time points. SDS (final concentration, 1%) was present in the sample collection tubes to ensure that no residual enzyme activity persisted. For pulse-chase experiments, 10.6 mm unlabeled ATP was mixed with the reaction at the indicated time points. After sufficient time for multiple enzyme turnovers, 1.5 s for the wild type enzyme and 3 s for the mutant enzymes, the reactions were chemically quenched as indicated above. The concentrations of [α-32P]ADP produced at each time point were determined in quintuplicate as described previously (14Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The data were all fit to a single exponential equation with a linear term called the burst equation,A(1 − e −Bt) + Ct, using KaleidaGraph 3.0. The value A is the burst amplitude,B is the burst rate constant, and C is the steady-state term.Figure 4Pre-steady-state ATPase analysis of R690A topoisomerase II. Chemical quench (•) and pulse-chase (○) time courses were performed with R690A mutant topoisomerase II at final concentrations of 5.5 μm enzyme dimer, 1.5 mmDNA bp, and 350 μm ATP. The data were fit as described under “Experimental Procedures” with values for the chemical quench reaction of A = 4.0 ± 0.6 μm,B = 9 ± 3 s−1, and C= 10 ± 1 μm s−1, and for the pulse-chase reaction of A = 10 ± 1 μm, B = 60 ± 15 s−1, and C = 9 ± 1 μms−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a first step to understanding the relationship between ATP hydrolysis and DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, steady-state ATPase parameters were determined for wild type and Y782F enzymes. This mutant cannot cleave DNA through covalent attachment because it lacks the active site hydroxyl nucleophiles that normally would attack a pair of staggered 5′ phosphates. The results of the steady-state ATPase assays are given in Table I. Although the results shown are from a single set of experiments, the same relative values have been found a minimum of four times using four different sets of protein preparations. In the absence of DNA, k cat andk cat/K m values are identical for the wild type and mutant enzymes. This is expected if the mutation only affects interactions with DNA. It has been previously shown for several type II topoisomerases that DNA stimulates the steady-state ATPase rates (11Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Halligan B.D. Edwards K.A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2475-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study is in agreement and shows that when either the wild type or mutant enzyme is bound to DNA,k cat andk cat/K m values increase. Whereask cat/K m values increase to the same extent for the two proteins, the k cat value for Y782F is reproducibly 4-fold lower than that for wild type. Results of previous studies indicate thatk cat/K m for the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by topoisomerase II essentially includes only rate constants involved in ATP binding, whereas k cat reflects the rate-determining steps (15Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These present data are consistent with the Y782F mutant enzyme-DNA complex binding ATP in a similar fashion to wild type-DNA complex. However, why is the k cat of ATP hydrolysis lower for a mutant that cannot covalently cleave DNA? The following experiments were performed to address this question.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for ATP hydrolysis by wild type and mutant type II DNA topoisomerasesReactionaReactions were performed and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”k cat(k cat/K m)s−1m−1 s−1Wild type − DNA0.58.3 × 102Wild type + DNA5.32.7 × 104Y782F − DNA0.58.3 × 102Y782F + DNA1.32.6 × 104R690A − DNA0.58.3 × 102R690A + DNA2.32.6 × 104a Reactions were performed and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Because topoisomerase II is a DNA-stimulated ATPase, any perturbation in DNA binding could affect the ATPase activity of the enzyme. Therefore, to determine whether the decreasedk cat value for the Y782F protein is due to altered noncovalent interactions with DNA, DNA binding studies were performed. A double-filter binding method (23Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) was used to measure the affinity of wild type and Y782F enzymes for a 46-bp duplex oligonucleotide substrate. Wild type topoisomerase II requires a divalent cation for covalent attachment to DNA. To ensure that only noncovalent interactions were being measured in the first binding experiment, reaction and wash buffers lacked Mg2+. The results of these binding studies are shown in Fig.1 A. The data fit well to an equation describing a single DNA molecule binding per enzyme dimer, with K d values of 29 nm for both wild type and Y782F mutant enzymes. The presence of Mg2+ not only allows the wild type enzyme to covalently cleave DNA but may affect important noncovalent interactions as well. Therefore, the binding experiments were repeated in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2(Fig. 1 B). In the presence of Mg2+, both enzymes bound DNA more tightly than in its absence, with K dvalues of 11 nm for both wild type and Y782F. Again, the enzymes bound DNA with equal affinities, even though under these conditions, the wild type can covalently attach to the DNA. These results are in agreement with many previous results indicating that the DNA cleavage-religation equilibrium for topoisomerase II strongly favors religation (16Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II can topologically trap circular DNA if it subsequently"

In the present study, we report the presence of a silencer region in the human ANT2 promoter and the purification of a two-component factor that recognizes a specific hexanucleotide element, GTCCTG, of the silencer. Transfection of deletion constructs shows that ANT2 silencer activity extends over a region of at least 310 nts. However, mutating the GTCCTG element completely relieves silencing activity in the context of the human ANT2 promoter. The data suggest that the GTCCTG element might be required for maintaining silencer activity of the extended silencer region. The ANT2 silencer region cloned in front of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter confers nearly complete inhibition to the heterologous promoter. However, unlike the ANT2 promoter, mutating the GTCCTG element restores only partial activity to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. A protein complex consisting of two major polypeptides of 37 and 49 kDa was isolated from HeLa nuclear extracts by affinity chromatography using the GTCCTG element as the affinity resin. Cross-linking studies and Southwestern analysis indicate that p37 binds DNA. p49 appears to be loosely associated with the p37/DNA complex but is necessary for strong binding of p37.

ANT2 expression is low in quiescent cells and is substantially increased by factors that induce entrance into G1 and subsequent cell growth (11Battini R. Ferrari S. Kaczmarek L. Calabretta B.

The physiological significance of expression of just the ANT2 isoform in a growth-dependent manner has not been delineated, although it is possible that slight kinetic differences in ADP/ATP exchange catalyzed by the isoforms (13Klingenberg M. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 56: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) might provide the growth-activated cell with an energetic advantage.

Nelson, unpublished observations. cells. A second negative acting region was also identified in the distal region of the ANT2 promoter (14Li R. Hodny Z. Luciakova K. Baráth P. Nelson B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18925-18930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have characterized this region. We show that the negative acting element is a unique silencer region that is distributed over a region of about 300 nts, but whose silencer function is directed from an element containing a GTCCTG core sequence. We also report the purification of a two-component factor that binds to this element and appears to be responsible for maintaining silencer function. HeLa cells were grown to subconfluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells (4 × 105) were plated on 60-mm Petri dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate method (15Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) using 5–8 μg of reporter plasmid DNA containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and 2–5 μg of control plasmid DNA (RSV-LacZ or pLuc-ANT2(−235/+46)). Enzymatic activities (CAT, β-galactosidase, and luciferase) were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (16.Promega (1991) Promega Protocol and Application Guide 2nd Ed., Madison, WI.Google Scholar). Preparation of pCAT-ANT2(−647/+46) and pCAT-ANT2(−235/+46) was described previously (14Li R. Hodny Z. Luciakova K. Baráth P. Nelson B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18925-18930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To construct pCAT-ANT2(−546/+46) and pCAT-ANT2(−413/+46), corresponding ANT2 promoter fragments prepared by restriction enzyme digestion (BamHI/PstI and DraI/PstI, respectively) were cloned into pCATbasic (Promega). pCAT-ANT2(−647/+46)mut was constructed by the overlap-extension polymerase chain reaction (17$$Google Scholar). A mutated (CC to AA) oligonucleotide covering nts −338 to −318 (5′-CCTAGTAATGGTAATGCTCC-3′) of the ANT2 promoter was synthesized and used as a primer for introducing the mutation into the −647/+46 fragment. The M13 (nts 2230–2208) and CAT (nts 2307–2285) primers of pCATbasic were also used. All other deletion clones containing mutated oligonucleotide −338/−318 were constructed by restriction deletion of pCAT-ANT2(−647/+46)mut. pCAT-ANT2(−546/−235)wt and pCAT-ANT2(−546/−235)mut, which were used as templates for the polymerase chain reaction to synthesize DNase I footprint probes, were created by removing theSmaI/PstI −235/+46 fragment from pCAT-ANT2(−546/+46)wt or pCAT-ANT2(−546/+46)mut, respectively, followed by T4 DNA polymerase blunting and plasmid re-ligation. All clones were checked by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. Heterologous promoter constructs of the ANT2 silencer region and the HSVtk promoter were prepared by cloning ANT2 promoter restriction fragments into the pBLCAT2 (18Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) polylinker. The clones were checked for correct orientation by restriction enzyme digestion, and the presence of mutation within the −338/−318 element was confirmed by sequencing. HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were grown to subconfluence in 175-cm2 flasks. Cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (19Lee K.A. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Rat liver nuclei purified as described previously (20Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Madeleine Kihlmark (Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden), and nuclear proteins were extracted in high salt C buffer as described previously (19Lee K.A. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The protein was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were stored in 20-μl aliquots at −70 °C. EMSA reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 20 mm K+-Hepes (pH 7.9), 70 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 8 μmZnCl2, 1.5 μg of nuclear extract, 250 ng of poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC) (Pharmacia), and competitor DNA (where indicated) was incubated on ice for 10 min. Radioactively labeled oligonucleotide probe (10,000 cpm) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Bound complexes were separated on 5% native acrylamide gels in 0. 5× TBE (1× TBE = 90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The gels were dried and autoradiographed. DNase I protection was performed as described previously (16.Promega (1991) Promega Protocol and Application Guide 2nd Ed., Madison, WI.Google Scholar). Radioactive probes were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using 5′ 32P-labeled CAT primer, M13 primer, and pCAT-ANT2(−546/−235)wt or pCAT-ANT2(−546/−235)mut as the templates. The probe (20,000 cpm) was partially digested by RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence or absence of HeLa nuclear extract (20 μg) and separated on a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel. Radioactive oligonucleotide probes (ANT2 −338/−318wt or ANT2 −338/−318mut) were incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts under the exact conditions described above for the EMSA. Samples were placed 5 cm from a UV Transluminator (Ultra-Violet Products, Inc.) and exposed to UV light for 10, 20, or 30 min. Subsequent DNase I/micrococcal nuclease treatment (17$$Google Scholar) was omitted due to the 5′ end-labeling of the probes. Cross-linked complexes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed. For Southwestern analysis, increasing amounts of HeLa nuclear extract (10, 25, and 50 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were treated with guanidinium hydrochloride and incubated with radioactively labeled oligonucleotides as described previously (21Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from 1.5 × 109 HeLa cells were purified (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and separated on Sephadex G-100 SF column (Pharmacia) in a buffer containing 20 mmHepes (pH 7.9) and 400 mm KCl. Eluted fractions were tested for protein binding to the ANT2 −338/−318 oligonucleotide by EMSA. Active fractions were pooled and adjusted to 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. To remove nonspecific DNA binding proteins, the protein sample was repeatedly incubated (1 h, 4 °C) with mutated ANT2 −338/−318 oligonucleotide coupled to CNBr Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) (23Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The flow-through was collected and incubated (1 h, 4 °C) with 100 μl of immobilized streptavidin (Boehringer Mannheim) to remove streptavidin-binding proteins. Biotinylated ANT2 −338/−318 oligonucleotide probe (850 pmol) was added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Fresh streptavidin resin (100 μl) was added, and the incubation was repeated. The resins with bound DNA and proteins were collected, washed in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 m NaCl, and eluted stepwise with the same buffer containing increasing concentrations (0.1–1.0 m) of NaCl. Finally, streptavidin resins were washed with 100 μl of 0.1 m glycin (pH 2.5). We previously identified a region of the human ANT2 promoter between nts −647 and −235 (14Li R. Hodny Z. Luciakova K. Baráth P. Nelson B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18925-18930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that exhibited negative regulation in three different transfected cell lines (JEG3, NIH3T3, and HeLa), suggesting the involvement of a factor(s) common to all of the cell lines tested. To further define this region of the ANT2 promoter, additional 5′ deletion clones were constructed and tested in transient transfection experiments using HeLa cells (Fig.1). Deletion of nts −647 to −546 had no significant influence on the promoter activity. By contrast, the stepwise deletion of nts −546 to −413 and nts −413 to −235 each resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in ANT2 promoter activity. Thus, negative regulation is spread over an extended area of about 310 nts (nts −546 to −235). To emphasize the bipartite distribution of the negative acting region (Fig. 1), we shall refer to fragment −546/−413 and fragment −412/−235 as silencer regions A and B, respectively. Together, the A and B regions decrease ANT2 promoter activity by 70–75%. Protein binding sites on the silencer region were determined by DNase I protection using ANT2 −546/−235 as the probe and HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig.2 A). This probe includes both the A and B silencer regions. However, DNase I-protected sites were found only in the B region (nts −413/−235). The most strongly protected area covers nucleotides −339 to −310 (region 2, Fig.2 A). The core sequence of this site consists of a hexanucleotide direct repeat (GTCCTG) with no spacing (Fig.2 B). Two additional weakly protected regions are located upstream and downstream from region 2. Region 1 is weakly protected over a 14-nt sequence that contains a nuclear receptor half-site (AGGTCA) on the noncoding strand. Region 3, which is located upstream from region 2, covers a 27-nt-long sequence and includes strong DNase I-hypersensitive sites. With the exception of a very weak correlation to the NF1 element, no conserved transfactor binding elements could be identified in region 3 by computer analysis (24Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Strong protection of region 2 suggests that the binding protein is present in high amounts in HeLa nuclear extracts, or that it binds with high affinity. Consistent with this conclusion, weak protection of the major Sp1-activating sites within the proximal promoter requires three times more HeLa nuclear extract (data not shown) than used here for the protection of silencer region 2. To further study protein binding to region 2, a wild type oligonucleotide covering the central part of region 2 (nts −338 to −318) and a mutated oligonucleotide (CC to AA; Fig. 2 B) of the same region were used in EMSA. Competition experiments showed that binding to the wild type probe was nearly eliminated by a 5-fold molar excess of the unlabeled probe but was unaffected by a 50-fold excess of the mutated probe (Fig.3 A). In addition, no binding was observed when the mutated oligonucleotide served as the EMSA probe (data not shown). The region 2-binding protein is also present in mouse NIH3T3 cells and rat liver. Nuclear extracts from both sources exhibit specific binding to the wild type probe (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the silencer protein appears to be widely expressed in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, three sites on the B silencer region are contacted by nuclear extract components. To determine whether region 2 influences binding to the weaker sites, the mutated region 2 sequence was placed in the context of the long promoter fragment (−546/−235). This construct was subjected to DNase I protection analysis with HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 3 C). As expected, protection of the mutated region 2 site is abolished, and, in addition, the hypersensitive bands that surround it are lost. However, protection of regions 1 and 3 is not significantly affected by a mutation in region 2, suggesting that protein binds to these sites independent of region 2. To determine whether the strongly protected region 2 could influence silencer activity, deletion clones bearing the mutated GTCCTG element were constructed and fused with the CAT gene. Promoter activities of these clones and the corresponding wild type clones were measured in transient transfection experiments (Fig.4). Normalized CAT activity was increased up to 3.7-fold in the mutated clones, and, in the case of mutated fragments −546/+46 and −413/+46, promoter activity was restored to levels comparable to those obtained with clones in which the A and B silencer regions were deleted (clone −235/+46, Fig. 1). This observation indicates that the mutation in the GTCCTG element region 2 is able to eliminate silencing from the distal A suppressor region (nts −546/−413). Thus, the silencer protein appears to play a central role in organizing or maintaining the entire silencer region. Fig. 5 A shows that silencing could be conferred to the heterologous HSVtk promoter in transfected HeLa cells. Silencing function was retained in the −413/−235 ANT2 promoter fragment that includes the GTCCTG element. Interestingly, silencing of the thymidine kinase promoter reached 87–95%, which was higher than that observed in 5′ deletion experiments with the native ANT2 promoter. As a control, the region immediately upstream of the ANT2 silencer (nts −647/−546) that lacks the GTCCTG element was also cloned in front of the thymidine kinase promoter and transfected into HeLa cells. This fragment exhibited no silencer properties (Fig. 5 A). Mutated GTCCTG elements partially relieved the silencing of the heterologous ANT2-thymidine kinase promoter (Fig. 5 B), but unlike the native ANT2 promoter, full restoration was not achieved.** A computer search of a vertebrate transfactor database (24Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) failed to reveal a transfactor that specifically recognizes the region 2 sequence. To estimate the size of the protein binding to this DNA sequence, both cross-linking and Southwestern blot analysis were performed. Using HeLa nuclear extracts, a single polypeptide with an apparent mass of 33 kDa is cross-linked to the wild type ANT2 −338/−318 probe, but not to the mutated probe (Fig.6 A). No other specific signals were detected, even under prolonged UV light exposure (data not shown). Southwestern blot analysis with wild type ANT2 −338/−318 oligonucleotide as the probe also identified a single band that did not hybridize with the mutated probe (Fig. 6 B). The apparent mass of this polypeptide was 37.9 kDa. Because the mobility of cross-linked polypeptides can be affected by a covalently attached DNA probe, we conclude that the molecular mass of the DNA-binding protein is most likely around 38 kDa. This is confirmed by an analysis of the purified factor (see below). The presence of a single cross-linked band on SDS gels (Fig.6 A) suggests that the DNA-binding protein binds as a monomer, although the symmetric organization of the GTCCTG element is suggestive of a dimer binding site. However, we could not eliminate the possibility that the DNA-binding protein interacts with additional factors, because protein cross-linkers were not used in our experiments. The DNA sequence of region 2 (noncoding strand, 5′-CAGGACCAGGAC-3′) resembles a general binding site for the family of Ets proteins (5′-C/AGGAA/T-3′; Ref.25Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). However, antibodies against the conserved region of human Ets-1 protein (amino acids 362–374) failed to recognize the DNA-binding protein in an EMSA supershift assay (data not shown). This antibody (catalogue number sc-112X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) cross-reacts with several members of the Ets family. A protein that binds specifically to the GTCCTG element was purified from HeLa nuclear extracts by DNA affinity chromatography using a biotin-labeled region 2 oligonucleotide (ANT2 −338/−318) as the affinity ligand (Fig.7 A). The fraction from which protein was purified by the affinity chromatography step (Fig.7 A) had previously been treated with a DNA resin containing the region 2 oligonucleotide bearing a mutated GTCCTG element. Thus, the protein purified in Fig. 7 A binds specifically to the wild type GTCCTG element. Fig. 7 A also shows that the polypeptides were not retained on immobilized streptavidin in the absence of the ANT2 −338/−318 oligonucleotide ligand. Together, the above experiments show that the purified polypeptides associate specifically with the region 2 GTCCTG element. The affinity-purified fraction contained two major polypeptides with molecular masses of 49 and 37 kDa that co-eluted from the affinity resin between 0.2 and 0.4 m NaCl (Fig. 7 A). Only residual binding of these polypeptides was observed to columns containing the mutated oligonucleotide ligand (data not shown). The apparent mass of the smaller polypeptide is identical to that of the DNA-binding protein identified with Southwestern blot analysis and agrees well with that observed by cross-linking. Based on these criteria, we conclude that p37 most probably binds DNA. Although p49 appears to co-elute with p37 in Fig. 7 A, in other experiments, proportionately more p49 is eluted at lower salt concentrations (0.2 m), suggesting that the p49 association with the p37/DNA complex is weaker than the p37/DNA contact itself. The functional integrity of the DNA affinity-purified protein was tested by EMSA using the ANT2 −338/−318 wt oligonucleotide (see above) as the probe (Fig. 7 B). Fractions eluted from the affinity resin with 0.2 or 0.4 m salt containing both p37 and p49 gave a single, strongly shifted band identical to that obtained with crude nuclear extracts. Thus, the isolated fraction appears to be fully active. However, the formation of a strong DNA complex appears to require both p37 and p49, because a bandshift was obtained with fractions eluting at 0.2 and 0.4 m NaCl that contain roughly similar amounts of p37 and p49, but not with the 0.6m fraction that includes little p49. In the present study, we describe a silencer region within the human ANT2 promoter and report the purification of factors that are essential to silencing. The silencer region extends over 310 nts (nts −546 to −235) and was divided by the transfection of deletion constructs into two regions, which were designated A and B. DNase I-protected sites are restricted to the B region, but both regions are required for complete silencing. Silencing by the A and B regions appears to be additive rather than synergistic. The combined A and B regions completely suppress the activity of the heterologous HSVtk promoter, showing that it functions as a general, position-independent silencer (26Ogbourne S. Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although both the A and B regions are required for maximal silencing of transcription, the B region, and more specifically, one element within the B region, is required for the expression of the A region's silencing capacity. This element, encompassing 29 nts with a central, directly repeated hexanucleotide, 5′-GTCCTG-3′, is the most strongly protected DNase I site within the B region. The central role of the hexanucleotide repeat is clearly shown by the finding that the mutated form (GTCCTG to GTAATG) abolishes silencer function. The GTCCTG element thus appears to organize the entire silencer region in a manner that is not yet understood. Indeed, the role of the A region remains an enigma. It is possible that specific suppressor proteins that are not detected by our methods bind to region A. If present, however, their association with DNA would probably be controlled by protein binding to the GTCCTG element. A second explanation might be that the silencer region includes a nucleosome assembly site. The A region contains putative AT tracts that are important in nucleosome assembly (27Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 28Satchwell S.C. Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 659-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Nucleosome assembly is strongly influenced by specific DNA-binding proteins, including hormone receptors. Thyroid hormone and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor were reported to disrupt chromatin structure and facilitate transcriptional repression in the absence of hormone by a mechanism that does not involve deacetylases (29Wong J. Patterton D. Imhol A. Guschin D. Shi Y.-B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 520-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Region B of the ANT2 silencer is footprinted over a conserved hormone response element half site (AGGTCA), but this footprint is not altered by mutating the GTCCTG element that prevents silencing. Whatever the mechanisms of suppression through the A + B silencer region, it is clear that the factor binding to the GTCCTG element is of central importance. A search of the eucaryotic promoter data base (GenBank) shows that hexanucleotide repeat (GTCCTGGTCCTG) is rarely found in mammalian promoters. By contrast, the hexanucleotide (GTCCTG) is present in a large number of promoters. In most cases, it appears to be part of an enhancing or activating element (30Beaupain D. Eleouet J.F. Romeo P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6509-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Haun R.S. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 8775-8781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in glutathione transferase P (34Imagawa M. Osada S. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), apolipoprotein AI (35Paulweber B. Brooks A.R. Nagy B.P. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21956-21961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the major histocompatibility complex class II HLA-DRA (36Jabrane-Ferrat N. Fontes J.D. Boss J.M. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) promoters, this element is present within a silencer region. It is not clear, however, if the same proteins are responsible for silencing these and the ANT2 promoters. Thus, whether the GTCCTG element recognizes a specific silencing factor remains an open question. The ANT2 GTCCTG element-binding protein isolated by us is composed of two major polypeptides of 37 and 49 kDa. Cross-linking studies show that only p37 binds DNA. p49 appears to be loosely associated with p37, and the two can be partially separated during chromatographic separation. However, p49 appears to strengthen the binding of p37, because chromatographic fractions containing predominantly p37 bind the DNA probe weakly. Thus, p49 appears to function as an ancillary protein to p37. This behavior is reminiscent of that displayed by members of the Ets family. For example, GABPα binding to DNA is greatly enhanced by GABPβ (37Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 38Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and Elk-1 (39Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G. Reddy E.S. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and Sap-1 (40Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) require contact with the serum response factor before contacting the serum response element. Nuclear respiratory factor-2 (41Virbasius J.V. Virbasius C.-m.A. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), a GABP family factor that functions as a transcriptional activator in the promoters of several OXPHOS genes (see Ref. 42Scarpulla R.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar for a review), was recently described. Although the ANT2 silencer element contains repeated CCT motifs, which could form the core binding element of the GABP proteins, GABPα has a larger mass (58 kDa) (41Virbasius J.V. Virbasius C.-m.A. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) than the ANT2-binding protein (37 kDa). Furthermore, to our knowledge, there is no report that the GABP proteins function in any capacity than activating. Because of this, and because of our inability to induce supershifts with antibodies against general Ets proteins, we conclude that the ANT2 binding factors most probably do not belong to the Ets family. Multiple forms of the NF1 family were recently reported to bind to the glutathione transferase P promoter silencer (43Osada S. Daimon S. Ikeda T. Nishihara T. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Imagawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Four major polypeptides were isolated in a complex that bound to the dominant GPS4 silencer element containing the GTCCTG element (43Osada S. Daimon S. Ikeda T. Nishihara T. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Imagawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These polypeptides ranged from 33 to 41 kDa, close to the mass of the ANT2 p37-binding protein. However, a conserved NF1 binding element could not be detected by a computer search of the ANT2 silencer. Thus, it seems unlikely that we have isolated members of the NF1 family, although this remains to be rigidly excluded. There are, however, several interesting similarities between the glutathione transferase P and ANT2 silencer regions: (a) both contain multiple protein binding sites, (b) mutation in single sites results in a significant increase in promoter activity, and (c) despite the fact that expression of the glutathione transferase P gene is restricted to tumor cells derived from the liver, silencer activity was observed with no tissue restriction (34Imagawa M. Osada S. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This correlates well with previous results from ANT2 transfection experiments (14Li R. Hodny Z. Luciakova K. Baráth P. Nelson B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18925-18930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and with the observation that ANT2 GTCCTG binding activity is widely distributed in mammalian tissues (Fig. 3 B). A 36-kDa DNA-binding protein was isolated (44Durand B. Kobr M. Reith W. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6839-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that most probably binds to the human HLA-DRA Vbox silencer (36Jabrane-Ferrat N. Fontes J.D. Boss J.M. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that contains a GTCCTG element. This polypeptide has not been identified, and its relationship to the ANT2 p37 DNA-binding proteins is unknown. As discussed above, there are reasonably strong arguments that p37 might belong to a class of silencer proteins that have not previously been identified. In view of the apparent broad distribution of GTCCTG binding activity, it is important to identify p37 and establish its role in promoter silencing. The role of the silencer region in expression of the ANT2 gene also remains to be delineated. The ANT2 gene was isolated as one of the early immediate genes during the growth stimulation of quiescent cells (11Battini R. Ferrari S. Kaczmarek L. Calabretta B. Chen S.-T. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several laboratories demonstrated regulation of the ANT2 gene under different physiological conditions. ANT2 transcripts are up-regulated in activated T cells and various growth-activated cells (45Kaczmarek L. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We recently identified a far upstream promoter region (−1237/−546) that appears to be responsible for the down-regulation of ANT2 transcript during the growth of NIH3T3 cells to confluence.2 However, the nature of this suppression and its mechanism are not known; therefore, we cannot exclude the interaction of this region with other elements within the ANT2 promoter including the silencer described in this work.

https://openalex.org/W2049315985,"4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are believed to have important regulatory functions in controlling the rate of translation initiation in mammalian cells. They do so by binding to the mRNA cap-binding protein, eIF4E, thereby inhibiting formation of the cap-binding complex, a process essential for cap-dependent translation initiation. We have reproduced the translation-repressive function of human 4E-BP1 in yeast and find its activity to be dependent on substitution of human eIF4E for its yeast counterpart. Translation initiation and growth are inhibited when human 4E-BP1 is expressed in a strain with the human eIF4E substitution, but not in an unmodified strain. We have compared the relative affinities of human 4E-BP1 for human and yeast eIF4E, both in vitro using an m7GTP cap-binding assay and in vivo using a yeast two-hybrid assay, and find that the affinity of human 4E-BP1 for human eIF4E is markedly greater than for yeast eIF4E. Thus yeast eIF4E lacks structural features required for binding to human 4E-BP1. These results therefore demonstrate that the features of eIF4E required for binding to 4E-BP1 are distinct from those required for cap-complex assembly. 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are believed to have important regulatory functions in controlling the rate of translation initiation in mammalian cells.

These results therefore demonstrate that the features of eIF4E required for binding to 4E-BP1 are distinct from those required for cap-complex assembly. The initiation of translation requires recognition by small ribosomal subunits of the 5′ end of mRNA. In eukaryotes, this is mediated by the assembly of a complex of proteins, known as eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; 4E-BP, 4E-binding protein; BD, binding domain; AD, activation domain.1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; 4E-BP, 4E-binding protein; BD, binding domain; AD, activation domain.4F, which recognizes the mRNA 5′ cap structure. Modulation of eIF4F assembly is an important mechanism by which the rate of translation initiation is regulated according to the general demand for protein synthesis. The two most conserved components of eIF4F, found in all eukaryotes, are eIF4E, which binds to the cap structure directly, and eIF4G, a multifunctional polypeptide that binds to eIF4E and to other essential translation initiation factors. The binding of eIF4E to eIF4G is crucial for cap-dependent translation initiation and is believed to be subject to an important regulatory mechanism in mammalian cells involving 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), the subject of this study (reviewed in Refs. 1McCarthy J.E.G.

Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 8Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The competition appears to be inversely phosphorylation-dependent. 4E-BP1 is known to be phosphorylated in response to stimuli that promote increases in the rate of translation (9Hu C. Pang S.

A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but only binds to eIF4E in its hypophosphorylated state (10Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gringas A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). How important a regulatory mechanism is this in vivo? And, if regulation of translation initiation through 4E-BPs is important in mammals, to what extent has this regulatory mechanism been conserved throughout evolution? In order to start to answer these questions and to establish a system with which to dissect the details of 4E-BP function, we have reproduced the activity of human 4E-BP1 in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. In S. cerevisiae, a small polypeptide, p20, co-purifies with the cap-binding complex and, like mammalian 4E-BPs, contains an amino acid sequence that resembles the 4E-binding domain of eIF4G (12Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is not clear to what extent p20 and mammalian 4E-BPs are related; however, they do share some functional similarities. p20 can also be phosphorylated (although, unlike mammalian 4E-BP1, p20 is phosphorylated following heat-shock, Ref. 13Zanchin N.I.T. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26505-26510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study shows that p20 interacts with some, but not all, of the same evolutionarily conserved residues on eIF4E that are recognized by eIF4G (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of p20 for yeast eIF4E, however, appears to be significantly lower than that of eIF4G, suggesting that p20 may not be an efficient competitor of eIF4G binding (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here we show that when human 4E-BP1 is expressed in an unmodified yeast strain, no effects on growth are observed. However, when the same protein is expressed in a strain in which human eIF4E is expressed instead of the endogenous yeast eIF4E (mammalian eIF4E functions inS. cerevisiae, Ref. 15Altmann M. Müller P.P. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12145-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), growth is strongly impaired, and this correlates with an apparent inhibition of translation initiation, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of 80 S ribosomal subunit dimers relative to translating ribosomes. These results indicate that the translation regulatory function of human 4E-BP1 can be reproduced in yeast, but that its activity is specifically dependent on the co-expression of human eIF4E. Using both a cap-binding assayin vitro and two-hybrid analysis in yeast, we show that the binding affinity of human 4E-BP1 for human eIF4E is greater than that for yeast eIF4E. Thus, the specificity of 4E-BP function in yeast is a direct reflection of the difference between its binding affinities for the two eIF4E proteins. We conclude that, whereas the determinants on eIF4E for functional eIF4G binding are conserved between man and yeast, the determinants for 4E-BP1 binding are not, which suggests that the binding sites on human eIF4E for eIF4G and for 4E-BP1 are not identical. Plasmid DNA containing the human 4E-BP1 coding sequence was kindly provided by Dr. A.-C. Gingras of the Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Canada. This DNA was used as template in a polymerase chain reaction to generate DNA encoding 4E-BP1 with an N-terminal “Flag” (16Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and flanked by NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, in which the ATG of the NdeI site forms the initiating methionine codon of the Flag sequence. The sequence of the Flag tag, inferred from the DNA, was MDYKDDDDKTM, the second M being the initial amino acid of 4E-BP1. The NdeI-BamHI restricted DNA was inserted at the NdeI and BglII sites of the yeast expression plasmid YCpSupex2, which contains a strong, galactose-inducible promoter (composed of the fused upstream regions of the yeast GAL1 and PGK1 genes) upstream of the insertion site and a PGK1 gene transcription terminator downstream of the insertion site (17Oliveira C.C. van den Heuvel J.J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A ClaI restriction fragment containing the complete recombinant gene, including the promoter and terminator elements, was then excised and inserted at the ClaI site of pRS313, a yeast centromeric plasmid containing the HIS3-selectable marker gene (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid is named YCp313-fBP1. Human cDNA encoding eIF4E was kindly provided by Prof. C. Proud, Department of Anatomy and Physiology, University of Dundee, Scotland. After amplification with suitable primers in a polymerase chain reaction, it was inserted between the NdeI andXbaI sites of YCp22-FL (19Oliveira C.C. Goossen B. Zanchin N.I.T. McCarthy J.E.G. Hentze M.W. Stripecke R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5316-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the ATG of the NdeI site forming the initiator codon of the human eIF4E coding sequence. In this plasmid the eIF4E sequence is flanked upstream by the yeastTEF1 gene promoter and downstream by the PGK1gene transcription terminator. This plasmid supports constitutive expression of human eIF4E in yeast and contains the TRP1marker gene for selection. It is named YCpTrp-hu4E. A haploid S. cerevisiae strain expressing human instead of yeast eIF4E, Jo56: cdc33::LEU2 his3 ura3 ade2[YCpTrp-hu4E TRP1], was derived from strain T93C (20Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4467-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) after crossing to introduce the his3 auxotrophic mutation and transforming with the plasmid YCpTrp-hu4E. In order to test the effects of 4E-BP1 expression, plasmid YCp313-fBP1 was introduced into this and into strain Jo8: CDC33 his3-Δ ura3-52leu2-3,112 lys1-1 ade2-1can1-100, which carries an intact chromosomal eIF4E gene. Cultures were grown in appropriate selective nutrient “drop-out” media containing either 2% glucose or galactose. Cultures for the analysis of polysome profiles were grown to exponential phase initially in selective media containing glucose and then diluted into selective media containing galactose and cultured for a further 18 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested and fractionated on sucrose density gradients as described previously (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For expression in E. coli, the yeast and human eIF4E and 4E-BP1 DNA coding sequences were inserted between theNdeI and BamHI sites of the heat-inducible expression vector pCYTEXP3 (21Schneppe B. Eichner W. McCarthy J.E.G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Six histidine codons were inserted between the first and second codons of the 4E-BP1 sequence. Expression was induced in the protease-deficient E. coli strain CAG629. Human and yeast eIF4E were purified from inclusion bodies and by affinity for m7GTP Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (22Lang V. Zanchin Z. Lünsdorf H. Tuite M.F. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Edery I. Lee K.A.W. Sonenberg N. Illan I. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression. Plenum Press, NY1987: 335-366Crossref Google Scholar), but with the addition of 2 mm dithiothreitol to all buffer solutions following renaturation. His-tagged 4E-BP1 was purified denatured on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) following the supplier's recommended methods. This was performed as described previously, using 10 μg of each purified protein per sample (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The method of Fields and Song (24Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4838) Google Scholar) in the form of the Matchmaker Gal4 Two-Hybrid System (CLONTECH) was used according to supplier's instructions (http://www.clontech.com) to investigate interactions between eIF4E and 4E-BP1 in yeast. The complete human or yeast eIF4E coding sequence was inserted between the SmaI andBamHI sites of plasmid pGBT9 to create a fusion in-frame with the Gal4p DNA-binding domain (BD, Fig. 4 A). Meanwhile, the human 4E-BP1 coding sequence was inserted between theSmaI and BamHI sites of the plasmid pGAD424 to create a fusion in-frame with the Gal4p transcription activation domain (AD, Fig. 4 A). The two recombinant plasmids encoding the hybrid proteins were introduced into the yeast strain HF7c, in which interaction between the two hybrid proteins is detected by expression of separate Gal4-responsive reporter genes,lacZ and HIS3. The human 4E-BP1 cDNA (kindly provided by Ann-Claude Gingras, McGill University, Montreal), including a sequence encoding a 10-amino acid N-terminal Flag polypeptide (Fig.1 A), was inserted downstream of a galactose-inducible promoter in a yeast centromeric plasmid expression vector. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into two different yeast strains: one carrying an unmodified yeast eIF4E gene (CDC33) and the second carrying a disrupted eIF4E gene (cdc33) but containing a constitutively expressed human eIF4E gene on a plasmid. CDC33 is an essential yeast gene, but eIF4E is sufficiently conserved so that the mammalian gene complements cdc33 (15Altmann M. Müller P.P. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12145-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants containing the 4E-BP1 expression plasmid were cultured initially in glucose-containing medium, in which the 4E-BP1 gene is repressed, and then transferred to galactose-containing medium in order to induce 4E-BP1 expression. When the N-terminally flagged 4E-BP1 gene is expressed in the strain with yeast eIF4E, no effect on growth is observed (Fig. 1 B, compare Yeast eIF4E + BP1 Induced andRepressed and the Control strain, which carries the appropriate plasmid expression vector without the 4E-BP1 gene.) However, when the flagged 4E-BP1 gene is expressed in the strain in which human eIF4E has been substituted for yeast eIF4E, a strong inhibition of growth is observed (Fig. 1 B, compareHuman eIF4E + BP1 Induced andRepressed and the Control strain.) When the growth rates of these strains are measured in liquid culture, 4E-BP1 expression with human eIF4E results in a cell doubling time of 15 h, compared with about 3 h when 4E-BP1 is expressed with yeast eIF4E and for the controls (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the expression of human 4E-BP1 in yeast inhibits growth in a manner that is specifically dependent on co-expression of human eIF4E instead of endogenous yeast eIF4E. Yeast strains expressing either yeast or human eIF4E and containing either the plasmid with the galactose-inducible 4E-BP1 gene, or the plasmid vector alone as control, were first cultured in glucose-containing medium and then transferred to galactose-containing medium in order to induce 4E-BP1 expression. After 18 h of induction, the cells were harvested, and polyribosomes were fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. No changes in the polysome profiles due to expression of 4E-BP1 with yeast eIF4E are observed (Fig. 2,A and B), indicating that expression of 4E-BP1 does not affect translation in this strain. However, expression of 4E-BP1 with human eIF4E causes a marked relative accumulation of 80 S particles and of 40 S subunits (Fig. 2 C) compared with the control (Fig. 2 D). When 7 m NaCl is included in the fractionation buffers (Fig. 2, E and F), the large 80 S peak (Fig. 2 C) is mainly replaced by 40 and 60 S peaks (Fig. 2 E), suggesting that the 80 S particles accumulating as a result of 4E-BP1 expression are composed largely of subunit dimers, which are known to be less resistant to dissociation at high concentrations of salt, rather than translating ribosomes (25Martin T.E. Hartwell L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1504-1508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The accumulation of subunit dimers has been observed in a number of conditions in which translation initiation is impaired (26Vasilescu S. Ptushkina M. Linz B. Müller P.P. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7030-7037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Zhong T. Arndt K.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1175-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It seems likely, therefore, that the growth inhibition caused by co-expression of human 4E-BP1 and human eIF4E in yeast is due to impaired translation initiation. Given what is known of the function of mammalian 4E-BP1, we assume that the impaired growth and translation initiation observed when human 4E-BP1 and human eIF4E are co-expressed in yeast is due to direct interaction between these two proteins. Correspondingly, the lack of any effects due to the expression of 4E-BP1 in combination with yeast eIF4E could be due to a lack of binding. In order to test this hypothesis, we investigated the relative binding of 4E-BP1 to yeast and human eIF4E by observing the association of the purified proteins bound to m7GTP-Sepharose, for which eIF4E has affinity. Human eIF4E and 4E-BP1 and yeast eIF4E were expressed and purified fromE. coli. Equal amounts of either yeast or human eIF4E were mixed with 4E-BP1 and then adsorbed to m7GTP-Sepharose. After removing unbound material, protein complexes specifically bound to the m7GTP ligand were eluted by the addition of excess m7GDP and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of human 4E-BP1 associated with m7GTP-bound human eIF4E was found to be significantly greater than that associated with m7GTP-bound yeast eIF4E (Fig. 3). This indicates that, under these conditions, the binding affinity of 4E-BP1 for human eIF4E is greater than that for yeast eIF4E. We investigated the relative difference in the affinities between human and yeast eIF4E and 4E-BP1 in vivo using a yeast two-hybrid interaction assay. In this assay, evidence of interaction is provided by transcriptional activation of Gal4p-responsive reporter genes, due to reconstitution of Gal4p activity. Gal4p activity can be reconstituted when a test protein fused to the Gal4p DNA binding domain (BD) interacts with a second test protein fused to the Gal4p transcription activation domain (AD). We fused either the human or the yeast eIF4E coding sequence in-frame with the Gal4p BD coding sequence and the human 4E-BP1 coding sequence with the Gal4p AD coding sequence (Fig.4 A). These two hybrid genes, in their appropriate plasmid expression vectors, were introduced into a yeast reporter strain in which both the yeast HIS3 and the bacterial lacZ genes can be expressed in response to Gal4p activity. Fig. 4 B illustrates the growth of the reporter strain expressing combinations of the hybrid proteins on selective media with or without histidine. Growth in the absence of added histidine reflects expression of the HIS3 reporter gene and is indicative of an interaction between the hybrid proteins. As controls, each of the hybrid proteins is also expressed in combination with either the Gal4p BD or AD alone. Only the combination of human eIF4E with 4E-BP1 supports growth on medium lacking histidine (Fig. 4 B). Neither the combination of yeast eIF4E with 4E-BP1 nor the controls support growth without histidine. The same pattern of expression was observed for the lacZ reporter gene (data not shown). These data therefore provide evidence that human eIF4E and 4E-BP1, but not yeast eIF4E and 4E-BP1, are able to interact under physiological conditions in vivo. We have reproduced the translation-repressive function of human 4E-BP1 in yeast and find that it targets human eIF4E specifically. Co-expression of these two proteins in the absence of endogenous yeast eIF4E impairs growth (Fig. 1, B and C), probably as a direct result of inhibition of translation initiation (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we demonstrate using two independent techniques that the affinity of 4E-BP1 for human eIF4E is greater than that for yeast eIF4E (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, the specificity of 4E-BP1 function in yeast is a direct reflection of the difference between its affinities for the two eIF4E proteins. 4E-BPs are believed to function by competing with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, thus inhibiting cap-complex formation (7Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Binding to eIF4E requires a conserved sequence of about 12 amino acids within the N-terminal domain of eIF4G and a similar sequence found in 4E-BPs (6 out of 12 residues in this sequence are identical in human and yeast eIF4G and human 4E-BP1, Ref. 8Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity of these sequences suggests that eIF4G and 4E-BPs share at least part of the same binding site on eIF4E. It is not known exactly which structural features of eIF4E are recognized by eIF4G and 4E-BPs. However, it is clear from our results that, whereas human eIF4E is sufficiently similar to yeast eIF4E to be recognized by yeast eIF4G and participate in yeast translation initiation, yeast eIF4E does not share all the structural features required for efficient recognition of human 4E-BP1. We conclude, therefore, that the binding sites on human eIF4E for 4E-BP1 and eIF4G are probably not identical. This situation may be similar to that of yeast p20 and eIF4G, for which it appears that p20 requires only a subset of those residues on yeast eIF4E that are required for binding by yeast eIF4G (14Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Vasilescu S. Frank R. Birkenhäger R. McCarthy J.E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4798-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Future work will be able to use the yeast model system described here to probe the detailed molecular basis of the interactions underlying this repressor-target specificity. We are indebted to Dr. A.-C. Gingras and Prof. C. Proud for the provision of plasmid DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2110484665,"Expression of the mouse immunoglobulin κ locus is regulated by the intron and 3′ enhancers. Previously, we have reported that these enhancers can synergize at mature B cell stages. Here we present our recent studies on the identification and characterization of the 3′ enhancer sequences that play important roles in this synergy. By performing mutational analyses with novel reporter constructs, we find that the 5′ region of the cAMP response element (CRE), the PU.1/PIP, and the E2A motifs of the 3′ enhancer are critical for the synergy. These motifs are known to contribute to the enhancer activity. However, we also show that mutating other functionally important sequences has no significant effect on the synergy. Those sequences include the 3′ region of the CRE motif, the BSAP motif, and the region 3′ of the E2A motif. We have further demonstrated that either the 5′-CRE, the PU.1/PIP, or the E2A motif alone is sufficient to synergize with the intron enhancer. Moreover, the PU.1 motif appears to act as a negative element at pre-B cell stages but as a positive element at mature B cell stages. We have also identified a novel negative regulatory sequence within the 3′ enhancer that contributes to the regulation of synergy, as well as developmental stage and tissue specificity of expression. While the levels of many of the 3′ enhancer binding factors change very little in cell lines representing different B cell stages, the intron enhancer binding factors significantly increase at more mature B cell stages."
https://openalex.org/W2070852795,"Recent crystallographic studies onEscherichia coli inorganic pyrophosphatase (E-PPase) have identified three Mg2+ ions/enzyme hexamer in water-filled cavities formed by Asn24, Ala25, and Asp26 at the trimer-trimer interface (Kankare, J., Salminen, T., Lahti, R., Cooperman, B., Baykov, A. A., and Goldman, A. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 4670–4677). Here we show that D26S and D26N substitutions decrease the stoichiometry of tight Mg2+ binding to E-PPase by approximately 0.5 mol/mol monomer and increase hexamer stability in acidic medium. Mg2+ markedly decelerates the dissociation of enzyme hexamer into trimers at pH 5.0 and accelerates hexamer formation from trimers at pH 7.2 with wild type E-PPase and the N24D variant, in contrast to the D26S and D26N variants, when little or no effect is seen. The catalytic parameters describing the dependences of enzyme activity on substrate and Mg2+ concentrations are of the same magnitude for wild type E-PPase and the three variants. The affinity of the intertrimer site for Mg2+ at pH 7.2 is intermediate between those of two Mg2+ binding sites found in the E-PPase active site. It is concluded that the metal ion binding site found at the trimer-trimer interface of E-PPase is a high affinity site whose occupancy by Mg2+ greatly stabilizes the enzyme hexamer but has little effect on catalysis.

Inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1; PPase 1The abbreviations used are: PPase, inorganic pyrophosphatase; PPi, pyrophosphate; E-PPase, E. coli pyrophosphatase; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TES, 2-((2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl)amino)ethanesulfonic acid; TAPS, 3-((2-hydroxy-1,1-bis (hydroxymethyl)ethyl)amino)-1-propanesulfonic acid.) belongs to a group of enzymes catalyzing phosphoryl transfer from phosphoric acid anhydrides to water, a principal reaction of cellular energetics. Soluble PPases hydrolyze PPi to Pi with release of energy as heat and provide in this way a thermodynamic pull for many biosynthetic reactions (1Kornberg A. Kasha H. Pullman P. Horizons in Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1962: 251-264Google Scholar). PPases are essential in bacteria (2Chen J. Brevet A. Formant M. Leveque F. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J.

Escherichia coli PPase (E-PPase) is homohexameric, like many other prokaryotic PPases (5Hachimori A. Shiroya Y. Hirato A. Miyahara T. Samejima T. J. Biochem.

The active site, present in each 20-kDa monomeric unit, contains 14 polar amino acid residues that are completely conserved in all known soluble PPases, despite only moderate sequence similarity in the rest of the molecule (9Cooperman B.S.

The principal trimer-trimer interaction involves a three-center ionic, hydrogen-bonding interaction among the residues His140-Asp143-His136′ (11Harutyunyan E.H. Oganessyan V.Y. Oganessyan N.N.

Another important trimer-trimer interaction occurs among Asn24, Ala25, and Asp26 (Fig.1). The cavity formed by Asn24-Asp26 and Asn24′-Asp26′ contains several water molecules one of which is replaced by Mg2+ when the crystals are soaked in a decimolar concentration of a magnesium salt (15Kankare J.

As a result of the Mg2+ binding, the side chains of the Asn24 residues reorient, and the trimers move toward each other by about 0.4 Å. Metal ions, including Mg2+, are rare but not uncommon at subunit interfaces (18Hill C.P. Dauter Z. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Dunn M.F.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5999-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were able to engineer a metal binding site at the interface formed by trypsin and its protein inhibitor ecotin. However, in all known instances the intersubunit metal ion is coordinated directly to protein residues except for E-PPase where it is connected through water molecules (15Kankare J. Salminen T. Lahti R. Cooperman B. Baykov A.A. Goldman A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4670-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,17Harurtyunyan E.H. Oganessyan V.Y. Oganessyan N.N. Avaeva S.M. Nazarova T.I.

On the other hand, water-filled cavities often occur at protein interfaces (23Hubbard S.J. Argos P. Prot. Sci. 1994; 3: 2194-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and in protein interiors (24Williams M.A. Goodfellow J.M. Thornton J.M. Prot. Sci. 1994; 3: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Because even large molecules can rapidly penetrate deep into proteins and bind to seemingly inaccessible cavities (25Petsko G.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 565-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it is not unlikely that, in vivo, protein cavities can contain metal ions, especially Mg2+, the most abundant divalent cation in the cell. Understanding the effects of these cavities on protein properties may therefore be important in understanding how proteins function in vivo as well as in designing interacting proteins and ligands that can disrupt protein-protein interactions. The present work addresses two major questions: (a) Does the intertrimer cavity in E-PPase bind Mg2+ strongly enough to be occupied appreciably at its physiological concentration? (b) What is the role of this unusual binding site in hexamer stability and catalytic activity? Wild type and wild type-free variant PPases were expressed using the overproducing E. coli strains HB101 (26Lahti R. Pohjanoksa K. Pitkaranta T. Heikinheimo P. Salminen T. Meyer P. Heinonen J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5761-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and MC1061/YPPAI(Δppa) (27Salminen T. Käpylä J. Heikinheimo P. Kankare J. Goldman A. Heinonen J. Baykov A.A.

The enzymes were purified by chromatography on Fast Flow DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), heat treatment at 65 °C, and gel filtration on a column (2.6 × 60 cm) of Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (27Salminen T.

The final preparations were homogeneous according to SDS and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation velocity measurements. The enzyme concentration was estimated on the basis of a subunit molecular mass of 20 kDa (28Josse J. J. Biol.

Initial rates of PPi hydrolysis were estimated from continuous recordings of phosphate production obtained with an automatic phosphate analyzer (30Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The assay medium of 25 ml total volume contained, except as noted, 20 μmMg2PPi, 20 mm Mg2+, 0.05 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.2), and 40 μm EGTA. The reaction was initiated by adding a suitable aliquot of enzyme solution and carried out for 3–4 min at 25 °C. No appreciable interconversion between the hexamer and less active trimer was observed during the assay, as evidenced by nearly linear product formation curves. Differential spectra of PPase induced by Mg2+ were recorded with a computer-controlled LKB Ultrospec Plus spectrophotometer in a 1-cm cuvette containing 0.7 ml of enzyme solution. After the base line stabilized, stock MgCl2 solution was added in 0.7-μl increments, and the spectra were recorded. Equilibrium microdialysis (31Käpylä J. Hyytiä T. Lahti R. Goldman A. Baykov A.A.

Equations 1 and 2, derived from Scheme I, describe time courses of activity (A) resulting from hexamer (E 6) dissociation into trimers (E 3) and the reverse reaction, as well as the equilibrium activity (at t = ∞,dαH/dt = 0) as functions of enzyme concentration. A H andA T are specific activities of the hexamer and trimer, respectively, αH is the fraction of enzyme in hexameric form at time t, [E]t is total enzyme concentration, expressed in monomers, ka andkd are the apparent rate constants for hexamer formation and breakdown, respectively, measured at fixed H+and Mg2+ concentrations. Equations 1 and 2 were fit to data simultaneously with SCIENTIST (MicroMath). 2E3⇄kdkaE6 SCHEMEI.Hexamer­trimer equilibration A=AT+(AH−AT)αHEquation 1 dαHdt=23ka[E]t(1−αH)2−kdαHEquation 2 The pH dependence of PPase activity at trimer-hexamer equilibrium is described by Equations 1 and 2 withdαH/dt = 0 and the apparentKd =kd/ka given by Equation3, where Kd ′ is the pH-independent dissociation constant for the hexamer, Ka is the microscopic dissociation constant for H+ binding to the trimer, andm is the number of protons bound per hexamer. Kd=Kd′1+[H+]KamEquation 3 The effect of Mg2+ on ka at fixed pH is described by Equation 4, derived for the simplified model shown in Fig. 2. The model assumes that (a) a hexamer is formed from two trimers containing in total from zero to three metal ions bound at the trimer-trimer interface and (b) the association rate constant is equal tok a,0 for trimers without metal ions and increases by the same factor p with each added metal ion. Here γ = 1/(1 + K in′/[M]) is the probability of finding a metal ion (M) in one of the three metal ion binding sites/trimer, and K in′ is the respective metal binding constant for the trimer. Statistical factors of 12 (6 + 6) and 4 (2 + 2) were used when more than one metal ion was present in two interacting trimers, taking into account that the combination of two metal-bound monomers within a single subunit-subunit interface is not allowed (Fig. 2). ka=ka,0[(1−γ)6+6pγ(1−γ)5+12p2γ2(1−γ)4+4p3γ3(1−γ)3]Equation 4 Values of the dissociation constants for the successive binding of two Mg2+ ions to the E-PPase active site (K M1 and K M2) and for Mg2+ binding to the subunit interface site (K in) (Scheme II) were estimated by fitting Equation 5 to measured values of n, the number of Mg2+ ions bound per monomer, as a function of free Mg2+ concentration. The first term in Equation 5 describes binding to the active site, and the second binding to the intertrimer site. The second term was ignored for variants that exhibited no binding to the intertrimer site (K in = ∞). Scheme II assumes that the binding reactions in the active site and in the intertrimer site are mutually independent.

ΔA245=Δε[E]t[M]KM2+[M]Equation 6 Values of the apparent catalytic constant k h and the apparent Michaelis constant K m,h were obtained from rateversus [Mg2PPi] dependences measured at fixed Mg2+ concentrations.

The assumption in deriving Equation 7 is thatk h greatly exceeds the rate constant for Mg2PPi release from the enzyme, as has been shown elsewhere for wild type E-PPase (33Baykov A.A. Hyytiä T.

The effects of substitutions at both Asn24 and Asp26 on quaternary structure and enzyme activity were studied as a function of pH. Direct evidence for shifts in the hexamer-trimer equilibrium was obtained from sedimentation data (TableI). At pH 7.2,s 20,w for WT-PPase, and the three variants studied here (N24D, D26N, D26S) fell in the range 6.3–6.7 S, characteristic of a hexamer (28Josse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1938-1947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Baykov A.A. Dudarenkov V.Y. Käpylä J. Salminen T. Hyytiä T. Kasho V.N. Husgafvel S. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Lahti R. J.

Lowering the pH to 5.0 had differential effects. s 20,w decreased to 4.3 for both WT-PPase and N24D-PPase, decreased only to 5.2 for D26S-PPase, and was unchanged for D26N-PPase. Further lowering the pH to 3.8 led to s 20,w values of 3.3–4.0 for all four PPases. Because the molecular mass of WT-PPase at pH 5.0 estimated by sedimentation equilibrium measurements (20 °C, 20 μm initial enzyme concentration) was 63 ± 1 kDa, these results indicate that WT-PPase and N24D-PPase are fully in the trimeric form by pH 5.0 but that lower pH is required for full conversion to trimer of the D26S and D26N variants. That such dissociation is reversible is shown by the increase ins 20,w back to 6.7 ± 0.2 S when the pH of a WT-PPase sample is raised from 5.0 to 7.2. At pH 3.8, the variant PPases may undergo further dissociation to dimers or monomers as suggested by lower s 20,w values compared with WT-PPase.Table ISedimentation coefficientsEnzyme variants 20,wpH 3.8pH 5.0pH 7.2WT4.0 ± 0.14.3 ± 0.26.3 ± 0.2N24D3.3 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.16.4 ± 0.4D26N3.5 ± 0.16.9 ± 0.36.4 ± 0.4D26S3.4 ± 0.15.2 ± 0.36.7 ± 0.1Conditions were 2–4 °C, 10 μm enzyme, 48,000 rpm.

Trimers of WT-PPase and the three variants investigated in this paper also had lower activity, and studies of the effect of pH on enzyme activity, paralleling those ons 20,w, demonstrated conclusively that rates and equilibria of hexamer-trimer interconversion could be monitored by activity measurements. The activities presented in Fig.3 represent equilibrium values, no changes being observed on longer incubation at the final pH values. Matching the s 20,w values, they demonstrate that as pH is lowered from 7.2 to 5.0, WT- and N24D-PPase are fully converted to less active forms, D26S-PPase is partially converted, whereas D26N-PPase retains almost full activity, and, in addition, lowering the pH further to 3.8 converts the latter two variants virtually completely to their lower activity forms. Furthermore, WT-PPase activity increases with enzyme concentration at pH 5.0 (Fig. 4, inset), as expected for an equilibrium between an active hexamer and less active trimer, and activity is a fully reversible property of pH (Fig. 4). The N24D, D26S, and D26N variants, inactivated at pH 5.0, 4.8, and 3.9, respectively, could also be reactivated at pH 7.2, affording > 80% of original activity. Finally, in all cases, inactivation and reactivation followed strict first- and second-order kinetics, respectively.Figure 4Reversibility of WT-PPase inactivation at pH 5.0.

Satisfactory fits were obtained when the number of bound protons per hexamer (m) was equal to 6, 2, 2, or 12 for WT-, D26N-, D26S-, and N24D-PPase, respectively. From earlier work (35Volk S.E.

As estimated from time courses of activity loss at pH 5.0 and restoration at pH 7.2, added Mg2+ markedly decreased kd (Fig.5) and increased ka (Fig.6) for WT- and N24D-PPases. The sigmoidal dependence of ka on [Mg2+] was described satisfactorily by Equation 4, yielding fitted values ofK in′, k a,0, andp (Table II) which were similar for both PPases. The K in ′ values may reflect the dissociation constant from a half-of-interface site (for WT-PPase, residues 24–26 from one subunit).Figure 6The rate constant for wild type and variant PPase reactivation at pH 7.2 as a function of Mg2+concentration. The enzyme inactivated at pH 5.0 (see Fig. 3) was diluted to 0.4 μm with 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.2, 25 ° C) containing varying amounts of Mg2+, and the time course of PPase activity was measured.

In full agreement with these data, the activity versus pH profile for WT-PPase (Fig. 3) shifted to lower pH values at higher Mg2+ concentrations, as inferred from the observation that WT-PPase retained 80% activity at pH 5 in the presence of 140 mm MgCl2. In contrast, for D26S- and D26N-PPase, the already low value ofkd in the absence of Mg2+ was somewhat increased by the addition of Mg2+ (Fig. 5), most likely because of nonspecific binding. Similarly,ka for D26S-PPase in the absence of Mg2+ is 5–10 times larger than the corresponding values for WT- and N24D-PPases and rises only slightly as [Mg2+] is raised (Fig. 6). Mg2+ binding to WT- and the variant E-PPases was measured by equilibrium dialysis, providing the macroscopic binding constants for all three types of the metal binding sites present in E-PPase, M1 and M2 at the active site and Min at the trimer-trimer interface, and by differential spectroscopy (16Avaeva S.M.

Baykov, T. Hyytiä, M. V. Turkina, I. S. Efimova, V. N. Kasho, A. Goldman, B. S. Cooperman, and R. Lahti, manuscript in preparation. provides the binding constant for M2. The dialysis data indicated a decrease in the stoichiometry of tightly binding sites by approximately 0.5 mol/mol monomer in the D26S and D26N variants, but not in the N24D variant, when compared with WT-PPase (Fig. 7). These data are thus consistent with a loss of Min upon Asp26 substitution and also suggest that Min displays high affinity for Mg2+. These conclusions were supported by quantitative analysis of the binding data. The binding affinity of M1 was only slightly affected by the mutations, whereas the affinity of Min was increased 3-fold after N24D substitution, which introduced a negatively charged ligand into the intertrimer cavity. Accordingly, in the N24D variant sites M1 and Min have similar affinity for Mg2+, whereas in WT-PPase the order in which the three sites become occupied at increasing Mg2+concentration is M1, Min, M2 (TableIII).Table IIIDissociation constants for Mg2+ bindingEnzyme variantEquilibrium dialysisa25 °C, pH 7.2 (83 mm TES/KOH, 17 mm KCl, 50 μm EGTA), 0.35–0.70 mm enzyme, 0.02–3 mm Mg2+.UV spectroscopyb20 °C, pH 8.5 (0.09 m TAPS/KOH, 5 μm EGTA), 15 μm enzyme, 0.1–22 mm Mg2+.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 44-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) the affinity at site M2 appeared unaffected by the substitutions (Table III). Moreover, the values obtained for the three variants are essentially identical to those measured by dialysis at pH 7.2. The one apparent inconsistency in the data concerns the considerably higher value obtained by dialysis for WT-PPase at pH 7.2. However, the error in this value is quite high because it greatly exceeds the enzyme concentration used in these measurements. As measured byk h,k h/K m,h, andk 1, substitution at the subunit interface has only minor effects on PPase catalytic function determined at pH 7.2 as a function of [Mg2+]. Values of k hand k h/K m,h (Fig.8) were generally quite similar for WT, N24D-, D26N-, and D26S-PPases, with the exception thatk h/K m,h was somewhat lower for N24D-PPase. Values of k 1were also determined as a function of [Mg2+] and interpreted according to Scheme II (Table IV) . For WT-PPase and N24D-PPase, binding to the interface site has at most a small effect onk 1 (i.e. k 1(1) is approximately equal tok 1(3)), but binding to M2 lowersk 1 (k 1(3) >k 1(4)). Consistent with these results, the two variants lacking a high affinity Mg2+interface site, D26N- and D26S-PPases, havek 1(1) values similar to that for WT-PPase, and their k 1(2) values (reflecting M2 site occupancy) are both lower than theirk 1(1) values and similar tok 1(4) for WT-PPase It should be noted that k 1(2) could not be estimated for WT- and N24D-PPase because the M2E species was stoichiometrically insignificant for these variants.Table IVRate constants for substrate bindingEnzyme variantk 1(1)k 1(2)k 1(3)k 1(4)μm−1s−1μm−1s−1μm−1s−1μm−1 s−1WT380 ± 40330 ± 2057 ± 8N24D200 ± 50120 ± 1048 ± 3D26N360 ± 2042 ± 10D26S360 ± 1062 ± 5Results were estimated with Equation 7, using the metal binding constants obtained by equilibrium dialysis (Table III); for WT-PPase,K M2 was also an adjustable parameter, whose best fit value was found to be 3.5 mm.

Conditions were: 25 °C, pH 7.2 (83 mm TES/KOH, 17 mm KCl, 50 μm EGTA). Equilibrium dialysis measurements have revealed three types of metal binding sites in E-PPase (33Baykov A.A. Hyytiä T. Volk S.E. Kasho V.N. Vener A.V. Goldman A. Lahti R. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4655-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which we now designate as sites M1, Min, and M2, following the order in which they become occupied in WT-PPase at an increasing Mg2+ concentration at pH 7.2 (Table III). We assumed previously that the three binding sites are present in each subunit of homohexameric E-PPase (33Baykov A.A. Hyytiä T. Volk S.E. Kasho V.N. Vener A.V. Goldman A. Lahti R. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4655-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, crystallographic identification of an Mg2+ ion between pairs of subunits (15Kankare J. Salminen T. Lahti R. Cooperman B. Baykov A.A. Goldman A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4670-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Harurtyunyan E.H. Oganessyan V.Y. Oganessyan N.N. Avaeva S.M. Nazarova T.I.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7754-7760Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) together with the effects of Asn24 and Asp26 mutations on metal binding and hexamer stability reported above suggest a binding stoichiometry of 0.5 mol/mol monomer for one of the sites detected by equilibrium dialysis. Two other lines of evidence support the idea that the site with intermediate affinity is located at the subunit interface. First, x-ray crystallographic data show that E-PPase crystals soaked in 140 mm MgCl2 contain Mg2+ only at sites M1 and Min (15Kankare J. Salminen T. Lahti R. Cooperman B. Baykov A.A. Goldman A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4670-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas crystals grown at 250 mm MgCl2 contain Mg2+ at all three sites (17Harurtyunyan E.H. Oganessyan V.Y. Oganessyan N.N. Avaeva S.M. Nazarova T.I. Vorobyeva N.N. Kurilova S.A. Huber R. Mather T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7754-7760Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Also, the site that binds Mn2+ most tightly is located in the active site and exhibits a 1 mol/mol binding stoichiometry (11Harutyunyan E.H. Oganessyan V.Y. Oganessyan N.N. Terzyan S.S. Popov A.N. Rubinskiy S.B. Vainshtein B.K. Nazarova T.I. Kurilova S.A. Vorobyeva N.N. Avaeva S.M. Kristallografiya. 1996; 41: 84-96Google Scholar). Second, site Min is apparently absent in trimeric E-PPase prepared by substitution of both His136and His140 in the trimer-trimer interface (36Velichko I.S. Mikalahti K. Kasho V.N. Dudarenkov V.Y. Hyytiä T. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our results clearly show that [H+] and [Mg2+] determine the quaternary structure of E-PPase and agree with earlier studies showing that (a) low pH induces PPase hexamer dissociation (6Schreier E. FEBS Lett. 1980; 109: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 37Borshchik I.B. Magretova N.N. Chernyak V.Y. Sklyankina V.A. Avaeva S.M. Biokhimiya. 1986; 51: 1484-1489Google Scholar) and (b) in variants with weakened trimer-trimer interactions (H136Q-PPase, 32; E20D-PPase, 35) added Mg2+ stabilizes hexamer formation at pH values ≥ 7.2. A simple model consistent with our results is that protonation of one or more sites per monomer induces dissociation (Fig. 3). According to this model, added Mg2+ favors the hexamer because it competes with H+ for a common site (or sites), in addition to stabilizing hexamer structure as such directly. Consistent with this model are (a) the increased stability of the D26S and D26N hexamers because substitution of Asp26eliminates a potential protonation site, (b) the shift in activity versus pH profiles to lower pH values with increasing Mg2+ concentration, (c) the stability of hexamers at higher pH even in the absence of added Mg2+, and (d) the rise in ka for WT- and N24D-PPase with increasing [Mg2+] at pH 7.2, when the basic group(s) governing hexamer stability is(are) deprotonated (Fig.6). This model certainly suggests that Asp26 is at least one, and perhaps the major, basic group controlling hexamer stability in WT-PPase. This would require Asp26 to have a markedly elevated pKa of > 6.7, which would not be unexpected, given the extensive hydrogen bonding network at the subunit interface site (see Fig. 1). The value of m equal to 6 for WT-PPase suggests that all three Asp26 residues/trimer become protonated on subunit dissociation. Following this logic, it is tempting to speculate that the increase in m value to 12 for the N24D variant reflects protonation of the Asp24 and Asp26 residues in this variant. That m does not become 0 in the D26S and D26N variants would imply the presence of (an)other, lower pKa group(s) whose protonation also destabilizes the hexamer. One possibility is His140, as suggested previously (14Kankare J. Salminen T. Lahti R. Cooperman B. Baykov A.A. Goldman A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Baykov A.A. Dudarenkov V.Y. Käpylä J. Salminen T. Hyytiä T. Kasho V.N. Husgafvel S. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30804-30812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other carboxyl side chains, as yet unidentified, could be involved. It remains unclear why protonation of Asp26 would destabilize the hexamer, whereas mutation of Asp26 into Asn or Ser does not. The simplest possibility is that the hydrogen bonding network at the subunit interface site (Fig. 1) requires a hydrogen-bond acceptor at position 26, a role that can be filled by a carboxylate anion, by an amide, and by an alcohol, but not by a carboxylic acid. High resolution structures of the variants described in this paper could provide a clear test of the validity of our proposals. In summary, we have shown that the metal binding site formed by protein-bound water molecules at the trimer-trimer interface of E-PPase is a high affinity site whose occupancy by Mg2+ stabilizes the enzyme hexamer by neutralizing the negative charges and preventing protonation of a site or sites within the binding cavity, without having any substantial effect on catalysis.

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) 1The abbreviations used are: TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; PSP, progressive supranuclear palsy; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; RTH, rat TH; HTH, human TH. has been the subject of extensive investigation, largely because it catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of catecholamines. The regulation of the TH level and of its enzymatic activity is thus a major mechanism for controlling the amount of these important amines in blood and synapses. TH is regulated by almost all possible mechanisms of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control including regulation of the transcription rate, alternative splicing of the premessenger, variable stability of the mRNA, translational control, and modulation of the enzymatic activity (1Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that some human TH (HTH) gene sequence variants are associated with abnormal TH enzymatic activity and may be involved in some neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, point mutations in the coding sequence of HTH have been found that decrease the activity of the enzyme in patients withl-DOPA-responsive dystonia (2Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Mallet J. Ludecke B. Bartholome K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1209-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and inherited juvenilel-DOPA-responsive parkinsonism (3Ludecke B. Knappskog P.M. Clayton P.T.

There is also emerging evidence that alternative splicing of TH premessenger RNA may have physiological and even pathological consequences (4O'Malley K.L. Anhalt M.J. Martin B.M. Kelsoe J.R.

Initially, four HTH mRNA variants generated by alternative splicing were cloned and characterized by (i) the differential use of two splicing donor sites within exon 1 and (ii) the differential inclusion of exon 2 (4O'Malley K.L.

Interestingly, the amount of the species containing exon 2 (HTH-3 and HTH-4) is enhanced in pheochromocytoma, a tumor of adrenal medulla (4O'Malley K.L. Anhalt M.J. Martin B.M. Kelsoe J.R. Winfield S.L. Ginns E.I. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2910-2914Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The four mRNAs encode proteins that differ in the N-terminal regulatory region and present different enzymatic activities (1Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These data suggest that alternative splicing of TH premessenger RNA is significant and prompt us to further study the diversity of HTH mRNAs. Recently, we identified previously undetected HTH mRNA species lacking exon 3 in the adrenal medulla (5Dumas S. Le Hir H. Bodeau-Péan S. Hirsch E. Thermes C. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These novel variants are produced by the junction of the splicing donor sites of exons 1a-, 1b-, or 2- directly to the acceptor site of exon 4. By RNase mapping experiments, we have shown that exon 3 was skipped in 4 to 6% of the total HTH mRNA population in normal adrenal medulla, a proportion similar to that of the previously described HTH-3 and -4 mRNA species (11Coker G.T. Studelska D. Harmon S. Burke W. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Le Bourdelles B. Boularand S. Boni C. Horellou P. Dumas S. Grima B. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These novel mRNA species were unusually abundant (5Dumas S. Le Hir H. Bodeau-Péan S. Hirsch E. Thermes C. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in adrenal medulla of patients suffering from progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), which is a severe neurodegenerative disease predominantly characterized by an alteration of the catecholaminergic neurons within the basal ganglia (13Daniel S.E. de Bruin V.M.S. Lees A.J. Brain. 1995; 118: 759-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The novel mRNA species encode putative HTH proteins lacking the 74 amino acids of the exon 3. This region includes Ser31 and Ser40, two phosphorylation sites that participate in the regulation of HTH enzymatic activity (1Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is likely that the alternative splicing of exon 3 has consequences for the regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis. In the present work, we analyzed the expression of this novel HTH isoform lacking exon 3 (HTHΔ3) in human adrenals by Western blotting experiments. For that purpose, we raised an antibody against the HTH exon 3. We also tested the effect of exon 3 skipping on the in vitro enzymatic activity of HTH by the use of purified recombinant HTH proteins in fusion with glutathione-S-transferase (GST). It is clearly established that TH activity is positively regulated by phosphorylation and by binding to any of several polyanions such as heparin, polyglutamate, and phosphatidylserine, which change the conformational state of the enzyme (14Katz I.R. Yamauchi T. Kaufman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 84-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the heparin binding site on rat TH (RTH) has been described as being precisely localized within an exon corresponding to HTH exon 3 (15Daubner S.C. Piper M.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of exon 3 skipping on HTH activation by heparin and show that GST-HTHΔ3 enzymatic activity is insensitive to this molecule. Feedback inhibition by catecholamines is one of the major mechanisms for modulating HTH enzymatic activity, and the N-terminal part of the enzyme plays an important role in retroinhibition by dopamine (16Ota A. Yoshida S. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 1099-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus we tested the effect of dopamine on GST-HTHΔ3 activity and found that HTH exon 3 is required for feedback inhibition. The complete coding sequence of HTH3 was excised from PET3a (Stratagene) (10Alterio J. Ravassard P. Haavik J. Le Caer J. Faucon-Biguet N. Waksman G. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) byNdeI-BamHI digestion. The fragment was blunted by Klenow polymerase and transferred into the SmaI restriction site of PGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This plasmid permits the production of HTH3 fused to Schistosoma japonicum GST. A sequence encoding the corresponding isoform of HTH but lacking exon 3 (HTHΔ3) was obtained by deletion of exon 3 from PGEX-2T-HTH3 as described in Lanièce et al. (17Lanièce P. Le Hir H. Bodeau-Péan S. Charon Y. Valentin L. Thermes C. Mallet J. Dumas S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1819-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, two amplification products of the sequences corresponding to HTH exons 1 + 2 and exons 4 + 5 were joined by polymerase chain reaction, and the final amplification product was used to replace the HTH3 sequence between the BamHI and XhoI sites in PGEX-2T-HTH3. The primers used were (i°) ccataatggatccATGCCCACCCCCGACGCC (capital letters, HTH sequence beginning with initiator codon; bold,BamHI site) and GCTTCAAACGT–CTTGGGGTGGG (junction exon2-exon 4, antisense) and (ii°) CCACCCCAAG–ACGTTTGAAGC (junction exon2 -exon 4, sense) and CGGGTGGTCCAAGTCCAG (within exon 5). The PET3a-HTHΔ3 construct was obtained from PET3a-HTH3 by deletion of the third exon using the same method. All amplified sequences were checked by sequencing. PGEX-2T-HTH3 and -HTHΔ3 constructions were introduced into electrocompetent AX90Escherichia coli cells. Production of the fusion proteins (GST-HTH3 and GST-HTHΔ3) was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with minor modifications. E. coli cells were harvested at 25 °C instead of 37 °C to avoid formation of inclusion bodies. After elution from the glutathione-agarose beads, fusion proteins were extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, then to desalt, concentrate, and eliminate low molecular weight protein contaminants, fusion proteins were centrifuged on Microcon-100 microconcentrators (Amicon, 100-kDa molecular mass cut-off columns). Protein purity was confirmed by electrophoresis on a 9% polyacrylamide denaturing gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The protein quantities were first estimated with the Bradford method, then precisely measured by comparing the intensity of the Coomassie Blue-stained band to a standard curve obtained with bovine serum albumin (Image 1.59 software). GST-HTH3 and -HTHΔ3 enzymatic activities were tested by a radioenzymatic assay as described in Alterio et al. (10Alterio J. Ravassard P. Haavik J. Le Caer J. Faucon-Biguet N. Waksman G. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the enzymatic activities were measured as the release of tritiated water from l-[3H]tyrosine at 30 °C in 0.1m Hepes, pH 7, 40 μm tyrosine, 0.5 mg/ml catalase, 0.1 mm FeSO4, 0.32 μCi ofl-[3H]tyrosine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following addition of the cofactor BH4 (250 to 3000 μm) diluted in 20 mm dithiothreitol. Fusion proteins were diluted before activity assay in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7, containing 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. Each activity was measured in triplicate, and further experiments were performed with several independant enzyme batches. We first established the initial velocity conditions in which the activity increases linearly with time and enzyme quantity. Using different BH4 concentrations (from 250 to 3000 μm), Lineweaver-Burk curves were then traced for both isoforms with the Kaleidagraph software. The experimental results were fitted for the inhibition by excess of BH4 substrate (10Alterio J. Ravassard P. Haavik J. Le Caer J. Faucon-Biguet N. Waksman G. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with the following equation:V = V m/(K m + [BH4] + [BH4]2/K i), according to Dixon and Webb (18Dixon M. Webb E. Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Longmans Group UK Ltd., London1964: 81-85Google Scholar), where V m is the maximal velocity of the enzyme, K m is the apparent Michaelis constant for BH4, and K i the inhibition constant for BH4. To analyze the regulation of GST-HTH3 and -HTHΔ3 by polyanions, heparin (Calciparine Sanofi, France) was added to the assay mix (5 to 15 IU) before the addition of BH4 (500 μm). Similarly, final product retroinhibition was tested by the addition of dopamine (3-hydroxytyramin; Sigma) (10 to 100 μm) to the reaction before the addition of BH4 (500 μm). The inhibition constant for dopamine (K i) was determined graphically for both isoforms by plotting 1/V as a function of dopamine concentration for 3 different BH4 concentrations (250, 500, and 1000 μm). The point of intersection of the 3 lines givesK i directly (Dixon method, see Ref. 18Dixon M. Webb E. Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Longmans Group UK Ltd., London1964: 81-85Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the 59 first amino acids of the third exon of HTH was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides ccataatggatccCGGTTCATTGGGCGCAGG and ccacaatgaatCCTCGGGGAGAAGAGCAG, purified, digested, and introduced between the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amplified products were checked by sequencing. The GST-HTHexon3 fusion protein was produced in AX90 cells and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol and sent to Eurogentec (Ougrée, Belgium) for antiserum production in rabbits. The anti-HTHexon 3 antiserum was purified by affinity using the GST-HTHexon3 antigen immobilized on Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using standard methods. The immunoreactivity and specificity of this antibody was checked by Western blotting experiments with total lysate from BL21 bacteria (Stratagene) transformed with PET-3a-HTH1 and PET-3a-HTHΔ3. Frozen post-mortem human adrenal glands from controls and PSP patients were obtained from the brain bank of Inserm U 289 (Hôpital de la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Paris) and from Dr. P. F. Plouin (Hôpital Broussais, Paris). PSP was clinically characterized, and the diagnosis was confirmed as described in Dumaset al. (5Dumas S. Le Hir H. Bodeau-Péan S. Hirsch E. Thermes C. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Tissues were lyzed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride; Sigma) and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The total protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford method. Western blotting experiments were performed by standard procedures with an anti-RTH polyclonal antibody provided by Dr. J. F. Reinhard (19Haykal-Coates N. O'Callaghan J. Reinhard Jr., J.F. Jensen K.F. Brain Res. 1991; 556: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and 125I-protein A. The membrane was stripped in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, 0.05% Tween 20 at 80 °C and reprobed with the anti-HTHexon3-purified antiserum. The amount of the HTHΔ3 isoform in the adrenal samples was estimated with the Image 1.59 software. To test human tissues for the presence of an HTH protein isoform lacking exon 3, we raised and purified an antiserum against the third exon of HTH. We ascertained the immunoreactivity and specificity of affinity-purified anti-HTHexon3 antibodies by Western blotting experiments with HTHΔ3 (containing exons 1a,2,4–14) and HTH1 (containing exons 1a,3,4–14) produced in E. coli by the PET-3a expression system. As expected, this anti-HTHexon 3 antibody only recognized the HTH1 isoform (Fig.1 B), whereas a polyclonal anti-RTH antibody (19Haykal-Coates N. O'Callaghan J. Reinhard Jr., J.F. Jensen K.F. Brain Res. 1991; 556: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) recognized both HTH isoforms (Fig.1 A), attesting to the specificity of the anti-HTHexon3 antibody. Then, to determine the expression profile of the HTHΔ3 isoform in human tissues, total protein extracts from control and PSP adrenal medullas were probed with both antibodies by Western blotting experiments. Recombinant HTH proteins expressed from the PET-3A system in E. coli were used as size controls. With the polyclonal anti-rat TH antibody (19Haykal-Coates N. O'Callaghan J. Reinhard Jr., J.F. Jensen K.F. Brain Res. 1991; 556: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), several bands were detected in these tissue samples (Fig. 2 A). The two slower migrating bands correspond, respectively, to HTH 3 and 4 and HTH 1 and 2, as described previously (20Haycock J.W. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two other isoforms of approximately 55 and 50 kDa were found in all tissue samples; they were also detected in a noncatecholaminergic rat cell line (ST14A) stably transfected with HTH1-cDNA, showing that were not the result of alternative splicing. Interestingly, as seen on Fig. 2 A, the polyclonal anti-rat TH antibody detected a novel protein of the same size as recombinant HTHΔ3 in the PSP adrenal medulla sample. To confirm the identity of this isoform, the membrane was stripped and reincubated with the anti-HTHexon3 antibody (Fig. 2 B). The novel protein was not recognized by this antibody, evidencing that it lacks exon 3 and is certainly HTHΔ3. This isoform is present in a substantial amount in PSP adrenal medulla and is present in much lower amounts in normal adrenal medullas (Fig. 2). To analyze the involvement of exon 3 in HTH enzymatic activity, the cDNAs encoding HTHΔ3 and HTH3 (the equivalent isoform containing exon 3) were inserted into PGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), allowing the synthesis of GST fusion proteins. Both GST-HTHΔ3 and GST-HTH3 fusion proteins were produced and purified from total bacterial lysate on an affinity column. The integrity and purity of both fusion proteins were ascertained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.3). The activities of the recombinant GST-HTH proteins were measured by a radioenzymatic activity assay. The absence of activity presented by GST alone in this assay was ascertained (data not shown). The initial velocity conditions in which product formation increases linearly with time and enzyme concentration were determined (Fig. 4), and all further experiments were performed in the following conditions: 50 ng of fusion protein, 5 min reaction time. The GST-HTH activities were measured with various BH4 concentrations from 400 to 3000 μm, and the Lineweaver-Burk plots were traced, showing typical excess substrate inhibition (Fig. 5). The kinetic parameters were calculated according to the classical analysis of substrate inhibition kinetics, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The maximal velocities of GST-HTH3 and -HTHΔ3 were, respectively, 1400 (±70) and 450 (± 40) pmols of DOPA/min/μg of enzyme, which shows that GST-HTHΔ3 has approximately 30% GST-HTH3 maximal velocity. The absence of exon 3 did not significantly change the Michaëlis constant (K m) of the enzyme for the cofactor BH4 (174 ± 24 μm for GST-HTH3, 180 ± 50 μm for GST-HTHΔ3) nor the inhibition constant (K i) for BH4 (4100 ± 500 μm for GST-HTH3, 2800 ± 500 μm for GST-HTHΔ3).Figure 4Enzymatic activity of GST-HTH3 and GST-HTHΔ3 fusion proteins: initial velocity conditions. TH activity was measured with 25 to 100 ng of purified fusion protein by a radioenzymatic assay usingl-[3H]tyrosine as described under “Experimental Procedures” with various incubation times. The activity is expressed as pmols of DOPA according to the radioactive counts. A, pmols of DOPA increase linearly with time for both isoforms; B, the slopes of the curves obtained inA were plotted against enzyme quantity, showing that pmols of DOPA/min increases linearly with the amount of enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Lineweaver-Burk plots for GST-HTH3 and GST-HTHΔ3. The enzymatic activities of both forms were measured with a series of quantities of BH4 ranging from 400 to 3000 μm. The inhibition by high BH4 concentrations described in Alterio et al. (10Alterio J. Ravassard P. Haavik J. Le Caer J. Faucon-Biguet N. Waksman G. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was observed. The curves were fitted by Kaleidagraph software according to Dixon and Webb (18Dixon M. Webb E. Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Longmans Group UK Ltd., London1964: 81-85Google Scholar), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” micro, microgram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HTH enzymatic activity is tightly controlled in vivo, subject to down-regulation by catecholamines as the end products of the biosynthetic chain, and activated by phosphorylation and polyanion binding (1Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Because retroinhibition by catecholamines is one of the major mechanisms for controlling TH activity, we tested the effect of exon 3 skipping on the regulation of HTH activity by dopamine. Both GST-HTH3 and GST-HTHΔ3 activities were analyzed with different concentrations of dopamine from 10 to 100 μm. As seen on Fig. 6 B, GST-HTH3 was more strongly inhibited; its activity was reduced to 50% in the presence of 10 μm dopamine, whereas GST-HTHΔ3 was only decreased by 10%. To further characterize the kinetic parameters of the inhibition of GST-HTH proteins by dopamine, we measured GST-HTH3 and -HTHΔ3 activities at various dopamine concentrations in the presence of three different quantities of BH4 (Fig. 7). We graphically determined the inhibition constant (K i) of both GST-HTH isoforms for dopamine according to the Dixon method (18Dixon M. Webb E. Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Longmans Group UK Ltd., London1964: 81-85Google Scholar). The calculated K i for dopamine was increased from 1 to 10 μm by skipping exon 3, demonstrating that the exon 3 is implicated in the retroinhibition of TH by dopamine.Figure 7Inhibition constant (K i) of GST-HTH3 and GST-HTHΔ3 for dopamine. TH activity of GST-HTH3 (top) and GST-HTHΔ3 (bottom) was assayed in the presence of 4 different amounts of the cofactor BH4 (250, 500, 750, and 1000 μm) after preincubation with various concentrations of dopamine (from 0 to 25 μm). Plots were traced by expressing 1/V as a function of dopamine concentration for the 4 different BH4 concentrations. The intersection of the 4 curves directly gives the inhibition constant (K i) for dopamine, according to the Dixon method (18Dixon M. Webb E. Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Longmans Group UK Ltd., London1964: 81-85Google Scholar). micro, microgram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also studied the effect of exon 3 skipping on the activation of HTH by heparin. GST-HTHΔ3 and -HTH3 activities were measured in the presence of a series of concentrations of heparin (Fig. 6 A). GST-HTH3 activity increased gradually with heparin concentration (up to 20%), whereas no significant activation of GST-HTHΔ3 was observed, strongly implicating exon 3 in the activation of HTH by heparin. Altogether these observations provide the first demonstration that exon 3 is implicated in the HTH overall catalytic activity and, most importantly, in the regulation of HTH activity by polyanions and by catecholamines. A great diversity of mechanisms controlling TH activity has been described, and among these, alternative splicing of HTH pre-mRNA is thought to be significant (25Nagatsu T. Essays Biochem. 1995; 30: 15-35PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we evidenced the presence in adrenal medulla of a novel HTH isoform, HTHΔ3, that lacks the third exon comprising two major phosphorylation sites, Ser31 and Ser40. This isoform corresponds to the translation of a previously unsuspected HTH mRNA generated by alternative splicing recently identified in adrenal medulla and overexpressed in adrenals of patients suffering from PSP, a neurodegenerative disease affecting predominantly catecholaminergic neurons of the basal ganglia (5Dumas S. Le Hir H. Bodeau-Péan S. Hirsch E. Thermes C. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also established that the exon 3 participates in the regulation of HTH enzymatic activity in vitro. The presence of an HTH protein isoform lacking the third exon in vivo was evidenced by Western blotting experiments. This HTH isoform, having the size of recombinant HTHΔ3, was not recognized by an antibody specifically raised against HTH exon 3, whereas it was clearly detected by a polyclonal antibody directed against whole rat TH recognizing all HTH isoforms. This protein isoform was clearly detected in PSP adrenal medulla and was about six times less abundant in control adrenal medullas. Substantial amounts of the novel isoform were also found in all other PSP adrenals tested (data not shown), in accordance with the higher levels of HTHΔ3 mRNA previously observed in PSP adrenals (5Dumas S. Le Hir H. Bodeau-Péan S. Hirsch E. Thermes C. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This variable expression of the HTHΔ3 isoform indicate that alternative splicing of HTH exon 3 may be significant. The increased amount of HTHΔ3 in PSP suggests that the splicing alteration may be a cause of the disease. This schema involving a poorly expressed truncated enzyme isoform generated by alternative splicing has already been proposed by Hirano et al (42Hirano M. Tamaru Y. Nagai Y. Ito H. Imai T. Ueno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Indeed, some familial patients with DOPA-responsive dystonia have been shown to express a small proportion of incorrectly spliced mRNA encoding GTP-cyclohydrolase I (the limiting enzyme in the synthesis of BH4), and the amount correlates with the severity of the symptoms. Because several familial cases of PSP have been described (39De Yebenes J.G. Sarasa J.L. Daniel S.E. Lees A.J. Brain. 1995; 118: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we searched by sequencing for mutations at exon 3 splice junctions within HTH gene on genomic DNA extracted from the cerebellum of 10 PSP patients. Among these, only three adrenal medullas were available, and they show an expression of the HTHΔ3 protein (data not shown). No mutation was found in a region of 100 bases around the donor and acceptor splice junctions of exon 3 (data not shown),"
