https://openalex.org/W2761784274,"Detection of cytosolic DNA constitutes a central event in the context of numerous infectious and sterile inflammatory conditions. Recent studies have uncovered a bipartite mode of cytosolic DNA recognition, in which the cGAS-STING axis triggers antiviral immunity, whereas AIM2 triggers inflammasome activation. Here, we show that AIM2 is dispensable for DNA-mediated inflammasome activation in human myeloid cells. Instead, detection of cytosolic DNA by the cGAS-STING axis induces a cell death program initiating potassium efflux upstream of NLRP3. Forward genetics identified regulators of lysosomal trafficking to modulate this cell death program, and subsequent studies revealed that activated STING traffics to the lysosome, where it triggers membrane permeabilization and thus lysosomal cell death (LCD). Importantly, the cGAS-STING-NLRP3 pathway constitutes the default inflammasome response during viral and bacterial infections in human myeloid cells. We conclude that targeting the cGAS-STING-LCD-NLRP3 pathway will ameliorate pathology in inflammatory conditions that are associated with cytosolic DNA sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2763478649,"Progenitor cells differentiate into specialized cell types through coordinated expression of lineage-specific genes and modification of complex chromatin configurations. We demonstrate that a histone deacetylase (Hdac3) organizes heterochromatin at the nuclear lamina during cardiac progenitor lineage restriction. Specification of cardiomyocytes is associated with reorganization of peripheral heterochromatin, and independent of deacetylase activity, Hdac3 tethers peripheral heterochromatin containing lineage-relevant genes to the nuclear lamina. Deletion of Hdac3 in cardiac progenitor cells releases genomic regions from the nuclear periphery, leading to precocious cardiac gene expression and differentiation into cardiomyocytes; in contrast, restricting Hdac3 to the nuclear periphery rescues myogenesis in progenitors otherwise lacking Hdac3. Our results suggest that availability of genomic regions for activation by lineage-specific factors is regulated in part through dynamic chromatin-nuclear lamina interactions and that competence of a progenitor cell to respond to differentiation signals may depend upon coordinated movement of responding gene loci away from the nuclear periphery."

In human mitochondria, the process of replication of mtDNA is directly linked to transcription (Asin-Cayuela and Gustafsson, 2007Asin-Cayuela J. Gustafsson C.M.

In the absence of a dedicated mitochondrial primase, replication primers are generated by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAP), a single subunit enzyme that resembles phage RNAPs (Gustafsson et al., 2016Gustafsson C.M.

The early replication events in human mitochondria require assembly of the transcription initiation complex at the light strand promoter (LSP) (Morozov et al., 2015Morozov Y.I. Parshin A.V.

This termination event is triggered by a conserved G-rich sequence, called CSBII, which is located near the replication origin OriH and encodes a short G-quadruplex structure (Wanrooij et al., 2010Wanrooij P.H. Uhler J.P. Simonsson T. Falkenberg M. Gustafsson C.M. G-quadruplex structures in RNA stimulate mitochondrial transcription termination and primer formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Recently, a mitochondrial transcription elongation factor, TEFM, was shown to efficiently prevent termination at CSBII (Agaronyan et al., 2015Agaronyan K. Morozov Y.I. Anikin M. Temiakov D.

TEFM is a potent stimulator of mitochondrial transcription elongation in vitro.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TEFM is a processivity factor required for synthesis of long, near genome-size polycistronic transcripts by the otherwise non-processive mtRNAP (Agaronyan et al., 2015Agaronyan K. Morozov Y.I.

It has been suggested that TEFM can serve as a key regulator involved in the molecular switch. TEFM would regulate whether a mitochondrial nucleoid undergoes replication (in the absence of TEFM) or transcription (in the presence of TEFM) and help to avoid head-on collisions between the replisome and the elongating mtRNAP (Agaronyan et al., 2015Agaronyan K. Morozov Y.I. Anikin M. Temiakov D. Mitochondrial biology. Replication-transcription switch in human mitochondria.Science. 2015; 347: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this work, we present the atomic structures of human TEFM domains and define their roles in transcription elongation and anti-termination at the CSBII site. We have also determined the structure of the functionally relevant TEFM C-terminal domain bound to the elongation complex (EC) of mtRNAP, which explains how TEFM enhances transcription processivity. These structural data together with the functional experiments and cross-linking analysis suggest the mechanisms that TEFM exploits to regulate transcription elongation and anti-termination. Our initial crystallization trials did not produce crystals of full-length TEFM. Sequence-based homology prediction suggested that human TEFM contains at least two regions with distinct structural organization (Minczuk et al., 2011Minczuk M. He J. Duch A.M. Ettema T.J. Chlebowski A. Dzionek K. Nijtmans L.G. Huynen M.A. Holt I.J. TEFM (c17orf42) is necessary for transcription of human mtDNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 4284-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), possibly interspersed by less well-ordered domains (Figure 1A). Protease treatment is known to improve chances of crystallization of proteins with flexible regions (Dong et al., 2007Dong A. Xu X. Edwards A.M. Chang C. Chruszcz M. Cuff M. Cymborowski M. Di Leo R.

Methods. 2007; 4: 1019-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We therefore probed whether TEFM contains unstructured regions that may interfere with its crystallization by using limited proteolysis with trypsin, LysC and ArgC proteases. These experiments revealed two stable regions representing the N-terminal domain (NTD, ∼10 kDa) and the C-terminal domain (CTD, ∼26 kDa) of TEFM, while the region between these domains (the inter-domain linker) was sensitive to proteolysis (Figure S1A).Figure S1Domain Organization of TEFM, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Limited proteolysis of TEFM.

Limited proteolysis of TEFM with ArgC prior to crystallization yielded large well-diffracting crystals of the CTD. The structure was subsequently solved at 1.9 Å resolution by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) using selenomethionine-labeled protein (Table S1; Figures S1B and S1C). The TEFM CTD crystals belong to space group C2 and contain four molecules in the asymmetric unit with only minor differences between the individual molecules (Cα root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] <1 Å over 200 residues). To obtain the crystal structure of the TEFM NTD, we expressed this domain separately and obtained large, rod-like crystals of space group P43212 containing one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure of the NTD was solved at a resolution of 1.3 Å using the anomalous signal of the naturally occurring sulfur atoms (native-SAD) (Table S1; Figure S1D). The crystal structures of the NTD and the CTD were refined to free R-factors of 19.7 and 22.8, respectively, and both showed excellent stereo chemical quality (Table S1). In the two crystal forms, we observed interpretable electron density for residues 57–134 (NTD) and residues 153–356 (CTD), which comprise 87% of the full-length, mature TEFM (Table S1). Our structures lack 21 N-terminal residues, three C-terminal residues, and a 19-amino acid linker region, which connects the two domains. The linker contains six lysine and two arginine residues and appears to be disordered in the CTD structure. The TEFM CTD forms a dimeric assembly of monomers containing an RNase H-like fold that is characteristic of members of the Holliday junction resolvase family of enzymes (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1B) (Wyatt and West, 2014Wyatt H.D. West S.C. Holliday junction resolvases.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2014; 6: a023192Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This family includes a large number of RuvC-like resolvases from bacteria, viruses, and mitochondria (Ariyoshi et al., 1994Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K.

Holliday junction resolvase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe has identical endonuclease activity to the CCE1 homologue YDC2.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Structural alignment suggests that the closest structural homolog to the TEFM CTD is Schizosaccharomyces pombe mitochondrial Holliday junction resolvase, Cce1 (Ydc2) (Ceschini et al., 2001Ceschini S. Keeley A. McAlister M.S. Oram M. Phelan J. Pearl L.H. Tsaneva I.R. Barrett T.E. Crystal structure of the fission yeast mitochondrial Holliday junction resolvase Ydc2.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6601-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). While TEFM and Cce1 share little in sequence homology, the structures contain a common core fold consisting of five β strands and four C-terminal helices (Figures 1D and S1B). Compared to Cce1, TEFM lacks a protruding three-helix region, and two N-terminal helices and two loops (α12-α13; α13-α14) are expanded (Figure 1D) (Sigala and Tsaneva, 2003Sigala B. Tsaneva I.R. Functional dissection of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Holliday junction resolvase Ydc2: In vivo role in mitochondrial DNA maintenance.Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2837-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Similar to Cce1, dimerization of the TEFM CTD is mediated by a hydrophobic interface mainly formed by a contact between the α10 helices (residues 244–266) from the two CTD monomers. A unique feature of TEFM, not observed thus far in any related bacterial or mitochondrial Holliday junction resolvase, is the presence of a compact globular NTD (Figure 1B). The structure of the NTD reveals that this domain adopts a tandem helix-hairpin-helix fold ([HhH]2) found in a number of DNA binding proteins. HhH domains have been implicated in non-sequence-specific double stranded DNA binding and have been found in bacterial and eukaryotic transcription factors and other DNA binding proteins (Close et al., 2011Close D. Johnson S.J. Sdano M.A. McDonald S.M. Robinson H. Formosa T. Hill C.P. Crystal structures of the S. cerevisiae Spt6 core and C-terminal tandem SH2 domain.J. Mol.

Crystal structure and RNA binding of the Tex protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1460-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although lacking apparent sequence homology, the TEFM NTD superimposes well with the HhH domain of the bacterial Tex protein (Cα RMSD = 1.4 Å over 56 residues, PDB: 3BZC) (Figure 1E). Taken together, TEFM exhibits a previously unseen combination of distinct structural domains—the Holliday junction resolvase-like CTD core flanked by two globular HhH domains. TEFM has been previously implicated in anti-termination activity and was shown to affect mtRNAP stability and processivity (Agaronyan et al., 2015Agaronyan K. Morozov Y.I. Anikin M. Temiakov D.

Hällberg B.M. Gustafsson C.M. TEFM is a potent stimulator of mitochondrial transcription elongation in vitro.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine the functional role of TEFM domains in these activities, we constructed variants representing the CTD alone (Δ159 TEFM, residues 160–360), the CTD with a part of the linker (Δ144 TEFM, residues 145–360), and the CTD with the linker (Δ135 TEFM, residues 136–360) (Figure 2A). In the anti-termination assay, transcription of template DNA containing the CSBII region results in termination of RNA synthesis by mtRNAP in the absence of TEFM, whereas its addition results in accumulation of run-off products (Figure 2B, lanes 1–4). We found that the NTD of TEFM is not required for anti-termination activity (Figure 2B, lanes 5–7). Removal of ten amino acids of the linker along with the NTD results in significant loss of anti-termination activity (Figure 2B, lanes 8–10), while deletion of the entire linker subdomain abolished anti-termination (Figure 2B, lanes 11–13). TEFM variants containing single or multiple substitutions in the linker were defective to various extents in anti-termination activity, and substitution of amino acid residues 149–153 resulted in loss of activity (Figures 2C and 2D). We therefore conclude that the inter-domain linker is required for anti-termination activity of TEFM. We next analyzed which part of TEFM affects its ability to stabilize the EC (Figure 2E). In this assay, ECs are halted 35 bp downstream of a promoter (in the absence of CTP) for 60 min prior to a “chase” to run-off transcription. In the absence of TEFM, halted ECs are not stable and accumulation of 35-mer RNA product is observed (Figure 2E, lane 1). Addition of TEFM, however, results in stabilization of the EC, prevents high mtRNAP turnover and, consequently, causes nearly complete extension of 35 nt RNA to run-off (Figure 2E, lanes 2 and 3). As in the experiments described above, deletion of the NTD did not affect TEFM stabilization activity (Figure 2E, lanes 4 and 5), while loss of both NTD and inter-domain linker rendered TEFM incapable of EC stabilization (Figure 2E, lanes 6 and 7). Finally, we examined whether the TEFM variants were able to support mtRNAP processivity on long templates (Figure 2F). In the absence of TEFM, mtRNAP is not able to produce detectable 4,000-nt-long run-off RNA products. In contrast, run-off synthesis was observed in the presence of TEFM or TEFM variants lacking the NTD (Figure 2F, lanes 2 and 3). In the presence of TEFM CTD, mtRNAP was still able to generate long RNA transcripts, suggesting that the CTD, even without the inter-domain linker, is sufficient for stimulating processivity (Figure 2F, lane 4). To obtain the crystal structure of an anti-termination complex, in which elongating mtRNAP is bound to TEFM, we first defined the topology of the nucleic acid scaffold in the EC by RNase I and DNase I footprinting (Figure 3A). In the absence of TEFM, no clear RNA footprint was detected, likely due to the relative instability of the halted ECs. In contrast, in the presence of TEFM, a distinct footprint of about 19 nt of protected RNA was observed suggesting that TEFM stabilizes the EC by interacting with the 5′ end of the exiting transcript (Figure 3A). Removal of the NTD did not significantly alter the TEFM footprint, identifying the CTD and the linker domain as primary RNA-interacting regions (Figures S2A and S2B).Figure S2TEFM Interacts with RNA and DNA in the EC, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) TEFM lacking the NTD domain protects 19-20 nt of RNA from RNase 1 cleavage in the anti-termination complex.

TEFM has previously been shown to interact with the DNA in the EC (Agaronyan et al., 2015Agaronyan K. Morozov Y.I. Anikin M. Temiakov D. Mitochondrial biology. Replication-transcription switch in human mitochondria.Science. 2015; 347: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine the TEFM footprint on DNA, we assembled ECs using an RNA-DNA scaffold and probed TEFM protection by DNase I (Figure 3B). In the presence of TEFM, the protected region was significantly larger than for the EC alone and included about 12 bp of upstream DNA and 14 bp of downstream DNA (Figures 3B and 3C). We did not detect any changes in DNA protection when the Δ135 TEFM variant was used, suggesting that the NTD does not strongly associate with DNA (Figure S2C). However, the TEFM variant lacking both NTD and the linker did not produce a clear DNA footprint (Figure S2D). Overall, binding of TEFM to the EC significantly increases the region of nucleic acid protection (Figure 3C), consistent with our previous findings (Agaronyan et al., 2015Agaronyan K. Morozov Y.I. Anikin M. Temiakov D. Mitochondrial biology. Replication-transcription switch in human mitochondria.Science. 2015; 347: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To crystallize the anti-termination complex, we used the Δ135 variant of TEFM, which is fully functional in anti-termination assays, and Δ150 mtRNAP assembled into an EC on an RNA-DNA scaffold derived from the footprinting experiments above. Crystals of the EC-TEFM complex belonged to space group C2, contained two copies of the EC-TEFM complex in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to 3.9 Å resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and could be refined to a free R-factor of 27.6% (Table S2; STAR Methods). The structure revealed that the TEFM CTD dimer forms an extensive network of interactions with all components of the EC by binding mtRNAP at the open side of the RNA-DNA hybrid cavity (Figures 4A and 4B ). The primary point of interaction between mtRNAP and TEFM is the intercalating hairpin (Figure 4C), a mobile element in the NTD of mtRNAP involved in separation of RNA from the RNA-DNA hybrid and thus maintenance of the trailing edge of the transcription bubble (Schwinghammer et al., 2013Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1298-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two invariant aromatic residues in the intercalating hairpin, Y610 and F612, and the conserved residue Q617 project into a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of TEFM, the walls of which are formed by helices adjacent to the β strand core (Figure 4C). The structure of the EC-TEFM complex reveals that the homodimeric form of TEFM observed in the CTD crystals also occurs when TEFM is bound to mtRNAP (Figures 4A and 4B). To investigate whether dimerization of TEFM is required for its activity, we modified the hydrophobic interface between the TEFM monomers to prevent their association by substituting five residues in the α10 helix (Figure S3A). In contrast to the wild-type TEFM, the resulting protein eluted as a monomer during size exclusion chromatography and did not bind to the EC (Figure S3B). No anti-termination activity was observed with the mutant monomeric TEFM, confirming that dimerization of TEFM is required for its activity (Figure S3C). TEFM makes extensive interactions (∼1,000 Å2) with the downstream DNA duplex of the EC. The positively charged surface of one of the TEFM monomers covers the otherwise exposed DNA and along with mtRNAP sequesters it in a fashion resembling the DNA “clamping” observed in multi-subunit eukaryotic and bacterial RNAPs (Figures 4D, S4A, and S4B). This clamping may explain the stabilization and higher processivity of ECs in the presence of TEFM (Agaronyan et al., 2015Agaronyan K. Morozov Y.I. Anikin M. Temiakov D. Mitochondrial biology. Replication-transcription switch in human mitochondria.Science. 2015; 347: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The positively charged TEFM surface extends to the other monomer contributing to a much smaller interaction surface with the upstream than with the downstream DNA (Figures S4A and S4B). Consequently, the electron density for the downstream DNA duplex was strong, whereas the density for the upstream DNA duplex was weaker due to higher conformational flexibility (Figure S4C). Furthermore, we observed difference density corresponding to the single-stranded region of the DNA non-template strand in the transcription bubble, which wraps around the opposite side of the dimer axis of TEFM formed by the α10 helices (Figure S4C). This region of the DNA was invisible in the previous structure of the EC (Schwinghammer et al., 2013Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1298-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) due to conformational flexibility but seems to be stabilized in the EC-TEFM complex. However, we refrained from modeling it due to the limited resolution of the complex structure. Thus, in addition to interacting with the downstream DNA, TEFM also stabilizes the EC by sequestering the single-stranded portion of the non-template strand of DNA (Figure 4D). Although visible only partially in the EC-TEFM structure, both inter-domain linkers of TEFM are located in close proximity to the DNA suggesting that the NTDs of TEFM may reside near or at the downstream and upstream duplexes (Figure 4D). Thus, it is plausible that the positively charged residues in the linker contribute additional interaction points with the upstream and downstream DNA, thereby anchoring TEFM to the EC (Figure 4D). This could be important for the anti-termination activity because binding of TEFM to the EC must outwe"
https://openalex.org/W2764342258,"Polyphenols are a class of bioactive plant secondary metabolites that are thought to have beneficial effects on gut health, such as modulation of mucosal immune and inflammatory responses and regulation of parasite burdens. Here, we examined the interactions between a polyphenol-rich diet supplement and infection with the enteric nematode Ascaris suum in pigs. Pigs were fed either a basal diet or the same diet supplemented with grape pomace (GP), an industrial by-product rich in polyphenols such as oligomeric proanthocyanidins. Half of the animals in each group were then inoculated with A. suum for 14 days to assess parasite establishment, acquisition of local and systemic immune responses and effects on the gut microbiome. Despite in vitro anthelmintic activity of GP-extracts, numbers of parasite larvae in the intestine were not altered by GP-supplementation. However, the bioactive diet significantly increased numbers of eosinophils induced by A. suum infection in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, and modulated gene expression in the jejunal mucosa of infected pigs. Both GP-supplementation and A. suum infection induced significant and apparently similar changes in the composition of the prokaryotic gut microbiota, and both also decreased concentrations of isobutyric and isovaleric acid (branched-chain short chain fatty acids) in the colon. Our results demonstrate that while a polyphenol-enriched diet in pigs may not directly influence A. suum establishment, it significantly modulates the subsequent host response to helminth infection. Our results suggest an influence of diet on immune function which may potentially be exploited to enhance immunity to helminths."
https://openalex.org/W2762265991,"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but the pathophysiology is poorly understood. Imbalances in the enteric microbiome have been associated with ASD and can cause GI dysfunction potentially through disruption of mitochondrial function as microbiome metabolites modulate mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dysfunction is highly associated with GI symptoms. In this study, we compared mitochondrial function in rectal and cecum biopsies under the assumption that certain microbiome metabolites, such as butyrate and propionic acid, are more abundant in the cecum as compared to the rectum. Rectal and cecum mucosal biopsies were collected during elective diagnostic colonoscopy. Using a single-blind case-control design, complex I and IV and citrate synthase activities and complex I-V protein quantity from 10 children with ASD, 10 children with Crohn's disease and 10 neurotypical children with nonspecific GI complaints were measured. The protein for all complexes, except complex II, in the cecum as compared to the rectum was significantly higher in ASD samples as compared to other groups. For both rectal and cecum biopsies, ASD samples demonstrated higher complex I activity, but not complex IV or citrate synthase activity, compared to other groups. Mitochondrial function in the gut mucosa from children with ASD was found to be significantly different than other groups who manifested similar GI symptomatology suggesting a unique pathophysiology for GI symptoms in children with ASD. Abnormalities localized to the cecum suggest a role for imbalances in the microbiome, potentially in the production of butyrate, in children with ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2763014033,"The temperature dependence of biological processes has been studied at the levels of individual biochemical reactions and organism physiology (e.g. basal metabolic rates) but has not been examined at the metabolic network level. Here, we used a systems biology approach to characterize the temperature dependence of the human red blood cell (RBC) metabolic network between 4 and 37 °C through absolutely quantified exo- and endometabolomics data. We used an Arrhenius-type model (Q10) to describe how the rate of a biochemical process changes with every 10 °C change in temperature. Multivariate statistical analysis of the metabolomics data revealed that the same metabolic network-level trends previously reported for RBCs at 4 °C were conserved but accelerated with increasing temperature. We calculated a median Q10 coefficient of 2.89 ± 1.03, within the expected range of 2–3 for biological processes, for 48 individual metabolite concentrations. We then integrated these metabolomics measurements into a cell-scale metabolic model to study pathway usage, calculating a median Q10 coefficient of 2.73 ± 0.75 for 35 reaction fluxes. The relative fluxes through glycolysis and nucleotide metabolism pathways were consistent across the studied temperature range despite the non-uniform distributions of Q10 coefficients of individual metabolites and reaction fluxes. Together, these results indicate that the rate of change of network-level responses to temperature differences in RBC metabolism is consistent between 4 and 37 °C. More broadly, we provide a baseline characterization of a biochemical network given no transcriptional or translational regulation that can be used to explore the temperature dependence of metabolism.

If Q10 = 2 for a given process, then the rate of that process increases by a factor of 2 for every 10 °C increase in temperature. The Q10 can be calculated from the slope of a rate versus temperature plot, which is approximately linear over the biologically relevant temperature range of 0–40 °C (7Gillooly J.F. Brown J.H.

Changes at the physiological level depend on more than changes in the underlying individual biochemical reaction rates (11Chaui-Berlinck J.G. Monteiro L.H. Navas C.A. Bicudo J.E.

Why does metabolism scale with temperature?.Funct. Ecol. 2004; 18: 243-251Crossref Scopus (406) Google Scholar). For instance, various regulatory mechanisms (e.g. transcriptional, post-translational, and allosteric) determine how cells respond to temperature shock (13Al-Fageeh M.B. Smales C.M. Control and regulation of the cellular responses to cold shock: the responses in yeast and mammalian systems.Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The existence of extra layers of regulation complicates the effects of temperature change on the biochemical network. Biology is inherently multiscale, and the gap between observing the temperature dependence at the scale of an individual reaction and at the physiological level can be addressed through methods of systems biology (14Schulte P.M. The effects of temperature on aerobic metabolism: towards a mechanistic understanding of the responses of ectotherms to a changing environment.J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218: 1856-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Red blood cells (RBCs) represent an ideal cell type to study the temperature dependence of network-level metabolic biochemistry because of the absence of a nucleus and genetic material. This absence results in a lack of complicated transcriptional or translational regulation on metabolic enzyme activity. Allosteric and other regulation of enzymatic reaction rates is still present in RBCs, representing enzyme kinetic mechanisms and thus direct biochemical functions. In this study, we investigated the temperature dependence of metabolism in the RBC at the network level by examining the rate of change of metabolite concentrations and metabolic reactions rates. We measured exo- and endometabolomics profiles in human RBCs stored at four different temperatures that span the range between the ex vivo (storage) and in vivo (body) temperatures: 4, 13, 22, and 37 °C. We regressed the concentration profile of each metabolite across the measured temperature range to calculate its Q10 value. We integrated these measurements with a cell-scale network reconstruction of RBC metabolism (15Bordbar A. Jamshidi N. Palsson B.O. iAB-RBC-283: a proteomically derived knowledge-base of erythrocyte metabolism that can be used to simulate its physiological and patho-physiological states.BMC Syst. Biol. 2011; 5: 110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that contains 216 metabolites (43% of which are measurable by quantitative metabolomic profiling) to calculate Q10 coefficients for reaction fluxes and to observe pathway usage. By examining metabolite profiles in the context of a cell-scale metabolic model, we were able to assess temperature dependence on a network level, thus bridging the gap between studies at the reaction and physiological levels. RBCs were collected using standard collection procedures and stored in SAGM medium (16Högman C.F. Hedlund K. Sahleström Y. Red cell preservation in protein-poor media. III. Protection against in vitro hemolysis.Vox Sang. 1981; 41: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) at 4, 13, 22, and 37 °C. Starting 1 day after RBC collection (taken as time 0 in figures), metabolomic measurements were made in biological triplicate over time at each temperature (Fig. 1A). The data set was composed of 97 metabolites. In addition, standard blood bank quality control and assurance measurements (e.g. hemolysis and pH) were made at multiple time points over 21 (4, 13, and 22 °C) and 7 days (37 °C); all measured profiles are presented in supplemental Figs. S6–S16 and Data S1. As part of the baseline characterization, we observed the same metabolic changes that have previously been reported in the literature for RBC storage at 4 °C. We observed the same previously documented accumulation of lactate, 5-oxoproline, and hypoxanthine (17D'Alessandro A. Nemkov T. Kelher M. West F.B. Schwindt R.K. Banerjee A. Moore E.E. Silliman C.C.

A complete discussion of the raw metabolomics data is presented in the supplemental information and Figs. S2 and S3. To determine temperature dependence, we first needed to determine how relative storage time scaled across temperature (Food and Drug Administration regulations set the maximum storage time for RBCs at 42 days). To determine a network-level Q10, we used multivariate statistical analysis on the metabolomics data to assess the impact of temperature changes on systemic metabolism. The network-level Q10 was used to determine the time points that represented the same metabolic phase at each temperature. Once these time periods were defined, we calculated Q10 coefficients for each measured metabolite using linear regression. The metabolomics data were then integrated into a mechanistic cell-scale model to calculate the rate of each reaction (i.e. the flux) in the network at each temperature; these calculated reaction rates were used to determine Q10 coefficients for reactions and to assess pathway usage across temperature.

PCA is a multivariate statistical method that reduces the dimensionality of a complex data set by calculating the relative contribution of each measurement to the overall variability observed in the data. For each temperature, we performed PCA (Fig. 1B) on the time-series concentration profiles of eight recently identified extracellular metabolites (adenine, glucose, hypoxanthine, lactate, malate, nicotinamide, 5-oxoproline, and xanthine) that robustly represent the RBC metabolome under storage conditions (20Paglia G.

Biomarkers defining the metabolic age of red blood cells during cold storage.Blood. 2016; 128: e43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These metabolites serve as qualitative biomarkers for the age of stored RBCs and have been shown to also be good quantitative predictors for other systemic metabolite concentrations (21Yurkovich J.T.

To make an accurate comparison across temperatures, the same loading coefficients were applied to the data at each temperature (see “Experimental procedures” for full details). PCA revealed the same metabolic “shifts” that have been previously observed at 4 °C (17D'Alessandro A. Nemkov T. Kelher M. West F.B. Schwindt R.K. Banerjee A. Moore E.E. Silliman C.C. Hansen K.C.

Identified metabolic signature for assessing red blood cell unit quality is associated with endothelial damage markers and clinical outcomes.Transfusion. 2016; 56: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These shifts separate three distinct metabolic states that can be reliably determined from the profiles of the biomarkers (20Paglia G. D'Alessandro A. Rolfsson Ó. Sigurjónsson Ó.E. Bordbar A.

During storage at 4 °C, the two shifts in the PCA plot occur approximately at days 10 and 17. Here, these same metabolic states were observed to be conserved but notably accelerated with temperature as evidenced by the location of the day 7 time point at each temperature (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). We identified the duration of the first metabolic state at each temperature. We then used these time points to determine the starting and ending points for the linear regression that would be used to calculate individual metabolite and reaction Q10 coefficients. The first principal component at each temperature was highly correlated with time (Fig. 1C), yielding a “network-level” Q10 of 1.46 (R2 = 0.97) that describes how the system proceeds in storage time. The third metabolic state at 4 °C is primarily characterized by a general loss of function as the RBC undergoes severe morphological changes (23D'Alessandro A. Kriebardis A.G. Rinalducci S.

Investig. 2017; 127: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, we only used measurements from the first two metabolic states to calculate the network-level Q10. These results show an overall three-state metabolic decay that is observed to accelerate with increased temperature. To determine the temperature dependence of individual metabolites, we used the data from the first metabolic state at each temperature (identified from the PCA results in Fig. 1B). We made this choice because the data are believed to be the most accurate as the cells are still intact and metabolism is functioning the closest to its normal physiological state. We linearly regressed the concentration profile of each metabolite at each temperature and used these rates to calculate a Q10 value (Fig. 1, C and D). Not all metabolite profiles could be accurately fit with a linear curve during the first state; to account for this, we did not include metabolites with an R2 < 0.50. Q10 coefficients for the 48 metabolites whose profiles could be estimated well with a linear fit are reported in Table 1.

The standard deviation of the metabolite Q10 coefficients was 1.03, indicating that although the distribution was centered in the expected range for biological measurements the temperature scaling was not uniform across the network. Interestingly, the biomarker pools that have been shown to robustly define the metabolic decay process (20Paglia G. D'Alessandro A. Rolfsson Ó. Sigurjónsson Ó.E. Bordbar A. Palsson S. Nemkov T.

Several metabolite Q10 coefficients fell below 2.00 or above 3.00, including extracellular 5-oxoporline (1.28), ATP (3.95), ADP (4.48), and extracellular malate (5.05). Next, we investigated the temperature dependence of biochemical reactions in the metabolic network. Previous studies have investigated the temperature dependence of individual reactions (1van't Hoff J.H. Cohen E. Ewan T. Studies in Chemical Dynamics.

Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 313-322Google Scholar), but our goal was to use systems biology approaches to determine the temperature dependence of all reactions in the network together. To this end, we used a mechanistic cell-scale model of the RBC (15Bordbar A. Jamshidi N.

Biol. 2011; 5: 110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to calculate the flux state of the network (i.e. the flux through each reaction in the system). The flux through a reaction (a rate with units of mmol/h) was calculated at each temperature; these values were then used to calculate a Q10 for each reaction using the same procedure shown in Fig. 1D. We tailored the model to the physiology at each temperature by integrating the metabolomics measurements for the first metabolic state into the model according to Bordbar et al. (27Bordbar A. Yurkovich J.T. Paglia G. Rolfsson O. Sigurjónsson Ó.E. Palsson B.O. Elucidating dynamic metabolic physiology through network integration of quantitative time-course metabolomics.Sci.

Model simulations yielded flux states for each temperature. We excluded transporters and reactions that carried flux at fewer than three temperatures to ensure the accuracy of the Q10 calculations. The calculated Q10 coefficients for 35 reactions are shown in Table 2 (only fits with R2 ≥ 0.50 were included in analysis). The distribution of reaction Q10 coefficients (Fig. 2) was tighter than that of the metabolite Q10 coefficients (standard deviation of 0.75 for reactions versus 1.03 for metabolites) but was still centered in the expected 2–3 range (median of 2.73).

https://openalex.org/W2763061616,"The emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections has become a global issue of dire concerns. MERS-CoV infections have been identified in many countries all over the world whereas high level occurrences have been documented in the Middle East and Korea. MERS-CoV is mainly spreading across the geographical region of the Middle East, especially in the Arabian Peninsula, while some imported sporadic cases were reported from the Europe, North America, Africa, and lately Asia. The prevalence of MERS-CoV infections across the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) countries still remains unclear. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to report the prevalence of MERS-CoV in the GCC countries and to also elucidate on its demographics in the Arabian Peninsula. To date, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1,797 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection since June 2012, involving 687 deaths in 27 different countries worldwide. Within a time span of 4 years from June 2012 to July 2016, we collect samples form MERS-CoV infected individuals from National Guard Hospital, Riyadh, and Ministry of health Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries. Our data comprise a total of 1550 cases (67.1% male and 32.9% female). The age-specific prevalence and distribution of MERS-CoV was as follow: <20 yrs (36 cases: 3.28%), 20–39 yrs (331 cases: 30.15%), 40–59 yrs (314 cases: 28.60%), and the highest-risk elderly group aged ≥60 yrs (417 cases: 37.98%). The case distribution among GCC countries was as follows: Saudi Arabia (1441 cases: 93%), Kuwait (4 cases: 0.3%), Bahrain (1 case: 0.1%), Oman (8 cases: 0.5%), Qatar (16 cases: 1.0%), and United Arab Emirates (80 cases: 5.2%). Thus, MERS-CoV was found to be more prevalent in Saudi Arabia especially in Riyadh, where 756 cases (52.4%) were the worst hit area of the country identified, followed by the western region Makkah where 298 cases (20.6%) were recorded. This prevalence update indicates that the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Saudi Arabia, is the hardest hit region regarding the emerging MERS-CoV infections worldwide. GCC countries including Saudi Arabia now have the infrastructure in place that allows physicians and scientific community to identify and immediately respond to the potential risks posed by new outbreaks of MERS-CoV infections in the region. Given the continuum of emergence and the large magnitude of the disease in our region, more studies will be required to bolster capabilities for timely detection and effective control and prevention of MERS-CoV in our region."
https://openalex.org/W2761333439,"The role of astrocytes in Parkinson’s disease is still not well understood. This work studied the astrocytic response to the dopaminergic denervation. Rats were injected in the lateral ventricles with 6-hydroxydopamine (25μg), inducing a dopaminergic denervation of the striatum not accompanied by non-selective tissue damage. The dopaminergic debris were found within spheroids (free-spheroids) which retained some proteins of dopaminergic neurons (e.g., tyrosine hydroxylase, the dopamine transporter protein, and APP) but not others (e.g., α-synuclein). Free-spheroids showed the initial (LC3-autophagosomes) but not the late (Lamp1/Lamp2-lysosomes) components of autophagy (incomplete autophagy), preparing their autophagosomes for an external phagocytosis (accumulation of phosphatidylserine). Free-spheroids were penetrated by astrocyte processes (fenestrated-spheroids) which made them immunoreactive for GFAP and S100β, and which had some elements needed to continue the debris degradation (Lamp1/Lamp2). Finally, proteins normally found in neurons (TH, DAT and α-synuclein) were observed within astrocytes 2–5 days after the dopaminergic degeneration, suggesting that the intracellular contents of degenerated cells had been transferred to astrocytes. Taken together, present data suggest phagocytosis as a physiological role of striatal astrocytes, a role which could be critical for cleaning striatal debris during the initial stages of Parkinson’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2761486456,"Background Increased protease activity is a key pathological feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the differences in extracellular matrix remodelling (ECM) in Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are not well described. An increased understanding of the inflammatory processes may provide optimized disease monitoring and diagnostics. We investigated the tissue remodelling in IBD and IBS patients by using novel blood-based biomarkers reflecting ECM remodelling. Methods Five ECM biomarkers (VICM, BGM, EL-NE, C5M, Pro-C5) were measured by competitive ELISAs in serum from 72 CD patients, 60 UC patients, 22 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 24 healthy donors. One-way analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U-test, logistic regression models, and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was carried out to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the biomarkers. Results The ECM remodelling was significantly different in UC compared to CD. The best biomarker combination to differentiate UC from CD and colonic CD was BGM and VICM (AUC = 0.98, P<0.001; AUC = 0.97, P<0.001), and the best biomarker combination to differentiate IBD from IBS patients were BGM, EL-NE, and Pro-C5 (AUC = 0.8, P<0.001). When correcting for the use of immunosuppressant and elevated CRP levels (CRP>5mg/mL), correlation of Pro-C5 (r = 0.36) with CDAI was slightly improved compared to CRP (r = 0.27) corrected for the use of immunosuppressant. Furthermore, BGM and EL-NE biomarkers were highly associated with colon inflammation in CD patients. Conclusion ECM fragments of tissue remodelling in IBD affect UC and CD differently, and may aid in differentiating IBD from IBS (EL-NE, BGM, Pro-C5), and UC from CD patients (BGM, VICM). Formation of type V collagen is related to the level of inflammation in CD and may reflect disease activity in CD."
https://openalex.org/W2762773567,"Background Treatment response to systemic corticosteroid in asthmatic children is heterogeneous and may be mediated by epigenetic mechanism(s). We aim to identify DNA methylation (DNAm) changes responsive to steroid, and DNAm biomarkers that distinguish treatment response. Materials and methods We followed 33 children (ages 5–18) presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) for asthma exacerbation. Based on whether they met discharge criteria in ≤24 hours, participants were grouped into good and poor responders to steroid treatment. Nasal samples were collected upon presentation to the ED (T0) and 18–24 hours later (T1). Genome-wide DNAm was measured for both time points in 20 subjects, and compared between T0 and T1 in good and poor responders respectively. DNAm at T1 was also compared between two responder groups. DNAm of selected CpGs was verified in the complete cohort, and expression of associated genes was examined. Interactions between DNAm, common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at the CpG sites and treatment responses were assessed. Results Three CpGs located in the OTX2 promoter showed responder-specific DNAm changes from T0 to T1, in which DNAm decreased in good but not in poor responders. Good and poor responders showed differential DNAm at T1 in 127 CpGs without and 182 CpGs with common SNP co-localization. Negative correlations between DNAm and gene expression were observed at CpGs located within the LDHC promoter, suggesting an impact of DNAm on gene regulation. Interactions between SNPs, DNAm and treatment response were detected. Conclusion Acute systemic steroid treatment modifies nasal DNAm in good responders. Nasal DNAm, dependent or independent of SNPs, can differentiate response to treatment in acute asthmatic children."
https://openalex.org/W2762908328,"The transient receptor potential cation channel mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) channel is a conduit for lysosomal calcium efflux, and channel activity may be affected by lysosomal contents. The lysosomes of retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells are particularly susceptible to build-up of lysosomal waste products because they must degrade the outer segments phagocytosed daily from adjacent photoreceptors; incomplete degradation leads to accumulation of lipid waste in lysosomes. This study asks whether stimulation of TRPML1 can release lysosomal calcium in RPE cells and whether such release is affected by lysosomal accumulations. The TRPML agonist ML-SA1 raised cytoplasmic calcium levels in mouse RPE cells, hesRPE cells, and ARPE-19 cells; this increase was rapid, robust, reversible, and reproducible. The increase was not altered by extracellular calcium removal or by thapsigargin but was eliminated by lysosomal rupture with glycyl-l-phenylalanine-β-naphthylamide. Treatment with desipramine to inhibit acid sphingomyelinase or YM201636 to inhibit PIKfyve also reduced the cytoplasmic calcium increase triggered by ML-SA1, whereas RPE cells from TRPML1-/- mice showed no response to ML-SA1. Cotreatment with chloroquine and U18666A induced formation of neutral, autofluorescent lipid in RPE lysosomes and decreased lysosomal Ca2+ release. Lysosomal Ca2+ release was also impaired in RPE cells from the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 4-/- mouse model of Stargardt's retinal dystrophy. Neither TRPML1 mRNA nor total lysosomal calcium levels were altered in these models, suggesting a more direct effect on the channel. In summary, stimulation of TRPML1 elevates cytoplasmic calcium levels in RPE cells, but this response is reduced by lysosomal accumulation.-Gómez, N. M., Lu, W. Lim, J. C., Kiselyov, K., Campagno, K. E., Grishchuk, Y., Slaugenhaupt, S. A., Pfeffer, B., Fliesler, S. J., Mitchell, C. H. Robust lysosomal calcium signaling through channel TRPML1 is impaired by lysosomal lipid accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2760846602,"Carrageenans are sulfated α-1,3-β-1,4-galactans found in the cell wall of some red algae that are practically valuable for their gelation and biomimetic properties but also serve as a potential carbon source for marine bacteria. Carbohydrate degradation has been studied extensively for terrestrial plant/bacterial systems, but sulfation is not present in these cases, meaning the marine enzymes used to degrade carrageenans must possess unique features to recognize these modifications. To gain insights into these features, we have focused on κ-carrageenases from two distant bacterial phyla, which belong to glycoside hydrolase family 16 and cleave the β-1,4 linkage of κ-carrageenan. We have solved the crystal structure of the catalytic module of ZgCgkA from Zobellia galactanivorans at 1.66 A resolution and compared it with the only other structure available, that of PcCgkA from Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora 9T (ATCC 43555T). We also describe the first substrate complex in the inactivated mutant form of PcCgkA at 1.7 A resolution. The structural and biochemical comparison of these enzymes suggests key determinants that underlie the functional properties of this subfamily. In particular, we identified several arginine residues that interact with the polyanionic substrate, and confirmed the functional relevance of these amino acids using a targeted mutagenesis strategy. These results give new insight into the diversity of the κ-carrageenase subfamily. The phylogenetic analyses show the presence of several distinct clades of enzymes that relate to differences in modes of action or subtle differences within the same substrate specificity, matching the hybrid character of the κ-carrageenan polymer."
https://openalex.org/W2763412323,"Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) plays a key role in reverse cholesterol transport by transferring an acyl group from phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol, promoting the maturation of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) from discoidal to spherical particles. LCAT is activated through an unknown mechanism by apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and other mimetic peptides that form a belt around HDL. Here, we report the crystal structure of LCAT with an extended lid that blocks access to the active site, consistent with an inactive conformation. Residues Thr-123 and Phe-382 in the catalytic domain form a latch-like interaction with hydrophobic residues in the lid. Because these residues are mutated in genetic disease, lid displacement was hypothesized to be an important feature of apoA-I activation. Functional studies of site-directed mutants revealed that loss of latch interactions or the entire lid enhanced activity against soluble ester substrates, and hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry revealed that the LCAT lid is extremely dynamic in solution. Upon addition of a covalent inhibitor that mimics one of the reaction intermediates, there is an overall decrease in HDX in the lid and adjacent regions of the protein, consistent with ordering. These data suggest a model wherein the active site of LCAT is shielded from soluble substrates by a dynamic lid until it interacts with HDL to allow transesterification to proceed.

LCAT transfers the sn-2 acyl group of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to cholesterol to create a more hydrophobic cholesteryl ester that accumulates within the core of HDL particles (referred to as α-LCAT activity), thus driving maturation of discoidal pre-β-HDL to spherical α-HDL and promoting further cholesterol efflux from arterial plaques (2Glomset J.A.

The presence of bound Fab and a crystal contact formed in the active site also complicates interpretation of how lid conformation correlates with activity in these structures. Here, we report the 3.1-Å crystal structure of LCAT, in the absence of antibodies, wherein the lid is ordered and packs over the active site, forming hydrophobic latch-like interactions with FED-associated residues Thr-123 and Phe-382 (16Vanloo B.

We hypothesized that apoA-I is able to activate LCAT via displacement of this lid, perhaps by interacting with or perturbing residues that form the interface between the lid and the α/β hydrolase domain. We confirmed through site-directed mutagenesis that perturbation of the lid and the latch residues indeed leads to enhanced hydrolysis of soluble esters. These variants exhibited a loss of HDL-dependent activity, confirming the importance of these sites in acyl transfer. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) showed that the lid region was highly dynamic, but it has less HDX in the presence of isopropyl dodecylfluorophosphonate (IDFP), a covalent inhibitor that mimics an acyl intermediate. The results of these experiments support a role for the lid in protecting the active site from inappropriate substrates as well as in driving interactions with HDL and lipid substrates. Crystals of full-length, fully glycosylated LCAT were obtained, which diffracted to 3.1 Å spacings (Table 1). Initial phases were estimated via molecular replacement with an LCAT homology model derived from LPLA2 (17Glukhova A. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Kelly R. Abe A. Shayman J.A. Tesmer J.J.

The overall domain architecture is conserved with LPLA2 and previously reported LCAT structures, with an α/β hydrolase domain positioning the active site at the center of the enzyme, in a cavity flanked by the cap and membrane-binding domains (Fig. 1A) (17Glukhova A.

Surprisingly, residues 226–246 in the cap domain of LCAT (referred to as the “lid”), which includes the dynamic “lid loop” of LPLA2 (residues 226–236 in LCAT), adopt a different conformation from all prior structures of LCAT and LPLA2 and is almost fully ordered (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Here, the lid extends over the active site such that it would hinder substrate and solvent access. The initial segment of the lid (residues 226–234) is better ordered than the remainder (Fig. 1B), and residues Pro-232 and Met-234 form extensive interactions with residues Thr-123 and Phe-382 of the α/β hydrolase domain. The latter portion of the lid (residues 235–246, with the density at 240–241 too weak to model with confidence) corresponds to a sequence that instead forms a prominent α-helix (a4) that packs between the membrane-binding and cap domains in all reported LPLA2 structures (supplemental Fig. S1B). It is not clear whether an analogous conformation for the lid can occur in LPLA2 because its αA–αA′ loop, which is two residues longer than in LCAT, would sterically clash with the path of lid in LCAT (supplemental Fig. S1B). The lid adopts a similar conformation in all four unique subunits of LCAT, suggesting that it is not simply a consequence of crystal lattice contacts, although residues 235–239 in the lid form a similar crystal contact in each protomer via a crystallographic 2-fold interaction. Despite its closed configuration and contacts, the lid still exhibits a high level of flexibility as judged by its relatively high B-factors compared with the rest of the structure (Fig. 1D).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsClosed lid LCATData collection Space groupP21 Cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)95.9, 123.5, 114.8 α, β, γ (°)90.0, 96.2, 90.0 Resolution (Å)48.3–3.1 (3.2–3.1)aValues in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell.

Chem. 2016; 291: 2799-2811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the first, LCAT was crystallized in complex with a Fab fragment that recognizes the membrane-binding domain. This crystal form (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries 4XX1 and 4XWG, referred to henceforth as closed-Fab) exhibits a conformation similar to our new closed, ligand-free structure, although lid residues 231–237 were not modeled (supplemental Fig. S1A). In the second (PDB entry 5BV7, referred to henceforth as open-2Fab), LCAT is additionally in complex with a second agonistic Fab fragment that binds primarily to the α/β hydrolase domain. In this structure the lid adopts a retracted conformation more similar to prior structures of LPLA2 (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1C). This “open” lid conformation could be a consequence of either the agonist antibody or an N-terminal pentapeptide (with mutations L4F/N5D) that docks within the active site from a neighboring crystal lattice contact, which would prevent the lid from assuming any of the other previously observed lid conformations. In light of these new structures, we re-evaluated our original 8.7 Å LCAT structure (PDB entry 4X96) of an N- and C-terminally truncated variant (ΔNΔC, residues 21–397). Because LCAT in this low-resolution structure crystallized as a trimer with Trp-48 from the membrane-binding domain docking in the active site of each symmetry-related subunit, it is also not compatible with a closed lid configuration like those observed in our structures or the closed-Fab crystal structures (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, this low-resolution trimeric LCAT structure requires an open lid, although this could not be directly observed given the low resolution. Thus, the lid region of LCAT seems to be very dynamic, with the ability to assume configurations that either hinder (current and closed-Fab structures) or allow full access (low-resolution and open-2Fab structures) to the active site (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). The transformation between these two conformations is modeled in supplemental Movie S1, which morphs between the closed lid conformation we report here and the open-2Fab structure. The conformational flexibility of the LCAT lid and its proximity to the active site suggests that it could be important for regulation of activity by apoA-I. For example, the binding of apoA-I either to Thr-123 and Phe-382 could serve to release the lid and allow easier access of substrates to the catalytic site. To test this hypothesis, we created a panel of LCAT variants with site-directed mutations either in the lid or at other interacting or nearby surface-exposed sites previously postulated to be involved in apoA-I binding (e.g. Thr-123 (28Funke H. von Eckardstein A.

Residues were mutated to alanine and/or to known disease-associated mutations as applicable. Residues 227–246 of the lid were also deleted and replaced with a three-residue SGS linker (Δlid), and a chimeric enzyme was created with the lid substituted with the analogous region of LPLA2 (residues 229–246; LPLA2lid). A second chimeric enzyme contained the analogous two-residue longer αA–αA′ loop from LPLA2 (residues 111–119, LPLA2αA), which we hypothesized would prevent lid closure in that enzyme. Finally, we generated control variants with mutations in regions well-established to be important for HDL and/or membrane binding, such as exposed hydrophobic positions in the membrane-binding domain (Trp-48 and Leu-70), and the ΔNΔC LCAT variant, which consists of a core domain similar to full-length LPLA2 but lacks the N and C termini (17Glukhova A.

Although a variety of robots have been proposed as possible therapeutic tools, the physical appearances of humanoid robots currently used in therapy with these patients are highly varied. Very little is known about how these varied designs are experienced by individuals with ASD. In this study, we systematically evaluated preferences regarding robot appearance in a group of 16 individuals with ASD (ages 10–17). Our data suggest that there may be important differences in preference for different types of robots that vary according to interaction type for individuals with ASD. Specifically, within our pilot sample, children with higher-levels of reported ASD symptomatology reported a preference for specific humanoid robots to those perceived as more mechanical or mascot-like. The findings of this pilot study suggest that preferences and reactions to robotic interactions may vary tremendously across individuals with ASD. Future work should evaluate how such differences may be systematically measured and potentially harnessed to facilitate meaningful interactive and intervention paradigms."

The aim of the present study was to explore the underlying mechanisms of skeletal muscle damage/wasting post-burn. Rats were randomized to the sham, sham+4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA, a pharmacological chaperone promoting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding/trafficking, commonly considered as an inhibitor of ER), burn (30% total body surface area), and burn+4-PBA groups; and sacrificed at 1, 4, 7, 14 days after the burn injury. Tibial anterior muscle was harvested for transmission electron microscopy, calcium imaging, gene expression and protein analysis of ER stress / ubiquitin-proteasome system / autophagy, and calpain activity measurement. The results showed that ER stress markers were increased in the burn group compared with the sham group, especially at post-burn days 4 and 7, which might consequently elevate cytoplasmic calcium concentration, promote calpain production as well as activation, and cause skeletal muscle damage/wasting of TA muscle after severe burn injury. Interestingly, treatment with 4-PBA prevented burn-induced ER swelling and altered protein expression of ER stress markers and calcium release, attenuating calpain activation and skeletal muscle damage/wasting after severe burn injury. Atrogin-1 and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio were also increased in the burn group compared with the sham group, while MuRF-1 remained unchanged; 4-PBA decreased atrogin-1 in the burn group. Taken together, these findings suggested that severe burn injury induces ER stress, which in turns causes calpain activation. ER stress and subsequent activated calpain play a critical role in skeletal muscle damage/wasting in burned rats."
https://openalex.org/W2763134627,"Background Recent evidence demonstrates increased short-term risk of cardiac complications and respiratory failure among patients with heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, concurrent with an episode of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We evaluated patients with pre-existing HF or COPD, beginning 30 days after CAP diagnosis, to determine if CAP had a prolonged impact on their underlying comorbidity. Methods A retrospective matched-cohort design using US healthcare claims was employed. In each month of accrual, patients with HF or COPD who developed CAP (“CAP patients”) were matched (1:1, without replacement, on demographic and clinical profiles) to patients with HF or COPD who did not develop CAP (“comparison patients”). All patients were aged ≥40 years, and were pneumonia free during prior 1-year period. Exacerbation beginning 30 days after the CAP diagnosis and for the subsequent 1-year period were compared between CAP and comparison patients. Findings 38,010 (4·6%) HF patients and 48,703 (5·9%) COPD patients experienced a new CAP episode requiring hospitalization or outpatient care only, and were matched to comparison patients. In the HF subset, CAP patients were 47·2% more likely to experience an exacerbation vs patients without CAP (17·8% vs. 12·1%; p<0·001); in the COPD subset, CAP patients were 42·3% more likely to experience an exacerbation (16·2% vs. 11·4%; p<0·001). Conclusions Our data provide evidence that CAP foreshadows a prolonged increase in risk of exacerbation of underlying HF or COPD in adults, and suggests a potential benefit to CAP prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2761828743,"The use of antioxidant therapy in the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or obesity remains controversial. Our aim is to demonstrate that antioxidant supplementation may promote negative effects if used before the establishment of oxidative stress due to a reduced ROS generation under physiological levels, in a mice model of obesity.C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet for 14 weeks, with (OE group) or without (O group) vitamin E supplementation.O mice developed a mild degree of obesity, which was not enough to induce metabolic alterations or oxidative stress. These animals exhibited a healthy expansion of retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (rpWAT) and the liver showed no signs of lipotoxicity. Interestingly, despite achieving a similar body weight, OE mice were insulin resistant. In the rpWAT they presented a reduced generation of ROS, even below physiological levels (C: 1651.0 ± 212.0; O: 3113 ± 284.7; OE: 917.6 ±104.4 RFU/mg protein. C vs OE p< 0.01). ROS decay may impair their action as second messengers, which could account for the reduced adipocyte differentiation, lipid transport and adipogenesis compared to the O group. Together, these processes limited the expansion of this fat pad and as a consequence, lipid flux shifted towards the liver, causing steatosis and hepatomegaly, which may contribute to the marked insulin resistance.This study provides in vivo evidence for the role of ROS as second messengers in adipogenesis, lipid metabolism and insulin signaling. Reducing ROS generation below physiological levels when the oxidative process has not yet been established may be the cause of the controversial results obtained by antioxidant therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2763005888,"Brucella melitensis is the causative agent of brucellosis in small ruminants and is of considerable economic and public health importance in many countries worldwide. The control of disease in humans depends on the control of disease in livestock; however, few counties with endemic B. melitensis infection have been able to successfully eradicate this pathogen. This underscores the need for further research on the pathogenesis of both virulent and vaccine strains of B. melitensis in the small ruminant host. The aim of the present study was to characterize clinical effects, tissue colonization, shedding, and humoral immune response following B. melitensis infection in goats. Both virulent (16M) and reduced virulence (Rev. 1) strains of B. melitensis were studied. Pregnant goats were infected at 11-14 weeks of gestation with 8 x 106 or 8 x 107 CFU of B. melitensis. Infection of goats with B. melitensis 16M resulted in an 86% abortion rate. This strain disseminated widely in pregnant does post-infection with none of the 15 sampled tissues spared from colonization. Importantly, we report the first isolation of B. melitensis from muscle tissue in ruminants. Pathogenesis of Rev. 1 infection was variable with two does showing minimal colonization and one doe exhibiting disease similar to that of animals infected with fully virulent 16M. Shedding of B. melitensis in milk occurred in all 16M- and Rev. 1- infected goats. In pregnant animals challenged with virulent B. melitensis, median time to seroconversion was 21 days; however, 2 animals did not seroconvert until after abortion."
https://openalex.org/W2762130374,"The numerous γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) subtypes are differentially expressed and mediate distinct functions at neuronal level. In this study we have investigated GABAAR-mediated modulation of the spontaneous activity patterns of primary neuronal networks from murine frontal cortex by characterizing the effects induced by a wide selection of pharmacological tools at a plethora of activity parameters in microelectrode array (MEA) recordings. The basic characteristics of the primary cortical neurons used in the recordings were studied in some detail, and the expression levels of various GABAAR subunits were investigated by western blotting and RT-qPCR. In the MEA recordings, the pan-GABAAR agonist muscimol and the GABABR agonist baclofen were observed to mediate phenotypically distinct changes in cortical network activity. Selective augmentation of αβγ GABAAR signaling by diazepam and of δ-containing GABAAR (δ-GABAAR) signaling by DS1 produced pronounced changes in the majority of the activity parameters, both drugs mediating similar patterns of activity changes as muscimol. The apparent importance of δ-GABAAR signaling for network activity was largely corroborated by the effects induced by the functionally selective δ-GABAAR agonists THIP and Thio-THIP, whereas the δ-GABAAR selective potentiator DS2 only mediated modest effects on network activity, even when co-applied with low THIP concentrations. Interestingly, diazepam exhibited dramatically right-shifted concentration-response relationships at many of the activity parameters when co-applied with a trace concentration of DS1 compared to when applied alone. In contrast, the potencies and efficacies displayed by DS1 at the networks were not substantially altered by the concomitant presence of diazepam. In conclusion, the holistic nature of the information extractable from the MEA recordings offers interesting insights into the contributions of various GABAAR subtypes/subgroups to cortical network activity and the putative functional interplay between these receptors in these neurons."

Results were compared to guidelines for the provision of social facilities in South Africa: 5km to a clinic and 30km to a hospital. Results During 2011–2014, 1027 new XDR TB cases were diagnosed throughout all 11 districts of KwaZulu-Natal, of whom 404 (39%) were enrolled and had geospatial data collected. Participants would have had to travel a mean distance of 2.9 km (CI 95%: 1.8–4.1) to the nearest clinic and 17.6 km (CI 95%: 11.4–23.8) to the nearest hospital. Actual distances that participants travelled to the health facility that diagnosed XDR TB ranged from <10 km (n = 143, 36%) to >50 km (n = 109, 27%), with a mean of 69 km. The majority (77%) of participants travelled farther than the recommended distance to a clinic (5 km) and 39% travelled farther than the recommended distance to a hospital (30 km). Nearly half (46%) of participants were diagnosed at a health facility in eThekwini district, of whom, 36% resided outside the Durban metropolitan area. Conclusions XDR TB cases are widely distributed throughout KwaZulu-Natal province with a denser focus in eThekwini district. Patients travelled long distances to the health facility where they were diagnosed with XDR TB, suggesting a potential role for migration or transportation in the XDR TB epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2760969359,"Astrocytoma is the most common type of primary malignant brain tumor, with pretty lowly 5-year survival rate in patients. Although extended surgical removal of the tumor and postoperative chemotherapy/radiotherapy executed, still there is large recurrence rate, mainly because diffuse glioma tumor cells ubiquitously infiltrate into normal parenchyma. So it becomes a priority to hunt novel molecular and signaling pathway targets to suppress astrocyma progression. HSP10, an important member of Heat shock proteins (Hsps) family, classically works as molecular chaperone folding or degradating of target proteins. Evolutionarily, HSP10 is also reported to be involved in immunomodulation and tumor progression. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), important in DNA repair, is one of the main cleavage targets of caspase. And cleaved PARP (c-PARP) can serve as a marker of cells undergoing apoptosis. So far, whether the expression of HSP10 or c-PARP is associated with clinicopathologic implication for astrocytoma has not been reported. Meanwhile, it is unclear about the relationship between HSP10 and cell apoptosis. The purpose of this research is to elucidate the association between the expression of HSP10 and c-PARP and clinicopathological characteristics of astrocytoma by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that positive percentage of high HSP10 expression in astrocytoma 42/103, 40.8%) was significantly higher than that in the non-tumor control brain tissues (8/43, 18.6%) (P = 0.01). While no apparent difference of high c-PARP expression existed between astrocytoma and non-tumor control brain tissues. Furthermore, elevated expression of HSP10 was negative related to low expression of c-PARP (r = -0.224, P = 0.023), indicating high expression of HSP10 in astrocytoma inhibited apoptosis process effectively. And overexpression of HSP10 was proved to be the independent poor prognostic factor for astrocytoma by multivariate analysis. Taken together, our results suggest that elevated expression of HSP10 protein inhibits apoptosis and associates with poor prognosis of astrocytoma."
https://openalex.org/W2762382554,"Some head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have a distinct aetiology, which depends on the presence of oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV). Also, HNSCC contains cancer stem cells (CSCs) that have greater radioresistance and capacity to change replication dynamics in response to irradiation compared to non-clonogenic cells. Since there is limited data on CSCs in HNSCC as a function of HPV status, better understanding of their radiobiology may enable improved treatment outcome.Baseline and post-irradiation changes in CSC proportions were investigated by flow cytometry in a HPV-negative (UM-SCC-1) and a HPV-positive (UM-SCC-47) HNSCC cell line, using fluorescent staining with CD44/ALDH markers. CSC proportions in both irradiated and unirradiated cultures were compared for the two cell lines at various times post-irradiation. To assess repopulation of CSCs, untreated cultures were depleted of CD44+/ALDH+ cells and re-cultured for 3 weeks before flow cytometry analysis.CSC proportions in untreated cell lines were 0.57% (UM-SCC-1) and 2.87% (UM-SCC-47). Untreated cell lines depleted of CD44+/ALDH+ repopulated this phenotype to a mean of 0.15% (UM-SCC-1) and 6.76% (UM-SCC-47). All UM-SCC-47 generations showed elevated CSC proportions after irradiation, with the most significant increase at 2 days post-irradiation. The highest elevation in UM-SCC-1 CSCs was observed at 1 day post-irradiation in the 2nd generation and at 3 days after irradiation in the 3rd generation. When measured after 10 days, only the 3rd generation of UM-SCC-1 showed elevated CSCs.CSC proportions in both cell lines were elevated after exposure and varied with time post irradiation. UM-SCC-47 displayed significant plasticity in repopulating the CSC phenotype in depleted cultures, which was not seen in UM-SCC-1."
https://openalex.org/W2762922324,"Introduction During pregnancy, immunoglobulin G (IgG) is transferred from the mother to the fetus, providing protection from disease in early infancy. Plasmodium falciparum infections may reduce maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency, but mechanisms remain unclear. Methods Mother-cord paired serum samples collected at delivery from Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Thailand-Myanmar Border Area (TMBA) were tested for IgG1 and IgG3 to four P. falciparum antigens and measles antigen, as well as total serum IgG. Multivariable linear regression was conducted to assess the association of peripheral P. falciparum infection during pregnancy or placental P. falciparum infection assessed at delivery with maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency. Path analysis assessed the extent to which associations between P. falciparum infection and antibody transfer were mediated by gestational age at delivery or levels of maternal total serum IgG. Results Maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency of IgG1 and IgG3 was lower in PNG compared to TMBA (mean difference in cord antibody levels (controlling for maternal antibody levels) ranged from -0.88 to 0.09, median of -0.20 log2 units). Placental P. falciparum infections were associated with substantially lower maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency in PNG primigravid women (mean difference in cord antibody levels (controlling for maternal antibody levels) ranged from -0.62 to -0.10, median of -0.36 log2 units), but not multigravid women. The lower antibody transfer efficiency amongst primigravid women with placental infection was only partially mediated by gestational age at delivery (proportion indirect effect ranged from 0% to 18%), whereas no mediation effects of maternal total serum IgG were observed. Discussion Primigravid women may be at risk of impaired maternofetal antibody transport with placental P. falciparum infection. Direct effects of P. falciparum on the placenta, rather than earlier gestational age and elevated serum IgG, are likely responsible for the majority of the reduction in maternofetal antibody transfer efficiency with placental infection."
https://openalex.org/W2763017756,"Helicobacter cinaedi is associated with nosocomial infections. The CRISPR-Cas system provides adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements. We investigated the CRISPR-Cas system in H. cinaedi to assess the potential of the CRISPR-based microevolution of H. cinaedi strains. A genotyping method based on CRISPR spacer organization was carried out using 42 H. cinaedi strains. The results of sequence analysis showed that the H. cinaedi strains used in this study had two CRISPR loci (CRISPR1 and CRISPR2). The lengths of the consensus direct repeat sequences in CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 were both 36 bp-long, and 224 spacers were found in the 42 H. cinaedi strains. Analysis of the organization and sequence similarity of the spacers of the H. cinaedi strains showed that CRISPR arrays could be divided into 7 different genotypes. Each genotype had a different ancestral spacer, and spacer acquisition/deletion events occurred while isolates were spreading. Spacer polymorphisms of conserved arrays across the strains were instrumental for differentiating closely-related strains collected from the same hospital. MLST had little variability, while the CRISPR sequences showed remarkable diversity. Our data revealed the structural features of H. cinaedi CRISPR loci for the first time. CRISPR sequences constitute a valuable basis for genotyping, provide insights into the divergence and relatedness between closely-related strains, and reflect the microevolutionary process of H. cinaedi."
https://openalex.org/W2763424645,"Objective It was shown that sodium can promote auto-immunity through the activation of the Th17 pathway. We aimed to compare sodium intake in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) vs. matched controls. Methods This case-control study included 24 patients with RA at diagnosis and 24 controls matched by age, gender and body mass index. Sodium intake was evaluated by 24-hr urinary sodium excretion. Results Sodium excretion was greater for patients with early RA (2,849±1,350 vs. 2,182±751.7mg/day, p = 0.039) than controls. This difference remained significant after adjustment for smoking and the use of anti-hypertensive and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (p = 0.043). Patients with radiographic erosion at the time of diagnosis had a higher sodium excretion than those without (p = 0.028). Conclusion Patients with early RA showed increased sodium excretion which may have contributed to autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2761604919,"Air filtration has been shown to be efficient in reducing pathogen burden in circulating air. We determined at laboratory scale the retention efficiency of different air filter types either composed of a prefilter (EU class G4) and a secondary fiberglass filter (EU class F9) or consisting of a filter mat (EU class M6 and F8-9). Four filter prototypes were tested for their capability to remove aerosol containing equine arteritis virus (EAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), bovine enterovirus 1 (BEV), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), and Staphylococcus (S.) aureus from air. Depending on the filter prototype and utilisation, the airflow was set at 1,800 m3/h (combination of upstream prefilter and fiberglass filter) or 80 m3/h (filter mat). The pathogens were aerosolized and their concentration was determined in front of and behind the filter by culture or quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, survival of the pathogens over time in the filter material was determined. Bacteria were most efficiently filtered with a reduction rate of up to 99.9% depending on the filter used. An approximately 98% reduction was achieved for the viruses tested. Viability or infectivity of APP or PRRSV in the filter material decreased below the detection limit after 4 h and 24 h, respectively, whereas S. aureus was still culturable after 4 weeks. Our results demonstrate that pathogens can efficiently be reduced by air filtration. Consequently, air filtration combined with other strict biosecurity measures markedly reduces the risk of introducing airborne transmitted pathogens to animal facilities. In addition, air filtration might be useful in reducing bioaerosols within a pig barn, hence improving respiratory health of pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2761439951,"The innate immune response of Anopheles gambiae involves the transcriptional upregulation of effector genes. Therefore, the cis-regulatory sequences and their cognate binding factors play essential roles in the mosquito's immune response. However, the genetic control of the mosquito's innate immune response is not yet fully understood. To gain further insight on the elements, the factors and the potential mechanisms involved, an open chromatin profiling was carried out on A. gambiae-derived immune-responsive cells. Here, we report the identification of cis-regulatory sites, immunity-related transcription factor binding sites, and cis-regulatory modules. A de novo motif discovery carried out on this set of cis-regulatory sequences identified immunity-related motifs and cis-regulatory modules. These modules contain motifs that are similar to binding sites for REL-, STAT-, lola- and Deaf1-type transcription factors. Sequence motifs similar to the binding sites for GAGA were found within a cis-regulatory module, together with immunity-related transcription factor binding sites. The presence of Deaf1- and lola-type binding sites, along with REL- and STAT-type binding sites, suggests that the immunity function of these two factors could have been conserved both in Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae."
https://openalex.org/W2761742574,"Background and objective Cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes pose a global health burden. Therefore, clarifying the pathology of these risk factors is essential. Previous studies have found positive and negative associations between one or more cardiovascular risk factors and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) probably due to diverse methodological approaches when analysing peripheral BDNF levels. Moreover, only a few studies have been performed in youth populations. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to examine the association between serum BDNF and a composite z-score consisting of six cardiovascular risk factors. A secondary aim was to examine the associations between serum BDNF and each of the six risk factors. Methods Four hundred and forty-seven apparently healthy adolescents between 11–17 years of age participated in this cross-sectional study. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), anthropometrics, pubertal status, blood pressure (BP), serum BDNF, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), blood glucose and insulin were measured. Information about alcohol consumption and socio-economic status was collected via questionnaires. Associations were modelled using linear regression analysis. Results Serum BDNF was positively associated with the composite z-score in the total study sample (standardized beta coefficient (std.β) = 0.10, P = 0.037). In males, serum BDNF was positively associated with the composite z-score (Std. β = 0.14, P = 0.034) and HOMA-IR (Std. β = 0.19, P = 0.004), and negatively associated with CRF (Std. β = -0.15, P = 0.026). In females, BDNF was positively associated with TG (Std. β = 0.14, P = 0.030) and negatively associated with waist circumference (WC) (Std. β = -0.16, P = 0.012). Conclusion Serum BDNF was positively associated with a composite z-score of cardiovascular risk factors. This association seems to be mainly driven by the association between TG, HOMA-IR and serum BDNF, and particularly for males. Further longitudinal research is warranted to determine the temporal relationship between BDNF and cardiovascular risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2761384079,"Membrane trafficking is highly organized to maintain cellular homeostasis in any organisms. Membrane-embedded transporters are targeted to various organelles to execute appropriate partition and allocation of their substrates, such as ions or sugars. To ensure the fidelity of targeting and sorting, membrane proteins including transporters have sorting signals that specify the subcellular destination and the trafficking pathway by which the destination is to be reached. Here, we have identified a novel sorting signal (called the tri-aromatic motif) which contains three aromatic residues, two tryptophans and one histidine, for the plasma membrane localization of sugar transporters in the STP family in Arabidopsis. We firstly found that a C-terminal deletion disrupted the sugar uptake activity of STP1 in yeast cells. Additional deletion and mutation analyses demonstrated that the three aromatic residues in the C-terminus, conserved among all Arabidopsis STP transporters, were critical for sugar uptake by not only STP1 but also another STP transporter STP13. We observed that, when the tri-aromatic motif was mutated, STP1 was largely localized at the endomembrane compartments in yeast cells, indicating that this improper subcellular localization led to the loss of sugar absorption. Importantly, our further analyses uncovered that mutations of the tri-aromatic motif resulted in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of STP1 and STP13 in plant cells, suggesting that this motif is involved at the step of ER exit of STP transporters to facilitate their plasma membrane localization. Together, we here identified a novel ER export signal, and showed that appropriate sorting via the tri-aromatic motif is important for sugar absorption by STP transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2762395325,"There is a strong link between integrins and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), but the specifics of the role of integrins in IL-1β signaling are unclear. We describe that IL-1β specifically bound to integrins αvβ3 and α5β1. The E128K mutation in the IL1R-binding site enhanced integrin binding. We studied whether direct integrin binding is involved in IL-1β signaling. We compared sequences of IL-1β and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN), which is an IL-1β homologue but has no agonistic activity. Several surface-exposed Lys residues are present in IL-1β, but not in IL1RN. A disulfide linkage is present in IL1RN, but is not in IL-1β because of natural C117F mutation. Substitution of the Lys residues to Glu markedly reduced integrin binding of E128K IL-1β, suggesting that the Lys residues mediate integrin binding. The Lys mutations reduced, but did not completely abrogate, agonistic action of IL-1β. We studied whether the disulfide linkage plays a role in agonistic action of IL-1β. Reintroduction of the disulfide linkage by the F117C mutation did not affect agonistic activity of WT IL-1β, but effectively reduced the remaining agonistic activity of the Lys mutants. Also, deletion of the disulfide linkage in IL1RN by the C116F mutation did not make it agonistic. We propose that the direct binding to IL-1β to integrins is primarily important for agonistic IL-1β signaling, and that the disulfide linkage indirectly affects signaling by blocking conformational changes induced by weak integrin binding to the Lys mutants. The integrin-IL-1β interaction is a potential target for drug discovery."

Darier disease affects up to 1 in 30 000 people and is caused by mutations in the ATP2A2 gene, which encodes to the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase isoform 2 that pumps calcium into the endoplasmic reticulum. Although many ATP2A2 variants have been described, it is not known if genotype correlates with phenotype, which could be important for prognosis and treatment. This is the first study to use whole exome sequencing to screen the ATP2A2 gene in a cohort of 28 clinically diagnosed Darier disease patients. Twenty-one different disease causing variants were identified and 15 of these were novel. Sixteen of the 21 variants were predicted to be pathogenic using in silico prediction programs. There were seven missense, four intronic/splice-sites, three frameshifts, two in-frame deletions, four nonsense and one synonymous mutations. This study also found ten patients who harbour more than one ATP2A2 variant. The phenotype of the patient cohort was assessed by photography and by patient questionnaires. The genotype-phenotype association was examined for all variants in relation to the patient's disease severity score, and no correlation could be established."
https://openalex.org/W2761981890,"Abrogation of ribosome synthesis (ribosomal stress) leads to cell cycle arrest. However, the immediate cell response to cessation of ribosome formation and the transition from normal cell proliferation to cell cycle arrest have not been characterized. Furthermore, there are conflicting conclusions about whether cells are arrested in G2/M or G1, and whether the cause is dismantling ribosomal assembly per se, or the ensuing decreased number of translating ribosomes. To address these questions, we have compared the time kinetics of key cell cycle parameters after inhibiting ribosome formation or function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Within one-to-two hours of repressing genes for individual ribosomal proteins or Translation Elongation factor 3, configurations of spindles, spindle pole bodies began changing. Actin began depolarizing within 4 hours. Thus the loss of ribosome formation and function is sensed immediately. After several hours no spindles or mitotic actin rings were visible, but membrane ingression was completed in most cells and Ace2 was localized to daughter cell nuclei demonstrating that the G1 stage was reached. Thus cell division was completed without the help of a contractile actin ring. Moreover, cell wall material held mother and daughter cells together resulting in delayed cell separation, suggesting that expression or function of daughter gluconases and chitinases is inhibited. Moreover, cell development changes in very similar ways in response to inhibition of ribosome formation and function, compatible with the notion that decreased translation capacity contributes to arresting the cell cycle after abrogation of ribosome biogenesis. Potential implications for the mechanisms of diseases caused by mutations in ribosomal genes (ribosomopathies) are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2763620224,"Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV) is a leading cause of bronchopneumonia in infants and the elderly. To date, knowledge of viral and host protein interactions within HRSV is limited and are critical areas of research. Here, we show that HRSV Matrix (M) protein interacts with the cellular adaptor protein complex 3 specifically via its medium subunit (AP-3Mu3A). This novel protein-protein interaction was first detected via yeast-two hybrid screen and was further confirmed in a mammalian system by immunofluorescence colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation. This novel interaction is further substantiated by the presence of a known tyrosine-based adaptor protein MU subunit sorting signal sequence, YXXФ: where Ф is a bulky hydrophobic residue, which is conserved across the related RSV M proteins. Analysis of point-mutated HRSV M derivatives indicated that AP-3Mu3A- mediated trafficking is contingent on the presence of the tyrosine residue within the YXXL sorting sequence at amino acids 197–200 of the M protein. AP-3Mu3A is up regulated at 24 hours post-infection in infected cells versus mock-infected HEp2 cells. Together, our data suggests that the AP-3 complex plays a critical role in the trafficking of HRSV proteins specifically matrix in epithelial cells. The results of this study add new insights and targets that may lead to the development of potential antivirals and attenuating mutations suitable for candidate vaccines in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2760901590,"There are currently several antibody therapies that directly target tumors, and antibody-drug conjugates represent a novel moiety as next generation therapeutics. Here, we used a unique screening probe, DT3C, to identify functional antibodies that recognized surface molecules and functional epitopes, and which provided toxin delivery capability. Accordingly, we generated the 90G4 antibody, which induced DT3C-dependent cytotoxicity in endothelial cells. Molecular analysis revealed that 90G4 recognized CD321, a protein localized at tight junctions. Although CD321 plays a pivotal role in inflammation and lymphocyte trans-endothelial migration, little is known about its mechanism of action in endothelial cells. Targeting of CD321 by the 90G4 immunotoxin induced cell death. Moreover, 90G4 immunotoxin caused cytotoxicity primarily in migratory endothelial cells, but not in those forming sheets, suggesting a critical role for CD321 in tumor angiogenesis. We also found that hypoxia triggered redistribution of CD321 to a punctate localization on the basal side of cells, resulting in functional impairment of tight junctions and increased motility. Thus, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that endothelial CD321 presented cellular localization in tight junction as well as multifunctional dynamics in several conditions, leading to illuminate the importance of widely-expressed CD321 as a potential target for antitumor therapy."

Furthermore, m-AAA protease–mediated membrane dislocation was impaired in the presence of a large downstream hydrophilic moiety in a membrane substrate. This finding suggested that the m-AAA protease cannot dislocate large hydrophilic domains across the membrane, indicating that the membrane dislocation probably occurs in a lipid environment.

https://openalex.org/W2763912056,"Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease of worldwide distribution, currently present in 98 countries. Since late 2010, an unusual increase of human visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis cases has been observed in the south-western Madrid region, totaling more than 600 cases until 2015. Some hosts, such as human, domestic dog and cat, rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and hare (Lepus granatensis), were found infected by the parasite of this disease in the area. Hares were described as the most important reservoir due to their higher prevalence, capacity to infect the vector, and presence of the same strains as in humans. Various measures were adopted to prevent and control the disease, and since 2013 there was a slight decline in the human sickness. We used a mathematical model to evaluate the efficacy of each measure in reducing the number of infected hosts. We identified in the present model that culling both hares and rabbits, without immediate reposition of the animals, was the best measure adopted, decreasing the proportion of all infected hosts. Particularly, culling hares was more efficacious than culling rabbits to reduce the proportion of infected individuals of all hosts. Likewise, lowering vector contact with hares highly influenced the reduction of the proportion of infected hosts. The reduction of the vector density per host in the park decreased the leishmaniasis incidence of hosts in the park and the urban areas. On the other hand, the reduction of the vector density per host of the urban area (humans, dogs and cats) decreased only their affected population, albeit at a higher proportion. The use of insecticide-impregnated collar and vaccination in dogs affected only the infected dogs’ population. The parameters related to the vector contact with dog, cat or human do not present a high impact on the other hosts infected by Leishmania. In conclusion, the efficacy of each control strategy was determined, in order to direct future actions in this and in other similar outbreaks. The present mathematical model was able to reproduce the leishmaniasis dynamics in the Madrid outbreak, providing theoretical support based on successful experiences, such as the reduction of human cases in Southwest Madrid, Spain."
https://openalex.org/W2763625413,"Study objectives Trefoil factor family (TFF) peptides belong to the family of mucin-associated peptides and are expressed in most mucosal surfaces. TFF peptides carry out functions such as proliferation and migration enhancement, anti-apoptosis, and wound healing. Moreover, TFFs are associated with mucins and interact with them as “linker peptides”, thereby influencing mucus viscosity. To test the hypothesis that in rhonchopathy and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) changes occur in the expression of TFF3 and -2 that could contribute to changes in mucus viscosity, leading to an increase in upper airway resistance during breathing. Methods RT-PCR, Western-blot, immunohistochemistry and ELISA were performed to detect and quantify TFF3 and -2 in uvula samples. In addition, 99 saliva samples from patients with mild, moderate or severe OSA, as well as samples from rhonchopathy patients and from healthy volunteers, were analyzed by ELISA. Results TFF3 was detected in all uvula samples. Immunohistochemistry revealed a subjectively decreasing antibody reactivity of the uvula epithelia with increasing disease severity. ELISA demonstrated significantly higher TFF3 saliva protein concentrations in the healthy control group compared to cases with rhonchopathy and OSA. Predisposing factors of OSA such as BMI or age showed no correlation with TFF3. No significant changes were observed with regard to TFF2. Conclusions The results suggest the involvement of TFF3 in the pathogenesis of rhonchopathy and OSA and lead to the hypothesis that reduction of TFF3 production by the epithelium and subepithelial mucous glands of the uvula contribute to an increase in breathing resistance due to a change in mucus organization."
https://openalex.org/W2762440966,"Multiple myeloma (MM), a malignancy of the bone marrow, is characterized by a pathological increase in antibody-producing plasma cells and an increase in immunoglobulins (plasmacytosis). In recent years, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been reported to be activators of apoptotic cell death in neoplastic B cells in MM. Here, we use bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) to show that the ""apoptotic"" effect of BMPs on human neoplastic B cells is dominated by anti-proliferative activities and cell cycle arrest and is apoptosis-independent. The anti-proliferative effect of BMP2 was analysed in the human cell lines KMS12-BM and L363 using WST-1 and a Coulter counter and was confirmed using CytoTox assays with established inhibitors of programmed cell death (zVAD-fmk and necrostatin-1). Furthermore, apoptotic activity was compared in both cell lines employing western blot analysis for caspase 3 and 8 in cells treated with BMP2 and FasL. Additionally, expression profiles of marker genes of different cell death pathways were analysed in both cell lines after stimulation with BMP2 for 48h using an RT-PCR-based array. In our experiments we observed that there was rather no reduction in absolute cell number, but cells stopped proliferating following treatment with BMP2 instead. The time frame (48–72 h) after BMP2 treatment at which a reduction in cell number is detectable is too long to indicate a directly BMP2-triggered apoptosis. Moreover, in comparison to robust apoptosis induced by the approved apoptotic factor FasL, BMP2 only marginally induced cell death. Consistently, neither the known inhibitor of apoptotic cell death zVAD-fmk nor the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 was able to rescue myeloma cell growth in the presence of BMP2."

Here, we investigated the effects of the headgroups of the 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl glycerophospholipids phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase embedded into a nanodisc, a lipid-bilayer construct harboring the specific lipid. We found that Ca2+-ATPase activity in a PC bilayer is comparable with that of SR vesicles and is suppressed in the other phospholipids, especially in PS. Ca2+ affinity at the high-affinity transport sites in PC was similar to that of SR vesicles, but 2–3-fold reduced in PE and PS. Ca2+ on- and off-rates in the non-phosphorylated ATPase were markedly reduced in PS. Rate-limiting phosphoenzyme (EP) conformational transition in 0.1 m KCl was as rapid in PC as in SR vesicles, but slowed in other phospholipids, especially in PS. Using kinetic plots of the logarithm of rate versus the square of mean activity coefficient of solutes in 0.1–1 m KCl, we noted that PC is optimal for the EP transition, but PG and especially PS had markedly unfavorable electrostatic effects, and PE exhibited a strong non-electrostatic restriction. Thus, the major SR membrane lipid PC is optimal for all steps and, unlike the other headgroups, contributes favorable electrostatics and non-electrostatic elements during the EP transition. Our analyses further revealed that the surface charge of the lipid bilayer directly modulates the transition rate."

We have developed Specvis, a free and open-source application written in Java programming language that can run on any personal computer to meet this requirement (http://www.specvis.pl/). Specvis was tested on glaucomatous, retinitis pigmentosa and stroke patients and the results were compared to results using the Medmont M700 Automated Static Perimeter. The application was also tested for inter-test intrapersonal variability. The results from both validation studies indicated low inter-test intrapersonal variability, and suitable reliability for a fast and simple assessment of visual field impairment. Specvis easily identifies visual field areas of zero sensitivity and allows for evaluation of its levels throughout the visual field. Thus, Specvis is a new, reliable application that can be successfully used for visual field examination and can fill the gap between confrontation and perimetry tests. The main advantages of Specvis over existing methods are its availability (free), affordability (runs on any personal computer), and reliability (comparable to high-cost solutions)."
https://openalex.org/W2763942011,"Gene expression (GE) analyses on blood samples from marathon and half-marathon runners have reported significant impacts on the immune and inflammatory systems. An ultra-marathon trail (UMT) represents a greater effort due to its more testing conditions. For the first time, we report the genome-wide GE profiling in a group of 16 runners participating in an 82 km UMT competition. We quantified their differential GE profile before and after the race using HuGene2.0st microarrays (Affymetrix Inc., California, US). The results obtained were decomposed by means of an independent component analysis (ICA) targeting independent expression modes. We observed significant differences in the expression levels of 5,084 protein coding genes resulting in an overrepresentation of 14% of the human biological pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. These were mainly clustered on terms related with protein synthesis repression, altered immune system and infectious diseases related mechanisms. In a second analysis, 27 out of the 196 transcriptional regulators (TRs) included in the Open Regulatory Annotation database were overrepresented. Among these TRs, we identified transcription factors from the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) family EPAS1 (p< 0.01) and HIF1A (p<0.001), and others jointly described in the gluconeogenesis program such as HNF4 (p< 0.001), EGR1 (p<0.001), CEBPA (p< 0.001) and a highly specific TR, YY1 (p<0.01). The five independent components, obtained from ICA, further revealed a down-regulation of 10 genes distributed in the complex I, III and V from the electron transport chain. This mitochondrial activity reduction is compatible with HIF-1 system activation. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, known to be regulated by HIF, also emerged (p<0.05). Additionally, and related to the brain rewarding circuit, the endocannabinoid signalling pathway was overrepresented (p<0.05)."
https://openalex.org/W2762407930,"Perimetry testing is an automated method to measure visual function and is heavily used for diagnosing ophthalmic and neurological conditions. Its working principle is to sequentially query a subject about perceived light using different brightness levels at different visual field locations. At a given location, this query-patient-feedback process is expected to converge at a perceived sensitivity, such that a shown stimulus intensity is observed and reported 50% of the time. Given this inherently time-intensive and noisy process, fast testing strategies are necessary in order to measure existing regions more effectively and reliably. In this work, we present a novel meta-strategy which relies on the correlative nature of visual field locations in order to strongly reduce the necessary number of locations that need to be examined. To do this, we sequentially determine locations that most effectively reduce visual field estimation errors in an initial training phase. We then exploit these locations at examination time and show that our approach can easily be combined with existing perceived sensitivity estimation schemes to speed up the examinations. Compared to state-of-the-art strategies, our approach shows marked performance gains with a better accuracy-speed trade-off regime for both mixed and sub-populations."

In an earlier trial, Papua New Guinean (PNG) children at high risk of pneumococcal disease were randomized to receive 0 or 3 doses of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), followed by a single dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) at 9 months of age. We here studied in a non-randomized follow-up trial the persistence of pneumococcal immunity in these children at 3–5 years of age (n = 132), and in 121 community controls of a similar age with no prior pneumococcal vaccination.


Methods 
Circulating IgG antibody titers to all PCV7 and PPV23-only serotypes 2, 5 and 7F were measured before and after challenge with 1/5th of a normal PPV23 dose. Serotype-specific memory B-cells were enumerated at 10 months and 3–5 years of age for a subgroup of study children.


Results 
Serotype-specific IgG antibody titers before and after challenge were similar for children who received PCV7/PPV23, PPV23 only, or no pneumococcal vaccines. Before challenge, at least 89% and 59% of children in all groups had serotype-specific titers ≥ 0.35μg/ml and ≥ 1.0 μg/ml, respectively. Post-challenge antibody titers were higher or similar to pre-challenge titers for most children independent of pneumococcal vaccination history. The rise in antibody titers was significantly lower when pre-challenge titers were higher. Overall the relative number of serotype-specific memory B-cells remained the same or increased between 10 months and 3–5 years of age, and there were no differences in serotype-specific memory B-cell numbers at 3–5 years of age between the three groups.


Conclusions 
Immunity induced by PCV7 and/or PPV23 immunization in infancy does not exceed that of naturally acquired immunity in 3-5-year-old children living in a highly endemic area. Also, there was no evidence that PPV23 immunization in the first year of life following PCV7 priming induces longer-term hypo-responsiveness.

https://openalex.org/W2764302700,"Horse urine is easily collected and contains molecules readily measurable using mass spectrometry that can be used as biomarkers representative of health, disease or drug tampering. This study aimed at analyzing microliter levels of horse urine to purify, identify and quantify proteins, polar metabolites and non-polar lipids. Urine from a healthy 12 year old quarter horse mare on a diet of grass hay and vitamin/mineral supplements with limited pasture access was collected for serial-omics characterization. The urine was treated with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and methanol to partition into three distinct layers for protein, non-polar lipid and polar metabolite content from a single liquid-liquid extraction and was repeated two times. Each layer was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography—high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to obtain protein sequence and relative protein levels as well as identify and quantify small polar metabolites and lipids. The results show 46 urine proteins, many related to normal kidney function, structural and circulatory proteins as well as 474 small polar metabolites but only 10 lipid molecules. Metabolites were mostly related to urea cycle and ammonia recycling as well as amino acid related pathways, plant diet specific molecules, etc. The few lipids represented triglycerides and phospholipids. These data show a complete mass spectrometry based—omics characterization of equine urine from a single 333 μL mid-stream urine aliquot. These omics data help serve as a baseline for healthy mare urine composition and the analyses can be used to monitor disease progression, health status, monitor drug use, etc."
https://openalex.org/W2761469625,"What is the function of sleep in humans? One claim is that sleep consolidates learning. Slow wave activity (SWA), i.e. slow oscillations of frequency < 4 Hz, has been observed in electroencephalograms (EEG) during sleep; it increases with prior wakefulness and decreases with sleep. Studies have claimed that increase in SWA in specific regions of the sleeping brain is correlated with overnight improved performance, i.e. overnight consolidation, on a demanding motor learning task. We wondered if SWA change during sleep is attributable to overnight consolidation or to metabolic demand. Participants executed out-and-back movements to a target using a pen-like cursor with their dominant hand while the target and cursor position were displayed on a screen. They trained on three different conditions on separate nights, differing in the amount and degree of rotation between the actual hand movement direction and displayed cursor movement direction. In the no-rotation (NR) condition, there was no rotation. In the single rotation (SR) condition, the amount of rotation remained the same throughout, and performance improved both across pre-sleep training and after sleep, i.e. overnight consolidation occurred; in the random rotation (RR) condition, the amount of rotation varied randomly from trial to trial, and no overnight consolidation occurred; SR and RR were cognitively demanding. The average EEG power density of SWA for the first 30 min. of non-rapid eye movement sleep after training was computed. Both SR and RR elicited increase in SWA in the parietal region; furthermore, the topographic distribution of SWA in each was remarkably similar. No correlation was found between the overnight performance improvement on SR and the SWA change in the parietal region on measures of learning. Our results argue that regulation of SWA in early sleep is associated with high levels of cognitive effort during prior wakefulness, and not just overnight consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2763450043,"Generic delimitation in the Beilschmiedia group of the Lauraceae remains ambiguous because flowering specimens of a few genera with confined distribution are poorly represented in herbaria, and a few floral characters important for taxonomy are still poorly known. Syndiclis is sporadically distributed in southwestern China, and is represented in the herbaria by only a few flowering specimens. We conducted field investigations to collect floral materials of four species and observed structures and ontogeny of the tiny flowers using both light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the genus Syndiclis possesses flowers with huge variation in both merosity and organ number. Flowers of the genus are dimerous, trimerous, or tetramerous, or have mixed merosity with monomerous and dimerous, or dimerous and trimerous, or trimerous and tetramerous whorls. The number of staminodes ranges from two to eight, depending on floral merosity, and on how many stamens of the third androecial whorl are reduced to staminodes. The staminodes of the fourth androecial whorl are comparable to the staminodes in Potameia, but the staminodes of the third androecial whorl of Syndiclis are relatively larger than the staminodes in Potameia. They are erect or curved inwards, covering the ovary. The anthers are usually two-locular, but rarely one-locular or three-locular. Each stamen of the third androecial whorl bears two conspicuous and enlarged glands at the base. The lability of floral merosity and organ number of Syndiclis may have been caused by changes of pollination system and loss of special selective pressures that are present in most Lauraceous plants with fixed floral organ number. This study furthers our understanding of variation and evolution of a few important characters of the Beilschmiedia group and provides essential data for a revised generic classification of the group."
https://openalex.org/W2762578359,"Both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) diseases are related to the genetic and environmental factors, causing damage to the skin. The mutations of keratin 1 gene (KRT1) were reported to associate with skin diseases. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs14024) and the indel polymorphism (cds-indel, rs267607656), consisting mostly of the common haplotypes and could be used for genotyping of KRT1. We used the PCR with sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) to determine the genotype of KRT1 in 164 SLE, 99 SSc patients, and 418 healthy controls. The results showed that the mutant with G at SNP rs14024 was associated with the high risk to SLE (p = 6.48×10−5) and SSc (p = 8.75×10−5), while the deletion allele at rs267607656 was associated with the low risk to SSc (p = 4.89×10−4) comparing to the normal controls. Haplogenotype, Del-/MU+ was associated with high susceptibility to SLE (OR = 1.87, p = 0.001) and SSc (OR = 2.29, p = 2.34×10−4). In contrast, the Haplogenotype Del+/MU- was associated with resistance to SLE (OR = 0.35, p = 6.24×10−5) and SSc (OR = 0.34, p = 0.001). This study demonstrates that the variations in KRT1 and the specific polymorphism of KRT1 in this Chinese Han population are associated with autoimmune diseases SLE and SSc. Typing KRT1 might be helpful to identify SLE and SSc patients."
https://openalex.org/W2762689865,"Capping of nascent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts is required for gene expression and the first two steps are catalyzed by separate 5' triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities of the human capping enzyme (HCE). The cap is added co-transcriptionally, but how the two activities are coordinated is unclear. Our previous in vitro work has suggested that an unidentified factor modulates the minimum length at which nascent transcripts can be capped. Using the same well-established in vitro system with hydrogen peroxide as a capping inhibitor, we show that this unidentified factor targets the guanylyltransferase activity of HCE. We also uncover the mechanism of HCE inhibition by hydrogen peroxide, and by using mass spectrometry demonstrate that the active site cysteine residue of the HCE triphosphatase domain becomes oxidized. Using recombinant proteins for the two separated HCE domains, we provide evidence that the triphosphatase normally acts on transcripts shorter than can be acted upon by the guanylyltransferase. Our further characterization of the capping reaction dependence on transcript length and its interaction with the unidentified modulator of capping raises the interesting possibility that the capping reaction could be regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2761916544,"Impaired working memory (WM) is a core cognitive deficit in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, past studies have reported that patients may also benefit from increasing salience of memory stimuli. Such efficient encoding largely depends upon precise perception. Thus an investigation on the relationship between perceptual processing and WM would be worthwhile. Here, we used biological motion (BM), a socially relevant stimulus that schizophrenics have difficulty discriminating from similar meaningless motions, in a delayed-response task. Non-BM stimuli and static polygons were also used for comparison. In each trial, one of the three types of stimuli was presented followed by two probes, with a short delay in between. Participants were asked to indicate whether one of them was identical to the memory item or both were novel. The number of memory items was one or two. Healthy controls were more accurate in recognizing BM than non-BM regardless of memory loads. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited similar accuracy patterns to those of controls in the Load 1 condition only. These results suggest that information contained in BM could facilitate WM encoding in general, but the effect is vulnerable to the increase of cognitive load in schizophrenia, implying inefficient encoding driven by imprecise perception."
