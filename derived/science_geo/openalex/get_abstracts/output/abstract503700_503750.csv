https://openalex.org/W2011044564,"The recent past years have seen a noticeable increase of interest for electroencephalography (EEG) to analyze functional connectivity through brain sources reconstructed from scalp signals. Although considerable advances have been done both on the recording and analysis of EEG signals, a number of methodological questions are still open regarding the optimal way to process the data in order to identify brain networks. In this paper, we analyze the impact of three factors that intervene in this processing: i) the number of scalp electrodes, ii) the combination between the algorithm used to solve the EEG inverse problem and the algorithm used to measure the functional connectivity and iii) the frequency bands retained to estimate the functional connectivity among neocortical sources. Using High-Resolution (hr) EEG recordings in healthy volunteers, we evaluated these factors on evoked responses during picture recognition and naming task. The main reason for selection this task is that a solid literature background is available about involved brain networks (ground truth). From this a priori information, we propose a performance criterion based on the number of connections identified in the regions of interest (ROI) that belong to potentially activated networks. Our results show that the three studied factors have a dramatic impact on the final result (the identified network in the source space) as strong discrepancies were evidenced depending on the methods used. They also suggest that the combination of weighted Minimum Norm Estimator (wMNE) and the Phase Synchronization (PS) methods applied on High-Resolution EEG in beta/gamma bands provides the best performance in term of topological distance between the identified network and the expected network in the above-mentioned cognitive task."
https://openalex.org/W2064587535,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strains belong to a category that is associated with colibacillosis, a serious illness in the poultry industry worldwide. Additionally, some APEC groups have recently been described as potential zoonotic agents. In this work, we compared APEC strains with extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains isolated from clinical cases of humans with extra-intestinal diseases such as urinary tract infections (UTI) and bacteremia. PCR results showed that genes usually found in the ColV plasmid (tsh, iucA, iss, and hlyF) were associated with APEC strains while fyuA, irp-2, fepC sitDchrom, fimH, crl, csgA, afa, iha, sat, hlyA, hra, cnf1, kpsMTII, clpVSakai and malX were associated with human ExPEC. Both categories shared nine serogroups (O2, O6, O7, O8, O11, O19, O25, O73 and O153) and seven sequence types (ST10, ST88, ST93, ST117, ST131, ST155, ST359, ST648 and ST1011). Interestingly, ST95, which is associated with the zoonotic potential of APEC and is spread in avian E. coli of North America and Europe, was not detected among 76 APEC strains. When the strains were clustered based on the presence of virulence genes, most ExPEC strains (71.7%) were contained in one cluster while most APEC strains (63.2%) segregated to another. In general, the strains showed distinct genetic and fingerprint patterns, but avian and human strains of ST359, or ST23 clonal complex (CC), presented more than 70% of similarity by PFGE. The results demonstrate that some ""zoonotic-related"" STs (ST117, ST131, ST10CC, ST23CC) are present in Brazil. Also, the presence of moderate fingerprint similarities between ST359 E. coli of avian and human origin indicates that strains of this ST are candidates for having zoonotic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2023499027,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, a superfamily of ion channels, can be divided into 7 subfamilies, including TRPV, TRPC, TRPP, and 4 others. Functional TRP channels are tetrameric complexes consisting of 4 pore-forming subunits. The purpose of this study was to explore the heteromerization of TRP subunits crossing different TRP subfamilies. Two-step coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) were used to determine the interaction of the different TRP subunits. Patch-clamp and cytosolic Ca2+ measurements were used to determine the functional role of the ion channels in flow conditions. The analysis demonstrated the formation of a heteromeric TRPV4-C1-P2 complex in primary cultured rat mesenteric artery endothelial cells (MAECs) and HEK293 cells that were cotransfected with TRPV4, TRPC1, and TRPP2. In functional experiments, pore-dead mutants for each of these 3 TRP isoforms nearly abolished the flow-induced cation currents and Ca2+ increase, suggesting that all 3 TRPs contribute to the ion permeation pore of the channels. We identified the first heteromeric TRP channels composed of subunits from 3 different TRP subfamilies. Functionally, this heteromeric TRPV4-C1-P2 channel mediates the flow-induced Ca2+ increase in native vascular endothelial cells.—Du, J., Ma, X., Shen, B., Huang, Y., Birnbaumer, L., Yao, X., TRPV4, TRPC1, and TRPP2 assemble to form a flow-sensitive heteromeric channel.

https://openalex.org/W1971854206,"Adverse maternal environments can lead to increased fetal exposure to maternal cortisol, which can cause infant neurobehavioral deficits. The placenta regulates fetal cortisol exposure and response, and placental DNA methylation can influence this function. FK506 binding protein (FKBP5) is a negative regulator of cortisol response, FKBP5 methylation has been linked to brain morphology and mental disorder risk, and genetic variation of FKBP5 was associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in adults. We hypothesized that placental FKBP5 methylation and genetic variation contribute to gene expression control, and are associated with infant neurodevelopmental outcomes assessed using the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS). In 509 infants enrolled in the Rhode Island Child Health Study, placental FKBP5 methylation was measured at intron 7 using quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing. Placental FKBP5 mRNA was measured in a subset of 61 infants by quantitative PCR, and the SNP rs1360780 was genotyped using a quantitative allelic discrimination assay. Relationships between methylation, expression and NNNS scores were examined using linear models adjusted for confounding variables, then logistic models were created to determine the influence of methylation on membership in high risk groups of infants. FKBP5 methylation was negatively associated with expression (P = 0.08, r = −0.22); infants with the TT genotype had higher expression than individuals with CC and CT genotypes (P = 0.06), and those with CC genotype displayed a negative relationship between methylation and expression (P = 0.06, r = −0.43). Infants in the highest quartile of FKBP5 methylation had increased risk of NNNS high arousal compared to infants in the lowest quartile (OR 2.22, CI 1.07–4.61). TT genotype infants had increased odds of high NNNS stress abstinence (OR 1.98, CI 0.92–4.26). Placental FKBP5 methylation reduces expression in a genotype specific fashion, and genetic variation supersedes this effect. These genetic and epigenetic differences in expression may alter the placenta’s ability to modulate cortisol response and exposure, leading to altered neurobehavioral outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1979540468,"A shift towards early morning biting behavior of the major malaria vector Anopheles funestus have been observed in two villages in south Benin following distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), but the impact of these changes on the personal protection efficacy of LLINs was not evaluated. Data from human and An. funestus behavioral surveys were used to measure the human exposure to An. funestus bites through previously described mathematical models. We estimated the personal protection efficacy provided by LLINs and the proportions of exposure to bite occurring indoors and/or in the early morning. Average personal protection provided by using of LLIN was high (≥80% of the total exposure to bite), but for LLIN users, a large part of remaining exposure occurred outdoors (45.1% in Tokoli-V and 68.7% in Lokohoué) and/or in the early morning (38.5% in Tokoli-V and 69.4% in Lokohoué). This study highlights the crucial role of LLIN use and the possible need to develop new vector control strategies targeting malaria vectors with outdoor and early morning biting behavior. This multidisciplinary approach that supplements entomology with social science and mathematical modeling illustrates just how important it is to assess where and when humans are actually exposed to malaria vectors before vector control program managers, policy-makers and funders conclude what entomological observations imply."
https://openalex.org/W1996468996,"Predicting habitat suitability under climate change is vital to conserving biodiversity. However, current species distribution models rely on coarse scale climate data, whereas fine scale microclimate data may be necessary to assess habitat suitability and generate predictive models. Here, we evaluate disparities between temperature data at the coarse scale from weather stations versus fine-scale data measured in microhabitats required for a climate-sensitive mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps). We collected two years of temperature data in occupied talus habitats predicted to be suitable (high elevation) and unsuitable (low elevation) by the bioclimatic envelope approach. At low elevations, talus surface and interstitial microclimates drastically differed from ambient temperatures measured on-site and at a nearby weather station. Interstitial talus temperatures were frequently decoupled from high ambient temperatures, resulting in instantaneous disparities of over 30°C between these two measurements. Microhabitat temperatures were also highly heterogeneous, such that temperature measurements within the same patch of talus were not more correlated than measurements at distant patches. An experimental manipulation revealed that vegetation cover may cool the talus surface by up to 10°C during the summer, which may contribute to this spatial heterogeneity. Finally, low elevation microclimates were milder and less variable than typical alpine habitat, suggesting that, counter to species distribution model predictions, these seemingly unsuitable habitats may actually be better refugia for this species under climate change. These results highlight the importance of fine-scale microhabitat data in habitat assessments and underscore the notion that some critical refugia may be counterintuitive."
https://openalex.org/W2025087466,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by nonspecific inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Recent investigations suggest that activation of Th17 cells and/or deficiency of regulatory T cells (Treg) is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is a protein with a wide range of anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory function, which exerts significantly protective roles in various T cell-mediated diseases. In this study, we aim to explore the immunological regulation of HO-1 in the dextran sulfate sodium-induced model of experimental murine colitis. BALB/c mice were administered 4% dextran sulfate sodium orally; some mice were intraperitoneally pretreated with HO-1 inducer hemin or HO-1 inhibitor stannum protoporphyrin IX. The results show that hemin enhances the colonic expression of HO-1 and significantly ameliorates the symptoms of colitis with improved histological changes, accompanied by a decreased proportion of Th17 cells and increased number of Tregs in mesenteric lymph node and spleen. Moreover, induction of HO-1 down-regulates retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt expression and IL-17A levels, while promoting Treg-related forkhead box p3 (Foxp3) expression and IL-10 levels in colon. Further study in vitro revealed that up-regulated HO-1 switched the naive T cells to Tregs when cultured under a Th17-inducing environment, which involved in IL-6R blockade. Therefore, HO-1 may exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in the murine model of acute experimental colitis via regulating the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, thus providing a possible novel therapeutic target in IBD.

Carding S.R. Inflammatory bowel disease: cause and immunobiology.Lancet. 2007; 369: 1627-1640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Although the pathogenesis of IBD is still unclear, evidence has indicated that IBD is induced by abnormal T cell immune responses triggered by an inflammatory response to intestinal microorganisms in individuals with susceptible genes (2.Boirivant M.

Gastroenterol. 2010; 55: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The abnormal immune response results in excessive activation of effector T cell subsets and/or deficiency of regulatory T cells (Treg), leading to persistent immune disorders and uncontrolled intestinal inflammation (4.Eastaff-Leung N.

Th17 cells, as a recently discovered T cell subset involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory disease, require specific cytokines and transcription factors for their differentiation, in which IL-6 and TGF-β are recognized as crucial factors (9.Stockinger B.

Moreover, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) is the key transcription factor modulating the Th17 lineage (10.O'Connor Jr., W. Zenewicz L.A. Flavell R.A.

As one of the defense mechanisms developing in our immune system, Tregs are responsible for maintaining immune homeostasis and suppressing intestinal inflammation resulting from aberrant immune responses to self-antigens and commensal bacteria (17.Huibregtse I.L. van Lent A.U. van Deventer S.J.

However, little is known about how HO-1 exerts immune regulatory effects under different inflammatory conditions. Thus, this study aims to further explore the protective effects of HO-1 and the underlying mechanisms involved in regulating the Th17/Treg cell balance in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine model of acute experimental colitis. Female BALB/c mice (6∼8 weeks old) were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. and maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions in the Research Center for Experimental Medicine of Ruijin Hospital, affiliated with the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. All animal experiments were approved by and performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital (Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine). Mice were randomly divided into four groups, including the DSS, DSS+hemin, DSS+SnPP, and control groups (n = 6 in each group). Mice in the DSS, DSS+hemin, and DSS+SnPP groups were fed with 4% (w/v) DSS (MP Biochemicals) in drinking water and normal water in the control group from day 0. Mice were intraperitoneally administered 75 µmol/kg of hemin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 75 µmol/kg of SnPP (Porphyrin Products) on days −2 and −1 in the DSS+hemin and the DSS+SnPP groups, respectively. Hemin or SnPP was dissolved in 0.2 mol/liter NaOH, titrated to pH 7.4 with 0.2 mol/liter HCl, and then diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). We evaluated the severity of colitis by the daily monitoring of clinical manifestations such as weight loss, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding, and scoring disease activity index as described previously (Table 1) (38.Takagi T.

Mice were anesthetized and sacrificed at the end of the experiment (day 7), and the colons, spleens, and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) were harvested for further assays.TABLE 1The DAI scoresWeight loss (%)aFive grades of weight loss (0, no loss or weight gain; 1, 1–5% loss; 2, 5–10% loss; 3, 10–20% loss; 4, >20% loss).Stool consistencybThree grades of stool consistency (0, normal; 2, loose; and 4, diarrhea).Occult bloodcThree grades of occult blood (0, negative; 2, occult blood-positive; and 4, gross bleeding).Score0NormalNegative01∼515∼10LooseOccult blood-positive210∼203>20DiarrheaGross bleeding4a Five grades of weight loss (0, no loss or weight gain; 1, 1–5% loss; 2, 5–10% loss; 3, 10–20% loss; 4, >20% loss).b Three grades of stool consistency (0, normal; 2, loose; and 4, diarrhea).c Three grades of occult blood (0, negative; 2, occult blood-positive; and 4, gross bleeding). Open table in a new tab Colons were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Four-micrometer-thick sections were stained with H&E. Colonic inflammation was assessed under the light microscope (Olympus AX70) according to the degree of epithelial erosion, ulceration, vascular density, and leukocyte infiltration. Colons were homogenized with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) containing protease inhibitors. The extracts containing 30 µg of proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 (TBST) buffer containing 5% skim milk and incubated with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-mouse RORγt IgG and rabbit anti-mouse Foxp3 IgG (1/1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-mouse HO-1 IgG (1/1000 dilution, Cell Signaling). The samples were incubated overnight followed by addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1/5000 dilution, Cell Signaling). The signals were visualized via enhanced chemiluminescence using a Thermo ECL kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HO-1 enzyme activity was assessed by measuring bilirubin production as described previously with modifications (36.Varga C. Laszlo F. Fritz P. Cavicchi M. Lamarque D. Horvath K. Posa A. Berko A. Whittle B.J. Modulation by heme and zinc protoporphyrin of colonic heme oxygenase-1 and experimental inflammatory bowel disease in the rat.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 561: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The colons were homogenized in 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 32 mmol/liter sucrose, 1 mmol/liter dithiotreitol (DTT), 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 10 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 2 µg/ml aprotinin and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used to measure HO activity. The reaction mixture, consisting of 200 µl of sample homogenate, 100 µl of normal liver cytosol (source of biliverdin reductase), 20 µmol/liter hemin, and 0.8 mmol/liter NADPH, was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The optical density (OD) was measured between 464 and 530 nm (extinction coefficient, 40 mmol/liter/cm for bilirubin) to assess bilirubin production once the reaction was terminated by putting samples in an ice bath. Values were expressed as pmol of bilirubin formed per hour per milligram protein. MLNs and spleens were removed. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by passing the tissue through a nylon mesh (70-µm pore size). Erythrocytes were lysed with hypotonic buffer (0.15 mol/liter NH4Cl, 10 mmol/liter KHCO3, 0.1 mmol/liter Na2EDTA). Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone) supplemented with 1% l-glutamine (0.2 mol/liter), 10% FCS, 100 international units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 1% HEPES (1 mol/liter), 1% sodium hydrogen carbonate (100 mmol/liter), and 0.1% 2-β-mercaptoethanol (50 mmol/liter, Invitrogen) in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) for 48 h. Cells were collected and analyzed using flow cytometry (FCM). Cytokine production in culture supernatants was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Spleens from 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were removed and minced with a nylon mesh (70-µm pore size). After the cells were pelleted, erythrocytes were lysed with hypotonic buffer. Naive CD4+ T cells were purified via magnetic isolation (MiltenyiBiotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 per well in 48-well plates and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone) supplemented with 1% l-glutamine (0.2 mol/liter), 10% FCS, 100 international units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 1% HEPES (1 mol/liter), 1% sodium hydrogen carbonate (100 mmol/liter) and 0.1% 2-β-mercaptoethanol (50 mmol/liter, Invitrogen). The cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (2 µg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 (2 µg/ml) antibodies (eBioscience). Th-neutral conditions (Th0) included no exogenous cytokines or anti-cytokines. For Th17 differentiation, cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml, Cell Signaling), IL-6 (50 ng/ml, R&D Systems), IL-23 (20 ng/ml, R&D Systems), anti-IFN-γ (10 µg/ml, Biolegend), and anti-IL-4 (10 µg/ml, Biolegend). Hemin and SnPP were dissolved in 0.2 mol/liter NaOH at a concentration of 50 µmol/ml and added to cultures at an appropriate concentration of 30 nmol/ml. After 5 days, cells were collected for FCM analysis and RNA extraction. For detection of IL-6R, Th17, and Treg cells, cells were stimulated with lymphocyte activator mixture (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin/brefeldin A, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 5 h and labeled with surface markers FITC anti-CD4 mAb, APC anti-CD25 mAb and PE anti-IL-6R mAb (eBioscience). After washing, fixing, and permeabilizing according to the manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience), cells were labeled intracellularly with PE-Cy7 anti-IL-17 mAb (Biolegend) or APC anti-IL-10 mAb and PE anti-Foxp3 mAb (eBioscience). All labeled cells were detected using FCM on the FACScan Flow Analyzer. The data were analyzed with FlowJo software (version 7.6). The concentrations of IL-17A and IL-6 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) in colonic homogenates or cell culture supernatant were analyzed with ELISA kits in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions. Colons and spleens were removed and cells cultivated in vitro were collected and homogenized to extract total RNA with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Invitrogen, Carlsbab, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa, Japan) to obtain cDNA samples. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using an ABI Prism 7300 (Applied Biosystems) with the following program: 95 °C for 10 s and 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 31 s, and 95 °C for 15 s, and finally, 60 °C for 30 s and 95 °C for 15 s. Relative levels of target mRNA were compared with β-actin using the 2−ΔΔCt method. All primers were synthesized by Shanghai Shengon Biotech Company (Shanghai, China). Sequences were as follows: β-actin, 5′-GGC TGT ATT CCC CTC CAT CG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCA GTT GGT AAC AAT GCC ATG T-3′ (reverse); Foxp3, 5′-CAC AAT ATG CGA CCC CCT TTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAC ATG CGA GTA AAC CAA TGG TA-3′ (reverse); RORγt, 5′-GAC CCA CAC CTC ACA AAT TGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGT AGG CCA CAT TAC ACT GCT-3′ (reverse); IL-17A, 5′-TTT AAC TCC CTT GGC GCA AAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTT TCC CTC CGC ATT GAC AC-3′ (reverse); IL-6, 5′-TAG TCC TTC CTA CCC CAA TTT CC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTG GTC CTT AGC CAC TCC TTC-3′ (reverse); IL-10, 5′-AGA AGC ATG GCC CAG AAA TCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGC CTT GTA GAC ACC TTG GT-3′ (reverse); IL-6R, 5′-TGA ATA GAG ATG CCC GTC AG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGC TTG GAC TTT AGG AGT TCG-3′ (reverse); and HO-1, 5′-AAG CCG AGA ATG CTG AGT TCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCC GTG TAG ATA TGG TAC AAG GA-3′ (reverse).

HO-1 is the inducible one of the three HO isozymes (42.Bach F.H. Heme oxygenase-1 as a protective gene.Wien Klin. Wochenschr. 2002; 114: 1-3PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of HO-1 is up-regulated in response to cellular stress and by several factors, such as pro-oxidative stimuli, UV light, LPS, and heavy metals (28.Grochot-Przeczek A. Dulak J.

https://openalex.org/W2034532011,"Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles, and mitochondrial fission is a crucial step of apoptosis. Although Oma1 is believed to be responsible for long form Opa1 (L-Opa1) processing during mitochondrial fragmentation, whether and how Oma1 is involved in L-Opa1 processing and participates in the regulation of chemoresistance is unknown. Chemosensitive and chemoresistant ovarian (OVCA) and cervical (CECA) cancer cells were treated with cisplatin (CDDP). Mitochondrial dynamics and protein contents were assessed by immunofluorescence and Western blot, respectively. The requirements of Oma1 and p53 for CDDP-induced L-Opa1 processing, mitochondrial fragmentation, and apoptosis were examined by siRNA or cDNA. CDDP induces L-Opa1 processing and mitochondrial fragmentation in chemosensitive but not in chemoresistant cells. CDDP induced Oma1 40-kDa form increases in OV2008 cells, not in C13* cells. Oma1 knockdown inhibited L-Opa1 processing, mitochondrial fragmentation, and apoptosis. Silencing p53 expression attenuated the effects of CDDP in Oma1 (40 kDa) increase, L-Opa1 processing, mitochondrial fragmentation, and apoptosis in chemosensitive OVCA cells, whereas reconstitution of p53 in p53 mutant or null chemoresistant OVCA cells induced Oma1 (40 kDa) increase, L-Opa1 processing, mitochondrial fragmentation, and apoptosis irrespective of the presence of CDDP. Prohibitin 1 (Phb1) dissociates from Opa1-Phb1 complex and binds phosphorylated p53 (serine 15) in response to CDDP in chemosensitive but not chemoresistant CECA cells. These findings demonstrate that (a) p53 and Oma1 mediate L-Opa1 processing, (b) mitochondrial fragmentation is involved in CDDP-induced apoptosis in OVCA and CECA cells, and (c) dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics may in part be involved in the pathophysiology of CDDP resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1995691902,"Background Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is increasingly used as a cell culture supplement, in order to reduce the contact of human cells with animal-derived products during in vitro expansion. The effect of supplementation changes on cell growth and protein production is not fully characterized. Methods Human mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow, adipose tissue and Wharton's Jelly were isolated and cultured in PRP-supplemented media. Proliferation, in vitro differentiation, expression of cell surface markers, mRNA expression of key genes and protein secretion were quantified. Results 10% PRP sustained five to tenfold increased cell proliferation as compared to 10% fetal bovine serum. Regarding cell differentiation, PRP reduced adipogenic differentiation and increased calcium deposits in bone marrow and adipose tissue-mesenchymal stromal cells. Wharton's Jelly derived mesenchymal stromal cells secreted higher concentrations of chemokines and growth factors than other mesenchymal stromal cells when cultured in PRP-supplemented media. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells secreted higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic proteins. Mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from adipose tissue secreted higher amounts of extracellular matrix components. Conclusions Mesenchymal stromal cells purified from different tissues have distinct properties regarding differentiation, angiogenic, inflammatory and matrix remodeling potential when cultured in PRP supplemented media. These abilities should be further characterized in order to choose the best protocols for their therapeutic use."
https://openalex.org/W2050688486,"Anti-tumor immune responses have been linked to the regulated release of ATP from apoptotic cancer cells to engage P2 purinergic receptor signaling cascades in nearby leukocytes. We used the Jurkat T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia model to characterize the role of pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels in the release of nucleotides during chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. Diverse pro-apoptotic drugs, including topoisomerase II inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and proteosome inhibitors, induced functional activation of Panx1 channels via caspase-3-mediated cleavage of the Panx1 autoinhibitory C-terminal domain. The caspase-activated Panx1 channels mediated efflux of ATP, but also ADP and AMP, with the latter two comprising >90% of the released adenine nucleotide pool as cells transitioned from the early to late stages of apoptosis. Chemotherapeutic drugs also activated an alternative caspase- and Panx1-independent pathway for ATP release from Jurkat cells in the presence of benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor. Comparison of Panx1 levels indicated much higher expression in leukemic T lymphocytes than in normal, untransformed T lymphoblasts. This suggests that signaling roles for Panx1 may be amplified in leukemic leukocytes. Together, these results identify chemotherapy-activated pannexin-1 channels and ATP release as possible mediators of paracrine interaction between dying tumor cells and the effector leukocytes that mediate immunogenic anti-tumor responses."
https://openalex.org/W2159934866,"Coronins are involved in the regulation of actin dynamics in a multifaceted way, participating in cell migration and vesicular trafficking. Apicomplexan parasites, which exhibit an actin-dependent gliding motility that is essential for traversal through tissues, as well as invasion of and egress from host cells, express only a single coronin, whereas higher eukaryotes possess several isoforms. We set out to characterize the 3-D structure, biochemical function, subcellular localization, and genetic ablation of Toxoplasma gondii coronin (TgCOR), to shed light on its biological role. A combination of X-ray crystallography, small-angle scattering of X-rays, and light scattering revealed the atomic structure of the conserved WD40 domain and the dimeric arrangement of the full-length protein. TgCOR binds to F-actin and increases the rate and extent of actin polymerization. In vivo, TgCOR relocalizes transiently to the posterior pole of motile and invading parasites, independent of actin dynamics, but concomitant to microneme secretory organelle discharge. TgCOR contributes to, but is not essential for, invasion and egress. Taken together, our data point toward a role for TgCOR in stabilizing newly formed, short filaments and F-actin cross-linking, as well as functions linked to endocytosis and recycling of membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1988865934,"Decreased expression of diacylglycerol (DG) kinase (DGK) δ in skeletal muscles is closely related to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. To identify DG species that are phosphorylated by DGKδ in response to high glucose stimulation, we investigated high glucose-dependent changes in phosphatidic acid (PA) molecular species in mouse C2C12 myoblasts using a newly established liquid chromatography/MS method. We found that the suppression of DGKδ2 expression by DGKδ-specific siRNAs significantly inhibited glucose-dependent increases in 30:0-, 32:0-, and 34:0-PA and moderately attenuated 30:1-, 32:1-, and 34:1-PA. Moreover, overexpression of DGKδ2 also enhanced the production of these PA species. MS/MS analysis revealed that these PA species commonly contain palmitic acid (16:0). D609, an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), significantly inhibited the glucose-stimulated production of the palmitic acid-containing PA species. Moreover, PC-PLC was co-immunoprecipitated with DGKδ2. These results strongly suggest that DGKδ preferably metabolizes palmitic acid-containing DG species supplied from the PC-PLC pathway, but not arachidonic acid (20:4)-containing DG species derived from the phosphatidylinositol turnover, in response to high glucose levels."
https://openalex.org/W2011478885,"Carnosine, a naturally occurring dipeptide, has been recently demonstrated to possess anti-tumor activity. However, its underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of carnosine on the cell viability and proliferation of the cultured human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells. Carnosine treatment did not induce cell apoptosis or necrosis, but reduced the proliferative capacity of SGC-7901 cells. Seahorse analysis showed SGC-7901 cells cultured with pyruvate have active mitochondria, and depend on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation more than glycolysis pathway for generation of ATP. Carnosine markedly decreased the absolute value of mitochondrial ATP-linked respiration, and reduced the maximal oxygen consumption and spare respiratory capacity, which may reduce mitochondrial function correlated with proliferative potential. Simultaneously, carnosine also reduced the extracellular acidification rate and glycolysis of SGC-7901 cells. Our results suggested that carnosine is a potential regulator of energy metabolism of SGC-7901 cells both in the anaerobic and aerobic pathways, and provided a clue for preclinical and clinical evaluation of carnosine for gastric cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2036260484,"NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major transcription factor and acts as a key regulator of antioxidant genes to exogenous stimulations. The aim of current study was to determine whether Nrf2/ARE pathway is involved in the protective effect of electroacupuncture on the injured lung in a rabbit model of endotoxic shock. A dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 5 mg/kg was administered intravenously to replicate the model of acute lung injury induced by endotoxic shock. Electroacupuncture pretreatment was handled bilaterally at Zusanli and Feishu acupoints for five consecutive days while sham electroacupuncture punctured at non-acupoints. Fourty anesthetized New England male rabbits were randomized into normal control group (group C), LPS group (group L), electroacupuncture + LPS group (group EL) and sham electroacupuncture + LPS (group SEL). At 6 h after LPS administration, the animals were sacrificed and the blood samples were collected for biochemical measurements. The lungs were removed for calculation of wet-to-dry weight ratios (W/D), histopathologic examination, determination of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 protein and mRNA, Nrf2 total and nucleoprotein, as well as Nrf2 mRNA expression, and evaluation of the intracellular distribution of Nrf2 nucleoprotein. LPS caused extensive morphologic lung damage, which was lessened by electroacupuncture treatment. Besides, lung W/D ratios were significantly decreased, the level of malondialdehyde was inhibited, plasma levels of TNF-α and interleukin-6 were decreased, while the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase were enhanced in the electroacupucnture treated animals. In addition, electroacupuncture stimulation distinctly increased the expressions of HO-1 and Nrf2 protein including Nrf2 total protein and nucleoprotein as well as mRNA in lung tissue, while these effects were blunted in the sham electroacupuncture group. We concluded that electroacupuncture treatment at ST36 and BL13 effectively attenuates lung injury in a rabbit model of endotoxic shock through activation of Nrf2/ARE pathway and following up-regulation of HO-1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2113306815,"Background Low Emission Zones (LEZs) are areas where the most polluting vehicles are restricted from entering. The effectiveness of LEZs to lower ambient exposures is under debate. This study focused on LEZs that restricted cars of Euro 1 standard without appropriate retrofitting systems from entering and estimated LEZ effects on NO2, NO, and NOx ( = NO2+NO). Methods Continuous half-hour and diffuse sampler 4-week average NO2, NO, and NOx concentrations measured inside and outside LEZs in 17 German cities of 6 federal states (2005–2009) were analysed as matched quadruplets (two pairs of simultaneously measured index values inside LEZ and reference values outside LEZ, one pair measured before and one after introducing LEZs with time differences that equal multiples of 364 days) by multiple linear and log-linear fixed-effects regression modelling (covariables: e.g., wind velocity, amount of precipitation, height of inversion base, school holidays, truck-free periods). Additionally, the continuous half-hour data was collapsed into 4-week averages and pooled with the diffuse sampler data to perform joint analysis. Results More than 3,000,000 quadruplets of continuous measurements (half-hour averages) were identified at 38 index and 45 reference stations. Pooling with diffuse sampler data from 15 index and 10 reference stations lead to more than 4,000 quadruplets for joint analyses of 4-week averages. Mean LEZ effects on NO2, NO, and NOx concentrations (reductions) were estimated to be at most −2 µg/m3 (or −4%). The 4-week averages of NO2 concentrations at index stations after LEZ introduction were 55 µg/m3 (median and mean values) or 82 µg/m3 (95th percentile). Conclusions This is the first study investigating comprehensively the effectiveness of LEZs to reduce NO2, NO, and NOx concentrations controlling for most relevant potential confounders. Our analyses indicate that there is a statistically significant, but rather small reduction of NO2, NO, and NOx concentrations associated with LEZs."

https://openalex.org/W1991034549,"Phylogeography interprets molecular genetic variation in a spatial and temporal context. Molecular clocks are frequently used to calibrate phylogeographic analyses, however there is mounting evidence that molecular rates decay over the relevant timescales. It is therefore essential that an appropriate rate is determined, consistent with the temporal scale of the specific analysis. This can be achieved by using temporally spaced data such as ancient DNA or by relating the divergence of lineages directly to contemporaneous external events of known time. Here we calibrate a Eurasian field vole (Microtus agrestis) mitochondrial genealogy from the well-established series of post-glacial geophysical changes that led to the formation of the Baltic Sea and the separation of the Scandinavian peninsula from the central European mainland. The field vole exhibits the common phylogeographic pattern of Scandinavian colonization from both the north and the south, however the southernmost of the two relevant lineages appears to have originated in situ on the Scandinavian peninsula, or possibly in the adjacent island of Zealand, around the close of the Younger Dryas. The mitochondrial substitution rate and the timescale for the genealogy are closely consistent with those obtained with a previous calibration, based on the separation of the British Isles from mainland Europe. However the result here is arguably more certain, given the level of confidence that can be placed in one of the central assumptions of the calibration, that field voles could not survive the last glaciation of the southern part of the Scandinavian peninsula. Furthermore, the similarity between the molecular clock rate estimated here and those obtained by sampling heterochronous (ancient) DNA (including that of a congeneric species) suggest that there is little disparity between the measured genetic divergence and the population divergence that is implicit in our land-bridge calibration."

Outcome data in these patients are scarce.Clinical and radiological features were collected in 83 patients with ILD-associated acute respiratory failure (ARF). Determinants of hospital mortality and response to corticosteroid therapy were identified by logistic regression.Hospital and 1-year mortality rates were 41% and 54% respectively. Pulmonary hypertension, computed tomography (CT) fibrosis and acute kidney injury were independently associated with mortality (odds ratio (OR) 4.55; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) (1.20-17.33); OR, 7.68; (1.78-33.22) and OR 10.60; (2.25-49.97) respectively). Response to steroids was higher in patients with shorter time from hospital admission to corticosteroid therapy. Patients with fibrosis on CT had lower response to steroids (OR, 0.03; (0.005-0.21)). In mechanically ventilated patients, overdistension induced by high PEEP settings was associated with CT fibrosis and hospital mortality.Mortality is high in ILD-associated ARF. CT and echocardiography are valuable prognostic tools. Prompt corticosteroid therapy may improve survival."
https://openalex.org/W1968350828,"As key negative regulator of the p53 tumour suppressor, Mdm2 is an attractive therapeutic target. Small molecules such as Nutlin have been developed to antagonise Mdm2, resulting in p53-dependent death of tumour cells. We have recently described a mutation in Mdm2 (M62A), which precludes binding of Nutlin, but not p53. This Nutlin-resistant variant is not, however, refractory to binding and inhibition by stapled peptide antagonists targeting the same region of Mdm2. A detailed understanding of how stapled peptides are recalcitrant to Mdm2 mutations conferring Nutlin-resistance will aid in the further development of potent Mdm2 antagonists. Here, we report the 2.00 Å crystal structure of a stapled peptide antagonist bound to Nutlin resistant Mdm2. The stapled peptide relies on an extended network of interactions along the hydrophobic binding cleft of Mdm2 for high affinity binding. Additionally, as seen in other stapled peptide structures, the hydrocarbon staple itself contributes to binding through favourable interactions with Mdm2. The structure highlights the intrinsic plasticity present in both Mdm2 and the hydrocarbon staple moiety, and can be used to guide future iterations of both small molecules and stapled peptides for improved antagonists of Mdm2."
https://openalex.org/W2056329627,"Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is the vasopressin-regulated water channel that controls renal water reabsorption and urine concentration. AQP2 undergoes different regulated post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, which are fundamental for controlling AQP2 cellular localization, stability, and function. The relationship between AQP2 and S-glutathionylation is of potential interest because reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced under renal failure or nephrotoxic drugs, may influence renal function as well as the expression and the activity of different transporters and channels, including aquaporins. Here, we show for the first time that AQP2 is subjected to S-glutathionylation in kidney and in HEK-293 cells stably expressing AQP2. S-Glutathionylation is a redox-dependent post-translational modification controlling several signal transduction pathways and displaying an acute effect on free cytosolic calcium concentration. Interestingly, we found that in fresh kidney slices, the increased AQP2 S-glutathionylation correlated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced ROS generation. Moreover, we also found that cells expressing wild-type human calcium-sensing receptor (hCaSR-wt) and its gain of function (hCaSR-R990G; hCaSR-N124K) had a significant decrease in AQP2 S-glutathionylation secondary to reduced ROS levels and reduced basal intracellular calcium concentration compared with mock cells. Together, these new findings provide fundamental insight into cell biological aspects of AQP2 function and may be relevant to better understand and explain pathological states characterized by an oxidative stress and AQP2-dependent water reabsorption disturbs."
https://openalex.org/W2032590624,"Patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) often have increased angiotensin II (Ang II) levels and cachexia. Ang II infusion in rodents causes sustained skeletal muscle wasting and decreases muscle regenerative potential through Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-mediated signaling, likely contributing to the development of cachexia in CHF and CKD. However, the potential role of Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) signaling in skeletal muscle physiology is unknown. We found that AT2R expression was increased robustly in regenerating skeletal muscle after cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced muscle injury in vivo and differentiating myoblasts in vitro, suggesting that the increase in AT2R played an important role in regulating myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration. To determine the potential role of AT2R in muscle regeneration, we infused C57BL/6 mice with the AT2R antagonist PD123319 during CTX-induced muscle regeneration. PD123319 reduced the size of regenerating myofibers and expression of the myoblast differentiation markers myogenin and embryonic myosin heavy chain. On the other hand, AT2R agonist CGP42112 infusion potentiated CTX injury-induced myogenin and embryonic myosin heavy chain expression and increased the size of regenerating myofibers. In cultured myoblasts, AT2R knockdown by siRNA suppressed myoblast differentiation marker expression and myoblast differentiation via up-regulation of phospho-ERK1/2, and ERK inhibitor treatment completely blocked the effect of AT2R knockdown. These data indicate that AT2R signaling positively regulates myoblast differentiation and potentiates skeletal muscle regenerative potential, providing a new therapeutic target in wasting disorders such as CHF and CKD.

These mitotically quiescent mononuclear muscle stem cells are the key orchestrators of the regenerative response to injury. They become activated, proliferate, form myoblasts, and then terminally differentiate and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes, thereby repairing damaged myofibers (20.Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Day K. Cohen I.S. Gaudette G.R. Regenerating the Heart. Springer, 2011: 173-200Crossref Google Scholar).

Our findings indicate that AT2R expression is increased dramatically in satellite cells during differentiation and that the AT2R is a critical positive regulator of myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle regenerative processes. Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Tulane University. 8- to 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used in this study. Ang II (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, 1.5 µg/kg/min), PD123319 (Pfizer, 30 mg/kg/day), and CGP42112 (Sigma, 10 µg/kg/min) were administered via osmotic minipump (Alzet model 1007D). CTX was injected as previously described (25.Yan Z. Choi S. Liu X. Zhang M. Schageman J.J. Lee S.Y. Hart R. Lin L. Thurmond F.A. Williams R.S.

The ERK inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and used at final concentrations of 10 and 25 µm, respectively. Skeletal muscle slow and fast myosin were stained on paraffin (6 µm) sections using a Mouse on Mouse immunodetection kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Sections were costained with laminin to identify each myofiber. Satellite cells were collected as described previously (26.Conboy I.M. Conboy M.J. Smythe G.M. Rando T.A.

Briefly, hind limb muscles (gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior, and extensor digitorum longus) were incubated with 0.2% (w/v) collagenase type II in DMEM and 10% horse serum for 2 h at 37 °C. Digested muscles were dissociated by triturating with a Pasteur pipette, washed, and digested further with 1 unit/ml dispase for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were filtered, washed, and incubated in proliferation medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS (Mediatech), 10% HS (horse serum), 2% chicken embryo extract (US Biological), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin) for 40 min to let the fibroblasts attach onto the plate, and unattached cells were plated onto Matrigel-coated plates in the proliferation medium at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2. C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) were cultured in C2C12 growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm l-glutamine). After satellite cells and C2C12 cells reached confluence, cells were switched to differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm l-glutamine) to induce differentiation. The myoblast fusion index was calculated as the percentage of nuclei in eMyHC-positive myotubes divided by the total number of nuclei. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously (5.Yoshida T. Semprun-Prieto L. Sukhanov S. Delafontaine P. IGF-1 prevents ANG II-induced skeletal muscle atrophy via Akt- and Foxo-dependent inhibition of the ubiquitin ligase atrogin-1 expression.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2010; 298: H1565-H1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the PCR primers used in this study were obtained commercially (SABiosciences; PPM04482A for myogenin, PPM41610F for eMyHC, PPM04811A for AT2R, and PPM03559F for Hprt). Cells were plated on 96-well plates in proliferation medium, and cell proliferation, cell viability, and caspase 3/7 activity was measured when cells reached confluence (day 0) and 24 h after cells were switched to differentiation medium (differentiation day 1). For cell proliferation analysis, anti-Notch antibody (Millipore, 1:300) was added to the culture together with BrdU (10 µm) and incubated for 24 h. BrdU incorporation was measured using a BrdU cell proliferation ELISA kit (Roche) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cell viability and caspase 3/7 were measured using a CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) and Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega), respectively, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For the apoptosis and cell viability assay, staurosporine (1 mm, Cell Signaling Technology) and mitomycin C (0.4 mg/ml, Sigma), respectively, were added as positive controls. The siRNAs used in this study were obtained from Invitrogen (Silencer Select siRNA; AT2R siRNA-a, catalog no. s201014; AT2R siRNA-b, catalog no. s62151; and control siRNA, catalog no. 4390843). For in vivo siRNA electroporation, mice were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine, the hind limbs were shaved, and 35 µl of siRNA (20 µm) was injected into five to six different locations of the gastrocnemius muscle with a 22-gauge needle and syringe (Hamilton model 705). Transcutaneous pulses were applied by two stainless steel plate electrodes (Caliper Electrode model 384, BTX) with a distance between the two plates of 0.5 cm, and conductive gel was used to ensure the electrical contact. Electric pulses with a standard square wave were delivered by an electroporator (ECM830 Electro Square Porator, BTX). Eight pulses of 100 V/cm were administered to the muscle with a delivery rate of 1 pulse/s, with each pulse 20 ms in duration. In vitro siRNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cells were transfected when they reached ∼40% confluence, and the second transfection was performed on the following day to ensure a high efficiency of transfection. C2C12 myoblasts and primary satellite cells were induced to differentiate 2 days after the initial transfection. Consistent with previous reports (25.Yan Z. Choi S. Liu X. Zhang M. Schageman J.J. Lee S.Y. Hart R. Lin L. Thurmond F.A. Williams R.S. Highly coordinated gene regulation in mouse skeletal muscle regeneration.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8826-8836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), a number of myogenic transcription factors were up-regulated in the hind limb muscle after CTX injury. Myogenin mRNA expression reached a maximal level on day 3, which preceded maximal induction of eMyHC expression, a marker of differentiating myotubes. Although there was no detectable AT2R expression in skeletal muscle before the CTX injury, the AT2R mRNA level was increased robustly during regeneration and reached a maximal level on day 5, coinciding with the expression of eMyHC (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that AT2R expression is induced during the process of satellite cell differentiation. Consistent with these data, AT2R mRNA and protein expression was highly up-regulated in primary satellite cells and C2C12 myoblasts after cells were induced to differentiate (Fig. 1, B and C). These data strongly suggest that up-regulation of AT2R expression during satellite cell differentiation may play an important role in muscle regenerative processes. The robust increase of AT2R expression during muscle regeneration in vivo and during satellite cell/C2C12 myoblast differentiation in vitro (Fig. 1) suggested that the AT2R plays an important role in the regulation of satellite cell differentiation and muscle regeneration. To investigate the role of the AT2R during muscle regeneration in vivo, we infused mice with the AT2R antagonist PD123319 (28.Blankley C.J. Hodges J.C. Klutchko S.R. Himmelsbach R.J. Chucholowski A. Connolly C.J. Neergaard S.J. Van Nieuwenhze M.S. Sebastian A. Quin J. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of a novel series of non-peptide angiotensin II receptor binding inhibitors specific for the AT2 subtype.J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3248-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) in a setting of CTX-induced injury (Fig. 2A). We found that PD123319 infusion significantly reduced the size of regenerating myofibers, whereas the number of regenerating myofibers was not altered (Fig. 2, B and C). To gain more insight into the AT2R-mediated regulation of regenerating myofiber number and size, we analyzed the slow and fast fiber sizes in regenerating areas. As shown in Fig. 2B, the sizes of regenerating myofibers positive for slow and fast myosin were both reduced to the same extent, suggesting that the effect of AT2R suppression is not fiber type-specific. We also analyzed the number of regenerating myofibers on the basis of the number of centralized nuclei in each myofiber (Fig. 2E). There was a significant reduction in the number of regenerating myofibers with two or more centralized nuclei, suggesting that AT2R suppression prevents myoblast fusion. Furthermore, these alterations of skeletal muscle regeneration were associated with a decline in the expression of myogenin and eMyHC (Fig. 2, F and G). Next we infused the AT2R agonist CGP42112 into C57BL/6 mice after CTX injury to determine the effect of AT2R activation on muscle regeneration (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the effects of AT2R antagonism and AT2R knockdown (Fig. 2), the infusion of the AT2R agonist in the setting of CTX-induced injury increased the size of regenerating myofibers without altering the total number of regenerating myofibers (Fig. 3, B and C). The increase of regenerating myofiber size was not fiber type-specific (Fig. 3, D and E) as in the case of AT2R antagonist infusion. We also found that there was an increase in the number of centralized nuclei in regenerating myofibers. These changes in regenerating myofibers after AT2R agonist infusion were associated with increased expression of myogenin (Fig. 3D) and eMyHC (Fig. 3E). These data strongly suggest that AT2R activation positively regulates satellite cell differentiation and potentiates muscle regeneration.FIGURE 3The AT2R agonist potentiates skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo.

AT2R siRNA was delivered to mouse gastrocnemius muscle via electroporation-mediated siRNA transfer (29.Broderick K.E. Chan A. Lin F. Shen X. Kichaev G. Khan A.S. Aubin J. Zimmermann T.S.

AT2R siRNA markedly blunted the injury-induced increase in AT2R expression (Fig. 4B) and significantly suppressed the increase of myogenin and eMyHC (Fig. 4, C and D), consistent with our AT2R antagonist infusion experiment (Fig. 2). These data are consistent with our hypothesis that the AT2R regulates satellite cell differentiation and muscle regeneration. To obtain further insights, we transfected AT2R siRNA to C2C12 cells to analyze the effect of AT2R knockdown on myoblast differentiation. As shown in Fig. 5A, AT2R siRNA (we used two independent AT2R siRNA, see “Experimental Procedures” for detailed information) blocked the induction of AT2R expression that occurred during normal C2C12 myoblast differentiation. AT2R knockdown did not alter apoptosis, viability, or proliferation of C2C12 cells either before or after induction of differentiation (Fig. 5C). Importantly, AT2R knockdown markedly reduced the induction of myogenin and desmin, consistent with our in vivo observations (Fig. 5A). It has been shown that MAPK signaling plays an important role in C2C12 myoblast differentiation (30.Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Regulation of distinct stages of skeletal muscle differentiation by mitogen-activated protein kinases.Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2062114511,"Background Around ten percent of the population have been reported as having Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Few previous studies have ascertained the chronicity of CKD. In the UK, a payment for performance (P4P) initiative incentivizes CKD (stages 3–5) recognition and management in primary care, but the impact of this has not been assessed. Methods and Findings Using data from 426 primary care practices (population 2,707,130), the age standardised prevalence of stages 3–5 CKD was identified using two consecutive estimated Glomerular Filtration Rates (eGFRs) seven days apart. Additionally the accuracy of practice CKD registers and the relationship between accurate identification of CKD and the achievement of P4P indicators was determined. Between 2005 and 2009, the prevalence of stages 3–5 CKD increased from 0.3% to 3.9%. In 2009, 30,440 patients (1.1% unadjusted) fulfilled biochemical criteria for CKD but were not on a practice CKD register (uncoded CKD) and 60,705 patients (2.2% unadjusted) were included on a practice CKD register but did not fulfil biochemical criteria (miscoded CKD). For patients with confirmed CKD, inclusion in a practice register was associated with increasing age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and increasing CKD stage (p<0.0001). Uncoded CKD patients compared to miscoded patients were less likely to achieve performance indicators for blood pressure (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82–0.86 p<0.001) or recorded albumin-creatinine ratio (OR 0.73, 0.70–0.76, p<0.001). Conclusions The prevalence of stages 3–5 CKD, using two laboratory reported eGFRs, was lower than estimates from previous studies. Clinically significant discrepancies were identified between biochemically defined CKD and appearance on practice registers, with misclassification associated with sub-optimal care for some people with CKD."

We studied the prevalence and association with high-grade cervical lesions of different HPV16/18 variant lineages in a case-control study including 217 cases (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or grade 3 or worse: CIN2 or CIN3+) and 116 controls (no CIN2 or CIN3+ in two-year follow-up). HPV lineages were determined by sequencing the long control region (LCR) and the E6 gene. Phylogenetic analysis of HPV16 confirmed that isolates clustered into previously described lineages: A (260, 87.5%), B (4, 1.3%), C (8, 2.7%), and D (25, 8.4%). Lineage D/lineage A strains were, respectively, detected in 4/82 control patients, 19/126 CIN3+ cases (OR = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.0–12.9, p = 0.04), 6/1 glandular high-grade lesions (OR = 123, 95%CI: 9.7–5713.6, p<0.0001), and 4/5 invasive lesions (OR = 16.4, 95%CI: 2.2–113.7, p = 0.002). HPV18 clustered in lineages A (32, 88.9%) and B (4, 11.1%). Lineage B/lineage A strains were respectively detected in 1/23 control patients and 2/5 CIN3+ cases (OR = 9.2, 95%CI: 0.4–565.4, p = 0.12). In conclusion, lineages A of HPV16/18 were predominant in Spain. Lineage D of HPV16 was associated with increased risk for CIN3+, glandular high-grade lesions, and invasive lesions compared with lineage A. Lineage B of HPV18 may be associated with increased risk for CIN3+ compared with lineage A, but the association was not significant. Large well-designed studies are needed before the application of HPV lineage detection in clinical settings."

Full-length OPN (OPN-FL), thrombin-cleaved N-terminal fragment (OPN-R), thrombin- and carboxypeptidase B2-double-cleaved N-terminal fragment (OPN-L), and C-terminal fragment (OPN-CTF) did not have intrinsic chemotactic activity, but all potentiated CCL21-induced DC migration. OPN-FL possessed the highest potency, whereas OPNRAA-FL had substantially less activity, indicating the importance of RGD. We identified a conserved 168RSKSKKFRR176 sequence on OPN-FL that spans the thrombin cleavage site, and it demonstrated potent pro-chemotactic effects on CCL21-induced DC migration. OPN-FLR168A had reduced activity, and the double mutant OPNRAA-FLR168A had even lower activity, indicating that these functional domains accounted for most of the pro-chemotactic activity of OPN-FL. OPN-CTF also possessed substantial pro-chemotactic activity, which was fully expressed upon thrombin cleavage and its release from the intact protein, because OPN-CTF was substantially more active than OPNRAA-FLR168A containing the OPN-CTF sequence within the intact protein. OPN-R and OPN-L possessed similar potency, indicating that the newly exposed C-terminal SVVYGLR sequence in OPN-R was not involved in the pro-chemotactic effect. OPN-FL and OPN-CTF did not directly bind to the CD44 standard form or CD44v6. In conclusion, thrombin cleavage of OPN disrupts a pro-chemotactic sequence in intact OPN, and its loss of pro-chemotactic activity is compensated by the release of OPN-CTF, which assumes a new conformation and possesses substantial activity in enhancing chemokine-induced migration of DCs.

https://openalex.org/W2051337453,"Background Acute decompression illness (DCI) involving the brain (Cerebral DCI) is one of the most serious forms of diving-related injuries which may leave residual brain damage. Cerebral DCI occurs in compressed air and in breath-hold divers, likewise. We conducted this study to investigate whether long-term breath-hold divers who may be exposed to repeated symptomatic and asymptomatic brain injuries, show brain damage on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subjects and Methods Our study subjects were 12 commercial breath-hold divers (Ama) with long histories of diving work in a district of Japan. We obtained information on their diving practices and the presence or absence of medical problems, especially DCI events. All participants were examined with MRI to determine the prevalence of brain lesions. Results Out of 12 Ama divers (mean age: 54.9±5.1 years), four had histories of cerebral DCI events, and 11 divers demonstrated ischemic lesions of the brain on MRI studies. The lesions were situated in the cortical and/or subcortical area (9 cases), white matters (4 cases), the basal ganglia (4 cases), and the thalamus (1 case). Subdural fluid collections were seen in 2 cases. Conclusion These results suggest that commercial breath-hold divers are at a risk of clinical or subclinical brain injury which may affect the long-term neuropsychological health of divers."
https://openalex.org/W1986853657,"Premature newborns are frequently exposed to hyperoxic conditions and experimental data indicate modulation of liver metabolism by hyperoxia in the first postnatal period. Conversely, nothing is known about possible modulation of growth factors and signaling molecules involved in other hyperoxic responses and no data are available about the effects of hyperoxia in postnatal liver haematopoiesis. The aim of the study was to analyse the effects of hyperoxia in the liver tissue (hepatocytes and haemopoietic cells) and to investigate possible changes in the expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α), endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS), and Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-kB). Experimental design of the study involved exposure of newborn rats to room air (controls), 60% O2 (moderate hyperoxia), or 95% O2 (severe hyperoxia) for the first two postnatal weeks. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses were performed. Severe hyperoxia increased hepatocyte apoptosis and MMP-9 expression and decreased VEGF expression. Reduced content in reticular fibers was found in moderate and severe hyperoxia. Some other changes were specifically produced in hepatocytes by moderate hyperoxia, i.e., upregulation of HIF-1α and downregulation of eNOS and NF-kB. Postnatal severe hyperoxia exposure increased liver haemopoiesis and upregulated the expression of VEGF (both moderate and severe hyperoxia) and eNOS (severe hyperoxia) in haemopoietic cells. In conclusion, our study showed different effects of hyperoxia on hepatocytes and haemopoietic cells and differential involvement of the above factors. The involvement of VEGF and eNOS in the liver haemopoietic response to hyperoxia may be hypothesized."

Airway macrophages are important innate immune cells with roles in both the induction and resolution of tissue inflammation.To investigate airway innate immune cellular phenotypes in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or CLD.Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was obtained from term and preterm infants requiring mechanical ventilation. BAL cells were phenotyped by flow cytometry.Preterm birth was associated with an increase in the proportion of non-classical CD14(+)/CD16(+) monocytes on the day of delivery (58.9 ± 5.8% of total mononuclear cells in preterm vs 33.0 ± 6.1% in term infants, p = 0.02). Infants with RDS were born with significantly more CD36(+) macrophages compared with the CLD group (70.3 ± 5.3% in RDS vs 37.6 ± 8.9% in control, p = 0.02). At day 3, infants born at a low gestational age are more likely to have greater numbers of CD14(+) mononuclear phagocytes in the airway (p = 0.03), but fewer of these cells are functionally polarized as assessed by HLA-DR (p = 0.05) or CD36 (p = 0.05) positivity, suggesting increased recruitment of monocytes or a failure to mature these cells in the lung.These findings suggest that macrophage polarization may be affected by gestational maturity, that more immature macrophage phenotypes may be associated with the progression of RDS to CLD and that phenotyping mononuclear cells in BAL could predict disease outcome."

In these studies CD4+CD25+ Treg were depleted using monoclonal antibodies against CD25, which might also interfere with CD25 on non-regulatory T cell populations and would have no effect on Foxp3+CD25− Treg. To obtain more insights in the specific function of Treg during vaccination we used mice that are transgenic for a bacterial artificial chromosome expressing a diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor-eGFP fusion protein under the control of the foxp3 gene locus (depletion of regulatory T cell mice; DEREG). As an experimental vaccine-carrier recombinant Bordetella adenylate cyclase toxoid fused with a MHC-class I-restricted epitope of the circumsporozoite protein (ACT-CSP) of Plasmodium berghei (Pb) was used. ACT-CSP was shown by us previously to introduce the CD8+ epitope of Pb-CSP into the MHC class I presentation pathway of professional antigen-presenting cells (APC). Using this system we demonstrate here that the number of CSP-specific T cells increases when Treg are depleted during prime but also during boost immunization. Importantly, despite this increase of T effector cells no difference in the number of antigen-specific memory cells was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2059785926,"The phosphatidylinositol 3–kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is critical in modulating platelet functions. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of S14161, a recently identified pan-class I PI3K inhibitor, on platelet activation and thrombus formation. Results showed that S14161 inhibited human platelet aggregation induced by collagen, thrombin, U46619, and ADP in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric studies showed that S14161 inhibited convulxin- or thrombin-induced P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding of single platelet. S14161 also inhibited platelet spreading on fibrinogen and clot retraction, processes mediated by outside-in signaling. Using a microfluidic chamber we demonstrated that S14161 decreased platelet adhesion on collagen-coated surface by about 80%. Western blot showed that S14161 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 sites, and GSK3β at Ser9 in response to collagen, thrombin, or U46619. Comparable studies showed that S14161 has a higher potential bioavailability than LY294002, a prototypical inhibitor of pan-class I PI3K. Finally, the effects of S14161 on thrombus formation in vivo were measured using a ferric chloride-induced carotid artery injury model in mice. The intraperitoneal injection of S14161 (2 mg/kg) to male C57BL/6 mice significantly extended the first occlusion time (5.05±0.99 min, n = 9) compared to the vehicle controls (3.72±0.95 min, n = 8) (P<0.05), but did not prolong the bleeding time (P>0.05). Taken together, our data showed that S14161 inhibits platelet activation and thrombus formation without significant bleeding tendency and toxicity, and considering its potential higher bioavailability, it may be developed as a novel therapeutic agent for the prevention of thrombotic disorders."

Methods Data of this study came from investigation of 199 completed suicide cases and their paired controls of rural areas in three different counties in Shandong, China, by interviewing one informant of each subject using the method of Psychological Autopsy (PA). Results There were 78 (39.2%) suicides with violent methods and 121 (60.8%) suicides with non-violent methods. Ingesting pesticides, as a non-violent method, appeared to be the most common suicide method (103, 51.8%). Hanging (73 cases, 36.7%) and drowning (5 cases, 2.5%) were the only violent methods observed. Storage of pesticides at home and higher suicide intent score were significantly associated with choice of violent methods while committing suicide. Risk factors related to suicide death included negative life events and hopelessness. Conclusions Suicide with violent methods has different factors from suicide with non-violent methods. Suicide methods should be considered in suicide prevention and intervention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2154351849,"Transient receptor potential melastatin-1 (TRPM1) is essential for the light-induced depolarization of retinal ON bipolar cells. TRPM1 likely forms a multimeric channel complex, although almost nothing is known about the structure or subunit composition of channels formed by TRPM1 or any of its close relatives. Recombinant TRPM1 was robustly expressed in insect cells, but only a small fraction was localized to the plasma membrane. Similar intracellular localization was observed when TRPM1 was heterologously expressed in mammalian cells. TRPM1 was affinity-purified from Sf9 cells and complexed with amphipol, followed by detergent removal. In blue native gels and size exclusion chromatography, TRPM1 migrated with a mobility consistent with detergent- or amphipol-bound dimers. Cross-linking experiments were also consistent with a dimeric subunit stoichiometry, and cryoelectron microscopy and single particle analysis without symmetry imposition yielded a model with approximate 2-fold symmetrical features. Finally, electron microscopy of TRPM1-antibody complexes revealed a large particle that can accommodate TRPM1 and two antibody molecules. Taken together, these data indicate that purified TRPM1 is mostly dimeric. The three-dimensional structure of TRPM1 dimers is characterized by a small putative transmembrane domain and a larger domain with a hollow cavity. Blue native gels of solubilized mouse retina indicate that TRPM1 is present in two distinct complexes: one similar in size to the recombinant protein and one much larger. Because dimers are likely not functional ion channels, these results suggest that additional partner subunits participate in forming the transduction channel required for dim light vision and the ON pathway."

In Bacillus subtilis, the model system for spore formers, the recently discovered crust and the proteinaceous coat are the external layers that surround the spore and contribute to its survival. The coat is formed by about seventy different proteins assembled and organized into three layers by the action of a subset of regulatory proteins, referred to as morphogenetic factors. CotH is a morphogenetic factor needed for the development of spores able to germinate efficiently and involved in the assembly of nine outer coat proteins, including CotG. Here we report that CotG has negative effects on spore germination and on the assembly of at least three outer coat proteins. Such negative action is exerted only in mutants lacking CotH, thus suggesting an antagonistic effect of the two proteins, with CotH counteracting the negative role of CotG."

https://openalex.org/W2069713133,"The highly infectious bacteria, Francisella tularensis, colonize a variety of organs and replicate within both phagocytic as well as non-phagocytic cells, to cause the disease tularemia. These microbes contain a conserved cluster of important virulence genes referred to as the Francisella Pathogenicity Island (FPI). Two of the most characterized FPI genes, iglC and pdpA, play a central role in bacterial survival and proliferation within phagocytes, but do not influence bacterial internalization. Yet, their involvement in non-phagocytic epithelial cell infections remains unexplored. To examine the functions of IglC and PdpA on bacterial invasion and replication during epithelial cell infections, we infected liver and lung epithelial cells with F. novicida and F. tularensis 'Type B' Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) deletion mutants (ΔiglC and ΔpdpA) as well as their respective gene complements. We found that deletion of either gene significantly reduced their ability to invade and replicate in epithelial cells. Gene complementation of iglC and pdpA partially rescued bacterial invasion and intracellular growth. Additionally, substantial LAMP1-association with both deletion mutants was observed up to 12 h suggesting that the absence of IglC and PdpA caused deficiencies in their ability to dissociate from LAMP1-positive Francisella Containing Vacuoles (FCVs). This work provides the first evidence that IglC and PdpA are important pathogenic factors for invasion and intracellular growth of Francisella in epithelial cells, and further highlights the discrete mechanisms involved in Francisella infections between phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells."

Still, a cause-effect relationship and the underlying mediators remain unclear, particularly for low-incidence populations. We aimed to prospectively determine whether adiposity factors could predict the development of UCC and OVC in Taiwanese women. To explore the biological mediators linking adiposity factors to cancer risk, we examined the association of two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, with the gynecological cancers. Methods Totally, 11,258 women, aged 30–65, were recruited into the Community-Based Cancer Screening Program (CBCSP) study during 1991–1993, and were followed for UCC and OVC cases until December 31, 2011. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Adiposity factors and risk covariates were assessed at recruitment. Newly-developed cancer cases were determined from data in the government’s National Cancer Registry and Death Certification System. For adipokienes study, a nested case-control study was conducted within the cohort. Baseline plasma samples of 40 incident gynecological cancer cases and 240 age-menopause-matched controls were assayed for adipokines levels. Findings There were 38 and 30 incident cases of UCC and OVC, respectively, diagnosed during a median 19.9 years of follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed that alcohol intake (HR = 16.00, 95% = 4.83–53.00), high triglyceride levels (HR = 2.58, 95% = 1.28–5.17), and years of endogenous estrogen exposure per 5-year increment (HR = 1.91, 95% = 1.08–3.38) were associated with increased UCC risk. High body mass index (BMI≥27 kg/m2, HR = 2.90, 95% = 1.30–6.46) was associated with increased OVC risk. Analysis further showed an independent effect of adipokines on UCC and OVC risk after adjustment of the risk covariates. Conclusion We provided evidence that alcohol intake, high triglyceride levels and long endogenous estrogen exposure increase UCC risk, whereas obesity positively predicts OVC risk. Circulating adipokines may mediate the link of adiposity factors to gynecological cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2034813612,"The inappropriate activation of complement may contribute to various immune diseases. The alternative pathway (AP) predominates during complement activation regardless of the initiating pathways. Hence, the main AP regulator factor H (FH) holds great potential as an attractive therapeutic intervention. In addition, complement receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily (CRIg) has been demonstrated to inhibit AP and, more notably, still specifically binds to C3b/iC3b. We thus developed novel CRIg-targeted complement inhibitors by connecting the functional domains of CRIg and FH, which we termed CRIg-FH and CRIg-L-FH. CRIg-L-FH, slightly more potent than CRIg-FH, considerably inhibited both AP- and also classical pathway (CP)-mediated hemolysis and successfully eliminated the deposition of C3b/iC3b. Kinetic analysis further revealed that the binding affinity constant (KD) of CRIg/FH was in the micromolar range, consistent with its long-lasting binding to complement-attacked cells. CRIg-L-FH efficiently protected aberrant erythrocytes of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) from AP-and CP-mediated complement damage (IC50 was 22.43 and 64.69 nM, respectively). Moreover, CRIg-L-FH was found to inhibit complement activation induced by the anti-Thy1 antibody in a mesangiopro-liferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) rat model. Hence, CRIg-L-FH protects glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) from complement-mediated injury and proliferative lesions. These findings strongly suggest that CRIg/FH is a potential therapeutic drug candidate for a range of complement-mediated diseases.—Qiao, Q., Teng, X., Wang, N., Lu, R., Guo, L., Zhang, X., Du, Y., Wang, W., Chen, S., Wu, Q., He, G., Wang, Y., and Hu, W., A novel CRIg-targeted complement inhibitor protects cells from complement damage.

Here, we extensively evaluate parameters related to CVD and oxidative stress (OS) in SHROB rats. SHROB rats were monitored for 15 weeks and compared to a control group of Wistar rats. Body weight was recorded weekly. At the end of the study, parameters related to CVD and OS were evaluated in plasma, urine and different organs. SHROB rats presented statistically significant differences from Wistar rats in CVD risk factors: total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, apoA1, apoB100, abdominal fat, insulin, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, ICAM-1 and PAI-1. In adipose tissue, liver and brain, the endogenous antioxidant systems were activated, yet there was no significant oxidative damage to lipids (MDA) or proteins (carbonylation). We conclude that SHROB rats present significant alterations in parameters related to inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, thrombotic activity, insulin resistance and OS measured in plasma as well as enhanced redox defence systems in vital organs that will be useful as markers of MetS and CVD for nutrition interventions."

We compared the expression of several antioxidant enzymes in these two cell lines and found that peroxiredoxin 1/2/6 and catalase are expressed at high levels in K562 cells. We further investigated the possible role of peroxirdoxin 1/2/6 and catalase in determining the cellular sensitivity to As2O3. Interestingly, knockdown of peroxiredoxin 1/2/6 did not increase the susceptibility of K562 cells to As2O3. On the contrary, knockdown of catalase markedly enhanced As2O3-induced apoptosis. In addition, we provide evidence that overexpression of BCR/ABL cannot increase the expression of PRDX 1/2/6 and catalase. The current study reveals that the functional role of antioxidant enzymes is cellular context and treatment agents dependent; targeting catalase may represent a novel strategy to improve the efficacy of As2O3 in CML treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2032909115,"NF-κB is a transcription factor involved in many signaling pathways that also plays an important role in UV-induced skin tumorigenesis. UV radiation can activate NF-κB, but the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we provided evidence that the activation of constitutive nitric-oxide synthase plays a role in regulation of IκB reduction and NF-κB activation in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells in early phase (within 6 h) post-UVB. Treating the cells with l-NAME, a selective inhibitor of constitutive nitric-oxide synthase (cNOS), can partially reverse the IκB reduction and inhibit the DNA binding activity as well as nuclear translocation of NF-κB after UVB radiation. A luciferase reporter assay indicates that UVB-induced NF-κB activation is totally diminished in cNOS null cells. The cNOS-mediated reduction of IκB is likely due to the imbalance of nitric oxide/peroxynitrite because treating the cells with lower (50 μm), but not higher (100-500 μm), concentration of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) can reverse the effect of l-NAME in partial restore IκB level post-UVB. Our data also showed that NF-κB activity was required for maintaining a stable IκB kinase α subunit (IKKα) level because treating the cells with NF-κB or cNOS inhibitors could reduce IKKα level upon UVB radiation. In addition, our data demonstrated that although NF-κB protects cells from UVB-induced death, its pro-survival activity was likely neutralized by the pro-death activity of peroxynitrite after UVB radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2043753388,"Saliva is considered as the best source of biological material for biomarker discovery studies since it is noninvasive in comparison to other body sources. Usually buffalo cannot precisely express estrus signals. Hence, there is a need for concise methods to detect the time of estrus to ensure the success of artificial insemination. Therefore, we have established a reference proteome map on the whole saliva of buffalo during their estrous cycle with special reference to estrus. Nearly 12 bands have been observed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole saliva. Collectively, 179 proteins are identified with respect to different phases of the estrous cycle using mass spectrometry. On the whole, 37 proteins are exclusively expressed in the estrus phase, which include β-enolase, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, clusterin, lactoperoxidase, serotransferrin, TGM3, UBA6, and transducin. Among the proteins, β-enolase and TLR 4 were validated, and their specific expression was found during estrus as compared to other phases using immunoblot. The functional annotation reveals many as binding proteins in the estrus saliva when compared to the other phases. The present findings conclude that the proteomic approach adopted to identify the proteins from buffalo saliva around the estrous cycle may provide a new tool for screening the estrus phase. The results further conclude that the specific expression of β-enolase and TLR 4 can be taken as the indicator of estrus in buffalo."

Current models suggest that a drug binds relatively tightly to a transport site in the transmembrane domains when the protein is in the closed inward facing conformation. Upon binding of ATP, the transporter can switch to an outward facing (drug off or drug releasing) structure of lower affinity. ATP hydrolysis is critically important for remodeling the drug-binding site to facilitate drug release and to reset the transporter for a new transport cycle. We characterized the novel phenotype of an S1368A mutant that lies in the putative drug-binding pocket of the yeast multidrug transporter Pdr5. This substitution created broad, severe drug hypersensitivity, although drug binding, ATP hydrolysis, and intradomain signaling were indistinguishable from the wild-type control. Several different rhodamine 6G efflux and accumulation assays yielded evidence consistent with the possibility that Ser-1368 prevents reentry of the excluded drug.

However, current protocols for differentiating hPSCs into neural lineages remain inefficient and largely variable between different hPSC lines. We report that microRNA 376c (miR-376c) significantly enhanced neural differentiation of hPSCs in a defined condition by suppressing SMAD4, the co-SMAD for TGF-β signaling. Downstream, SMAD4 directly bound and suppressed PAX6, the critical neural lineage specification factor. Interestingly, we also found that SMAD4 binds and suppresses miR-376c clusters in undifferentiated hESCs. In summary, our findings revealed a reciprocal antagonism between miR-376c and SMAD signaling that regulates cell fate during human neural differentiation.—Liu, J., Wang, L., Su, Z., Wu, W., Cai, X., Li, D., Hou, J., Pei, D., Pan, G.

https://openalex.org/W2102022543,"Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate blood and lymphatic vessel development and homeostasis. VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) is the major receptor involved in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and regulates endothelial cell survival, migration, and mitogenesis. Ligand-mediated receptor dimerization instigates transmembrane signaling, thereby promoting activation of the intracellular kinase domain. The intracellular part of the receptor comprises the juxtamembrane domain, the catalytic kinase domain, the kinase insert domain (KID), and the carboxy terminal domain (CD). Here we show that the CD inhibits VEGFR-2 activity in the absence of ligand, whereas the KID, particularly a tyrosine residue in this domain (Y951), is indispensable for downstream signaling by the activated kinase. Because of the lack of crystallographic data for the complete kinase domain, we applied size-exclusion chromatography, multiangle laser scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and small-angle X-ray scattering to build and functionally validate structural models. Our data show substantial conformational changes of the kinase when it is switched from the inactive, unphosphorylated state to the active, phosphorylated state. Finally, we structurally characterized recombinantly produced protein complexes between VEGFR-2 and T cell-specific adapter protein, a molecule involved in downstream signaling by VEGFR-2."
https://openalex.org/W1973798391,"Numerous abnormalities of the peripheral blood T cell compartment have been reported in human chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection and related to prolonged antigenic stimulation by persisting parasites. Herein, we measured circulating lymphocytes of various phenotypes based on the differential expression of CD19, CD4, CD27, CD10, IgD, IgM, IgG and CD138 in a total of 48 T. cruzi-infected individuals and 24 healthy controls. Infected individuals had decreased frequencies of CD19+CD27+ cells, which positively correlated with the frequencies of CD4+CD27+ cells. The contraction of CD19+CD27+ cells was comprised of IgG+IgD-, IgM+IgD- and isotype switched IgM-IgD- memory B cells, CD19+CD10+CD27+ B cell precursors and terminally differentiated CD19+CD27+CD138+ plasma cells. Conversely, infected individuals had increased proportions of CD19+IgG+CD27-IgD- memory and CD19+IgM+CD27-IgD+ transitional/naïve B cells. These observations prompted us to assess soluble CD27, a molecule generated by the cleavage of membrane-bound CD27 and used to monitor systemic immune activation. Elevated levels of serum soluble CD27 were observed in infected individuals with Chagas cardiomyopathy, indicating its potentiality as an immunological marker for disease progression in endemic areas. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that chronic T. cruzi infection alters the distribution of various peripheral blood B cell subsets, probably related to the CD4+ T cell deregulation process provoked by the parasite in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2087136636,"RPE65 is the retinoid isomerohydrolase that converts all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol, a key reaction in the retinoid visual cycle. We have previously reported that cone-dominant chicken RPE65 (cRPE65) shares 90% sequence identity with human RPE65 (hRPE65) but exhibits substantially higher isomerohydrolase activity than that of bovine RPE65 or hRPE65. In this study, we sought to identify key residues responsible for the higher enzymatic activity of cRPE65. Based on the amino acid sequence comparison of mammalian and other lower vertebrates' RPE65, including cone-dominant chicken, 8 residues of hRPE65 were separately replaced by their counterparts of cRPE65 using site-directed mutagenesis. The enzymatic activities of cRPE65, hRPE65, and its mutants were measured by in vitro isomerohydrolase activity assay, and the retinoid products were analyzed by HPLC. Among the mutants analyzed, two single point mutants, N170K and K297G, and a double mutant, N170K/K297G, of hRPE65 exhibited significantly higher catalytic activity than WT hRPE65. Further, when an amino-terminal fragment (Met1–Arg33) of the N170K/K297G double mutant of hRPE65 was replaced with the corresponding cRPE65 fragment, the isomerohydrolase activity was further increased to a level similar to that of cRPE65. This finding contributes to the understanding of the structural basis for isomerohydrolase activity.

However, no present attempts for RPE65 gene therapy have successfully generated full vision recovery despite successful gene delivery. This may be due to low enzymatic activity of hRPE65, meaning that enhancement of hRPE65 enzymatic activity should be considered as an alternative approach. We have previously reported that RPE65 in cone-dominant chicken has a substantially higher isomerohydrolase activity compared with that in rod-dominant mammals (44.Moiseyev G. Takahashi Y. Chen Y. Kim S. Ma J.X. RPE65 from cone-dominant chicken is a more efficient isomerohydrolase compared with that from rod-dominant species.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8110-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have cloned chicken RPE65 (cRPE65) and expressed it in the same heterologous system as that for hRPE65. Recombinant cRPE65 showed significantly higher specific isomerohydrolase activity than that of hRPE65 when the activities were normalized by RPE65 protein levels (44.Moiseyev G. Takahashi Y. Chen Y. Kim S. Ma J.X. RPE65 from cone-dominant chicken is a more efficient isomerohydrolase compared with that from rod-dominant species.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8110-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that RPE65 from cone-dominant chicken is a more efficient isomerohydrolase, in comparison with mammalian RPE65, probably to meet the higher demand for 11-cis-retinal regeneration in the cone-dominant retina. Chicken and human RPE65 proteins share 90% sequence identity (50 different amino acid residues) at the amino acid level (44.Moiseyev G. Takahashi Y. Chen Y. Kim S. Ma J.X. RPE65 from cone-dominant chicken is a more efficient isomerohydrolase compared with that from rod-dominant species.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8110-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that some of the divergent amino acid residues in cRPE65 were responsible for its higher isomerohydrolase activity. In this study, we substituted the potential key residues in hRPE65 with their counterparts of cRPE65 and evaluated the isomerohydrolase activities of the generated hRPE65 mutants. In order to predict the key residues responsible for the higher enzymatic activity and/or protein levels of RPE65 in cone-dominant species, RPE65 amino acid sequences from chicken (accession number NP_990215), zebrafinch (Taeniopygia guttata, XP_002187720), and American chameleon (Anolis carolinensis, XP_003225885) were aligned with other known RPE65 sequences: human (accession number NP_000320), bovine (NP_776878), dog (NP_001003176), rat (NP_446014), mouse (NP_084263), newt (Q8AXN9), salamander (Q9YI25), and clawed frog (NP_001080269). WT hRPE65 and cRPE65 cDNAs were subcloned into cloning vectors as described previously (1.Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X.

The candidate key residues in hRPE65 were replaced by their counterparts in cRPE65 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's protocol. The introduced mutations were confirmed by sequencing from both strands using an ABI-3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and subcloned into an expression vector, pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). Following the sequence confirmation, the expression constructs were purified by a QIAfilter Maxi Prep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Further, the hRPE65 and cRPE65 cDNA were individually subcloned into pUC18. To generate six restriction fragments of hRPE65 and cRPE65, unique restriction enzyme sites were introduced without changing the amino acid sequence (see Fig. 5A). Each fragment of hRPE65 was replaced by its counterpart of cRPE65 using the introduced restriction enzyme sites.

Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. Identification of conserved histidines and glutamic acid as key residues for isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65, an enzyme of the visual cycle in the retinal pigment epithelium.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5414-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) or polyethyleneimine (PEI; Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA)) (1 mg/ml, pH 7.4, 2:1 PEI/DNA ratio), and the culture media were replaced at 6 h following the transfection. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested by a cell scraper and rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS. Protein levels and enzymatic activities of WT hRPE65 and its mutants were confirmed by Western blot analyses and an in vitro isomerohydrolase activity assay. Total cellular protein concentrations were measured using a Bradford assay (46.Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total cellular proteins (20 µg) of 293A-LRAT cells expressing WT hRPE65 and cRPE65 and of hRPE65 mutants and bovine RPE microsomal proteins (2.5 µg) as a positive control were resolved by electrophoresis through 8% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto an Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) unless specified. The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:1,000 dilution of an anti-RPE65 polyclonal antibody (27.Ma J.X. Zhang J. Othersen K.L. Moiseyev G. Ablonczy Z. Redmond T.M. Chen Y. Crouch R.K. Expression, purification, and MALDI analysis of RPE65.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1429-1435PubMed Google Scholar) to identify the key residues and a 1:50,000 dilution of an anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). We used another RPE65 antibody (44.Moiseyev G. Takahashi Y. Chen Y. Kim S. Ma J.X. RPE65 from cone-dominant chicken is a more efficient isomerohydrolase compared with that from rod-dominant species.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8110-8117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) to compare the expression levels of cRPE65 and chimeric mutants of RPE65 to avoid the immunoreactivity difference on fragment 3. After four washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated in a light-shielding container for 1.5 h with a 1:25,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with DyLight-549 and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with DyLight-649 (Pierce), and the bands were detected using the FluorChem Q imaging system (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA). The signal intensities were semiquantified by densitometry using AlphaView SA software (ProteinSimple) and averaged from at least three independent experiments. 293A-LRAT cells were separately transfected with plasmids expressing WT human and chicken RPE65 and hRPE65 mutants. 293A-LRAT cells expressing red fluorescence protein (RFP) were used as a negative control. Cells were lysed by sonication in a reaction buffer (10 mm 1,3-bis(tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino) propane, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl). All-trans-[11,12-3H]retinol (1 mCi/ml, 45.5 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO) in N,N-dimethyl formamide was used as the substrate for the isomerohydrolase assay. For each reaction, total cellular proteins (125 µg) were added into 200 µl of reaction buffer (10 mm 1,3-bis(tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino) propane, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.2 µm all-trans-retinol, 1% BSA, and 25 µm cellular retinal aldehyde-binding protein (47.Crabb J.W. Chen Y. Goldflam S. West K. Kapron J. Methods for producing recombinant human cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein.Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 89: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped, and retinoids were extracted with 300 µl of cold methanol and 300 µl of hexane. The generated retinoids were analyzed by normal phase HPLC as described previously (1.Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase in the retinoid visual cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The peak of each retinoid isomer was identified based on its characteristic retention time and absorption spectrum of retinoid standards. Isomerohydrolase activity was calculated from the area of the 11cROL peak using Radiomatic 610TR software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with synthetic 11-cis-[3H]retinol as the standard. To minimize the variation of the transfection efficiency, all in vitro activity assays of the mutants were conducted side-by-side with WT hRPE65, and the catalytic activities were expressed as values relative to that of WT hRPE65 unless specified. Plasmids expressing RFP (negative control), hRPE65, and cRPE65 were separately transfected into the 293A-LRAT cells and cultured for 48 h. The expression levels and enzymatic activities of hRPE65 and cRPE65 were verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A) and an in vitro isomerohydrolase assay. Both hRPE65 and cRPE65, but not negative control protein, RFP, converted all-trans-retinyl ester into 11cROL, the product of isomerohydrolase (Fig. 2, B–D). cRPE65 produced substant"
https://openalex.org/W1999872768,"Moderate hypoxic preconditioning of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) enhances properties such as proliferation and secretion of growth factors, representing a valuable strategy to increase the efficiency of cell-based therapies. In a wide variety of cells potassium (K+) channels are key elements involved in the cellular responses to hypoxia, suggesting that ASCs cultured under low oxygen conditions may display altered electrophysiological properties. Here, the effects of moderate hypoxic culture on proliferation, whole-cell currents, and ion channel expression were investigated using human ASCs cultured at 5% and 20% oxygen. Although cell proliferation was greatly enhanced, the dose-dependent growth inhibition by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) was not significantly affected by hypoxia. Under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, ASCs displayed outward K+ currents composed by Ca2+-activated, delayed rectifier, and transient components. Hypoxic culture reduced the slope of the current-voltage curves and caused a negative shift in the voltage activation threshold of the whole-cell currents. However, the TEA-mediated shift of voltage activation threshold was not affected by hypoxia. Semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that expression of genes encoding for various ion channels subunits related to oxygen sensing and proliferation remained unchanged after hypoxic culture. In conclusion, outward currents are influenced by moderate hypoxia in ASCs through a mechanism that is not likely the result of modulation of TEA-sensitive K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2054968858,"Protein kinase A (PKA) is ubiquitously expressed and is responsible for regulating many important cellular functions in response to changes in intracellular cAMP concentrations. The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer (R2:C2), with a regulatory subunit homodimer (R2) that binds and inhibits two catalytic (C) subunits; binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit homodimer causes activation of the catalytic subunits. Four different R subunit isoforms exist in mammalian cells, and these confer different structural features, subcellular localization, and biochemical properties upon the PKA holoenzymes they form. The holoenzyme containing RIIβ is structurally unique in that the type IIβ holoenzyme is much more compact than the free RIIβ homodimer. We have used small angle x-ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering to study the solution structure and subunit organization of a holoenzyme containing an RIIβ C-terminal deletion mutant (RIIβ(1-280)), which is missing the C-terminal cAMP-binding domain to better understand the structural organization of the type IIβ holoenzyme and the RIIβ domains that contribute to stabilizing the holoenzyme conformation. Our results demonstrate that compaction of the type IIβ holoenzyme does not require the C-terminal cAMP-binding domain but rather involves large structural rearrangements within the linker and N-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of the RIIβ homodimer. The structural rearrangements are significantly greater than seen previously with RIIα and are likely to be important in mediating short range and long range interdomain and intersubunit interactions that uniquely regulate the activity of the type IIβ isoform of PKA."
https://openalex.org/W2034116842,"DNA topoisomerases are thought to play a critical role in transcription, replication and recombination as well as in the condensation and segregation of sister duplexes during cell division. Here, we used high-resolution two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis to study the replication intermediates and final products of small circular and linear minichromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence and absence of DNA topoisomerase 2. The results obtained confirmed that whereas for circular minichromosomes, catenated sister duplexes accumulated in the absence of topoisomerase 2, linear YACs were able to replicate and segregate regardless of this topoisomerase. The patterns of replication intermediates for circular and linear YACs displayed significant differences suggesting that DNA supercoiling might play a key role in the modulation of replication fork progression. Altogether, this data supports the notion that for linear chromosomes the torsional tension generated by transcription and replication dissipates freely throughout the telomeres."
