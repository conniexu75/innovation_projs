Fractions were assayed for both Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Mn-SOD by exploiting the cyanide sensitivity of the former activity and by the use of specific antibodies. As expected, the cytosol and lysosomal fractions contained Cu,Zn-SOD; while the mitochondrial matrix contained Mn-SOD. In mitochondria, Cu,Zn-SOD was found in the intermembrane space and Mn-SOD in the matrix and also on the inner membrane. The Mn-SOD associated with the inner membrane was solubilized by 0.5 m NaCl. Surprisingly the intracellular membrane fraction (microsomes) contained bound Cu,Zn-SOD that could be solubilized with a detergent, and to lesser degree with 0.5m NaCl. Both the cytosolic and mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SODs were isolated and compared. They have identical molecular mass, cyanide sensitivity, SDS sensitivity, heat stability, and chloroform + ethanol stability. Tissue from Cu,Zn-SOD knockout mice was entirely devoid of Cu,Zn-SOD; indicating that the cytosolic and the intermembrane space Cu,Zn-SODs are coded for by the same gene. The significance of this distribution of the SODs is discussed.

Superoxide, the first intermediate encountered on this pathway, is capable of: initiating free radical chain oxidations; inactivating specific enzymes; and leading to the production of more powerful oxidants by liberating Fe(II) from the [4Fe-4S] clusters of dehydratases and by reacting with nitric oxide (1Fridovich I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 893: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The damaging potential of superoxide is muted by SODs,1 that catalyze its dismutation to oxygen plus hydrogen peroxide; as well as by superoxide reductases, that catalyze the reduction of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide (2Lombard M. Houee-Levin C. Touati D. Fontecave M. Niviere V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5032-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). When the subcellular distribution of SOD activity was first explored by fractionation of liver, the cytosol was found to contain a Cu,Zn-SOD and the mitochondrial matrix a Mn-SOD. At that time Cu,Zn-SOD was also noted in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, and in nuclei (3Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3582-3592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic localization of Cu,Zn-SOD and the mitochondrial location of Mn-SOD was subsequently verified by means of colloidal gold immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy (5Chang L.Y. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Crapo J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 6Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). However, the presence of Cu,Zn-SOD in the intermembrane space of mitochondria was called into question and attributed to contamination of mitochondrial fractions with lysosomes and the presence of Cu,Zn-SOD in lysosomes (7Geller B.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8945-8952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report a painstaking reinvestigation of the distribution of SODs in rat liver and find that there is indeed a Cu,Zn-SOD in the intermembrane space of mitochondria that it is the same gene product as the cytosolic Cu,Zn-SOD. Culotta and associates 2Sturtz, L. A., Diekert, K., Jensen, L. T., Lill, R., and Culotta, V. C. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in press. 2Sturtz, L. A., Diekert, K., Jensen, L. T., Lill, R., and Culotta, V. C. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in press. independently, and in parallel, investigated the situation in yeast and have the same findings. We also find the Cu,Zn-SOD strongly associated with intracellular reticular membranes isolated as microsomes. Nycodenz was from Invitrogen Life Technologies. Xanthine oxidase was from Roche Molecular Diagnostics Corp. Rabbit anti-Mn-SOD antibody, sheep anti-Cu,Zn-SOD antibody, HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and HRP-conjugated anti-sheep IgG were from Upstate Biotechnology. SP-Sepharose, nitrocellulose membranes, and the ECL kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cytochrome c was from Fluka Chemika, while AcA54, xanthine, NAD, l-lactic acid,l-malate, uric acid, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, benzylamine hydrochloride, and Lubrol PX were from Sigma. Broad range prestained SDS-PAGE standards were from Bio-Rad. Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed and the livers were promptly removed and placed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (200 mm mannitol, 50 mmsucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl) at pH 7.4. After mincing with scissors and washing to remove blood, the liver was homogenized in a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer with a Teflon piston, using 10 ml of the homogenization buffer per 2.5 g of tissue. Centrifugation at successively higher speeds yielded the following fractions: crude nuclear fraction at 1,000 ×g for 10 min; heavy mitochondria at 3,000 ×g for 10 min; light mitochondria at 20,000 ×g for 20 min; and microsomes at 144,000 × gfor 90 min. The final supernatant was the cytosolic fraction. Each successive pellet was washed three times with the homogenization buffer. The centrifuges used were the Avanti J-25 centrifuge and the Optima XL-100K ultracentrifuge, both from Beckman. The procedures recommended by Nycomed Pharma and Invitrogen Life Technologies were followed (www.nycomed-diagnostics.com and www.invitrogen.com). Nycodenz was dissolved to 50% (w/v) in buffer containing 5 mmTris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.4. This stock solution was diluted with buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.4. The nuclear pellet was suspended in 25% Nycodenz and 7.5 ml was then overlaid onto the following discontinuous Nycodenz gradient: 3 ml at 50%, 3 ml at 40%, 4.5 ml at 34%, and 6 ml at 30%. The sample on this gradient was topped off with 6 ml of 20% Nycodenz before sealing the tube. The heavy and light mitochondrial pellets suspended in 10 ml of 25% Nycodenz were placed on the following discontinuous Nycodenz gradients: 4 ml of 34% and 7 ml of 30% and this was topped off with 7 ml of 23% and finally 2 ml of 20%. The sealed tubes were centrifuged for 90 min at 52,000 × g at 4 °C. The bands of particles seen after centrifugation have been identified by Nycomed Pharma and Invitrogen Life Technologies as follows: nuclei at the 40/50% interface; peroxisomes at the 34/40% interface; mitochondria at the 25/30% interface, lysosomes at the 15/20% interface, and Golgi membranes at the 10/15% interface. SOD activity was assayed by the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c method (8McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mn-SOD was distinguished from Cu,Zn-SOD by assaying in the presence of 50 µm and then 2 mm NaCN (9Geller B.L. Winge D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 128: 86-92Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under our conditions the Cu,Zn-SOD was 24% inhibited by 50 µm cyanide and 93% inhibited at 2 mm cyanide. Mn-SOD was not inhibited at these levels of cyanide. Hemoglobin, as an erythrocyte marker, was measured by absorbance at 409 nm (7Geller B.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8945-8952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); acid phosphatase, as a lysosomal marker, by the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (10Luchter-Wasylewska E. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); urate oxidase, as a peroxisomal marker, at 290 nm (11Crane D. Holmes R. Masters C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); lactate dehydrogenase, as a cytosolic marker, at 340 nm (12Chang G.G. Huang S.M. Chiou S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); fumarase, as a mitochondrial matrix marker, at 250 nm (13Hill R.L. Bradshaw R. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 91-99Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar); cytochrome coxidase, as a mitochondrial inner membrane marker, at 550 nm (14Wharton D.C. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1328) Google Scholar); sulfite oxidase, as a mitochondrial intermembrane space marker, at 550 nm (15Cohen H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 359-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and monoamine oxidase, as a mitochondrial outer membrane marker, by the oxidation of benzylamine (16Schnaitman C. Erwin V.G. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 719-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). All assays were repeated 5 times. All membrane fractions and samples for cytochrome coxidase assay were treated with 0.1% Lubrol for enzyme assays. Samples were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, and were then blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes under semi-dry conditions using the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot. After blocking by soaking in 5% dry milk proteins in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 mNaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, at pH 7.4 and room temperature for 1 h; the membranes were soaked with 1:500 sheep anti-Cu,Zn-SOD or 1:1000 rabbit anti-Mn-SOD for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed and soaked with HRP-conjugated anti-sheep IgG (1:2000) or with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) for 40 min at room temperature. The membranes were finally washed four times and then the HRP-containing bands were detected by luminol chemiluminescence with the ECL kit. Mitochondria isolated on Nycodenz gradients were separated into outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, and matrix fractions according to Greenawalt (17Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the mitoplast fraction was subjected to 3 cycles of freezing and thawing and was then centrifuged at 144,000 × g for 90 min. The membrane fractions were washed 3 times with PBS to remove soluble proteins derived from the matrix or intermembrane spaces. The procedure developed for isolation of Cu,Zn-SOD from bovine heart (18Keele Jr., B.B. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2875-2880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was applicable, with minor modifications. Thus ion exchange chromatography was performed on SP-Sepharose and gel filtration on AcA54. The protein content of purified Cu,Zn-SOD was determined by the Biuret method (19Layne E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 447-454Crossref Scopus (2718) Google Scholar) and protein mixtures were assayed by the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad reagent. When assaying liver from Cu,Zn-SOD knockout mice, the tissue extracts were purified through the acetone precipitation step before being assayed. This was done with and without an internal standard of rat liver mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SOD to ensure our ability to recover small amounts of activity. Native molecular weights were determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation in a model XL-A Beckman analytical ultracentrifuge as previously described (21Benov L. Sage H. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 240: 305-310Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry measurements were made on a Micromass Quattro LC (Altrincham, United Kingdom) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a pneumatically assisted electrostatic ion source operating at atmospheric pressure and in a positive ion mode. Apo-protein SOD samples in 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid were analyzed by loop injection into a stream of 50% aqueous acetonitrile flowing at 10 µl/min. Native SOD samples were electrosprayed in 0.01 m ammoniun acetate. Spectra were acquired in the multichannel analyzer mode fromm/z 600–1400 (scan time 5 s). The mass scale was calibrated using the multiply charged envelope of myoglobin (16951.48 Da). The raw mass spectra were transformed to a molecular mass scale using a maximum entropy based method (Max Ent) which uses the MemSys5 program (Max Ent Solutions Ltd., Cambridge, UK) and is part of the Micromass Mass Lynx software suite. When rat liver was homogenized in isotonic buffer and fractionated, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the soluble cytosolic fraction (144,000 × g supernatant) contained abundant Cu,Zn-SOD and no detectable Mn-SOD while the heavy and the light mitochondrial fractions contained both SODs with Mn-SOD predominating. Surprisingly, the microsomal fraction contained Cu,Zn-SOD. Lactate dehydrogenase was followed as a cytosol marker and cytochrome c oxidase as a mitochondrial marker. Lactate dehydrogenase was found mostly in the cytosol, with a small amount in the microsomes; while cytochromec oxidase was found only in the mitochondrial fractions. These results, based on both activity assays and on immunoassays, are shown in Fig. 1, A andB. The particulate fractions, obtained by differential centrifugation of the liver homogenates, were subfractionated in Nycodenz gradients and assayed for the SODs and the various marker proteins, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data in Fig.2A demonstrate that: the nuclear fraction was contaminated with erythrocytes and some lysosomes; the heavy mitochondrial fraction contained some erythrocytes and lysosomes at the 20/23% and at the 23/25% Nycodenz boundaries; but not at the 25/30% boundary. The 30/34% boundary of the heavy mitochondria showed contamination with peroxisomes. The light mitochondrial fraction contained lysosomes at the 20/23 and at the 23/25% boundary and both lysosomes and peroxisomes at the 25/30% boundary; while the 30/34% boundary was almost all peroxisomes. Selected bands of particles from Nycodenz density gradients, identified by arrows in Fig. 2A, were assayed for SOD activity using cyanide to distinguish Cu,Zn-SOD from Mn-SOD and this data is shown in Fig. 2B. The heavy mitochondrial fraction 25/30, that had been found free of erythrocyte, lysosomal, and peroxisomal markers, contained both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD in the activity ratio 1:5. The light mitochondrial fraction 20/23, that had been found to contain abundant lysosomal marker activity, was rich in Cu,Zn-SOD but contained only traces of Mn-SOD. The light mitochondrial fractions 25/30 and 30/34 contained progressively less Cu,Zn-SOD and small amounts of Mn-SOD. The identities of the SODs were further probed immunochemically by immunoblotting and these results are shown in Fig. 2C. In agreement with the results of activity assays using cyanide the heavy mitochondrial fraction 25/30 contained abundant Mn-SOD and much less of Cu,Zn-SOD. This is the fraction which was free of lysosomal and peroxisomal markers and is therefore taken to be pure mitochondria. The light mitochondrial fraction 25/30 contained both SODs, with Cu,Zn-SOD predominant, in keeping with its content of lysosomal marker activity. The light mitochondrial fraction 30/34 exhibited a trace of Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD. The heavy mitochondrial fraction 25/30, which was found free of non-mitochondrial markers, was subfractionated and assayed for several marker activities and for SODs. Fig. 3A illustrates the result of the marker assays. The matrix fraction contained primarily the matrix marker fumarase, while the inner membrane fraction contained primarily cytochrome c oxidase, as expected, but also a substantial amount of the outer membrane marker monoamine oxidase. The intermembrane space contained abundant sulfite oxidase and was practically free of other markers and the outer membrane fraction showed mostly monoamine oxidase. Immunoblotting demonstrated that the intermembrane space contained Cu,Zn-SOD, but not Mn-SOD; while the matrix and the inner membrane contained Mn-SOD, but no Cu,Zn-SOD. The Mn-SOD that was associated with the inner membrane persisted despite three washings with PBS. After incubation with PBS, PBS + 0.5m NaCl, or PBS + 0.1% Lubrol for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 144,000 × g for 30 min, the 0.5m NaCl and 0.1% Lubrol supernatants from the inner membrane showed about 3 and 8 times higher Mn-SOD activity, respectively, than did the PBS supernatant (data not shown). The Cu,Zn-SOD was isolated from both the cytosolic and the mitochondrial fractions of rat liver. The heavy mitochondrial Nycodenz fraction 25/30 was used, since it was demonstrably free of non-mitocondrial markers, and the 144,000 ×g supernatant fraction was taken to be cytosol. The results of these isolation procedures are given in TablesI and IIand Fig. 4, the tables record a 45-fold purification of the Cu,Zn-SOD from cytosol and a 1,556-fold purification of Cu,Zn-SOD from mitochondria. We can thus estimate that Cu,Zn-SOD constitutes ∼2% of the total protein of the cytosolic fraction and only ∼0.06% of the total protein of mitochondria. Since only ∼6% of total liver mitochondrial protein is in the intermembrane space (22Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson D.J. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, New York1994: 657Google Scholar) we can correct the estimated 0.06% by multiplying it by 16.7 to get ∼1%, thus the concentration of Cu,Zn-SOD in the intermembrane space (∼1%) is not very different from its concentration in the cytosol (2%). We can also estimate that mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SOD constitutes ∼2.8% of the total Cu,Zn-SOD from Tables I and II. It should be noted that the specific activities of the Cu,Zn-SOD was ∼4,700 units/mg whether isolated from cytosol or mitochondria. Fig. 4 shows that the mobility on 15% SDS-PAGE was identical for the Cu,Zn-SODs from both sources.Table IPurification of rat cytosolic Cu,Zn-SODPreparation stageVolumeProteinTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldFold purificationmlmg/mlmgunitsunits/mg%units/mgCytosol (144,000 supernatant)50022.411,2001,176,0001051001EtOH/CHCl36008.45,0401,038,240206882Acetone precipitation435.5142161,73811391411AcA541.028.428108,4883820936SP-Sepharose0.626.61675,3474721645 Open table in a new tab Table IIPurification of rat mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SODPreparation stageVolumeProteinTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldFold purificationmlmg/mlmgunitsunits/mg%units/mgMitochondria (HM25/30)16558.39,62028,85931001EtOH/CHCl32008.61,72024,08014835Acetone precipitation1.03.43.44,420130015433AcA540.23.80.83,5474667121556 Open table in a new tab The Cu,Zn-SODs derived from cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were: isolatable by the same procedure, of identical specific activities and indistinguishable on SDS-PAGE. Nevertheless it remained possible that they might differ in subtle ways that could be detected in terms of sensitivity to inhibition by the superoxide analogue cyanide, or in terms of thermal stability. The data in Fig.5 demonstrate that Cu,Zn-SODs isolated from the cytosolic fraction, or from the pure mitochondrial fraction, are indistinguishable in their sensitivities to cyanide inhibition. Thus the concentration of NaCN needed for 50% inhibition of cytosolic and mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SODs was 230 µm in both cases. Fig. 6, A and B,make the same point with regard to inactivation at 70 and 80 °C. Cu,Zn-SOD is stable to SDS but Mn-SOD is not (9Geller B.L. Winge D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 128: 86-92Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We examined the SDS stability of cytosolic and mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SODs and both were stable for 24 h under the conditions of Geller and Winge (9Geller B.L. Winge D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 128: 86-92Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (data not shown).Figure 6Effect of heating on cytosolic and mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SOD.A, heating at 70 °C.B, heating at 80 °C. The purified cytosolic and mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SOD were incubated at 70 or 80 °C in 2.5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and samples were taken at intervals for assay of residual activity. All enzyme activities were determined 5 times, and the mean and standard deviations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The native molecular weight of the Cu,Zn-SODs isolated from the cytosolic and the mitochondrial fractions were determined by analytical sedimentation equilibrium. They were found to be identical to within the limits of precision of the method,i.e. 31,800 and 31,400 daltons. The mass of the subunits were found by electrospray mass spectrometry to be 15,820 and 15,818 daltons, respectively. These results are given in TableIII.Table IIIMass of Cu,Zn-SODsAnalytical centrifugationElectrospray mass spectrometrydaltonsCytosolic Cu,Zn-SOD31,80015,820Mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SOD31,40015,818 Open table in a new tab The identical properties of the Cu,Zn-SODs isolated from cytosol and mitochondria suggested that they might be the product of one gene. This was established by examining liver from normal control mice, transgenic mice that overexpress Cu,Zn-SOD, and knockout mice that do not express Cu,Zn-SOD. The results in Fig. 7 show that the overexpressing mice (OE1 and OE2) had 2.5 times more Cu,Zn-SOD than the controls (CT1 and CT2); while the knockout mice (KO1 and KO2) had no detectable Cu,Zn-SOD. Since the mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SOD accounted for only ∼2.8% of the total Cu,Zn-SOD, we processed the extract of knockout mouse livers through the acetone precipitation step of the purification procedure (Tables I and II), prior to assaying them for Cu,Zn-SOD activity. To ensure the validity of this procedure one aliquot of each liver extract was doped with an internal standard of rat liver mitochondrial Cu,Zn-SOD, added to 1.7 units/mg of protein. This is the amount of Cu,Zn-SOD derived from mitochondria in wild type mouse liver extract. After the partial purification, no Cu,Zn-SOD activity was found in the fractions from the KO1 and KO2 mouse livers; while the aliquots that had been doped with Cu,Zn-SOD yielded fractions containing 50 units/mg of Cu,Zn-SOD activity. This procedure would have easily detected SOD in the knockout extracts, had it been present at even 0.5% the amount expected to have derived from mitochondria. All expressed the same level of Mn-SOD. It thus appears that all the Cu,Zn-SOD in murine liver, and by extension in rat liver, is the product of one gene. Fractionation of liver homogenate by differential sedimentation into nuclear, heavy, and light mitochondria, microsomal, and soluble fractions, followed by subfractionation on Nycodenz gradients; yielded fractions that were, on the basis of marker activities, pure mitochondria and nearly pure peroxisomes and lysosomes. The mitochondria contained both Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD, the lysosomes only Cu,Zn-SOD, and the peroxisomes traces of both SODs, the cytosolic fractions contained only Cu,Zn-SOD. Further fractionation of the pure mitochondria demonstrated that the Cu,Zn-SOD was in the intermembrane space while the Mn-SOD was both in the matrix and associated with the inner membrane. The presence of Mn-SOD in the inner membrane fraction and Cu,Zn-SOD in the microsomal fraction, that could be solubilized with a detergent and also with 0.5 m NaCl, is reminiscent of the finding of lactate and malate dehydrogenases associated with chicken liver microsomes (23Sagrista M.L. Bozal J. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Solubilization with detergent could signify enclosure of the SOD in membrane vesicles, but solubilization by NaCl indicates binding to the surface of the membranes by electrostatic forces. Since phospholipids impart a negative charge to biological membranes; cations, including protons, will be concentrated adjacent to these membranes. Hence the pH adjacent to the membranes will be lower than in the bulk solution and superoxide approaching the membranes would be more protonated than superoxide in the bulk. Since hydroperoxyl radical (HO⨪2) is a stronger oxidant of unsaturated lipids than superoxide (24Bielski B.H. Arudi R.L. Sutherland M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4759-4761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it may be important to have SOD bound to membrane to intercept incoming superoxide. Parallels may be usefully drawn between the localization of SOD activities in mitochondria and in Escherichia coli; thus in the Gram-negative bacterium the inducible Mn-SOD associates with DNA and is most abundant in the central portion of the cell that contains the nucleoid (25Steinman H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28629-28634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); while the homologous and constitutive Fe-SOD is concentrated in the periphery of the cells, closest to the inner membrane. There is, in addition, a Cu,Zn-SOD found in the periplasmic space. The lessons to be derived from this distribution are that: there are multiple sites of superoxide generation, that superoxide does not readily cross membranes, and that superoxide cannot be allowed a long half-life in cells and consequently must be dealt with by a SOD close to its site of generation. When applied to mitochondria these musings lead to the following deductions: superoxide made on the inner surface of the inner membrane will be largely dealt with by the Mn-SOD bound to that surface; superoxide made on the outer surface of the inner membrane, and hence entering the intermembrane space, will be scavenged by the Cu,Zn-SOD in that space; superoxide is probably also made in the matrix space and that will be dealt with by the matrix Mn-SOD. Mitochondria are considered to be the major source of superoxide in eukaryotic cells because they consume most of the oxygen used by these cells and because respiring submitochondrial particles have been shown to convert 1–2% of the oxygen consumed into superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. The distribution of the SODs in mitochondria make it very unlikely, however, that superoxide made in intact mitochondria could escape to the cytosol. Thus any superoxide entering, or made in, the intermembrane space would be dismuted by the Cu,Zn-SOD or oxidized by the ferricytochrome c in that space. Nishijima et al. (26Nishijima J. Mizuno M. Nasu J. Kiso T. Uesu T. Maga T. Okada H. Tomoda J. Yamada G. Tsuji T. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 29: 215-220Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have reported on the distribution of Cu,Zn-SOD in gastric mucosa using immunoelectron microscopy and noted this enzyme mainly in the cytoplasm but also associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria, and partially in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclei. Since they dealt with fixed sections it is understandable that the intermembrane Cu,Zn-SOD should have appeared to be associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. We also detected the Cu,Zn-SOD in the microsomal fraction. This Cu,Zn-SOD could be solubilized with 0.5 m NaCl or more effectively by 0.1% Lubrol, for 30 min at 0 °C (data not shown). The question of how some Cu,Zn-SOD comes to reside in the intermembrane space of mitochondria while most of it remains in the cytosol has been answered by Culotta and associates.2 Thus they found, in yeast, that the apoenzyme can cross the outer membrane and that it is trapped in the intermembrane space when metallated by the copper chaperone of superoxide dismutase in that space. The significance of SODs bound to membranes requires further comment. Polyanionic macromolecules or polyanionic surfaces such as biological membranes will concentrate cations from the bulk solution. This applies to protons and the result has been calculated to be a ∼2 pH unit drop in pH immediately adjacent to the polyanionic macromolecule (27Lamm G. Pack G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The pKa of the hydroperoxyl radical (HO⨪2) is ∼4.8 (29Bielski B.H. Cabelli D.E. Arudi R.L. Ross A.B. J. Phys. Chem. 1985; 14: 1041-1100Crossref Scopus (1775) Google Scholar) and HO⨪2 is a much stronger oxidant than superoxide (30Benson S.W. Nangia P.S. J. Am. Chem.

It follows that superoxide diffusing forwards the polyanionic surface of the membrane could, if allowed to closely approach that surface, protonate to HO⨪2 and then oxidize membrane components, such as polyunsaturated lipids. SOD bound to the membrane could prevent this by scavenging superoxide prior to its protonation.

Among candidates proposed, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol is one of the most potent activators (5Spencer T.A. Li D. Russel J.S. Collins J.L. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Moore L.B. Galardi C.M. McKee D.D.

At least in certain cell culture systems, this compound is formed via a shunt in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (6Spencer T.A. Acc. Chem.

Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). These compounds are formed as transient intermediates in steroid hormone synthesis; thus, their distribution is limited.The first demonstration of the importance of LXRα for maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis came with results from studies using mice deficient in that receptor (7Peet D.J.

Upon feeding a high cholesterol diet, the livers of the LXRα −/− mice become engorged with cholesterol, which was shown to be caused by a failure to up-regulate CYP7A1 and bile acid synthesis as a response to cholesterol overload. Subsequently, several genes of importance for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism have been shown to be responsive to LXR. Included in that list is a group of genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport (ABCA1, 2Especially in older literature, 27-hydroxycholesterol may be called 26-hydroxycholesterol or 25(R),26-hydroxycholesterol.

This condition is characterized by defective formation of nascent HDL and extremely low levels of circulating apoA-I-containing lipoproteins. Before the realization that ABCA1 is an LXR-responsive gene, it had been shown that loading of human monocyte-derived macrophages with cholesterol would induce the expression of that gene and, conversely, that cholesterol unloading would decrease the expression (21Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). These cells do not synthesize steroid hormones and therefore not 20(S)- or 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. We also found it counterintuitive that overload of cholesterol, well known to down-regulate early steps in cholesterol biosynthesis, would induce formation of intermediates in this pathway, including 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, and hypothesized that some other derivative of cholesterol would mediate the activation of LXR in cholesterol-loaded cells.Sterol 27-hydroxylase, encoded by the CYP27 gene, is an enzyme with multiple functions (recently reviewed in Ref. 22Javitt N.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the liver, its primary function is to hydroxylate bile acid intermediates such as cholestane-3α,7α,12α,-triol, thereby initiating side chain degradation. In extrahepatic tissues and in liver, the enzyme hydroxylates cholesterol to yield 27-hydroxycholesterol2and cholestenoic acid. 27-Hydroxycholesterol is the most abundant hydroxycholesterol in human circulation, with average concentrations of about 0.4 µm in normal subjects (23Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The absence of a functional sterol 27-hydroxylase is the cause of the rare inherited metabolic disorder cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) (24Oftebro H. Björkhem I. Skrede S. Schreiner A. Pedersen J.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 1418-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Cali J.J. Hsieh C.-L. Francke U. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7779-7783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CTX patients have a complex phenotype, partly reflecting the importance of CYP27 for bile acid synthesis (26Björkhem I. Boberg K.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2073-2099Google Scholar). Thus, high levels of toxic bile acid intermediates circulate in these patients. There are, however, other features of CTX that are not readily explained by the bile acid biosynthetic defect but are compatible with the notion of a defective formation of endogenous LXR ligands. For example, intracellular cholesterol is elevated in CTX patients, and premature atherosclerosis is relatively common despite low to normal LDL cholesterol levels. A single study (27Shore V. Salen G. Cheng F.W. Forte T. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Lindgren F.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which has not been confirmed (28Fujiyama J. Kuriyama M. Arima S. Shibata Y. Nagata K. Takenaga S. Tanaka H. Osame M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1991; 200: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), reported very low HDL levels in CTX patients. This would be expected if the absence of CYP27 caused a low intracellular LXR tone leading to low ABCA1-mediated high density lipoprotein formation.To determine the identity of the LXR ligands formed as a response to cholesterol overload, we treated human primary monocyte-derived macrophages with acetylated LDL and determined oxysterol formation. A dose dependence between cholesterol loading, formation of 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid, and activation of LXR-responsive genes was observed. In a coactivator association experiment, 27-hydroxycholesterol was shown to activate LXR. We were then able to show that transient or stable transfection of CYP27 into HEK293 cells confers activation of LXR-responsive genes. Finally, in primary fibroblasts derived from a patient deficient in CYP27 activity, LXR activation in response to cholesterol loading was impaired. We conclude that intracellular 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol is an important pathway for the generation of LXR agonists upon cholesterol loading.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll of the DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Vectors and cells (293-Tet-Off) for the generation of tetracycline-regulated stably transfected cells were obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The expression vector pcDNA3.1 was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Human low density lipoprotein was obtained by sequential ultracentrifugation as described (29Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Acetylation of LDL was performed according to the method of Goldstein et al. (30Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Steroids were obtained from Sigma, Steraloids, (Newport, RI), or Research Plus (Bayonne, NJ). Cholestenoic acid was kindly provided by Dr. Norman B. Javitt (New York University, New York, NY).Cell CultureHuman skin fibroblasts from a CTX patient were kindly provided by Dr. Ingemar Björkhem (Huddinge University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden). This patient has been extensively characterized, and the mutation has been identified (R441W). 3I. Björkhem, personal communication. This mutation has also been described and characterized in a number of Japanese patients (31Wakamatsu N. Hayashi M. Kawai H. Kondo H. Gotoda Y. Nishida Y. Kondo R. Tsuji S. Matsumoto T. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1999; 67: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Control human skin fibroblasts were obtained from the ATCC (catalog no. CRL-2201). Experiments with both normal and CTX fibroblasts were performed between passages 14 and 19. Fibroblasts were cultured in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose), supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate).Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293; ATCC catalog no. CRL-1573) were cultured in medium B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose), supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate). Tet-293-based cell lines were cultured in medium C (medium A supplemented with 100 µg/ml hygromycin and 100 µg/ml G418) supplemented with 2 µg/ml doxycycline as specifically stated. Transfection of 293 and Tet-293 cells was accomplished using LipofectAmine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions given by the manufacturer. Human primary monocytes were prepared as described (32Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1149-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and differentiated to macrophages by culturing for 7 days in Teflon jars in medium D (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 12% human serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate) (33Hailman E.

They were then plated at a density of 1 million cells/well (12-well plate) in medium D. Loading with acetylated LDL at concentrations specified elsewhere was performed for 72 h before harvesting cells and media for analysis with GC-MS and quantitative real time PCR. All determinations of cell protein were done after dissolution in 0.1 n NaOH using the BCA kit from Pierce according to the instructions by the manufacturer.All cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide.Co-activator Association AssaysA homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay was used to examine the ligand-dependent interaction of LXRα or LXRβ with the co-activator steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) as we have previously described (34Zhou G. Cummings R. Li Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1594-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, 198 µl of reaction mixture (50 mm HEPES, 125 mm KF, 0.125% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.05% casein, 5 nm GST-LXR LBD, 2 nmanti-GST-(Eu)K, 10 nm biotin-SRC-1-(568–780), 20 nm SA/XL665) were added to each well. The testing compounds in Me2SO were added to the appropriate wells. The reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by measurement of fluorescence reading on a Discovery instrument (Packard). The results were expressed as the ratio, multiplied by a factor of 104, of the emission intensity at 665 nm to that at 620 nm.RNA IsolationTotal RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the instructions given by the manufacturer, with the exception that 1-bromo-3-chloropropane (Sigma) was substituted for chloroform. The RNA was treated with DNase (Ambion) before analysis by real time quantitative RT-PCR.Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan)Real time quantitative PCR analysis (35Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (4970) Google Scholar) was used to determine the relative levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, SREBP-1c, CYP27, SCD, LXRα, and LXRβ mRNA. Reverse transcription and PCRs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems; TaqMan Gold RT-PCR protocol and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix). Sequence-specific amplification was detected with an increasing fluorescent signal of FAM (reporter dye) during the amplification cycle. Amplification of the mRNA for the human 23-kDa highly basic protein (HBP), also called ribosomal protein L13a, was performed in the same reaction on all samples tested as an internal control for variations in RNA amounts. Levels of the different mRNAs were subsequently normalized to HBP mRNA levels.Primers and Fluorogenic ProbesOligonucleotide primers and TaqMan probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) and were synthesized by Applied Biosystems.

Open table in a new tab cDNA CloningA full-length expressible cDNA encoding human CYP27 was obtained by single-tube RT-PCR using RNA from human primary monocyte-derived macrophages. A Titan RT-PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Primers used were AAAGCGGCCGCAGGCGCGCGAGCACAACCCAT (forward primer, includes a NotI restriction site) and AAAGAATTCGAGCCTCTAGGACAAGCCCCAGCAA (reverse primer, includes anEcoRI restriction site). The following program was used for the Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler: reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min, denaturing at 94 °C for 2 min, 10 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, elongation at 68 °C for 90 s, and 30 more cycles with the elongation time increased by 5 s/cycle, concluded with a final elongation step at 68 °C for 7 min. After purification from agarose gel, the amplified fragment was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1-His5 using the Topo TA cloning kit from Invitrogen, yielding plasmid pcDNA3.1-hCYP27. A full-length cDNA encoding the human StAR protein was obtained by RT-PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1-His5 in the same manner, using human adrenal gland mRNA (CLONTECH). The primers used were CCACCACTGCCACATTTGCCAGGAA (forward primer) and CAGTTGGGAACAGCAGGCTGGTCTT (reverse primer), and the temperature program was identical to that used for amplification of CYP27. The resulting plasmid was designated as pcDNA3.1-hStAR. The endogenous stop codon was included in the reverse primer for both CYP27 and StAR to prevent incorporation of a His tag in the expressed protein, which may have interfered with activity.Stable Cell LinesA Tetracycline-suppressible HEK293 Cell Line Expressing Human CYP27The insert from pcDNA3.1-hCYP27 was subcloned into the plasmid pTRE2 (CLONTECH) using standard molecular biology techniques (36Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: Sambrook J.F. Russell D.W. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pTRE2-hCYP27. This plasmid encodes human sterol 27-hydroxylase under the control of a tetracycline response element and a minimal CMV promoter. This plasmid and plasmid pTK-hyg (CLONTECH), which expresses a hygromycin resistance gene, were cotransfected into 293-Tet-Off cells (CLONTECH), a stable cell line enabling the suppression by tetracycline or doxycycline of genes under control of a tetracycline response element. LipofectAmine (Life Technologies) was used as a transfection reagent according to the instructions given by the manufacturer. After 3 weeks of selection in medium C supplemented with 2 µg/ml doxycycline, several clones were isolated. The clones were screened for CYP27 expression by plating on 60-mm dishes at a density of 1 million cells/dish and cultured in medium C for 48 h in the presence or absence of 2 µg/ml doxycycline. RNA was prepared and analyzed by quantitative real time RT-PCR for induction of CYP27 in the absence of doxycycline, and medium was collected and analyzed by GC-MS for accumulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid. One clone, designated XF-4, showed a 3-fold induction of CYP27 mRNA expression in the absence of doxycycline. Medium concentrations of 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid were 72 and 10 nmol/liter, respectively, in the suppressed state and 90 and 140 nmol/liter, respectively, in the induced state after a 48-h incubation in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum.An HEK293 Cell Line Expressing Human CYP27 and Human StAR Constitutively and a Control Cell LineThe inserts from pcDNA3.1-hCYP27 and pcDNA3.1-hStAR were subcloned into the plasmid pIRES (CLONTECH) using standard molecular biology techniques. The resulting plasmid, p27ST, encodes the human CYP27 and the human StAR, separated by an IRES, under the control of a CMV promoter. The IRES functions as a ribosomal start site; therefore, translation can be initiated at the beginning of the mRNA transcript as well as following the IRES. This feature allows for the simultaneous functional expression of both of the two proteins when transfected into a suitable cell line. The plasmid p27ST was used to transfect 293-Tet-Off cells using LipofectAmine as described above. After 3 weeks of selection in medium C supplemented with 2 µg/ml doxycycline, several clones were isolated and propagated. The different isolated cell lines were plated on 60-mm dishes at a density of 1 million cells/dish and cultured for 24 h in medium C, and the medium was collected and analyzed by GC-MS for the presence of cholestenoic acid and 27-hydroxycholesterol. One cell line, designated XF-13, that did not have detectable 27-hydroxylase activity was saved and propagated as a control line. Another cell line, designated XF-12, demonstrated a constitutive sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, and after culturing for 24 h in medium C, the final concentration of cholestenoic acid was 220 nmol/liter (27-hydroxycholesterol not determined). This cell line was saved, propagated, and used in further experiments.Cholesterol Loading in CTX and Normal Skin FibroblastsCTX and normal skin fibroblasts were cultured and cholesterol-loaded as described by Francis et al. (37Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were set up in medium A and were allowed to reach confluence before loading with cholesterol or treatment with LXR agonist. For determination of induction of gene expression by cholesterol loading, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was changed to medium E (like medium A but without serum) supplemented with 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 30 µg/ml cholesterol or vehicle (ethanol) control. After 72 h of incubation, cells were harvested to determine loading efficiency by GC-MS and gene expression by real time PCR as described above. For determination of induction of gene expression by the LXR agonist 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, cells were incubated with that compound (10 µm) or vehicle (ethanol) in medium A for 24 h. After incubation, cells were harvested to determine gene expression by real time PCR as described above.Cholesterol Loading in HEK293 Cells Constitutively Expressing CYP27 and StARThe stable cell line XF-12 and a control cell line XF-13 were cultured in medium C to reach 80% confluence. Cholesterol loading was carried out in medium F (like medium C but without serum) supplemented with 30 µg/ml cholesterol or vehicle (ethanol) control. After 24 h of incubation, loading efficiency and gene expression were determined as described above.Gas Chromatography-Mass SpectrometryGC-MS was performed using a ThermoQuest GCQ instrument equipped with an RTX-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25-µm phase thickness; Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA). The gas chromatography program was 180 °C for 1 min, followed by a temperature gradient of 20 °C/min to 290 °C and a final elution at 290 °C for 20 min The injector was operated in the split mode (1:10 split), and the temperature was kept at 275 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The instrument was operated in the electron ionization mode with the electron energy set to 70 eV. The ion trap was scanned between m/z 50 and 550 at the rate of 1 scan/1.5 s except when used for quantitation of cholesterol, when the ion trap was used for the selected ion monitoring ofm/z 458 and 464.Determination of 27-Hydroxycholesterol and Cholestenoic AcidTo aliquots of cell media, defined amounts (500–1000 ng of each) of 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol and cholenic acid (internal standards for 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid, respectively) were added. Medium (2–3 ml) was extracted with 3 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the organic phase was collected and separated into a neutral fraction containing neutral oxysterols and an acidic fraction containing cholenic acid and cholestenoic acid (38Kaluzny M.A. Duncan L.A. Merritt M.V. Epps D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The neutral fraction was further purified using Isolute Silica columns as described (23Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), with the exception that 6 instead of 8 ml of 0.5% isopropyl alcohol in hexane was used to elute cholesterol. 27-Hydroxycholesterol and other neutral oxysterols were then eluted with 2 ml of 30% isopropyl alcohol in hexane. Prior to analysis by GC-MS, purified neutral fractions were converted to TMS ethers using Sigma Sil-A (60 °C"

Most of the knownin vivo effects of angiotensin II are mediated by AT1 receptors while the biological functions of AT2 receptors are less clear. We report here that the AT2 receptor binds directly to the AT1 receptor and thereby antagonizes the function of the AT1 receptor. The AT1-specific antagonism of the AT2 receptor was independent of AT2 receptor activation and signaling, and it was effective on different cells and on human myometrial biopsies with AT1/AT2 receptor expression.

By contrast, G-protein coupling, signaling cascades, and biological effects of AT2receptors are less defined.

However, in several systems AT2 receptor-mediated signal inhibition persists in the presence of AT2-specific antagonists (10Akashita M. Ito M. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Daviet L. Dzau V.J. Horiuchi M. J. Clin.

We previously demonstrated that AT1 receptors can form stable heterodimers with another receptor, the bradykinin B2 receptor (12AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This receptor heterodimerization is agonist-independent and modifies AT1 receptor-mediated responses (12AbdAlla S. Lother H.

Therefore we asked whether AT1receptors formed heterodimers with AT2 receptors, and whether AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization was responsible for agonist-independent effects of the AT2receptor causing inhibition of AT1 receptor stimulation.We report here that the AT2 receptor antagonizes AT1 receptor-mediated responses by direct binding to the AT1 receptor. Heterodimerization of the AT1with the AT2 receptor was detected on transfected cells expressing AT1 and AT2 receptors, on fetal fibroblasts, and on myometrial biopsies from nonpregnant and pregnant women. The AT2-mediated antagonism of the AT1receptor was released upon decrease of AT2 receptor expression, or when AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization was inhibited. Thus, the AT2 receptor antagonizes the activation of the AT1 receptor by direct binding, and is therefore the first identified example of a G-protein-coupled receptor which acts as a receptor-specific antagonist.DISCUSSIONMany different studies demonstrate that the AT2receptor inhibits different functions of the AT1 receptor (6Hein L.

However, signaling mechanisms of the AT2receptor are not clear because in contrast to the majority of seven-transmembrane domain receptors, the AT2 receptor lacks common features of G-protein coupling. Binding of angiotensin II to the AT2 receptor is not sensitive to guanine nucleotides, and angiotensin II binding to the AT2 receptor does not stimulate the guanine nucleotide exchange of heterotrimeric G-proteins (21Mukoyama M.

Interestingly, the detected AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization leading to AT1 receptor signal inhibition is also independent of angiotensin II binding to the AT2 receptor, and does not rely on AT2 receptor-stimulated G-protein activation. Thus, the finding that the AT2 receptor antagonizes AT1 receptor signaling by heterodimerization may explain some previously unresolved effects of the AT2 receptorin vivo (6Hein L. Barsh G.S.

The observation that AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization was not only detected on cultured cells but also on human myometrial biopsies strengthens this hypothesis. AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization may be relevant in vivo because decreased AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization on myometrial tissue of pregnant women correlated with increased angiotensin II responsiveness. AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization may thus modulate the angiotensin II responsiveness in humans, at least in specific organs with dual expression of AT1 and AT2 receptors.How does the AT2 receptor inhibit AT1receptor-stimulated signaling? The AT2 receptor does not sequester the active form of G-proteins as characteristic for dominant-negative receptors (17Chen S. Lin F. Xu M. Hwa J. Graham R.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4265-4271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, direct binding of the AT2 receptor to the AT1 receptor seems to inhibit AT1 receptor activation as the AT1-specific antagonism of AT2 was released when AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization was decreased during pregnancy, after expression of an AT2-antisense construct, or by a split AT2receptor. These findings are compatible with the concept that the AT2 receptor stabilizes or induces an AT1receptor conformation which can no longer undergo the conformational change necessary for G-protein activation. The observation that the AT2 receptor also inhibited signaling stimulated by a constitutive active AT1 receptor strengthens this notion. In addition to AT1 receptor antagonism, the latter finding transfers the AT2 receptor protein characteristics of an AT1-specific inverse agonist. With the caveat that many features of the classical receptor-ligand interaction theory are not applicable to a membrane protein, our data suggest that the AT2 receptor represents the first identified example of a G-protein-coupled receptor which acts as a receptor-specific antagonist. As the AT2 receptor is the member of a subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors which lack common features of G-protein coupling (21Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Horiuchi M. Sasamura H. Pratt R.E.

Binding of angiotensin II to the AT2 receptor is not sensitive to guanine nucleotides, and angiotensin II binding to the AT2 receptor does not stimulate the guanine nucleotide exchange of heterotrimeric G-proteins (21Mukoyama M.

Hamakubo T. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24543-25546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the detected AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization leading to AT1 receptor signal inhibition is also independent of angiotensin II binding to the AT2 receptor, and does not rely on AT2 receptor-stimulated G-protein activation. Thus, the finding that the AT2 receptor antagonizes AT1 receptor signaling by heterodimerization may explain some previously unresolved effects of the AT2 receptorin vivo (6Hein L. Barsh G.S. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 7Ichiki T. Labosky P.A. Shiota C. Okuyama S. Imagawa Y. Fogo A. Niimura F. Ichikawa I.

The observation that AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization was not only detected on cultured cells but also on human myometrial biopsies strengthens this hypothesis. AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization may be relevant in vivo because decreased AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization on myometrial tissue of pregnant women correlated with increased angiotensin II responsiveness. AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization may thus modulate the angiotensin II responsiveness in humans, at least in specific organs with dual expression of AT1 and AT2 receptors. How does the AT2 receptor inhibit AT1receptor-stimulated signaling? The AT2 receptor does not sequester the active form of G-proteins as characteristic for dominant-negative receptors (17Chen S. Lin F. Xu M. Hwa J. Graham R.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4265-4271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, direct binding of the AT2 receptor to the AT1 receptor seems to inhibit AT1 receptor activation as the AT1-specific antagonism of AT2 was released when AT1/AT2 receptor heterodimerization was decreased during pregnancy, after expression of an AT2-antisense construct, or by a split AT2receptor. These findings are compatible with the concept that the AT2 receptor stabilizes or induces an AT1receptor conformation which can no longer undergo the conformational change necessary for G-protein activation. The observation that the AT2 receptor also inhibited signaling stimulated by a constitutive active AT1 receptor strengthens this notion. In addition to AT1 receptor antagonism, the latter finding transfers the AT2 receptor protein characteristics of an AT1-specific inverse agonist. With the caveat that many features of the classical receptor-ligand interaction theory are not applicable to a membrane protein, our data suggest that the AT2 receptor represents the first identified example of a G-protein-coupled receptor which acts as a receptor-specific antagonist. As the AT2 receptor is the member of a subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors which lack common features of G-protein coupling (21Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Horiuchi M. Sasamura H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24539-24542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kambayashi Y. Bardhan S. Takahashi K. Tsuzuki S. Inui H. Hamakubo T. Inagami T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2095133000,"Heisenberg's principle$^1$ states that the product of uncertainties of position and momentum should be no less than Planck's constant $\hbar$. This is usually taken to imply that phase space structures associated with sub-Planck ($\ll \hbar$) scales do not exist, or, at the very least, that they do not matter. I show that this deeply ingrained prejudice is false: Non-local ""Schr\""odinger cat"" states of quantum systems confined to phase space volume characterized by `the classical action' $A \gg \hbar$ develop spotty structure on scales corresponding to sub-Planck $a = \hbar^2 / A \ll \hbar$. Such structures arise especially quickly in quantum versions of classically chaotic systems (such as gases, modelled by chaotic scattering of molecules), that are driven into nonlocal Schr\""odinger cat -- like superpositions by the quantum manifestations of the exponential sensitivity to perturbations$^2$. Most importantly, these sub-Planck scales are physically significant: $a$ determines sensitivity of a quantum system (or of a quantum environment) to perturbations. Therefore sub-Planck $a$ controls the effectiveness of decoherence and einselection caused by the environment$^{3-8}$. It may also be relevant in setting limits on sensitivity of Schr\""odinger cats used as detectors."

Since the genetic stability of mitochondrial DNA depends on the accuracy of DNA polymerase γ (pol γ), we investigated the fidelity of DNA synthesis by human pol γ. Comparison of the wild-type 140-kDa catalytic subunit to its exonuclease-deficient derivative indicates pol γ has high base substitution fidelity that results from high nucleotide selectivity and exonucleolytic proofreading. pol γ is also relatively accurate for single-base additions and deletions in non-iterated and short repetitive sequences. However, when copying homopolymeric sequences longer than four nucleotides, pol γ has low frameshift fidelity and also generates base substitutions inferred to result from a primer dislocation mechanism. The ability of pol γ both to make and to proofread dislocation intermediates is the first such evidence for a family A polymerase. Including the p55 accessory subunit, which confers processivity to the pol γ catalytic subunit, decreases frameshift and base substitution fidelity. Kinetic analyses indicate that p55 promotes extension of mismatched termini to lower the fidelity. These data suggest that homopolymeric runs in mitochondrial DNA may be particularly prone to frameshift mutation in vivo due to replication errors by pol γ.

Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7491) Google Scholar). Loss of these essential gene functions clearly induces a multitude of severe metabolic disorders, and mutation of mtDNA is the cause of inheritable mitochondrial diseases (2Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). Early reports comparing nucleotide substitutions in mtDNA from somatic tissues of different primates revealed a 10-fold higher rate of evolution for mtDNA relative to the nuclear genome (5Brown W.M.

More recently, the accumulation of deletions in mtDNA has been shown to correlate with increasing age (7Cortopassi G.A. Shibata D. Soong N.W. Arnheim N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), and a current longitudinal study strongly supports the age-dependent accumulation of non-inherited point mutations in human mtDNA (8Michikawa Y. Mazzucchelli F. Bresolin N. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Science. 1999; 286: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that mutations in mtDNA can suppress apoptosis, a situation that would favor the growth of tumor cells (9Mott J.L. Zhang D. Stevens M. Chang S. Denniger G. Zassenhaus H.P. Mutat. Res. 2001; 474: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additionally, human somatic cancer cells can acquire a homoplasmic mutant mtDNA genotype, presumably by mitotic segregation of mutant mitochondria during proliferation of tumors (10Fliss M.S.

The prevalence of mtDNA mutations in a variety of human cancers may be more than a passive association (11Penta J.S. Johnson F.M. Wachman J.T. Copeland W.C. Mutat.

Molecular genetic analyses such as these are the starting point for studying the biochemical mechanisms of mutagenesis of the mitochondrial genome. Mutations in mtDNA arise from several sources, all of which involve DNA synthesis by the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, pol γ. Spontaneous replication errors produce mismatches, and replication through unrepaired mismatches can mutate mtDNA. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses the mismatch repair homolog Msh1 that can stabilize yeast mtDNA (14Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D.

Because pol γ is a component common to each mode of mutagenesis, knowledge of its biosynthetic fidelity is critical to understanding mitochondrial mutagenesis. pol γ purified from chicken embryos or from pig liver mitochondria is accurate in vitro, with these enzymes exhibiting error frequencies at a 3-nucleotide mutational target of <3.8 × 10−6 per nucleotide and <2.0 × 10−6per nucleotide, respectively (30Kunkel T.A.

Both enzymes contain intrinsic 3′- to 5′-exonuclease activities that prefer mispaired 3′ termini. Partial inhibition of these exonuclease activities with 20 mm dGMP increases the frequency of errors, suggesting the exonucleases proofread replication errors (30Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol.

Disruption of the exonuclease motifs in the yeast MIP1 gene generates a mutator phenotype, as exhibited by a several hundred-fold increase in the spontaneous frequency of forming mitochondrial erythromycin-resistant mutants (42Foury F. Vanderstraeten S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

Also, the loss of exonuclease function of pol γ in transgenic mice resulted in the rapid accumulation of point mutations and deletions in cardiac mtDNA, and the mutagenesis was accompanied by cardiomyopathy (44Zhang D.

When associated with the catalytic subunit, the accessory subunit confers high processivity to pol γ through enhanced DNA binding (47Lim S.E. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. J. Biol.

However, the fidelity of DNA synthesis by structurally defined human pol γ with and without the accessory subunit or exonucleolytic proofreading is not known. In this report we present a comprehensive study of the fidelity of DNA synthesis by human DNA polymerase γ in vitro. We reconstituted the various forms of human pol γ and measured error rates during replication of natural DNA substrates. We also performed steady state kinetic analysis of base selection and mispair extension to determine the relative contributions of exonucleolytic proofreading and the accessory subunit to overall fidelity of replication. The recombinant catalytic subunit of human DNA polymerase γ (p140), the exonuclease-deficient form (p140 Exo−), and their His6-tagged derivatives were purified to homogeneity as described (45Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged accessory subunit (p55) was purified to homogeneity, and the heterodimeric forms of the polymerase (p140·p55 and p140 Exo−·p55) were reconstituted as described (47Lim S.E.

Protein concentration was determined relative to a BSA standard by quantitative digital imaging of protein bands that had been resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). The accuracy of DNA synthesis by human pol γ was measured by copying a single-stranded region of bacteriophage M13 DNA encoding the α-peptide region of the β-galactosidase gene. Replication errors were scored by transfection and plating on chromogenic indicator plates to score plaque colors. The necessary bacterial strains, bacteriophage M13mp2 derivatives, and all procedures related to fidelity assays have been described (51Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A.

Gap-filling reaction mixtures (30 µl) contained 25 mm HEPES·KOH (pH 7.6), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 µg/ml acetylated BSA, ∼150 ng of gapped M13mp2 DNA, and 16–220 ng p140 or p140 Exo−, as needed to fill gaps within 60 min at 37 °C. Reactions utilizing p140·p55 were supplemented with 0.1m NaCl to achieve optimal in vitro activity (47Lim S.E. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. J. Biol.

Reaction products were isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and closure of the gaps was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to transfection. Mutation frequencies were calculated as described, and specific nucleotide changes in mutant DNAs were determined by DNA sequencing. The fidelity of nucleotide selection by pol γ was determined with a polyacrylamide gel-based, single nucleotide extension assay utilizing synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides (54Boosalis M.S.

Oligonucleotides were obtained from Oligos, Etc. (Wilsonville, OR), purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ethanol precipitation, and 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Labeled primer (18-mer) and unlabeled template (36-mer) were hybridized (ratio = 1:1.1) to form the following primer-template with a recessed 3′-end: G primer, 5′-TGA CCA TGT ACA TCA GAG-3′; C template, 3′-ACT GGT ACA TGT AGT CTC AGC CTG CAT ATA GTC ACT-5′. Reaction mixtures (10 µl) contained 25 mm HEPES·KOH (pH 7.6), 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 µg/ml acetylated BSA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 pmol of primer-template, 10–30 fmol of exonuclease-deficient p140 or p140·p55, and one of the four common deoxynucleoside triphosphates. As the next correct nucleotide, TTP was varied from 0 to 0.2 µm, whereas the three incorrect nucleotides were varied from 0 to 1 mm. Following incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, reactions were terminated by the addition (10 µl) of 95% deionized formamide and 10 mm EDTA. Samples (2 µl) were boiled for 5 min and resolved by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Radioactive bands were detected with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and quantified with NIH Image software (version 1.62). To remain within the limitations of steady state analysis, only values from reactions in which less than 25% of the primer had been extended were used to calculate initial reaction velocities. Kinetic constants were estimated by linear least squares curve fitting of double-reciprocal plots. Four additional DNA substrates were constructed for mispair extension assays. Oligonucleotides were purified, labeled, and hybridized as before to generate primer-templates with recessed 3′-ends and A·C, T·C, C·C, or G·G mispairs at their 3′ termini as follows: A primer, 5′-TGA CCA TGT ACA TCA GAA-3′, and C template, 3′-ACT GGT ACA TGT AGT CTCAGC CTG CAT ATA GTC ACT-5′; T primer 5′-TGA CCA TGT ACA TCA GAT-3′, and C template, 3′-ACT GGT ACA TGT AGT CTC AGC CTG CAT ATA GTC ACT-5′; C primer, 5′-TGA CCA TGT ACA TCA GAC-3′, and C template, 3′-ACT GGT ACA TGT AGT CTC AGC CTG CAT ATA GTC ACT-5′; G primer 5′-TGA CCA TGT ACA TCA GAG-3′, and G template 3′-ACT GGT ACA TGT AGT CTG AGC CTG CAT ATA GTC ACT-5′. The composition of reactions was the same as for nucleotide insertion, except the next correct nucleotide (TTP) was varied from 0 to 1 mm. Products were analyzed, and kinetic constants were determined as before. The accuracy of DNA synthesis by human pol γ was measured in vitro by copying a single-stranded region of bacteriophage M13mp2 DNA encoding a 407-nucleotide section of the β-galactosidase gene. Correct polymerization produces DNA that yields blue M13 plaques, whereas errors are scored as light blue or colorless plaques. A broad view of replication fidelity is provided by this forward mutation assay, which scores all 12 possible single-base substitutions, each in a variety of sequence contexts, as well as additions and deletions of 199 different template nucleotides present as non-iterated or repeated sequences. We measured the fidelity of polymerization reactions catalyzed by the wild-type catalytic p140 subunit of human pol γ either alone or in the presence of its p55 accessory subunit. To determine the contribution of exonucleolytic proofreading to replication fidelity, we also measured the fidelity of exonuclease-deficient pol γ either alone or with p55. The frequencies of lacZ mutant plaques generated in the four different polymerization reactions are shown in Table I (top section). The wild-type polymerase reactions generated products whose lacZ mutant frequencies were only slightly above the background mutant frequency of the uncopied control DNA (7 × 10−4). Reactions catalyzed by the exonuclease-deficient polymerase had 1.8-fold higherlacZ mutant frequencies, indicating that this polymerase was less accurate and that the majority of the lacZ mutants contained errors made during DNA synthesis in vitro. Inclusion of the p55 accessory subunit further increased the mutant frequency for p140 Exo−, but proofreading was able to balance this apparent mild reduction in fidelity caused by p55. DNA extracted from collections of independent lacZ mutants were sequenced to classify the types of errors made by each form of the enzyme and to permit calculation of specific error rates (51Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A.

Error rates listed as ≤ fall within 2-fold of previously published values for uncopied DNA and therefore are unlikely to reflect errors made during gap-filling DNA synthesis. The background mutant frequency for uncopied control DNA was 7 × 10−4. Single-base substitutions were found in the majority of lacZmutants recovered from all four copying reactions (Table I). In the case of wild-type pol γ without p55, the average substitution error rate when considering all mispairs (≤8 × 10−6) and the rates for individual mismatches (T·dGMP and A·dAMP listed as an example, the other 10 mismatches not shown) are all “less than or equal to” values, since these values are similar to those for uncopied DNA. This indicates that the exonuclease-proficient catalytic subunit has relatively high base substitution fidelity. As expected, the exonuclease-deficient enzyme is less accurate, e.g. by ≥30-fold for the T·dGMP mismatch and by ≥14-fold for the A·dAMP mismatch (Table I). This suggests that the majority of misinsertions made by the catalytic subunit are proofread by its intrinsic exonuclease. Proofreading is also implied by the lower base substitution error rates of the wild-type p140 as compared with the exonuclease-deficient p140 when p55 is present (four columns on right side of Table I). Somewhat surprisingly, however, the substitution fidelity of the catalytic subunit is lower in the presence of the p55 subunit. For example, the exonuclease-deficient polymerase is 6-fold less accurate for the A·dAMP mismatch in the presence of p55, and overall average substitution fidelity is also somewhat lower. A similar trend toward reduced fidelity in the presence of p55 is also apparent with wild-type pol γ. For example, p55 raised the frequency of T·dGMP errors from ≤0.7 × 10−6 to 6.2 × 10−6 (Table I). Note that to detect an error in gap-filling assays, the polymerase must first make a mistake and then extend it to prevent removal upon introduction of the copied M13mp2 DNA into the E. coli host cell. Thus, p55 may increase the error rate in gap-filling assays by promoting either misinsertion, mismatch extension, or both. These possibilities are tested below. A number of the lacZ mutants recovered from the four copying reactions contained single-base deletion or addition mutations (TableI). Detailed knowledge of which deletions and additions result in a detectable color change (51Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) permits calculation of frameshift error rates that are corrected for differences in target size (e.g. the lengths of homopolymeric runs). Frameshift error rates calculated for wild-type p140 are again “less than or equal to” values, since they are similar to the background values for uncopied DNA. The only exception is the rate of 5.7 × 10−6 for deletions in homopolymeric runs of 4 or 5 nucleotides. This rate is well above the background value, indicating that p140 generates deletions in these runs despite the presence of a proofreading exonuclease that can excise terminal base·base mismatches. The exonuclease-deficient p140 is clearly less accurate, generating single-base additions and single-base deletions in a variety of sequence contexts at rates that are consistently higher than those observed with wild-type p140 (Table I). This implies that the majority of frameshift mutational intermediates made by wild-type p140 are proofread by its intrinsic exonuclease. Note that the single-base deletion error rate of exonuclease-deficient p140 increases from an average value of 1.0 × 10−6 for the 97 non-iterated nucleotides in the template sequence to an error rate of 26 × 10−6 for the 17 template nucleotides present in homopolymeric runs of 4/5. This 26-fold increase in error rate with increasing run length suggests that most of the frameshifts in repetitive sequences result from misalignments formed by DNA strand slippage (57Streisinger G.

Glutamate (Glu)1 and related excitatory amino acids are well-known neurotoxins, and their extracellular levels increase dramatically in the course of brain ischemia. The excitotoxicity hypothesis suggests that, in neuronal hypoxia/ischemia, neurodegeneration can be triggered by cytoplasmic Ca2+ overload, which occurs whenN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors are overstimulated by excessive Glu (2Lee J.M. Zipfel G.J. Choi D.W. Nature. 1999; 399: A7-A14Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Numerous pharmacological approaches have been explored to prevent or attenuate neuronal cell death in ischemia, however, no satisfactory methods have been developed (3Von Lubitz D.K. Lin R.C.

The EPO receptor (EPO-R) is a member of the type 1 superfamily of single-transmembrane cytokine receptors. EPO binding to EPO-R induces receptor oligomerization and subsequent activation by autophosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a protein-tyrosine kinase that associates with EPO-R. JAK2 phosphorylates a cytoplasmic transcription factor called signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), leading to translocation of STAT into the nucleus and regulation of transcription (8Wojchowski D.M. Gregory R.C. Miller C.P. Pandit A.K. Pircher T.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). EPO and EPO-R are also expressed in mammalian brain, where hypoxia strongly stimulates EPO production (9Marti H.H. Wenger R.H. Rivas L.A. Straumann U. Digicaylioglu M. Henn V. Yonekawa Y. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 10Morishita E. Masuda S. Nagao M. Yasuda Y. Sasaki R. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Although activation of EPO-R has been suggested to play a neuroprotective role (10Morishita E. Masuda S. Nagao M. Yasuda Y. Sasaki R. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 11Sakanaka M. Wen T.C. Matsuda S. Masuda S. Morishita E. Nagao M. Sasaki R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4635-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), little is known about the action of EPO in the nervous system. Recently, we showed that EPO inhibits Ca2+-induced dopamine release from clonal rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (12Kawakami M. Iwasaki S. Sato K. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); however, it has not yet been deduced whether EPO also suppresses neurotransmitter release from central neurons. In the present study, we investigated the effect of EPO on Glu release from cultured cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal neurons. We found that the activation of EPO-R attenuates Ca2+-induced Glu release from these neurons possibly through activation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase. We also found that EPO-R activation protects hippocampal neurons from ischemic neuronal damage through the inhibition of Glu release via exocytosis.DISCUSSIONWe showed in the present study that EPO and EMP1 inhibit Ca2+-induced Glu release from cultured cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal neurons. EPO-R activation also protected hippocampal neurons from ischemic damage by reducing the exocytosis of Glu. This is the first demonstration that EPO-R activation could exert its neuroprotective effects by presynaptic mechanisms.The expression of EPO-R in cultured cerebellar granule cells was confirmed by immunoblotting. The inhibitory effect of EPO- on Ca2+-induced Glu release was observed in a nanomolar concentration range, very close to the reported Kdfor EPO binding to the EPO-R (26Masuda S. Nagao M. Takahata K. Konishi Y. Gallyas Jr, F. Tabira T. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11208-11216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition was also induced by EMP1, another EPO-R agonist with a completely different structure and binding site on the EPO-R (22Wrighton N.C. Farrell F.X. Chang R. Kashyap A.K. Barbone F.P. Mulcahy L.S. Johnson D.L. Barret R.W. Jolliffe L.K. Dower W.J. Science. 1996; 273: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 23Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). EPO and EMP1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, a tyrosine kinase that associates with EOP-R, in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Pretreating the cells with genistein but not with genistin abolished the EPO- and EMP1-induced suppression of Glu release and the phosphorylation of JAK2. All of these results clearly indicate that in cultured cerebellar granule cells the inhibitory effect of EPO and EMP1 on Ca2+-induced Glu release is mediated through activation of the EPO-R.EPO and EMP1 inhibited Glu release induced by ionomycin. Because voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are not involved in Glu release in these conditions, inhibition must occur by modulating a step subsequent to Ca2+ entry. The onset of inhibition by EPO/EMP occurred very rapidly after application, suggesting that regulation is likely to involve post-translational modulation of a pre-existing protein. Previously, we have shown that phosphorylation of GAP-43 at Ser41 was decreased after EPO/EMP1 treatment in PC12 cells (12Kawakami M. Iwasaki S. Sato K. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, we have not detected any dephosphorylation of GAP-43 in cultured cerebellar granule cells, suggesting that this process is not necessary for EPO/EMP1-induced inhibition of neurotransmitter release (data not shown). The identity of the protein substrate(s) of tyrosine kinase essential for this modulation has yet to be elucidated. Various protein kinases, including protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and TrkA receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, are known to stimulate neurotransmitter release from a variety of neuronal preparations (27Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 28Gottschalk W.A. Jiang H. Tartaglia N. Feng L. Figurov A. Lu B. Learn. Mem. 1999; 6: 243-256PubMed Google Scholar). However, reports on protein kinases involved in negative regulation of neurotransmitter release are extremely scarce to date. We have shown for the first time that EPO-R activation inhibits Ca2+-induced catecholamine release from PC12 cells (12Kawakami M. Iwasaki S. Sato K. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Ca2+-induced Glu release from neurons of hippocampus and cerebellum. Thus, EPO-R-mediated suppression of release seems not to be restricted to any particular type of neurotransmitter, and it will be important to dissect the underlying mechanisms to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity.There are a number of reports showing that there are two phases of Glu release during ischemia (29Szatkowski M. Attwell D. Trends. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We found in the present study that Glu release in chemical ischemia was induced by at least two different mechanisms in cultured cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal neurons. In the early phase (up to 20-min treatment), Glu release was almost abolished by BoNT/B, indicating that it occurs via exocytosis of the contents of synaptic vesicles. In contrast, Glu release in the later phase was only partially inhibited by BoNT/B, suggesting that a non-exocytotic mechanism is involved, possibly by reversal of neuronal Glu transporters (30Rossi D.J. Oshima T. Attwell D. Nature. 2000; 403: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). EMP1 almost abolished Glu release in the early phase, but scarcely affected the release in the late phase of ischemia. These results indicate that during chemical ischemia the activation of EPO-R only suppressed exocytotic Glu release. The excessive release of Glu in brain ischemia is known to trigger neuronal cell death. In the present study, we found that a 20-min exposure of cultured hippocampal slices to chemical ischemia induced neuronal cell death selectively in the CA1 region and the dentate gyrus, which suggests that Glu released by exocytosis was enough to induce the neuronal cell death in ischemia. EMP1 suppressed cell death induced by the chemical ischemia for 20 min. Activation of EPO-R was involved in this process, because iEMP1, the inactive analogue of EMP1, did not produce any protective effect. Neuronal cell death induced by exogenously applied Glu was not suppressed by EMP1. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that EMP1 attenuated neuronal cell death presynaptically by inhibiting exocytotic Glu release, rather than through modification of a post-synaptic step downstream of Glu receptor activation.Previously, EPO has been reported to protect neurons against ischemia-induced cell death in living gerbils. Infusion of EPO into the lateral ventricles of gerbils prevented ischemia-induced learning disability and rescued hippocampal CA1 neurons from lethal ischemic damage (11Sakanaka M. Wen T.C.

Otsuka H. Sasaki S. Masuda S. Sasaki R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Because EPO rescued cultured neurons from NO-induced death, it was concluded that EPO exerts its neuroprotective effect by postsynaptic mechanisms, possibly by reducing the NO-mediated formation of free radicals or antagonizing their toxicity (11Sakanaka M. Wen T.C. Matsuda S. Masuda S. Morishita E. Nagao M. Sasaki R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4635-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 32Calapai G. Marciano M.C. Corica F. Allegra A. Parisi A. Frisina N. Caputi A.P. Buemi M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 11: 349-356Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). EPO also protected cultured hippocampal and cerebral cortical neurons from glutamate neurotoxicity (10Morishita E. Masuda S. Nagao M. Yasuda Y. Sasaki R. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). However, treatment of neurons with EPO ∼8 h prior to exposure to glutamate was required, and RNA and protein synthesis were also necessary, to demonstrate a neuroprotective effect. The action of the EPO-R revealed in the present study is clearly different, because EPO and EMP1 confer protection very quickly by inhibiting presynaptic functions. Thus, the activation of EPO-R seems to protect neurons from ischemic damage through multiple mechanisms, and presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms are likely to be involved in inducing protection in the early and the late phases of ischemia, respectively.Adenosine A1 receptor agonists had been used to prevent neuronal cell death in ischemia, because they depress Glu release from cortical slice preparations, however, cardiovascular side effects have constituted major obstacles to clinical implementation (3Von Lubitz D.K.

EPO has proven to be a safe therapeutic agent with minimal adverse effects (33Bernaudin M. Marti H.H. Roussel S. Divoux D. Nouvelot A. MacKenzie E.T. Petit E. J. Cereb.

Kidney Dis. 1999; 33: 1122-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, it is thought that direct delivery of EPO into the brain is not a practical approach in clinical contexts, because the blood-brain barrier effectively excludes large glycosylated molecules (35Duffy K.R. Pardridge W.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Metabolism. 1988; 37: 136-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Pardridge W.M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 713-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Recently, EPO was found to cross the blood-brain barrier and intraperitoneal administration of recombinant EPO before or up to 6 h after focal brain ischemia reduced injury (37Brines M.L. Ghezzi P. Keenan S. Agnello D. de Lanerolle N.C. Carami C. Itri L.M. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10526-10531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that EPO and EMP1 could be used therapeutically to attenuate neuronal damage in the early phase of ischemia. Further studies, including elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of JAK2-mediated inhibition of neurotransmitter release, are required with a view to developing novel strategies for neuroprotection in ischemia.

Gassmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 10Morishita E. Masuda S. Nagao M. Yasuda Y. Sasaki R. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Although activation of EPO-R has been suggested to play a neuroprotective role (10Morishita E. Masuda S. Nagao M. Yasuda Y. Sasaki R. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 11Sakanaka M. Wen T.C. Matsuda S. Masuda S. Morishita E. Nagao M. Sasaki R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4635-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), little is known about the action of EPO in the nervous system. Recently, we showed that EPO inhibits Ca2+-induced dopamine release from clonal rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (12Kawakami M. Iwasaki S. Sato K. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); however, it has not yet been deduced whether EPO also suppresses neurotransmitter release from central neurons. In the present study, we investigated the effect of EPO on Glu release from cultured cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal neurons. We found that the activation of EPO-R attenuates Ca2+-induced Glu release from these neurons possibly through activation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase. We also found that EPO-R activation protects hippocampal neurons from ischemic neuronal damage through the inhibition of Glu release via exocytosis. DISCUSSIONWe showed in the present study that EPO and EMP1 inhibit Ca2+-induced Glu release from cultured cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal neurons. EPO-R activation also protected hippocampal neurons from ischemic damage by reducing the exocytosis of Glu. This is the first demonstration that EPO-R activation could exert its neuroprotective effects by presynaptic mechanisms.The expression of EPO-R in cultured cerebellar granule cells was confirmed by immunoblotting. The inhibitory effect of EPO- on Ca2+-induced Glu release was observed in a nanomolar concentration range, very close to the reported Kdfor EPO binding to the EPO-R (26Masuda S. Nagao M. Takahata K. Konishi Y. Gallyas Jr, F. Tabira T. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11208-11216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition was also induced by EMP1, another EPO-R agonist with a completely different structure and binding site on the EPO-R (22Wrighton N.C. Farrell F.X. Chang R. Kashyap A.K. Barbone F.P. Mulcahy L.S. Johnson D.L. Barret R.W. Jolliffe L.K. Dower W.J. Science. 1996; 273: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 23Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). EPO and EMP1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, a tyrosine kinase that associates with EOP-R, in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Pretreating the cells with genistein but not with genistin abolished the EPO- and EMP1-induced suppression of Glu release and the phosphorylation of JAK2. All of these results clearly indicate that in cultured cerebellar granule cells the inhibitory effect of EPO and EMP1 on Ca2+-induced Glu release is mediated through activation of the EPO-R.EPO and EMP1 inhibited Glu release induced by ionomycin. Because voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are not involved in Glu release in these conditions, inhibition must occur by modulating a step subsequent to Ca2+ entry. The onset of inhibition by EPO/EMP occurred very rapidly after application, suggesting that regulation is likely to involve post-translational modulation of a pre-existing protein. Previously, we have shown that phosphorylation of GAP-43 at Ser41 was decreased after EPO/EMP1 treatment in PC12 cells (12Kawakami M. Iwasaki S. Sato K. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, we have not detected any dephosphorylation of GAP-43 in cultured cerebellar granule cells, suggesting that this process is not necessary for EPO/EMP1-induced inhibition of neurotransmitter release (data not shown). The identity of the protein substrate(s) of tyrosine kinase essential for this modulation has yet to be elucidated. Various protein kinases, including protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and TrkA receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, are known to stimulate neurotransmitter release from a variety of neuronal preparations (27Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 28Gottschalk W.A. Jiang H. Tartaglia N. Feng L. Figurov A. Lu B. Learn. Mem. 1999; 6: 243-256PubMed Google Scholar). However, reports on protein kinases involved in negative regulation of neurotransmitter release are extremely scarce to date. We have shown for the first time that EPO-R activation inhibits Ca2+-induced catecholamine release from PC12 cells (12Kawakami M. Iwasaki S. Sato K. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Ca2+-induced Glu release from neurons of hippocampus and cerebellum. Thus, EPO-R-mediated suppression of release seems not to be restricted to any particular type of neurotransmitter, and it will be important to dissect the underlying mechanisms to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity.There are a number of reports showing that there are two phases of Glu release during ischemia (29Szatkowski M. Attwell D. Trends. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We found in the present study that Glu release in chemical ischemia was induced by at least two different mechanisms in cultured cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal neurons. In the early phase (up to 20-min treatment), Glu release was almost abolished by BoNT/B, indicating that it occurs via exocytosis of the contents of synaptic vesicles. In contrast, Glu release in the later phase was only partially inhibited by BoNT/B, suggesting that a non-exocytotic mechanism is involved, possibly by reversal of neuronal Glu transporters (30Rossi D.J. Oshima T. Attwell D. Nature. 2000; 403: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). EMP1 almost abolished Glu release in the early phase, but scarcely affected the release in the late phase of ischemia. These results indicate that during chemical ischemia the activation of EPO-R only suppressed exocytotic Glu release. The excessive release of Glu in brain ischemia is known to trigger neuronal cell death. In the present study, we found that a 20-min exposure of cultured hippocampal slices to chemical ischemia induced neuronal cell death selectively in the CA1 region and the dentate gyrus, which suggests that Glu released by exocytosis was enough to induce the neuronal cell death in ischemia. EMP1 suppressed cell death induced by the chemical ischemia for 20 min. Activation of EPO-R was involved in this process, because iEMP1, the inactive analogue of EMP1, did not produce any protective effect. Neuronal cell death induced by exogenously applied Glu was not suppressed by EMP1. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that EMP1 attenuated neuronal cell death presynaptically by inhibiting exocytotic Glu release, rather than through modification of a post-synaptic step downstream of Glu receptor activation.Previously, EPO has been reported to protect neurons against ischemia-induced cell death in living gerbils. Infusion of EPO into the lateral ventricles of gerbils prevented ischemia-induced learning disability and rescued hippocampal CA1 neurons from lethal ischemic damage (11Sakanaka M. Wen T.C. Matsuda S. Masuda S. Morishita E. Nagao M. Sasaki R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4635-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 31Sadamoto Y. Igase K. Sakamoto M. Sato K. Otsuka H. Sasaki S. Masuda S. Sasaki R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Because EPO rescued cultured neurons from NO-induced death, it was concluded that EPO exerts its neuroprotective effect by postsynaptic mechanisms, possibly by reducing the NO-mediated formation of free radicals or antagonizing their toxicity (11Sakanaka M. Wen T.C. Matsuda S. Masuda S. Morishita E. Nagao M. Sasaki R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4635-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 32Calapai G. Marciano M.C. Corica F. Allegra A. Parisi A. Frisina N. Caputi A.P. Buemi M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 11: 349-356Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). EPO also protected cultured hippocampal and cerebral cortical neurons from glutamate neurotoxicity (10Morishita E. Masuda S. Nagao M. Yasuda Y. Sasaki R. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). However, treatment of neurons with EPO ∼8 h prior to exposure to glutamate was required, and RNA and protein synthesis were also necessary, to demonstrate a neuroprotective effect. The action of the EPO-R revealed in the present study is clearly different, because EPO and EMP1 confer protection very quickly by inhibiting presynaptic functions. Thus, the activation of EPO-R seems to protect neurons from ischemic damage through multiple mechanisms, and presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms are likely to be involved in inducing protection in the early and the late phases of ischemia, respectively.Adenosine A1 receptor agonists had been used to prevent neuronal cell death in ischemia, because they depress Glu release from cortical slice preparations, however, cardiovascular side effects have constituted major obstacles to clinical implementation (3Von Lubitz D.K. Lin R.C. Paul I.A. Beenhakker M. Boyd M. Bischofberger N. Jacobson K.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 316: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). EPO has proven to be a safe therapeutic agent with minimal adverse effects (33Bernaudin M. Marti H.H. Roussel S. Divoux D. Nouvelot A. MacKenzie E.T. Petit E. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 34Pickett J.L. Theberge D.C. Brown W.S. Schweitzer S.U. Nissenson A.R. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1999; 33: 1122-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, it is thought that direct delivery of EPO into the brain is not a practical approach in clinical contexts, because the blood-brain barrier effectively excludes large glycosylated molecules (35Duffy K.R. Pardridge W.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Metabolism. 1988; 37: 136-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Pardridge W.M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 713-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Recently, EPO was found to cross the blood-brain barrier and intraperitoneal administration of recombinant EPO before or up to 6 h after focal brain ischemia reduced injury (37Brines M.L. Ghezzi P. Keenan S. Agnello D. de Lanerolle N.C. Carami C. Itri L.M. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10526-10531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that EPO and EMP1 could be used therapeutically to attenuate neuronal damage in the early phase of ischemia. Further studies, including elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of JAK2-mediated inhibition of neurotransmitter release, are required with a view to developing novel strategies for neuroprotection in ischemia. We showed in the present study that EPO and EMP1 inhibit Ca2+-induced Glu release from cultured cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal neurons.

A single channel-forming protein is found in yeast, whereas higher eukaryotes express multiple VDACs, with humans and mice each harboring three distinct channels (VDAC1–3) encoded by separate genes. To begin to assess the functions of each of the three isoforms, the VDAC3 gene was inactivated by targeted disruption in embryonic stem cells. Here we show that mice lacking VDAC3 are healthy, but males are infertile. Although there are normal sperm numbers, the sperm exhibit markedly reduced motility. Structural defects were found in two-thirds of epididymal axonemes, with the most common abnormality being loss of a single microtubule doublet at a conserved position within the axoneme. In testicular sperm, the defect was only rarely observed, suggesting that instability of a normally formed axoneme occurs with sperm maturation. In contrast, tracheal epithelial cilia showed no structural abnormalities. In addition, skeletal muscle mitochondria were abnormally shaped, and activities of the respiratory chain complexes were reduced. These results demonstrate that axonemal defects may be caused by associated nonaxonemal components such as mitochondrial channels and illustrate that normal mitochondrial function is required for stability of the axoneme.

Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 127-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). VDACs are functionally conserved across evolution, with similar electrophysiologic characteristics shared from yeast to humans. VDACs from fungi form large voltage-gated channels that, in the open state, have been shown to preferentially conduct ATP and other anions (2Rostovtseva T. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28006-28008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Mammalian VDACs are reported to associate with the adenine nucleotide translocator at the contact points between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (3Brdiczka D. Beutner G. Ruck A. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Biofactors. 1998; 8: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). VDACs also serve as a binding site for cytosolic hexokinase, providing the enzyme with preferential access to ATP derived from oxidative phosphorylation (4Cesar M.d. C. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). There is evidence for the involvement of VDAC in the formation of the permeability transition pore (5Beutner G. Ruck A. Riede B. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and it has been reported recently that VDAC1 constitutes a pathway for the release of cytochromec during cytochrome c-dependent apoptosis (6Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 7Shimizu S. Konishi A. Kodama T. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). VDACs may participate in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism via the control of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability and compartmentation of high energy metabolites. In growth factor-dependent pro-B lymphocyte cell lines, growth factor withdrawal leads to loss of outer membrane permeability and accumulation of phosphocreatine within the intermembrane space, in association with a defect in ATP/ADP exchange (10Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that interactions between BH4 domain containing Bcl-2 family members mediate VDAC closure (7Shimizu S. Konishi A. Kodama T. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3100-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), direct evidence for this occurring in vivo is lacking. The mammalian VDACs currently consist of three family members: VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3, encoded by three separate genes (11Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol.

The organization of the mouse VDAC3 genomic locus has been described (11Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The VDAC3 targeting vector is predicted to delete a 4.1-kilobase pairBglII/NcoI fragment containing the last four exons of the VDAC3 gene. ES cell culture, electroporation, mini-Southern blot analysis of ES cell colonies, and generation of chimeras and germ line mice was as described (17Ramirez-Solis R. Davis A.C. Bradley A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 855-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Su J.G. Hsueh A.J. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 360: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). PCR genotyping of VDAC3 animals was performed using a three-primer multiplex PCR assay. The PCR primer sets used are as follows (5′–3′): neomycin resistance gene primer (CTGCGAATCGGGAGCGGCGATACCG), wild type primer (CGCCTACCTATACTCCATGCTGCC), and common primer (CCAAAGCTCTCACTAGAGCAG) (94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, 30 s, 40 cycles). The mutant PCR product (neomycin primer + common primer) is 1.1 kilobase pairs, and the wild type PCR product (wild type primer + common primer) is 600 base pairs. Total RNA was extracted from mouse adult tissues, and Northern blotting was carried out as described. To prevent probe cross-hybridization with the other VDACs, the membrane was probed with the 3′-untranslated region of the VDAC3 cDNA and then stripped and probed with a cDNA for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control for loading differences and RNA quality. Crude cell fractionation and Western blotting was performed using VDAC3-specific and VDAC1-specific antibodies, as described (19Decker W.K. Craigen W.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, wild type testes were homogenized in RSB (10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) after which 2.5× MS buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mmsucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) was immediately added. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 2 °C for 15 min at 17,000 × g to pellet both nuclei and mitochondria, and the cytoplasmic extract (C) was derived from the supernatant. To isolate the mitochondrial fraction (M), the pellet was resuspended in 1× MS buffer and centrifuged twice at 1200 × g to remove the nuclear fraction. Mitochondria were then pelleted by centrifugation at 2 °C for 15 min at 17,000 × g. Sperm counts were obtained in wild type, heterozygous, and VDAC3-deficient male mice at 10 weeks of age. Animals were weighed and sacrificed, and testes weights were recorded. Both of the cauda epididymides were excised and placed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing pyruvic acid, lactic acid, and bovine serum albumin. The percentage of mobile sperm was estimated by observation of at least 200 sperm with a light microscope. Motility of the sperm was categorized as actively swimming, twitching, or nonmotile. Sperm from each epididymis from a given male was counted and analyzed, and the two numbers were averaged. For histopathological analysis, muscle tissue was dissected and either rapidly frozen to −150 °C in liquid nitrogen-chilled isopentane or fixed in phosphate-buffered 10% formalin. Frozen sections were stained with Gomori's modified trichrome stain or subjected to histochemical analysis of cytochrome c oxidase activity and NADH dehydrogenase activity, while fixed sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry with a VDAC3-specific antibody was carried out as described (20Pidoplichko V.I. DeBiasi M. Williams J.T. Dani J.A. Nature. 1997; 390: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The tissues are fixed in 20% formalin for 12 h, dehydrated, impregnated with paraffin, and cut at 5 µm. Sections were placed on “plus” slides. Antigen retrieval was performed by placing the slides in citric acid, pH 6.0 (0.01 m), followed by three 5-min bursts of high microwave heat. Chicken anti-VDAC3 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:20 and placed on the tissues for 48 h at 4 °C. The secondary antibodies were applied using the ABC Elite kit from Vector Labs. DAB was used as the chromogen. For transmission electron microscopy, skeletal muscle samples were placed into 3% glutaraldehyde, prepared as described (21Mierau G.W. Weeks D.A. Hicks M.J. Hum. Pathol. 1998; 29: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and examined in a Phillips electron microscope EM 300. Sperm and testes electron microscopy was carried out in a similar fashion, with the testis and cauda epididymis being placed immediately in fixative. Mitochondrial enzyme activity and electron transport complex activity rates were measured in 600 × g supernatants made from snap frozen skeletal muscle homogenates. NADH dehydrogenase, NADH oxidase, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, succinate-cytochromec reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, and citrate synthase activities were measured as previously described (22Trijbels J.M. Sengers R.C. Ruitenbeek W. Fischer J.C. Bakkeren J.A. Janssen A.J. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1988; 148: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To address the physiologic function of VDAC3 a mutant mouse was generated. The gene targeting strategy is shown in Fig. 1. Correct targeting was predicted to delete the last four exons that encode the majority of the protein. VDAC3 heterozygous mice were identified and mated, generating offspring in the expected Mendelian ratio of 1:2:1, indicating that embryogenesis is unaffected by loss of VDAC3. Northern blot analysis of various tissues demonstrates that the VDAC3(−/−) mice do not produce detectable levels of VDAC3 mRNA (Fig.1B). Using a VDAC3-specific antibody, Western blotting did not detect any VDAC3 protein in VDAC3(−/−) animals (Fig.2, A and C). These results demonstrate the complete loss of VDAC3 protein in these mice. VDAC3 appears to be expressed in all testicular cell types (Fig.3), although staining of Leydig cells appears variable (Fig. 3, E and F), perhaps due to nonspecific staining at the edge of the tissue section. While it has been reported that VDACs may localize to extramitochondrial sites (23Shoshan-Barmatz V. Hadad N. Feng W. Shafir I. Orr I. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer L.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,24Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), fractionation of wild type testicular tissues into mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial fractions demonstrates that VDAC3 localizes primarily to mitochondria (Fig. 2B). This result is consistent with our previous cell transfection experiments that showed VDAC3 or its splice variant have a uniquely mitochondrial localization (13Sampson M.J. Ross L. Decker W.K. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30482-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, since germ cell mitochondria differ considerably from those of somatic tissues, the relevance of tissue culture results to germ cell protein targeting remains to be established. In addition, the nuclear fraction was not examined, and since it may contain large cytoskeletal elements, it remains possible that some fraction of VDAC3 may localize to nonmitochondrial sites.Figure 2VDAC3 localizes to mitochondria. Thetop panel shows a Western blot of mitochondrial pellets from muscle (lanes 1 and 2), liver (lanes 3 and 4), and brain (lanes 5 and 6) obtained from VDAC3(+/+) (lanes 1, 3, and5) and VDAC3(−/−) (lanes 2,4, and 6) mice. In the middle panel, fractionation by centrifugation of wild type testes extracts into a mitochondrial (M) and nonmitochondrial (C) extract demonstrates that VDAC3 co-purifies with the mitochondrial fraction, while an antitubulin antibody was used as a control for cytoplasmic contamination. The bottom panel shows the Western analysis of testes VDAC3 protein from mitochondrial pellets of wild type (lane 1) and VDAC3-deficient (lane 2) mice, confirming the complete loss of VDAC3 protein. VDAC1-specific antibody is used to demonstrate the presence of mitochondrial outer membranes in both lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Immunohistochemical localization of VDAC3 protein in a wild type mouse testes.

When homozygous null VDAC3 females were mated with wild type or VDAC3 heterozygous males, normal sized litters were produced. VDAC3(−/−) males showed normal numbers of sperm per epididymis when compared with wild type and VDAC3(+/−) males (TableI). In addition, no significant differences were found in the size, weight, or histologic features of testes between the three groups. To determine whether the absence of VDAC3 leads to enhanced apoptosis, the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay was carried out on testicular histologic sections. The level of apoptosis was comparable between wild type and VDAC3(−/−) animals (data not shown).Table IComparison of VDAC3(+/+), VDAC3(+/−), and VDAC3(−/−) sperm counts and percentage absolute motilityGenotypenWt/WbSperm count (×106)Sperm motility%%VDAC3(+/+)50.153 ± 0.05220.5 ± 6.863.9 ± 5.3VDAC3(+/−)50.162 ± 0.03816.7 ± 5.866.0 ± 7.1VDAC3(−/−)80.142 ± 0.04521.3 ± 9.917.2 ± 4.4Males were sacrificed at 10 weeks, and testes weight (Wt) was compared with total body (Wb). n = number of animals. Open table in a new tab Males were sacrificed at 10 weeks, and testes weight (Wt) was compared with total body (Wb). n = number of animals. There was no distinguishable difference in the motility of wild type and VDAC3(+/−) sperm. In these groups, ∼70% of the sperm were categorized as motile, with half of those actively swimming and the remainder twitching. 17% of VDAC3(−/−) sperm were categorized as motile (Table I; p < 0.001versus wild type), with only 3% of the sperm actively swimming. Sperm motility was also examined over a 1-h time frame (25Fraser L.R. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1992; 116: 345-350PubMed Google Scholar), and no appreciable change in activity over time was observed. Incubation with a variety of energy substrates such as lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, succinate, or malate failed to improve motility. Capacitation was not examined, nor was response to glucose in the incubation media. When viewed by electron microscopy, 68% of VDAC3(−/−) epididymal sperm axonemes (247/362) in cross-section demonstrated some structural aberration, most commonly loss of one outer doublet from the normal 9 + 2 microtubule doublet arrangement. This compared with structural abnormalities in 9% of wild type axonemes (37/423). Axonemes can be oriented by bisecting the axoneme through the longitudinal columns and two associated microtubules (doublets 3 and 8), with three doublets on one side and four on the other side (26Linck R.W. Fawcett D.W. Bedford J.M. The Spermatozoon: Maturation, Motility, Surface Properties, and Comparative Aspects. Urban and Schwarzenberg, Baltimore1979: 99-115Google Scholar). In the majority of abnormal VDAC3(−/−) axonemes, the missing doublet corresponds to the last of the four doublets (doublet 7) (see Fig.4A, top panels, and Fig. 5,A–F), reflecting a single recurring defect in the axonemal structure. Images through the midpiece of epididymal sperm demonstrate the same defect in doublet 7 (Fig. 5), while some images appear to represent intermediate steps in doublet loss (e.g.Fig. 5, A, D, and F), with the missing doublet losing the normal positional relationship to other doublets and the outer dense fibers. The associated outer dense fiber of a missing doublet was often also found to be missing. Electron microscopy of spermatids in the testes revealed enlarged and abnormally shaped mitochondria along the midpiece (Fig. 4A, lower panels). Cross-sections through the distal principal piece of testicular sperm rarely revealed structural abnormalities (Fig.5C), suggesting that the structural abnormality found in epididymal sperm represents instability of the axoneme and not necessarily a defect in assembly. Other less frequently observed structural defects in the axoneme include ectopically placed doublets (Fig. 5A), partial axonemal duplications (Fig.5D), and the absence of half of the doublets (Fig.5D).Figure 5Axonemal defects appear to be due to instability. Shown are electron micrographs of the midpiece of epididymal sperm of VDAC3(−/−) (× 13,000) mice (A,B, E, D, and F).A appears to show a sperm in the process of losing the microtubule doublet (arrow), while F appears slightly earlier in the process, with the outer dense fiber still associated with the doublet. Sectioning through the principal piece of testicular sperm (C) demonstrates only a single abnormal axoneme (arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to the ultrastructural abnormalities observed in sperm axonemes, cilia from tracheal epithelia have a normal 9 + 2 structural arrangement (Fig. 4B) and normal ciliary movement when examined by dark field microscopy. However, when sections were dissected 2 mm below the vocal cords and examined by scanning electron microscopy, there consistently appeared to be reduced numbers of ciliated cells (Fig. 4B), although no increase in respiratory pathology has been seen in the mice. Since VDAC3 undergoes alternative RNA splicing in brain and muscle (13Sampson M.J. Ross L. Decker W.K. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30482-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Anflous K. Blondel O. Bernard A. Khrestchatisky M. Ventura-Clapier R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), skeletal muscle was examined histologically and biochemically for abnormalities. By hematoxylin/eosin staining of muscle cross-sections, no abnormalities in fiber structure or size were seen. Histochemical analysis of frozen sections does not reveal any significant changes in NADH dehydrogenase or cytochrome c oxidase activities, and no increase in ragged red fibers was observed (data not shown). Although no mitochondrial proliferation was seen and citrate synthase activity was not increased, electron microscopy did show unusually shaped mitochondria in skeletal muscle, with both variably enlarged size and extended intermyofibrillar growth (Fig.6A). Respiratory chain activity in skeletal muscle mitochondrial preparations revealed significant reductions in the activity of succinate-cytochromec reductase (complex II/III), ubiquinol-cytochromec reductase (complex III) and NADH oxidase (complex I/IV) (Fig. 6B), while cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) was reduced but not to a level that reached statistical significance (p = 0.085). Citrate synthase activity was unchanged, suggesting an absence of mitochondrial proliferation that commonly occurs in response to respiratory chain defects. No difference in blood lactate concentration was detected (data not shown). The basis for this reduction in respiratory chain activity is unknown, but it implies some functional interaction between the outer and inner membrane components. Whether this is due to alterations in metabolite exchange or perturbation of a macromolecular complex such as that reported at the contact points between the mitochondrial membranes, where VDACs purportedly complex with the adenine nucleotide translocator (3Brdiczka D. Beutner G. Ruck A. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Biofactors. 1998; 8: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), remains to be determined. The mitochondrial outer membrane has historically been viewed as a constitutively permeable membrane, with the inner membrane being the site of regulated transport of metabolites involved in coupled respiration. It is becoming increasingly clear that the outer membrane potentially constitutes an additional site of regulation via control of metabolite flux. The outer membrane also functions as a docking site for cellular kinases, along with being an important site of apoptotic signaling. A key aspect in this latter process may be the closure of VDACs in response to as yet unknown signals. While VDACs can adopt multiple conductance states in vitro, it has not yet been established that VDACs can change conductance states in vivo. Although VDACs are highly conserved across species, the specific function of each isoform remains unknown. It was recently reported that, when singularly expressed in yeast lacking the endogenous VDAC (por1), each isoform confers different permeability properties to the outer mitochondrial membrane. When incorporated into artificial bilayers, each isoform also exhibits electrophysiological differences, with VDAC3 showing the least voltage dependence and the lowest conductance (16Xu X. Decker W. Sampson M.J. Craigen W.J. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the absence of VDAC3 in the mouse leads to at least two abnormalities: defective axonemal structures in sperm and perturbed oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle. Defects in the respiratory chain are consistent with our previous results in VDAC3-deficient cultured cells, in which oxygen consumption in both coupled and uncoupled mitochondria was reduced (27Wu S. Sampson M.J. Decker W.K. Craigen W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We speculate that abnormal respiratory chain activity in part reflects disturbance of metabolite flux, but other possibilities, such as altered kinase binding or perturbations in mitochondrial-cytoskeletal interactions, require investigation. In this regard, mitochondrially bound hexokinase type 1 activity in brain extracts, which is typically 65–70% of total hexokinase activity, is unchanged from control values in the absence of VDAC3 (data not shown), but the subcellular localization of other kinases known to bind mitochondria has not yet been addressed. The appearance of mitochondria with abnormal size and shape suggests altered cytoarchitecture, and it has been previously reported that VDACs interact with the microtubule-associated protein MAP2 (28Linden M. Nelson B.D. Loncar D. Leterrier J.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Linden M. Karlsson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The respiratory chain assays were performed on previously frozen samples; hence, the observed defects should not simply reflect substrate flux at the time of assay, since the outer membrane is disrupted by freezing. Thus, less dynamic and more long lasting alterations in the respiratory chain must occur to account for these results. The respiratory complex defects are reminiscent of the loss of cytochrome c oxidase activity in yeast lackingpor1 (30Dihanich M. Suda K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Use of fresh skinned muscle fibers should allow for the direct measurement of outer membrane permeability in intact preparations. VDAC3 is also necessary for the maintenance of ciliary structures. Interestingly, this role appears limited to axonemes of sperm and not those of tracheal airway cilia, while cilia of the inner ear have not yet been examined. This differential effect on sperm and airway cilia has previously been recognized clinically in infertile men (31Escudier E. Escalier D. Pinchon M.C. Boucherat M. Bernaudin J.F. Fleury-Feith J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 142: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Infertility affects as many as 5–10% of men (32Dessars B. Cochaux P. Rev. Med. Brux. 1999; 20: A457-A462PubMed Google Scholar), making it one of the most common disorders in humans. Sperm motility is one of the major determinants of fertility in men, and poor sperm motility is a major cause of male infertility (33Martin-Du Pan R.C. Bischof P. Campana A. Morabia A. Arch. Androl. 1997; 39: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the case of VDAC3-deficient mice, the normal structures found in spermatids within the testes suggest that the defect develops with maturation of sperm in the transition from the testes to the epididymis. Each microtubule doublet has a corresponding outer dense fiber, all of which are morphologically distinguishable. Two of the outer dense fibers that are associated with microtubules 3 and 8 terminate within the principal piece and form the longitudinal columns of the fibrous sheath that partition the axoneme into two unequal compartments. It has been proposed that loss of doublets 4–7 represent sliding of microtubules during attempted motility, with extrusion of half of the axoneme (35Merlino G.T. Stahle C. Jhappan C. Linton R. Mahon K.A. Willingham M.C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although, based on the results presented here, expression of VDAC3 protein appears ubiquitous, VDAC1 and VDAC2 reportedly are expressed in a more limited fashion, with VDAC1 restricted to Sertoli cells and VDAC2 found in secondary spermatocytes and in round and elongated spermatids (36Hinsch K.D. Elvira Hinsch A. Konrad L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These differences in cell type expression imply distinct isoform-specific functions for the VDACs in gonadal cell lineages. Thus, VDAC3-deficient male mice represent a novel model of sperm immotility due to a mitochondrial defect and demonstrate that functional mitochondria are required for the structural maintenance of the axoneme. The defect in skeletal muscle respiratory chain complex activity suggests the possibility of a similar deficiency in sperm mitochondria, but how this would relate to axonemal stability is not clear. Recently, Jonas et al. (34Jonas E.A. Buchanan J. Kaczmarek L.K. Science. 1999; 286: 1347-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have reported that patch clamp recordings from presynaptic mitochondria detect a rapid increase in large conductances (0.5–2.5 nanosiemens) following a series of action potentials. This conductance depended on the presence of extracellular calcium, and they speculated that conductance reflected activation of mitochondrial outer membrane VDACs. Since the change in conductance outlasted the input stimulus in a time frame very similar to that seen in post-tetanic long term potentiation, the authors further proposed that mitochondrial conductance contributes to synaptic plasticity. Studies are currently under way to address this issue. We thank Bobbie Antalffy and Jim Barrish for technical assistance."

The large number of reported tetraspanin-associated proteins raises critical questions about complex size, specificity, and functional relevance. These concerns may be addressed by evaluating tetraspanin complexes with respect to four criteria: detergent stability, specificity, proximity, and stoichiometry. For example, CD151-α3β1 integrin complexes are stable in conditions (Triton X-100 plus SDS detergent) that disrupt all other known tetraspanin associations, and at least 90% of α3β1 is associated with CD151 under these conditions (26Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Covalent cross-linking of CD151 to α3integrin confirmed that CD151 and α3 integrin are directly associated (27Yauch R.L. Kazarov A.R. Desai B. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9230-9238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD151 participation in α3β1-mediated neurite outgrowth and growth cone motility points to a specific functional relationship between CD151 and α3β1 integrin (28Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1871-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To observe many other tetraspanin complexes, detergents less disruptive than Triton X-100 are required. We often utilize the moderately stringent Brij 96/97 detergent because (i) tetraspanin complexes in Brij 96 have a discrete size (significantly less than 4-million Da (29Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,30Stipp C.S. Orlicky D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4853-4862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas milder detergents such as CHAPS may yield tetraspanin complexes in excess of 10-million Da (31Skubitz K.M. Campbell K.D. Skubitz A.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); (ii) tetraspanin complexes in Brij 96 are fully soluble and do not depend on poorly solubilized low density vesicular membrane microdomains for their stability (29Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,30Stipp C.S. Orlicky D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4853-4862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); (iii) tetraspanin complexes with distinct protein compositions can be readily solubilized in Brij 96 (30); and (iv) tetraspanin associations observed in Brij 96 have typically proven to be functionally relevant. For example, CD81 contributes to α3β1-mediated neurite outgrowth (28Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1871-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to signaling through CD19 (23Horvath G.

Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10844-10849Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The tetraspanin CD81 is expressed by virtually every cell type tested, whereas CD9 is more restricted. As seen from co-expression in at least one cell type, the majority of CD9 may be in a complex with CD81. Consistent with this, in Brij 96 lysates, CD81 and CD9 complexes (with other proteins) appear strikingly similar but distinct from other tetraspanin complexes (30Stipp C.S. Orlicky D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4853-4862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Whereas CD9 plays an essential role in sperm-egg fusion during fertilization (33Miyado K.

Despite the large body of evidence linking CD9 and CD81 to a wide range of developmental and pathogenic processes, no central organizing hypothesis has emerged to explain CD9 and CD81 functions. By identifying major protein partners that are specific, highly proximal, and highly stoichiometric, we hope to gain insight into the functions of CD9 and CD81 in disease and development. To this end, we have used a mass spectrometry protein sequencing approach to identify proteins that co-purify with CD81 from Brij 96 lysates. Here we describe a novel Ig superfamily protein, EWI-2, that associates with CD81 and CD9 with high specificity, stoichiometry, and proximity. Among the many reported partners for CD9 and CD81, only one other molecule (FPRP, CD9P-1) appears to have a level of specificity, stoichiometry, and proximity comparable with that seen here for EWI-2 (30Stipp C.S.

Remarkably, that FPRP/CD9P-1 molecule (here renamed EWI-F) belongs to the same novel subfamily of IgSF proteins as our newly discovered EWI-2 molecule. Anti-integrin mAbs used in this study were anti-α2, A2-IIE10 (64Bergelson J.M. St J.N. Kawaguchi S. Pasqualini R. Berdichevsky F. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Cell Adhes.

The M2 anti-FLAG epitope mAb, either biotinylated or conjugated to agarose, was purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat-anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Fc-specific) and non-immune mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma. Anti-β1 integrin TS2/16 and non-immune mouse IgG were conjugated to agarose Affi-Gel-10 (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. A431 epithelial carcinoma cells, NT2 teratocarcinoma cells, and 293 embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. To obtain NT2RA cells, NT2 cells were treated with 10 µm retinoic acid for 4–5 weeks, split 1:6 into fresh flasks, and then treated for 10–14 days with mitotic inhibitors (69Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M. J Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD81-associated proteins were prepared as previously described (30Stipp C.S. Orlicky D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4853-4862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, CD81 complexes were affinity-purified from a Brij 96 lysate of NT2RA cells using anti-CD81 mAb JS64 and protein G-Sepharose. CD81-associated proteins were eluted in 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, concentrated by Microcon (COSTAR), and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Silver-stained bands migrating at ∼70 kDa were excised, rinsed with 50% HPLC-grade acetonitrile, and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Silver-stained bands were next subjected to in gel reduction, carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion (Promega). As previously described (30Stipp C.S. Orlicky D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4853-4862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), peptide sequences were determined by microcapillary reverse-phase chromatography directly coupled to a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a custom nanoelectrospray source. Interpretation of the resulting tandem mass spectroscopy spectra of the peptides was facilitated by programs developed in the Harvard Microchemistry Facility and by data base correlation with the algorithm Sequest (70Chittum H.S.

The cDNA clone used for the polymerase chain reaction (GenBankTM accession number AI700165) contained an intron that was removed by recombinant polymerase chain reaction. Primers for amplifying the N-terminal exon were: sense, 5′-GATATCGTCGACCCACGCG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CCAGCACCACACCTTCCTCCCGCACATGTAGAGG-3′. Primers for amplifying the C-terminal exon were: sense, 5′-GTGCGGGAGGAAGGTGTGGTGCTGGAGGCTGTG-3′; and antisense, 5′-GGAATTCCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCCCGTTTTCGAAGCCTCTT- CATG-3′. The recombinant polymerase chain reaction product was digested withSalI and EcoRI and cloned intoSalI/EcoRI I sites of the pLXIZ retroviral vector. The resulting retroviral expression construct was transfected by the calcium phosphate method into ΦNX-packaging cells. 48 h after transfection, the ΦNX cell supernatant was passed through a 0.45-µm filter, supplemented with 4 µg/ml Polybrene (Sigma), and used to infect 293 cells. Stable EWI-2-expressing cells were obtained by selection for 2 weeks in 100 µg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). The resulting cells, 293-EWI-2 cells, were maintained in 100 µg/ml zeocin as polyclonal population. A multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with EWI-2 or β-actin probes using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EWI-2 probe was prepared by digestion of pLXIZ-EWI-2 construct with BstXI and gel purification of a 0.9-kilobase 3′-fragment of EWI-2 open reading frame. Radioactive probes were generated by random priming with Prime It II kit (Stratagene) with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were biotinylated with 0.2 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC biotin (Pierce) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2 (HBSM) for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 rinses with HBSM, cells were lysed by scraping into 1% Brij 96 (Fluka) or 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in HBSM with 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Sigma), 20 µg/ml aprotinin, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After a 1-h extraction at 4 °C with rocking, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Specific antibodies were added along with protein G-Sepharose, and immune complexes were collected overnight at 4 °C. Alternatively, lysates were precleared with non-immune mouse IgG coupled to agarose before immunoprecipitation with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads. After rinsing four times with lysis buffer, immune complexes were eluted by boiling in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). After rinsing with PBST, blots were developed and visualized using HRP-extravidin (Sigma) followed by chemiluminescence detection (Renaissance reagent, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For CD81 immunoblotting, immunoprecipitates prepared as above were separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking with 5% milk in PBST, the blots were developed with the M38 anti-CD81 mAb (2 µg/ml) followed by HRP-goat-anti-mouse-IgG and chemiluminescence. FLAG epitope immunoblots were prepared and blocked as above, rinsed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and blotted for 30 min with biotinylated M2 anti-FLAG mAb. After 10 rinses, blots were developed with a 30-min exposure to HRP-extravidin followed by 10 more rinses and chemiluminescence detection. For immunodepletion, 293-EWI-2 cells were cell surface-biotinylated and lysed in 1% Brij 96 as described above. The lysate was divided into 3 parts and passed 7 times over 0.4-ml columns of mouse Ig-agarose, M2 anti-FLAG agarose, or TS2/16 agarose poured in 1-ml syringe barrels. The depleted samples were divided into four parts each, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as above. 1% Brij 96 extracts of 293-EWI-2 cells were clarified by two rounds of centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min and then treated with the indicated concentrations of the cross-linkers dithiobismaleimidoethane or dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. DSP reactions were quenched by reacting for 15 min at room temperature with 10 mm glycine, pH 7.5. Triton X-100 was added to 1% to cross-linked lysates and a portion of the non-cross-linked control lysates, and samples were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as described above. Cell surface biotinylated 293 cells were lysed in 1% Brij 96 as above. Lysate-containing ∼1 × 107cell equivalents was loaded in 5% glycerol with blue dextran and phenol red to a 25.5 × 1.0-cm Sepharose 6B column that had been pre-equilibrated in 1% Brij 96 in HBSM at room temperature (Brij 96 solutions cloud upon prolonged storage at 4 °C). 22 fractions of ∼540 µl were collected spanning from the leading edge of the blue dextran elution to the phenol red elution point. 400 µl of fraction 11 from this column was mixed with 400 µl of 90% sucrose, 1% Brij 96 in HBSM loaded over a 0.5-ml cushion of 50% sucrose and overlaid with layers of 40% sucrose (1.5 ml), 20% sucrose (1.5 ml), and 5% sucrose (0.7 ml) prepared in HBSM without detergent. After centrifugation for 21 h at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman SWTi55 rotor at 4 °C, 14 fractions of 360 µl were collected from the top of the gradient. The pellet was included in the final fraction. 1 ml of 1.36% Brij 96 in HBSM was added to each fraction, and CD81 complexes were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by blotting with extravidin-HRP, as described above. Elsewhere we have established methodology for isolation of specific CD81-associated proteins from 1% Brij 96 detergent lysates.

CD81 complexes isolated from cell surface-labeled NT2RA cells (Fig.1, lane A), 293 embryonic kidney cells (Fig. 1, lane B), and A431 epithelial carcinoma cells (Fig. 1, lane C) contained CD9 (∼30 kDa) as well as major species migrating above 120 kDa. These were previously identified as a mixture of α3β1 integrin and a novel Ig superfamily protein (FPRP, CD9P-1 (30Stipp C.S. Orlicky D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol.

To identity the CD81-associated p70 protein, CD81 complexes were affinity-purified from a Brij 96 lysate of NT2RA cells and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The 70-kDa band was excised after silver-staining and digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase liquid chromatography and sequenced by ion trap tandem mass spectroscopy. A few of the peptides obtained (from actin, keratin, and heat shock proteins) are commonly observed in sensitive mass spectroscopy-sequencing protocols. A few other peptides corresponded to proteins for which CD81 association could not be confirmed. 2C. Stipp and M. Hemler, unpublished data. By far the most well represented species was a protein for which 13 peptides were obtained. These peptides were initially sorted into six groups based on overlap with distinct ESTs (Table I). The first five peptides in Table I clustered to an EST (GenBankTM accession AI336860) described as “similar to a leukocyte surface antigen.” The UniGene tool (National Center for Biotechnology) revealed several large, known cDNA clones in this cluster. Sequencing of one clone (GenBankTM accessionAI700165) revealed an insert of ∼2.7 kilobases with an ATG start codon conforming to the Kozak consensus (72Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar), 1312 base pairs of coding sequence, a 228-base pair intron, and an additional 527 base pairs of coding region beyond the intron. Peptide 9 in Table I contained sequences on both sides of this intron. A second cDNA (GenBankTMAI35696"

In this study, we examined the cellular mechanisms responsible for Fas-independent, bile acid-mediated apoptosis. HuH-7 cells, which are known to be Fas deficient, were stably transfected with the sodium-dependent bile acid transporting polypeptide. The toxic bile acid glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC)-induced apoptosis in these cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Apoptosis and mitochondrial cytochrome c release were inhibited by transfection with dominant negative FADD, CrmA transfection, or treatment with the selective caspase 8 inhibitor IETD-CHO. These observations suggested the Fas-independent apoptosis was also death receptor mediated. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated tumor necrosis factor-R1, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-R1/DR4, -R2/DR5, and TRAIL, but not tumor necrosis fator-α expression by these cells. GCDC treatment increased expression of TRAIL-R2/DR5 mRNA and protein 10-fold while expression of TRAIL-R1 was unchanged. Furthermore, aggregation of TRAIL-R2/DR5, but not TRAIL-R1/DR4 was observed following GCDC treatment of the cells. Induction of TRAIL-R2/DR5 expression and apoptosis by bile acids provides new insights into the mechanisms of hepatocyte apoptosis and the regulation of TRAIL-R2/DR5 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1984461083,"Stabilization and overexpression are hallmarks of mutant p53 found in nearly 50% of human tumors. Mutations in the conformation-sensitive core domain of p53 often lead to association with molecular chaperones such as hsp70 and hsp90. Inhibition of hsp90 function accelerates mutant p53 degradation. We recently found that expression of p53 core domain mutants inhibits MDM2 degradation, suggesting that mutant p53 can modulate MDM2 functions. In this report, we show that mutant p53 mediates formation of MDM2-p53-hsp90 complexes. Release of MDM2 from the p53-hsp90 complex after DNA damage restores MDM2 but not p53 turnover, whereas dissociation of hsp90 by geldanamycin increases the degradation of both MDM2 and mutant p53. Mutant p53 degradation after hsp90 inhibition requires MDM2 expression. The interaction between MDM2 and hsp90 is disrupted by the 2A10 antibody, which recognizes a site on MDM2 important for binding to alternative reading frame (ARF). Expression of mutant p53 prevents MDM2 from binding ARF and accumulating in the nucleolus in an hsp90-dependent fashion. These results suggest that hsp90 recruited by mutant p53 conceals the ARF-binding site on MDM2 and inhibits its ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase function, resulting in the stabilization of both mutant p53 and MDM2."
https://openalex.org/W2057525817,"Activation of phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCγ2) is the critical step in B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-coupled calcium signaling. Although genetic dissection experiments on B cells have demonstrated that Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and Syk are required for activating PLCγ2, the exact activation mechanism of PLCγ2 by these kinases has not been established. We identify the tyrosine residues 753, 759, 1197, and 1217 in rat PLCγ2 as Btk-dependent phosphorylation sites by using an in vitro kinase assay. To evaluate the role of these tyrosine residues in phosphorylation-dependent activation of PLCγ2, PLCγ2-deficient DT40 cells were reconstituted with a series of mutant PLCγ2s in which the phenylalanine was substituted for tyrosine. Substitution of all four tyrosine residues almost completely eliminated the BCR-induced PLCγ2 phosphorylation, indicating that these residues include the major phosphorylation sites upon BCR engagement. Cells expressing PLCγ2 with a single substitution exhibited some extent of reduction in calcium mobilization, whereas those expressing quadruple mutant PLCγ2 showed greatly reduced calcium response. These findings indicate that the phosphorylations of the tyrosine residues 753, 759, 1197, and 1217, which have been identified as Btk-dependent phosphorylation sites in vitro, coordinately contribute to BCR-induced activation of PLCγ2.

The earliest known event is the activation of the following three distinct types of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs): Src-PTK (such as Lyn), Syk, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). The activation of these PTKs subsequently leads to the initiation of calcium signaling, i.e. the intracellular calcium mobilization and entry of extracellular calcium that regulate the selectivity of a variety of transcription factors (4Berridge M.J.

In B cells, phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCγ2) plays a dominant role in triggering the BCR-induced calcium signaling by producing the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) which binds to IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently makes the release of the internal store of calcium possible (6Coggeshall K.M.

The proposed molecular connection (25Kurosaki T. Tsukada S. Immunity. 2000; 12: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is that, after BCR cross-linking, Syk is activated and subsequently phosphorylates BLNK, which allows for the association of Btk with BLNK (21Hashimoto S.

The next question to be clarified is how PLCγ2 is activated through its tyrosine phosphorylation by these two PTKs. Although the number of molecules identified as the substrate of Btk is very limited (29Baba Y. Nonoyama S. Matsushita M. Yamadori T. Hashimoto S. Imai K. Arai S. Kunikata T. Kurimoto M. Kurosaki T. Ochs H.D. Yata J. Kishimoto T. Tsukada S. Blood. 1999; 93: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), heterogeneous transfection experiments have demonstrated that coexpression of Btk and PLCγ2 in NIH3T3 cells or 293T cells results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 (20Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 21Hashimoto S.

Blood. 1999; 94: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that PLCγ2 is the direct substrate of Btk. Although the reduction of PLCγ2 phosphorylation in Btk-deficient B cells is relatively small as compared with that in Syk-deficient B cells, the former also show almost complete loss of IP3 production and calcium mobilization (16Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 17Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the Btk-dependent PLCγ2 phosphorylation is critical for initiating calcium signaling in B cells and that the residual PLCγ2 phosphorylation in Btk-deficient cells, which is presumably caused by Syk or other PTK(s), is not sufficient for PLCγ2 activation. In the study presented here, we investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 by Btk. Determination of the Btk-dependent phosphorylation sites in PLCγ2 enabled us to evaluate the role of these tyrosine residues in BCR-induced PLCγ2 activation, which results in the initiation of calcium signaling. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.

Immunoprecipitates with anti-Btk mAb 48-2H from transfected 293T cell lysates were washed twice with kinase buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 20 mmMnCl2). 50 µl of kinase buffer, 1 µg of indicated GST proteins, and [γ-32P]ATP (10 µCi) were added to each sample. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 10 min and then terminated by adding the sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Autophosphorylation of Btk and transphosphorylation of GST proteins were detected with autoradiography (29Baba Y. Nonoyama S. Matsushita M. Yamadori T. Hashimoto S. Imai K. Arai S. Kunikata T.

For the assay of phospholipase activity from DT40 cells stimulated with M4 (4 µg/ml) or 0.5 mm pervanadate, we used PLC assay buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) Triton X (11Nishibe S. Wahl M.I.

The reaction mixture was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid and bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation, radioactivity in the supernatant was measured. DT40 cells (3 × 107) were stimulated with anti-chicken IgM mAb M4 (4 µg/ml) at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 143 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium vanadate supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin)). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-T7 mAb conjugated to protein-A Sepharose and then analyzed by means of immunoblotting as described previously (29Baba Y. Nonoyama S. Matsushita M. Yamadori T.

Cells were washed twice and adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml. Emission at 510 nm was monitored under excitation of the cell suspension at two different wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model RF-1500; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 37 °C. Calibration and calculation of calcium levels were performed as described elsewhere (33Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106) suspended in 50 µl of culture medium were stimulated with mAb M4 (2 µg/50 µl) at 37 °C for the indicated times. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 µl of ice-cold 15% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, supernatants were washed four times with 1 ml of water-saturated diethyl ether. Kinetic analysis of IP3 production from cells (2 × 106) was performed with the BIOTRAK IP3 assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To identify the sites of Btk-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in PLCγ2, GST fusion protein series that covers the whole sequence of rat PLCγ2 (Fig.1A) was constructed. As the source of purified Btk protein, Btk cDNA was transfected into 293T cells, and expressed Btk protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Btk mAb. In vitro kinase assay was then carried out with each of the GST-PLCγ2 fusion proteins as the potential substrate (Fig.1B shows representative cases). Prominent transphosphorylation of the GST fusion proteins by Btk was observed only when the GST fusion proteins carrying the residues in the linker region between the SH2 and SH3 domains (the minimum sequence is 639–770) or in the carboxyl-terminal region (the minimum sequences are 1141–1212 and 1200–1244) of PLCγ2 were used for the assay (Fig.1A). Because phosphorylation of the GST fusion proteins was not observed when kinase-inactive Btk (Btk(K−)) was used for thein vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2,2nd lane), phosphorylation did not depend on the activities of other kinases that might be contaminated in the immunoprecipitate. The sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in PLCγ2 were further determined by using GST constructs with phenylalanine substituted for tyrosine. The sequence 639–770 in PLCγ2 contains 11 tyrosine residues. The sequence in this region of PLCγ2 exhibits a certain homology with that of PLCγ1 (14Carpenter G. Ji Q. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 15Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 55Noh D.Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Based on the previous finding that the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in PLCγ1 are residues 771 and 783 (34Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), we decided to mutate the tyrosine residues 753 and 759 in PLCγ2. The GST fusion protein with a double mutant, Y753F/Y759F, in which tyrosine residues 753 and 759 were simultaneously changed to phenylalanine, was also examined. The two sequences in the carboxyl-terminal region (1141–1212 and 1200–1244) of PLCγ2 have no homology with that of PLCγ1 (14Carpenter G. Ji Q. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 15Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The sequence 1141–1212 contains three tyrosine residues (1153, 1171, and 1197), whereas only one tyrosine residue (1217) is found in the sequence 1200–1244. These tyrosine residues were sequentially substituted by phenylalanine. As shown in Fig. 2A, the Y753F substitution in GST-PLCγ2-(639–770) greatly reduced the phosphorylation when compared with that of the non-substituted GST fusion protein, whereas the extent of phosphorylation in the GST protein carrying the Y759F substitution was hardly distinguishable from that in the non-substituted protein. However, in contrast to the observation that phosphorylation in the Y753F mutant was still detectable, the phosphorylation was completely eliminated when the Y753F/Y759F double mutant was subjected to the same assay. These findings indicated that both the tyrosine residues 753 and 759 are Btk-dependent phosphorylation sites. With the same procedure, the residues 1197 in the GST-PLCγ2-(1141–1212) protein (Fig. 2B) and 1217 in the GST-PLCγ2-(1200–1244) protein (Fig. 2C) were identified as Btk-dependent phosphorylation sites. The confirmed sites of Btk-dependent phosphorylation in PLCγ2 are thus tyrosine residues 753 and 759, which fall in the linker region between the SH2 and SH3 domains, and 1197 and 1217, which are located in the carboxyl-terminal region (Fig. 3). These four tyrosine residues in rat PLCγ2 are also conserved in human PLCγ2.Figure 2Identification of tyrosine phosphorylation sites of PLCγ2 by Btk. A, GST fusion protein with the amino acid sequence corresponding to 639–770 of PLCγ2 (WT) was phosphorylated by wild-type Btk in thein vitro kinase assay (top panel, 1st lane), whereas no phosphorylation was detected with Btk(K−) (2nd lane). The substitution of phenylalanine for Tyr-753 (Y753F) resulted in a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of the GST fusion protein (3rd lane). Although the substitution of phenylalanine for Tyr-759 (Y759F) did not make a significant difference in the phosphorylation from the WT protein (4th lane), the double mutant (Y753F/Y759F) protein showed no phosphorylation (5th lane). The 2nd panel shows an equal amount of Btk precipitation by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-Btk mAb 43-3B, and an equal amount of GST fusion proteins are shown by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining in the 3rd panel. Arrows and arrowheads indicate Btk and GST fusion proteins, respectively. B, GST fusion protein with the amino acid sequence corresponding to 1141–1212 of PLCγ2 (WT) was phosphorylated by Btk (top panel, 1st lane), and the phosphorylation was eliminated by the substitution of Btk(K−) for Btk (2nd lane) or of the Y1197F mutant protein for the WT GST fusion protein (3rd lane). C, GST fusion protein with the amino acid sequence corresponding to 1200–1244 of PLCγ2 (WT) was phosphorylated by Btk (1st lane), whereas the phosphorylation was eliminated by Btk(K−) (2nd lane) or Y1217F mutant (3rd lane) substitution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Wild-type and mutant PLCγ2 expression constructs.

Wild-type or a series of mutant PLCγ2s tagged with the T7 sequence (Fig. 3) were expressed with Btk in 293T cells (Fig.4). The quadruple mutant, Y-4F, in which tyrosine residues 753, 759, 1197, and 1217 were simultaneously substituted by phenylalanine, was also examined. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 mAb, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of each type of PLCγ2 was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4, PLCγ2 with Y753F, Y1197F, or Y1217F substitution exhibited a lesser extent of tyrosine phosphorylation than did wild-type PLCγ2. Strikingly, the Btk-dependent phosphorylation of the Y-4F mutant was greatly reduced despite a similar level of protein expression. Although the phosphorylation level of single mutant PLCγ2 in the reconstituted cells exhibited a different pattern from that in DT40 cells (see below), these results indicated that the major sites of Btk-dependent phosphorylation in PLCγ2 as seen in thein vitro kinase assay and in the coexpression systems were identical. To evaluate the contribution of these four tyrosine residues (753, 759, 1197, and 1217) to BCR-mediated signaling, wild-type or mutant PLCγ2 cDNAs were stably transfected into PLCγ2-deficient DT40 cells. The expression level of mutant PLCγ2 was approximately the same as that of the transfectant with wild-type PLCγ2, which was about three times higher than that of the endogenous chicken PLCγ2 in wild-type DT40 cells (Fig.5A). The in vitroPLC assay for wild-type and mutant PLCγ2 resulted in similar levels of IP3 production (Fig. 5B), indicating that these mutants did not significantly affect the in vitrolipid hydrolyzing activity of PLCγ2 in resting cells. The cell surface expressions of BCR on these cells measured by flow cytometric analysis were essentially the same levels as that on the parental PLCγ2-deficient DT40 cells (data not shown). The global patterns of BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these transfectants, which were assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine blot of the whole cell lysate, were also indistinguishable (data not shown). By using these transfectant cells, the contribution of the four tyrosine residues to BCR-induced PLCγ2 phosphorylation was evaluated (Fig.6A, top panel, arrow). Although the extent of BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in single mutants (Y753F, Y759F, Y1197F, or Y1217F) was indistinguishable from that in wild-type PLCγ2, the double mutant, Y753F/Y759F, exhibited a significant loss of PLCγ2 phosphorylation, whereas the quadruple mutant, Y-4F, showed almost complete loss of BCR-induced PLCγ2 phosphorylation. Although the phosphorylation of Tyr-759in vitro (Fig. 2A) and in reconstituted cells (Fig. 4) appeared to be weak, Tyr-759 proved to be phosphorylated in DT40 cells upon BCR stimulation because Y753F/Y759F showed a significant reduction in PLCγ2 phosphorylation as compared with Y753F. These results indicated that the major sites of BCR-induced PLCγ2 phosphorylation are included in the four tyrosine residues, 753, 759, 1197, and 1217.Figure 6Analysis of BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2, calcium mobilization, and IP3 production in PLCγ2-deficient DT40 cells that ectopically expressed wild-type or mutant PLCγ2.A, before (−) and after (+) stimulation with anti-chicken IgM mAb M4 for 3 min; the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-T7 mAb and immunoblotted (IB) withanti-pTyr mAb (top panel).

It was shown that enzymes from various organisms strictly recognize the elbow region of tRNA formed by the conserved D- and T-loops. However, most of the mammalian mitochondrial (mt) tRNAs lack consensus sequences in both D- and T-loops. To characterize the mammalian mt CCA-adding enzymes, we have partially purified the enzyme from bovine liver mitochondria and determined cDNA sequences from human and mouse dbESTs by mass spectrometric analysis. The identified sequences contained typical amino-terminal peptides for mitochondrial protein import and had characteristics of the class II nucleotidyltransferase superfamily that includes eukaryotic and eubacterial CCA-adding enzymes. The human recombinant enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its CCA-adding activity was characterized using several mt tRNAs as substrates. The results clearly show that the human mt CCA-adding enzyme can efficiently repair mt tRNAs that are poor substrates for the E. coli enzyme although both enzymes work equally well on cytoplasmic tRNAs. This suggests that the mammalian mt enzymes have evolved so as to recognize mt tRNAs with unusual structures.

The CCA terminus of the tRNA molecule is the attachment site for the amino acid, and most of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and elongation factor Tu require this sequence to be present to function (1Liu J.C.

Furthermore, it has been shown that the CCA sequence is necessary for the exact positioning of the peptidyl-tRNA at the P site and aminoacyl-tRNA at the A site on the large ribosomal subunit to facilitate peptide bond formation (4Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 5Samaha R.R. Green R. Noller H.F.

In certain organisms such as eukaryotes, some archaea, and many eubacteria, the tRNA genes do not encode the CCA sequence; therefore its addition is an essential step for tRNA maturation (7Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). CCA-adding enzymes belong to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, which is divided into two classes (8Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). Class I contains the archaeal CCA-adding enzyme and eukaryotic poly(A) polymerases, whereas class II contains eubacterial and eukaryotic CCA-adding enzymes and eubacterial poly(A) polymerases. The class II CCA-adding enzymes exhibit significant homology in the over 25-kDa region including the active site, which commonly has DXD and RRD motifs (8Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar), whereas class I enzymes do not show a significant homology with class II enzymes around the active site. The addition of CCA by the CCA-adding enzymes does not require any nucleic acid template unlike other DNA or RNA polymerases. Several mechanisms for CCA addition have been hypothesized from the results of biochemical experiments (9Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Masiakowski P. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

We proposed the “dead-end AMP incorporation hypothesis” based on the finding that the class II enzymes have significantly high affinity for ATP compared with CTP and that AMP incorporation clearly terminated poly(C) polymerization (12Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Ueda T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The CCA sequence is not encoded on organellar tRNA genes (7Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 13Morl M. Marchfelder A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In mammals, all 22 mitochondrial (mt) tRNA genes present in the mitochondrial genome are encoded without CCA sequences (14Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7644) Google Scholar). After primary transcription, mt tRNAs are cleaved from the precursor RNA, and their CCA termini are synthesized by mt CCA-adding enzyme (15Rossmanith W. Tullo A. Potuschak T. Karwan R. Sbisa E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12885-12891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the CCA-adding enzymes from E. coli, yeast, and Sulfolobus shibatae recognize the elbow region of tRNA formed by D- and T-loops (9Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Li Z. Gillis K.A. Hegg L.A. Zhang J. Thurlow D.L. Biochem.

T-loop sequence is highly conserved in cytoplasmic tRNAs and is supposed to be especially important for CCA addition. In contrast to cytoplasmic tRNAs, the majority of mt tRNAs have no consensus sequences in either T- or D-loops, and some of them lack the entire loops (7Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 18Helm M. Brule H. Friede D. Giege R. Putz D. Florentz C. RNA. 2000; 6: 1356-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, we are intrigued as to how the mt CCA-adding enzyme recognizes mt tRNAs that have no conserved T-loop sequences. Although CCA-adding activity in mitochondria has been detected in various organisms (15Rossmanith W. Tullo A. Potuschak T. Karwan R. Sbisa E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1972; 247: 481-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), purification of the mt CCA-adding enzymes and determination of their amino acid sequences have not yet been reported. The sole exception is the yeast mitochondrial CCA-adding enzyme, which is encoded by the same gene as the cytoplasmic enzyme, but carries an amino-terminal mitochondrial import sequence derived from an alternative start codon (20Chen J.Y. Joyce P.B. Wolfe C.L. Steffen M.C. Martin N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14879-14883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because yeast mt tRNAs have canonical T-loop with conserved sequence, the yeast mt CCA-adding enzyme can be assumed to be similar to the bacterial enzymes in terms of tRNA recognition. To investigate how mammalian mt CCA-adding enzymes recognize mt tRNAs, we have partially purified the enzyme from bovine liver mitochondria and determined cDNA sequences of human and mouse mitochondrial counterparts by mass spectrometric analysis coupled with dbEST search. We have expressed the human mt CCA-adding enzyme in E. colicells and compared its activity with that of the E. coliCCA-adding enzyme using mt tRNAs as the substrate. The results clearly showed that the human mt CCA-adding enzyme efficiently repaired the mt tRNAs whereas the E. coli enzyme had a much lower efficiency, although both enzymes work equally well on cytoplasmic tRNAs. These findings strongly suggest that the mt CCA-adding enzymes have co-evolved with the altered shapes of the mt tRNAs. [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DEAE-Sepharose fast flow, Q-Sepharose fast flow, SP-Sepharose fast flow, and Hi Trap Blue columns were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech, and the Bio-Scale CHT2-I column was purchased from Bio-Rad. Buffer TG contains 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).1 Buffer HG contains 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.0), 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF. Buffer PG contains 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmPMSF. The assays were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in reaction mixtures (10 µl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CTP, 0.1 mm [α-32P]ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.1A 260 unit of substrate RNA, and appropriate amounts of the enzyme fraction. We used a crude yeast tRNA mixture containing 3′-truncated tRNAs and 5 S rRNA obtained from overgrown cell cultures as the substrate for the purification of bovine mt CCA-adding enzyme. The enzyme activity was detected by a gel electrophoresis assay or filter assay. The gel electrophoresis assay was used during the initial steps of enzyme preparation (Steps 2 and 3 (see below)) to distinguish the activity of the CCA-adding enzyme from that of poly(A) polymerase. After the reaction, the tRNA substrate was extracted by phenol from the reaction mixture, mixed with gel-loading solution, and then applied to a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 murea. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to an imaging plate. The radioactivity was analyzed by an image analyzer (BAS-1000, Fuji Photosystem). The filter assay was performed as follows. Aliquots (5 µl) were spotted on a cellulose filter (Whatman No. 3MM) and acid-precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid (10 min), followed by two trichloroacetic acid washes (10 min) and an ethanol wash (5 min). The level of radioactivity in the spots was visualized and quantified by the image analyzer. All procedures were generally performed in a cold room (4 °C). Mitochondria were obtained from a fresh bovine liver following established methods (23Schwartzbach C.J. Farwell M. Liao H.X. Spremulli L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 248-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitoplasts were prepared by digitonin treatment of the mitochondria. Mitochondrial S-100 fraction was prepared as described (23Schwartzbach C.J. Farwell M. Liao H.X. Spremulli L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 248-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fresh S-100 fraction (3000 mg) was applied to an anion exchange column (DEAE-Sepharose fast flow or Q-Sepharose fast flow) equilibrated with Buffer TG containing 30 mm KCl (TG.03) and developed with a linear gradient from 30 to 300 mm KCl in Buffer TG at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Fractions containing CCA-adding activity were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer HG. The pooled fractions were applied to a SP-Sepharose fast flow column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with HG.02 and developed with a linear gradient (20–300 mm KCl in Buffer HG) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Factions with activity were pooled and diluted with Buffer HG to decrease the concentration of KCl to less than 0.1 m. The sample was then applied to a Hi Trap Blue column (1 ml) equilibrated with HG.1 and developed with a linear gradient from 100 to 1000 mm KCl in Buffer HG at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions with activity were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer PG. The sample was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Scale CHT2-I (2 ml)) equilibrated with PG.1 and developed with a linear gradient from 100 to 300 mm potassium phosphate in Buffer PG at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The pooled fractions with high activity were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) to show the protein band representing the mt CCA-adding enzyme. Following SDS-PAGE, candidate bands were excised, then soaked in a buffer containing 0.2 m NH4HCO3with 50% acetonitrile, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min to remove SDS from the gels. To ensure the complete removal of SDS, the step was repeated twice. The gel pieces were dried completely in vacuo, then rehydrated with trypsin digestion solution (0.2m NH4HCO3, 15 ng/µll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Pierce)), and incubated for 12 h at 30 °C. The peptides were extracted from the gel by incubation with 200 µl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile (3 × 20 min) with shaking. The collected fractions were combined, and the peptides were dried and dissolved in 40 µl of 0.1% formic acid for peptide mass mapping by LC/MS/MS. A Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) equipped with an electrospray ionization source and Magic 2002 HPLC system (Michrom BioResource) was used for peptide analysis. The LC/MS/MS analysis and protein identification were performed as described (25Suzuki T. Terasaki M. Takemoto-Hori C. Hanada T. Ueda T. Wada A. Watanabe K. J. Biol.

The data set of the peptide product ions generated from the triple play analysis was used to search the human and mouse EST data bases using the SEQUEST search program (27Dongre A.R. Eng J.K.

Chem. 2000; 72: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The partially purified fraction containing the CCA-adding enzyme was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The band corresponding to the enzyme, which was identified by mass spectrometric analysis, was excised and subjected to a gas-phase protein Sequencer (PPSQ-21, Shimadzu) using Edman degradation to determine the amino-terminal sequence. The degenerate primers for 5′-RACE were designed from the human cDNA sequence of the mt CCA-adding enzyme found from the EST data base. The cDNA primer for first strand cDNA synthesis is 5′-TCTGTCAGACTCTTCAGTCCTTCTG-3′, and the nested primer for PCR amplification of dC-tailed cDNA is 5′-TGAAAAGTGACTGGAATTCGGGAGA-3′. 5′-RACE was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 5′-RACE product was then cloned into a pCR-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive clones, and the 5′ region of the bovine cDNA was sequenced. The full-length coding region of the human mt CCA-adding enzyme cDNA was amplified from human total RNA using primers that were designed to bind outside the coding region; sense and antisense primers were 5′-GGAGTAGGCTGTGCCTTCTGAAGCAG-3′ and 5′-TGCTTTTTAGTAGCCATCAGTTTTAG-3′, respectively. Nested primers for the second round of PCR were upstream primer with a NdeI site (5′-AAAAGGGGCATATGTTCACAATGAAGTTGCAG-3′) and downstream primer with a XhoI site (5′-CCTTTCTCGAGGGTCTTCTTTATGTAACTC-3′). The first codon of the mature enzyme (CTA) in the upstream primer was changed to ATG to create an initiation codon (underlined). The PCR product was cloned into the corresponding sites of the pET-29a-c(+) vector (Novagen) to obtain the expression vector, pET-CCAmt. The transformant of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying pET-CCAmt was cultured in LB broth (100 µg/ml ampicillin) at 37 °C to an A 600 value of 0.6, and expression was induced by incubation with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells harvested from 1 liter of LB broth were resuspended in 20 ml of HT buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.03% (w/v) egg white lysozyme, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and disrupted by an 8-min sonication (repeated 1-s bursts following 4-s cooling periods) at 100 watts at 0 °C. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant fraction (S100) was loaded onto a nickel-charged HiTrap chelating column (5 ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the non-bound proteins were washed off, the recombinant protein was eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient from 0 to 350 mm imidazole in HT buffer. The recombinant mt CCA enzyme was eluted in a fraction containing about 200 mm imidazole and then dialyzed against HT buffer. Glycerol was added to the enzyme to a final concentration of 30%, frozen quickly with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. E. coli CCA-adding enzyme was overexpressed and purified as described by Tomari et al. (12Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Ueda T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The assays were performed under the same conditions described under “Assays of CCA-adding Activity for Purification of Bovine mt CCA-adding Enzyme,” and the activity was detected by gel electrophoresis. Substrate tRNAs were prepared as follows. Yeast tRNAPhe–DC (3′-CA-truncated) was synthesized by the run-off transcription using T7 RNA polymerase as described by Milligan and Uhlenbeck (29Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Native mitochondrial tRNAs that had been confirmed to contain 3′-truncated forms were kindly provided by Takeo Suzuki (University of Tokyo). In vitro transcribedAscaris suum mitochondrial tRNAMet-DC was from Dr. Takashi Ohtsuki and Sarin Chimnaronk (University of Tokyo). The initial rates of the CCA-adding activity were determined using different concentrations of 3′-truncated tRNAs ranging from 1 to 20 µm. Results were used in Lineweaver-Burk plots to determine the apparent K m andk cat values. Yeast tRNAPhe-DC was prepared as described (29Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). To uniformly truncate the native bovine mitochondrial tRNAAla, the CCA end was first completed with the human mt CCA-adding enzyme, and then 3′-terminal A was removed by periodate oxidation and dephosphorylation (30Keith G. Gilham P.T. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3601-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The CCA-adding enzyme from bovine liver mitochondria was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of the CCA-adding enzyme in the protein fractions was easily detected by [α-32P]AMP incorporation into the 3′-truncated tRNA mixture that acted as the substrate. However, in the presence of other nucleotidyltransferase enzymes such as poly(A) polymerase, it was difficult to differentiate between the activities of the two enzymes. To ensure specificity of the assay system, we performed a control experiment using denaturing gel electrophoresis of the tRNA mixture after the reaction to enable discrimination of the two activities; only the tRNA fraction was labeled with [α-32P]AMP by theE. coli CCA-adding enzyme, whereas 5 S rRNA present in the mixture was labeled by E. coli poly(A) polymerase (Fig.1B, lanes 2 and3). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, using the gel electrophoresis assay we were able to distinguish the two enzyme activities present in the protein fractions separated by anion exchange chromatography in Step 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). CCA-adding activity was isolated in different fractions (Fractions 29–35) to those with poly(A) polymerizing activity (Fractions 25–31), indicating that two enzyme activities in bovine mitochondria could be distinctively measured by this assay. For further purification, we adopted a simplified method using cellulose filters (filter assay) to detect activity instead of gel electrophoresis because most of the poly(A) polymerase activity was eliminated during the first three steps. We concentrated the fraction containing the CCA-adding activity with three more steps of column chromatography. Hi Trap Blue in Step 4 was particularly effective in the purification of the enzyme (data not shown). The active fractions after Step 5 were separated by SDS-PAGE, and about 10 bands were observed following Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1 C). We selected three bands (MC1, MC2, and MC3) as candidates for the mitochondrial CCA-adding enzyme, considering that the quantities of these bands in the fractions correlated well with the activity profile. The three protein bands were excised from the gel, digested by trypsin, and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis (LC/MS/MS), and the results were searched against human and mouse data bases. Protein bands MC1 and MC2 were identified as known mt metabolic proteins (shown in the legend to Fig.1). The analysis of protein MC3 with 47 kDa clearly hit to the human EST sequence AW582962. This EST has high sequence homology to enzymes belonging to class II of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily that includes eukaryotic and eubacterial CCA-adding enzymes. The EST also possesses conserved DXD and RRD motifs within the amino-terminal domain, responsible for nucleotide incorporation activity (Fig.2C). The complete cDNA sequences encoding the proteins in human and mouse were obtained by assembling many related EST sequences retrieved by a BLAST search, and gaps and sequencing errors were corrected (Fig. 2 C). Many peptide ions in the tryptic digest of MC3 were identified in the complete cDNA sequence (Fig. 2, A and C). Each peptide sequence was confirmed by assignment of a CID spectrum (Fig. 2 B). The cDNA sequence encoding the amino-terminal region of the bovine enzyme was determined using 5′-RACE. Because bovine and human mt CCA-adding enzymes have a TGA codon 15 nucleotides upstream from the start of the predicted ORF, we could determine the initial ATG codon of the enzyme with confidence (Figs. 2 C and3). The sequence of the amino terminus of the mature enzyme from bovine mitochondria was determined to be NH2-MFTMXLQXPEFQSLF by peptide sequencing (Figs. 2 C and 3). This also revealed that the amino-terminal 26-amino acid peptide of the precursor protein was removed after importation into the mitochondria (Figs. 2 Cand 3). The calculated molecular mass of the putative human mature protein is 47 kDa, which is the same size as the purified bovine enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 C). We noted in the data base the presence of the protein sequence, CGI-47, which covers a large region of the human CCA-adding enzyme, compiled by Lai et al. (31Lai C.H. Chou C.Y. Ch'ang L.Y. Liu C.S. Lin W. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This sequence was derived from comparative gene identification in silico using Caenorhabditis elegans proteins as queries. However, this sequence lacks the amino-terminal region of the human CCA-adding enzyme that we have shown to be present. Also, in the CGI-47 sequence, an internal methionine at position 30 has been incorrectly ascribed as the putative initiation methionine (Figs. 2 C and 3). During the assembly of the ESTs, we found a splice variant of the human cDNA that shared the amino-terminal region. This prompted us to search the human genome draft sequence (32Lander E.S.

Yan C. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) using the cDNA sequences as queries. We found that the gene encoding the human mt CCA-adding enzyme was located at chromosome 3p25.1 and was composed of seven exons (Fig.4). In addition, two pseudogenes were identified on chromosomes 1 and 22, respectively. It is conceivable that the observed splice variant was produced by an incorrect splicing event between exons 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 4. A small protein containing exon 1 of the gene encoding the CCA-adding enzyme could be translated from the splice variant. However, we could not detect a similar splice variant in the mouse, suggesting that this variation in the splicing process is a human-specific event. The sequences of mammalian mt CCA-adding enzymes were aligned with other paralogues from bacteria and Drosophila, which were retrieved by a BLAST search using the human counterpart as a query (Fig. 3). Analysis showed that the mammalian enzymes had higher homology to the Drosophila enzyme than to the bacterial counterparts. These enzymes commonly have conserved DXD and RRD motifs in their amino-terminal regions, which are characteristic for members of the class II nucleotidyltransferase superfamily. High sequence homology was observed among the amino-terminal regions, whereas there was low homology in the carboxyl-terminal regions. The human mt CCA-adding enzyme was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using primers designed from the mature sequence and cloned into the pET29a vector. According to the amino-terminal position of the matured bovine enzyme, leucine at position 27 should be the corresponding amino terminus of the human enzyme. We therefore replaced the Leu at position 27 with Met to create an initiation codon to express the matured human mt enzyme. The human enzyme, with a carboxyl-terminal His-tag, was expressed in E. coli and isolated with high purity (Fig.5A). About 20 mg of the recombinant protein was purified from 1 liter of culture."
https://openalex.org/W2095248073,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is highly overexpressed in prostate cancer. One important regulator ofPSA expression is the androgen receptor (AR), the nuclear receptor that mediates the biological actions of androgens. AR is able to up-regulate PSA expression by directly binding and activating the promoter of this gene. We provide evidence here that that this AR activity is repressed by the tumor suppressor protein p53. p53 appears to exert its inhibition of human AR (hAR) by disrupting its amino- to carboxyl-terminal (N-to-C) interaction, which is thought to be responsible for the homodimerization of this receptor. Consistent with this, p53 is also able to block hAR DNA binding in vitro. Our previous data have shown that c-Jun can mediate hAR transactivation, and this appears to result from a positive effect on hAR N-to-C interaction and DNA binding. Interestingly, c-Jun is able to relieve the negative effects of p53 on hAR transactivation, N-to-C interaction, and DNA binding, demonstrating antagonistic activities of these two proteins. Importantly, a p53 mutation found in metastatic prostate cancer severely disrupts the p53 negative activity on hAR, suggesting that the inability of p53 mutants to down-regulate hAR is, in part, responsible for the metastatic phenotype.

This is well exemplified by the role of the androgen receptor (AR)1 in male sexual development, which is disrupted in males with androgen insensitivity syndrome (for review, see Ref. 1Barthold J.S. Kumasi-Rivers K. Upadhyay J. Shekarriz B. Imperato-Mcginley J. J. Urol. 2000; 164: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such disruptions result in males who are unable to respond to androgens because of mutations in the AR and who therefore can develop, in the most severe case, the sexual phenotype of a female. In keeping with this, development of the prostate, a male-specific gland, is dependent upon the activity of AR and its cognate androgen ligands, testosterone and dihydroxytestosterone (DHT) (2Keller E.T. Ershler W.B. Chang C. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3Chang C. Kokontis J. Liao S.

Testosterone and DHT act by specifically binding to the AR and activating it such that it can up-regulate the transcription of specific responsive genes. This paradigm of receptor activation is a defining characteristic of nuclear receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 5Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G.

Nuclear receptors regulate transcription by binding, as either homodimers or heterodimers, to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. While the receptors for retinoids, thyroids, and vitamin D bind to DNA as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors, the AR and receptors for glucocorticoids, progestins, and estrogens carry out the same activity as homodimers (for reviews, see Refs. 5Beato M.

Interestingly AR and estrogen receptor α have been suggested to form antiparallel homodimers based on the demonstration of a high affinity interaction between the amino and carboxyl termini of the receptor (10Doesburg P.

With respect to AR, the physiological significance of this N-to-C interaction is suggested by the recent finding that several mutations responsible for androgen insensitivity syndrome disrupt this interaction without affecting ligand binding (12Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Moreover we have recently demonstrated by mutational analysis that disruption of the N-to-C interaction blocks hAR DNA bindingin vitro. 2A. Bubulya, S.-Y. Chen, C. J. Fisher, Z. Zheng, X.-Q. Shen, and L. Shemshedini, submitted. 2A. Bubulya, S.-Y. Chen, C. J. Fisher, Z. Zheng, X.-Q. Shen, and L. Shemshedini, submitted. Hence it may be concluded that hAR N-to-C interaction is critical for the ability of this receptor to up-regulate the transcription of androgenresponsive genes. One clinically important androgen-responsive gene is prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which encodes a serine protease that is a diagnostic marker for prostate (for reviews, see Refs. 14Oesterling J.E. J. Urol. 1991; 145: 907-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar and 15Catalona W.J. Smith D.S. Ratliff T.L. Dodds K.M. Coplen D.E. Yuan J.J. Petros J.A. Andriole G.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1156-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). The androgen regulation of PSA gene expression is mediated by the presence of three androgen-responsive elements within the 5.8-kilobase pair PSA promoter, all of which have been shown to bind AR (16Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 17Cleutjens K.B. van Eekelen C.C. van der Korput H.A. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Two of these androgen-responsive elements are located within the proximal region of the promoter at −170 and −395 (17Cleutjens K.B. van Eekelen C.C. van der Korput H.A. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. J.

Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Interestingly, of the two proximal elements, the more distally located element (−395) has the unique activity of functioning as an androgen-responsive element only in the presence of the more proximal (−170) element and thus is called an androgen-responsive region (17Cleutjens K.B. van Eekelen C.C. van der Korput H.A. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6379-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In addition to these androgen-regulated elements, PSApromoter activity has been shown to be regulated by other types of elements, including GATA (19Perez-Stable C.M. Pozas A. Roos B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and elements for PDEF, a novel ets transcription factor (20Oettgen P. Finger E. Sun Z. Akbarali Y. Thamrongsak U. Boltax J.

Both the GATA-binding proteins (GATA-2 and GATA-3) and prostate-derived Ets factor have been reported to modulate androgen induction of the PSA promoter (19Perez-Stable C.M. Pozas A. Roos B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Oettgen P. Finger E. Sun Z. Akbarali Y. Thamrongsak U. Boltax J. Grall F. Dube A. Weiss A. Brown L. Quinn G. Kas K.

Thus, it is clear that the complex nature of the PSA promoter renders AR activation of this promoter regulatable by other DNA-binding proteins. p53 is a DNA-binding protein that has been shown to inhibit the production of PSA when it is expressed in tumors in nude mice (21Eastham J.A. Grafton W. Martin C.M. Williams B.J. J. Urol. 2000; 164: 814-819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ko S.C. Gotoh A. Thalmann G.N. Zhau H.E. Johnston D.A. Zhang W.W. Kao C. Chung L.W. Hum.

This negative effect on PSA production is consistent with the known negative activities of p53 on transcription that have been seen on many cellular and viral promoters (for review, see Ref. 24Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6733) Google Scholar). These activities do not depend on sequence-specific DNA binding by p53 since they have been observed on promoters that do not contain p53-responsive elements (25Ginsberg D. Mechta F. Yaniv M. Oren M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9979-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 26Seto E. Usheva A. Zambetti G.P. Momand J. Horikoshi N. Weinmann R. Levine A.J. Shenk T. Proc. Natl.

However, this negative transcriptional activity by p53 does require its carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids, which have been identified to be involved in the interaction of p53 with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) (29Liu X. Miller C.W. Koeffler P.H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the TBP interaction with p53 through the carboxyl terminus is inhibitory to the transcription process. In addition, p53 is known to repress the transcription process when bound to DNA demonstrated by fusing p53 to heterologous DNA-binding domains (DBDs) (30Horikoshi N. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This same approach has been used recently to identify an eight-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl terminus of p53 that is essential for transcriptional repression (31Hong T.M. Chen J.J. Peck K. Yang P.C. Wu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1510-1515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast to the negative transcriptional activities of p53 that can occur on or off DNA, the positive transcriptional activities of this protein have only been observed on DNA (for review, see Ref. 24Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6733) Google Scholar). Because DNA binding is essential, the transactivation function of p53 relies on the central portion of the protein. This portion contains a zinc finger-like DBD that is responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding (32Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). In addition, the amino-terminal region (amino acids 1–42) of p53, which serves as the binding site for the p53 repressors E1B or MDM2 (33Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), harbors a transcriptional activation domain (29Liu X. Miller C.W. Koeffler P.H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell.

Interestingly this amino-terminal region serves as a second site for interaction with TBP (and TBP-associated factors) (29Liu X. Miller C.W. Koeffler P.H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell.

Mutations of the p53 gene are associated with many cancers, including prostate cancer (for reviews, see Refs. 24Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6733) Google Scholar and 38Bangma C.H. Nasu Y. Ren C. Thompson T.C. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 422-427PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the known p53 negative effects on transcription, the finding that expression of p53 in prostate tumors reduces production of PSA (21Eastham J.A. Grafton W. Martin C.M. Williams B.J. J.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4716-4720PubMed Google Scholar) opens the possibility that p53 regulates PSA promoter activity. Here we report that p53 is capable of negatively regulating AR-induced transactivation of the PSA promoter. This activity appears to be mediated by the ability of p53 to disrupt hAR N-to-C interaction and in vitro DNA binding. hAR and c-Jun were expressed from the mammalian expression plasmid pSG5 (39Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The p53 plasmids hp53WT, hp53ΔC30, and hp53W248 (generous gifts from Dr. Thanas Halazonetis) were described previously (40Halazonetis T.D. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Halazonetis T.D. Davis L.J. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To make GAL-hAR(DE), the GAL4 DBD was first amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the upstream oligonucleotide 5′-GATCGAATTCGATATCTAGAAGCTTCTATGAAGCTACTGTCT-3′ and the downstream oligonucleotide 5′-GATCAGATCTATTCAGTCAGGGCCCGAGCTCGGATCCGGT-3′ and inserted into pTL1, a derivative of pSG5, to make the plasmid pG4AB. Then the hAR DE region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the upstream oligonucleotide 5′-GATCGGTACCCTCGAGTCTAGAACTCTGGGAGCCCG-GAAG-3′ and the downstream oligonucleotide 5′-GATCGGATCCTCACTGGGTGTGGAAATA-3′ and inserted into pG4AB, yielding GAL-hAR(DE). VP16-hAR(AB) was constructed by digesting the AB region out of hAR with EcoRI andXhoI and inserting it into the EcoRI andSalI sites of pCMX-VP16-N (42Dhordain P. Albagli O. Lin R.J. Ansieau S.

The reporter plasmids have the gene for either luciferase (LUC) or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) driven by different promoters. The AR-inducible reporter plasmid PSA-LUC was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the PSA promoter (43Montgomery B.T. Young C.Y. Bilhartz D.L. Andrews P.E. Prescott J.L. Thompson N.F. Tindall D.J. Prostate. 1992; 21: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) using the upstream oligonucleotide 5′-GATCGGTACCCATTGTTTGCTGCAC-3′ and the downstream oligonucleotide 5′-GATCCCCGGGTCCGGGTGCACCTCC-3′ and PSA-630-CAT (a generous gift from Dr. Charles Young) as template. This resulted in the amplification of the PSA promoter from −624 to +12. Polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested and ligated into the KpnI/SmaI site of pGL3 (Promega). The p53-inducible p50-2-CAT reporter (a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Shenk) was described previously (30Horikoshi N. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For the mammalian two-hybrid system, the previously described reporter 17 M-tk-CAT (44Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3839-3849Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar) was used. Transfection efficiency was standardized using either pRL-tk-LUC (Promega) for the luciferase assay or pCH110 for the CAT assay. PC-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cells were plated at about 60% confluency in 60-mm dishes and transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (44Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3839-3849Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after the introduction of DNA and subjected to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum containing 100 nm hormone or ethanol carrier. Cells were then harvested 24–48 h postwash in passive lysis buffer (Promega) for the luciferase assay or β-galactosidase buffer (44Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3839-3849Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar) for the CAT assay. Luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit from Promega. 100 µl of cell extract were assayed for firefly luciferase activity using a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Transfection efficiency was normalized byRenilla luciferase activity according to the instructions of the manufacturer. CAT assays were standardized according to β-galactosidase activity and performed as described previously (44Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3839-3849Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). All transfections were performed at least three times, and the results presented for luciferase and CAT assays are the mean values of three independent experiments. Standard deviations are indicated as error bars. COS cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (according to instructions from Invitrogen). Cells were treated with 100 nm DHT 24 h prior to harvesting. Cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. 10% of the cells were used to do a β-galactosidase assay for quantification of transfection efficiency. The remainder of the cells were resuspended in Buffer I (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm NaCl; 5 mm MgCl2) and incubated at 4 °C for 5 min. 0.3 m sucrose was then added, and cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging lysed cells at 2500 rpm (600 × g) for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was washed once with Buffer II (Buffer I containing 0.3 m sucrose). Then the nuclear pellet was resuspended in Buffer III (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 150 mm NaCl; 5 mm EDTA; 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors and incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysed nuclei were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant, constituting the nuclear extract, was saved. The amount of extract used was standardized according to β-galactosidase activity. Gel mobility shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts containing the same amount of β-galactosidase activity. These reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 µl in DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8; 0.1 mm EDTA; 4 mm dithiothreitol), which also containing 1 µg of poly(dI-dC), 100 mm KCl, and 100,000 cpm32P-labeled probe (5′-GATCCAAAGTCAGAACACAGTGTTCTGATCAAAGA-3′), an androgen-responsive element. After the addition of an equal number of β-galactosidase units of nuclear extract, the reactions were gently vortexed and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. The samples were run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel for 1.5 h at room temperature after which the gel was dried and exposed to autoradiography. To do antibody supershifts, 1 µl of either the anti-hAR antibody PA1-111A or the anti-birch profilin antibody 4A6 (a kind gift from Dr. Martin Rothkegel) was added prior to addition of probe. Cell extracts were prepared in two ways for Western blot analysis. For PC-3 cells, the pellets from transfected cells, remaining after lysis and extraction for luciferase and CAT assays, were boiled for 5–10 min in SDS Sample Buffer (63 mm Tris, pH 6.8; 20% glycerol; 2% SDS; 5% β-mercaptoethanol). The amount of boiled pellet used was standardized according to internal control activity (Renilla luciferase activity for luciferase and β-galactosidase for CAT assays). For transfected COS cells, the nuclear extracts prepared for gel mobility shift assays were also used in Western blot analysis. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose blots (Micron Separations Inc.). The nitrocellulose blots were blocked with nonfat dry milk and subsequently probed with either the anti-p53 antibody 13-4000 (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories) or the anti-hAR antibody PA1-111A (Affinity BioReagents) and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. We have previously observed the c-Jun positive effect on hAR transactivation in COS, HeLa, NIH3T3, P19, and F9 cells (44Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H.

Since this receptor is not known to have a physiological role in the tissues from which these cells were derived, we elected to use cells originating from the prostate, whose development is tightly regulated by androgens and AR. These are PC-3 cells, and they were derived from bone metastasis of prostate cancer (49Kaighn M.E. Narayan K.S. Ohnuki Y. Lechner J.F. Jones L.W. Investig. Urol. 1979; 17: 16-23PubMed Google Scholar). Although PC-3 cells have lost expression of AR (50Tilley W.D. Wilson C.M. Marcelli M. McPhaul M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5382-5386PubMed Google Scholar), they have been used extensively in transfection studies to study AR-mediated transcription (for reviews, see Refs. 51Jenster G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421PubMed Google Scholarand 52Culig Z. Hobisch A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used these same cells in this study to determine whether p53 modulates hAR-induced transactivation of the PSApromoter. This was done by transiently transfecting PC-3 cells with the androgen-responsive reporter PSA-624-LUC and expression plasmids for hAR and p53, both of which are not expressed in these prostate cells (50Tilley W.D. Wilson C.M. Marcelli M. McPhaul M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5382-5386PubMed Google Scholar, 53Liang J.Y. Fontana J.A. Rao J.N. Ordonez J.V. Dawson M.I. Shroot B. Wilber J.F. Feng P. Prostate. 1999; 38: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transfection of hAR in PC-3 cells resulted in DHT-dependent activation of the PSA promoter, which did not occur in the absence of transfected hAR (Fig.1), consistent with the lack of endogenous hAR. Co-expression of p53 completely blocked this ligand-dependent hAR activity without significantly affecting the basal activity of the promoter in the absence of transfected hAR (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that p53 is capable of repressing hAR transactivation of the PSA promoter. Like other transcription factors, p53 consists of multiple functional domains required for the multitude of cellular functions that this protein has (for review, see Ref. 24Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6733) Google Scholar). Previous data show that regions important for p53-mediated transcriptional repression include the carboxyl terminus (29Liu X. Miller C.W. Koeffler P.H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and, on some TATA box-containing promoters, the central region encoding the DBD (32Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). To determine whether either of these regions is important for hAR inhibition, two p53 mutants were studied for repression of hAR transactivation. Mutant p53W248, containing an Arg to Trp change at position 248, is deficient in specific DNA binding (41Halazonetis T.D. Davis L.J. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and p53ΔC30 has a deletion of the last 30 amino acids that results in the loss of interaction with the TBP (40Halazonetis T.D. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While both mutant proteins are able to repress hAR transactivation of the PSA promoter, they are significantly weaker than wild-type p53 (Fig. 2A). This difference in activity is not due to different levels of protein expression of the mutants since Western blot analysis demonstrated that the mutant p53 proteins are slightly more highly expressed than wild-type p53 (Fig. 2B). Moreover the expression of transfected hAR is not affected by any of the p53 proteins (Fig.2C), clearly showing that inhibition of hAR transcriptional activity is not due to reduced hAR protein levels. These data show that the p53 DBD and carboxyl terminus are important for its repression of hAR transactivation. Previous work has demonstrated an in vivointeraction between the AB and E regions of AR (10Doesburg P. Kuil C.W. Berrevoets C.A. Steketee K. Faber P.W. Mulder E. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J.

Addition of aluminum fluoride to cells co-transfected with PKD and wild type Gα13 also induced PKD activation. Co-transfection of Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin blocked activation of PKD by RhoQ63L, Lbc, or aluminum fluoride-stimulated Gα13. Treatment with the protein kinase C inhibitors GF I or Ro 31-8220 prevented the increase in PKD activity induced by RhoQ63L, Lbc, or aluminum fluoride-stimulated Gα13. PKD activation in response to Gα13 signaling was also completely prevented by mutation of Ser-744 and Ser-748 to Ala in the kinase activation loop of PKD. Co-expression of C. botulinum C3 toxin and a COOH-terminal fragment of Gαq that acts in a dominant-negative fashion blocked PKD activation in response to agonist stimulation of bombesin receptor. Expression of the COOH-terminal region of Gα13 also attenuated PKD activation in response to bombesin receptor stimulation. Our results show that Gα13 contributes to PKD activation through a Rho- and protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathway and indicate that PKD activation is mediated by both Gαq and Gα13 in response to bombesin receptor stimulation.

Sinnett-Smith J. Zugaza J.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Specifically, exposure of intact cells to phorbol esters, cell-permeant DAGs, or bryostatin induces rapid PKD phosphorylation and activation, which is maintained during cell lysis and immunoprecipitation (8Rozengurt E.

Several lines of evidence, including the use of PKC-specific inhibitors and co-transfection of PKD with constitutively active PKC mutants, indicate that PKD is activated through a novel PKC-dependent signal transduction pathway in vivo (9Zugaza J.L.

The residues Ser-744 and Ser-748 in the activation loop of PKD have been identified as critical phosphorylation sites in PKD activation induced by phorbol esters (14Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest an important connection between PKCs and PKD and indicate that PKD can function downstream of PKC in a novel signal transduction pathway. Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) are composed of α, β, and γ subunits and transduce external signals from heptahelical receptors to intracellular effectors (15Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 177-198PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian G protein α subunits are classified into four subfamilies: Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12. The α subunit of Gq stimulates the β isoforms of phospholipase C (PLC) that catalyze the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate that triggers the release of Ca2+ from internal stores and diacylglycerol (DAG) that activates the classical and novel isoforms of PKC (reviewed in Ref.16Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We reported that a variety of neuropeptide agonists that signal through heptahelical receptors and couple to heterotrimeric G proteins, including bombesin, bradykinin, endothelin, and vasopressin, induce rapid PKD activation in normal and neoplastic cells (11Zugaza J.L.

Taken together, these results prompted us to consider the possibility that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) stimulate PKD activation not only via Gαq but also through other, as yet unidentified, G protein-mediated signaling pathways. Many Gq-coupled receptors also interact with other heterotrimeric G proteins including members of the G12family which mediate activation of the low molecular weight G proteins of the Rho subfamily (20Hooley R., Yu, C.Y.

These considerations prompted us to examine whether, in addition to Gαq, Rho- and Gα13-mediated signaling can promote PKD activation in intact cells and whether endogenous Rho and Gα13 could contribute to PKD activation in response to bombesin receptor stimulation. The results presented here demonstrate that co-expression of PKD with constitutively activated Rho, the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor pOnco-Lbc (45Olson M.F. Sterpetti P. Nagata K.-I. Toksoz D. Hall A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 46Zheng Y. Olson M.F. Hall A. Cerione R.A. Toksoz D. J. Biol.

TheClostridium botulinum C3 toxin, which inactivates Rho, selectively prevented PKD activation in response to Rho, Lbc, and Gα13 and attenuated PKD activation in response to bombesin GPCR activation. PKD activation induced by Gα13/Rho signaling was prevented by PKC inhibitors and by mutation of Ser-744 and Ser-748 in the kinase activation loop of PKD to alanine, a non-phosphorylatable residue. Expression of a COOH-terminal fragment of Gαq that acts in a dominant-negative fashion together with the C3 toxin virtually abolished PKD activation induced by agonist stimulation of the bombesin receptor. Thus, our results identify PKD as a novel downstream target in Gα13 and Rho signaling and indicate that bombesin GPCR stimulation promotes PKD activation via both Gq- and Gα13/Rho-dependent pathways. COS-7 cells were maintained by subculture in 10-cm tissue culture plates every 3–4 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. For experimental dishes, cells were subcultured at 6 × 104 cells/ml in 6- (5 ml) or 10-cm (10 ml) dishes on the day prior to transfections. All transfections and co-transfections were carried out with equivalent amounts of DNA (6 µg/6-cm dish and 12 µg/10-cm dish). Transfections were carried out in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 10 µl/6-cm dish or 20 µl/10-cm dish, added to cells in a final volume of 2.5 ml/6-cm dish or 5 ml/10-cm dish, following formation of DNA-Lipofectin complexes according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Cells were allowed to take up complexes in the absence of FBS for 5–6 h or overnight and then FBS (10% final concentration) in Opti-MEM was added to the dishes to yield a final volume of 5 ml/6-cm dish or 10 ml/10-cm dish. Cells were used for experiments after a further 48–72 h of incubation. The wild type Gαq subunit cDNAs in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA-1 (Invitrogen) (47Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H.

Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate DNA encoding for the carboxyl-terminal region of Gα13 (residues 333–377) using the murine Gα13 cDNA as a template with sense (5′-GCTCAAGCTTCGAAACGCCGGGACCAGCAGCAG-3′) and antisense (5′-GGTGGATCCTCACTGCAGCATGAGCTGCTTCAG-3′) primers. The resulting DNA fragment was subcloned into theBamHI and HindIII restriction sites of pcDNA-3. The fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The BamHI/HindIII DNA fragment was cloned in pεGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Inc., La Jolla, CA) such that the resulting fusion protein produced by this plasmid would be a hybrid εGFP containing Gα13(residues 333–377) at its carboxyl terminus. Transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and equilibrated in 5 ml of the same medium at 37 °C for 1–2 h. Some dishes were treated with various pharmacological agents during this equilibration period or with agonists for 10 min at the end of this period, as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, hydrochloride (Pefabloc), and 1% Triton X-100). PKD was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 3 h with the PA-1 antiserum (1:50 dilution) raised against the synthetic peptide EEREMKALSERVSIL that corresponds to the COOH-terminal region of PKD as described previously (6Valverde A.M.

Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and then twice with kinase buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Autophosphorylation reactions were initiated by combining 20 µl of immune complexes with 5 µl of a phosphorylation mixture containing 100 µm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 400–600 cpm/pmol) in kinase buffer. Following incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reactions were terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold kinase buffer and placed on ice. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation, and the proteins were extracted for SDS-PAGE analysis by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). Dried SDS-PAGE gels were subjected to autoradiography to visualize radiolabeled protein bands. For assays of exogenous substrate phosphorylation, immune complexes were processed as for autophosphorylation reactions, and then substrate (syntide-2, final concentration 2.5 mg/ml) was added in the presence of 100 µm [γ-32P]ATP (400–600 cpm/pmol) in kinase buffer (final reaction volume, 30 µl). After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reactions were terminated by adding 100 µl of 75 mm H3PO4, and 75 µl of the mixed supernatant was spotted to Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Papers were washed thoroughly in 75 mmH3PO4 and dried, and radioactivity incorporated into syntide-2 was determined by detection of Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter. Samples of cell lysates were directly solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on 8% gels (for PKD) or 10% gel (for G proteins), proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), as described previously (9Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J.

Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 3 h with antisera specifically recognizing either PKD, the different G proteins (Gαq or Gα13), or GFP at 1:250–1:500 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% non-fat dried milk. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and subsequent enhanced chemiluminescence detection or 125I-labeled protein A followed by autoradiography. The Gαq antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal decapeptide of this G protein that was cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde. The Gα13antiserum was raised against the synthetic peptide CLHDNLKQLMLQ (which corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal peptide 367–377 of murine Gα13 with an amino-terminal cysteine added for coupling) cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with the hetero-bifunctional reagent sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl) butyrate, as described (52Offermanns S.

All other reagents were from standard suppliers or as described in the text and were the highest grade commercially available. To test whether PKD activation can be induced by signaling pathway(s) initiated by the low molecular weight G proteins of the Rho subfamily, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with PKD and expression vectors encoding wild type Rho, Ras, Rac or constitutively active forms of the three proteins, RhoQ63L, RasVal12, or RacVal12. PKD was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of transfected cells with PA-1 antiserum, and the immune complexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography to detect the prominent 110-kDa band corresponding to autophosphorylated PKD. The results presented in Fig.1A show for the first time that cells co-transfected with RhoQ63L and PKD exhibit a marked increase in PKD activity compared with cells transfected with either PKD and wild type Rho or with PKD alone. Similar results were obtained when PKD activity in immunocomplexes was determined by phosphorylation of syntide-2 (54Mochizuki H. Ito T. Hidaka H. J. Biol.

We verified that the level of PKD expression in cells co-transfected with Rho (either wild type or QL) and PKD was similar to those transfected with PKD (Fig. 1C).

The present study investigated the effect of UV exposure on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation in epidermal cells and determined if a relationship exists between these UV responses. Exposure of mouse epidermal JB6 Cl 41 cells to UV radiation led to specific phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308 in a time-dependent manner. This phosphorylation was confirmed by the observation that overexpression of Akt mutant, Akt-T308/S473A, attenuated phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308. UV radiation also generated ROS as measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) in JB6 Cl 41 cells. The generation of ROS by UV radiation was measured further by H2O2 and O⨪2 fluorescence staining assays. The mechanism of ROS generation involved reduction of molecular oxygen to O⨪2, which generated H2O2 through dismutation. H2O2 produced ⋅OH via a metal-independent pathway. The scavenging of UV-generated H2O2 byN-acety-l-cyteine (NAC, a general antioxidant) or catalase (a specific H2O2 inhibitor) inhibited Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308, whereas the pretreatment of cells with sodium formate (an ⋅OH radical scavenger) or superoxide dismutase (an O⨪2 radical scavenger) did not show any inhibitory effects. Furthermore, treatment of cells with H2O2 increased UV-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308. These results demonstrate that UV radiation generates a whole spectrum of ROS including O⨪2, ⋅OH, and H2O2 and induces phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. Among the various ROS, H2O2 seems most potent in mediating UV-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308.

Experimentally, UV irradiation acts both as a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter in animal models (2Strickland P.T. J. Invest.

Although the mechanism for the tumor-promoting ability of UV is not well understood, it is believed that UV-initiated signal transduction pathways are responsible for its tumor promotion effects. It has been reported that exposure of mammalian cells to UV irradiation including short (UVC, 200–280 nm), long (UVA, 320–400 nm), and mid- (UVB, 280–320 nm) wavelengths leads to a large number of changes in cells such as activation of transcription factors and protein kinases (4Steidl M.

Akt was first found to be involved with signal transduction by the observation that Akt kinase activity is induced by growth factors such as platelet-derived and fibroblast growth factors (24Burgering B.M.

Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). Four phosphorylation sites on Akt have been identified that are phosphorylated in vivoincluding Ser-124, Thr-308, Thr-450, and Ser-473 (26Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Thr-308 and Ser-473 are inducibly phosphorylated after treatment of cells with extracellular stimuli, whereas Ser-124 and Thr-450 appear to be basally phosphorylated (21Datta S.R. Brunet A.

Mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that the phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 is required for Akt activation and that mimicking phosphorylation partially activates Akt (21Datta S.R. Brunet A.

In the present study, we found that UV radiation induces Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308, and this phosphorylation of Akt is mediated by the H2O2 generated by UV radiation. the Akt mutant plasmid, SRα-Akt-T308A/S473A, and its vector control plasmid, SRα, were a generous gift from Dr. Bing-Hua Jiang (West Virginia University) (27Jiang B.H.

Deferoxamine, N-acety-l-cyteine, β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and sodium formate were purchased from Sigma; dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Da) and dihydroethidium (HE) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) were from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD); the phospho-specific Akt (Thr-308) antibody, phospho-specific Akt (Ser-473) antibody, and Akt antibody as well as hemagglutinin-tagged antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs (Berverly, MA). The JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cell line, Cl 41, was cultured in monolayers at 37 °C, 5% CO2, using MEM containing 5% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 µg of gentamicin/ml as described previously (28Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). HE is a specific O⨪2 dye (29Ye J.-P. Wang S. Leonard S.S. Sun Y. Butterworth L. Antonini J. Ding M.

The cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured until 90% confluent. The cells were then treated with UVC radiation (60 J/m2) for 1 min. After a 30-min incubation, HE or Da (both dissolved in Me2SO and diluted with PBS to final concentrations of 5 µm) was applied to the cells and incubated for another 15–20 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested, and applied on slides for observation under a fluorescence microscope. ESR spin trapping was used to detect short-lived free radical intermediates. This technique involves the addition-type reaction of a short-lived radical with a diamagnetic compound (spin trap) to form a relatively long-lived free radical product, the so-called spin adduct, which can be observed by conventional ESR. The intensity of the spin adduct signal corresponds to the amount of short-lived radicals trapped, and the hyperfine splittings of the spin adduct are generally characteristic of the trapped radical. ESR measurements were carried out using a Varian E9 ESR spectrometer and a flat cell assembly. Hyperfine couplings were measured directly from magnetic field separation using potassium tetraperoxochromate (K3CrO8) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl as reference standards. Cl 41 cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and cultured until 90% confluent. The cells were washed once with PBS, and mixtures of 400 mm DMPO and 100 µm NADPH were added to each dish. The cells were then exposed to UVC radiation (60 J/m2) for 1 min. The cells were harvested and transferred to a flat cell for ESR measurement as described previously (30Shi X. Dalal N.S. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured from UVC-exposed cells, because molecular oxygen is the potential source of O⨪2. Oxygen consumption was measured by oxygen equipped with a Clark microelectrode, model 516 (Gilson Medical Electronics, Middleton, WI). Cells (1 × 106/ml) were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and resenting steady-state oxygen consumption was monitored over a period of 10 min. The oxygraph was calibrated using medium equilibrated with gases of known oxygen content. Cl 41 cells were cultured in a 6-well plate until they reached 85–90% confluence. 15 µl of LipofectAMINE reagent with 15 µg of Akt-T308A/S473A plasmid DNA were used to transfect each well in the absence of serum. After 10–12 h, the medium was replaced with 5% FBS MEM. Approximately 24–30 h after the beginning of the transfection, the cells were exposed to either UVB (4 KJ/m2) or UVC (60 J/m2). The cells then were washed once with ice-cold PBS and extracted with SDS sample buffer. The cell extracts were used for Western blot. 2 × 104 of JB6 C1 41 cells were cultured in each well of 6-well plates to 90% confluence with 5% FCS MEM medium. The cells were exposed to either UVB (4 KJ/m2) or UVC (60 J/m2) and incubated for different time points as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were then washed once with ice-cold PBS and extracted with SDS sample buffer. The cell extracts were separated on polyacrylamide-SDS gels, transferred, and probed with one of the antibodies including rabbit phospho-specific Akt (Thr-308) antibody, phospho-specific Akt (Ser-473) antibody, and Akt antibody. The Akt protein bands specifically bound to primary antibodies were detected using an anti-rabbit IgG-AP-linked and eosinophil chemotactic factor Western blotting system (31Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Hanenberger D. Cleary M.P. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26325-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To determine ROS generation by UV radiation directly in culturing cells, the well characterized mouse epidermal cell line Cl 41 and dye staining as well as ESR techniques were used. The results show that UV radiation without cells did not generate any detectable amount of free radicals (Fig. 1a). Exposure of cells to UVC radiation generated a 1:2:2:1 ESR spectrum (Fig. 1 b) with hyperfine splittings ofa H = a N = 14.9 G, wherea N and a H denote hyperfine splittings of the nitroxyl nitrogens and α-hydrogen, respectively. Based on these splittings and the 1:2:2:1 line shape, the spectrum was assigned to the DMPO/⋅OH adduct, which is evidence of ⋅OH radical generation. The addition of NADPH, which enhanced the reduction of molecular oxygen to ROS by NADPH oxidase, enhanced the ⋅OH generation (Fig. 1 c), whereas NADPH with UV radiation or cells with NADPH did not generate any detectable DMPO/⋅OH signal (Fig. 1, d and e). Time course studies show that the radical generation reached a maximum within 7 min after 1 min of exposure (Fig.2). The addition of catalase, a scavenger of H2O2, inhibited ⋅OH radical generation (Fig. 3b), indicating that H2O2 was produced in the UV-treated cells and served as a precursor of ⋅OH generation. The addition of sodium formate, an ⋅OH radical scavenger, decreased the DMPO/⋅OH signal intensity and generated a new spin adduct signal (Fig. 3 c). The hyperfine splittings of this signal are a N = 18.7 G anda N = 15.7 G. These splittings are typical of those DMPO/⋅COO− adducts. The generation of these new radicals is caused by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by⋅OH from formate. The ⋅COO− was trapped by DMPO to generate DMPO/⋅COO− adducts. These results confirm the generation of ⋅OH in UV-irradiated cells. Incubation of the mixture with deferoximine, a metal chelator, did not affect the signal intensity (Fig. 3 d). It may be noted that a previous study has shown that UV photolysis of aqueous H2O2 is able to generate the ⋅OH radical (32Harbour J.R. Chow V. Bolton J.R. Can. J. Chem. 1974; 52: 3549-3553Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that UV-generated ⋅OH requires H2O2 but through a metal-independent mechanism. Measurements using HE, a specific fluorescent dye for O⨪2, or Da, a fluorescent dye for H2O2, demonstrate that exposure of cells to UV radiation led to an increase in the generation of both O⨪2 and H2O2 (Fig.4). Importantly, preincubation of cells with SOD or catalase reduced the fluorescent intensities for O⨪2 and H2O2, respectively (Fig. 4). These observations confirm that UV-induced fluorescence staining by HE and Da are O⨪2 and H2O2, respectively. Exposure of cells to UV radiation resulted in an increased rate of oxygen consumption as comparing with control cells (Fig.5). These results provide direct and strong evidence that UV radiation can induce the generation of ROS in epidermal cells.Figure 2Time course studies on UVC-induced ROS generation.

The results show that UV radiation markedly induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.6a). The maximum induction of Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 in response to either UVB or UVC radiation occurred between 4 and 7 h after exposure (Fig.6 a). To confirm these findings, we transiently transfected the SRα-Akt-T308A/S473A plasmid into Cl 41 cells. The results show that the UV-induced increases of Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 were reduced markedly by the overexpression of Akt protein with Thr-308 and Ser-473 double point mutation (Fig. 6 b). These results demonstrate that UV radiation is a potent stimulus for induction of Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308. The results from the studies discussed above demonstrate that UV radiation can generate ROS in Cl 41 cells. Considering findings from other groups that exogenous H2O2 can induce activation of Akt activity (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar,33Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 in the human glioblastoma cell line (34Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we determined the induction of Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 by H2O2 in mouse epidermal JB6 cell line. The results show that, similar to UV radiation, treatment of cells with H2O2 resulted in an increase in Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 in JB6 cells (Fig. 7). These data suggest that the Akt phosphorylation induced by H2O2 is consistent with the phosphorylation induced by UV radiation. Thus, it is possible that H2O2 generated by UV radiation may be involved in Akt phosphorylation induced by UV radiation. To obtain direct evidence for the involvement of H2O2 in Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 in UV responses, the effects of specific modifiers of ROS on UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 were determined. Pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl-l-cyteine, a general antioxidant, or catalase, a specific H2O2 scavenger, inhibited UV-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308 (Fig.8). In contrast, treatment of the cell with sodium formate, an ⋅OH radical scavenger, did not inhibit UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and and Thr-308 (Fig. 8). It should be noted that increasing H2O2 generation with the addition of SOD or NADPH did not show an increase of UV-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 8). The reason for these observations may be that the generation of H2O2by UV radiation is strong enough to induce maximum Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 in Cl 41 cells. These data suggest that H2O2 generation by UV radiation is involved in UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308. Because the Akt and Erks pathways all are associated with cell growth, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and transformation, it is reasonable to ask whether there is any cross talk between the two pathways. To answer this question, we used PD98059, a specific Erks pathway chemical inhibitor, and a dominant negative Akt mutant, Akt-T308A/S473A. We observed that pretreatment of cells with PD98059 did not show any inhibitory effect on UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308, but it did block UV-induced Erks phosphorylation (Fig. 9). Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant negative Akt mutant, Akt-T308A/S473A, did not affect UV-induced Erks activation, whereas it attenuated increases of Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 induced by UV radiation (Fig.6 b). All the data suggest that there is no observed cross talk between the Erks cascade and Akt pathway in “UV responses.” The results presented in the present study demonstrate that UV radiation leads to the generation of ROS. Among them, H2O2 is responsible for an increase in Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 in mouse epidermal Cl 41 cells. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (a) a fluorescence staining assay shows that exposure of cells to UV radiation lead to H2O2 generation, and ESR spin trapping measurements show that UV-radiated cells generate the⋅OH radical using H2O2 as a precursor; (b) UVC radiation led to an increase of the rate of cell oxygen consumption; (c) catalase, a specific scavenger of H2O2, inhibited UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308, whereas sodium formate, which scavenges⋅OH radicals, exhibited no inhibitory effects, suggesting that⋅OH radicals are not involved in UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308; (d) pretreatment of cells with SOD did not inhibit UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308; instead, it slightly enhanced the Akt phosphorylation, revealing that O⨪2 itself did not cause Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308; and (e) H2O2 alone was able to induce Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308. Thus, among ROS, H2O2 appears to be the one involved in UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308. It is possible that H2O2-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Akt may be involved in UV-induced carcinogenesis. With regard to the mechanism of ROS generation from mouse epidermal Cl 41 cells under UV radiation, it appears that molecular oxygen is reduced to O⨪2 as measured by the oxygen consumption assay. NADPH oxidase is likely to be responsible for the reduction of molecular oxygen, because the addition of NADPH enhanced the ROS generation. O⨪2 generated H2O2 through dismutation. H2O2 produced ⋅OH via a metal-independent pathway as indicated by the failure of deferoximine to inhibit ⋅OH generation. Increased exposure to the UV radiation of sunlight has been associated with an increased incidence of skin cancer (1Parrish J.A. Goldsmith L.A. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Skin. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 333-713Google Scholar). UV radiation not only acts by inducing DNA damage and cell mutagenicity but also can modulate the expression of several genes at dose levels relevant to natural solar exposure (35Tyrrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The solar UV radiation includes the wavelengths UVA, UVB, and UVC. The doses that reach the surface of the earth are composed of 90–99% UVA, 1–10% UVB, and a small fraction of UVC as a result of atmospheric ozone depletion (4Steidl M. Deleo V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The intensity of UVA and UVB in natural sunshine is such that an individual can receive as much as 1000 KJ/m2 and 10 KJ/m2 of radiations in a single day at the beach, respectively (4Steidl M. Deleo V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Also UVA has been shown to promote UVB carcinogenesis in animal experiments (4Steidl M. Deleo V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, the doses of UVB used in this study are relevant to natural solar exposure. Some UV-induced genes are believed to be regulated by an oxidative mechanism (35Tyrrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring free radicals typically include ROS and reactive nitrogen species (36Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). In addition to inducing cellular injury such as DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, free radicals also function as intracellular messengers (36Lander H.M.

Data are accumulating to indicate a vital role of ROS in mediating cellular responses to various extracellular stimuli (35Tyrrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 36Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 37Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). It has been reported that free radicals are involved in the production of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones in the activation of nuclear transcription factors, gene transcription, neuromodulation, and apoptosis (35Tyrrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 36Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 37Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). For example, it has been reported that the generation of H2O2is required for platelet-derived growth factor signal transduction (38Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that increased levels of intracellular H2O2 and Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 were detected upon exposure of cells to UV radiation. Pretreatment of cells withN-acetyl-l-cyteine or catalase prevented the increase in H2O2 and resulted in an inhibition of UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308. These data suggest that UV radiation can generate a high level of H2O2 in cultured cells, and this UV-generated H2O2 plays an essential role in UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308. It may be noted that UV-induced ROS peaks appear from 7 to 20 min, whereas UV-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 occurs at 30 min and reaches the maximum at 4–7 h after cells were exposed to UV radiation. The lag time of Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 as compared with ROS generation suggests that H2O2 initiates the Akt phosphorylation through indirect pathways. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that the pretreatment of cells with the PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, or expression of dominant negative p85 prevents the H2O2-induced Akt activation (33Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). It has been reported that physiologic stimuli are capable of inducing Akt kinase activity involving PI3-kinase (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). PI3-kinase-generated phospholipids act by multiple mechanisms that cooperate to regulate Akt activation (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). One of them is through the direct binding of phosphoinositides to the Akt pleckstrin homology domain (39James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R. Grove S.J. Holmes A.B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 40Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A.

Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 42Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

A consequence of Akt binding by phospholipids is the translocation of Akt from the cytoplasm to the inner of the plasma membrane (43Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 44Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This translocation is necessary for the activation of Akt, because c-Akt is constitutively activated when it is specifically targeted to the inner surface of the plasma membrane (44Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Akt activity is regulated by phosphorylation (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar, 26Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). There are four phosphorylation sites identified including Ser-124, Thr-450, Thr-308, and Ser-473 (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar, 26Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have suggested that the phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 is required for Akt activity (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar, 26Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar), whereas Ser-124 and Thr-450 appear to be basally phosphorylated (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar, 26Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Because the kinases that phosphorylate Akt are PI3,4,5P-dependent, they were termed 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinases (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). The second mechanism by which phospholipids regulate Akt activation is by regulating the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1/protein kinase C-related protein kinase-2 complex, which can phosphorylate Akt at both Thr-308 and Ser-473 (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). Some studies have indicated that binding of phospholipids to the Akt pleckstrin homology domain induces a critical conformational change that renders Akt competent for phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinases (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that Akt could be activated in a PI3-kinase-independent manner (43Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 44Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). An agonist of the protein kinase A pathway can activate Akt by increasing cytoplasmic calcium levels (43Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 44Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The increased calcium binds to calmodulin, and the Ca2+/calmodulin complex activates the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase, which then activates Akt by directly phosphorylating Akt at Thr-308 (45Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The results in the present study demonstrate that UV radiation led to increases in Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308. Although the details of the molecular mechanism for involvement of signal transduction pathways are not clear, the role of protein kinase A and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase in H2O2-mediated Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 by UV radiation need to be studied further. This hypothesis is supported by our previous findings that UV radiation induced rapid increase of intracellular free calcium and transactivation of nuclear factor of activated T cells, which is believed to depend on Ca2+/calmodulin complex formation and activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (46Huang C. Mattjus P. Ma W.-Y. Rincon M. Chen N.Y. Brown R.E. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9143-9149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The identification of Akt as a key regulator of cellular survival has been associated with current models of oncogenesis. A number of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that function upstream of Akt have been found to affect cancer development by regulating Akt activity (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). The cells transformed by v-PI3-kinase exhibit constitutive Akt activation, and the transfection of such cells with dominant negative Akt can revert oncogenic transformation (47Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 276: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 48Aoki M. Batista O. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14950-14955Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of bone marrow precursors with kinase-inactive Akt suppresses the ability of wild-type Bcr/Abl to promote leukemogenesis in vivo (49Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Martinez R. Choi J.K. Trotta R. Wlodarski P. Perrotti D. Chan T.O. Wasik M.A. Tsichlis P.N. Calabretta B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6151-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type Akt may also cause oncogenesis (50Bellacosa A. de Feo D. Godwin A.K. Bell D.W. Cheng J.Q. Altomare D.A. Wan M.H. Dubeau L. Scambia G. Masciullo V. Ferrandina G. Panici P.B. Mancuso S. Neri G. Testa J.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 64: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 51Cheng J.Q. Ruggeri B. Klein W.M. Sonoda G. Altomare D.A. Watson D.K. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3636-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). A large number of studies has demonstrated that transfection of a variety of cell types with constitutively active Akt blocks apoptosis induced by apoptotic stimuli such as UV radiation, DNA damage, and the anti-fas antibody (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). This is one of the mechanisms by which Akt plays a role in promoting oncogenesis. Akt may also mediate tumor promotion by inducing cell cycle progression (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). In light of the role of Akt in oncogenesis and tumor promotion and considering the activation of Akt by UV radiation, it is reasonable to hypothesize that UV-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308 may play an important role in the promotor effects of UV in skin cancer development. In summary, UV radiation generates ROS and induces the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308. Among ROS generated by UV radiation, H2O2 is responsible for the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308. Considering the important role of Akt in oncogenesis, the present study suggests that H2O2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308 in UV responses may play a role in UV-induced carcinogenesis. It should be noted that by using ESR spin trapping and fluorescence staining, the present study has shown that exposure of cells to UV radiation generates a whole spectrum of ROS including H2O2, ⋅OH, and O⨪2. Because these ROS are reported to be involved in many biological effects and signal transduction pathways, it is reasonable to speculate that many of the biological responses to UV exposure such as DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and the induction of apoptosis and transcriptional activation may be mediated by ROS.

We have previously identified a member of this receptor family in the stomach and have demonstrated that it is localized to the parietal cell, the acid secretory cell of the gastric gland. The activation of acid secretion has been classically defined as being regulated by two pathways: a neuronal pathway (mediated by acetylcholine) and an endocrine pathway (mediated by gastrin and histamine). Here, we identified a novel pathway modulating gastric acid secretion through the stomach calcium-sensing receptor (SCAR) located on the basolateral membrane of gastric parietal cells. Activation of SCAR in the intact rat gastric gland by divalent cations (Ca2+ or Mg2+) or by the potent stimulator gadolinium (Gd3+) led to an increase in the rate of acid secretion through the apical H+,K+-ATPase. Gd3+ was able to activate acid secretion through the omeprazole-sensitive H+,K+-ATPase even in the absence of the classical stimulator histamine. In contrast, inhibition of SCAR by reduction of extracellular cations abolished the stimulatory effect of histamine on gastric acid secretion, providing evidence for the regulation of the proton secretory transport protein by the receptor. These studies present the first example of a member of the divalent cation receptors modulating a plasma membrane transport protein and may lead to new insights into the regulation of gastric acid secretion.

In the endocrine pathway, release of gastrin from antral G cells leads to the activation of histamine-containing enterochromaffin-like (ECL)1cells (1Hersey S.J. Sachs G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 155-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). ECL cells then release histamine, which in turn initiates the direct insertion and activation of H+,K+-ATPase into the apical membrane of parietal cells. The exposure to histamine also causes a simultaneous rise in intracellular Ca2+. Elevations in intracellular Ca2+ during this period have been associated with increased acid secretion and, as a result, have been used as an additional marker of the secretory process (2Geibel J. Abraham R. Modlin I. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1060-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3Sachs J. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 22-37PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chew C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: G814-G823PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a direct correlation between activation of the divalent cation receptor and Ca2+ entry into parietal cells has been established in which activation of the receptor by either divalent or trivalent ions leads to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ both from intra- and extracellular sites (5Cheng I. Qureshi I. Chattopadhyh N. Qureshi A. Butters R.S. Hall A.E. Cima R.R. Rogers K.V. Hebert S.C. Geibel J.P. Brown E.M. Soybel D.I. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 118-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the divalent receptor has been shown to modulate membrane Ca2+ channels and intracellular Ca2+levels in G cells of the stomach (5Cheng I. Qureshi I. Chattopadhyh N. Qureshi A. Butters R.S. Hall A.E. Cima R.R. Rogers K.V. Hebert S.C. Geibel J.P. Brown E.M. Soybel D.I. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 118-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recently, using calcium receptor-transfected human embryonic kidney cells, the first demonstration of calcium receptor modulation of a channel protein and an intracellular Ca2+ pathway was made (6Hofer A.M. Curci S. Doble M.A. Brown E.M. Soybel D.I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After activation of parietal cells by histamine, acid secretion occurs and the luminal pH of the gland decreases to approximately pH 1, leading to the efflux of protons from the gland lumen and resulting in a subsequent decrease in intragastric pH. However, during this massive flux of protons the intracellular pH of parietal cells remains stable at approximately pH 7 (3Sachs J. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 22-37PubMed Google Scholar, 7Paradiso A. Townsley M. Wenzl E. Machen T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C554-C561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Any alteration in this regulatory acid secretory feedback loop leads to cell and tissue destruction and therefore has to be tightly regulated. Two methods are commonly employed to counteract the overproduction of acid: (i) surgically, by elimination of the neuronal element (vagotomy) (8Boron J.H. Mt. Sinai J. Med. 2000; 67: 37-40PubMed Google Scholar) or (ii) pharmacologically, either through histamine 2 receptor antagonists (9Black J.W. Duncan W.A. Durant C.J. Ganellin C.R. Parsons E.M. Nature. 1972; 236: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar) or proton pump inhibitors (3Sachs J. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 22-37PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lindberg P. Brandstrom A. Wallmark B. Mattsson H. Rikner L. Hoffmann K.J. Med. Res. Rev. 1990; 10: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Fine-tuning of the acid-secreting mechanism is still not completely understood and remains an important target for therapies to modulate gastric acid secretion. The goal of the present study was to elucidate the physiological role of the stomach isoform of the calcium-sensing receptor (SCAR) on gastric acid secretion. We demonstrate that SCAR modulates acid secretion via regulation of the H+,K+-ATPase. Furthermore, this regulation of the transport protein appears to be independent of vesicular trafficking and the conventional hormonal pathways of acid secretion. Our studies present evidence for the first regulation of a membrane transport protein via a divalent cation receptor. Sprague Dawley rats, 150–250 g (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), were housed in climate- and humidity-controlled light-cycled rooms, fed standard rat chow, and allowed free access to water prior to investigation. Animals were killed with an overdose of pentobarbital, and the stomach was quickly removed. The fundus and antrum were isolated, sliced into 0.3-cm square sections, and washed several times in a standard, ice-cold, HEPES-buffered Ringer's solution (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 32.2 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4 at 37 °C) to remove residual food particles. The tissues were then transferred to the stage of a dissecting microscope. Individual glands were isolated using a hand dissection technique as described previously (11Waisbren S.J. Geibel J. Boron W.F. Modlin I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1013-C1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, the glands were allowed to adhere to coverslips precoated with Cell-Tak (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) and transferred to a thermostatically controlled chamber maintained at 37 °C on either a laser confocal microscope or on a video imaging system for the duration of the experiment. Isolated gastric glands were incubated in a HEPES-buffered Ringer's solution containing 10 µm2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF)-acetomethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 10 min. After loading, the chamber was flushed with Ringer's solution to remove de-esterfied dye. The perfusion chamber was mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IMT2) used in the epifluorescence mode with a ×40 objective. Following loading, the dye BCECF was successively excited at 440 nm and 490 nm and the resultant fluorescent signal was monitored at 535 nm using an intensified charge-coupled device camera. Data points were acquired every 8 s. The 490/440 intensity ratio data were converted to intracellular pH (pHi) values using the high K+/nigericin calibration technique (12Singh S.K. Binder H.J. Geibel J.P. Boron W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11573-11577Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Over the pH range of 6.5–7.5, fluorescence varied in a linear fashion with extracellular pH. Data are expressed as ΔpH/min. Acid extrusion was monitored in the absence of bicarbonate as intracellular alkalinization after the removal of Na+ from the bath, which caused a reproducible and sustained intracellular acidification. Alkalinization rates (ΔpHi/min) for the calculation of Na+-independent pHi recovery (H+,K+-ATPase activity) and Na+-dependent pHi recovery (Na+/H+ exchanger activity) rates were measured in the range of pH 6.80–6.85 and 6.85–7.0, respectively. All measurements for a series were measured at the same initial pH to maintain a constant intracellular buffering power for the calculation of recovery rates. For intracellular Ca2+ measurements, 15 glands (n = 5 animals) were loaded with 10 µm of the Ca2+-sensing dye Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes) in the chamber for 10 min at room temperature. Glands were then washed for 2 min with standard HEPES-buffered Ringer's solution to eliminate residual de-esterfied dye from the bath. Fluorescence was monitored with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 535 nm using a multiline argon laser coupled to the confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 410). The fluorescence intensity was determined by measuring pixel values over each cell of interest before and after superfusion with 100 µm gastrin, 100 µm histamine, or 1.0 mm Gd3+. Sequential frames were acquired at 2-s intervals, with each image comprising eight frames, on average. At least five parietal cells were analyzed in each experiment. Data were expressed in arbitrary fluorescence units (2Geibel J. Abraham R. Modlin I. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1060-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma; omeprazole was a kind gift from Astra Hässle AB, Mölndal, Sweden and was acid-activated prior to application to the glands. Activation of acid secretion via histamine stimulation was induced by preincubation of the glands for 15 min prior to the experiment. All data were summarized as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by grouping measurements at baseline values and during experimental periods. Significance was determined using an unpaired Student's t test withp < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. High resolution video microscopy as well as laser confocal microscopy were employed to detect fluorochromic intensity changes within parietal cells in freshly isolated rat gastric glands. Measurements of acid secretion were conducted using the pHi-sensitive dye BCECF to allow for a continuous online monitoring of pHi during acid secretion. Changes in pHiallowed us to observe activation or inhibition of the H+,K+-ATPase under resting as well as under stimulated conditions. We used several experimental approaches to test the decisive role of SCAR in gastric acid secretion. Challenging the cells with an acid load while inhibiting Na+/H+exchange activity in the absence of bicarbonate allowed us to investigate only the apical H+,K+-ATPase as the sole H+ extrusion pathway. In the absence of histamine, no stimulation (Na+-independent proton efflux) was observed (data not shown). Histamine (100 µm) exposure induced an alkalinization rate of 0.025 ± 0.001 pH unit/min. Fig.1shows that this recovery was completely inhibited by specific inhibitors of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase, either omeprazole (−0.001 ± 0.001 pH unit/min) (10Lindberg P. Brandstrom A. Wallmark B. Mattsson H. Rikner L. Hoffmann K.J. Med. Res. Rev. 1990; 10: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) or SCH 28080 (Schering; −0.001 ± 0.001 pH unit/min) (13Swarts H.P. Klaassen C.H. De Pont J.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the observed alkalinization was due to H+ extrusion via the H+,K+-ATPase. Omeprazole or SCH 28080 had no effect on the pHi of resting glands (data not shown). Figs. 2and3a illustrate the effects of divalent ions on either the activation or the inhibition of H+,K+-ATPase activity via SCAR. Reduction of extracellular divalent cations (100 µm Ca2+, 0 mm Mg2+) effectively abolished histamine-induced alkalinization (−0.001 ± 0.001 pH unit/min). However, as shown in Fig. 3 a, the trivalent cation Gd3+ stimulated H+,K+-ATPase activity both in the absence or presence of histamine and in the presence of low cations (100 µm Ca2+, 0 mm Mg2+) as shown by an increase in the rate of alkalinization (0.035 ± 0.004 pH unit/min). The stimulatory effect of Gd3+ was not mediated by the release of histamine from adjacent ECL cells, inasmuch as the H2 receptor inhibitor cimetidine (100 µm) did not influence the effect of Gd3+ (0.038 ± 0.012 pH unit/min, Fig.3 b). However, inhibition of the H+,K+-ATPase by omeprazole abolished Gd3+-induced alkalinization (−0.001 ± 0.002 pH unit/min), demonstrating that proton extrusion through the H+,K+-ATPase was indeed responsible for the effect of Gd3+ (Fig. 3 a). The onset of the Gd3+-induced alkalinization occurred within 1–2 min after application, suggesting activation of H+,K+-ATPase pumps that were already inserted in the membrane. In addition, Fig. 2, a and bsummarize the concentration dependence for both Ca2+ and Mg2+, showing the activation and inhibition kinetics for SCAR on the basolateral membrane. By varying the level of total extracellular divalent ions, we could activate or inhibit the alkalinizing ability of the H+,K+-ATPase in parietal cells previously stimulated with histamine.Figure 3Mechanisms of SCAR-mediated alkalinization. a and b, stimulation of H+,K+-ATPase activity with the divalent cation receptor agonist Gd3+ in the presence of both normal (1 mm Ca2+, 1.2 mm Mg2+) and reduced cations (100 µm Ca2+, 0 mm Mg2+). The effect of Gd3+ was not prevented by the histamine receptor type 2 antagonist cimetidine (1 mm) but was completely abolished by the H+,K+-ATPase inhibitor omeprazole (100 µm). This demonstrates that histamine release from adjacent ECL cells was not responsible for the activation of the H+,K+-ATPase and that the intracellular alkalinization was due to H+,K+-ATPase activity. c, effect of histamine in the presence of normal cations (1 mm Ca2+, 1.2 mmMg2+) and reduced cations (100 µmCa2+, 0 mm Mg2+) on intracellular Ca2+ levels.

Similar to our previous experiments with pHi, the calcium response was inhibited by reducing total extracellular divalent ions (100 µm Ca2+, 0 mmMg2+) even in the presence of histamine (Fig.3 c). Our data demonstrate that SCAR is potentially important for the active secretion of gastric acid. Moreover, this receptor may modulate the conventional stimulatory hormonal pathways inasmuch as activation or inhibition of SCAR resulted in either an immediate activation or cessation of acid secretion (even in the presence of histamine), respectively. These studies suggest a possible mechanism for the tight regulation of pHi of the parietal cell, a feature that has not been clearly defined in the classical model of acid secretion. The modulation of transporter activity via SCAR may provide a mechanism for maintaining pHi during acid secretion. Despite the massive proton extrusion across the apical membrane that triggers a sharp decrease in luminal pH, pHi remains almost constant during this stimulatory phase (7Paradiso A. Townsley M. Wenzl E. Machen T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C554-C561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process requires simultaneous activation and inhibition of various transport moieties, such as the Na+/H+-exchanger (15Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yun C.H. Tse C.M. Nath S.K. Levine S.A. Brant S.R. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G1-G11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the Cl−/HCO3−-exchanger, as well as the recently described Na+/HCO3co-transporter (17Caroppo R. Schmitt B.M. Boron W.F. Geibel J.P. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: G4635Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18Rossmann H. Bachmann O. Vieillard-Baron D. Gregor M. Seidler U. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 1389-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Modulation of Na+/H+activity by SCAR was observed in this study but requires further investigation to elucidate its effects during histamine-regulated acid secretion in the presence of divalent ions. Accordingly, SCAR could potentially up- or down-regulate a variety of transporters on both the apical and basolateral membranes simultaneously to control acid secretion while preserving intracellular ion homeostasis. This tight control of both membranes would allow for the sustained flow of protons and Cl− across the apical membrane while maintaining pHi by either up- or down-regulating the remaining acid regulatory transporters on the basolateral and apical membrane. It should be pointed out that during the present studies we used a new method to assay directly for proton efflux, measuring pHi after an acid load. This protocol allowed us to create an acid gradient from cell to lumen by removing Na+ from the basolateral perfusate and to eliminate the regulatory role of the Na+/H+ exchanger. We then monitored the efflux of protons (rate of alkalinization) via the Na+-independent, omeprazole-sensitive H+,K+-ATPase. Although removal of Na+ could result in a potential rise in intracellular Ca2+ (19Negulescu P.A. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G770-G778PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of H+,K+-ATPase, we demonstrate in our studies instead that removal or addition of extracellular divalent ions appeared to be the trigger for acid secretion. Removal of Na+ in non-histamine-stimulated glands in the presence or absence of divalent ions failed to activate acid secretion, whereas addition of Gd3+ caused an increase in acid secretion even at low levels of extracellular Ca2+. As the effects on acid secretion elicited by SCAR appear to be linked to the levels of extracellular divalent or trivalent ions, we suggest that this important regulatory pathway may even overcome the histamine-related stimulation of acid secretion. Moreover, SCAR could play an important role linking gastric acid secretion to the metabolic state. Modulation of Ca2+-sensing receptors by amino acids has recently been reported and could provide the link between protein intake and gastric acid secretion (20Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 25: 4814-4819Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Similarly, hypercalcemia as a result of malignancy or hyperparathyroidism is accompanied by increased gastric acid secretion via a process that remains unidentified (21Wise S.R. Quigley M. Saxe A.W. Zdon M.J. Surgery. 1990; 108: 1058-1063PubMed Google Scholar). SCAR could indeed regulate not only direct Ca2+ reabsorption but could at the same time lead to changes in the proton extrusion rates along the gastric glands, which has profound influences on intestinal Ca2+ absorption and whole body calcium content (22Favus M.J. Bushinsky D.A. Coe F.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G695-G700PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of interactions of SCAR with proton efflux and cell ionic homeostasis suggest that divalent cation receptors may accomplish the regulation of total body Ca2+ homeostasis by interactions of the receptor with ion transporters or channels on the cell membranes. This feedback regulation could allow the divalent cation receptors to modulate Ca2+ reabsorption by varying the rate of proton efflux from the cell, which in turn would influence ionized Ca2+ levels."

CO oxidation occurs at the C-center, and the B-center mediates the transfer of electrons from the C-center to external electron acceptors (5Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A nickel-deficient apoCODH, which contains all of the iron clusters of holoCODH yet no CO-oxidation activity, is obtained by growing wild-type R. rubrum on nickel-depleted medium (6Bonam D. McKenna M.C. Stephens P.J. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The apoCODH can be activated both in vivo and in vitro by the addition of nickel (6Bonam D. McKenna M.C. Stephens P.J. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The basic studies on CO-dependent growth (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 63Ni transport (12Watt R.K. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4554-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that three accessory proteins encoded bycooCTJ genes are involved in nickel incorporation into a nickel site. The cooT gene encodes a 7.1-kDa protein that shows marginal similarity to chaperone-type HypC protein required for the maturation of hydrogenase from Escherichia coli (13Magalon A. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21114-21120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cooJ gene encodes a soluble, 12.6-kDa protein that has a histidine-rich nickel-binding domain. CooJ has been purified by IMAC from R. rubrum and has been shown to bind 4 Ni2+atoms per apparent 19-kDa monomer with a Kd of 4.3 µm (14Watt R.K. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10019-10025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A mutant lacking a functional cooC gene requires a 1,000-fold higher nickel concentration than wild-type strain for CO-dependent anaerobic growth (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The elevated nickel requirement of the cooC mutant suggests that CooC is required for the production of enzymatically active CODH in vivo at normal levels of nickel in the medium. Significantly, CooC has a P-loop (15Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4255) Google Scholar) that is indicative of nucleotide binding in many proteins including HypB and UreG which play a role in nickel processing for hydrogenase (16Maier T. Lottspeich F. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and urease (17Moncrief M.B.C. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4081-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), respectively. CooC also shows homology to NifH, which functions in the ATP-dependent insertion of FeMo-co into apodinitrogenase (18Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To gain information about the function of CooC in the insertion of nickel into CODH and insight into the nickel center maturation, we purified CooC and characterized its biochemical properties. A mutant form of CooC in which lysine 13 of the P-loop was replaced by glutamine was obtained by site-specific mutagenesis of the cooC gene. The K13Q CooC was unable to hydrolyze ATP in vitro, and a mutant strain that expresses K13Q CooC accumulated the catalytically inactive, nickel-deficient CODH. Nickel-dependent activation of apoCODH in the presence of nucleotides was tested to provide evidence that CooC couples ATP hydrolysis with nickel insertion into R. rubrum CODH. Metal-free MOPS (100 mm, pH 7.5), TE (100 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and phosphate (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5) buffers were prepared by passage through a column of Chelex-100 cation-exchange resin (Bio-Rad) and used in protein purification, enzyme assays, and nickel activation assays. All purification steps and assays were performed under anaerobic conditions using a buffer containing 1 mm sodium dithionite or in a Vacuum Atmosphere anaerobic glove box (Hawthorne, CA model HE-493). The genotypes of strains employed in this study were UR2 (wild type), UR445 (Δ(cooFSCTJA)10::aacC1Ω), UR469 (cooC16::aacC1Ωlinker), UR471 (ΔcooJ18), UR479 (cooT19::linker), UR495 (cooC20::linker), and UR501 (cooJ23::aac1Ωlinker) (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains were cultured, depending upon experiments, in nickel-depleted or nickel-supplemented medium according to published procedures (6Bonam D. McKenna M.C. Stephens P.J. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,7Ensign S.A. Campbell M.J. Ludden P.W.

The mutant producing K13Q CooC was constructed as follows. A 0.56-kilobase pairHindIII-PstI fragment was isolated from pCO39 inE. coli strain UQ1155 (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned intoHindIII-PstI digested pBSKS. The resulting plasmid was termed pLJC3 and used as a template. Two mutagenic primers were designed to convert Lys-13 codon (AAG) to Gln (CAG) in thecooC gene by using a QuickChange (Stratagene) method. After mutagenesis, the mutation was verified by sequencing. The mutatedcooC gene was excised by HindIII-PstI and inserted into pCO39 digested with the same enzymes, and the resulting plasmid was termed pLJC5. A 4.5-kilobase pairKpnI-SacI fragment carryingcooS′C(K13Q cooC)TJAnadC′ from pLJC5 was excised and cloned into the mobilizable vector pUX19 (Kmr). This construct, in E. coli S17-1 (UQ324) (19Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5641) Google Scholar), was conjugated into R. rubrum UR447 (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J.

A 1.5-kilobase pairEcoRV fragment from pCO5 (E. coli UQ1193) (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), bearing coo′CTJA′ genes, was ligated intoXmnI-cut pMAL-c2 expression vector (New England Biolabs Inc.) and transformed into E. coli DH5α to generate strain UQ1430. This ligation created an in-frame fusion betweenmalE and coo′C, starting with codon 89 ofcooC, and the orientation and plasmid insert junctions were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and isolation of the fusion protein were performed by the manufacturer's protocol. Purified MalE-CooC fusion protein (32 mg) was digested with trypsin (48 µg) at 4 °C for 40 min. The CooC was separated by preparative SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide gel). After electrophoresis, the CooC band was excised, and the acrylamide fragment was washed three times with shaking for 10 min in 50 ml of distilled water and then minced through a syringe. The gel pieces were incubated 12 h in PBS buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation, supernatant was collected and reanalyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm that pure CooC was obtained. Antibodies to CooC were generated in rabbits at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School Animal Care Unit Polyclonal Antibody Service. Western blots of protein with anti-CooC antibodies were performed as described previously (20Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russel-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal.

Chromatophore membranes were treated with 50% (NH4)2SO4 with gentle stirring for 1 h in an anaerobic glove box. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet fraction was resuspended in TE buffer and subjected to 40% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended in TE buffer, and dialyzed twice against 4 liters of TE buffer containing 10% glycerol at 4 °C. After dialysis, membrane debris and dark red pigments were removed by centrifugation at 270,000 × g for 1 h. At this point, the CooC protein was solubilized in TE buffer. The dialyzed protein solution was applied to a Whatman DE52 column (2.5 × 18.5 cm) that had been packed and equilibrated with TE buffer. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of TE buffer and then proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–350 mm; 300 ml total volume) in TE buffer with a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min; fractions of 15 ml each were collected. CooC eluted from the DE52 column between 170 and 240 mm NaCl. Active fractions were combined, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 250 mm. The protein solution was loaded onto the first phenyl-Sepharose column (2.5 × 12.5 cm) equilibrated with TE buffer containing 250 mm of (NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with 120 ml of 250 mm(NH4)2SO4, and proteins were eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (from 250 to 0 mm) in TE buffer at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min; fractions of 10 ml each were collected. A second phenyl-Sepharose column (16 × 10 cm) was connected to an FPLC system and equilibrated with TE buffer containing 250 mm(NH4)2SO4. CooC-containing fractions from the first phenyl-Sepharose column were combined. After estimating the concentration of (NH4)2SO4 in the pooled fractions by measuring the conductivity, (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 250 mm, and the solution was loaded onto the second phenyl-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 60 ml of TE buffer containing 250 mm(NH4)2SO4, and proteins were eluted with a linear decreasing gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (250 to 0 mm) in TE buffer over 50 min with a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min; fractions of 10 ml were collected. CooC eluted from the phenyl-Sepharose column in buffer with 80 to 30 mm(NH4)2SO4. Fractions containing CooC were transferred anaerobically to a nitrogen-filled ultrafiltration kit (Amicon) equipped with XM50 membrane filter (Millipore). After desalting, the protein solution was recovered anaerobically. A hydroxylapatite column (10 × 10 cm) was connected to an FPLC system and equilibrated with TE buffer. Desalted protein solution was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was washed with 20 ml of TE buffer, after which a linear gradient from TE buffer to phosphate buffer was applied at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min over 50 min; fractions of 15 ml each were collected. CooC eluted between 10 and 15 mmNaH2PO4 from the hydroxylapatite column. Finally, a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HR 5/5, 0.8 ml) was equilibrated with TE buffer. The active fractions from the hydroxylapatite column were applied to the Mono Q column. The column was washed with 20 ml of TE buffer, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–300 mm) in TE buffer over 30 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and fractions of 1 ml were collected. CooC eluted from the Mono Q column between 170 and 190 mmNaCl. NaCl was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 using TE buffer, and purified CooC was kept in liquid nitrogen for further studies. The same procedures were applied to purify K13Q CooC.

Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the modified method of Hedrick and Smith (28Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Purified CooC sample was desalted with ZipTipc18 (Millipore) according to manufacturer's protocol and was analyzed by MALDI-MS using a Shimadzu Kratos Kompact MALDI 4, version 5.0.1 mass spectrometer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. FPLC gel filtration was also performed anaerobically using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. CooC was eluted from the column with a TE buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid to concentrate CooC for SDS-PAGE analysis (29Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with anti-CooC antibodies was performed on all fractions to detect CooC. UV-visible spectra of purified CooC anaerobically sealed in quartz cuvettes were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1601PC spectrometer. Dithionite was separated from CooC by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 prior to recording the spectra. The concentration of CooC was 0.1 mg/ml in TE buffer. Metal contents of CooC and CODH were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at the University of Georgia Chemical Analysis Laboratory. Nucleotide triphosphatase activities of wild type and K13Q CooC were analyzed by determining the release of γ-32P from [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]GTP (5,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The assay solution consisted of 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithionite in a total volume of 50 µl, unless noted otherwise. To determine the Km and Vmaxvalues, [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]GTP were diluted to 2,000–3,000 cpm/pmol in 500 µm of ATP and GTP, respectively. The concentration of purified CooC in each reaction was 0.2 µm (0.62 µg). Reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate and carried out at 37 °C. After 10 min, triplicate 15-µl aliquots were analyzed using a charcoal precipitation method (30Brandt D.R. Asano T. Petersen S.E. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4357-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All the vials used for nickel incorporation experiments were soaked in 4 n HCl for a day, and then rinsed with metal-free distilled water and MOPS buffer before use. In vivo nickel incorporation was analyzed by a CO-dependent, methyl viologen reduction assay (3Bonam D. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2980-2987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro nickel activation was performed with the modification of the published methods (6Bonam D. McKenna M.C. Stephens P.J. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Ensign S.A. Campbell M.J. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2162-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). R. rubrum cells were grown on nickel-depleted malate-ammonium (MN) medium (70 ml) in stoppered glass vials (100 ml). Cultures were grown in the light to anA600 of 2.0 and then induced with bubbling of CO to the medium. When A600 reached 4.5, cells were collected by centrifugation of the culture (50 ml), disrupted by osmotic shock (31Ludden P.W. Burris R.H. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and resuspended in MOPS buffer (5 ml). Nickel activation was initiated by mixing the cell extract (0.5 ml, 1.82 mg of total protein) with CO-saturated MOPS buffer (4.5 ml) containing 0.5 mm NiCl2, 0.2 mmmethyl viologen, and 5.0 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm nucleotides. Reactions were performed at 25 °C. Every 10 min, a 10-µl aliquot of the activation mixture was taken and assayed for CO-dependent methyl viologen reduction. The specific activity of CODH was expressed as micromoles of CO oxidized/min/mg protein. Assay data represent the average of three independent determinations. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (32Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18643) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the effects of Ni2+concentration in the growth medium on extractable CODH activity in various mutants. The R. rubrum strains were grown in non-metal-chelexed SMN medium to prevent Ni2+ toxicity that inhibits cell growth at high Ni2+ concentrations (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even without addition of Ni2+, wild-type (UR2) strain showed considerable CODH activity (38 µmol/min/mg). This activity level indicates that the Ni2+ insertion system is so efficient that wild-type cells can utilize the contaminating Ni2+present in the SMN medium. Addition of an increasing concentration of Ni2+ to a wild-type culture resulted in an increase in CODH activity, and activity was saturated at 50 µm of Ni2+ with a maximum activity of 110 µmol/min/mg protein. For cooT nonpolar (UR479) and cooJ polar (UR501) mutants, the CODH activity was increased as the medium Ni2+concentration increased, but specific activities were only 40–50% of wild-type activity at all Ni2+ concentrations. The activity of UR471, which has a deletion in the portion of the cooJgene that encodes the polyhistidine tail, was also about 41% of wild-type activity but was not significantly affected by Ni2+ concentrations. This result confirms the previous observation that the polyhistidine domain of CooJ is dispensable (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A drastic reduction in CODH activity was observed in all strains containing mutations in the cooC gene. As the Ni2+ concentration increased from 25 to 700 µm, the activity of cooC polar mutant (UR469) was increased from 6.3 to 36% of wild-type activity. The CO oxidation activity of cooC nonpolar mutant (UR495) lacking functional CooC was very low regardless of the medium Ni2+ level. Even at high concentrations of Ni2+, none of the strains lackingcooCTJ exhibited CODH activity at the level of wild-type strain. Because the coo operon proteins do not function in nickel transport (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Watt R.K. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4554-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results clearly implicate the CooC, CooT, and CooJ proteins in the nickel-dependent maturation of CODH. To further study CooC and its role in nickel insertion, the CooC protein was purified. CooC was identified and localized by SDS-PAGE and Western blots. CooC was observed in the chromatophore membrane fraction of UR2 (wild type) cells grown under CO-inducing conditions as an immunoreactive band migrating at a molecular mass of 28 kDa (Fig.2A). But it was detected neither in the membrane or soluble fraction of UR2 grown under non-CO-inducing conditions nor in extracts from UR445 lackingcooCTJ genes (data not shown). The mutant form of CooC (K13Q) was also observed in the membrane fraction of UR871 grown in the presence of CO (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate that CooC is a CO-inducible membrane protein. Prior to CooC purification, extraction efficiencies of reagents were tested to characterize the nature of association with membrane. Membranes were treated with solutions containing the following salts or detergents, and solubilized CooC was then separated from treated membranes by ultracentrifugation. The yield and purity of solubilized CooC are given in parentheses: 0.5m NaCl (27.7 and 0.53%); 2.0 m NaCl (65.3 and 0.44%); alkaline treatment with 100 mmNa2CO3 buffer at pH 11.3 (71.2 and 0.40%); 30% (NH4)2SO4 (63.8 and 0.47%); 50% (NH4)2SO4 (80.4 and 0.38%); 70% (NH4)2SO4 (86.5 and 0.25%); Triton X-100 (62.6 and 0.33%); and CHAPS (82.1 and 0.30%). Treatment of the membrane fraction with 50% (NH4)2SO4 saturation was selected based upon a compromise between yield and purity. Since CooC can be released by mild extraction methods such as high salt concentration or alkaline treatment, it seems likely that CooC is not an integral protein. This is consistent with the hydropathy analysis that CooC is a moderately hydrophobic protein with no transmembrane segments (11Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the proteins from various steps of purification. About 65% of total membrane proteins were extracted by 50% (NH4)2SO4 with a wide range of molecular weights. CooC was enriched by 40% (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. Western blot with anti-CODH antibodies and CODH activity assays of DE52 fractions showed that CooC co-eluted with CODH and CooF from the DE52 column. Two consecutive hydrophobic phenyl-Sepharose columns successfully separated the major membrane proteins such as CODH and CooF from CooC. CooF eluted when washing the column with 250 mm (NH4)2SO4 and CooC eluted between 80 and 30 mm(NH4)2SO4; CODH remained bound tightly on the hydrophobic column. After the second hydrophobic column, CooC appeared as a major protein (Fig. 2C, lane 7). Further purification with hydroxylapatite (lane 8) and Mono Q columns (lane 9) provided homogeneous CooC as shown inlane 9 of Fig. 2C. The purification resulted in a 3,464-fold overall purification with a 0.8% recovery. The mutant form of K13Q CooC was purified with reduced yield (0.6%) and purity (87%) from the UR871 cells grown under CO-inducing conditions. The wild-type CooC and K13Q CooC migrated to the same position in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

Open table in a new tab The Ni2+ content of CooC was analyzed to be less than 0.1 atom per dimer. Fe2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ were not detected. In order to test the nickel binding ability of CooC, Ni2+ was added into a CooC solution, and unbound Ni2+ was removed by a Sephadex G-25 gel column. The content of Ni2+ in the Ni2+-treated CooC was less than 0.1 atom per dimer, demonstrating that CooC does not bind Ni2+ tightly under the conditions tested. In SDS-polyacrylamide gels, purified CooC migrated at 29 kDa (Fig.2C, lane 9). MALDI-MS spectrum recorded the molecular mass of CooC as 28.9 kDa. These values are ∼1 kDa larger than the DNA sequence-deduced molecular mass of 27.8 kDa. The data can be explained by either of two possibilities: 1)"

LRP, like all members of the LDL receptor gene family, consists of five common structural units: 1) clusters of ligand binding cysteine-rich repeats; 2) epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor like cysteine-rich repeats; 3) YWTD domains; 4) a single membrane-spanning segment; and 5) a cytoplasmic tail that harbors two NPXY motifs. The ligand binding regions in LRP occur in four clusters (clusters I-IV) containing between 2 and 11 individual ligand binding repeats.

This molecule is a 40–42-amino acid peptide that is the prominent component of senile plaques (15Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

At the same time, the Aβ peptide binds avidly to LRP ligands, especially α2M and the activated form of the molecule (termed α2M*). LRP-mediated clearance of the α2M*·Aβ complex contributes to a reduction in Aβ levels (14Kang D.E. Pietrzik C.U. Baum L. Chevallier N. Merriam D.E. Kounnas M.Z. Wagner S.L. Troncoso J.C. Kawas C.H.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Not only does α2M* appear to mediate clearance of the Aβ peptide, but the association of α2M* with LRP on neurons also leads to an influx of calcium via N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (12Bacskai B.J.

To delineate further the contribution of LRP to pathological processes such as Alzheimer's disease, it will be important to define the structural basis for the α2M* interaction with LRP to assist in the development of specific inhibitors of this process. Defining regions within LRP responsible for α2M* binding has proven to be difficult, and conflicting studies have been reported (4Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G.

To accomplish this, we identified the binding sites on LRP for two inhibitors of α2M* uptake, monoclonal antibody 8G1 and an amino-terminal fragment of RAP (RAP D1D2). The studies indicate that the cooperation of ligand binding repeats from both cluster I and II is required for the high affinity binding of α2M* to LRP. LRP was isolated from human placenta as described by Ashcom et al. (22Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J.

Pro-urokinase provided by Jack Henkin (Abbott Laboratories) was activated by incubation with plasmin-Sepharose, and high molecular weight urokinase (uPA) was purified over a benzamadine-Sepharose column. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) was generously provided by Dan Lawrence (American Red Cross). R2629, a rabbit polyclonal IgG against LRP, was affinity purified over LRP-Sepharose as described (10Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. Fitzgerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol.

Microtiter wells were coated with LRP (10 µg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 100 µl/well) overnight and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. 5 nm125I-α2M* was added to the wells in the absence or presence of the indicated antibody (300 µg/ml) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After incubation the microtiter wells were washed and counted. Nonspecific binding was measured in presence of 1 µm RAP and subtracted. cDNA of human LRP (13Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I.

To generate expression vectors for the soluble fragments of LRP a commercial plasmid pSecTagB (Invitrogen) was utilized. The plasmid contains Ig k-chain leader sequence to ensure the secretion of expressed protein. cDNAs encoding selected portions of LRP (see Fig. 3) were produced by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pSecTagB using HindIII and XhoI sites in the case of sLRP1, sLRP1a, and sLRP1b. BamHI and XhoI sites were used for subcloning of sLRP2, sLRP3, and sLRP4 fragments. sLRP1 encodes amino acids 1–172 of mature LRP peptide. The other fragments used in this study contain the following amino acid sequences of LRP: sLRP1a, 1–786; sLRP1b, 1–955; sLRP2, 787–1244; sLRP3, 2462–3004; sLRP4, 3274–3843. Recombinant proteins sLRP1, sLRP1a, and sLRP1b contain extra 13 amino acids (AAQPARRARRTKL) encoded by a polylinker sequence at their amino terminus. SLRP2, sLRP3, and sLRP4 contain 19 amino acids (AAQPARRARRTKLGTELGS) encoded by a polylinker sequence. All soluble LRP fragments have a myc epitope and polyhistidine tag at the carboxyl terminus for detection. The construction of cDNAs for the mini-receptors is illustrated in Fig.4. First, a polymerase chain reaction product that encodes the entire region from after the cluster IV of ligand binding domains to the carboxyl terminus of LRP (residues 3844–4525) was subcloned into theXhoI and XbaI sites of pSecTagB. This plasmid was designated pSecTagLC (light chain). Then, cDNA encoding the selected portion of LRP containing ligand binding repeats was inserted into pSecTagLC using HindIII and XhoI sites for mini-receptors mLRP1 and mLRP1b or BamHI and XhoI sites for mLRP2, mLRP3, and mLRP4.Figure 4Recombinant mini-receptors used in the α2M* binding studies.A, schematic representation of mini LRPs shown in the comparison to the full-length endogenous LRP.

Cells growing in 100-mm dishes (∼50% confluence) were transfected in serum-containing medium with 30 µg of pSecTagB carrying cDNA for various LRP fragments. Cells were washed 24 h after transfection, and the medium was changed for plain Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% Nutridoma®-NS medium supplement (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This medium was harvested after 48 h of incubation, subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-myc antibody to detect recombinant proteins, and used in further experiments. LRP mini-receptors were expressed in CHO 13-5-1 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as follows. Cells were plated in six-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) 24 h prior to the transfection. Transfections were performed using 2 µg of DNA/well in 1.5 ml of serum-containing medium. 36–40 h after the beginning of transfection cells were washed and used in the ligand internalization experiments. Cellular internalization and degradation assays were generally conducted as described previously (24Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Human foreskin fibroblasts were seeded into 12-well culture dishes (5 × 104 cells/well) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin for 2 days. Cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h before the assay. 0.4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and various antibodies at selected concentrations was added to the corresponding wells and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Then125I-labeled α2M* was added to each well (2 nm final concentration). After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and detached from plastic using 0.5 mg/ml trypsin, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, and 5 mm EDTA-containing buffer. Internalized125I-α2M* was defined as radioactivity associated with the cell pellet. Nonspecific uptake of125I-α2M* was determined in the presence of 1 µm RAP and was subtracted from the total internalization. The cell numbers for each experimental condition were measured in parallel wells that did not contain radioactivity to ensure that antibodies did not cause cell detachment during treatment. CHO 13-5-1 cells (25Fitzgerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) transiently transfected with mini-LRP constructs were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 125I-labeled ligands at the concentrations indicated in each experiment, and cellular internalization was measured as described above. Nonspecific internalization of 125I-labeled IgG was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled antibody. Nonspecific internalization of125I-α2M* and 125I-labeled fragments of RAP was determined in the presence of 1 µmRAP. To estimate the relative amount of different mini-receptors on the cell surface, transfected CHO 13-5-1 cells were first chilled on ice for 1 h and then incubated with ice-cold medium containing 20 nm125I-labeled monoclonal antibody 5A6. After incubation for 2 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and detached from the plastic wells using 0.5 mg/ml trypsin, 0.05 mg/ml proteinase K, and 5 mm EDTA-containing buffer. Bound 125I-5A6 was defined as radioactivity released from the cell surface by trypsin and proteinase K. Nonspecific binding of125I-labeled IgG was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled antibody and subtracted. To measure the cellular degradation of125I-α2M* and 125I-uPA·PAI-1 complexes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts were incubated with125I-labeled ligand in the absence or presence of RAP or the fragments of RAP for 6 h at 37 °C. After incubation the degraded ligands were detected as radioactivity in the medium that is soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of degradation products generated in the absence of cells was also measured and subtracted from the total. As a first step in localizing the α2M* binding site in LRP, we investigated the abilities of various antibodies prepared against LRP to block the cellular-mediated uptake of α2M* (Fig.1A). As a positive control, rabbit polyclonal antibody R2629, which recognizes multiple epitopes on LRP, effectively inhibited α2M* uptake, whereas the non-immune IgG had no effect on α2M* internalization by these cells. Monoclonal antibody 8G1 was also able to inhibit LRP-mediated α2M* internalization in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, monoclonal antibody 5A6 did not inhibit α2M* internalization but rather seemed to enhance its uptake somewhat. Western blot analysis confirmed our previous report (7Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that monoclonal antibody 8G1 recognizes the 515-kDa α-chain of LRP to which all of the ligands have been found to bind, whereas 5A6 recognizes the 85-kDa β-chain (Fig. 1B). To determine if monoclonal antibody 8G1 blocks the direct interaction between α2M* and LRP, an in vitro binding assay was employed in which the binding of 125I-labeled α2M* to LRP immobilized on microtiter wells was measured. The results of this experiment (Fig. 2) demonstrated that monoclonal antibody 8G1 blocked the binding of α2M* to LRP. In contrast, the β-subunit-specific antibody 5A6 had no effect on the binding of α2M* to LRP in this solid phase assay. Curiously, when comparing the data from Fig.1 with those of Fig. 2, it appears that 5A6 seemed to stimulate LRP-mediated α2M* uptake in cells but had little effect on α2M* binding to LRP immobilized on plastic. Although the reason for this effect is not known, we speculate that 5A6 may dimerize LRP on the cell surface, which is likely to increase the affinity of this receptor for the multivalent ligand, α2M*. We next set out to map the region on LRP recognized by monoclonal antibody 8G1. For these experiments, a series of secreted receptor fragments was prepared (Fig.3A). Accumulating data demonstrate that a number of LRP ligands bind to the clusters of ligand binding cysteine-rich repeats, so we focused on LRP fragments which contain the four clusters of ligand binding repeats (sLRP1, sLRP2, sLRP3, sLRP4). We also designed a fragment that included cluster I along with EGF repeats and the YWTD region (sLRP1a) and a fragment with a portion of cluster II (sLRP1b) because a similar fragment of chicken LRP has been reported to display some α2M* binding activity (26Avramoglu R.K. Nimpf J. McLeod R.S. Ko K.W. Wang Y. FitzGerald D. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6057-6065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The constructs contained a myc epitope tag at their carboxyl-terminal region. After transfection of cells, the conditioned medium was collected, and secreted LRP fragments were detected by immunoblotting with anti-myc IgG (Fig.3B, left). When the same samples were probed with 8G1 antibody (Fig. 3B, right), sLRP1, sLRP1a, and sLRP1b were recognized by 8G1. In contrast, sLRP2, sLRP3 and sLRP4 were not recognized by 8G1. These results indicate that the 8G1 binding site is located within a stretch of amino acids encompassing residues 1–172 in the LRP sequence, which contains the first cluster of ligand binding repeats along with two EGF-like repeats. When sLRP-containing medium was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions prior to immunoblotting, monoclonal antibody 8G1 no longer recognized any of the LRP fragments (data not shown), indicating that the 8G1-binding epitope is not comprised of a linear stretch of amino acids. Experiments were also performed to determine if α2M* was capable of binding to full-length LRP or any secreted receptor fragment using a ligand blotting protocol. The ligand blot experiments failed to detect α2M* binding to full-length LRP or any secreted receptor fragment, indicating that α2M* binding to LRP is sensitive to the conformation of the LRP molecule. To identify the region on LRP responsible for binding α2M*, LRP mini-receptors were constructed in which various clusters of ligand binding repeats were fused with the entire β-chain containing amyc epitope at its carboxyl terminus (Fig.4). In addition, a mini-receptor (termed mLRP1b) was also prepared which contained the first cluster of repeats along with the first three repeats from cluster II. Plasmids containing the cDNA encoding these receptors were transfected into LRP-deficient CHO 13-5-1 cells, and the expression and processing of the receptors were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-mycIgG. This revealed that all mini-receptors were expressed at similar levels and processed by furin (Fig. 4B, left). Immunoblotting of the same cell lysates with 8G1 (Fig. 4B,right) indicated that constructs containing the first cluster of ligand binding repeats were recognized by 8G1, data that are consistent with the results obtained with the soluble receptors. Further, the 8G1 blot confirmed furin processing of mLRP1 and mLRP1b because α-chains of mature mini-receptors were readily detectable (Fig. 4B, right). Next, CHO 13-5-1 cells transfected with various mini-receptors were employed to measure the internalization of 125I-labeled 8G1 (Fig. 5A) and125I-labeled 5A6. Cells expressing mLRP1 and mLRP1b mediated the internalization of 125I-labeled 8G1 (Fig.5A), whereas cells expressing mLRP2 or LC were unable to internalize antibody 8G1. Studies using 125I-labeled β-chain monoclonal antibody 5A6 confirmed that both mLRP2 and LC are effectively delivered to the cell surface, and capable of mediating the endocytosis of this antibody (Fig. 5B), confirming that these mini-receptors are functional. We next measured the ability of various mini-receptors to mediate the internalization of125I-labeled α2M* and found that cells transfected with mLRP1b were much more efficient in internalizing α2M* than cells expressing mLRP1, mLRP2 or LRP light chain (LC) (Fig. 6A). To correct for different expression levels of mini-receptors, transfected cells were chilled to 4 °C, and the amount of125I-labeled 5A6 bound to the cells was measured (Fig.6B). Fig. 6C shows the internalization of α2M* adjusted to the difference in the expression levels of mini-receptors (i.e. normalized to the amount of 5A6 IgG bound at 4 °C). The result suggests that optimal binding of α2M* to LRP requires ligand binding repeats from cluster I as well as from cluster II. In separate experiments, we also examined cells transfected with mLRP3 and mLRP4 and found that these mini-receptors were unable to bind and internalize α2M* (data not shown).Figure 6Uptake of α2M* by CHO 13-5-1 cells transfected with mini-LRPs. CHO 13-5-1 cells transiently transfected with indicated mini-LRP constructs were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 15 nm125I-α2M* (A) or for 2 h on ice with 20 nm125I-5A6 IgG (B). After incubation the amount of internalized or bound ligand was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To compare the efficiency of α2M* internalization mediated by different mini-receptors, we divided the amount of internalized α2M* by the amount of 5A6 bound to the surface of the corresponding cell line (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RAP is composed of four domains (27Medved L.V. Migliorini M. Mikhailenko I. Barrientos L.G. Llinas M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and contains two LRP binding sites, one within the first two domains (D1D2) and one in the fourth domain (D4) (27Medved L.V. Migliorini M. Mikhailenko I. Barrientos L.G. Llinas M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of each of these domains to inhibit the uptake of 125I-labeled uPA·PAI-1 complexes and 125I-labeled α2M* (Fig.7). Both D1D2 and D4 inhibited the LRP-mediated internalization of 125I-labeled uPA·PAI-1 complexes (Fig. 7A), a ligand that binds to repeats within cluster II as well as cluster IV. 2I. Mikhailenko and D. K. Strickland, unpublished observations. In contrast to uPA·PAI-1, the internalization of α2M* was only blocked by the D1D2 fragment of RAP, whereas D4 had no inhibitory effect on LRP-mediated uptake of α2M* (Fig. 7B). To identify the portions of LRP which bind the RAP fragments D1D2 and D4, we transfected cells with various LRP mini-receptors and measured internalization of radiolabeled D1D2 and D4. In the same experiment uptake of 125I-5A6 was determined to adjust for difference in the levels of receptor expression. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 8.125I-Labeled D1D2 was effectively internalized by cells expressing mLRP1b and mLRP2 but not by cells expressing mLRP1 or LC (Fig. 8A), indicating that the D1D2 binding site is located within three amino-terminal ligand binding domains of the cluster II. Thus, D1D2, which binds to cluster II, can effectively compete for α2M* binding. In the same experiment, D4 was also found to bind to mLRP1b (Fig. 8B), but remarkably it failed to inhibit α2M* binding. To compare α2M* binding properties of full-length LRP and mLRP1b, we expressed these receptors in CHO 13-5-1 cells and measured125I-α2M* uptake in presence of excess D1D2 and D4 fragments of RAP and 8G1 IgG (Fig.9A). Consistent with results shown earlier (Figs. 1 and 7), monoclonal antibody 8G1 and D1D2 inhibited the interaction of α2M* with both full-length LRP and mini-receptor mLRP1b, but D4 did not. To compare the relative affinity of α2M* for LRP and mLRP1b, CHO 13-5-1 cells were transfected with full-length LRP and mLRP1b, and the transfected cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of125I-labeled α2M*. As expected, cells transfected with either LRP or mLRP1b showed a dose-dependent increase in α2M* uptake, which approached saturation at higher α2M* concentrations (Fig.9B). The concentration of α2M* required for half-saturation in the LRP-transfected cells was 17 nm, whereas the concentration required for the mLRP1b transfected cells was 34 nm. These results indicate similar affinity of the mLRP1b and LRP for α2M*. A major question that remains unanswered is how LRP can bind multiple structurally distinct ligands with such high affinity. An important component in answering this question lies in identifying regions on LRP which recognize specific ligands. Identification of the regions on LRP involved in recognizing α2M* has proven to be difficult because unlike most other LRP ligands, α2M* binding to LRP appears sensitive to LRP conformation. Previous work indicates that α2M* binds a unique region on LRP because its binding to this receptor is not competed with other ligands, such as apoE (28Mahmood Hussain M. Maxfield F.R. Más-Oliva J. Tabas I. Ji Z.-S. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13936-13940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tissue-type plasminogen activator (29Bu G. Williams S. Strickland D.K. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7427-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), or with a Fab fragment that binds to a region within cluster II (30Horn I.R. Moestrup S.K. van den Berg B.M. Pannekoek H. Nielsen M.S. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11770-11775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Earlier studies by Moestrup and Gliemann (31Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that a 75-kDa proteolytic fragment of LRP containing cluster II (residues 776–1399) recognized the 125I-labeled rat α1-macroglobulin light chain. Later studies, using surface plasmon resonance reported measurable binding of LRP fragments containing either cluster II or cluster IV to α2M* immobilized on sensor chips (4Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Together, these in vitrobinding studies suggest that the α2M* binding site in LRP may be contained within cluster II or cluster IV. However, in contrast to these experiments, cells transfected with LRP mini-receptors containing clusters II or clusters IV failed to bind α2M* or mediate its cellular internalization (21Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Li Y. Osaka H. Fitzgerald D.J. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This failure was not caused by incorrect folding or cellular processing of these mini-receptors, as they were fully functional in mediating the internalization of other ligands. The objective of the current investigation was to map the binding site on LRP for α2M*. Our strategy relied on the generation of fully functional LRP deletion mutants. Each mini-receptor was appropriately processed and delivered to the cell surface and functioned to endocytose a monoclonal antibody recognizing an epitope on the β-subunit. We used these mini-receptors to map the binding sites on LRP for two inhibitors that block the LRP-mediated uptake of125I-labeled α2M* in cells. The first inhibitor, monoclonal antibody 8G1, was found to bind to a fragment of LRP containing the first two ligand binding repeats, along with two EGF-type repeats. A second inhibitor, an amino-terminal fragment of RAP, was found to bind to repeats within cluster II. These data suggest that regions of both cluster I and cluster II form a high affinity α2M* binding site. This was confirmed by constructing a mini-receptor containing ligand binding repeats within cluster I as well as the first three ligand binding repeats of cluster II (residues 1–954 of the LRP α-chain) and demonstrating that this receptor is effective in internalizing α2M*. Thus, α2M* appears to be the first known ligand to recognize repeats within cluster I. Human α2M is a tetrameric protease inhibitor composed of four identical subunits. As a consequence of the structural transformation of α2M upon formation of a complex with proteinases, the carboxyl-terminal receptor binding domain of each subunit becomes exposed, generating four identical binding sites for LRP. In vitro binding of α2M* to LRP (23Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) fits a model in which high affinity (KD = 100–500 pm) binding occurs when two domains of α2M* recognize adjacent receptors, whereas lower affinity binding (KD = 1–10 nm) occurs when only one of the four domains binds to LRP (31Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together with the current results, these studies suggest two possible models for the binding of α2M* to LRP (Fig. 10). In the first model, repeats from cluster I and II combine to form an α2M* binding site (Fig. 10A), whereas in the second model (Fig. 10B), one subunit of α2M* recognizes repeats in cluster I, whereas another subunit recognizes repeats in cluster II. Both models accommodate the interaction of a single α2M* molecule with two LRP molecules. Currently, it is not possible to distinguish between these models, but the sensitivity of α2M* binding to the conformation of LRP suggests that the first model (Fig. 10A) more accurately reflects the binding mechanism. The models are supported by NMR measurements that reported a weak interaction (KDapproximately equal to 140 µm) between the first repeat of cluster II and the receptor binding domain of α2M* (33Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3264-3269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and by plasmon resonance measurements reporting that tandems of first and second or second and third repeats of cluster II bind α2M* weakly (KD = 20 µm) when α2M* was coupled to a sensor chip (34Andersen O.M. Christensen P.A. Christensen L.L. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10627-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The current investigation begins to give insight into the complexities of ligand recognition by LRP. Crystallographic and NMR studies of individual ligand binding repeats of LDL receptor and LRP revealed that the sequence variability in short loop regions of each repeat results in a unique contour surface and charge density for each repeat (33Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3264-3269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The current study, along with previous work, suggests that the ability of LRP to bind numerous structurally distinct ligands with high affinity results from the presence of 31 ligand binding repeats in the molecule, forming a unique contour surface and charge distribution, and from the multiple interactions between both the ligand and receptor. It is now apparent that certain ligands recognize different combinations of the ligand binding repeats in a sequential fashion, whereas others such as α2M* recognize repeats from separate clusters. Identification of regions on LRP that are important for recognizing α2M* will now allow development of specific inhibitors capable of preventing this binding. These inhibitors should be extremely useful for dissecting out the contributions of α2M* in normal and pathological processes. For example, α2M* associates with LRP in neurons and induces a calcium influx via N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (12Bacskai B.J. Xia M.Q. Strickland D.K. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11551-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The influx of calcium caused by LRP-mediated activation ofN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor channels is likely to impact a variety of downstream signaling cascades and may provide a mechanism of altering local synaptic plasticity. Assessing the contribution of α2M* to neuronal function in vivo using an LRP antagonist such as RAP has not been possible because RAP blocks the binding of all ligands to LRP and thus is not selective for a particular ligand. Other LRP ligands, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator, are also implicated in neuronal function. Tissue-type PA associates with LRP, and this interaction is important for hippocampal late phase long term potentiation. Thus, defining the physiological role of α2M* and tissue-type PA in neuronal function will require inhibitors capable of specifically blocking their interaction with LRP. α2M* is also thought to promote the catabolism of the Aβ peptide by binding this molecule and facilitating its LRP-mediated uptake. LRP is suspected to play a dual role in Alzheimer's disease (35Ulery P.G. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by promoting both the synthesis (13Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J.

The development of inhibitors that specifically block α2M* binding to LRP but do not impair the interaction of LRP with other ligands such as amyloid precursor protein will be useful for distinguishing between the opposing roles of LRP in Alzheimer's disease and will more precisely define the physiological role of this receptor in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2009618190,"Ribosomal protein S4 represses synthesis of the four ribosomal proteins (including itself) in theEscherichia coli α operon by binding to a nested pseudoknot structure that spans the ribosome binding site. A model for the repression mechanism previously proposed two unusual features: (i) the mRNA switches between conformations that are “active” or “inactive” in translation, with S4 as an allosteric effector of the inactive form, and (ii) S4 holds the 30 S subunit in an unproductive complex on the mRNA (“entrapment”), in contrast to direct competition between repressor and ribosome binding (“displacement”). These two key points have been experimentally tested. First, it is found that the mRNA pseudoknot exists in an equilibrium between two conformers with different electrophoretic mobilities. S4 selectively binds to one form of the RNA, as predicted for an allosteric effector; binding of ribosomal 30 S subunits is nearly equal in the two forms. Second, we have used S4 labeled at a unique cysteine with either of two fluorophores to characterize its interactions with mRNA and 30 S subunits. Equilibrium experiments detect the formation of a specific ternary complex of S4, mRNA pseudoknot, and 30 S subunits. The existence of this ternary complex is unambiguous evidence for translational repression of the α operon by an entrapment mechanism. Ribosomal protein S4 represses synthesis of the four ribosomal proteins (including itself) in theEscherichia coli α operon by binding to a nested pseudoknot structure that spans the ribosome binding site. A model for the repression mechanism previously proposed two unusual features: (i) the mRNA switches between conformations that are “active” or “inactive” in translation, with S4 as an allosteric effector of the inactive form, and (ii) S4 holds the 30 S subunit in an unproductive complex on the mRNA (“entrapment”), in contrast to direct competition between repressor and ribosome binding (“displacement”). These two key points have been experimentally tested. First, it is found that the mRNA pseudoknot exists in an equilibrium between two conformers with different electrophoretic mobilities. S4 selectively binds to one form of the RNA, as predicted for an allosteric effector; binding of ribosomal 30 S subunits is nearly equal in the two forms. Second, we have used S4 labeled at a unique cysteine with either of two fluorophores to characterize its interactions with mRNA and 30 S subunits. Equilibrium experiments detect the formation of a specific ternary complex of S4, mRNA pseudoknot, and 30 S subunits. The existence of this ternary complex is unambiguous evidence for translational repression of the α operon by an entrapment mechanism. 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid Synthesis of nearly all ribosomal proteins in Escherichia coli is regulated by an autogenous feedback mechanism: translation of each ribosomal protein operon is repressed by one of its encoded r-proteins, which invariably also has a strong affinity for rRNA (1Nomura M. Gourse R. Baughman G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 75-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In the case of the α operon, the translational repressor, S4, recognizes a nested pseudoknot structure (Fig.1A) surrounding the ribosome binding site of the first gene of the operon (S13) (2Thomas M. Bedwell D.M. Nomura M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Deckman I.C. Draper D.E. Thomas M.S. J. Mol.

An unusual repression mechanism has been proposed for this operon (5Spedding G.S. Draper D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4399-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Draper D.E. Gluick T.C. Schlax P.J. Simons R.W. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 415-436Google Scholar) based on (i) a conformational switch between two folded states of the mRNA pseudoknot structure, and (ii) an inactive “entrapment” complex formed among S4, mRNA, and initiating ribosomes (Fig.1B). The present work presents evidence in support of these two key aspects of the proposed mechanism and shows that the RNA is an active participant in repression. Translation initiation in bacteria has two essential steps (for a review, see Ref. 7Draper D.E. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 902-908Google Scholar). First, tRNA fMet, mRNA, and the 30 S subunit form a preinitiation complex stabilized by base pair formation between the mRNA Shine-Dalgarno sequence and its complement on the 3′-end of the 16 S rRNA (8Calogero R.A. Pon C.L. Canonaco M.A. Gualerzi C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6427-6431Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This complex is in rapid equilibrium with its components. The second step is a slow, essentially irreversible conformational change that allows the initiation codon to base pair to the tRNA fMet anticodon and form a stable initiation complex. Translation rates are frequently regulated at the first step, where proteins that stabilize RNA structure encompassing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence may prevent binding of initiating ribosomes and reduce translational efficiency. This kind of competition between a repressor protein and initiating ribosomes has been termed a “displacement” repression mechanism (9Draper D.E. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression. Plenum Press, New York1987: 1-26Crossref Google Scholar). An entirely different regulation mechanism has been proposed for regulation of α operon ribosomal proteins (Fig. 1B). Kinetic studies of initiation complex formation suggested that the mRNA adopted two conformations, both capable of binding 30 S subunits, but only the “active” conformation supported formation of the ternary initiation complex (10Spedding G.S. Gluick T.C. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In further studies of S4 binding kinetics, it appeared that the repressor bound only the “inactive” conformation and trapped 30 S subunits in a dead-end complex unable to bind tRNA fMet (5Spedding G.S. Draper D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4399-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This repression strategy has two novel aspects. First, S4 functions as an allosteric effector in that it is proposed to shift an equilibrium between two RNA conformational states. Second, S4 acts at the second, irreversible initiation step to stabilize an inactive 30 S subunit·mRNA complex, a mechanism termedentrapment (9Draper D.E. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression. Plenum Press, New York1987: 1-26Crossref Google Scholar). Experiments strongly supporting both of these unusual repression strategies, an mRNA-based allosteric switch and formation of an S4·mRNA·ribosome entrapment complex, are presented in this work. We first show that two electrophoretically distinguishable mRNA conformers have properties expected for the postulated active and inactive mRNA states. We then use S4 modified with a fluorescent tag to observe formation of the postulated entrapment complex. Plasmids for transcription of an RNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 16–127 of the transcript from the α operon promoter, called 127 RNA, and for transcription of L11-Cys76 mRNA have been described (11Gluick T.C. Gerstner R.G. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Xing Y. Draper D.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). APvuII-HindIII DNA restriction fragment containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence followed by α operon sequence −16 to +139 was prepared from a previously described pT7-1 derivative (4Tang C.K. Draper D.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 531-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and inserted into pUC19 cut with HindIII andSmaI. This created an in-frame fusion of the first 139 nucleotides of α mRNA with the pUC19 lacZ fragment which could be transcribed from a T7 promoter. An SphI site was used to linearize the plasmid to transcribe RNA for 30 S subunit binding studies (α RNA), and an SspI site was used to transcribe RNA for in vitro translation. Site-directed mutagenesis Cys67 → Ala then created a uniqueBsrGI site within the α mRNA pseudoknot sequence in this plasmid. Synthetic DNA fragments inserted between theBsrGI site and the downstream SphI site created a derivative with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (A84-G88) changed to its Watson-Crick complement. A DNA fragment inserted betweenBsrGI and an upstream KpnI site created a deletion in which transcription starts with a 12-nucleotide sequence (GGGCCCAATCTT) followed by G68. Transcripts from these plasmids were termed ASD RNA and Δ68 RNA, respectively. Ribosomes were purified approximately as described (10Spedding G.S. Gluick T.C. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) from MRE600 cells grown to an absorbance of 1A600 in Luria broth. Frozen cells were thawed on ice, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C), 100 mm NH4Cl, 10.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; 2 ml/g cells), and lysed by passage through a prechilled French press (Amicon; 12,000 p.s.i.) one or two times. Lysed cells were centrifuged immediately at 30,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was retained. The fraction precipitating between 35 and 70% ammonium sulfate (first addition, 19.6 g of ammonium sulfate/100 ml of supernatant; second addition, 22 g/100 ml) was redissolved in 3.3 ml of buffer A for each 1 g of cells. The resuspended ribosomes were centrifuged at 52,000 rpm (Beckman Ti55.2 rotor) for 140 min, and the pellet material was resuspended overnight at 0 °C in buffer A. Ribosomes were salt washed once by centrifugation through an equal volume of buffer A plus 15% (w/v) sucrose and 500 mm NH4Cl; resuspended ribosomes (buffer A or buffer A with 1.1 mmMg(OAc)2) were stored frozen at −70 °C. 30 S subunits were prepared by sucrose gradient sedimentation of ribosomes in buffer A with 1.1 mm Mg(OAc)2, as described (10Spedding G.S. Gluick T.C. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Linear plasmid DNA was transcribed using procedures outlined by Gurevich (13Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or described previously (14Draper D.E. White S.A. Kean J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RNA used in nitrocellulose filter binding assays was purified using Nensorb reverse phase columns (14Draper D.E. White S.A. Kean J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RNA used in gel mobility experiments was excised from denaturing polyacrylamide gels and extracted by either electroelution (Schleicher & Schuell Elutrap) or soaking crushed gel in buffer. α mRNA fragments and their derivatives were renatured for 8 min at 65 °C in buffer containing 350 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS1 (pH 7.0) followed by 22 min at 42 °C in the same buffer with or without 40 mm MgCl2 (11Gluick T.C. Gerstner R.G. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). RNA encoding L11-C76 was renatured in buffer A at room temperature, as the RNA precipitated when renaturation conditions for α mRNA were used. After renaturation, RNA was placed on ice, and buffer and salt concentrations were adjusted as needed for binding or translation assays. E. coli ribosomal protein S4 was purified from a T7 overexpression system by a described protocol with slight modifications (15Baker A.M. Draper D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22939-22945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 1 liter of LB containing 100 µg/ml carbenicillin, induced at anA600 of ∼0.6 with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration), and harvested after another 3 h of growth. Cells were lysed twice using a French press, and the final sodium chloride concentration was adjusted to 0.7 m. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm, and the supernatant was dialyzed against 2 liters of 20 mm potassium phosphate, 6 m urea, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 5.6). Protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine were added at this stage to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The dialyzed material was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to remove aggregated material and then filtered through a 0.22-µm filter (Millipore). This material was loaded on a Bio-Gel TSK-SP-5-PW column (Bio-Rad). S4 eluted at about 450 mm potassium chloride and was estimated to be >95% pure by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Pyrene and IAEDANS were used for labeling the single cysteine of S4 using maleimide chemistry (Molecular Probes). These dyes were chosen as the two fluorophores for studying translational repression in the S4 system because of their relatively long excited lifetimes. Labeling was done in the presence of 6 m urea at pH 7.5 to avoid labeling residues other than the cysteine. The appropriate dye in dimethyl formamide was added slowly to the S4 solution with gentle stirring. The dye to protein ratio was 10:1, and the final concentration of dimethyl formamide was kept lower than 1% by volume. For labeling with pyrene the reactants were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, whereas with IAEDANS the incubation was for 90 min at 37 °C. Both reactions were quenched by adding dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 1 mm and letting the reaction proceed at room temperature for 30 min. The labeled material was dialyzed extensively, any precipitated material was discarded, and the labeled protein was purified as described above at pH 7.5. Both pyrene- and IAEDANS-labeled S4 eluted as two distinct peaks in the range of 450–500 mm potassium chloride; both contained labeled protein. For both pyrene-S4 and IAEDANS-S4, fractions with the highest extent of protein labeling were used. The purified protein was refolded by dialysis against 10 mm MOPS, 350 mm KCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol (pH 7.2) at 4 °C and stored at −70 °C. On an 8m urea (pH 4.5) polyacrylamide gel, nonlabeled S4 and the two fractions of pyrene- and IAEDANS-labeled S4 ran similarly, indicating that they had the same net charge. The concentration of labeled protein was determined using an absorbance at 280 nm and calculated extinction coefficient (15Baker A.M. Draper D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22939-22945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) after correcting for absorbance of the label. Using dual wavelength analysis, pyrene-S4 and IAEDANS-S4 were ∼27 and 60% labeled, respectively. S4 was renatured before an experiment by warming at 37 °C for 30 min, slowly cooling, and then placing it on ice. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays performed using35S-labeled 127 RNA at ∼8 °C showed that S4, pyrene-S4, and IAEDANS-S4 were about 65, 64, and 33% active, respectively. These fractional activities agreed with experiments using methylene blue-stained gels and were used in calculations of association constants and stoichiometry of interaction(s). Unlabeled S4 and pyrene- and IAEDANS-labeled S4 were subjected to MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight) mass spectrometry. The respective calculated and observed molecular weights were S4, 23,339 and 23,350; pyrene-S4, 23,635 and 23,645; IAEDANS-S4, 23,646 and 23,660. The results suggest that both label-S4 derivatives are singly labeled. No evidence of a doubly labeled specie was seen in either case. Nitrocellulose filters from Schleicher & Schuell were wetted and stored in buffer A prior to binding experiments. Filters were maintained at room temperature during the assays. Varying concentrations of 30 S subunits (0–5 µm) were incubated with a fixed amount of renatured RNA in buffer A at 0 °C for equilibrium constant determinations; incubation times from 20 to 90 min did not affect the final results. Stoichiometric assays were performed using 0.1–0.2 µmunlabeled RNA; titrations for determination of equilibrium constants used trace amounts of RNA. For equilibrium competition assays, fixed concentrations of subunits (50–300 nm) and radiolabeled α mRNA were incubated with varying concentrations (0–10 µm) of unlabeled competitor RNA for 40 min at 0 °C. In all assays, 25–35 µl of each titration point was filtered on a prewashed filter, and the filter was washed immediately with 200 µl of ice-cold buffer A. Filters were dried before quantitation by scintillation counting. Filter titration data were fit to single site binding isotherms as described by Draper et al. (16Draper D.E. Deckman I.C. Vartikar J.V. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 203-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); errors in the reported binding constants are typically ± 25%. In experiments that competed labeled and unlabeled RNAs for 30 S subunit binding, the concentration of 30 S subunits bound to labeled RNA was considered negligible, and the total subunit concentration therefore is given by [30S]0=[30S]+Kc[30S]1+Kc[30S][C]0(Eq. 1) where [30 S]0 and [C]0 are the total concentrations of subunits and competitor RNA, respectively, andKc is the affinity of the competitor RNA for subunits. This equation was solved for [30 S], which was then used to predict the extent of subunit binding to labeled RNA. Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) was used for least squares fitting of both standard and competition binding curves. The fast and slow conformers of 127 RNA were resolved by electrophoresis as described (11Gluick T.C. Gerstner R.G. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), using 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 30 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mmMgCl2; the electrophoresis apparatus was thermostatted at 8 °C with buffer recirculation. For band shift experiments, S4 protein was first renatured at 37 °C for 30 min in 30 mmMOPS (pH 7.0), 350 mm KCl, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol; RNA was renatured as described above (RNA transcription), only using 10 mm MgCl2 in the buffer. After mixing protein and RNA (50 pmol) in 10 µl at 0 °C the final buffer was adjusted to 30 mm MOPS, 350 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and electrophoresis was carried out. Binding of 32P-labeled 5′-DNA to 127 RNA was studied in a similar way except that 20 mm MgCl2 was present during RNA renaturation. DNA oligomer was added to the RNA at 0 °C, incubated for 10 min, run on a gel, and the bands quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Commercial S30 extracts (Promega) were used to translate purified, renatured RNAs. Reactions were run according to the manufacturer's instructions (using [35S]methionine to label the translated proteins) with the exception that 0.25–0.5 mg/ml rifampicin was added to reduce background expression in the system (17Kohrer C. Mayer C. Grobner P. Piendl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Reactions were a 30-µl total volume with 4 pmol of added RNA and were incubated for 20–60 min. Aliquots were treated immediately with ice-cold acetone to precipitate protein and were centrifuged. The pelleted protein was resuspended in SDS-gel loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Equal counts of radioactivity were loaded on each lane of standard SDS gels (19% acrylamide). Gels were dried, and the amounts of radioactivity in individual protein bands were quantitated using a PhosphorImager. An SLM 48000 fluorometer was used in L-format for emission spectroscopy and in T-format with appropriate cut-on filters and polarizers for steady-state polarization measurements. Both dyes were excited at 345 nm with a 2 nm bandpass; 380 nm and 450 nm cut-on filters were used on the emission side for pyrene and IAEDANS, respectively. A manual shutter after the excitation monochromator was used to allow exposure of the samples to light only during the course of a measurement. Loss of fluorescence with time was reduced further by treating the cuvette (Starna Cells) with Gel Slick (J. T. Baker), coating it with 0.3 mg/ml hen egg lysozyme (Sigma), and then rinsing it thoroughly. This procedure decreases the fluorescence loss to below 7% over the typical time span of an experiment. Based on changes in protein tryptophan fluorescence over the duration of an experiment, most of the decrease in fluorescence could be attributed to photobleaching of the fluorophore rather than adsorption of protein to the cuvette. Control experiments showed that the anisotropy was stable to within ± 0.002. All experiments were done in 10 mm MOPS, 350 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2) at 15 ± 0.5 °C to “freeze” the conformations of 127 RNA during the course of the experiment. The contents of the cuvette were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min after each addition of titrant, and appropriate correction was made for dilution in the data analysis. The solution was mixed using a microsubmersible magnetic stirrer, and its temperature was maintained using a circulating water bath. A fragment of the α operon mRNA leader sequence containing the pseudoknot regulatory structure migrates in gels as two distinct bands under nondenaturing conditions. We have shown previously that these electrophoretically “fast” and “slow” species represent alternative RNA conformations (11Gluick T.C. Gerstner R.G. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). At temperatures above ∼30 °C, the two conformers interconvert readily, and the position of the equilibrium is sensitive to Mg2+ concentration and pH; at low temperatures, the interconversion is extremely slow, and the conformers are kinetically trapped. RNA samples can be prepared in predominantly fast or slow forms by renaturation in buffer with or without 40 mmMg2+ at 42 °C, respectively, followed by rapid chilling. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to determine whether the two conformers differ in their affinity for S4 repressor. S4 protein was incubated with renatured 127 RNA (nucleotides 16–127 of the α mRNA transcript; see Fig. 1A and “Materials and Methods”) at 0 °C, where interconversion of the two RNA conformations is extremely slow, and reactions were run on a nondenaturing gel at cold temperatures. The fast form is titrated stoichiometrically (1:1) by the protein, and the complex appears as a slower moving band (Fig. 2A). This shifted band stains with both Coomassie Blue and methylene blue, indicating that it contains both RNA and protein. The slow form is unaffected by high S4 concentrations (up to 10 µm). When protein is incubated with RNA at a temperature that allows rapid equilibration of the two RNA conformers (42 °C), S4 is able to shift all of the RNA into a binary complex (Fig. 2B). We conclude that S4 specifically recognizes only one of the two RNA conformations and is therefore able to drive the equilibrium between the conformations entirely to the fast form. In the proposed repression model, 30 S subunits bind both mRNA conformations. To see whether ribosomes may bind the slow and fast mRNA forms differently, we first used a gel assay to determine if the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is accessible in each form. As seen in Fig. 3, a 32P-labeled DNA 14-mer that complements the mRNA from the Shine-Dalgarno sequence through the initiation codon (see Fig. 1A) appears to bind equally well to both mRNA forms. The calculated affinities are 27 µm−1 for fast form RNA and 33 µm−1 for slow form RNA. Essentially the same result was obtained with an 11-mer that did not include nucleotides complementary to the initiation codon. Gels with this oligomer showed broader bands, and it was more difficult to resolve the two binding constants, but the average binding was 28 µm−1, and there was no suggestion that the two RNA conformers bound the oligomer differently. That the two oligomers bound the expected position on the mRNA was confirmed by digestion of the DNA-RNA hybrids with RNase H; only two RNA fragments (of the expected sizes) were observed on denaturing gels. We conclude that the Shine-Dalgarno region has nearly the same accessibility for hybridization in the two mRNA conformers. We measured the affinity of the two mRNA conformers for 30 S subunits directly using nitrocellulose filter binding assays at low temperatures where the renatured RNA is trapped predominantly in the fast or slow form. In some titrations, 0.1–0.2 µm unlabeled mRNA was added to each titration point, which increased the amount of 30 S subunits needed to reach a given level of saturation compared with titrations using only trace concentrations of unlabeled RNA. From the resulting shifts in the binding curves, we estimated that the 30 S subunit preparations used in these studies were >90% active in mRNA binding. Fast and slow form mRNAs bind 30 S subunits with nearly the same affinity at 0 °C (Fig.4A and TableI). Binding constants were slightly stronger when measured at 22 °C but still not significantly different between forms (slow form, 26 µm−1; fast form, 36 µm−1).Table I30 S subunit binding and translational efficiency of mRNAsRNAKobsRelativeKobsTranslational efficiencyµm−1α RNA (slow)12.6 (± 3.0)1.001.00α RNA (fast)15.5 (± 4.8)1.20.85, 1.07Δ68 RNA23.8 (± 6.0)1.90.55, 0.71ASD RNA3.0 (± 2.3)<0.24NDL11-C76 RNA34 (± 17)2.733Binding affinities were determined at 0 °C as described under “Materials and Methods”; note that α RNA and its derivatives used for binding studies terminated at position 139 of the α mRNA, whereas in vitro translation used longer transcripts.

To find out whether 30 S subunit binding to the mRNA fragments depends on the presence of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, an “anti-Shine-Dalgarno” RNA was prepared in which the AGGAG sequence was changed to its Watson-Crick complement (ASD RNA). Binding of this RNA to 30 S subunits could not be detected in a filter binding assay; either the complex forms only weakly, or the complex is not efficiently retained on the filter. To distinguish these possibilities, we competed unlabeled ASD RNA and labeled wild type RNA for 30 S subunit binding in the filter assay. The ASD RNA is much less efficient than unlabeled wild type RNA at reducing the extent of labeled α RNA binding (Fig.4B). From these data, we estimate that ASD RNA binds 7-fold more weakly than α RNA, although the data systematically deviate from the calculated curve. Relevant to this discrepancy, calculations of the relative affinity assumed only one binding site for 30 S subunits on ASD RNA; because the binding is so weak, we could not measure the stoichiometry directly. If there is more than one potential subunit binding site on the mRNA (a likely possibility for weak, nonspecific binding), then the calculation will have correspondingly overestimated the binding strength. Calogero et al. (8Calogero R.A. Pon C.L. Canonaco M.A. Gualerzi C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6427-6431Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) also found about an order of magnitude difference in 30 S subunit binding affinity between RNAs with and without a Shine-Dalgarno sequence. It is also noteworthy that ASD RNA is resolved into two bands on nondenaturing gels, but both migrate slightly faster than the wild type sequence. Binding of S4 to ASD RNA could not be detected in filter binding assays by either titration of labeled ASD RNA with S4 or competition of unlabeled ASD RNA for labeled α RNA (K< 105m−1). Thus mutation of the Shine-Dalgarno region has a major effect on the folding of the pseudoknot structure. 30 S subunit affinities for two other mRNA ribosome binding sites were also measured for comparison with the wild type α mRNA (Table I); both measurements suggest that the α mRNA pseudoknot only weakly restricts ribosome access to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. One RNA is the α mRNA leader from which an upstream sequence forming the pseudoknot has been deleted (Δ68 RNA; Fig.1A). Δ68 RNA binds less than 2-fold better than the wild type RNA (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2029835409,"The Hemophilus influenzae Hap adhesin is an autotransporter protein that undergoes an autoproteolytic cleavage event resulting in extracellular release of the adhesin domain (Haps) from the membrane-associated translocator domain (Hapβ). Hap autoproteolysis is mediated by Ser243 and occurs at LN1036-7 and to a lesser extent at more COOH-terminal alternate sites. In the present study, we sought to further define the mechanism of Hap autoproteolysis. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues His98 and Asp140identified a catalytic triad conserved among a subfamily of autotransporters and reminiscent of the SA (chymotrypsin) clan of serine proteases. Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of histidine-tagged Hapβ species and site-directed mutagenesis established that autoproteolysis occurs at LT1046-7, FA1077-8, and FS1067-8, revealing a consensus target sequence for cleavage that consists of ((Q/R)(A/S)X(L/F)) at the P4 through P1 positions. Examination of a recombinant strain co-expressing a Hap derivative lacking all cleavage sites (HapΔ1036-99) and a Hap derivative lacking proteolytic activity (HapS243A) demonstrated that autoproteolysis occurs by an intermolecular mechanism. Kinetic analysis of Hap autoproteolysis in bacteria expressing Hap under control of an inducible promoter demonstrated that autoproteolysis increases as the density of Hap precursor in the outer membrane increases, confirming intermolecular cleavage and suggesting a novel mechanism for regulation of bacterial adherence and microcolony formation. The Hemophilus influenzae Hap adhesin is an autotransporter protein that undergoes an autoproteolytic cleavage event resulting in extracellular release of the adhesin domain (Haps) from the membrane-associated translocator domain (Hapβ). Hap autoproteolysis is mediated by Ser243 and occurs at LN1036-7 and to a lesser extent at more COOH-terminal alternate sites. In the present study, we sought to further define the mechanism of Hap autoproteolysis. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues His98 and Asp140identified a catalytic triad conserved among a subfamily of autotransporters and reminiscent of the SA (chymotrypsin) clan of serine proteases.

In pathogenic organisms, these pathways are essential for specific interactions that result in colonization of the host and progression to disease. The bacterial proteins that participate in these interactions are considered virulence factors and influence adherence to host cells, damage to host tissues, and interference with host defense mechanisms. In Gram-negative bacteria, surface and extracellular proteins must be transported across the inner membrane, the periplasm, and the outer membrane. This goal is achieved by one of five distinct secretion systems. The type V secretion system is used exclusively by the autotransporter family of proteins, typified by the IgA1 proteases ofNeisseria and Hemophilus species, the first such proteins to be identified (1Henderson I.R. Cappello R. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 529-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Autotransporters are typically expressed as precursor polypeptides with at least three functional domains, including an NH2-terminal signal sequence, an internal passenger domain, and a COOH-terminal translocator domain. The signal sequence directs export of the polypeptide across the bacterial inner membrane and is then removed by signal peptidase. Subsequently, the translocator domain inserts into the outer membrane and appears to fold into a β-barrel structure with a central hydrophilic pore, allowing extrusion of the passenger domain across the membrane. Once the passenger domain is localized on the cell surface, one of several fates is possible. In some cases, the passenger domain remains covalently linked to the membrane-associated β-barrel domain. In other cases, it is cleaved but remains cell associated. In still others, it is cleaved and then released extracellularly. Cleavage may involve an autoproteolytic event directed by protease activity in the passenger domain itself or may occur through the action of a separate bacterial protease. Autotransporter passenger domains have been ascribed a wide variety of functions, examples of which include adhesins, toxins, degradative enzymes, and serum resistance factors (2Henderson I.R. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Hemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative bacterium and represents a common cause of human disease, including both localized respiratory tract and systemic (invasive) disease (3Turk D.C. J. Med. Microbiol. 1984; 18: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The pathogenesis of H. influenzae disease begins with colonization of the upper respiratory tract. To facilitate colonization, H. influenzae elaborates both pilus and non-pilus proteins called adhesins, which promote adherence to host epithelial cells by interacting with specific host cell surface molecules. The H. influenzae Hap protein is a non-pilus adhesin that promotes adherence and invasion in assays with cultured human epithelial cells and also mediates bacterial aggregation and microcolony formation (4St. Geme III, J.W. de la Morena M.L. Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,5Hendrixson D.R. St Geme III, J.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In recent work, we demonstrated that Hap is an autotransporter protein and consists of a 110-kDa passenger domain called Haps and a 45-kDa translocator domain called Hapβ. The passenger domain has serine protease activity and directs autoproteolytic cleavage via Ser243, releasing Haps into the culture supernatant and leaving Hapβ embedded in the outer membrane (6Hendrixson D. de la Morena M.L. Stathopoulos C. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Of note, Ser243 is part of a GDSGS motif that is present in a subfamily of autotransporter proteins, including theNeisseria and Hemophilus IgA1 proteases and a diverse group of serine protease autotransporters secreted by members of the Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs) (7Brunder W.

Immun. 2000; 68: 2457-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hap autoproteolytic cleavage occurs primarily at the peptide bond between Leu1036 and Asn1037, and mutation of these two residues results in nearly complete inhibition of cleavage at this site and increased cleavage at three more COOH-terminal alternate sites (6Hendrixson D. de la Morena M.L. Stathopoulos C. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Autoproteolysis is blocked by several serine protease-specific inhibitors, including phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Pefabloc, and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, a component of human respiratory tract secretions. In addition to harboring serine protease activity, the Hapspassenger domain possesses the adhesive activities responsible for bacterial interaction with epithelial cells and bacterial aggregation. Thus, at first glance release of this domain from the bacterial cell surface seems counterproductive to promoting successful colonization. Indeed, mutation of the Hap active site serine to an alanine results in complete inhibition of autoproteolytic processing, full retention of Haps on the cell surface, and increased adherence and aggregation (6Hendrixson D. de la Morena M.L. Stathopoulos C. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the other hand, release of Haps may benefit H. influenzae in ways unrelated to its adhesive activities. For example, activity against host substrates has been demonstrated for IgA1 protease as well as several of the SPATE family members (2Henderson I.R. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Brunder W. Schmidt H. Karch H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 14Kilian M.

Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although no such host substrate has been identified yet for Hap, it is possible that Hap proteolytic activity against epithelial tissue components or immune system effectors may facilitate initial colonization. Alternatively, autoproteolytic cleavage of Hap at several sites on the same molecule may release bioactive peptides, as has been documented for IgA1 protease (16Pohlner J. Langenberg U. Wolk U. Beck S.C. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Finally, shedding of an adhesive domain from the cell surface may facilitate disbursement of individual organisms from microcolonies and allow spread to new sites. Such events may be controlled by the presence of host factors that modulate Hap autoproteolytic activity (e.g. secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor) or by features inherent to the mechanism of autoproteolysis itself. In the present study, we sought to characterize Hap autoproteolysis more fully, including the mechanism of catalysis, the identities of all cleavage sites, and the molecular nature of the enzyme-substrate interaction. Our results demonstrate that Hap belongs to the SA (chymotrypsin) clan and contains a catalytic triad conserved among a subfamily of autotransporter serine proteases. Identification of the three alternate autoproteolytic cleavage sites in Hap revealed a consensus target sequence for Hap enzymatic activity. Interestingly, kinetic analysis and examination of a recombinant strain expressing two different derivatives of Hap established that autoproteolysis occurs at least in part via an intermolecular mechanism. These results provide insights into an expanding family of bacterial serine proteases and suggest a novel mechanism for regulation of bacterial adherence. Amino acid alignments of protein sequences were performed using ClustalW v1.8 software available on the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center website (dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu).

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced intoE. coli strain DH5α by chemical transformation (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).H. influenzae strain DB117 was transformed using the MIV method of Herriott et al. (23Herriott R.M. Meyer E.M. Vogt M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 517-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using recombinant PCR1 techniques. To construct pHapH98A, pHapH117A, pHapD139A, and pHapD140A, pMLD100 (pUC19 containing a 6.7-kb insert with the hap gene fromH. influenzae strain N187) was used as a template to amplify a 1.4-kb 5′ PCR fragment and a 0.9-kb 3′ PCR fragment that overlapped at an 18-base region encompassing the appropriate mutated site. Each 5′ fragment was then combined with the corresponding 3′ fragment in a 1:1 molar ratio to serve as template in generating a 2.3-kb mutated recombinant PCR fragment using external primers from the initial PCR reactions plus a 1:100 dilution of an internal primer corresponding to the coding sequence of the mutated site. These recombinant PCR fragments were digested with AvaI and ClaI and then ligated into AvaI-ClaI-digested pMLD100. For construction of the primary autoproteolytic cleavage site mutant pHapL1036S, initial PCR products (1.1 kb 5′ fragment and 1.2 kb 3′ fragment) were amplified from pMLD100 and used as templates to generate a 2.3-kb mutated recombinant PCR fragment as described above. This recombinant PCR fragment was then digested with NheI andHindIII and ligated intoNheI-HindIII-digested pMLD100. The double autoproteolytic cleavage site mutants pHapL1036S::L1046S, pHapL1036S::F1067S, and pHapL1036S::F1077S were constructed in the same manner using pMLD100::HapL1036S as the template in the initial PCR reactions. To construct plasmid pHapLN1036-7SG::G3H6, a 1.8-kb PCR fragment corresponding to the COOH-terminal 600 residues of Hap was amplified from pDH101 (like pMLD100, but with the hap gene insert in the opposite orientation), incorporating codons for 3 glycine residues, 6 histidine residues, and a BamHI site at the 3′ end of the hap gene (5′ end of the PCR product). This PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and NheI and ligated into BamHI-NheI-digested pDH101. The resulting plasmid, pDH101::G3H6, was digested withDsaI and NsiI, liberating a 6.3-kb fragment that was then replaced by ligation with a 6.3-kb insert excised fromDsaI-NsiI-digested pDH101::LN1036-7SG (6Hendrixson D. de la Morena M.L. Stathopoulos C. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Construction of pHapΔ1036-99 was carried out by first amplifying initial PCR fragments corresponding to residues 650–1035 (1.1-kb 5′ fragment) and 1100–1395 (1.1-kb 3′ fragment) of Hap. The primers used to create these PCR products were engineered such that the two fragments overlapped at an 18-base region, allowing amplification of a recombinant PCR product in which the codons for residues 1035 and 1100 were immediately juxtaposed, deleting the intervening sequence. This recombinant PCR fragment was digested with NheI andHindIII and ligated intoNheI-HindIII-digested pMLD100. Plasmid pJS106::Trc was constructed by first amplifying a 1.6-kb PCR fragment that contained the lacIqgene, trc promoter, and polylinker cloning region from pTrc99A. The primers used in this amplification were engineered such that the resulting PCR product contained HindIII andPstI sites at the 5′ end and a HindIII site at the 3′ end, allowing digestion of this fragment with HindIII and ligation into HindIII-digested pDH101. The resulting plasmid, pDH101::Trc, was then digested with NcoI and BglII, excising a fragment containing the pTrc99A polylinker cloning region, the hap upstream region, and 1.4 kb of the hap coding sequence. Next, a 1.4-kb PCR fragment corresponding to the excised hap coding sequence was amplified from pDH101, incorporating an NcoI site at the 5′ end. This fragment was digested with NcoI andBglII and ligated intoNcoI-BglII-digested pDH101::Trc, thereby juxtaposing the hap start codon downstream of thetrc promoter and ribosome-binding site. Following the introduction of mutated fragments into the complete hap gene, mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Subsequently, the mutated hap genes were excised as 6.7-kb PstI fragments and then ligated intoPstI-digested pGJB103. Exceptions included the mutatedhap gene encoding HapΔ1036-99, which was ligated intoPstI-digested pLS88, and the mutated hap gene encoding HapLN1036-7SG::G3H6, which was excised as aBamHI-PstI fragment and ligated intoBglII-PstI-digested pGJB103. All constructs were first transformed into E. coli DH5α and then into H. influenzae strain DB117. DB117 expressing wild type Hap or mutant derivatives was grown to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.8. Sarkosyl-insoluble outer membrane proteins were isolated by the method of Carlone et al. (24Carlone G.M. Thomas M.L. Rumschlag H.S. Sottnek F.O. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 330-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and extracellular proteins were precipitated from culture supernatants with 10% trichloroacetic acid as described previously (4St. Geme III, J.W. de la Morena M.L. Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Outer membrane fractions were resuspended in 25 µl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, plus 25 µl of 2 × Laemmli buffer, while precipitated extracellular proteins were resuspended in 10 µl of 1 m Tris, pH 9.0, plus 10 µl of 2 × Laemmli buffer. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). To ensure that comparable amounts of protein were analyzed, similar volumes from cultures of similar density were loaded into each lane. Resolved proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and then detected by immunoblot analysis using antiserum Rab730 diluted 1:500 (6Hendrixson D. de la Morena M.L. Stathopoulos C. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An anti-rabbit IgG antiserum conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody, and detection of antibody binding was accomplished by incubation of the membrane in a chemiluminescent substrate solution (Pierce) and exposure to film. DB117 expressing Hap under the control of a IPTG-inducible promoter (DB117/pJS106::Trc) was grown to anA600 of 1.0, at which time IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. A 10-ml aliquot was removed from the culture every 10 min, beginning with the addition of IPTG, and proteins were isolated from the culture supernatants and outer membrane fractions as described above. In order to compensate for any differences in protein amounts caused by increases in culture density over the course of the experiment or by variations in purification efficiency, volumes loaded for resolution by SDS-PAGE were adjusted according to culture density for secreted proteins and according to final protein concentration (Bio-Rad protein assay) for outer membrane proteins. After resolution by SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose, and detection by immunoblotting, protein band intensities were quantitated by scanning densitometry using an LKB Ultroscan XL laser densitometer (Bromo, Sweden). To further ensure that protein from an equivalent number of bacterial cells had been loaded in each lane, levels of major outer membrane protein P4 (OMP P4) in each of the outer membrane fractions were quantified by scanning densitometry after detection by an anti-P4 monoclonal antibody, EPR5-2.1 (generously provided by B. Green, Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines), and anti-mouse IgG secondary antiserum conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). To inactivate the ompP2 gene in H. influenzae strain Rd, the cat cartridge from plasmid pUCΔECAT was inserted into a PvuII site contained within the ompP2 gene from type b strain DL42 on plasmid pEJH91-1-35 L3 (26Cope L.D. Pelzel S.E. Latimer J.L. Hansen E.J. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivatedompP2 gene was excised by digestion with PstI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and used to transform strain Rd. To inactivate the ompP5 gene in Rd/ompP2, a 1.5-kb PCR fragment encoding the 3′ half of the Rd ompP5gene plus 1 kb of downstream sequence was amplified from Rd chromosomal DNA, incorporating DraIII sites at each end to facilitate ligation of the fragment into DraIII-digested pUC4K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting 5.6-kb plasmid was then digested with PstI, excising a 2.8-kb fragment containing the kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K followed by the cloned portion of ompP2 and downstream sequence. This 2.8-kb fragment was then ligated into PstI-digested pUC19 (New England Biolabs), creating plasmid pUC19::kanR-P5-3′. A 1.5-kb PCR fragment encoding the 5′-half of the Rd ompP5 gene plus 1 kb of upstream sequence was amplified from Rd chromosomal DNA, incorporating anEcoRI site at the 5′ end and an XbaI site at the 3′ end to facilitate ligation of the fragment intoEcoRI-XbaI-digested pUC19:: kanR-P5-3′. The resulting 5.9-kb plasmid, pUC19::P5–5′-kanR-P5-3′, was linearized by digestion with XmnI and used to transform Rd/ompP2. Finally, the rec1 gene of Rd/ompP2/ompP5 was inactivated by transformation with DNA from strain BC200/rec1, which possesses a mutantrec1 gene linked to streptomycin resistance (27Setlow J.K. Boling M.E. Allison D.P. Beattie K.L. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 153-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Streptomycin-resistant transformants were screened for the loss of recombination activity by assaying their ability to survive exposure to 44 ergs/cm2 of ultraviolet radiation at 254 nm. Plasmid pHapLN1036-7SG::G3H6 was transformed into strain Rd/ompP2/ompP5/rec1. A 1-liter culture of Rd/ompP2/ompP5/rec1/pHapLN1036-7SG::G3H6 was grown to an A600 of 0.8, and Sarkosyl-insoluble outer membrane proteins were purified using a scaled-up version of the protocol described by Carlone et al. (24Carlone G.M. Thomas M.L. Rumschlag H.S. Sottnek F.O. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 330-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet consisting of the outer membrane fraction was resuspended in 5 ml of 20 mm Tris, 6 mguanidinium chloride, 100 mm sodium chloride, pH 8.0. 1 ml of a 50% slurry of Talon beads (CLONTECH) was added to the sample, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The Talon beads were then washed 4 times with 5 ml of 20 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 100 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and histidine-tagged outer membrane proteins were eluted from the beads in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 100 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazole, 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (28Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, three protein bands migrating at 43, 41, and 39 kDa, respectively, were excised from the membrane and submitted to Midwest Analytical (St. Louis, MO) for amino-terminal sequence determination performed by automated Edman degradation using a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems model 477A sequencing system. In considering the mechanism of Hap autoproteolysis, we first sought to identify the residues that participate with Ser243 in the Hap catalytic site. Examination of the Hap predicted amino acid sequence revealed two aspartic acid residues ∼100 residues amino-terminal to Ser243 (Asp139 and Asp140) and two histidine residues 120–140 residues amino-terminal to Ser243 (His98 and His117), reminiscent of the SA (chymotrypsin) clan of serine proteases. Alignment of Hap sequences from eight different clinical isolates of nontypable H. influenzae revealed absolute conservation of all four of these residues (data not shown). With this information in mind, we changed each of these residues individually to an alanine using site-directed mutagenesis and then expressed the resulting mutant proteins in H. influenzae strain DB117.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is composed of a catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) that complexes with an A subunit, which in turn also interacts with one of many B subunits that regulate substrate specificity and/or (sub)cellular localization of the enzyme. Another family member, protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), contains a tetratricopeptide repeat domain at its N terminus, which has been suggested to mediate interactions with other proteins. PP5 was not thought to interact with partners homologous to the A or B subunits that exist within PP2A. However, our results indicate that this may not be the case. A yeast two-hybrid screen revealed an interaction between PP5 and the A subunit of PP2A. This interaction was confirmed for endogenous proteins in vivo using immunoprecipitation analysis and for recombinant proteins by in vitro binding experiments. Our results also indicate that the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of PP5 is required and sufficient for this interaction. In addition, immunoprecipitated PP5 contains associated B subunits. Thus, our results suggest that PP5 can exist in a PP2A-like heterotrimeric form containing both A and B subunits.

It is estimated that one-third of all cellular proteins undergo reversible phosphorylation, which cells utilize to regulate the functional properties of key regulatory proteins involved in specific pathways (4Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Based on homology of amino acid sequences and the similarity of three-dimensional structures, phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs)1 are divided into three families designated PPP, PPM, and PTP (5Barford D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 407-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 6Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The PPP and PPM families are comprised of phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-specific enzymes, whereas the PTP family is comprised of phosphotyrosine-specific and/or dual specificity phosphatases. As suggested by the name, dual specificity phosphatases can dephosphorylate all three phosphoresidues (7Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) together with PP1, PP2B (calcineurin), PP4, PP5, PP6, and PP7 are classified in the PPP family (4Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). PP2A exists as a heterotrimer composed of a catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), an A subunit (also known as PR65), and a B subunit. There are three major families of B subunits, PR55/B, PR61/B′, PR72/B“, with multiple isoforms within each family (4Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 5Barford D. Trends Biochem.

The association of PP2Ac with different B subunits modulates the activity, substrate specificity, and/or (sub)cellular location of the holoenzymes, enabling them to control numerous cellular functions (3Wera S.

Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), another member of the PPP family of phosphatases, differs from the other serine/threonine phosphatases in that it contains regulatory and (sub)cellular targeting functions within a single polypeptide chain. Its C-terminal catalytic domain is related to those of PP1, PP2A, and PP2B, but its N-terminal domain consists of three tetratricopeptide repeats or TPRs that are missing from these other PPP family members (11Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4278-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). TPR domains consist of a series of antiparallel amphipathic α helices that bundle together through hydrophobic interactions to form a cradle-shaped binding groove (13Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Tetratricopeptide repeats are found not only in PP5, but also in a variety of unrelated proteins, and are thought to serve both targeting and regulatory functions. The TPR domain of PP5 interacts with a number of proteins, including the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor, Cdc 16p, and Cdc 27p (11Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Ollendorff V. Donoghue D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32011-32018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PP5 also interacts with heat shock protein 90 in complexes with glucocorticoid receptors, and it has been demonstrated that overexpression of the TPR domain of PP5 blocks glucocorticoid-induced gene transcription (15Chen M.S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Chen M.S.

Thus, PP5 has distinctive biochemical and biological properties because of its N-terminal TPR domain. We have been characterizing an interaction between the A subunit of PP2A and a member of the heat shock transcription factor family, heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) (17Hong Y. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12967-12970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Hong Y. Lubert E.J. Rodgers D.W. Sarge K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our data suggests that HSF2 competes with PP2Ac by binding to the same region of the A subunit and that HSF2 may represent a new type of PP2A regulatory protein. As a means to identify other potential regulators of PP2A that function by this mechanism, we screened a yeast two-hybrid library using the C-terminal region of the A subunit as a bait. One of the A subunit-interacting clones identified by this screen was a polypeptide encoding the TPR domain of PP5. In this present study, we began to characterize the mechanistic and structural basis for the interaction between the PP2A A subunit and PP5. We confirmed that endogenous PP5 and A subunit interact in vivo using immunoprecipitation analysis, as well as in vitro using recombinant proteins. Our results indicate that the tetratricopeptide repeat region of PP5 is sufficient for this interaction. We also found that the sequence surrounding the loop region of HEAT repeat 11 within the A subunit, which was previously shown to be important for binding to PP2Ac and HSF2, is also important for interaction with PP5 (18Hong Y. Lubert E.J. Rodgers D.W. Sarge K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Turowski P. Favre B. Campbell K.S. Lamb N.J. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that PP5 associates with B subunits in vivo, indicating that PP5 exists in a heterotrimeric form reminiscent of the PP2A enzyme. The bait construct containing PR65(205–589) (17Hong Y. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12967-12970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was made in pGBD-C1 using standard subcloning methodologies. PR65(205–589) fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain was introduced into yeast strain pJ69-4A (20James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting strain was then transformed with a mouse whole embryo cDNA library (21Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Screening was performed as described previously (17Hong Y. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12967-12970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In subsequent analysis, two-hybrid constructs for full-length PP5, TPR domain, and PP5 catalytic domain (lacking TPR domain) were made in the “target” vector pGAD-C2 and tested for ability to interact with the bait construct pGBD-PR65(205–589) in the two-hybrid assay. Empty target vector pGAD-C2 was tested as a negative control with this bait. To measure levels of wild type and mutant PR65 fusion constructs in the yeast transformed with these constructs, extracts of these yeast were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-PR65 antibodies (Santa Cruz). The HeLa (ATCC) cell line was cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter l-glucose, and 50 µg/ml gentamycin. Extracts of HeLa cells made in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) were incubated with 5 µg of PP5 mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle inversion mixing. Protein G-agarose was added and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. After collecting by centrifugation, the complexes were washed two times with RIPA buffer. The bound proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-PR65 (Santa Cruz) or anti-B subunit antibodies (generously provided by Dr. Brian Wadzinski, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University). The sequential immunoprecipitations were performed similarly using antibodies against PR65, PP5, or B“, except that two rounds of immunoprecipitation were employed. The supernatant remaining after the two rounds was concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and along with samples of pellet 1 and pellet 2 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described above. The amount of input total protein used for each of the three immunoprecipitations was 1794 µg (lysate divided in three parts), 20 µg of this extract was loaded in the lanes marked WCE, and the amounts of protein remaining after the A subunit, PP5, and B” two sequential immunoprecipitations was 1718, 1681, and 1708 µg, respectively. Aliquots of these samples were also run on SDS-PAGE and probed with the antibodies used for the immunoprecipitation to measure the amount of immunoprecipitated protein in each lane. PP5 and TPR were subcloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) to make His6 fusion proteins, while PR65(205–589) was subcloned into pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to make a GST fusion protein. The constructs, along with GST alone, were expressed in bacteria and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST (4 µg) or GST-PR65(205–589) (1 µg) were then bound to glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated with His6-TPR (3.5 µg) or His6-PP5 (3.5 µg) for 1 h at 4 °C in Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl, 20% v/v glycerol) in a total volume of 115 µl. After washing four times with Buffer D, bound TPR or PP5 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-His6 (CLONTECH) or anti-PP5/PPT (Transduction Laboratories), respectively. A bait construct containing full-length human A subunit (PR65) was made in pGBD-C1 using standard subcloning methodologies. 5′ and 3′ truncation mutants were made by performing restriction digestion of selected unique sites, filling in with Klenow, and then ligating to delete the sequences. The sites utilized wereBglII (pGBD-PR65(1–325)), Bsu36I(pGBD-PR65(1–387)), BglII (pGBD-PR65(325–589)). 3′ truncation mutants of human PR65(205–589) were generated using exonuclease III deletion as described previously (18Hong Y. Lubert E.J. Rodgers D.W. Sarge K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Single amino acid substitutions within the A subunit (PR65) protein were made using the Stratagene QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit. Using the following mutagenic primers (bold indicates the altered nucleotides, and only the sense primer is indicated). All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing: PR65 (E413A), 5′-GTGGAGCTGGCTGCGGACGCCAA- GTGG-3′; PR65 (D414A), 5′-GAGCTGGCTGAGGCGGCCAAGTGGCGG-3′; PR65 (A415Y), 5′-CTGGCTGAGGACTACAAGTGGCGGGTG-3′; PR65 (K416A), 5′-GCTGAGGACGCCGCGTGGCGGGTGCGG-3′; PR65 (W417A), 5′-GAGGACGCCAAGGCGCGGGTGCGGCTG-3′; PR65- (R418A), 5′-GACGCCAAGTGGGCGGTGCGGCTGGCC-3′; PR65 (L421A), 5′-TGGCGGGTGCGGGCGGCCATCATTGAG-3′. For analysis of β-galactosidase activity in yeast harboring two-hybrid constructs, yeast extracts were incubated with Z Buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4 and 40 mmNaH2PO4, pH = 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). After addition of 4 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside substrate, samples were incubated at 30 °C for ∼30–45 min and then theA420 was measured. To identify potential PP2A regulatory proteins, a mouse whole embryo cDNA library was screened using a C-terminal portion of the A subunit of PP2A (PR65(205–589)) as the bait (Fig.1A) (20James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 22Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (4838) Google Scholar). This truncated form of the A subunit does not contain the region responsible for binding the B subunits, and thus we were able to focus on identifying proteins that bind to the C-terminal region of the A subunit. One of the positives identified was a clone containing an N-terminal portion of PP5 comprising amino acids 7–139, which will hereafter be referred to as TPR(7–139) (Fig. 1B) (12Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4278-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this portion of PP5 contains most of the TPR domain of this protein. The domain organization of PP5 relative to PP2Ac, which lacks these N-terminal TPR repeats, is shown in Fig. 1C. To further characterize this interaction, a full-length clone of PP5, as well as the N-terminal TPR domain (comprising amino acids 1–159), the original PP5 partial clone (TPR(7–139)), and the C-terminal catalytic domain of PP5 (Cat), were tested for their ability to interact with PR65(205–589) using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Yeast transformed with the A subunit bait PR65(205–589) + PP5 as well as those transformed with PR65(205–589) + TPR(1–159) or PR65(205–589) + TPR(7–139) all grew on selective media, indicating the existence of an interaction (Fig.2). Yeast transformed with the A subunit bait PR65(205–589) + Cat, PR65(205–589) + empty target vectors pGAD-C2 or pVP16, as well as those transformed with the empty bait vector (pGBD) and the aforementioned target constructs, all failed to grow on selective media (Fig. 2). These results support the hypothesis that the TPR domain of PP5 interacts with the A subunit of PP2A. To determine whether endogenous PP5 and A subunit proteins interact, we immunoprecipitated PP5 from extracts of HeLa cells followed by Western blot using anti-A subunit antibodies. As a negative control we also subjected these extracts to immunoprecipitation using nonspecific mouse IgG antibodies and probed for A subunit. The results indicate that PP5 is found in a complex with A subunit in vivo (Fig.3A), while little or no A subunit was immunoprecipitated by the negative control IgG antibodies. To determine the proportion of total endogenous cellular PP5 and A subunit that are associated, we subjected extracts of HeLa cells to sequential immunoprecipitations. To measure the efficiency of immunoprecipitation we also subjected each of these samples to Western blot using the antibody used to immunoprecipitate. The results of the A subunit immunoprecipitation (Western probed for PP5) indicate that a significant proportion of cellular PP5 does appear to immunoprecipitate with A subunit in the two sequential immunoprecipitations (Pellet 1 (P1) and Pellet 2 (P2)) (Fig. 3B). A fraction of PP5 does appear in the supernatant (lane marked “S”), but so does a fraction of the cellular PR65 (seelower panel), indicating that our immunoprecipitation was not able to pull down all of this protein, possibly due at least in part to the association of PR65 with cellular substructures such as microtubules. Thus it is unclear whether this fraction of PP5 remaining in the supernatant is complexed with A subunit or not. The reverse experiment, in which PP5 antibodies were used in two sequential immunoprecipitations followed by Western blot using A subunit antibodies, reveals that while some of the cellular A subunit clearly immunoprecipitates with PP5 (most in the first immunoprecipitation (IP)-Pellet 1 (P1)) a substantial proportion remains in the supernatant and thus appears not to be associated with PP5 (Fig. 3C). This is expected as a large proportion of cellular A subunit is associated with PP2A catalytic subunit and thus would not be immunoprecipitated by PP5 antibodies. As a complementary approach we also tested the ability of recombinant PP5 and A subunit proteins to interact in vitro using a GST pull-down assay. GST or GST-PR65(205–589) were bound to glutathione-agarose, incubated with purified recombinant 6xHis-TPR(1–159) or 6xHis-PP5, and washed extensively. The binding of 6×His-PP5 or 6×His-TPR(1–159) was then measured by Western blot analysis using either PP5 antibodies or 6×His antibodies, respectively. The results of this experiment demonstrate that both PP5 (Fig. 4A) and its TPR domain (Fig. 4B) interact in vitro with recombinant A subunit, but not with GST alone. Similar interactions with PP5 and TPR domain were observed using GST fusion proteins containing full-length A subunit (data not shown). These data provide additional evidence of the PP5-A subunit interaction and support the hypothesis that the TPR domain of PP5 is the region responsible for interacting with the A subunit. To better understand the interaction between PP5 and the A subunit, we determined the regions within the A subunit polypeptide that are important for this interaction by constructing 3′ truncation mutants of full-length A subunit and testing their ability to interact with TPR(7–139) in the yeast two-hybrid system. The results demonstrate that 3′ truncation mutants of the A subunit that terminate at amino acids 378 and 325 are unable to interact with TPR(7–139) (Fig.5A). We also tested 3′ truncation mutants of the portion of the A subunit (PR65(205–589)) used as bait during the initial library screen. We found that 3′ truncation mutants that terminate at amino acid 426 were able to interact with TPR(7–139), but that further deletion to amino acid 408 rendered this protein unable to interact (Fig. 5A). Finally, we tested a 5′ truncation mutant of full-length A subunit that begins at amino acid 325 and found that it too was unable to interact with TPR(7–139) (Fig.5A). These results suggest that the region within the A subunit between amino acids 205 and 426 is important for interaction with the TPR domain of PP5 (Fig. 5B). As indicated in Fig. 5B, amino acids 205–426 of the A subunit overlap the region of this protein previously shown to be involved in interacting with PP2Ac (amino acids 408–426) (19Turowski P. Favre B. Campbell K.S. Lamb N.J. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the region of overlap contains a loop region in HEAT repeat 11 of the A subunit that we and others have demonstrated to be important for interaction with PP2Ac (18Hong Y. Lubert E.J. Rodgers D.W. Sarge K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Turowski P. Favre B. Campbell K.S. Lamb N.J. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This prompted us to speculate that amino acids within this loop region of the A subunit may also be important for interaction with the TPR domain of PP5. To test this hypothesis we analyzed point mutants within this region for their ability to interact with the TPR domain of PP5 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, as measured by β-galactosidase activity in yeast extracts. The mutations made were all alanine substitutions except for alanine 415, which was changed to tyrosine to determine the effect of substituting a bulky side chain for the small alanine side chain. As shown in Fig.6A, mutations of aspartic acid 414 (D414A) and leucine 421(L421A) resulted in a small reduction in β-galactosidase activity relative to wild type A subunit, suggesting that these residues could be involved in the interaction with the TPR domain of PP5. Somewhat to our surprise, mutation of four other residues led to either a moderate (E413A) or large (K416A, W417A, R418A) increase in β-galactosidase activity. We postulate that the side chains of these particular residues in this region of the A subunit are deleterious to its interaction with the TPR domain, perhaps because of steric or ionic repulsions between them and groups in the TPR domain that are then relieved when these side chains are changed to that of alanine. The A415Y mutation resulted in only a small increase in β-galactosidase activity. To rule out the possibility that significant differences in expression of any of the mutants in yeast could account for differences in β-galactosidase activity we observed, we performed Western blot of yeast containing each of the A subunit constructs with A subunit antibodies and did not observe any large differences in levels that could account for the results (Fig.6B), which are summarized in Fig. 6C. The PP2A heterotrimer contains a B subunit that associates with the N-terminal domain of the A subunit. Our finding that PP5 interacts with the A subunit prompted us to examine whether this complex also contains a B subunit. To test this hypothesis we immunoprecipitated PP5 complexes from extracts of HeLa cells and probed Western blots of the immunoprecipitate with antibodies that recognize different B subunits. As shown in Fig. 7A, we found that a member of the B“ family, PR72, immunoprecipitates with PP5. A control IgG does not immunoprecipitate this protein, indicating specificity. We were unable to detect any B subunit isomers from the PR55/B or PR56/B′ family (data not shown). Sequential immunoprecipitation analysis of this association of B” with PP5 revealed that, similar to what was observed for the proportion of cellular A subunit associated with PP5 and consistent with our expectation (see Fig. 3C), while we can clearly detect a fraction of B“ associated with PP5 (Pellet 1 (P1)) there remains a large fraction of B” not associated with PP5 (supernatant (S)) (Fig. 7B), even though the immunoprecipitation appears to have efficiently pulled down the B“ protein in the extracts (lower panel). Again, this is consistent with the expectation that a substantial portion of B” is found in PP2A heterotrimers in the cell and is not associated with this complex. It is also possible that other B subunits besides those we tested are associated in some A subunit-PP5 complexes. However, our results do suggest that the “PP5-A subunit heterodimer” associates with at least one B subunit in vivo to form novel heterotrimeric complexes containing PP5, A subunit, and a B subunit. Based on our results, we propose that PP5 can exist in a native complex in vivo with the A subunit of PP2A and a B subunit, like that of the PP2A heterotrimer (Fig.8). Our data also suggest that PP5 binds to the A subunit via its N-terminal TPR domain, although it is possible that contacts between the catalytic domain of PP5 and the A subunit may also contribute to this interaction. Eukaryotic cells express a large number of different protein kinases. However, the number of genes encoding protein phosphatases is limited and does not appear to equal the diversity of the protein kinases. Furthermore, it has been estimated that approximately one-third of all cellular proteins undergo reversible phosphorylation. A major question, then, is how such a limited number of dephosphorylating enzymes can counterbalance the action of so many protein kinases. The idea has developed that proteins that regulate protein phosphatases are key players in determining the properties of the enzyme. Our data may help answer this question as it suggests a “modular” design of phosphatases in the PPP family such that one catalytic subunit can be replaced by another. This could represent one mechanism for generating diversity of function among this family of protein phosphatases. Our data also illustrate the fact that TPR domains and HEAT domains can interact. These two domains, both of which are involved in protein-protein interactions, are structurally similar in that they are both composed of antiparallel amphipathic α helices (24Groves M.R. Barford D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, TPR motifs generate extended surface grooves, while surface grooves are not a feature of tandem HEAT repeats (24Groves M.R. Barford D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 25Kobe B. Gleichmann T. Horne J. Jennings I.G. Scotney P.D. Teh T. Struct.

Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Instead, HEAT repeats generate a ridge-like motif, which creates an interaction interface (24Groves M.R. Barford D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 25Kobe B. Gleichmann T. Horne J. Jennings I.G. Scotney P.D. Teh T. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: R91-R97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, TPR and HEAT motifs illustrate how a common structural repeat unit can assemble related motifs to create different structures. In summary, our findings indicate a relationship between the native complexes formed by PP5 and PP2A in cells. Further studies to characterize this relationship should increase understanding of how phosphatase functions are regulated within the cell.

A., Rieger, M., te Heesen, S., Ram, A. F., van den Ende, H., Aebi, M., and Klis, F. M. (1999) Glycobiology 9, 243–253). Genetic, enzymological, and topological approaches were taken to investigate the potential role of Cwh8p in Dol-P-P/Dol-P metabolism. Overexpression of Cwh8p in the yeast double mutant strain, lacking LPP1/DPP1, resulted in an impressive increase in Dol-P-P phosphatase activity, a relatively small increase in Dol-P phosphatase activity, but no change in phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase activity in microsomal fractions. The Dol-P-P phosphatase encoded by CWH8 is optimally active in the presence of 0.5% octyl glucoside and relatively unstable in Triton X-100, distinguishing this activity from the lipid phosphatases encoded by LPP1 and DPP1. Stoichiometric amounts of Pi and Dol-P are formed during the enzymatic reaction indicating that Cwh8p cleaves the anhydride linkage in Dol-P-P. Membrane fractions from Sf-9 cells expressing Cwh8p contained a 30-fold higher level of Dol-P-P phosphatase activity, a slight increase in Dol-P phosphatase activity, but no increase in PA phosphatase relative to controls. This is the first report of a lipid phosphatase that hydrolyzes Dol-P-P/Dol-P but not PA. In accord with this enzymatic function, Dol-P-P accumulated in cells lacking the Dol-P-P phosphatase. Topological studies using different approaches indicate that Cwh8p is a transmembrane protein with a luminally oriented active site. The specificity, subcellular location, and topological orientation of this novel enzyme are consistent with a role in the re-utilization of the glycosyl carrier lipid for additional rounds of lipid intermediate biosynthesis after its release during proteinN-glycosylation reactions.

For the dolichyl moiety of Dol-P-P to be re-utilized for additional rounds of lipid intermediate biosynthesis, it must be converted to Dol-P before or after returning to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER. There have been many reports of Dol-P-P phosphatase activities in microsomal fractions from mammalian tissues (see reports cited in Ref.3Schenk B. Fernandez F. Waechter C.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 61R-71RCrossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, the subcellular location and topological arrangement of the active sites of these enzymes have not been definitively established. A Dol-P-P phosphatase activity reported in brain (4Wolf M.J. Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is curiously enriched in Golgi fractions and is an unlikely candidate to be involved in the recycling of Dol-P-P. The LPP1 andDPP1 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which have homology to a Mg2+-independent phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase, have been shown to encode enzymes capable of converting Dol-P-P to Dol-P and dephosphorylating Dol-P, as well as PAin vitro (5Toke D.A.

However, because there are no growth or protein N- or O-glycosylation defects associated with mutations in these enzymes, it is doubtful that Dol-P-P and/or Dol-P are the primary substrates in vivo. Recently, van Berkel et al. (8van Berkel M.A. Rieger M. te Heesen S. Ram A.F. van den Ende H. Aebi M. Klis F.M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) isolated a cwh8mutant from S. cerevisiae using a broad cell wall mutant screen and demonstrated that it is deficient in the synthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide intermediates and proteinN-glycosylation. CWH8 encodes a putative ER transmembrane protein of 239 amino acid residues with a lipid phosphate binding pocket, raising the possibility that it could plausibly be involved in Dol-P-P/Dol-P metabolism. To explore this potential function, we have conducted enzymological and topological studies with the yeast double mutant, Δlpp1Δdpp1, and Sf-9 cells expressing CWH8. By expressing Cwh8p in the yeast double mutant and Sf-9 cells, it was possible to distinguish the properties and specificity of this novel lipid phosphatase from the enzymes encoded byLPP1/DPP1. The enzymatic studies presented here reveal that CWH8 encodes a Dol-P-P phosphatase that was previously overlooked because of its characteristic lability in the presence of Triton X-100 under conditions that are optimal for the lipid phosphatases encoded by LPP1/DPP1. These results provide solid evidence that CWH8 encodes an enzyme, which can be readily assayed in vitro in the presence of 0.5% octyl glucoside (OG), capable of converting Dol-P-P to Dol-P and Pi on the luminal surface of the ER in yeast. The support for these conclusions and the possible role of the enzyme in the recycling of the glycosyl carrier lipid for additional rounds of lipid intermediate synthesis are discussed. Some aspects of this study have been presented in preliminary form (9Rush J.S. Toke D.A. Gil-soo H. Quinn J. Carman G.M. Jae-yeon C. Voelker D.R. Aebi M. Waechter C.J.

The appropriate amino acid of complete synthetic medium was omitted for selection purposes. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was grown in LB medium (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (100 mg/ml) was added to cultures of DH5α-carrying plasmids. Plasmid and genomic DNA preparation, restriction enzyme digestion, and DNA ligations were performed by standard methods (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Conditions for the amplification of DNA by PCR were optimized as described elsewhere (14Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 1-482Google Scholar). The annealing temperature for the PCRs was 55 °C, and extension times were typically between 2.0 and 2.5 min at 72 °C. PCRs were routinely run for a total of 30 cycles. DNA sequencing reactions were performed with the Prism DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and analyzed with an automated DNA sequencer. Plasmid maintenance and amplifications were performed in E. coli strain DH5α. A DNA fragment containing the entire CWH8 gene, including 863 bp of the putative promoter and 233 bp of the 3′ flanking sequence, was obtained by PCR (primers: 5′-GAAAAGGGGTATACTGGATCCATGTAAGG -3′ and 5′-GAACTCACATTTAGTCGACGTTCTGGCATGG -3′) using W303-1A (15Thomas B.

The forward and reverse primers contained altered bases to construct silent BamHI and SalI restriction sites, respectively, for cloning purposes. The PCR product was digested with BamHI/SalI to yield a 1.6-kb DNA fragment. This fragment was then ligated into theBamHI/SalI sites of plasmid YEp352, a multicopyE. coli yeast shuttle vector containing the URA3gene (16Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A.

A DNA fragment containing the coding sequence of theCWH8 gene and its 3′-untranslated region was obtained by PCR (primers: 5′-GTTTTGAATCGGATGAATTCATGAATAGTACCG-3′ and 5′-GGCTTTCGGATCCCTTTATGAGAAATAGG-3′) using strain W303-1A genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was digested withEcoRI/BamHI and then ligated into the same restriction enzyme sites of the baculovirus vector pVL1392 to form plasmid pGH1-CWH8. The correct sequence of the CWH8 gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pGH1-CWH8 plasmid was subsequently co-transfected with BaculoGold Autographa californica DNA (PharMingen) into a monolayer of Sf-9 cells using the CaCl2method. The Sf-9 cells were routinely grown in Trichoplusia ni medium with yeastolate and lactalbumin hydrolysate (TMN-FH) medium (17O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Insect Cell Culture. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. General procedures for the growth, maintenance, and infection of Sf-9 cells followed the methods described by O'Reillyet al. (17O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Insect Cell Culture. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar). Routine infection of Sf-9 cells forCWH8 expression used 1–2 × 107 cells grown in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks. The cells were infected at a viral multiplicity of 10 and grown in TMN-FH medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for 48 h. The infected cells were collected by gentle trituration with medium, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The final cell pellet was snap-frozen over dry ice and stored at −80 °C. [32P]Dioleoyl-PA, [32P]Dol-P, [α,β-32P]Dol-P-P, [β-32P]Dol-P-P, and [β-32P]Poly-P-P were chemically synthesized in anhydrous acetonitrile from the appropriate lipid using [32P]tetrabutylammonium phosphate and trichloroacetonitrile as described by Danilov et al.(18Danilov L.L.

Nonradioactive polyisoprenyl phosphates were synthesized employing tetrabutylammonium phosphate. Dioleoyl-PA was obtained from Sigma- Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Synthetic substrates were purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography on Baker Si250 thin-layer plates developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (65:35:6:1, v/v) and quantitated by lipid-phosphorus analysis according to Bartlett (19Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains were routinely grown in liquid culture containing Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco), 50 mm sodium succinate (pH 5.0), 4% glucose, amino acids (25 mg/liter) and purine/pyrimidine bases (25 mg/liter) as required. Yeast cultures were grown to an A600 of ∼1.0 and sedimented by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min). The cell pellets were washed by resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline and re-sedimented. The cell pellets were washed in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and resuspended in this buffer to ∼100 A600/ml. Cells were then lysed at 0–4 °C by shaking (five 1-min cycles) in a Braun homogenizer with glass beads (5 mm). Following removal of unbroken cells and dense organelles by sedimentation at 10,000 × g, 10 min, heavy microsomes were collected by centrifugation at 39,000 × g, 20 min. Yeast microsomes were resuspended to a membrane protein concentration of 10–20 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol and stored at −20 °C until used for enzyme assays. The lipid phosphatase activities were assayed essentially by the procedures described previously (4Wolf M.J. Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7Faulkner A.J. Chen X. Rush J. Horazdovsky B. Waechter C.J. Carman G.M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol.

Yeast cells were disrupted with glass beads with a Mini-Bead-Beater (Biospec Products) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm disodium EDTA, 0.3m sucrose, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (20Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was used as the cell extract. [β-32P]Diacylglycerol pyrophosphate was synthesized enzymatically using Catharanthus roseus PA kinase (21Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase activity was assayed by following the release of 32Pi from the radiolabeled substrate (10,000–20,000 cpm/nmol) (21Wu W.-I.

The reaction mixture contained 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.1 mm diacylglycerol pyrophosphate, 2 mm Triton X-100, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. All enzyme assays were conducted at 30 °C in triplicate. Wild type (SS328) and Δcwh8 (YG 1001) strains were grown in YPD to anA600 nm of ∼1.5. Cells were collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in water, and total lipids were extracted twice with 5 volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). The organic solvent was evaporated, and the sample was redissolved in 2 ml of CH3OH-toluene (1:1) and 2 ml of 0.2 n KOH in CH3OH. Samples were incubated at 0 °C for 60 min and were neutralized with 0.4 ml of 1 n acetic acid. CHCl3(4 ml) and 1.3 ml of 0.9% NaCl were added and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lower phase (organic) was washed twice with CHCl3/CH3OH/0.9% NaCl (3:48:47). The washed lower phase was dried under an atmosphere of N2. The lipid sample was dissolved in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) and loaded onto a DEAE Toyo-Pearl column (0.5 × 5 cm). The column was washed sequentially with 10 volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3), 5 volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) with 2 and 20 mm ammonium acetate to elute Dol-P. Then Dol-P-P was eluted with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) with 200 mm ammonium acetate. To convert Dol-P-P to Dol-P, the pertinent fractions were subjected to strong alkaline hydrolysis (3m KOH in 40% methanol, 100 °C, 60 min). Dol-P was extracted after the addition of 12 ml of methanol and 48 ml of dichloromethane to the hydrolysate, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 40 °C. The organic (lower) phase was removed and washed four times with equal volumes of dichloromethane/methanol/water (3:48:47). The washed organic phase was dried under N2, and lipids were dissolved in isopropanol/methanol/water (65:30:5) containing 20 mm H3PO4. Each sample was analyzed in a LiChrospher 100 reversed-phase C-18 column. The mobile phase, isopropanol/methanol/water (65:30:5), containing 20 mm H3PO4 for Dol-P, was run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Samples were injected using an autosampling device (Merck/Hitachi AS-2000A), and Dol-P standards with 15 and 18 isoprene units were used for co-migration experiments (not shown). Dol-P and Dol-P-P were detected by absorption at 214 nm with a Merck/Hitachi L-4250 UV-visible detector. Two different fragments of CWH8gene were amplified by PCR. The upper primer, CuF (5′-TTGAGGTACCGAATTCGGGTTTCTGG, KpnI site is underlined), and two different lower primers corresponding to positions +474 (ClF-III 5′-CGGACTCGAGGTAGTGCAAGTAAACTC,XhoI site is underlined) and +717 (ClF-IV 5′-CGGACTCGAGATCCCTTTTGGATTTATC, XhoI site is underlined) were used. PCR products were digested with KpnI and XhoI. pCS4-14 (22Sengstag C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23te Heesen S. Lehle L. Weissmann A. Aebi M. Eur.

These plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain FC2a, and Ura+ transformants were assayed for growth on minimal media agar plates containing either 0.1 mm histidine or 6 mm histidinol. Yeast cells were grown to anA600 of ∼1.0 and converted to spheroplasts by incubation at 30 °C in a solution containing 1 msorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml Lyticase (Sigma-Aldrich). Following a 30-min incubation, spheroplasts were recovered by sedimentation at 5000 × g, 10 min, and the supernatant was poured off. Spheroplasts were lysed by resuspension in 20 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, incubated on ice for 30 min, and homogenized by 12 strokes with a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The yeast lysate was supplemented with 2 m sucrose to a final sucrose concentration of 0.25 m. After removal of unbroken cells and debris by centrifugation at 2500 ×g, 10 min, yeast microsomes were recovered from the supernatant by sedimentation at 39,000 × g for 20 min. Yeast microsomes were rapidly frozen and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The intactness of the ER-enriched microsomal vesicles used for the topological studies was determined by comparing the amount of latent processing glucosidase I/II activity detected in sealed microsomes with microsomes unsealed by treatment with Triton X-100 (24Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Glucosidase I/II activity was assayed in reaction mixtures containing microsomes (40–50 µg of protein), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25m sucrose, and [3H]Glc3Man9GlcNAc2(8000 cpm) in the presence or absence of 0.2% Triton X-100 in a total volume of 0.02 ml. After 10–20 min at 21 °C, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.08 ml of 95% ethanol. Ethanol-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation in a Costar microcentrifuge, and an aliquot was diluted with 0.5 ml 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2 (Con A buffer). The amount of free [3H]glucose released was determined by chromatography on a Con A-Sepharose column (24Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Sf-9 cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 1000 × g, 10 min, resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 m sucrose per milliliter of packed cells and lysed by sonication (four 15-s pulses) with a Kontes Micro Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor at 40% full power. Unbroken cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 1000 ×g, 10 min. Microsomes were then sedimented (100,000 ×g, 10 min) in a Beckman Tl-100 table-top ultracentrifuge and resuspended at a membrane protein concentration of ∼10 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 m sucrose. Protein was determined by the method of Rodriquez-Vico et al. (25Rodriquez-Vico F. Martinez-Cayeula M. Garcia-Peregrin E. Ramirez H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The amount of radioactivity in each sample was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry in a Tri-Carb TR-2100 liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) in the presence of Econo-Safe Biodegradable Counting Mixture (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). The CWH8 gene was isolated by PCR amplification using genomic DNA from strain W303-1A as the template. The gene was then used to construct a multicopy plasmid for the overexpression of the CWH8 gene product in wild type and Δlpp1Δdpp1 mutant cells. CWH8 was expressed in the Δlpp1Δdpp1 mutant so that its properties could be readily distinguished from the lipid phosphate phosphatase activities encoded by the DPP1 andLPP1 genes. In vitro, the DPP1 andLPP1 gene products account for most of the Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase, lysophosphatidate phosphatase, isoprenoid phosphatase activities, and all of the diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase activity of S. cerevisiae (5Toke D.A.

To further examine the activity encoded by the CWH8 gene product, we used heterologous expression of the CWH8 gene in Sf-9 insect cells. The CWH8 gene was placed within the genome of baculovirus under control of the polyhedrin promoter and expressed by viral infection of Sf-9 cells.Table IYeast strains used in these studies and their genotypes A recent study has indicated that the lipid phosphatases encoded by LPP1 and DPP1 are responsible for virtually all of the isoprenyl mono- and pyrophosphatase activities in yeast microsomes when assayed in the presence of Triton X-100 (7Faulkner A.J.

However, the observation that the Δlpp1Δdpp1 double mutant had no growth or protein N- or O-glycosylation defect suggested that yeast contained other lipid phosphatases capable of dephosphorylating Dol-P/Dol-P-P in vivo that were not detected when assayed in vitro in the presence of Triton X-100. In an attempt to evaluate the potential role of Cwh8p in Dol-P/Dol-P-P metabolism, microsomal fractions were prepared from the Δlpp1Δdpp1 double mutant overexpressingCWH8 to explore the possibility that the CWH8gene encoded a lipid phosphatase with different properties and substrate specificity than the enzymes encoded byLPP1/DPP1. A preliminary screen of various detergents indicated that microsomes from the Δlpp1Δdpp1/CWH8 strain contained a lipid phosphatase that was unstable in the presence of Triton X-100 but active in the presence of OG with optimal activity seen at 0.5%. The initial experiments also revealed that Dol-P-P was an excellent substrate, and it was used for further enzymatic analyses. As seen in Fig. 1, the Dol-P-P phosphatase encoded by CWH8 was extremely labile when preincubated in the presence of Triton X-100 (panel A, open circles), but the activity encoded by LPP1/DPP1 was quite stable (panel A, closed circles), as reported previously (7Faulkner A.J.

The Dol-P phosphatase encoded byLPP1/DPP1 was also active and stable in the presence of Triton X-100 (panel B, closed circles) whereas the Dol-P phosphatase activity in the microsomes from the Δlpp1Δdpp1 double mutant expressingCWH8 was barely detectable when the lipophilic substrate was dispersed in Triton X-100 (panel B, open circles). These results provide a tenable explanation of why theCWH8-related Dol-P-P/Dol-P phosphatase activity was overlooked in previous in vitro studies (5Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Dillon D.A. Chen X.

When the concentration of OG was varied, a fairly sharp optimum was seen at 0.3–0.5% (w/v). The Dol-P-P phosphatase apparently does not have a strict divalent cation requirement, because the reaction was not affected by an excess of EDTA. A very modest stimulation was observed variably with 2 mm MgCl2. When assayed in the presence of OG, The CWH8 Dol-P-P phosphatase exhibited a broad pH optimum between 6 and 7. To examine the specificity of the lipid phosphatase encoded by CWH8, in vitro assays were conducted with micros"
https://openalex.org/W2038791554,"A human genetic disorder, Tangier disease, has been linked recently to mutations in ATP-binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1). In addition to its function in apoprotein A-I-mediated lipid removal, ABCA1 was also shown to be a phosphatidylserine (PS) translocase that facilitates PS exofacial flipping. This PS translocation is crucial for the plasma membrane to produce protrusions enabling the engulfment of apoptotic cells. In this report, we show that ABCA1 also plays a role in endocytosis. Receptor-mediated endocytosis, probed by both transferrin and low density lipoprotein, is up-regulated by more than 50% in homozygous Tangier fibroblasts in comparison with controls. Fluid-phase uptake is increased similarly. We also demonstrate that bulk membrane flow, including lipid endocytosis and exocytosis, is accelerated greatly in Tangier cells. Moreover, endocytosis is similarly enhanced in normal fibroblasts when ABCA1 function is inhibited by glyburide, whereas glyburide has no effect on endocytosis in Tangier cells. In addition, we demonstrate a decreased annexin V binding in Tangier fibroblasts as compared with controls, supporting the notion that PS transmembrane distribution is indeed defective in the presence of ABCA1 mutations. Furthermore, adding a PS analog to the exofacial leaflet of the plasma membrane normalizes endocytosis in Tangier cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ABCA1 plays an important role in endocytosis. We speculate that this is related to the PS translocase function of ABCA1. A loss of functional ABCA1, as in the case of Tangier cells, enhances membrane inward bending and facilitates endocytosis.

Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This family of transporters consists, minimally, of a highly conserved ABC-ATPase and a much less conserved multimembrane-spanning domain. By hydrolyzing ATP, ABC transporters are capable of transporting a wide variety of substrates including lipids across the membrane. The substrate specificity of ABC transporters is thought to be determined by the nature of the membrane-spanning domains. In humans, several clinical disorders are linked to defects in ABC transporters (2Schmitz G. Kaminski W.E. Orso E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Tangier disease is a rare genetic disorder in humans characterized by extremely low plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoprotein A-I (3Assman G. Schmitz G. Brewer H.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet L.A. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1267-1282Google Scholar). The absence of high density lipoprotein in Tangier patients was attributed to the impairment of apoprotein A-I-mediated cholesterol efflux (4Schmitz G. Assmann G. Robenek H. Brennhausen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6305-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recently, several mutations in ABCA1 have been linked genetically to the disease (5Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M.

The mechanisms by which ABCA1 facilitates apoprotein A-I-mediated lipid efflux, however, remain largely unknown. ABCA1 may serve as a receptor on the cell surface for apo-AI as indicated by chemical crosslinking studies (11Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 12Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Apo-AI and ABCA1, however, were shown to have rather distinct diffusional coefficients on the plasma membrane, indicating that direct interaction between apo-AI and ABCA1 is limited (13Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). ABCA1 is known to specifically transport phosphatidylserine (PS) from the internal leaflet of the plasma membrane to the exofacial leaflet (PS translocase) (14Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This could influence the lipid microenvironment on the cell surface and may sequentially facilitate apoprotein A-I binding (13Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, the plasma membrane, together with endosomal membranes, is the main reservoir of cellular free cholesterol (15Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Endosomal membrane trafficking may be linked directly to apo-AI-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux (16Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that impairment of PS translocase caused by functional mutations in ABCA1 or inhibition of ABCA1 would result in the alteration in endosomal membrane trafficking. In the present report, we provide evidence demonstrating that a loss of functional ABCA1 results in an increase in endocytosis. Both receptor-mediated endocytosis and fluid-phase uptake are enhanced in Tangier fibroblasts. Membrane recycling in the endosomal system is also accelerated. Importantly, this enhanced endocytosis can be duplicated in normal fibroblasts by pharmacologically inhibiting ABCA1 function. Furthermore, endocytosis in Tangier cells can be attenuated by lyso-PS, a phospholipid analog specifically inserted into the exofacial leaflet of the plasma membrane. Tangier fibroblasts (TD1 and TD2) and two normal control fibroblasts (N1 and N2) were obtained from Dr. J. Oram (Washington University, Seattle, WA). These cells were immortalized by transfection with human papillomaviruses E6 and E7 (17Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Lymp J. Kavanagh T.J. Halbert C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1769-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another independent Tangier primary fibroblast cell line (TD3) and two normal control primary fibroblast cell lines (N3 and N4), characterized by one of the authors (J. G.) were also studied. The described mutations were as follows: TD1, Arg-527 to tryptophan (homozygous), and TD2, Gln-537 to arginine (a compound heterozygote in which the second allele failed to produce detectable mRNA) (18Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R25-R31Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). TD3 was a compound heterozygote. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 milliunits/ml). Cells were used before 20 passages. 2–3 days before experiments, cells were seeded onto 35-mm coverslip-bottom dishes coated with poly-lysine (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). LDL was obtained from the sera of healthy individuals by density centrifugation. DiI-LDL was prepared as described (19Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human transferrin (Sigma) was column-purified and Cy3-labeled following manufacturer instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All the fluorescent reagents were checked by competition experiments with unlabeled materials. Fluorescein dextran (70 kDa), BODIPY-C5-SM, FM 1-43, and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated annexin V were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Glyburide was from Sigma, and 1-oleyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3[phospho-l-serine] (lyso-phosphatidylserine or lyso-PS) was from Avanti Polarlipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). All live cell experiments were carried out in medium 1 (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) plus either BSA or glucose. Cells were grown 2–3 days on coverslip dishes before the experiments. For LDL uptake, cells were changed into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum overnight to up-regulate LDL receptors. For all uptake experiments, the cells were preincubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/HEPES plus 2 mg/ml BSA for 10 min at 37 °C followed by either Cy3-transferrin (Tf) (10 µg/ml) for 10 min or DiI-LDL (10 µg/ml) for 30 min in the same medium. The cells were then rinsed three times by PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Surface receptor binding was performed by incubating cells on ice with Cy3-Tf or DiI-LDL for 30 min. This was followed by PBS rinses and fixation on ice with paraformaldehyde. Fluid-phase endocytosis was measured by incubating cells with fluorescein-dextran (5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells then were rinsed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Liposomes containing BODIPY-C5-SM were made by mixing BODIPY-C5-SM and dioleylphosphatidylcholine, both in ethanol, by a molar ratio of 2:3. The mixture was then dried under N2 and redissolved in ethanol. Liposome stock (20 mm total lipid concentration) was produced by rapidly injecting lipid mixture into medium 1 while vortexing followed by dialyzing against PBS overnight at 4 °C to remove the ethanol. Cell surface membrane labeling was achieved by incubating cells with liposomes in medium 1 (50 µm total lipid concentration) on ice for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times on ice before chasing at 37 °C for 10 or 30 min to allow endocytosis to occur. Cells were cooled down to 4 °C immediately and washed with ice-cold medium 1 containing 5% fatty acid-free BSA (six times and five min each) to remove remaining surface label. This was followed by a light fix with paraformaldehyde on ice, and the cells were examined immediately by microscopy. For membrane recycling, cells were incubated with FM 1-43 (10 µm) in medium 1 plus 2 mg/ml glucose for 15 min at 37 °C to label the endosomal system. Cells were rinsed three times with room temperature dye-free medium/glucose to remove surface-associated dye. Cells were then chased on the microscope stage maintained at 32–34 °C, and a time series of fluorescence images was acquired at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 min. Both control and Tangier cells were preincubated on ice for more than 30 min. Cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated annexin (1:5 dilution from manufacturer stock) in medium 1 for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with cold PBS, cells were lysed with 2% Triton X-100. The lysates were measured for fluorescence using a spectrofluorometer, RTC-2000 (Photon Technology International, Inc., Princeton, NJ). The protein contents in the lysates were determined by the Lowry assay. Most experiments reported in this paper involved fluorescence intensity measurement following a procedure described earlier (20Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R Foskette J.K. Grinstein S. Nonivasive Techniques in Cell Biology. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 153-176Google Scholar, 21Zha X. Tabas I. Leopold P.L. Jones N.L. Maxfield F.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The measurement was performed on an Olympus IX50 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled 12-bits CCD camera (microMax, Princeton Instruments). Images were acquired with a 40× (0.75 numerical aperture) objective to collect fluorescence from the entire cell thickness. Total fluorescence intensity of each image was measured using Winview, the program that also drives the CCD camera. After background correction, the total fluorescence intensity of each image was then divided by the number of cells (∼20–30 cells for fibroblasts) in the image to give a mean fluorescence intensity/cell (FI/cell). Each data point represented an average of 5–8 such images (∼200 cells). For membrane recycling experiments, a time series of images was taken from each dish of cells, and 4–5 dishes were used for each cell line. For each dish, fluorescence intensity at time 0 was counted as 100% or normalized to 1. Fluorescence intensities at each time point were normalized according to initial fluorescence intensity (FIt/FIinitial) to give relative FI. The data are the average relative FIs at each time point from 3 or 4 dishes. Curve fitting was a single exponential decay using SigmaPlot. Because ABCA1 has been shown to influence lipid distribution in the plasma membrane, we first asked if the inhibition of ABCA1 would affect endocytosis. Normal human fibroblasts were preincubated with glyburide for 30 min and then incubated with Tf in the presence of glyburide for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. Tf uptake was measured and compared with correspondent untreated cells. As shown in Fig. 1a, glyburide treatment resulted in an increase in Tf endocytosis in three independent control fibroblast cell lines, ranging from 30 to 50%. This strongly suggested that ABCA1 is indeed involved in membrane trafficking. We then tested glyburide on three Tangier fibroblast cell lines. The inhibition of ABCA1 by glyburide, as expected, had no detectable effect on all the Tangier fibroblasts tested (Fig.1b). Because Tangier fibroblasts express only nonfunctional ABCA1, we then used these Tangier cells to study in detail the effect of impaired ABCA1 function on endocytosis. We then compared receptor-mediated endocytosis in control and Tangier fibroblasts. Tf and LDL are known to bind to surface receptors and to be internalized through clathrin-coated pits (22Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were incubated with Cy3-Tf for 10 min at 37 °C before microscopy observation. A typical Tf intracellular distribution in control fibroblasts is shown in Fig.2a (left). Tf is seen in punctate endosome structures throughout the cells. There were also bright perinuclear clusters in most of the cells, presumably the recycling endosomes. Tf uptake in two Tangier fibroblasts (TD1 and TD2) evidently is greater compared with the two normal (N1 and N2) cell lines. This was verified by quantitative measurements in three Tangier fibroblasts and three normal controls as shown in Fig. 2b. There is an ∼50% increase of Tf endocytosis during a 10-min incubation in Tangier cells in comparison with controls. Increased endocytosis of Tf is not caused by an altered surface receptor expression, because Tf surface binding was similar in all six cell lines (Fig. 2b, light gray bar). We next measured LDL uptake in these cells. Both control and Tangier fibroblasts were incubated with DiI-LDL for 30 min at 37 °C and then fixed for microscopy measurements. Typical DiI-LDL distribution is shown in Fig. 3a. To correct for possible differences in surface receptor expression, LDL surface binding was first measured by incubating cells with DiI-LDL on ice for 30 min (Fig. 3b, black bars). This was used to normalize final DiI-LDL uptake in each cell line (Fig. 3b). Similar to Tf, DiI-LDL uptake in all three Tangier cell lines is more than double that of control cells after a 30-min incubation. Together with Tf uptake results, we conclude that the receptor-mediated endocytosis is up-regulated in Tangier cells including both immortalized and primary Tangier fibroblasts. In addition to receptor-mediated endocytosis, extracellular nutrients can also be taken up by cells through other mechanisms such as pinocytosis (23Ellis S. Mellor H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 85-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A fluid-phase marker, fluorescein-dextran, was used to measure overall endocytosis. The cells were incubated with dextran for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of uptake was quantified. The two Tangier cell lines accumulated more than double the amount of dextran during a 30-min period as compared with normal control cells (Fig. 4). Another method to examine endocytosis is to monitor membrane lipid flow. A short chain sphingomyelin fluorescence analog (BODIPY-C5-SM) was used to assay membrane endocytosis (24Koval M. Pagano R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1082: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated on ice with liposomes containing BODIPY-C5-SM to allow the sphingomyelin analog to insert into the cell surface. The cells then were rinsed with dye-free medium and chased at 37 °C for 10 or 30 min to allow endocytosis to occur. By this time, a population of endosomes containing BODIPY-C5-SM became visible (Fig.5a). The majority of the labeling was still on the cell surface, and the overall degree of labeling was similar in Tangier and control cells. The cells were then cooled down on ice once again, and the remaining surface BODIPY-C5-SM was removed by back exchange with fatty acid-free BSA. The only BODIPY-C5-SM remaining with cells at this point was within the endosomes. Intracellular BODIPY-C5-SM was then quantified as shown in Fig.5b. BODIPY-C5-SM endocytosis was more than doubled in Tangier fibroblasts in comparison with normal controls at both 10 and 30 min. This is again in agreement with results described earlier. Membrane recycling was measured with a fluorescence lipophilic dye, FM 1-43. This dye partitions between membrane and aqueous phase and is fluorescent only in the membrane (a 105 increase in quantum yield) (25Betz W.J. Mao F. Smith C.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with FM 1-43 for 15 min at 37 °C to label endosomal compartments. The cells then were rinsed several times with medium to wash off the dye on the cell surface. The only dye left associated with cells at this time was in the endosomal compartments. The cells were then chased in a dye-free medium. During the chase, lipids in the endosomal compartments move back to the cell surface (membrane recycling), and FM 1-43 loses its fluorescence upon reaching the surface by rapidly dissociating from membrane. The rate of cell-associated fluorescence decay, therefore, is an indicator of membrane exocytosis (26Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). When this experiment was performed with control cells, membrane lipids recycle back to the cell surface witht 12 ∼ 9 min (Fig.6), similar to the rate observed by others (26Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In Tangier cells, however, the fluorescence decay is faster with t 12 ∼ 5 min. This indicates that the membrane flow from endosomal compartments back to the cell surface is accelerated in Tangier fibroblasts. Together with our observations with BODIPY-C5-SM described above, we conclude that the rate of membrane recycling in Tangier cells is about twice that of normal control fibroblasts. ABCA1 has shown to be a PS translocase that transports PS from the internal leaflet to the exofacial leaflet of the membrane. The loss of functional ABCA1, such as in Tangier fibroblasts, could lead to an alteration of PS distribution across the bilayers of the plasma membrane. PS distribution between bilayers is thought to be maintained minimally by two flippases (27Devaux P.F. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); an aminophospholipid flippase flops PS inward, and ABCA1 flips outward. At steady state, most PS is on the internal leaflet of the plasma membrane with a small fraction in the exofacial leaflet. With impaired ABCA1 function and a normal aminophospholipid flippase, however, Tangier fibroblasts may have less PS in the exofacial leaflet. This might be expected to have an impact on membrane bending, which consequently could influence endocytosis. To verify that Tangier cells indeed have an altered PS distribution, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated annexin V was used to quantitate the amount of PS in the outer leaflets. Annexin V is known to have a high affinity for PS and is widely used to detect apoptotic cells where the membrane asymmetry is lost (50van Engeland M. Nieland L.J. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Alexa 488 annexin V surface binding (1 h at 0 °C) was extremely low in fibroblasts, and we failed to detect any significant signal by fluorescent microscopy, indicating a predominant inner leaflet PS distribution in nonapoptotic cells. When we, however, measured annexin V binding by fluorospectrometer using lysates from a large number of cells, we consistently could detect decreased annexin V binding in Tangier fibroblasts (Fig. 7). This supports the notion that PS transmembrane distribution is indeed defective in the presence of ABCA1 mutations. To determine whether enhanced endocytosis in Tangier cells is caused by an alteration in PS distribution, we used a lyso-PS that shares the same head group as PS but lacks one of the fatty acid chains. Lyso-PS, unlike PS, is not the substrate of aminophospholipid flippase (28Farge E. Ojcius D.M. Subtil A. Dautry-Varsat A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C725-C733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enabled us to specifically supplement PS to the exofacial leaflet and possibly to “restore” Tangier cells to “normal” to some extent. Both immortalized and primary Tangier as well as normal fibroblasts were preincubated with lyso-PS (10 µm) for 20 min and then incubated with Tf in the presence of lyso-PS for 10 min at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 8, Tf endocytosis was decreased by 30% in the two Tangier fibroblast cell lines treated with lyso-PS, whereas lyso-PS at this concentration had no significant effect on normal cells. The number of Tf receptors on the cell surface was not altered significantly by lyso-PS treatment (data not shown). This suggests that enhanced endocytosis in Tangier cells could be the direct consequence of an alteration in PS distribution caused by the loss of functional ABCA1. The studies presented here demonstrate that the loss of ABCA1 function in Tangier fibroblasts is associated with enhanced endocytosis. Although the three Tangier cell lines employed here have different mutations in ABCA1, all share a common phenotype: the total absence of apo-AI-mediated lipid efflux (17Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Lymp J. Kavanagh T.J. Halbert C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1769-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Haidar B. Mott S. Boucher B. Lee C.Y. Marcil M. Genest J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 249-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was also observed in cells lacking ABCA1 or its equivalent such as in the ABCA1−/− mouse (9McNeish J. Aiello R.J. Guyot D. Turi T. Gabel C. Aldinger C. Hoppe K.L. Roach M.L. Royer L.J. de Wet J. Broccardo C. Chimini G. Francone O.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4245-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 14Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of ABCA1 correlates with an increase in apo-AI-mediated lipid efflux (12Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 30Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). All these data strongly support an absence of functional ABCA1 in Tangier cell lines. We therefore used Tangier cells to probe the role of this transporter in endocytosis. Using three primary or immortalized Tangier cell lines, we obtained several lines of evidence indicating that ABCA1 plays a role in membrane trafficking. First, we demonstrated that receptor-mediated endocytosis, specifically the uptake of Tf and LDL, was increased significantly in Tangier fibroblasts. We observed similar increases of fluid-phase uptake and endosomal membrane recycling in Tangier cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that the Tangier phenotype of enhanced endocytosis could be reproduced in normal control fibroblasts by a specific ABCA1 inhibitor, glyburide (31Becq F. Hamon Y. Bajetto A. Gola M. Verrier B. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2695-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As anticipated, this inhibitor had no effect on endocytosis in the three Tangier fibroblasts. Interestingly, glyburide has also been shown to have a potent inhibitory effect on cholesterol and lipid efflux in normal cells, reproducing what is observed in Tangier cells (32Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These data support our conclusion that the loss of functional ABCA1 in Tangier cells is indeed responsible for the observed alteration in endocytosis. It is not entirely clear at present how ABCA1 might regulate endocytosis. Signaling processes such as activation of phospholipases D and C were shown to be partially impaired in Tangier cells (33Walter M. Reinecke H. Gerdes U. Nofer J.R. Hobbel G. Seedorf U. Assmann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2315-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This could have an impact on membrane trafficking. Activation of phospholipase D or C, however, was shown to increase endocytosis (34Shen Y. Xu L. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,35Neckers L.M. Vidal C. McGlennen R. Colamonici O. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 166: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It is therefore unlikely that the defects in the phospholipase D or C signaling pathway could explain our observations of enhanced endocytosis in Tangier cells. Alternatively, as suggested by the “rescue effect” of lyso-PS in Tangier fibroblasts, ABCA1 is necessary for the maintenance of cross-leaflet PS distribution of the plasma membrane. Lipids in the plasma membrane are distributed asymmetrically (36Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), with phosphatidylcholine and SM mainly in the exofacial leaflet and phosphatidylethanolamine and PS in the internal leaflet of the membrane. This asymmetry is maintained actively by flippases and translocases that utilize ATP (37Pomorski T. Hrafnsdottir S. Devaux P.F. Meer G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Such a system provides cells with a stable yet highly responsive and dynamic membrane. Within a lipid bilayer, for example, any unidirectional lipid flipping or flopping between two leaflets would cause an alteration of relative surface area of the leaflets and therefore a change in membrane curvature (27Devaux P.F. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This would facilitate either inward (invagination) or outward membrane bending (evagination) (38Sackmann E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Membrane bending then initiates vesiculation leading to either endocytosis or blebbing. Although some invaginations on the cell surface are assisted by protein coatings such as clathrin-coated pits or caveolae, a large number of vesiculation events occur without apparent coating. This is evident by the fact that fluid-phase uptake, a measure of overall vesiculation events, is rather insensitive to the inhibition of clathrin-coated pit endocytosis (39Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This implies that vesiculation events could occur simply by the modifications of membrane leaflets, possibly through a dynamic adjustment of relative surface areas in a lipid bilayer. Hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (an exofacial leaflet lipid on the plasma membrane), for example, results in extensive vesiculations in the absence of visible coatings and is independent of ATP (40Zha X. Pierini L.M. Leopold P.L. Skiba P.J. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This has been attributed to a decrease of surface area in the exofacial leaflet of the membrane, which in turn forces inward membrane bending (40Zha X. Pierini L.M. Leopold P.L. Skiba P.J. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similarly, enrichment of the internal leaflet with exogenous PS is known to produce an increase in endocytosis (41Rauch C. Farge E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 3036-3047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that was dose-dependent and relying on PS being translocated into the internal leaflet of the plasma membrane by an aminophospholipid flippase (42Farge E. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2501-2506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A lyso-PS, similar to the one employed in our study, had an inhibitory effect on endocytosis by remaining on the exofacial leaflet of the membrane (28Farge E. Ojcius D.M. Subtil A. Dautry-Varsat A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C725-C733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, both receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis was affected in this case, similar to our observations. When lyso-PS was added in a concentration that did not have any significant impact on the endocytosis of cells that have functional ABCA1, we found that endocytosis in Tangier cells was attenuated significantly. We cannot rule out the possibility that Tangier cells may have other metabolic defects causing enhanced endocytosis. The facts that Tangier cells have less PS on exofacial leaflet of the membrane and lyso-PS can differentially affect Tangier and normal cells, however, point to the importance of PS in Tangier phenotypes including endocytosis. If indeed ABCA1 functions as PS flippase, it would be responsible for supplying extra PS to the exofacial leaflet of the membrane while depleting PS from internal leaflet. Both these movements favor an outward membrane bending (43Sheetz M.P. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). This in fact is consistent with the observation that ABCA1 or its homologue is required for the engulfment of apoptotic cells (31Becq F. Hamon Y. Bajetto A. Gola M. Verrier B. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2695-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 44Marguet D. Luciani M.F. Moynault A. Williamson P. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a process characterized by membrane protrusion initiated by an outward membrane bending (45Chimini G. Chavrier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E191-E196Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A loss of functional ABCA1 would lead to relatively more PS in the inner leaflet of the membrane. This relative excess inner leaflet area not only suppresses membrane protrusion (engulfment), but also favors membrane inward bending, which in turn facilitates endocytosis. Our interpretation is also in line with the recent finding that another ABC transporter, Drs2p, influences the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles from the trans-Golgi network in yeast (46Chen C.Y. Ingram M.F. Rosal P.H. Graham T.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1223-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This ABC transporter was shown to be an aminophospholipid flippase (47Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) that translocates PS or phosphatidylethanolamine from luminal leaflet to cytoplasmic leaflet on the trans-Golgi network. This may imply that although the budding of clathrin-coated vesicles depends on protein coats, changes in membrane bending energy caused by defects in lipid flippase (Drs2P) or translocase (ABCA1) could add an additional driving force to inhibit or promote initial invagination. The most striking phenotype of Tangier disease is the total absence of lipid efflux from these cells. Recently, a retroendocytosis model has been proposed as a possible mechanism for lipid efflux (16Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Lipid acceptors, either apo-AI or high density lipoprotein, may constantly traffic through endosomes and then recycle back to the cell surface. Possibly within endosomal organelles, the acceptors acquire lipids. Tangier fibroblasts have an enhanced endocytosis yet totally lack lipid efflux. This apparent paradox may be resolved by the fact that the binding of apo-AI is correlated positively with the expression of a functional ABCA1 (12Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 13Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Without functional ABCA1, Tangier cells would not be able to bind to apo-AI efficiently or to shed lipid. Apo-AI cell association and binding in these fibroblasts is extremely low, and in these studies we failed to detect any significant binding or association (data not shown). An outstanding question regarding ABCA1 is how a PS translocase activity possibly facilitates lipid efflux. Using cell lines with or without ABCA1 expression, Fielding et al. (32Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that to acquire cholesterol apo-AI must first be lipidated with phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine. Lipidated apo-AI can then efficiently acquire cholesterol independent of ABCA1 expression. This is in line with recent evidence that ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux does not depend on “rafts,” a membrane microdomain rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin but depleted in phosphatidylcholine (48Mendez A.J. Lin G. Wade D.P. Lawn R.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3158-3166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It seems unlikely that PS can interact with cholesterol directly. In contrast, the relationship between PS and phosphatidylcholine may be important and remains to be explored. In summary, we report that ABCA1 plays an important role in endosomal membrane trafficking. These data support recent studies indicating that ABCA1 functions as a PS translocase (14Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and are in line with reports that ABCA1-green fluorescent protein is mainly localized to the plasma membrane (14Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat.

The most well characterized substrate of MRP1 is the cysteinyl leukotriene, leukotriene C4 (LTC4). Studies with mrp1−/− mice have confirmed that LTC4 is an endogenous substrate for mrp1. These studies have shown that lack of the protein results in an impaired LTC4-mediated inflammatory response and that mrp1-mediated efflux of LTC4 is involved in regulating dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes (15Wijnholds J. Evers R. van Leusden M.R. Mol C.A. Zaman G.J. Mayer U. Beijnen J.H. van, d. V Krimpenfort P. Borst P. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 16Robbiani D.F.

To date, LTC4 remains the highest affinity MRP1/mrp1 substrate that has been identified (Km ∼ 100 nm), and many MRP1 structure-function studies have been based on LTC4transport activity. Examples include reconstitution of LTC4transport activity by heterologous co-expression of the NH2- and COOH-proximal halves of MRP1 (17Gao M. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Topology studies of MRP1 have revealed that MRP1 and P-gp share a similar core structure consisting of two membrane-spanning domains (MSD2 and MSD3) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) (21Hipfner D.R. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The primary distinguishing characteristic of MRP1 and its related proteins, MRPs 2, 3, 6, and 7, is an additional NH2-terminal region forming a membrane-spanning domain (MSD1) with five transmembrane helices (1Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar, 21Hipfner D.R.

Cancer Lett. 2001; 162: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This region is linked to the remainder of the protein by a relatively large cytoplasmic loop (CL), designated CL3, of ∼130 amino acids (21Hipfner D.R. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that deletion of MSD1 plus ∼35 or 95 amino acids of the CL3 eliminates LTC4 transport activity (18Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10733-10740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, transport activity could be restored to both NH2-terminally truncated proteins by co-expressing a fragment that contains MSD1 and the first 95 amino acids of CL3, but not by a fragment containing MSD1 and only the first 35 amino acids of CL3 (18Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10733-10740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similarly, an internal deletion of 53 amino acids within CL3 also inactivates the protein. These studies strongly suggest that the physical integrity of a certain portion of CL3 is essential for LTC4 transport. A similar conclusion was reached by Bakoset al. (19Bakos E. Evers R. Szakacs G. Tusnady G.E. Welker E. Szabo K. de Haas M. van Deemter L. Borst P. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32167-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that a truncated protein lacking MSD1 but retaining essentially all of predicted CL3, MRP1204–1531, retained considerable LTC4transport activity (19Bakos E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32167-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of such a truncated protein is very close to that predicted for a common four-domain ancestor of the MRPs and the more distantly related cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, suggesting that MRP-related proteins with an additional MSD may have evolved by fusion of a gene encoding an already functional transporter with a gene or genes encoding other integral membrane proteins (24Grant C.E. Kurz E.U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Genomics. 1997; 45: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have defined several regions of MRP1 that are required for LTC4 transport (18Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4451-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is presently not known whether these regions are essential for initial binding of substrate, or are required for some subsequent step in the transport process. To define regions of MRP1 involved in LTC4binding, we took advantage of single and dual baculovirus expression vectors, either to produce truncated forms of MRP1 in Sf21 cells, or to co-express two/three fragments of the protein, which were then photolabeled by [3H]LTC4. Using this approach, we have shown that: (i) cooperativity between the NH2- and COOH-proximal halves of MRP1 is required for high affinity LTC4 binding, (ii) LTC4 photoaffinity labels sites in both the NH2- and COOH-proximal halves of the protein, (iii) all or part of the region of CL3 between amino acids 204 and 281 is essential for LTC4 binding, although it is not a site of photoaffinity labeling, (iv) the affinity of LTC4 binding to the region containing MSD2 and NBD1 is selectively decreased when Vi-ADP is trapped at NBD2, and (v) the decrease in LTC4 binding observed under vanadate trapping conditions occurs in the absence of ATP hydrolysis by NBD1. [14,15-3H]LTC4 (38 Ci mmol−1) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and fluorographic reagent Amplify® from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Nucleotides, GSH, andS-methyl GSH were purchased from Sigma. GammaBind Plus Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant donor plasmids encoding the full-length MRP1 and either of the NH2-proximal half-molecule and the COOH-proximal half-molecule of MRP1 have been described (17Gao M. Loe D.W. Grant C.E.

To introduce cDNA fragments encoding truncated half-molecules of MRP1 into pFASTBAC Dual vectors, the same strategy as described for generation of a construct capable of expressing both halves of the protein (25Gao M.

The previously described pFB-ΔN(MRP932–1531), pFB-MRP900–1143, pFB-MRP1138–1531, and pFB-MRP1061–1531 were individually linearized with SalI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and then digested with KpnI. The recovered SalI*-KpnI fragments were ligated to pFASTBAC Dual, which had been digested with SmaI andKpnI to give pFBDual-MRP932–1531, pFBDual-MRP900–1143, pFBDual-MRP1138–1531, and pFBDual-MRP1061–1531. These constructs were further digested with SalI and XbaI and ligated to the SalI-XbaI fragments that were isolated from pFB-MRP1–932, pFB-MRP1–1097, and pFB-MRP1–1138 to generate pFBDual-MRP1–932/MRP900–1143, pFBDual-MRP1–932/MRP1138–1531, pFBDual-MRP1–1097/MRP1061–1531, and pFBDual-MRP1–1138/MRP1138–1531. The dual expression vector carrying cDNA fragments encoding the amino acids 204–653 and 932–1531 of MRP1 (pFBDual-MRP204–653/MRP932–1531) was constructed by one-step deletion; pFBDual-MRP204–932/MRP932–1531 was digested withEcoNI and XbaI, made blunt-ended using Klenow fragment, and then ligated after removal of the deleted fragment. Construct pBSMRP-fc-ATG, which was described previously (17Gao M. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

TheSacI-BamHI* fragment was ligated to pFBDual vector that had a blunted end of HindIII* site and a cohesive end of SacI site to produce pFBDual MRP1–281. Translation of the inserted fragment terminated at a stop codon in the vector, resulting in the addition of six amino acids, QLVEKY. pFBDual MRP1–281 was linearized with SmaI and KpnI and ligated to the SalI*-KpnI fragment isolated from pFB-MRP281–1531 to produce pFBDual MRP1–281/MRP281–1531. Constructs of pFB-MRPΔ(228–280) and pFB-MRP281–1531, which were described previously (18Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

These fragments were ligated to pFBDual-MRP1–932/MRP932–1531 that had been linearized with the same restriction enzymes to produce pFBDual-MRP1–932(Δ228–280)/MRP932–1531 and pFBDual-MRP281–932/MRP932–1531. Generation of recombinant bacmids and baculoviruses and conditions used for viral infection were described previously (17Gao M. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Membrane vesicles were prepared by nitrogen cavitation and sucrose gradient centrifugation, as described (6Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol.

Membrane vesicle proteins were electrophoresed on 5–15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with mAbs QCRL-1, MRPr1, or MRPm6, which we have demonstrated recognize the NH2-proximal part of the protease-sensitive region connecting NBD1 to MSD3 (amino acids 918–924), CL3 (amino acids 228–237), and the COOH terminus of MRP1 (amino acids 1511–1520), respectively (26Hipfner D.R.

LTC4 transport was assayed in membrane vesicles at 23 °C in the presence of 4 mm ATP or AMP using a rapid filtration technique, as described previously (6Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Insect cell membrane vesicles (75 µg of protein in 35 µl) were incubated with [3H]LTC4 (0.25 µCi, 200 nm) at room temperature for 10 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and UV-irradiated, as described (10Qian Y.M. Song W.C. Cui H. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6404-6411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled vesicles were analyzed on a 5–15% (or as indicated) gel by SDS-PAGE prior to fluorography. [3H]LTC4 photolabeling of tryptic fragments of native MRP1 in cell membranes from the multidrug-resistant small cell lung cancer cell line, H69AR, was also performed as above after membrane vesicles (120 µg of protein) were treated with trypsin at various trypsin/protein ratios (1:800–1:25) (22Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiments, LTC4 labeling was carried out using 150 µg of membrane proteins and 0.5 µCi of [3H]LTC4. After UV irradiation, membrane proteins were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% CHAPS at 4 °C for 3 h and insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation. mAbs QCRL-1 and MRPm6 (1 µg each) were then added to the supernatant of solubilized membrane proteins and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Antibody-associated proteins were absorbed with GammaBind Plus Sepharose for 1 h, and the beads were washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Immunocomplexes were then solubilized and analyzed as above. Initially, membrane vesicles from Sf21 insect cells expressing intact MRP1 were examined to establish that the protein could be specifically and efficiently photolabeled with [3H]LTC4, as we and others have shown previously using MRP1-enriched membrane vesicles from mammalian cells (6Loe D.W.

A prominently labeled 170-kDa protein, consistent with the size predicted for core glycosylated MRP1 (1Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U.

No comparable labeling was observed in membranes prepared from control cells infected with baculovirus encoding β-glucuronidase. In addition, unlabeled LTC4 (6 µm) abolished [3H]LTC4 labeling of the 170-kDa protein confirming the specificity of the binding (Fig.2B). Previously, we have demonstrated that LTC4 selectively stimulates ATP binding by NBD1 of MRP1, but the influence of nucleotide on LTC4binding has not been determined (25Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Consequently, photoaffinity cross-linking with [3H]LTC4 was performed using previously established ATP binding conditions in the absence and presence of 4 mm ATPγS, a poorly-hydrolyzable ATP analog. No effect of the nucleotide analog on LTC4 binding was observed (Fig. 2C). MRP1 fragments comprising 1–932 and 932–1531 have been shown previously to be capable of associating to form a functional transporter (see Fig. 1 for predicted secondary structure of MRP1 and illustration of various MRP1 constructs) (17Gao M. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27782-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To examine LTC4 binding by these fragments, cells were infected with either a dual expression vector encoding both MRP11–932and MRP1932–1531 or with vectors encoding one or the other fragment. Membrane vesicles were then prepared from the infected cells and immunoblotted with mAbs QCRL-1 and MRPm6 to detect the NH2- and COOH-halves of the protein, respectively (Fig.3A). When membrane vesicles prepared from cells infected with the dual expression vector were photolabeled with [3H]LTC4, strong labeling of a protein corresponding in size to the NH2-proximal fragment and weaker but readily detectable labeling of a protein with the predicted size of the COOH-proximal fragment was observed (Fig. 3B). Confirmation of the identities of the proteins labeled with LTC4 in cells co-expressing both halves of the protein was obtained by immunoprecipitation with a combination of two mAbs, QCRL-1 and MRPm6, recognizing the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of MRP1, respectively (Fig. 3C). To investigate whether labeling of both half molecules was the consequence of autonomous binding by independent sites in each half of the protein, we examined membranes from cells expressing comparable levels of one or the other fragment. Although much reduced in intensity, weak photolabeling of the NH2-terminal half of the protein could be detected in the absence of the COOH-terminal fragment (Fig. 3B). Labeling of the COOH-terminal half was also markedly decreased. However, because of the presence of endogenous proteins with similar electrophoretic mobility to this fragment that were very weakly labeled with [3H]LTC4, we were unable to definitively determine whether or not a very low level of binding to the COOH-terminal half of the protein may also occur. Overall, these data demonstrate that high affinity binding of LTC4 requires association of both halves of the protein and that the NH2-proximal half alone may be capable of binding LTC4 but with much lower affinity than the complete protein. Co-expression of other combinations of fragments that fail to form a functional transporter, in some cases, displayed labeling on one or two fragments. However, when compared with the results obtained with the full-length protein or by co-expressing fragments MRP11–932 with MRP1932–1531, the intensity of labeling was in general much reduced (summarized in TableI or shown in Fig. 3D).Table ISummary of [3H]LTC4 labeling of membrane vesicles co-expressing two or three fragments of MRP1Protein[3H]LTC4labelingLTC4 transport activityNH2-fragmentCOOH-fragment%MRP11–932/932–1531+++++++++100MRP1281–932/932–1531+++0–10MRP1281–932/932–15311-aThese two fragments were co-expressed with MRP11–281.++++++++60–70MRP1204–563/932–1531+/−+++0–10MRP1932–1531−+0MRP11–932/900–1143++/−0–10MRP11–932/1138–1531+++/−0–10MRP11–932+−0MRP11–281/281–1531−+++++70–80MRP11–1097/1061–1531++++0–10MRP11–1138/1138–1531+−0–101-a These two fragments were co-expressed with MRP11–281. Open table in a new tab To confirm that sites in the NH2- and COOH-proximal halves of the intact MRP1 expressed in mammalian cells were also labeled with LTC4, photolabeling experiments were carried out with membranes prepared from drug resistant H69AR lung cancer cells from which MRP1 was originally cloned (1Cole S.P.C.

We have shown that MRP1 constitutes up to 5% of membrane proteins in these cells (29Mao Q. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Biochim. Biophys.

When H69AR membranes were subjected to mild trypsinolysis and [3H]LTC4 cross-linking followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography, two fragments of 75–80 and 55–60 kDa were labeled (Fig. 4). Immunoblotting using MRP1-specific antibodies with known epitopes indicated that these two fragments corresponded to regions between approximately amino acids 900–1531 (MSD3 and NBD2) and 250–900 (MSD2 and NBD1), the fragment with the larger apparent Mr resulting from glycosylation at position 1006 in MSD3 (Ref. 22Hipfner D.R.

These results are consistent with the experiments using recombinant MRP1 expressed in insect cells as shown above.

In this report, we demonstrate that Vezf1/DB1 is a nuclear localizing protein that potently and specifically activates transcription mediated by the human endothelin-1 promoter, in a Tax-independent manner, in transient transfection assays. Using a combination of deletion mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, a novel Vezf1/DB1-responsive element was localized to a 6-base pair (bp) motif, ACCCCC, located 47 bp upstream of the endothelin-1 transcription start site. Recombinant Vezf1/DB1 also bound to this sequence, and a 2-bp mutation in this element abolished Vezf1/DB1 responsiveness by the endothelin-1 promoter. Vezf1/DB1 could be identified with a specific antibody in nuclear complexes from endothelial cells that bound to this element. Regulation of endothelin-1 promoter activity by Vezf1/DB1 provides a mechanism for endothelin-1 expression in the vascular endothelium during development and to maintain vascular tone; Vezf1/DB1 itself is a candidate transcription factor for modifying endothelial cell phenotypes in order to appropriately assemble and maintain the cardiovascular system.

Recombinant Vezf1/DB1 also bound to this sequence, and a 2-bp mutation in this element abolished Vezf1/DB1 responsiveness by the endothelin-1 promoter. Vezf1/DB1 could be identified with a specific antibody in nuclear complexes from endothelial cells that bound to this element. Regulation of endothelin-1 promoter activity by Vezf1/DB1 provides a mechanism for endothelin-1 expression in the vascular endothelium during development and to maintain vascular tone; Vezf1/DB1 itself is a candidate transcription factor for modifying endothelial cell phenotypes in order to appropriately assemble and maintain the cardiovascular system. endothelin-1 vascular endothelial zinc finger 1 activator protein 1 hypoxia inducible factor 1 human endothelin-1 myocardial endothelial cells glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein cytomegalovirus base pair(s) electrophoretic mobility shift assay The endothelium maintains vascular integrity during adulthood by regulating vascular tone, lymphocyte trafficking, vessel growth, and hemostasis (1Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In particular, the vascular endothelium modulates vascular tone and blood pressure through the coordinated production of potent vasoactive molecules. In addition, the endothelium directs formation of the vascular system during development through its role in the processes of vasculogenesis (development of blood vessels from angioblasts in situ) andangiogenesis (sprouting of new vessels from existing vessels) (2Risau W. Flamme I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 73-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Whereas endothelial mechanisms during development and in adulthood may seem discrete, there is now strong evidence that they overlap considerably, and that molecules required for normal vascular development may contribute to vascular homeostasis in adulthood, and vice versa.Endothelin-1 (ET-1),1 a 21-amino acid peptide originally isolated from porcine endothelial cells (3Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10185) Google Scholar), provides one example of an endothelial cell protein that is critical both for cardiovascular development in the embryo and for vascular homeostasis in the adult. ET-1, which is expressed primarily in endothelial cells and also epithelial cells of the branchial arches during development (4Thomas T. Kurihara H. Yamagishi H. Kurihara Y. Yazaki Y. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Development. 1998; 125: 3005-3014PubMed Google Scholar), is required for the development of neural crest-derived tissues arising from the branchial arches, such as the great vessels, the ventricular septum, and craniofacial structures (5Kurihara Y. Kurihara H. Oda H. Maemura K. Nagai R. Ishikawa T. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These effects seem to be mediated via interactions with the endothelin-A receptor, which is expressed in neural crest cells. Loss of ET-1 signaling leads to apoptosis of post-migratory neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells, with resultant cardiovascular defects such as ventricular septal defects, truncus arteriosus, and interruption of the aortic arch.In addition to its function as a critical developmental signal for the cardiovascular system, ET-1 has potent and complex effects on the adult vasculature. ET-1 has direct vasoconstrictor effects on vascular smooth muscle cells, and sensitizes smooth muscle cells to the effects of angiotensin II and norepinephrine (6Miller W.L. Redfield M.M. Burnett J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). ET-1 also stimulates the release of aldosterone and nitric oxide, the latter effect indicating that the vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1 may be most pronounced when endothelial function is compromised. The effects of ET-1 are linked pathophysiologically to the development of hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy (7Ito H. Hirata Y. Hiroe M. Tsujino M. Adachi S. Takamoto T. Nitta M. Taniguchi K. Marumo F. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and ischemic heart disease (8Serneri G.G. Cecioni I. Vanni S. Paniccia R. Bandinelli B. Vetere A. Janming X. Bertolozzi I. Boddi M. Lisi G.F. Sani G. Modesti P.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 377-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Given the bifunctional role of ET-1 in development and in vascular homeostasis, it is not surprising that its expression and activity are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. The humanET-1 gene has a TATA box-containing promoter, and severalcis-acting elements have been implicated in transcriptional regulation of ET-1 mRNA. An upstream activator protein-1 (AP-1) site located at position −117, which is bound by c-fos and c-jun, is required for inducible high-level ET-1 promoter activity (9Lee M.E. Dhadly M.S. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Yoshizumi M. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19034-19039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a GATA motif at position −135, which is bound by the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-2 in endothelial cells (10Lee M.E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16188-16192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is crucial to the basal and regulated expression of the ET-1 gene. Furthermore, the cooperativity between the AP-1 complex and GATA-2 leads to a synergistic increase in trans-activation ofET-1 (11Kawana M. Lee M. Quertermous E. Quertermous T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 42256-44231Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Last, hypoxia-mediated expression of ET-1 is mediated via trans-activation of the ET-1promoter by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (12Yamashita K. Discher D.J. Hu J. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, the expression of fos/jun and GATA-2 is not restricted to endothelial cells, and the up-regulation of theET-1 gene via the GATA motif is not limited to GATA-2, as other members of the GATA family, such as GATA-1 and GATA-3, exert a similar effect (11Kawana M. Lee M. Quertermous E. Quertermous T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 42256-44231Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Because GATA-2, HIF-1, and the Fos and Jun family members are expressed more promiscuously than is ET-1, the action of these factors alone cannot be responsible for the cell type-restricted activation of the ET-1 gene. Therefore, it is possible that the binding of the trans-acting factors to these sites may recruit or otherwise cooperate with additional proteins which are important for cell restricted expression of theET-1 gene. In any event, a 6-kilobase fragment of the mouse ET-1 promoter confers vascular-specific expression in transgenic mice (13Harats D. Kurihara H. Belloni P. Oakley H. Ziober A. Ackley D. Cain G. Kurihara Y. Lawn R. Sigal E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1335-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Vezf1/DB1 is a recently identified endothelial cell-specific protein. A retroviral trap screen identified a 56-kDa protein expressed specifically in the vascular endothelium, vascular endothelial zinc finger 1 (Vezf1) (14Xiong J.W. Leahy A. Lee H.H. Stuhlmann H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Vezf1, which is the mouse homologue of a previously identified but incompletely characterized human protein called DB1 (15Koyano-Nakagawa N. Nishida J. Baldwin D. Arai K. Yokota T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), is a putative transcription factor that contains 6 Cys2/His2-type zinc finger motifs, as well as a glutamine-stretch and a proline-rich region characteristic of transcriptional activation or repression domains. Vezf1/DB1 is first expressed in the anterior-most mesoderm at day 7.25 post-conception. Expression remains restricted to the vascular endothelium through at least day 13.5 and is detectable in endothelial cells undergoing both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis (14Xiong J.W. Leahy A. Lee H.H. Stuhlmann H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Vezf1/DB1 is therefore an attractive candidate as a potential transcription factor for mediating endothelial cell-specific gene expression, and is expressed in the correct spatial and temporal sequence during embryogenesis to regulate genes critical for endothelial cell differentiation, cardiovascular development, and/or angiogenesis. In an effort to identify transcriptional targets for Vezf1/DB1 in vascular endothelial cells, we have found that Vezf1/DB1 potently trans-activates the human endothelin-1 (hET-1) promoter, and we have characterized a novel Vezf1/DB1-responsive element in the ET-1 5′-flanking sequence.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we identify Vezf1/DB1 as an endothelial cell-specific transcription factor. We also characterize a logical transcriptional target, and the DNA response element through which this target is chosen. Vezf1/DB1 potently trans-activates the hET-1 5′-flanking sequence through a novel response element, ACCCCC, to mediate high level transcriptional activity of this promoter. Proteins from endothelial cell nuclear extracts bind specifically to this essential response element, and endogenous Vezf1/DB1 exists as a component of this binding activity. These results provide convincing evidence that Vezf1/DB1 acts as a transcription factor and thatET-1 is a transcriptional target for this protein. In addition, these studies provide a rational explanation for inducible expression of ET-1 specifically within the vascular endothelium.Vezf1/DB1 was first identified by screening an expression library with a GC-rich Tax-responsive element within the interleukin-3 promoter (15Koyano-Nakagawa N. Nishida J. Baldwin D. Arai K. Yokota T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recombinant Vezf1/DB1 could bind to this GC-rich sequence by EMSA; however, Vezf1/DB1 by itself was not able totrans-activate the interleukin-3 promoter, although it did modulate Tax-mediated trans-activation in a phorbol ester-dependent fashion. We have similarly seen low-affinity interactions between Vezf1/DB1 and GC-rich regions within the KDR/flk-1 promoter in EMSA experiments, 2J. Aitsebaomo and C. Patterson, unpublished observations. yet Vezf1/DB1 does not trans-activate the KDR/flk-1 promoter (Fig.2A). Therefore, we suspect these low affinity interactions with GC-rich sequences may not be physiologically significant. In contrast, the highly specific interactions identified between Vezf1/DB1 and the ACCCCC motif result in potent trans-activation of the ET-1 promoter. These observations, in conjunction with the overlapping expression pattern of Vezf1/DB1 and ET-1 during development (4Thomas T. Kurihara H. Yamagishi H. Kurihara Y. Yazaki Y. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Development. 1998; 125: 3005-3014PubMed Google Scholar, 14Xiong J.W. Leahy A. Lee H.H. Stuhlmann H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), makes regulation of ET-1 by Vezf1/DB1 a more plausible physiologic interaction to regulate gene expression in vascular endothelial cells. The ACCCCC sequence characterized in these studies as the Vezf1/DB1-binding site and response element does not exactly correspond to any previously identified transcription factor-binding sites, as determined by searches of the TRANSFAC data base. However, it is interesting to note that MAZ, which is closely related to Vezf1/DB1 and also contains 6 highly similar zinc fingers of the Cys2/His2 type, binds to response elements containing stretches of G or C residues (23Her S. Bell R.A. Bloom A.K. Siddall B.J. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8698-8707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), suggesting that this family of transcription factors may have particularly high affinity for homopolymeric stretches of G/C residues. Identification of a defined Vezf1/DB1-binding site will aid in the discovery of other Vezf1/DB1-responsive genes within the vascular endothelium.The studies presented here do not specifically address how Vezf1/DB1 activity itself is regulated, and what the consequences of differences in Vezf1/DB1 activity might mean with respect to ET-1 expression, although some interesting hypotheses can be generated based on our observations and those of others. ET-1 expression in endothelial cells is known to be dependent on Rho GTPase activity, and Rho signaling itself can directly activate the ET-1 promoter (25Hernandez-Perera O. Perez-Sala D. Soria E. Lamas S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This effect may have particular importance with respect to modulating vasoconstrictive, migratory, and proliferative effects of cells that are ET-1-responsive, such as smooth muscle and neural crest cells, especially since Rho signaling pathways down-regulate endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (26Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), which opposes the actions of ET-1 within the vasculature. The relationship between ET-1 expression and Rho signaling is significant because physical interactions have been demonstrated between Vezf1/DB1 and the fraction of prenylated RhoB that is localized to the nucleus (27Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Cell. Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that Vezf1/DB1 serves, at least in part, to mediate Rho-dependent signaling events, such as ET-1 expression, at the transcriptional level in endothelial cells.Although previous data provide few insights into the function of Vezf1/DB1, the expression of this gene during development argues strongly for a specific role in vascular development. The expression of Vezf1/DB1 overlaps significantly during development with KDR/flk-1 (14Xiong J.W. Leahy A. Lee H.H. Stuhlmann H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor and a marker for endothelial cells and their precursors during development in the mouse (28Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.-F. Breitman M. Schuh A. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). This would suggest: 1) that Vezf1/DB1 may lie upstream of KDR/flk-1 by up-regulating its expression; 2) that Vezf1/DB1 is induced in KDR/flk-1-expressing cells; or 3) that KDR/flk-1 and Vezf1/DB1 are regulated in parallel, possibly through similar mechanisms. We have found no evidence for the first possibility, that Vezf1/DB1 regulates expression of KDR/flk-12 (Fig. 2A). Instead, we find that Vezf1/DB1 trans-activates ET-1, which appears later than KDR/flk-1 during vascular development. Deficiency of ET-1 during development results in branchial arch abnormalities, leading to defects in branchial arch artery development and subsequent malformation of the great vessels and cardiac outflow tract abnormalities, as well as characteristic craniofacial abnormalities (4Thomas T. Kurihara H. Yamagishi H. Kurihara Y. Yazaki Y. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Development. 1998; 125: 3005-3014PubMed Google Scholar,5Kurihara Y. Kurihara H. Oda H. Maemura K. Nagai R. Ishikawa T. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). If the effects of Vezf1/DB1 on ET-1 expression observed in the present studies are representative of regulatory events that are critical in endothelial cells during vascular development, then absence of Vezf1/DB1 in mice should phenocopy, at least partially,ET-1-null mice. Experiments to delete Vezf1/DB1 in mice by homologous recombination will determine whether the molecular events described in the present studies are essential for the regulation ofET-1 during development.Although cell type-specific gene regulation is beginning to be understood for many lineages, such as skeletal myocytes (29Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (30Owens G.K. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), there is still little known about the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate cell type-specific gene expression in the vascular endothelium. For example, KDR/flk-1 is a well characterized marker for vascular endothelial cells during development, and studies have demonstrated the importance of a variety of transcription factors in control of its expression, including Sp1 (31Patterson C. Wu Y. Lee M.-E. DeVault J.D. Runge M.S. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8410-8416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), TFII-I (21Wu Y. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and GATA proteins (32Kappel A. Schlaeger T.M. Flamme I. Orkin S.H. Risau W. Breier G. Blood. 2000; 96: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Minami T. Rosenberg R.D. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5395-5402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, none of these proteins by themselves account for the restricted pattern of KDR/flk-1 expression during development. Similarly, GATA-2, AP-1, and HIF-1 have all been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of ET-1 (9Lee M.E. Dhadly M.S. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Yoshizumi M. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19034-19039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lee M.E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), yet the means by which ET-1 expression is induced specifically within the vascular endothelium is still not explained.Several reports have implicated Ets family members in endothelial development and cell type-specific gene regulation (34Brown L.A. Rodaway A.R. Schilling T.F. Jowett T. Ingham P.W. Patient R.K. Sharrocks A.D. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 35Dube A. Akbarali Y. Sato T.N. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); however, most of these proteins are expressed in many lineages other than endothelial cells, so Ets proteins are likely required to cooperate with factors that are expressed in a more restricted fashion to mediate endothelial cell gene regulation. The helix-loop-helix transcription factor SCL/tal-1 has been implicated in endothelium-specific transcriptional events as well. Although SCL/tal-1 is dispensable for endothelial cell specification but required for generation of all hematopoietic lineages (36Robb L. Lyons I. Li R. Hartley L. Kontgen F. Harvey R.P. Metcalf D. Begley C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7075-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 37Shivdasani R.A. Mayer E.L. Orkin S.H.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4123-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), a role in endothelial pattern formation has been attributed to SCL/tal-1 (39Visvader J.E. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These data would suggest that SCL/tal-1 functions to direct endothelial cell gene expression in early stages of development, although this conclusion has been drawn into question by the demonstration that these effects of SCL/tal-1 are DNA-binding independent (40Porcher C. Liao E.C. Fujiwara Y. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H. Development. 1999; 126: 4603-4615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In any event, endothelial transcriptional targets for SCL/tal-1 have not been well characterized, and the prominent role of SCL/tal-1 in hematopoietic transcriptional events indicates that SCL/tal-1 cannot, by itself, explain endothelial cell type-specific gene expression. In contrast, the identification of Vezf1/DB1 as a developmentally regulated, endothelial specific protein (14Xiong J.W. Leahy A. Lee H.H. Stuhlmann H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and our demonstration here that it is a nuclear localizing protein that functions as a transcriptional activator, indicates that Vezf1/DB1 may serve as an important missing link in our understanding of endothelial cell type-specific gene regulation. Although further studies will be necessary to determine the range of endothelial cell genes that are regulated by Vezf1/DB1, and the functional role of this protein in the modulation of endothelial cell phenotypes, our studies support the hypothesis that Vezf1/DB1, in cooperation with other transcription factors yet to be determined, assists in the cellular process of determining the complement of genes that are expressed within the vascular endothelium. The endothelium maintains vascular integrity during adulthood by regulating vascular tone, lymphocyte trafficking, vessel growth, and hemostasis (1Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In particular, the vascular endothelium modulates vascular tone and blood pressure through the coordinated production of potent vasoactive molecules. In addition, the endothelium directs formation of the vascular system during development through its role in the processes of vasculogenesis (development of blood vessels from angioblasts in situ) andangiogenesis (sprouting of new vessels from existing vessels) (2Risau W.

We found BRCA1 associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (holo-pol), a large mass complex called the fraction 5 complex, the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex, and a complex that has not been described previously. We observed this new complex after treating cells with hydroxyurea, suggesting that the hydroxyurea-induced complex (HUIC) is involved with the response to DNA replication blockage. After hydroxyurea treatment of cells, BRCA1 content decreased in the holo-pol and the fraction 5 complex, and BRCA1 was redistributed to the HUIC. The HUIC was shown not to contain a number of holo-pol components or the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex but was associated with the BRCA1-associated RING domain protein BARD1. These data suggest that BRCA1 participates in multiple cellular processes by multiple protein complexes and that the BRCA1 content of these complexes is dynamically altered after DNA replication blockage. The BRCA1 protein is known to participate in multiple cellular processes. In these experiments, we resolved four distinct BRCA1-containing complexes. We found BRCA1 associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (holo-pol), a large mass complex called the fraction 5 complex, the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex, and a complex that has not been described previously. We observed this new complex after treating cells with hydroxyurea, suggesting that the hydroxyurea-induced complex (HUIC) is involved with the response to DNA replication blockage. After hydroxyurea treatment of cells, BRCA1 content decreased in the holo-pol and the fraction 5 complex, and BRCA1 was redistributed to the HUIC. The HUIC was shown not to contain a number of holo-pol components or the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex but was associated with the BRCA1-associated RING domain protein BARD1. These data suggest that BRCA1 participates in multiple cellular processes by multiple protein complexes and that the BRCA1 content of these complexes is dynamically altered after DNA replication blockage. RNA polymerase II RNA polymerase II holoenzyme hydroxyurea hydroxyurea-induced complex immunoprecipitation hemagglutinin Mutations in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene are associated with about 4% of all breast cancers and about 50% of all familial cases (1Venkitaraman A.R.

Emerging data indicate that BRCA1 is likely to serve as an important central component in multiple biological pathways that regulate transcription, repair of DNA damage, the cell cycle, polyadenylation of mRNAs, and chromatin remodeling (3Deng C.X.

It is not clear whether all of these processes are due to one biochemical mechanism or to multiple mechanisms with BRCA1 functioning in multiple protein complexes. BRCA1 has been found to be associated with multiple polypeptides, including BARD1, which binds to the amino terminus of BRCA1 (8Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Both BRCA1 and BARD1 proteins contain a RING finger motif and BRCT repeat. The BRCA1-BARD1 complex interacts with a polyadenylation factor, CstF50 (cleavage stimulation factor), suggesting a link between the regulation of polyadenylation of mRNA and DNA repair (4Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Science. 1999; 285: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). BRCA1 has ubiquitin ligase activity, and, in association with BARD1, ubiquitin ligase activity is high (9Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Several BRCA1-containing complexes have been purified using different methods. BRCA1 involvement in transcription is indicated by its association with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (holo-pol) and by activation of transcription by BRCA1 in cell free reactions (12Schlegel B.P.

BRCA1 is associated with the chromatin-remodeling SWI-SNF (mating type switch/sucrose non-fermenters) complex, either in association with holo-pol (23Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or independent of Pol II (25Bochar D.A. Wang L. Beniya H. Kinev A. Xue Y. Lane W.S. Wang W. Kashanchi F. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2000; 102: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). BRCA1 association with Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 may contribute to repair of DNA damage. The BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex contains various proteins for DNA repair, including the Rad50 complex, cell cycle check point, and DNA replication factors (26Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex is derived from a single-step immunoprecipitation (IP) from unpurified nuclear extracts, it is unclear whether it represents multiple complexes or a single complex. BRCA1 protein dynamically changes its subcellular localization, depending on the cell cycle or whether the genome has been damaged. In S phase, BRCA1 localizes to discrete nuclear foci (27Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), but treatment with hydroxyurea (HU), UV irradiation, or γ-irradiation leads to dispersal of these BRCA1 foci (28Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). After HU and UV treatment, BRCA1 colocalizes with BARD1 and RAD51 in proliferating cell nuclear antigen-containing replication structures (29Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F. Tomlinson G. Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Scully R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 317-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). After HU treatment or irradiation, BRCA1 forms a complex with Rad50, Mre11, and Nbs1 in discrete nuclear foci (irradiation-induced foci) (19Wong A.K. Ormonde P.A. Pero R. Chen Y. Lian L. Salada G.

Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether these changes in subcellular position reflect changes in BRCA1 protein complexes. In this study, we observed BRCA1 associated with three protein complexes in asynchronously cycling cells, and BRCA1 shifted to a fourth protein complex after cells were treated with HU. These data support a concept that the multiple processes with which BRCA1 is involved reflect multiple protein complexes with which it associates. HeLa-S3 cells and 293S cells were passaged in suspension culture using standard procedures. About 5 × 109 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of about 1–2 plaque-forming units/cell, and cells were harvested 44 h after infection. The purification from whole-cell extracts by chromatography on a Biorex70 ion exchange matrix and sucrose gradient sedimentation have been described previously (22Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 23Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). HA epitope-tagged full-length and deleted mutant BRCA1 were inserted into AdEasy (Quantum Biotechnology, Inc.) shuttle vectors such that the BRCA1 gene would be under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Full-length HA epitope-tagged BRCA1 (HA epitope tagged to the amino terminus, HA-BRCA1; HA epitope tagged to the carboxyl terminus, BRCA1-HA) was subcloned from constructs in the pcDNA3 vector (27Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The 775–1292 deletion was constructed by digestion of KpnI and NheI from HA-BRCA1 followed by ligated insertion of the following forward and reverse linkers: forward, 5′-CTGGTGGACCAAAGAAGAAGCGTAAGACCGGTG-3′; and reverse, 5′-CTAGCACCGGTCTTACGCTTCTTCTTTGGTCCACCAGGTAC-3′. This fragment was inserted into the AdEasy shuttle vector. With each shuttle vector construct, recombination occurred in bacteria to recover adenoviral genomic DNA with the BRCA1 gene, and virus was recovered after transfection into 293A cells. 400–500 µl of protein from sucrose gradient fraction or 150–180 µl of eluted protein from the Biorex70 column was immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody for the HA epitope (12CA5), Med17, or Mre11. 450–750 µl of binding reactions was incubated with rotation for 4 h at 4 °C in buffer H (20 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol), 0.12 m KOAc, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in the presence of protein extract, 3–5 µl of antibody, and 20 µl of protein A beads. When affinity-purified anti-Med17 antibody (30Chao D.M. Gadbois E.L. Murray P.J. Anderson S.F. Sonu M.S. Parvin J.D. Young R.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 31Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) was used, these steps were performed with or without antigenic peptide (0.1 mg/ml). With all IPs, supernatant was removed, and protein beads were then washed three times using 450–800 ml of wash buffer (120 or 300 mm KOAc, 20 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.9, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For Western blot analysis, samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 5% or 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted using the indicated antibodies. We have previously identified two separate protein complexes containing BRCA1 in HeLa cell extracts (22Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 23Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). One complex was identified as the holo-pol, and the second complex was a more massive complex, which may have contained a nucleic acid component (23Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A third BRCA1-containing complex has been described that contains Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 along with BRCA1 (20Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) or contains other repair factors (26Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Data have suggested that BRCA1 shifts its subnuclear localization and perhaps associates with new protein complexes after HU-mediated replication block or exposure to DNA-damaging agents in the S phase of the cell cycle (26Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). To induce a replication block in cells in large-scale culture, we treated HeLa-S3 cells with 10 mm HU for 16 h. We reasoned that, regardless of the position of a given cell in the cell cycle, this incubation time was sufficient to drive all cells into S phase, whereupon DNA replication is blocked due to depletion of deoxynucleotide triphosphates. Extracts were then prepared by standard procedures (23Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). When comparing asynchronous cell extracts with HU-treated extracts, we observed an increased abundance of cyclin A relative to cyclin E, suggesting that the HU-treated extract was indeed enriched for S-phase proteins (Fig.1A). Extracts were subjected to ion exchange chromatography using Biorex70 matrix, and comparison to our previously published observations from untreated extracts (23Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) revealed that BRCA1 and Pol II fractionation on this matrix were unchanged by HU treatment. Most of the BRCA1 eluted in the 0.6m KOAc step elution, and a smaller amount of BRCA1 was observed in the 0.3 m KOAc step elution. Most of Pol II was observed in the 0.6 m KOAc elution (Fig.1B). We next fractionated BRCA1 using sucrose gradient sedimentation. Whereas Pol II was observed to sediment at about 30 S in the fractions consistent with the holo-pol in both extracts (+ and −HU), BRCA1 was shifted in its sedimentation pattern. In untreated cell extracts, BRCA1 is observed in two pools of protein, one in fractions 1–3 at the bottom of the gradient (>60 S), and one pool in fractions 11–17 consistent with the holo-pol (Fig. 1C, top). The HU-treated extract resulted in an observed shift in BRCA1 from these two complexes to a third complex with lower mass that we call the HUIC (Fig. 1C). The BRCA1 content in fractions 1–3 was markedly decreased, and the BRCA1 content in fractions 11–15 was also diminished, but a new peak of BRCA1 protein was observed in fractions 17–21. The holoenzyme-specific marker cycC (32Cho H. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11495-11502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) eluted primarily in fractions 9–15, regardless of the exposure of the cells to HU, consistent with those fractions containing the holo-pol (Fig. 1C). It is thus inferred that this third peak seen only after the addition of HU is not associated with the holo-pol. Whereas the observations with the untreated extracts are consistent with previously published observations (22Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 23Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the HUIC has not yet been described. To further characterize the HUIC as well as other BRCA1-containing protein complexes, we established a system for overexpressing epitope-tagged BRCA1 in preparative extracts. Recombinant adenoviruses, which express full-length BRCA1 with an amino-terminal HA tag, were used to infect ∼5 × 109 293S cells in suspension culture. Whole-cell extracts were prepared by standard procedures (23Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and chromatographed on a Biorex70 ion exchange matrix, and protein fractions were eluted in washes of increasing concentrations of potassium acetate (Fig.2A). Immunoblotting of eluted proteins for HA-BRCA1 and Pol II revealed that overexpressed BRCA1 cofractionated in the 0.6 m KOAc elution in a manner similar to that observed with the holo-pol from HeLa cells (Fig.2B; Ref. 22Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This 0.6 m KOAc peak fraction was then subjected to sucrose gradient sedimentation (Fig. 2C). Immunoblotting for HA reveals that HA-BRCA1 has two peaks of protein concentration, in fraction 5 and fractions 13–17. By contrast, Pol II has a broad peak with highest concentrations that correspond to the peak of HA-BRCA1 in fractions 13–17 (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the peak of BRCA1 in fraction 5 is a distinct pool of the protein and is not the holo-pol. Overexpression of BRCA1 did not result in significant aberrant pools of BRCA1 because this pattern of fractionation of BRCA1 is almost identical to that of the endogenous BRCA1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 1; Ref. 23Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The pattern of the overexpressed BRCA1 does result in sharp peaks on the sucrose gradient, and this will be shown to be due in part to the absence of the HUIC when the full-length protein is overexpressed (see below). In addition, overexpression of a similar BRCA1 protein that is HA-tagged on the carboxyl terminus resulted in an identical purification over these two steps (data not shown). To confirm that overexpressed HA-BRCA1 interacts with Pol II, sucrose gradient-purified holo-pol (fraction 14) was epitope-purified using the HA epitope-specific antibody and compared with the equivalent fraction from uninfected 293S cells (Fig. 2D). Pol II was purified in the sample with the overexpressed HA-BRCA1, but only a background level of Pol II was detected in the IP from the uninfected cells. These results showed that overexpressed epitope-tagged BRCA1 is associated with holo-pol, as is the endogenous BRCA1. We applied the overexpression of tagged BRCA1 to the analysis of the HUIC. After infecting 293S cells with full-length BRCA1, we treated the cells with 10 mm HU for 16 h before extraction. Chromatography on Biorex70 was unchanged (data not shown), and analysis of the 0.6 m KOAc peak on sucrose gradient revealed that there was no shift of the overexpressed HA-BRCA1 into the HUIC, in contrast to the shift observed with endogenous BRCA1 in HeLa cells (compare Fig. 3Bwith Fig. 2C). When we analyzed uninfected 293S cells for endogenous BRCA1 and the effect of HU treatment on these cells, it was apparent that without HU treatment, BRCA1 sedimented in three peaks. The BRCA1-containing fractions were consistent with the fraction 5 complex and the holo-pol having the highest BRCA1 content, but BRCA1 was also detected at low levels in fractions consistent with the HUIC (Fig. 3B). This analysis was complicated by a nonspecific band migrating slightly faster than the BRCA1 (indicated by anasterisk) in fractions 17–23. Treatment with HU decreased the BRCA1 content of the first peak and the second peak and increased the BRCA1 content in the HUIC. This result was similar to the shift of BRCA1 protein into the HUIC observed in HU-treated HeLa cells. It is unclear why overexpression of full-length BRCA1 should interfere with the formation of the HUIC when the less expressed endogenous protein apparently does associate with the HUIC. Overexpressing BRCA1 causes G1 arrest and growth suppression (data not shown; Refs.33MacLachlan T.K. Somasundaram K. Sgagias M. Shifman Y. Muschel R.J. Cowan K.H. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol.

Because the HUIC was observed in a replication blockade that occurs in S phase, it is presumed that overexpression of full-length BRCA1 might be incompatible with BRCA1 association with the HUIC. Because it is reported that several deletion mutants do not induce G1 arrest and growth suppression (34Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 35Abbott D.W. Thompson M.E. Robinson-Benion C. Tomlinson G. Jensen R.A. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18808-18812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we constructed several deletion mutants of HA-BRCA1. One of the deletion mutants, HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) (Fig. 3A), was inserted into recombinant adenovirus and used to infect 293S cells. HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) did not suppress the growth of cells (data not shown). Infected whole-cell extracts were chromatographed on Biorex70 matrix and analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for the HA tag. HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) eluted primarily in the 0.6m KOAc peak, consistent with the wild type BRCA1 (data not shown). When we subjected the 0.6 m KOAc fraction of HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) to sucrose gradient sedimentation, three peaks were observed in the same positions on the gradient as observed with endogenous BRCA1 (Fig. 3B). HU treatment decreased the BRCA1 content present in the fraction 5 and holo-pol peaks and increased the BRCA1 content in fractions consistent with the HUIC (Fig.3B). This pattern of redistribution of BRCA1 content after HU treatment from complexes of higher mass to the HUIC, which was originally observed in HeLa cells, was repeated in 293S cells. We analyzed these fractions for BARD1 and for Rad50 because these proteins are known to interact with BRCA1. We found that the sedimentation of BARD1 did not change after HU treatment. BARD1 was present throughout the gradient, but with peaks consistent with the fraction 5 and the HUIC (Fig. 3B). Rad50 sedimented in fractions at the top of the gradient regardless of HU treatment (Fig.3B), suggesting that either BARD1 or Rad50 may be associated with BRCA1 in the HUIC. By comparison, Pol II did not cosediment with the HUIC (Fig. 1; data not shown). We tested whether the HUIC was a derivative of the holo-pol by immunoprecipitation using the holoenzyme-specific affinity-purified antibody directed against Med17 (30Chao D.M. Gadbois E.L. Murray P.J. Anderson S.F. Sonu M.S. Parvin J.D. Young R.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig.4A). Fractions 5, 17, and 25 containing HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) (from Fig. 3B) were immunoprecipitated with the Med17-specific antibody, and the blot was stained for the HA epitope (Fig. 4A). These fractions were chosen because they represent the peaks of the fraction 5, holo-pol, and HUIC complexes. When analyzing fraction 17, which had sedimentation consistent with the holo-pol, significant purification of HA-BRCA1 by the Med17-specific antibody was observed (lanes 4–6), indicating association of the HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) with the holo-pol. By contrast, the HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) in fraction 25, the HUIC-containing fraction, was not at all associated with Med17 (lanes 7–9). The very faint band in lane 9probably resulted from contamination of the HUIC by the holo-pol, which sedimented in adjacent fractions. This result suggests that the HUIC is a distinct complex from the holo-pol. The results of the IP from fraction 5 were weakly positive (lanes 1–3), suggesting that the protein complex in this sample may be derived from the holo-pol. BRCA1 has been reported to interact with the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 repair complex and also with BARD1 (8Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 20Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), and these proteins all copurify with the HUIC (Fig. 3B). We tested whether the HUIC is the same as the BRCA1-Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex by immunopurification using Mre11-specific antiserum. Whereas the Mre11 antibody could purify Mre11 and Rad50, HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) and BARD1 were not detected (Fig.4B). Thus, the HUIC is not the same as the Rad50-containing complex. By contrast, we have identified a BRCA1-associated protein in the HUIC. Anti-HA epitope immunopurification from the HUIC-containing samples revealed that BARD1 was present in this complex (Fig.4C). It has been reported that the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex associates with BRCA1 (20Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), but we did not observe this complex in HUIC fractions even though the proteins cosediment. A small pool of BRCA1 was observed in the 0.3 mKOAc elution of the Biorex70 column (Fig. 2B), and most of the total Rad50 in the extract was in the 0.3 m KOAc elution (data not shown). The 0.3 m KOAc Biorex70 eluate was analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation (Fig.5A). Samples expressing full-length HA-BRCA1 were subjected to Western blot analysis and stained for the HA epitope, Rad50, Mre11, and Nbs1. These patterns are similar to Rad50, Mre11, and Nbs1 sedimentation in fractions 15–23. HA-BRCA1 was present in these samples but also shifted to a higher molecular mass and fractionated in fractions 13–23. This shift in BRCA1 content was likely due to contamination by holo-pol (data not shown). Next, we tested whether BRCA1 is associated with Rad50 in this 0.3 m KOAc chromatographic fraction using anti-Mre11 antibody. In this fraction, full-length HA-BRCA1 was associated with Mre11, as was Rad50 (Fig. 5B). Finally, we tested whether HU, which causes damaged DNA, would stimulate association of endogenous BRCA1 with the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex. Although it has been reported that HU treatment causes a colocalization of BRCA1 and Rad50 complex (26Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), HU treatment did not stimulate BRCA1 association with the Rad50 complex (Fig. 5C). Here we report the chromatographic separation of four BRCA1-containing complexes. Upon Biorex70 chromatography, the BRCA1-Rad50 complex elutes in the 0.3 m KOAc fraction and is thus readily resolved from the other three complexes. By sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis of the Biorex70 0.6 m KOAc fraction, we purified the fraction 5 complex, holo-pol complex, and the HUIC (summarized in Fig. 6). We identified the HUIC, and we demonstrated that it contains BARD1. The subnuclear localization of BRCA1 and BARD1 changes in the S phase after treatment with HU or UV to proliferating cell nuclear antigen-containing replication structures (28Scully R. Chen J.

Kleiman and Manley (5Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 743-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) found that BRCA1/BARD1/CstF represses nuclear mRNA polyadenylation in vitro and that mRNA 3′ processing is transiently inhibited in cells treated with HU or UV. CstF50 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen interact strongly in a two-hybrid screen. We suggest that the HUIC protein complex identified in this study likely functions as the protein complex responsible for the activity that represses polyadenylation of mRNAs (4Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Science. 1999; 285: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The fraction 5 complex is massive, with a sedimentation coefficient of 60 S or greater. Previous experiments showed that this complex is associated with RNA (23Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and in this study, we show that it does contain the Med17 holo-pol component. It is possible that the fraction 5 complex results from artifactual association with ribosomes or hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) particles, both of which sediment in this portion of the gradient. Further characterization of the fraction 5 complex will clarify this. It is shown in this study that the BRCA1 content in the fraction 5 is regulated because HU treatment results in a profound decrease in BRCA1 protein in this fraction. For this reason, we suggest that BRCA1 association with the fraction 5 complex is likely to be biologically meaningful. The association of BRCA1 with the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex was not stimulated by HU. We anticipated that this association would be stimulated by HU because HU causes DNA replication arrest with DNA gaps that would likely induce a damage response. Our result with no increase in the association between BRCA1 and the Rad50 repair complex after HU treatment is consistent with similar results from another laboratory after γ-irradiation or methyl methanesulfonate treatment (20Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). If anything, HU treatment resulted in a decrease in BRCA1 content in the Rad50 complex, suggesting that BRCA1 is also dynamically shifting from this complex to the HUIC. Current data have not yet determined whether the BRCA1-Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex we have identified is the same as the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex. BRCA1-BARD1 interactions are demonstrated in the most abundant BRCA1-containing complexes. As mentioned above, the redistribution of BRCA1 among protein complexes is consistent with changes noted in subnuclear localization (28Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 29Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F. Tomlinson G. Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Scully R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 317-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). We observed clearly that BRCA1 content shifted from the holo-pol complex and fraction 5 complex to the HUIC after HU treatment of cells. This shift was less apparent for the BRCA1-Rad50 complex. Is the HUIC a product derived from the holo-pol complex or from the fraction 5 complex? We found that the HUIC does not contain the holo-pol components Med17, Pol II, and BRG1 (data not shown), and in sucrose gradient sedimentation of the 0.6 mKOAc elution, BARD1 fractionated broadly throughout the gradient, including two peaks consistent with the fraction 5 complex and the HUIC. It is possible that HU treatment leads to degradation of holo-pol and the fraction 5 complexes, leaving a residual BRCA1-BARD1-containing complex in the HUIC. This hypothesis is consistent with a model in which transcription functions in surveillance for DNA damage by transcription-coupled repair and recombination (6Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5952-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Upon encountering DNA damage, the BRCA1-BARD1 ubiquitin ligase activity destroys the holo-pol, leaving the HUIC at the site of damage, and the HUIC then recruits repair factors. BRCA1 is a dynamic protein because it is present in untreated cycling cells in three complexes, but after replication blockage by HU treatment, the BRCA1 content shifts to a new protein complex, the HUIC. It is likely that BRCA1 protein participates in multiple cellular pathways by different functions in different complexes. We thank S. Ganesan, D. Livingston, R. Baer, R. Kingston, A. Dutta, E.

The β3C598Y mutation, but not the β3C177A or β3C273A mutations, induced spontaneous binding of the ligand mimetic monoclonal antibody PAC-1, while the β3C177A and β3C273A mutants exhibited reduced complex stability in the absence of Ca2+.

In contrast, disruption of each of the disulfide bonds in the two long insertions of the I-like domain predicted to be in close contact with the α subunit β-propeller domain affect the stability of the αIIbβ3heterodimer and inhibit complex-specific mAb binding without affecting the RGD binding capacity of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site-like domain.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). During the process of receptor-ligand interaction, integrins function as allosteric receptors able to switch from a low to a high affinity ligand binding state (2Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). This molecular switch is thought to rely on conformational changes of the ectodomain of the receptor, brought about by intracellular signaling pathways in connection with integrin cytoplasmic tails and known as inside-out signaling (2Hughes P.E.

Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Conformational changes that coincide with receptor activation have been monitored by fluorescence energy transfer studies (4Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as activation-dependent monoclonal antibodies (5Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding to activated αIIbβ3itself induces additional conformational changes linked to the exposure of neoantigenic sites termed ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS)1 that are present on the occupied receptor but not on the resting receptor (6Frelinger A.L.

Chem. 1990; 265: 20594-20601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Certain of these anti-LIBS antibodies also mimic physiologic inside-out signaling by increasing the ligand binding affinity of αIIbβ3 (7Frelinger III, A.L. Du X.P. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kouns W.C. Wall C.D. White M.M. Fox C.F. Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20594-20601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although the molecular basis for the conformational changes associated with integrin receptor function modulation is still elusive, evidence has recently been provided that sulfhydryls may contribute to receptor function and that thiol bond reshuffling could represent a possible mechanism responsible for the conformational changes necessary for integrin activation (10Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Blocking of free sulfhydryls on the platelet surface inhibits platelet adhesion to collagen, fibronectin, and fibrinogen (11Lahav J. Gofer-Dadosh N. Luboshitz J. Hess O. Shaklai M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), platelet aggregation following ADP stimulation (10Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol.

Shaklai M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), suggesting that free sulfhydryls play an important role in the process of integrin-ligand interaction and that sulfhydryl blockers could act downstream of the conversion of the integrin high affinity state, possibly on the process of ligand binding itself. On the other hand, mild reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol, can increase the ligand binding function of αIIbβ3 as well as other integrins, a method commonly used to activate recombinant integrins in transfected nucleated cells (12Zucker M.B.

Also, disruption of the long range Cys5–Cys435 disulfide bond in the β3 subunit by site-directed mutagenesis or by mild proteolytic cleavage results in an increased affinity of αIIbβ3 for fibrinogen (18Niewiarowski S. Kornecki E. Hershock D. Tuszynski G.P. Bennett J.S. Soria C. Soria J. Dunn F. Pidard D. Kieffer N. Nurden A.T. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1985; 106: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar, 19Valentin N. Visentin G.P.

Evidence has also been provided that mutational introduction of disulfide bonds into the αLβ2 integrin I domain locks this receptor in an open ligand binding or closed nonbinding conformation (22Lu C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that a small number of cysteines, located within the epidermal growth factor-like cysteine-rich repeats (CRR) of the β3 subunit, are unpaired and exhibit the properties of a redox site that could be involved in integrin activation. This αIIbβ3 activation appears to be controlled by a protein-disulfide isomerase activity (24Essex D.W. Chen K. Swiatkowska M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2168-2173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Essex D.W. Li M. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 104: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), recently shown to be an intrinsic activity of integrin αIIbβ3(26O'Neill S. Robinson A. Deering A. Ryan M. Fitzgerald D.J. Moran N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36984-36990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These data suggest that disulfide bond reshuffling in the β3 subunit could be a potential mechanism involved in αIIbβ3 receptor activation and ligand binding.In this study, we have investigated the structural and functional relevance of the two disulfide bonds, Cys177–Cys184 and Cys233–Cys273, present in two long insertions supposedly located on the same side of the I-like domain and facing the α subunit β propeller domain (27Huang C. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21514-21524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), as well as a third disulfide bond involving Cys598 linked to Cys588 and located in the fourth repeat of the C-terminal CRR of β3. Our results provide evidence that disruption of a single cysteine disulfide bond in the cysteine-rich repeat domain, but not in the I-like domain, activates integrin αIIbβ3. In contrast, disruption of each of the disulfide bonds in the two long insertions of the I-like domain affects the stability of the αIIbβ3 heterodimer and inhibits complex-specific mAb binding, without modifying the RGD binding capacity of the MIDAS-like domain.DISCUSSIONThe β3 integrin subunit contains 56 cysteine residues that are highly conserved in all β subunits and are essentially located in the two cysteine-rich domains, the N-terminal PSI domain and the C-terminal CRR domain, while the β subunit I-like domain has only two intradomain disulfide bonds. A long range Cys5–Cys435 loop that brings the PSI domain into close contact with the CRR domain appears to be of particular importance, since disruption of this loop through cysteine mutation induces a major conformational change leading to receptor activation (20Liu C.Y. Sun Q.H. Wang R. Paddock C.M. Newman P.J. Blood. 1997; 90 (abstr.): 573Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, mutational disruption of the Cys406–Cys655 loop of the second long range thiol bond appears to have no effect on αIIbβ3 receptor function (44Wang R. Peterson J. Aster R.H. Newman P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 1718-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far, no structural or functional role has been attributed to cysteine residues present in the I-like domain or the CRR domain. However, with the recent demonstration that each CRR domain of integrin β subunits has two highly conserved cysteine rich motives, with motive I containing the active site tetrapeptide CXXC of the ubiquitous thiol-modifying enzymes protein-disulfide isomerase and thioredoxin, and with the evidence that integrin αIIbβ3exhibits an endogenous thiol isomerase activity (26O'Neill S. Robinson A. Deering A. Ryan M. Fitzgerald D.J. Moran N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36984-36990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it has become apparent that cysteine residues in the CRR domain could play a major role in receptor activation.Here we have investigated the structural and functional relevance of the two unique disulfide bonds present in the I-like domain, Cys177–Cys184 and Cys232–Cys273, as well as a disulfide bond, Cys588–Cys598, located in the fourth repeat of the CRR domain and disrupted in a Glanzmann type II patient due to a C598Y substitution. The Cys177–Cys184 and Cys232–Cys273 loops are of particular interest, since they are located in two long insertions not present in α subunit I-domains. According to the quaternary structural model of the β2 subunit I-like domain developed by Zang et al. (36Zang Q. Lu C. Huang C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22202-22212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9), or the structural model of Tuckwell and Humphries (37Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), one inserted loop is tied down to the back of the I-like domain by a disulfide bond corresponding to Cys232–Cys273 in the β3 subunit. The second corresponds to the Cys177–Cys184loop defined in β1 and β3 integrins and located near the top of the I-like domain. The two loops are located on the same side of the I-like domain and have been reported to face the ligand binding domain in the proposed β propeller domain of the αIIb subunit (38Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The β3177CYDMKTTC184 sequence has previously been shown to be critical for ligand binding and ligand specificity and is called the specificity-determining loop (39Takagi J. Kamata T. Meredith J. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19794-19800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). More importantly, the sequence within this Cys177–Cys184 loop appears to be part of the discontinuous antigenic sites recognized by some ligand-mimetic monoclonal antibodies, and amino acid substitutions in this sequence prevent ligand-mimetic monoclonal antibody as well as fibrinogen binding (38Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Cys232–Cys273 bond, which does not exist in the β4 integrin subunit, is in close proximity to the hexapeptide 275VGSDNH280 in the β3 subunit that confers species restricted heterodimer assembly to αIIbβ3 (40McKay B.S. Annis D.S. Honda S. Christie D. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30544-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). And finally, Cys598 is located in the conserved motif II of the fourth CRR and is part of a small tryptic fragment of the fourth CRR (residues 581–600) that has recently been identified to contain unpaired cysteines (10Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).By mutating the cysteine residues Cys177 or Cys273 into alanine and Cys598 into tyrosine, we disrupted each of the three cysteine loops by creating free sulfhydryls. Indeed, the expressed β3 Ala177, β3 Ala273, and β3Tyr598 mutants, when studied under nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE, exhibited a slower than normal electrophoretic mobility as compared with wild type β3, a result consistent with that observed for other β3 cysteine mutations, such as C457Y (41Milet S. Bourre O. Peyuruchaud E. Cazez R. Combrié Nurden P. Nurden A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78 (abstr.): 360Google Scholar) or C542R (42Ruan J. Schmugge M. Clemetson K.J. Cazes E. Combrié R. Bourre F. Nurden A.T. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 105: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this difference in electrophoretic mobility was not observed for the purified resting (AS-1) and active αIIbβ3 (AS-2) receptors, reported to differ in the number and position of unpaired cysteines (10Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The three mutations investigated here had a clear inhibitory effect on αIIbβ3 biosynthesis, processing, and cell surface exposure. However, these mutations did not prevent αIIbβ3-mediated cell spreading on immobilized fibrinogen or translocation of the mutant receptors into focal adhesion plaques. Similar results have been reported for other β3 mutants, such as β3L196P (43Kieffer N. Morel-Kopp M.-C. Melchior C. Kaplan C. Blood. 1999; 94 Suppl. I (abstr.): 445Google Scholar), β3C345A (20Liu C.Y. Sun Q.H. Wang R. Paddock C.M. Newman P.J. Blood. 1997; 90 (abstr.): 573Crossref Google Scholar), or β3C655Y (19Valentin N. Visentin G.P.

These data tend to support the notion that αIIbβ3-mediated cell spreading on immobilized fibrinogen, which relies essentially on the fibrinogen γ chain dodecapeptide interaction with the αIIb subunit, is not affected by single amino acid substitutions in the β3subunit.Previous data have provided evidence that residues within the Cys177–Cys184 loop are critical for ligand specificity (39Takagi J. Kamata T. Meredith J. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19794-19800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and αIIbβ3 ligand binding (38Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Replacement in the β3 subunit of residues 177–184 with the corresponding sequence of the β1 subunit changed the ligand specificity of αvβ3 by blocking αvβ3 binding to multiple ligands and to mAb LM609, while the reciprocal mutation conferred to αvβ1 the binding specificity for von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, and vitronectin (39Takagi J. Kamata T. Meredith J. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19794-19800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This Cys177–Cys184 sequence has also been shown to be part of the discontinuous binding sites recognized by some ligand-mimetic mAbs, and amino acid substitutions in this sequence blocked fibrinogen binding as well as ligand mimetic mAb binding such as OP-G2 or the function-blocking mAbs A2A9 and 7E3 (38Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here we show a distinct effect of the C177A and C273A mutation on complex-specific and blocking monoclonal antibody binding to αIIbβ3. While none of the C177A or C273A mutations had an effect on β3 subunit specific mAb binding, such as P37, Y251, 4F8, or SZ21, they both inhibited the binding of the complex-specific and blocking mAbs A2A9, 10E5, pL2–46, and P256. In contrast, only the C177A mutation affected AP2, 7E3, and LM609 binding, while the C273A mutation had no inhibitory effect. Our data demonstrate that disruption of the Cys177–Cys184 loop affects the epitopes for AP2 and LM609, which have been localized to the Glu171–Glu174 sequence close to the Cys177–Cys184 loop, as well as the epitope for 7E3 located within the Cys177–Cys184 loop. In contrast, the epitopes for the complex-specific antibodies such as A2A9 appear to be more complex, since disruption of either the Cys177–Cys184 or the Cys232–Cys277 loop inhibited antibody recognition.Our data also show that disruption of the Cys177–Cys184 or the Cys232–Cys273 loop, but not of the Cys588–Cys598 loop, decreased the stability of the αβ heterodimer and that these mutant complexes, in contrast to the wild type complex, dissociated in the absence of Ca2+but could be stabilized following the addition of Ca2+. A similar sensitivity to Ca2+ ions and decreased stability of the αIIbβ3 complex has been observed in several GT patients with known single amino acid mutations such as R214W (45Nurden A.T. Rosa J.P.

Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the structural integrity of the two insertions of the I-like domain, in close contact with the α subunit β propeller domain, is important for stable αβ heterodimerization of αIIbβ3. These data are in accordance with previous studies showing that β3 subunit residues 217–298 and 324–366 are involved in α/β heterodimerization (50Calvete J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, amino acids in β3 necessary for the selective αIIbβ3 subunit compatibility have been identified in a short sequence encompassing residues 275–280 (40McKay B.S. Annis D.S. Honda S. Christie D. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30544-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,51Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar).An interesting finding is the selective exposure on the mutant αIIbβ3C177A receptor of an epitope identified by monoclonal antibody 4D10G3. This antibody does not bind to resting or activated platelets or to the native recombinant αIIbβ3 receptor exposed on the cell surface, but it interacts with SDS-denatured β3, suggesting that in the native receptor, the epitope is cryptic and not accessible for 4D10G3 mAb recognition. Surface exposure of this epitope, which we have mapped to the nonreduced 60-kDa chymotrypsin fragment of the β3 subunit, comprising the disulfide linked peptides spanning residues 1–101 and 349–762, demonstrates that cryptic sequence of the β3 subunit not contained within the I-like domain is exposed following disruption of the Cys177–Cys184 loop. These data suggest that disruption of this Cys177–Cys184 loop not only affects the structure of the I-like domain, but influences also the N terminus and the central domain of the β3 subunit. We therefore investigated LIBS epitope expression following disruption of the three cysteine bonds. Quite surprisingly, in the absence of receptor activation, all three cell clones spontaneously bound the LIBS mAbs AP5, D3, LIBS1, and LIBS2, suggesting that LIBS epitope mapping on β3 only poorly relates to specific β3subunit conformational changes induced by selective mutations.A number of naturally occurring cysteine mutations in the β3 subunit have been identified in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients, which are essentially located in the CRR domain, such as C457Y (41Milet S. Bourre O. Peyuruchaud E. Cazez R. Combrié Nurden P. Nurden A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78 (abstr.): 360Google Scholar), C506Y (52French D.L. Bussel J. Li J. Scudder L. Coller B.S.

T., Newman, P., and Valentin, N. (2001) Thromb. Haemostasis , 86, Abstr. 58.Google Scholar), and the C598Y initially identified by Schlegel et al. (29Schlegel N. Chen P. Binard S. Maisonneuve L. Rosa J.P. Kieffer N. Caen J. Blood. 1999; 94 Suppl. I (abstr.): 451Google Scholar) and investigated here. All mutations, except C508Y, were responsible for reduced β3 surface expression in platelets, a result confirmed for most of these mutations following transfection of the mutant receptor in mammalian cells. Some of the β3 mutants (C457Y, C542Y) exhibited a slower than normal migration in SDS-PAGE, similar to that observed for β3C598Y, demonstrating that these cysteines are engaged in a disulfide bond. Interestingly, Cys457 and Cys506 correspond to the N-terminal and C-terminal residues of the highly conserved tetrapeptide CGXC in motive I of the first and second CRR, respectively. On the other hand, Cys560 and Cys598 are each part of a CRR motive II. It is noteworthy that previously reported mutations of Cys457 (41Milet S. Bourre O. Peyuruchaud E. Cazez R. Combrié Nurden P. Nurden A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78 (abstr.): 360Google Scholar) and Cys542 (42Ruan J. Schmugge M. Clemetson K.J. Cazes E. Combrié R. Bourre F. Nurden A.T. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 105: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) located in CRR motives I had no effect on receptor function, while mutations of Cys598 shown here and Cys560 reported by Ruizet al. (54Ruiz, C., Liu, C., Sun, Q., Sigaud-Fiks, M., Fressinaud, E., Muller, J. Y., Nurden, P., Nurden, A. T., Newman, P., and Valentin, N. (2001) Thromb. Haemostasis , 86, Abstr. 58.Google Scholar) both induce receptor activation. Interestingly, Cys598 is comprised within the small tryptic β3 fragment (residues 581–600) identified by Yanet al. (10Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and shown to contain unpaired cysteines. Thus, the fact that the C598Y mutation induced spontaneous PAC-1 binding suggests that Cys598 is potentially involved in disulfide bond reshuffling, necessary for receptor activation. Finally, since the C560R and C598Y mutations have been identified in the integrin β3 subunit of patients with defective platelet aggregation, the thrombasthenic phenotype of the platelets of these patients can only be explained by the low expression level of the mutant αIIbβ3 receptor.In summary, our results provide evidence that disruption of a single cysteine disulfide bond in the cysteine-rich repeat domain, but not in the I-like domain, activates integrin αIIbβ3. In contrast, disruption of each of the disulfide bonds in the two long insertions of the I-like domain predicted to be in close contact with the α subunit β-propeller domain affects the stability of the αIIbβ3heterodimer without modifying the RGD binding capacity of the MIDAS-like domain. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors that mediate cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions and regulate numerous aspects of cell behavior such as cell motility, proliferation, differentiation, and"

Both reactions have properties, including a tolerance of base analog substitutions that tend to eliminate major groove hydrogen bonding potential, that suggest a common molecular process underlies the DNA strand exchange promoted by RecA and Rad51. However, optimal conditions for the DNA pairing and DNA strand exchange reactions promoted by the RecA and Rad51 proteins in vitroare substantially different. When conditions are optimized independently for both proteins, RecA promotes DNA pairing reactions with short oligonucleotides at a faster rate than Rad51. For both proteins, conditions that improve DNA pairing can inhibit extensive DNA strand exchange reactions in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. Extensive strand exchange requires a spooling of duplex DNA into a recombinase-ssDNA complex, a process that can be halted by any interaction elsewhere on the same duplex that restricts free rotation of the duplex and/or complex, I.e. the reaction can get stuck.

The first phase is the formation of a RecA or Rad51 protein helical filament on the single-stranded DNA substrate. This is followed by alignment of homologous DNA sequences between the protein/ssDNA filaments and the duplex substrate. Alignment is followed closely by, or perhaps in concert with, a strand switch where the complementary strand of the duplex substrate is transferred to the DNA strand within the filament. None of these processes requires ATP hydrolysis (4Sung P. Stratton S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Morrison C.

Once DNA alignment and strand transfer has begun, a third phase occurs in which the nascent hybrid duplex DNA can be extended over thousands of base pairs. For RecA protein, this third phase is generally coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP (13Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

RecA and Rad51 are frequently cited as functional and structural homologs, based on amino acid sequence similarities (23Story R.M. Bishop D.K. Kleckner N. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1892-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the apparent similarity in their filament structures (24Ogawa T., Yu, X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), and the DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions they both promote. Both proteins require a single strand DNA-binding protein (bacterial SSB or eukaryotic RPA) for an optimal DNA strand exchange reaction. For both RecA and Rad51, the requirements for homologous pairing, other than the DNA substrates and recombinase, vary among reports but presumably include ATP (or certain ATP analogs), Mg2+ in sufficient concentration to coordinate the nucleotide cofactor, and a multivalent cation. This cationic species is usually additional magnesium but is often replaced with spermidine in experiments with yeast Rad51 protein (2Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). To date, there has been little attempt to compare directly the two proteins side by side. Our study initiates this potentially revealing comparison with an exploration of the effects of altered DNA substrates and solution conditions. The altered DNA substrates were chosen to expand the range of useful substrates for these reactions and to provide additional insight into the DNA pairing process. In a previous report (21Rice K.P. Chaput J.C. Cox M.M. Switzer C.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10177-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we provided evidence that the molecular basis for homologous pairing is likely conserved among bacteria and yeast, based upon the capacity of both proteins to make use of DNA substrates containing base analogs with non-canonical functionality. The mechanism of DNA pairing remains uncertain, with the controversy focusing largely on two competing mechanisms. First is the R-form DNA hypothesis. In this model, the bound single strand within a RecA or Rad51 filament is aligned with a homologous duplex DNA (dsDNA) via non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding in its major groove, allowing a transient formation of a novel DNA triplex (Fig. 1) (25Lacks S.

Protein binding interactions within the groove would extend the DNA and facilitate base flipping within one strand of the dsDNA, permitting a homology search based on Watson-Crick interactions between the flipped bases and the ssDNA bound within the RecA filament. A detailed study has verified key predictions of the base-flipping proposal (43Gupta R.C. Folta-Stogniew E. O'Malley S. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. Mol.

For all of their similarities, the differences between RecA protein and Rad51 protein are at least as intriguing and potentially more informative. Rad51 protein can readily nucleate filament formation on either ssDNA or dsDNA (17Sung P. Robberson D.L.

The role of ATP hydrolysis in the reactions promoted by RecA is not completely understood, and a fundamental difference in the use of ATP by RecA and Rad51 proteins clearly exists that has not been explained (1Cox M.M.

We also note that an extensive Rad51-promoted DNA strand exchange reaction is highly dependent on the addition of single strand DNA-binding proteins, with the cognate replication protein A (RPA) being quite effective (2Sung P.

For RecA protein, the E. coli SSB protein is stimulatory, but significant reaction can occur in its absence. The differences extend to the conditions under which optimal DNA pairing and strand exchange are observed. In general, RecA protein functions best in a buffer with added Mg2+. The Mg2+ is required to form active complexes with ATP, to enhance DNA pairing interactions, and to optimize extensive strand exchange reactions (8Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc.

A. 1985; 82: 5646-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), with ratios much in excess of 1.0 necessary for optimal DNA strand exchange. All reports of Rad51 protein-mediated DNA strand exchange also include Mg2+ in the reaction protocol, but high levels of Mg2+ permit only limited DNA strand exchange. Reported yields in Rad51-promoted DNA strand exchange reactions have been quite variable (3Namsaraev E. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 56Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C.

With the yeast Rad51 protein, high yields are generally observed only in the presence of the polycation spermidine (2Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 17Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), whereas the best reactions with human Rad51 protein are seen when ammonium sulfate is included (18Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B.W. Stratton S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8798-8806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our comparison of the DNA strand exchange activities of RecA and Rad51 proteins explores a wide range of conditions and several DNA substrates, but ultimately focuses on the DNA pairing process itself and the role of ATP. Based on the effects of Mg2+ on the DNA strand exchange reaction promoted by the mutant RecA K72R (which binds but does not hydrolyze ATP), we proposed a model previously (9Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) for extensive DNA strand exchange in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. With high levels of Mg2+, DNA pairing was highly efficient but did not lead to extensive strand exchange because of topological barriers imposed by stable secondary DNA pairing events. Lower levels of Mg2+ supported less DNA pairing but allowed for the slow completion of extensive DNA strand exchange (9Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In other words, extensive DNA strand exchange in the absence of ATP hydrolysis can be blocked if the fundamental DNA pairing process is sufficiently facile. A similar result has recently been obtained with the human Rad51, where efficient DNA strand exchange requires solution additions that weaken the interaction between the Rad51-ssDNA complex and the duplex DNA (18Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B.W. Stratton S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8798-8806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that under conditions for DNA strand exchange that are optimized separately for the RecA and Rad51 proteins, the RecA protein pairs DNA more efficiently than does the Rad51 protein. However, the weaker DNA pairing function allows Rad51 to promote an extensive DNA strand exchange process efficiently with little or no ATP hydrolysis. We also continue our exploration of the range of DNA substrates tolerated in DNA strand exchange processes (21Rice K.P. Chaput J.C. Cox M.M. Switzer C.Y.

D and E differ from B and C only by the addition of a single nucleotide at their 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively. Lyophilized oligonucleotides were resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-Cl (80% cation), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) and stored at −20 °C. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled by incubating with T4 polynucleotide kinase (5–10 units) and [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 µm) for 30 min at 37 °C in the buffer recommended by the enzyme supplier (final concentrations: 70 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmDTT) with a final reaction volume of 50 µl. Unincorportated nucleotide was removed with the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal kit (Qiagen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer and eluted in no more than 50 µl of TE. The dsDNA 40-mer substrates were formed by annealing the two complementary ssDNA 40-mers and then heating to 85 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were isolated from single strands by electrophoresis in 10% acrylamide, 1× TBE (45 mm Tris borate (50% cation), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8)) native gels. Radiolabeled bands were visualized by a 10-s exposure to x-ray film. Processed film was placed under the gel to facilitate band identification; the bands were then excised with a razor blade. DNA was extracted from excised intact gel slices by three successive incubations of at least 1 h in 1 ml of TE at 37 °C. After each incubation, the liquid was removed and the DNA concentrated in Microcon-10 concentrators (Amicon) for 30 min at 14,000 ×g with the next extraction liquid being added to the previously concentrated material and then re-concentrated. Unlabeled dsDNA 40-mers were generated by mixing equimolar amounts of the two complementary strands in TE at a final concentration of 1600 µm nucleotides.

Linear double-stranded φX174 DNA was generated from a restriction digestion of φX174 replicative form I DNA (from New England Biolabs). Aliquots of this DNA (100 µg) were incubated with 200 units ofPstI in the supplied buffer (90 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl) in a final volume of 200 µl. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before a 20-min heat inactivation at 80 °C. The DNA was purified from the mixture using 2 QIAquick polymerase chain reaction purification spin columns (Qiagen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The DNA was eluted in a total volume of 150 µl of TE. Linear dsDNA concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 260 nm using the extinction coefficient, 20 A260mg−1 ml cm−1. DNA pairing reactions were carried out in 20 mm Tris-OAc buffer (80% cation) with added 1 mm DTT, 1% glycerol, and 1 mmMg(OAc)2 at 38 °C. DNA, protein, and NTP cofactor concentrations are listed in figure legends. The 70-mer ssDNA substrate was preincubated with RecA protein and ATPγS for 10 min. Additional reaction components were added to the preincubation as indicated. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the 32P-labeled 40-mer dsDNA substrate and reagent additives as indicated with a final reaction volume of 150 µl. The final pH after addition of all reaction components was 7.55. Aliquots of 9 µl were removed at the indicated times and stopped with the addition of EDTA and SDS to final concentrations of 20 mm and 1%, respectively, in a final volume of 12 µl. A gel loading buffer (2.5% Ficoll (type 400), 0.08% bromphenol blue, 0.08% xylene cyanol FF, all final concentrations) was then added to each stopped aliquot, followed by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide, 1× TBE gels. Bands were visualized by exposure to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics) for 30 min and scanned on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (model 425E).

https://openalex.org/W2080123385,"In non-polarized cells, CD98 has been shown to both influence beta(1) integrins and heterodimerize with LAT-2, which confers amino acid transport capability on the LAT-2/CD98 heterodimer. Since LAT-2 is most heavily expressed in intestine and CD98 associates with the beta(1) integrin splice form selectively found in such epithelia, we investigated the relationship and polarity of these proteins using the intestinal epithelial model Caco2-BBE. CD98 was found to selectively coimmunoprecipitate with both LAT-2 and beta(1) integrin, and, logically, all three proteins were polarized to the same (basolateral) domain. Furthermore, expression of CD98 in polarized epithelia lacking human CD98 (MDCK cells) disrupted beta(1) integrin surface distribution and cytoskeletal architecture, suggesting that CD98 can influence integrin function. Expression of a CD98 mutant lacking the specific residues conferring LAT-2 binding similarly affected cells, confirming that the latter effect was not due to LAT-2 sequestration. Use of CD98 truncation mutants suggest that a 10-amino acid domain located at the putative cytoplasmic tail/transmembrane domain interface was necessary and sufficient to induce the phenotype change. We conclude that the CD98/LAT-2 amino acid transporter is polarized to the same domain on which beta(1) integrin resides. CD98 appears to associate with beta(1) integrin and, in doing so, may influence its function as revealed by disruption of the outside-in signaling that confers cytoskeletal organization. Furthermore, such findings suggest a link between classic transport events and a critical element of barrier function: integrin-mediated influences on cytoskeletal organization."
https://openalex.org/W2161041868,"Human cyclin T1, a component of the P-TEFb kinase complex, was originally identified through its biochemical interaction with the Tat transactivator protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Current understanding suggests that binding of Tat to P-TEFb is required to promote efficient transcriptional elongation of viral RNAs. However, the dynamics and the subnuclear localization of this process are still largely unexplored in vivo. Here we exploit high resolution fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to visualize and quantitatively analyze the direct interaction between Tat and cyclin T1 inside the cells. We observed that cyclin T1 resides in specific subnuclear foci which are in close contact with nuclear speckles and that Tat determines its redistribution outside of these compartments. Consistent with this observation, strong FRET was observed between the two proteins both in the cytoplasm and in regions of the nucleus outside of cyclin T1 foci and overlapping with Tat localization. These results are consistent with a model by which Tat recruits cyclin T1 outside of the nuclear compartments where the protein resides to promote transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2009324487,"Ryanodine, a plant alkaloid, is one of the most widely used pharmacological probes for intracellular Ca2+ signaling in a variety of muscle and non-muscle cells. Upon binding to the Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor), ryanodine causes two major changes in the channel: a reduction in single-channel conductance and a marked increase in open probability. The molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the gating behavior and Ca2+ dependence of the wild type (wt) and a mutant cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) after being modified by ryanodine. Single-channel studies revealed that the ryanodine-modified wt RyR2 channel was sensitive to inhibition by Mg2+ and to activation by caffeine and ATP. In the presence of Mg2+, the ryanodine-modified single wt RyR2 channel displayed a sigmoidal Ca2+ dependence with an EC50 value of 110 nm, whereas the ryanodine-unmodified single wt channel exhibited an EC50 of 120 µm for Ca2+ activation, indicating that ryanodine is able to increase the sensitivity of the wt RyR2 channel to Ca2+activation by ∼1,000-fold. Furthermore, ryanodine is able to restore Ca2+ activation and ligand response of the E3987A mutant RyR2 channel that has been shown to exhibit ∼1,000-fold reduction in Ca2+ sensitivity to activation. The E3987A mutation, however, affects neither [3H]ryanodine binding to nor the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of ryanodine on the RyR2 channel. These results demonstrate that ryanodine does not “lock” the RyR channel into an open state as generally believed; rather, it sensitizes dramatically the channel to activation by Ca2+.

The unique and specific action of ryanodine on RyR function also has made it an invaluable pharmacological probe for intracellular Ca2+ signaling in a variety of cells (8Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar, 9Clapham D.E.

Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Ryanodine has dual actions on the Ca2+ release channel depending on its concentration. Ca2+ flux studies using sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles revealed that, at nanomolar to micromolar concentrations, ryanodine stimulates Ca2+release from sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, whereas, at higher concentrations (micromolar to millimolar range), ryanodine inhibits Ca2+ release (12Meissner G.

Consistent with these Ca2+ release studies, [3H]ryanodine binding analysis established the existence of low and high affinity ryanodine binding sites (16Pessah I.N. Zimanyi I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 679-689PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Inui M. Saito A.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Binding of ryanodine to the high affinity site was correlated with channel activation, whereas occupation of the low affinity ryanodine binding site was related to channel inhibition (19Wang J.P. Needleman D.H. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20974-20982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20McGrew S.G. Wolleben C. Siegl P. Inui M. Fleischer S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These opposite effects of ryanodine have been clearly demonstrated at the single-channel level. Addition of micromolar concentrations of ryanodine caused the RyR channel to enter into a long-lived open state with a reduced single-channel conductance (22Rousseau E. Smith J.S. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C364-C368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Smith J.S. Imagawa T. Ma J. Fill M. Campbell K.P. Coronado R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Exposure to high concentrations (submillimolar to millimolar) of ryanodine led to a persistent blockade of single RyR channels (11Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar,21Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying these complex changes in channel conductance and gating behavior of RyR upon ryanodine modification are not well understood. [3H]Ryanodine binding studies have suggested that complete blockade of the RyR channel by high concentrations of ryanodine may result from the occlusion of the channel conduction pore by ryanodine (19Wang J.P. Needleman D.H. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20974-20982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed characterization of the effects of ryanodine or ryanodine derivatives on ion handling by RyR has been reported. These studies have led to the proposal that reduction in channel conductance upon ryanodine modification is likely to result from allosteric alterations in ion permeation and ion binding, and/or from partial block by ryanodine (10Lindsay A.R. Tinker A. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 425-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Tinker A. Sutko J.L. Ruest L. Deslongchamps P. Welch W. Airey J.A. Gerzon K. Bidasee K.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Williams A.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2110-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Little is known about the molecular mechanism by which ryanodine increases the open probability (Po) of the RyR channels. Ryanodine is thought to “lock” the RyR channel into a subconductance open state upon binding, and the ryanodine-modified RyR channel is thought to be insensitive to modulation by other ligands such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and ruthenium red (5Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 11Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar,12Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6300-6306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rousseau E. Smith J.S. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C364-C368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The view that ryanodine locks the RyR channel in an open substate has recently been contested by Tanna et al. (25Tanna B. Welch W. Ruest L. Sutko J.L. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), who observed that the Po of the channel before ryanodine modification influenced the Po of the ryanodine-modified state. Low Po channels displayed more closing events than high Pochannels after modified by ryanodine. This observation suggests that ryanodine does not simply lock the channel into an open state. This observation also implies that activation of the RyR channel by ryanodine would be finite and regulatable. To test these possibilities, we have examined the gating properties and the Ca2+dependence of the ryanodine-modified wild type cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and a mutant RyR2 that exhibits a markedly reduced sensitivity to activation by Ca2+. Our results demonstrate that ryanodine-modified channels are sensitive to modulation, and that ryanodine increases dramatically the sensitivity of the RyR2 channel to activation by Ca2+. Ryanodine was obtained from Calbiochem. [3H]Ryanodine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Brain phosphatidylserine was from Avanti Polar Lipid. Synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were from Northern Lipids. HEK293 cells grown for 24–26 h after transfection using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl) plus 2.5 mm EDTA and were harvested in the same solution by centrifugation. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 0.6% egg phosphatidylcholine, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mix (1 mm benzamidine, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin A, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 1 h. Cell lysate was obtained after removing the unsolubilized materials by centrifugation in microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min. Recombinant wt and E3987A mutant RyR2 proteins used for single-channel recordings were purified from cell lysates by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Brain phosphatidylserine and synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine, dissolved in chloroform, were combined in a 1:5 ratio (w/w), dried under nitrogen gas, and suspended in 30 µl of n-decane at a concentration of 15 mg of lipid/ml. Bilayers were formed across a 250-µm hole in a Delrin partition separating two chambers. The trans chamber (600 µl) was connected to the head stage input of an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.). The cis chamber (1.2 ml) was held at virtual ground. A symmetrical solution containing 250 mm KCl and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, was used for all recordings. A 2–4 µl aliquot of the sucrose density gradient-purified recombinant wt or mutant RyR2 proteins was added to the cis chamber. Unless indicated otherwise, spontaneous channel activity was always tested for sensitivity to EGTA and Ca2+, thereby providing information about the Ca2+ sensitivity, orientation in the bilayer, and stability of the incorporated channel. All subsequent additions were made to that chamber in which the addition of EGTA inhibited the activity of the incorporated channel. This chamber presumably corresponds to the cytoplasmic side of the Ca2+ release channel. Recordings were filtered at 2,500 Hz. The data were analyzed using pClamp 6.0.3 software (Axon Instruments Inc.). Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the computer program of Fabiato and Fabiato (27Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 75: 463-505Google Scholar). Free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in transfected HEK293 cells was measured using the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3 AM, as described previously (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Transfected cells were collected and loaded with 10 µmfluo-3 AM in KRH buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 6 mmglucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 250 µm sulfinpyrazone (an organic anion transport inhibitor used for inhibiting the leakage of the fluo-3 dye) (28Baus E. Urbain J. Leo O. Andris F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 173: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with or without 500 µm ryanodine at room temperature for 2 h. After 2 h of loading, cells were washed with KRH buffer three times and resuspended in 150 µl of KRH buffer plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 250 µmsulfinpyrazone. The fluo-3-loaded cells were added to 2 ml of KRH buffer in a cuvette. Fluorescence intensity of fluo-3 at 530 nm was measured in an SLM-Aminco series 2 luminescence spectrometer with 480 nm excitation at 25 °C. Equilibrium [3H]ryanodine binding to cell lysates was carried out as described previously (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding mixture (300 µl) containing 30 µl of cell lysate, 500 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm caffeine, 15 nm[3H]ryanodine, and the protease inhibitor mix was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. To optimize [3H]ryanodine binding to the Ca2+-sensing mutant E3987A, 1 mm CaCl2 and 2.5 mm caffeine were included in the binding mix (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The binding mix after 2 h of incubation was diluted into 5 ml of dissociation buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 250 mm KCl, with or without 200 µm unlabeled ryanodine, and was further incubated at 37 °C for 0–240 min. The amount of [3H]ryanodine that remained bound was determined by membrane filtration assay using Whatman GF/B filters presoaked with 1% polyethylenimine. The filters were washed, and the radioactivities associated with the filters were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence of 30 µm unlabeled ryanodine. All binding assays were done in duplicate. Early single-channel studies showed that ryanodine increased the open probability (Po) of the RyR channel to near unity and that, at micromolar activating Ca2+ concentrations, the ryanodine-modified channels were inhibited only partially by Mg2+ and ruthenium red (22Rousseau E. Smith J.S. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C364-C368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led to the notion that ryanodine-modified RyR channels are insensitive to modulation (11Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the partial inhibition is that, at micromolar Ca2+concentrations, ryanodine activation may be too strong to be completely suppressed by Mg2+ and ruthenium red. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of Mg2+ on ryanodine-modified single RyR2 channels at nanomolar Ca2+concentrations. Fig. 1shows that a single mouse wt RyR2 channel displayed brief openings and minimalPo at submicromolar Ca2+concentrations. Addition of ryanodine abruptly shifted the channel into a state with long-lived openings and a marked increase inPo, and a reduced single-channel conductance (Fig. 1, a and b). The free Ca2+concentration was then reduced to ∼12 nm by addition of 0.43 mm EGTA, which resulted in only a small reduction inPo (Fig. 1 c). Subsequent addition of 2 mm MgCl2, however, decreased thePo of the ryanodine-modified channel markedly (Fig. 1 d). The Mg2+-inhibited, ryanodine-modified RyR2 channel could be reactivated by addition of caffeine and by addition of ATP (n = 4) (Fig. 1,e and f). Thus, in the presence of low concentrations of activating Ca2+, the ryanodine-modified RyR2 channels, like the ryanodine-unmodified channels, are sensitive to modulation by various channel regulators. To investigate the mechanism of ryanodine activation, we examined the Ca2+ dependence of ryanodine-modified single wt RyR2 channels. A single RyR2 channel was modified by ryanodine in the presence of ∼300 nmCa2+ and 2 mm Mg2+ (Fig.2A, a). The free Ca2+ concentration was subsequently reduced to various levels by addition of EGTA. As seen in Fig. 2 A, the ryanodine-modified single RyR2 channel was fully activated at ∼300 nm Ca2+ and was inhibited at ∼50 nm Ca2+, displaying a sigmoidal Ca2+ response (Fig. 2 C). Analysis of the Ca2+ dependence using the Hill equation yielded an EC50 of 100 nm and a Hill coefficient of 3 in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 2 C). On the other hand, the ryanodine-unmodified channel in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ was activated by Ca2+ at micromolar concentrations and was inactivated at ∼10 mmCa2+ (Fig. 2 B). The Ca2+ response of the ryanodine-unmodified channel in the presence of Mg2+could be described by an EC50 of 100 µm and a Hill coefficient of 2 for Ca2+ activation, and an IC50 of 6 mm and a Hill coefficient of 2 for Ca2+ inactivation (Fig. 2 C). These data demonstrate that ryanodine is able to enhance the sensitivity of single RyR2 channels to Ca2+ activation by ∼1,000-fold (Fig.2 C). In the absence of Mg2+, the EC50 for Ca2+ activation of single wt RyR2 channels is ∼ 0.3 µm (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on the above estimation of the extent of ryanodine activation, single wt RyR2 channels upon modification by ryanodine would be expected to be active at subnanomolar Ca2+ concentrations in the absence of Mg2+. As shown in Fig. 3, the ryanodine-modified single wt RyR2 channels in the absence of Mg2+ were extremely sensitive to Ca2+ activation. Significant channel activity could still be detected even when the Ca2+concentration was reduced to as low as ∼0.3 nm (Fig. 3,A and C). Some channels remained fully active at a Ca2+ concentration less than 1 nm (Fig. 3,B and C). These residual activities, however, could be abolished by a subsequent addition of 2 mmMg2+ (Fig. 2). Thus, together, these observations indicate that ryanodine dramatically increases the Po of the RyR channel by sensitizing the channel to Ca2+activation. To demonstrate further the sensitizing effect of ryanodine on Ca2+ activation, we utilized a Ca2+-sensing-deficient mutant of RyR2. We have shown previously that a single point mutation E3987A reduced the sensitivity to Ca2+ activation of single RyR2 channels by ∼1,000-fold, as measured by single-channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We reasoned that, if ryanodine is able to enhance the sensitivity of the wt RyR2 channel to Ca2+ activation by ∼1,000-fold, ryanodine would be able to restore Ca2+activation of the E3987A mutant RyR2 channel to a level similar to that of the wt. To this end, we examined the Ca2+ dependence of single E3987A mutant RyR2 channels after being modified by ryanodine. As shown in Fig. 4, upon modification by ryanodine, a single E3987A mutant RyR2 channel was converted to a state with a reduced single-channel conductance and a markedly increasedPo, as were observed with the wt channel (Fig.1) (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the ryanodine-modified single E3987A mutant channels never open to the ryanodine-unmodified full conductance level. In addition, different from the ryanodine-unmodified mutant channels, the ryanodine-modified single E3987A mutant channel was highly sensitive to Ca2+ activation. The Ca2+ dependence of some ryanodine-modified single E3987A mutant channels could be characterized by an EC50 of 0.42 µm and a Hill coefficient of 3.1. These values are very similar to those of single wt RyR2 channels in the absence of ryanodine (EC50 = 0.26 µm, Hill coefficient = 3.1) (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Hence, ryanodine is able to restore Ca2+ activation of the E3987A mutant RyR2 channels. Furthermore, like that observed with the ryanodine-modified wt RyR2 channels, some ryanodine-modified E3987A mutant channels remained highly active even at ∼100 nm Ca2+ (Fig. 4 f). These residual activities, however, could be abolished by subsequent addition of Mg2+ (see below). These observations indicate that, upon ryanodine modification, the sensitivities to Ca2+activation of both the wt and E3987A mutant RyR2 channels were enhanced dramatically. It is apparent from Fig. 4 that the ryanodine-restored E3987A mutant channels behaved like the wt channel with respect to Ca2+-dependent activation. To investigate whether ryanodine-restored single E3987A mutant channels also respond to channel modulators in a similar fashion as does the wt, we determined the effect of Mg2+ on the Ca2+dependence of the restored mutant channels. As shown in Fig.5, in the presence of 2 mmMg2+, ryanodine-restored single E3987A mutant channels were fully activated at ∼400 µm Ca2+ and were inhibited at micromolar levels (Fig. 5, a–d). It should be noted that the ryanodine-unmodified single E3987A mutant channels exhibited little activity in the presence of 2 mmMg2+ (data not shown). Analysis of the Ca2+dependence reveals that the EC50 and the Hill coefficient values (115 µm and 2.1) of the ryanodine-restored single E3987A mutant channels are very similar to those of the ryanodine-unmodified wt channels (100 µm and 2.0) in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ (Figs. 2 and 5). Thus, the ryanodine-restored single E3987A mutant channels exhibit Ca2+ and Mg2+ responses similar to those of the ryanodine-unmodified wt channels. In other words, ryanodine rescues the Ca2+ and Mg2+ responses of the E3987A mutant RyR2 channel. Comparison of the EC50 values of the ryanodine-modified wt and ryanodine-restored E3987A mutant channels in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ (Figs. 2 and 5) also reveals that the relative sensitivities of single E3987A mutant and wt RyR2 channels differ by ∼1,000-fold. This estimated difference is in agreement with that estimated previously by single-channel recordings in the absence of ryanodine but in the presence of ATP and caffeine. The ryanodine-restored E3987A mutant channels were also sensitive to caffeine. The Ca2+ dependence of the Mg2+inhibited, ryanodine-restored E3987A mutant channels was shifted by 2 mm caffeine to the left by ∼100-fold, from 115 µm to ∼1 µm (Fig.6A). Note that the ryanodine-unmodified E3987A mutant channels in the presence of 2 mm caffeine and 2 mm Mg2+ showed minimal Ca2+-activated activities (Fig. 6 B). Hence, ryanodine is able to restore the ligand response of single E3987A mutant channels. It is clear that ryanodine is able to restore the function and regulation of single E3987A mutant channels in lipid bilayers. To examine whether ryanodine is able to restore function of the E3987A mutant in the cell context, we pretreated HEK293 cells expressing the wt and E3987A mutant RyR2 channels with or without 500 µm ryanodine and determined caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in these cells. Pretreatment of wt RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells with ryanodine abolished caffeine-induced Ca2+ release (Fig.7, a and b), whereas pretreatment with ryanodine of E3987A mutant-expressing HEK293 cells converted the mutant channel from caffeine-insensitive to caffeine-sensitive (Fig. 7, c and d). We have also examined the effect of ryanodine pretreatment on the caffeine response of HEK293 cells expressing the wt RyR3 and the corresponding Ca2+-sensing mutant E3885A in RyR3. Similarly, ryanodine pretreatment restored the caffeine response of the E3885A mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 7, g and h), but abolished that of the wt RyR3-expressing cells (Fig. 7, eand f). Therefore, ryanodine is able to restore the activities of the Ca2+-sensing mutants of RyR2 and of RyR3 in the context of HEK293 cells. High concentrations of ryanodine are known to block the RyR channel completely by binding to the low affinity binding site. However, 500 µm ryanodine did not appear to block completely the Ca2+-sensing mutants of RyR2 or RyR3 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 7). These observations raise a question of whether the E3987A mutant RyR2 channel is sensitive to blockade by high concentrations of ryanodine. To address this question, we investigated the effect of high concentrations of ryanodine on the activity of single E3987A mutant channels incorporated into lipid bilayers. Fig. 8shows that a single E3987A mutant channel activated by 400 µmCa2+ and 2 mm caffeine was modified by 500 µm ryanodine into a reduced subconductance state with increased Po. Shortly after modification (within 10–120 s), the ryanodine-modified E3987A mutant channel was blocked completely and irreversibly (n = 6). These data indicate that single E3987A mutant channels are sensitive to block or occlusion by ryanodine at high concentrations. It has been shown also that binding of ryanodine to the low affinity binding site can slow down the dissociation of bound [3H]ryanodine from the high affinity binding site (19Wang J.P. Needleman D.H. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20974-20982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20McGrew S.G. Wolleben C. Siegl P. Inui M. Fleischer S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that the E3987A mutant RyR2 protein is capable of binding [3H]ryanodine with binding affinity identical to that of the wt RyR2 (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To demonstrate further that the E3987A mutant channels also contain the low affinity ryanodine binding site, we examined the effect of excess unlabeled ryanodine on the dissociation of bound [3H]ryanodine. Fig.9shows that in the absence of unlabeled ryanodine, [3H]ryanodine bound to wt and E3987A mutant RyR2 proteins dissociated with an initial dissociation rate constant (k off) of 0.011 ± 0.0011 min−1(n = 4) and 0.016 ± 0.0012 min−1(n = 3), respectively. Addition of 200 µmunlabeled ryanodine slowed down the dissociation of bound [3H]ryanodine from both the wt and E3987A mutant RyR2 channels substantially. The k off values for the wt and E3987A mutant RyR2 channels in the presence of 200 µm ryanodine were decreased to 0.0012 ± 0.0001 min−1 (n = 3) and 0.0024 ± 0.0003 min−1 (n = 3), respectively. Taken together, these data indicate that the E3987A mutant RyR2 channel, like the wt, possesses both the high and low affinity ryanodine binding sites. It is generally believed that, upon binding, ryanodine locks the RyR channel into an open state, and that the ryanodine-modified RyR is insensitive to modulation (5Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 11Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These views, however, have not been examined in detail and have recently been questioned (25Tanna B. Welch W. Ruest L. Sutko J.L. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that ryanodine is able to increase the sensitivity of single wt RyR2 channels to Ca2+ activation by ∼1,000-fold. In addition, we show that ryanodine is able to restore Ca2+ response of the Ca2+-sensing-deficient mutant E3987A, which has been shown to exhibit ∼1,000-fold reduction in Ca2+ sensitivity. Furthermore, both the ryanodine-modified wt and ryanodine-modified E3987A mutant RyR2 channels are sensitive to modulation by channel modulators such as Mg2+ and caffeine. These results provide direct evidence that ryanodine does not lock the RyR channel into an open state; rather, it enhances dramatically the channel activity by sensitizing the channel to Ca2+ activation. Our results also reveal that Ca2+ activation and ryanodine binding are functionally coupled. Although Ca2+ activation has been shown to influence ryanodine binding to the RyR channel (29Pessah I.N. Stambuk R.A. Casida J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 232-238PubMed Google Scholar,30Chu A. Diaz-Munoz M. Hawkes M.J. Brush K. Hamilton S.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar), our present study shows that ryanodine binding to the channel can in turn influence Ca2+ activation. The molecular basis underlying this functional coupling, however, has yet to be understood. Since ryanodine binds to the open state of the channel, it is possible that ryanodine could enhance Ca2+ activation by stabilizing the open state or destabilizing the closed state of the channel. Alternatively, ryanodine binding may cause conformational changes that result in an increase in the affinity of the channel for activating Ca2+, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the channel to Ca2+ activation. In this regard, it is of interest to note that the ryanodine-modified wt and E3987A mutant channels were relatively insensitive to addition of EGTA, but sensitive to subsequent addition of Mg2+. It appeared that the activating Ca2+ ions dissociated slowly from the activation site in the ryanodine-modified channels and were unable to be chelated completely by EGTA, but could be readily replaced by Mg2+. One possible explanation for these observations is that the activating Ca2+ ions may have been partially occluded in the Ca2+ activation site in the ryanodine-modified channels. Information on the locations of the ryanodine binding and Ca2+ activation sites may provide some insights into the coupling mechanism between ryanodine binding and Ca2+activation. Both the high and low affinity ryanodine binding sites have been localized to a 75-kDa COOH-terminal fragment, starting at arginine 4475, of RyR (31Witcher D.R. McPherson P.S. Kahl S.D. Lewis T.

Cantu III, C. Wu Y. Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that mutations in the proposed pore-forming segment (4820–4829) in RyR2 impaired or abolished [3H]ryanodine binding, but retained caffeine-sensitive channel activity (33Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting that the pore-forming segment is the major determinant of ryanodine binding. We have shown also that mutation E3987A dramatically reduces the Ca2+ sensitivity to activation of RyR2, but does not affect ryanodine binding to either the high or low affinity site (26Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (Fig.8). These observations indicate that glutamate 3987 is not involved in ryanodine binding, and that the sites for ryanodine binding and Ca2+ activation are distinct. Hence, ryanodine most likely affects Ca2+ activation through an allosteric mechanism. However, such a mechanism does not exclude the possibility that the ryanodine binding and Ca2+ activation sites, although separate, are located in close proximity in the three-dimensional structure of RyR. It would be of great interest to map the ryanodine binding and Ca2+ activation domains onto the three-dimensional structure of RyR. Recent localization of the amino terminus of recombinant RyR3 onto its three-dimensional structure may make such domain mapping possible (34Liu Z. Zhang J. Sharma M.R. Li P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6104-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our observation that ryanodine is able to restore the Ca2+and other ligand responses of the RyR2 Ca2+-sensing mutant, E3987A, is in line with the results of a recent study of the corresponding mutant, E4032A, in RyR1 (35Fessenden J.D. Chen L. Wang Y. Paolini C. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2865-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was shown that the corresponding mutation E4032A severely diminished the responsiveness of RyR1 to stimulation by depolarization, caffeine, and Ca2+. Treatment with ryanodine restored the responsiveness of the E4032A mutant RyR1 to these stimuli. Although the observations as a whole are consistent, some potential inconsistencies exist between our study and that by Fessenden et al. One inconsistency is concerned with the single-channel conductance of the ryanodine-modified mutant channels. It was stated that some ryanodine-pretreated single E4032A mutant RyR1 channels exhibited frequent gating transitions to the fully open state having single-channel conductance similar to that of the ryanodine-untreated wt RyR1 channels (35Fessenden J.D. Chen L. Wang Y. Paolini C. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2865-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, in our study, we have never observed gating transitions to the fully open state of the wt in the ryanodine-modified E3987A mutant RyR2 channels. In all cases, upon modification by ryanodine, single-channel conductances of both the wt and E3987A mutant RyR2 channels were reduced and the resulting modified channels gate between the closed and subconductance states. The reason for this potential discrepancy is not clear. It is possible that the corresponding mutation may have differential effects on RyR1 and RyR2 isoforms. Another potential discrepancy lies in the sensitivities of the E4032A mutant RyR1 and the E3987A mutant RyR2 to blockade by high concentrations of ryanodine. The observation that treatment of E4032A-expressing cells with 500 µm ryanodine did not affect their response to stimuli led Fessenden et al. to conclude that the E4032A mutant RyR1 channel is insensitive to blockade by high concentrations of ryanodine. We also have observed that treatment of the E3987A mutant RyR2-expressing cells with 500 µm ryanodine restored the caffeine response (Fig. 7). However, single-channel and [3H]ryanodine binding studies clearly indicate that the E3987A mutant RyR2 channel is sensitive to irreversible block by high concentrations of ryanodine, and that the E3987A mutant channel possesses both the high and low affinity ryanodine binding sites and responds to ryanodine in a manner identical to that of the wt (Figs. 8 and 9). Hence, lack of complete blockade of RyR channel activities by high concentrations of ryanodine in intact cells may not necessarily indicate that the channel is insensitive to ryanodine block. It is not clear whether single E4032A mutant RyR1 channels in lipid bilayers could be modified by ryanodine and be blocked by high concentrations of ryanodine. It is of interest to know that treatment of wt RyR1-expressing cells with 40 mm caffeine plus 500 µm ryanodine resulted in a long-lasting Ca2+ transient (35Fessenden J.D. Chen L. Wang Y. Paolini C. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2865-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). If ryanodine at 500 µm were able to block completely the wt RyR1 channel, one would expect a short-lived Ca2+transient. This observation thus suggests that, under these conditions, 500 µm ryanodine was unable to block completely the wt RyR1 channel in intact cells, although it has been shown from single-channel studies in lipid bilayers that the wt RyR1 channel can be blocked completely by high concentrations of ryanodine (11Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The reasons for the apparent lack of complete inhibition of the E4032A mutant RyR1 or E3987A mutant RyR2 channels in intact cells by high concentrations of ryanodine are not clear. The efficacy of blockade by high concentrations of ryanodine in intact cells might be different from that in lipid bilayers. Although ryanodine sensitizes both the wt and E3987A mutant RyR2 channels to Ca2+ activation, the outcomes of ryanodine treatment on wt and E3987A mutant RyR2-expressing cells could be dramatically different. In the case of E3987A mutant RyR2, ryanodine is able to shift the Ca2+ sensitivity of the mutant channel to a level comparable to that of the wt, and thus rescues the ligand response of the mutant-expressing cells. On the other hand, the ryanodine-modified wt RyR2 channel has extremely high sensitivity to Ca2+ activation. At the resting Ca2+concentrations, the ryanodine-modified wt RyR2 channel would be fully activated and thus become unresponsive to further stimulation by caffeine. Hence, the dramatically different outcomes observed with the wt and E3987A mutant RyR2-expressing cells with or without ryanodine treatment are most likely to be the consequence of their marked differences in Ca2+ sensitivity to activation, rather than the result of differential actions of ryanodine on the wt and E3987A mutant RyR2 channels. In summary, we have demonstrated that ryanodine sensitizes the RyR channel to Ca2+ activation and that ryanodine-modified channel is regulatable. Further localization of the Ca2+activation and ryanodine binding sites in the linear sequence and on the three-dimensional structure of RyR should lead to a better understanding of the functional coupling between Ca2+activation and ryanodine binding. Since ryanodine does not irreversibly activate the RyR, as thought previously, ryanodine or ryanodine analogues could be used as specific activators of the RyR channel. In particular, ryanodine derivatives that have fast unbinding rate and are less potent in Ca2+ sensitization would be useful therapeutic agents for manipulating Ca2+ release. We thank Dr. Wayne R.

In molecular mimicry, however, the specificity is obviously violated by completely unrelated molecules exhibiting functional equivalence. The functional mimicry involving unrelated molecules is often used as an effective control during various regulatory mechanisms (1Chavali G.B. Nagpal S. Majumdar S.S. Singh O. Salunke D.M. J. Mol.

The mannose-containing carbohydrates on the cell surface have been characterized to be the specific ligands of ConA (14Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). In addition to the carbohydrate ligands, ConA was also shown to bind a number of peptides sharing a common sequence motif Tyr-Pro-Tyr derived from phage display library (15Oldenberg K.R. Lognathan D.

These peptides exhibit structural as well as functional mimicry of sugars but were found to bind at a site adjacent to the well characterized monosaccharide-binding site on ConA (10Kaur K.J.

The conserved Tyr-Pro-Tyr region of the peptides shares excellent similarity with the trimannose moiety in terms of structural superimposition and their surface hydrophobicity profiles. Both the peptide and the trimannose moiety showed similarity in the energetics of binding when docked into the reciprocal sites on ConA (12Jain D. Kaur K.J. Goel M. Salunke D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently ConA and a few other lectins were shown to bind to certain porphyrin derivatives (17Bhanu K. Komath S.S. Maiya B.G. Swamy M.J. Curr. Sci. 1997; 73: 598-602Google Scholar, 18Komath S.S. Kenoth R. Giribabu L. Maiya B.G. Swamy M.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol.

The prominent hydrophobic character of the porphyrin molecules had been invoked to explain their binding to these lectins, including ConA. In the present study, meso-tetrasulfonatophenylporphyrin (H2TPPS), which binds to ConA with an association constant (Ka) of 1.22 × 104m−1, was co-crystallized with this lectin, and the structure of the complex was determined by x-ray crystallography. H2TPPS is a free base porphyrin having four aryl side groups attached to a closed tetrapyrrole ring known as the porphine core. Each aryl side group bears a sulfonate group at thepara position. It was observed that the porphyrin binds to the monosaccharide-binding site on ConA mimicking the interactions of the monosaccharide moiety. The porphyrin, being a symmetric molecule, also shows multivalency in terms of concanavalin A binding and results in cross-linking similar to that observed in the agglutination of cells. Thus, we demonstrate here that two completely unrelated molecules, obviously having independent chemical properties, bind at a common site on a receptor and exhibit similar functions. 8 mg/ml ConA (Sigma) was cocrystallized with H2TPPS (Alfa Inorganics) using the hanging drop method. The reservoir solution contained 1.25 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.75 m NaCl, and 1 mm Mn2+ and 1 mmCa2+ ions in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4). The crystals appeared after about 3 weeks. The x-ray intensity data were collected on an image plate detector (Marresearch, Norderstedt, Germany) installed on a rotating anode x-ray source (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 40 kV and 70 mA (CuKα radiation). The crystal to detector distance was 110 mm, and 1° oscillation frames were recorded. The diffraction data were collected from a single crystal and processed using the DENZO (20Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP 4 Weekend: Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar) suite of programs and subsequently scaled using SCALEPACK. Molecular replacement calculations were carried out using the program AMoRe (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The monomer of the ConA with Ca2+ and Zn2+ ions (PDB code 1ENR) was used as a model for rotation/translation function calculation between 8 and 4 Å resolution, which gave a correlation coefficient of 73.6% and an R-factor of 28.6%. The model was subjected to refinement using CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

The Fo − Fc map made after rigid body refinement showed excellent electron density for the porphyrin ligand. Conjugate gradient minimization and restrained individual B factor refinement were carried out. Water molecules were picked up using the Fo −Fc map with an electron density cut-off of 3 ς.

Since only one sulfonatophenyl group of the porphyrin was involved in the interactions with ConA, only that group was used for calculating the buried surface area. The interaction energies were calculated using the whole porphyrin as ligand for ConA monomer. Porphyrin in association with two water molecules, namely W-7 and W-12, mimics the monosaccharide. To quantitate the role of these two water molecules in monosaccharide-porphyrin mimicry, the buried surface area and interaction energies were also calculated considering the water molecules as part of porphyrin ligand. In both the calculations, the invariant water molecules between the ConA-monosaccharide and ConA-porphyrin structures were considered part of ConA (W-56 and W-15, respectively). The surface area and energy calculations were performed using the HOMOLOGY and DOCKING modules of the MSI Software (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The molecular packing in the unit cell of ConA·porphyrin complex is shown as viewed along the a (Fig.1A) and b (Fig.1B) axes, respectively. All four ConA monomers interacting with a pair of stacked porphyrins are a part of different tetramers. This leads to the cross-linking of ConA by porphyrin molecules through the noncovalent interactions (Fig. 1) similar to those observed in the complexes of biantennary oligosaccharides with different lectins (26Olsen L.R.

The cross-linking of any lectin with a ligand other than carbohydrates or glycopeptides has been observed for the first time in this crystal structure. If porphine is considered as a cell surface and the protruding sulfonatophenyl groups as the sugar moieties perched on it, then the interaction of H2TPPS with ConA in crystals mimics the cross-linking of cells by ConA, resulting in their agglutination. The H2TPPS molecule could be unambiguously defined in the difference electron density map as shown in Fig.2A. The porphyrin molecule is located on a crystallographic 2-fold axis occupying a special position. Thus, only one-half of the H2TPPS molecule, consisting of one full pyrrole ring with the halves of two other pyrrole rings that are adjacent to it and two sulfonatophenyl side groups, is part of the asymmetric unit. The phenyl rings of H2TPPS are not coplanar with the pyrrole rings of the porphine core as seen from Fig.2B. The rotation of the phenyl rings with respect to the plane of the porphine ring is evident in the electron density map (Fig.2A). The asymmetric unit of the crystals of ConA·H2TPPS complex also contains a monomer of ConA comprising of 237 residues and two metal ions (Mn2+ and Ca2+). It is evident that the binding of porphyrin does not affect the structure of ConA. One H2TPPS molecule interacts with two monomers of ConA via two of its side groups (Fig. 3). In other words, the two stacked H2TPPS molecules interact with four ConA monomers such that ConA molecules surround them on all sides. The other two side groups do not show equivalent interactions with ConA. The symmetry-related porphyrin molecules stack over each other in a slightly staggered fashion (about 27°) to prevent steric clashes between the side groups. The pair of stacked porphine macrocycles maintains a distance of about 3.6 Å with respect to each other. The porphyrins are well known to have an inherent propensity to undergo π-π stacking (23Huang X. Nakanishi K. Berova N. Chirality. 2000; 12: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, the self-stacking arrangement has not been observed in any of the crystal structures of proteins containing porphyrins. The closest examples of such stacking seen in porphyrins could be the 18 overlapping Bchl a molecules forming a complete ring in the light-harvesting complex fromRhodopseudomonas acidophila (24McDermott G. Prince S.M. Freer A.A. Hawthornwaite-Lawless A.M. Papiz M.Z. Cogdell R.J. Isaacs N.W.

Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2445-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither of these stacking arrangements appears to be as extensive and exclusive as observed in the present crystal structure. Porphyrin interacts with only six amino acid residues of each monomer of ConA (Fig. 3). The porphine core shows no direct contacts with ConA in the crystal structure of H2TPPS·ConA complex unlike in the case of porphyrins bound to other proteins. The only exception, however, is the hydrogen bond involving nitrogen of one of the pyrrole rings (N4B) with a water molecule, W-5. Furthermore, this water molecule forms a hydrogen bond with W-29 that, in turn, interacts with Tyr-12 of ConA. The core porphine moiety contributes to binding predominantly through hydrophobic interactions in other protein·porphyrin complexes (32Rosemberg F.E. Santarsiero B.D. Spiller B. Yin J. Barnes D. Schultz P.G. Stevens R.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14404-14409Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Apart from binding to proteins, porphyrins are also known to bind to DNA primarily by intercalation (33Lipscomb L.A. Zhou F.X. Presnell S.R. Woo R.J. Peek M.E. Plaskon R.R. Williams L.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2818-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, the nature of interactions in the present case is unique in the sense that the porphine core provides only a support base for specific interactions involving the sulfonatophenyl groups. The sulfonate group attached at the end of the phenyl ring of H2TPPS occupies the known monosaccharide-binding site on ConA (Fig. 4A). The oxygen atoms of this sulfonate group are involved in water-mediated and direct hydrogen bonding interactions with ConA (Fig. 4B). The direct hydrogen bonding of porphyrin with ConA is through O-13 of the porphyrin and backbone amide of Arg-228 of ConA. Another hydrogen bond is mediated by W-15 bridging Thr-226:OG1 of ConA and O-11 of porphyrin. Similarly W-12, which is also networked with W-7, forms a bridge between O-13 of porphyrin and the side chains of Asp-208 and Asn-14. The role of water-mediated interactions in cementing the empty spaces between the receptor and the ligand has long been appreciated (34Braden B.C. Poljak R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 35Mariuzza R.A. Poljak R.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate-binding proteins modulate their substrate specificity and affinity with the help of bound water molecules (36Bourne Y. Rouge P. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18161-18165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Quiocho F.A. Wilson D.K. Vyas N.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 38Ravishankar R. Ravindran M. Saguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Curr. Sci. 1997; 72: 855-861Google Scholar). The multiple ligand specificity of periplasmic lysine-, arginine- and ornithine-binding protein for various amino acids is also optimized by relocation of protein-bound water molecules (39Oh B. Ames G.F. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26323-26330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations corroborate the role of water in defining the mode of interaction of H2TPPS in its binding to ConA. The ConA-porphyrin and ConA-sugar crystal structures were superimposed in the ligand-binding region (Fig. 4A). It was observed that H2TPPS shows only partial complementarity with the binding site. On the other hand, the mannopyranoside shows a much more snug fit within the binding site on ConA. However, in the interaction of H2TPPS, the water-mediated hydrogen bonds create a network similar to that observed in the case of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside binding to ConA. The interaction of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside with ConA involves eight hydrogen bonds. The binding of the sulfonatophenyl group of porphyrin mimics seven among them. The geometrical relationship of the hydrogen bonding networks of the porphyrin·ConA and monosaccharide·ConA complexes is depicted in Fig. 4B. The hydrogen bonds involving the O-4 atom of the sugar are in this case taken over by the water, W-12. Similarly the interactions of the O-6 atom of the sugar are replaced by another water molecule, W-7. These two water molecules together account for five hydrogen bonds. The O-13 of porphyrin takes over the hydrogen bonding function of O-3 of the sugar ligand. The hydrogen bond of O-11 of the porphyrin to residue Thr-226 of ConA through W-15 corresponds to the hydrogen bond in the case of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside·ConA complex, where a water molecule (W-56 in 5CNA) bridges the hydrogen bond between O-2 of the sugar and residue 226 of ConA. Thus, O-11 of H2TPPS acts as the mimicking counterpart of the O-2 atom of the monosaccharide. The hydrogen bond involving O-5 of the sugar and the backbone amide of Leu-99 of ConA is the only interaction, which does not have a counterpart in the ConA·H2TPPS complex. The equivalence of the hydrogen bonds in the ConA-sugar structure and the ConA-H2TPPS structure is described in TableII. The porphyrin·ConA complex also takes advantage of the external bound water W-15 in a fashion similar to the binding of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside to ConA where W-15 has a counterpart in W-56. Similarity of hydrogen bonding has been suggested to be involved in molecular mimicry in the case of anti-hen egg white lysozyme antibody (D1.3) complexed with an anti-idiotypic antibody and lysozyme binding to D1.3. However, only 6 of 14 protein-protein hydrogen bonds are conserved in this case (40Braden B.C. Fields B.A. Ysern X. Dall'Acqua W. Goldbaum F.A. Poljak R.J. Mariuzza R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mimicry between a trimannose moiety and a peptide ligand of ConA is predominantly modulated by hydrophobic features (12Jain D. Kaur K.J. Goel M. Salunke D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The present case is particularly interesting because almost all the hydrogen bonds, except one, are being mimicked by the porphyrin.Table IIEquivalence of hydrogen bonds seen in monosaccharide·ConA and porphyrin·ConA complexesDistanceSugarWater2-aBound waters in monosaccharide·ConA complex (5CNA).ConAWater2-bBound waters in porphyrin·ConA complex.PorphyrinDistanceÅÅ3.03O-5Leu-99:N2.82W-562-cW corresponds to the bound water molecule.Thr-226:OG1W-152.652.72O-2W-56W-15O-112.662.88O-3Arg-228:NO-132.822.63O-4Asp-208:OD2W-122.662.99O-4Asn-14:ND2W-123.092.88O-6Asp-208:OD1W-72.842.97O-6Tyr-100:NW-72.943.06O-6Leu-99:NW-73.132-a Bound waters in monosaccharide·ConA complex (5CNA).2-b Bound waters in porphyrin·ConA complex.2-c W corresponds to the bound water molecule. Open table in a new tab The surface areas of the ligand and the receptor that become inaccessible to solvent on binding and the intermolecular interaction energies are expected to be similar when the two different ligands behave as mimics of the same receptor. The buried surface area of porphyrin ligand increases from 137.9 to 224.4 Å2 in the presence of W-7 and W-12 and is closer to the buried surface area of monosaccharide ligand, which is 228.7 Å2. The buried surface area of ConA, however, does not show any substantial difference, increasing from 102.2 to 125.9 Å2 on inclusion of water molecules and being intermediate (119.5 Å2) in the case of monosaccharide ligand. The incorporation of the two water molecules as part of the porphyrin ligand increases the strength of interaction in terms of total energy from −22.6 to −48.8 kcal/mol. The total energy of interaction of the monosaccharide ligand is about −34.3 kcal/mol. The major contribution of the water molecules is to the electrostatic energy, which increases from −0.6 to −24.9 kcal/mol in their presence. The van der Waals interaction energy is very similar in all cases, −21.1 kcal/mol for monosaccharide, −22.0 kcal/mol for porphyrin, and −23.9 kcal/mol for porphyrin in the presence of water molecules. Thus, it appears that the complementarity of porphyrin binding to ConA, in terms of buried surface area and interaction energy, enhances on incorporation of two bound water molecules. In conclusion, the accommodation of different but related ligands at the common receptor-binding site using the extraordinary cementing ability of water molecules has often been observed (38Ravishankar R. Ravindran M. Saguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Curr. Sci. 1997; 72: 855-861Google Scholar, 39Oh B. Ames G.F. Kim S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 291: 393-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the present study provides an attractive example of equivalence between completely unrelated ligands. It is evident that both the ligands bind to the same site on ConA using similar interactions. The binding of H2TPPS to ConA resembles that of the monosaccharide by virtue of it being able to mimic the interactions of the sugar with the help of bound water molecules. This is contrary to the sugar-mimicking peptides, which bind to ConA mimicking the hydropathy features of the carbohydrate ligands (11Jain D. Kaur K.J. Sundaravadivel B. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16098-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Jain D. Kaur K.J. Goel M. Salunke D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The symmetrical nature and multivalency of porphyrin leads to end-to-end cross-linking akin to that observed in cell-cell agglutination by ConA. Therefore, H2TPPS binding to ConA could be considered functionally equivalent to that of the natural carbohydrate ligands of ConA. The similarity of sugar and porphyrin observed here has direct implications to the structural basis of molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry is understood and interpreted in many diverse ways. It covers an entire gamut of quasi-equivalences from sequence similarity in proteins to the similarity as seen by the immune response to chemically different ligands. The sulfonatophenyl group of the porphyrin and the sugar are two different ligands that do not share any obvious shape similarity yet bind at a common site on ConA through a remarkable correspondence of hydrogen bonding interactions. This is facilitated by the bound water molecules. However, it does not mean that any functional group can adopt a particular topology of specific binding through water of hydration. The incorporation of bound water molecules relates to the structural properties of the concerned molecules. In fact, the water of hydration, like flexibility as in induced fit, has often been suggested to be responsible for modulation of affinity (38Ravishankar R. Ravindran M. Saguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Curr. Sci. 1997; 72: 855-861Google Scholar, 39Oh B. Ames G.F. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26323-26330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present case, such a cementing role of water is reflected in terms of mimicry. We thank Drs. D. L. D. Caspar, Keiichi Namba, and K. V. S. Rao for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2077232948,"We have recently reported that arachidonic acid mediates β2-adrenergic receptor (AR) stimulation of [Ca2+]i cycling and cell contraction in embryonic chick ventricular cardiomyocytes (Pavoine, C., Magne, S., Sauvadet, A., and Pecker, F. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 628–637). In the present work, we demonstrate that β2-AR agonists trigger arachidonic acid release via translocation and activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and increase caffeine-releasable Ca2+ pools from Fura-2-loaded cells. We also show that β2-AR agonists trigger a rapid and dose-dependent phosphorylation of both p38 and p42/44 MAPKs. Translocation and activation of cPLA2, as well as Ca2+ accumulation in sarcoplasmic reticulum stores sensitive to caffeine and amplification of [Ca2+]i cycling in response to β2-AR agonists, were blocked by inhibitors of the p38 or p42/44 MAPK pathway (SB203580 and PD98059, respectively), suggesting a role of both MAPK subtypes in β2-AR stimulation. In contrast, β1-AR stimulation of [Ca2+]i cycling was rather limited by the MAPKs, clearly proving the divergence between β2-AR and β1-AR signaling systems. This study presents the first evidence for the coupling of β2-AR to cardiac cPLA2 and points out the key role of the MAPK pathway in the intracellular signaling elicited by positive inotropic β2-AR agonists in heart. We have recently reported that arachidonic acid mediates β2-adrenergic receptor (AR) stimulation of [Ca2+]i cycling and cell contraction in embryonic chick ventricular cardiomyocytes (Pavoine, C., Magne, S., Sauvadet, A., and Pecker, F.

Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The β2-AR-mediated signaling system plays a critical role in the regulation of cardiac performance, more particularly in the failing and aged heart, where there is selective down-regulation of β1-ARs. β2-AR agonists are mostly known as activators of adenylyl cyclase via coupling to Gs (1Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Del Monte F. Kaumann A.J. Poole-Wilson P.A. Wynne D.G. Pepper J. Harding S.E.

However, the role of cAMP in the functional response to β2-AR stimulation is controversial, and there is accumulating evidence that β2-AR agonists could modulate cardiac excitation-contraction coupling via a cAMP-independent mechanism (1Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We have recently identified an alternative pathway relaying the positive inotropic effect of β2-AR agonists in embryonic chick heart cells (5Pavoine C. Magne S. Sauvadet A. Pecker F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 628-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In these cells, stimulation of β2-ARs triggers the production of arachidonic acid (AA) via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein pathway. We also demonstrated that AA induces 45Ca2+ accumulation in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stores sensitive to caffeine, a mechanism likely to support positive inotropy (6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12437-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The β2-AR-elicited contractile effect is independent of adenylyl cyclase activation and cAMP production and totally relies on AA release. Although inhibition of the β2-AR-induced responses by AACOCF3 suggested the role of a Ca2+-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) as the effector of β2-AR, direct evidence for the coupling of β2-AR to cPLA2 activation remained to be established. Phospholipase A2 comprises a large family of enzymes that hydrolyze the sn-2-fatty acyl ester bonds of membranous phospholipids, leading to the liberation of free fatty acids including AA. PLA2 enzymes are classified according to localization (extracellular versus intracellular), sequence homology, and biochemical characteristics (7Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Extracellular PLA2enzymes, also referred as to secreted PLA2(sPLA2) enzymes, represent a growing family of enzymes with five distinct mammalian sPLA2 enzymes already identified (8Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To date, four intracellular PLA2 sequences have been reported: two Ca2+-dependent PLA2enzymes (cPLA2-α and the recently identified cPLA2-β) (9Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A.

Of particular interest is the Ca2+-dependent cPLA2-α (referred as to cPLA2 below), which plays an essential role in hormone-induced AA release (13Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.L. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) with major implications in reproductive function and inflammation, as confirmed recently by studies using cPLA2-deficient mice (14Bonventre J.V.

J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 17Huang Z. Payette P. Abdullah K. Cromlish W.A. Kennedy B.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3712-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). cPLA2 is fully activated by both phosphorylation and increases in intracellular calcium, which drive its translocation from the cytosol to membranes in a process utilizing a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding domain (C2 domain) in the N-terminal region of the enzyme. In a variety of cell types, phosphorylation of cPLA2 is achieved by p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and/or the MAPK homolog p38 (16Gijon M.A. Leslie C.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 18Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). MAPKs are a family of Ser/Thr kinases that comprises the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs or p42/44 MAPKs), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPKs (for a review, see Ref. 19Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, the ERK cascade is activated principally by G protein-coupled receptor agonists and peptide growth factors. JNKs and p38 MAPKs are stimulated by hyperosmotic shock, hypoxia/reoxygenation, reactive oxygen species, and mechanical stress, but also by G protein-coupled receptors such as endothelin-1, phenylephrine (α-AR agonist), and angiotensin II (for a review, see Ref. 20Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that all MAPKs participate in the long-term myocyte hypertrophic response triggered by endothelin-1, phenylephrine, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Thus, the literature clearly demonstrates the immense potential significance of the regulation of MAPK pathways in the myocardium with respect to its reactions to pathological stresses (e.g. hypoxia, ischemia, reperfusion injury, hypertension, and inflammatory diseases). In contrast, the participation of MAPKs in cardiac physiological intracellular signaling is poorly documented. In this study, we show that, in embryonic chick heart cells, β2-AR stimulation triggers cPLA2translocation to the membranes, AA release, Ca2+accumulation in SR stores sensitive to caffeine, and amplification of [Ca2+]i cycling. We also demonstrate that β2-AR-induced responses rely on activation of both p42/44 and p38 MAPKs. This study highlights the participation of MAPKs in the positive inotropic effect elicited by β2-AR agonists. This MAPK/cPLA2 pathway is selective for β2-AR stimulation and is not involved in β1-AR-induced responses.

Ca2+ imaging was essentially performed as described by Sauvadet et al. (6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12437-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Sauvadet A. Pecker F. Pavoine C.

Field electrical stimulation (square waves, 10-ms duration, amplitude 20% above threshold, and 0.5 Hz) was supplied through a pair of platinum electrodes connected to the output of a HAMEG stimulator. MAPK inhibitors and/or selective β-AR antagonists were added 1 h or 10 min, respectively, before application of selective β-AR agonists. To evaluate the caffeine-releasable Ca2+ pool, electrical stimulation was omitted. MAPK or PLA2 inhibitors were added 1 h or 10 min, respectively, before an additional 10-min preincubation with zinterol. Caffeine was applied a few seconds after initiation of image recordings. Embryonic chick heart cells (5 × 105 cells/ml), suspended in buffer A supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, were plated in 100-mm plates and incubated in humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. After 24 h, the culture medium was changed to serum-free buffer A; and 24 h later, cells were exposed to various agonists and/or enzymatic inhibitors diluted in buffer A and incubated for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C. Incubation was stopped by the removal of the medium, two successive washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the addition of ice-cold buffer C (40 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 200 µm Na3VO4, and 50 mmNaF)). Cells were scraped and disrupted by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles, followed by sonication. Cell sonicates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min in a Sigma Model 1k15 centrifuge at 4 °C. The 1000 ×g supernatant was submitted to a 100,000 ×g centrifugation for 40 min at 4 °C. Phospholipase A2 activity in 100,000 × gpellet and supernatant fractions was assessed by measuring the release of radiolabeled arachidonic acid from the sn-2-position of 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonylphosphatidylcholine (PC). The reaction was carried out with 30–50 µg of proteins from the 100,000 × g supernatant or pellet fraction and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a 200-µl final volume of buffer D (40 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaF, 200 µm Na3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) with or without inhibitors of iPLA2 (10 µm HELSS), sPLA2 (2 mm DTT), and/or cPLA2 (10 µmAACOCF3) and [14C]PC (2 µm, 1.5–2 × 105 cpm/assay) substrate vesicles freshly prepared as follows. [14C]PC (18–24 nmol, 4.5–6 × 106 cpm) was dried under liquid nitrogen, resuspended in 750 µl of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mmNaCl, and sonicated 3 × 5 min at 4 °C before addition to the assay medium at 25 µl. The reaction was terminated by adding 800 µl of Dole's reagent (32% isopropyl alcohol, 67% n-heptane, and 1% of 1 n H2SO4) and 0.1 mg of unlabeled arachidonic acid. After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and 400 µl of the upper phase was mixed with silicic acid (50 mg) before centrifugation at 3000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and submitted to a second separation step on silicic acid. Following centrifugation at 3000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was added to 10 ml of Ready-Solv solution, and radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Assays for cPLA2 activity were routinely performed in the presence of both HELSS and DTT. Results are expressed in disintegrations/min since specific activity in the assays depended on the unknown endogenous content of phospholipids. It should be noted that, due to the preferential hydrolysis of endogenous phospholipids compared with exogenously added radiolabeled PC, cPLA2 activity evaluated in the 100,000 × g pellet fraction was probably underestimated compared with cPLA2 activity in the 100,000 × g supernatant fraction. Embryonic chick heart cells (5 × 105 cells/ml), suspended in buffer A supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, were plated in 24-well plates, left for 24 h in humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C, and then incubated with 1.5 µCi/ml [3H]AA (6.75 nm). After 24 h, [3H]AA release was determined by stimulating prelabeled cells in medium containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and counting total radioactivity in the cell medium as previously described (5Pavoine C. Magne S. Sauvadet A. Pecker F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 628-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin served to trap the released AA (24Peters-Golden M. Song K. Marshall T. Brock T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Embryonic chick heart cells (5 × 105 cells/ml), suspended in buffer A supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, were plated in 60-mm plates and incubated in humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. After 24 h, the culture medium was changed to serum-free buffer A. 24 h later, cells were exposed to various agonists and/or enzymatic inhibitors diluted in buffer A and incubated for various periods of time at 37 °C. Incubation was terminated by the removal of the medium and the addition of ice-cold PBS. Cells were washed and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet-P40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmvanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 100 µm DTT). Cells were scraped and allowed to lyse for 1 h at 4 °C. In the first series of experiments (cPLA2 study; see Fig. 5), whole cell homogenates were used. In the second series of experiments (MAPK study; see Fig. 4), cell homogenates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples of the 20,000 × g supernatant containing 50 µg of proteins (MAPK study; see Fig. 4) or whole cell homogenates containing 100 µg of proteins (cPLA2 study; see Fig. 5) were taken, lyophilized, resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Samples were boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis.Figure 4Zinterol enhances phosphorylation of p38 and p42/44 MAPKs: dose dependence (A) and sensitivity to ICI 118551 (β2-AR antagonist) (B) of zinterol action. Embryonic chick ventricular cells were stimulated for 8 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of zinterol (A) or for 8 min with or without 30 nm zinterol in the absence or presence of 100 nm ICI 118551 (B). Cell lysates were prepared and separated (50 µg of proteins) on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against human phospho-p38 MAPK or human phospho-p42/44 MAPK as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electrophoresis was performed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (25 mA/gel). Proteins were transferred to Protran nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) by electroblotting using Tris/glycine/SDS buffer containing 20% methanol (120 mA for 1 h at 4 °C). Protein transfer was evaluated by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. Equal loading of proteins in each lane was checked by Ponceau red staining of the membrane. The nitrocellulose blots were agitated for 30 min at room temperature in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and then for 1 h in TBST supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk prior to overnight incubation with primary antibodies against phospho-MAPKs (1:2000 dilution) in TBST supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed three times with TBST, and the peroxidase activity was determined using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Electrophoresis was performed on 24-cm 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (45 mA/gel). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) microporous membrane (Millipore Corp.) by electroblotting using Tris/glycine/SDS buffer containing 20% methanol (40 V for 16 h at 4 °C). Protein transfer was evaluated by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. Equal loading of proteins in each lane was checked by Ponceau red staining of the membrane. The PVDF blots were agitated overnight at room temperature in TBST supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk and then in TBST supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk containing primary antibodies against cPLA2 (1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution) for 1.5 h at room temperature in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed three times with TBST, and the alkaline phosphatase activity was determined using the enhanced chemifluorescence Western blot detection system (ECF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). It is noteworthy that the amino acid sequence of chicken cPLA2 differs from the sequences of the human and mouse enzymes by 20–30% and that immunochemical detection of chicken cPLA2 is rather difficult due to the lack of antibodies specifically raised against the chicken enzyme. Following cPLA2 detection, MAPK phosphorylation was evaluated on the same PVDF blots, which had been treated for 30 min in 100% methanol and washed three times with TBST to remove the ECF reaction precipitate. PVDF blots were incubated in stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.4 mm Tris (pH 6.7)) for 45 min at 50 °C with agitation and washed twice with TBST at room temperature. After 24 h at room temperature in TBST supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk, PVDF blots were incubated overnight with primary antibodies against phospho-MAPKs (1:2000 dilution) in TBST supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution) for 1.5 h at room temperature in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed three times with TBST, and the alkaline phosphatase activity was determined using the ECF Western blot detection system. This study shows that, in embryonic chick heart cells, cPLA2 translocation to membranes can occur at 37 °C in response to supraphysiological elevation of [Ca2+]i or at basal [Ca2+]ifollowing MAPK activation (see “Results” and “Discussion”). In the experimental procedures, cell incubations were terminated by the addition of ice-cold Ca2+-free lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors. It should be noted that the inclusion of 2 mm Ca2+ (no added EGTA) or its absence (2 mm EGTA added) in the ice-cold lysis buffer did not affect cPLA2 recovery in the 100,000 × gfractions when analyzed by Western blotting. This suggested that (i) there is a stable binding of cPLA2 to membranes that is not readily reversed by chelating Ca2+ at 4 °C in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, and (ii) inclusion of Ca2+ in the ice-cold lysis buffer did not promote an artificial redistribution of the cytosolic enzyme toward the membranes. Embryonic chick heart cells (3 × 105 cells/ml), suspended in buffer A supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, were plated on plastic chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Nunc) coated with laminin (1 µg/ml) and incubated in humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. After 24 h, the culture medium was changed to serum-free buffer A. After a 1-h pretreatment with or without MAPK inhibitors and/or a 10-min preincubation with or without selective β-AR antagonists, cells were incubated for the indicated periods of time with or without selective β-AR agonists. Cells were washed twice briefly with PBS and allowed to dry. Cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in acetone, washed with PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 and PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After three brief washes, blocking was performed in PBS containing 10% sheep serum for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with anti-cPLA2 antibody (1:250 dilution) overnight at 4 °C and washed three times for 5 min with PBS at room temperature. Incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:500 dilution) was then performed for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were washed 3 × 10 min with PBS and rinsed for 5 min with water. 10 µl of Vectashield mounting medium was applied to the cell surface, and coverslips were mounted. Controls were carried out by replacing the primary antibody with PBS. Slides were viewed by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axoplan microscope (magnification × 630). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. ofn experiments and were analyzed by unpaired Student'st test, one-way analysis of variance, or non-parametric analysis of variance, as appropriate, with p < 0.05 considered to be significant. We measured PLA2 activities in the 100,000 × gfractions prepared from embryonic chick ventricular cells. We used the preferential substrate of cPLA2, 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonylphosphatidylcholine, in the absence or presence of specific inhibitors of the different PLA2 isoforms, viz. DTT, HELSS, and AACOCF3, to block the sPLA2, iPLA2, and cPLA2 activities, respectively. In the absence of inhibitors, total PLA2 activity in the 100,000 ×g supernatant fraction was 4–7 times higher than in the 100,000 × g pellet fraction. Thus, we used the 100,000 × g supernatant fraction to determine optimal conditions for the measurement of the AACOCF3-sensitive PLA2 activity (cPLA2). As shown in Fig.1A, in the absence of inhibitors, the AACOCF3-sensitive PLA2 activity (cPLA2) represented 73% of the total PLA2activity. The addition of the sPLA2 inhibitor DTT st"

For instance, PS1 binds to β-catenin and modulates β-catenin signaling. In the current study, we observed that knockout of PS1 inhibited β-catenin-mediated transcription by 35%, as shown by a luciferase reporter driven by the hTcf-4 promoter. Overexpressing wild-type PS1 increased β-catenin-mediated transcription by 37.5%, and overexpressing PS1 with mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease decreased β-catenin-mediated transcription by 66%. To examine whether regulation of β-catenin by PS1 requires phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK 3β), we examined whether inhibiting GSK 3β activity overcomes the inhibition of β-catenin transcription induced by mutant PS1 constructs. Cells expressing wild-type or mutant PS1 were treated with LiCl, which inhibits GSK 3β, or transfected with β-catenin constructs that lack the GSK 3β phosphorylation sites. Neither treatment overcame PS1-mediated inhibition of β-catenin signaling, suggesting that regulation of β-catenin by PS1 was not affected by the activity of GSK 3β. To investigate how PS1 might regulate β-catenin signaling, we determined whether PS1 interacts with other elements of the β-catenin signaling cascade, such as the Tcf-4 transcription factor. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed binding of PS1 and hTcf-4, and examining nuclear isolates indicated that nuclear hTcf-4 was decreased in cells expressing mutant PS1. These data show that PS1 interacts with multiple components of the β-catenin signaling cascade and suggest that PS1 regulates β-catenin in a manner independent of GSK 3β activity.

The function of PS1 appears to extend beyond that of proteolysis. PS1 regulates β-catenin signaling through a mechanism that is speculated to require phosphorylation by GSK 3β, and subsequent degradation (14Murayama M. Tanaka S. Palacino J. Murayama O. Honda T.

However, this mechanism has yet to be tested. β-Catenin is a member of a class of arm repeat proteins that have been associated with cell-cell contact. It has also been shown to have a secondary role as a transcriptional regulator of the Wnt signal transduction cascade. This pool of β-catenin exists in the cytosol and is normally rapidly degraded through phosphorylation by GSK 3β, leading to its subsequent degradation. Activation of the Wnt cascade results in an inactivation of GSK 3β and an accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin. This catenin is then free to bind to transcription factors from the LEF/Tcf family, translocate to the nucleus, and activate the transcription of a variety of target genes (reviewed in Ref. 16Dale T.C.

To gain insight into how PS1 regulates β-catenin, we expressed mutant forms of PS1 in N2a neuroblastoma and HEK 293 cells and examined regulation of β-catenin signaling by PS1. We now report that mutant forms of PS1 can inhibit β-catenin transcriptional activity independently of the action of GSK 3β. N2a cell lines were grown in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/OptiMEM, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, and gentamicin. HEK293 cell lines were grown in OptiMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin. PS1 knockout and wild-type fibroblasts were immortalized as described previously and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and gentamicin (13Palacino J.J.

N2a and HEK293 cells for stable transfection were generated using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies Inc.) as directed by the manufacturer. Lines were selected, and colonies were propagated using G418 or hygromycin in normal growth medium, as appropriate. Plasmids containing wild-type, A246E, and ΔE9 PS1 were cloned in pcDNA3 and were a generous gift of John Hardy (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Plasmids containing the double-aspartyl substitutions D257E/D385E and D257A/D385A were cloned in pCI-Neo. Plasmids containing the M139V and D385E substitutions were cloned in pAG3-Hygro. The pTopFlash plasmid containing a human Tcf-4 promoter coupled to a luciferase reporter was a generous gift of Hans Clevers (University Medical Center, Utrecht, Netherlands) (21Roose J. Clevers H.

The pRL-CMV luciferase plasmid was purchased from Promega. Antibodies to PS1 were generated as described previously and used as described (2Doan A. Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Slunt H.H.

Antibodies to β-catenin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and used at a concentration of 1:1000 for Western blotting. The Tcf3/4 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. and used at a concentration of 1:250 for Western blotting and a concentration of 1:100 for immunoprecipitation. MKAD3.4 antibody was used for PS1 immunoblotting (1:100) (30Takashima A. Murayama M. Murayama O. Kohno T. Honda T. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Mercken M. Yamaguchi H. Sugihara S. Wolozin B. Proc. Natl.

For whole cell protein analysis, cells were lysed in 2% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline with Sigma Chemical Co. mammalian protease inhibitor mixture P-8340 (aprotinin, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, E-64, pepstatin A, bestatin, and leupeptin). Lysates were sonicated, and total protein was determined by BCA assay (bicinchoninic acid assay, Pierce). 25 µg of total protein was mixed with Laemmli buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), loaded on 12% acrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked, exposed to primary antibody overnight, and washed, and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added for 3 h. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using Super Signal Pico ECL reagent (Pierce) and exposed to film. For analysis of nuclear localization, extracts were prepared as described previously (23Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated and allowed to grow to ∼90% confluence on 10-cm diameter cell culture dishes. Plates were then treated with 10 mm LiCl for 3 h to inhibit GSK 3β and stimulate β-catenin signaling. The plates were then chilled to 4 °C and washed three times in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were then removed from plates by mechanical scraping and collected into ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. All remaining steps were performed in a cold room. Samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 × g, the supernatant was removed, and packed cell volume was estimated. Cells were then resuspended in 5 packed cell volumes of chilled hypotonic extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm DTT) and incubated for 10 min. Following the incubation, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g and resuspended in 2 packed cell volumes of extraction buffer. Cell membranes were then ruptured with 10 strokes of an ice-cold Dounce. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was discarded, and the pelleted nuclei were lysed in 2% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. Protein content was determined by BCA assay (Pierce), and 10-µg samples were mixed with Laemmli buffer, electrophoresed, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Cells for immunoprecipitation were grown to ∼85–90% confluence on 10-cm diameter cell culture dishes (∼2 × 106 cells). Plates were chilled to 4 °C, and cells were mechanically removed by scraping. Samples were then lysed in an immunoprecipitation buffer containing 10 mmTris (pH 8.0), 0.14 m NaCl, 0.025% sodium azide, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Sigma mammalian protease inhibitor mixture P-8340 (aprotinin, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, E-64, pepstatin A, bestatin, and leupeptin). Protein complexes were solubilized by shaking on a rotating plate for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was analyzed for protein content using the BCA assay (Pierce), and 500 µg of total protein was suspended in a total volume of 500 µl. Samples were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C using Ultra-Link immobilized protein G (Pierce). Samples were then incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C with shaking. Immune complexes were then precipitated by incubation with Ultra-Link protein G for 4 h with shaking at 4 °C. Samples were then washed three times in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and examined by electrophoresis and Western blotting. Cells were transiently transfected with the pTopFlash construct described above using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) at a ratio of 2 µg of DNA:6 µl of LipofectAMINE:1 ml of OptiMEM as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated at ∼60% confluency in 24-well tissue culture clusters and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Transfections proceeded for 3.5–4 h, followed by removal of the transfection reagent and replacement with normal growth medium. For analysis of the mutant β-catenin, cells were transfected using 1.5 µg of S33V β-catenin or pcDNA3 vector, 0.5 µg of TopFlash as described above. All transfections were supplemented with 50 ng of pRL-CMV as an internal control. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Extracts were analyzed by mixing a 10-µl sample of the lysate with the Dual-Luciferase assay system as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Each sample was mixed with 100 µl of luciferase assay buffer and then read on a Turner Designs luminometer programmed to sample for 10 s following a 3-s delay. Samples were then mixed with 100 µl of the Stop And Glo buffer, which quenches the firefly luciferase signal and activates theRenilla luciferase. The samples were then re-assayed on the luminometer to determine the second signal. Data for each experiment were normalized to the pRL-CMV internal signal to control for variations in transfection efficiency. Although the samples were normalized to the pRL-CMV signal, the luciferase signal is not linear over a wide range, so the results obtained with luciferase should be viewed as semiquantitative. All assays were done in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least four times to confirm the results. Reports in the literature suggest that PS1 regulates the activity of β-catenin by regulating its stability via a GSK 3β-dependent mechanism. Based on this, we hypothesized that knockout of PS1 would remove the interaction between PS1, β-catenin, and GSK 3β. Loss of this interaction might decrease phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK 3β, leading to higher levels of free cytosolic β-catenin and increased transcriptional activity. To monitor β-catenin signaling, we measured activation of the β-catenin/hTcf-4 transcription complex. Cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct, termed pTopFlash. This construct is a β-catenin-sensitive promoter that contains four tandem repeats of the hTcf-4 DNA binding domains, which is a transcription factor thought to mediate β-catenin transcriptional signaling (24Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar, 25Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3515) Google Scholar). Previous studies show that binding of β-catenin to hTcf-4 activates transcription of the pTopFlash reporter (24Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar, 25Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3515) Google Scholar). The data was standardized by cotransfecting with a constitutively activeRenilla luciferase vector, which controls for variations in transfection efficiency. Using the pTopFlash construct, we transiently transfected immortalized fibroblasts isolated from PS1−/− mice and their wild-type littermates (13Palacino J.J. Berechid B.E. Alexander P. Eckman C. Younkin S. Nye J.S. Wolozin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 215-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, we analyzed the signal at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 days and determined that the level of signal was maximal 2 days following transfection (data not shown), hence the 2-day time point was chosen for all subsequent experiments. The data represent the mean of two experiments (n = 8). Cells lacking PS1 exhibited impaired β-catenin-mediated signaling. PS1−/− cells showed a 35 ± 4% decrease in luciferase signal (Fig. 1). The decrease in signal suggested a role for PS1 in the regulation of β-catenin-mediated transcription. Alternatively, PS1 may be active as an inhibitor of GSK 3β-mediated degradation. PS1 has been shown to bind both β-catenin and GSK 3β, but not APC, which is thought to be essential for the regulation of the phosphorylation. It is possible that PS1, by binding GSK 3β and β-catenin, but not APC, may protect free β-catenin for a short period. This protection could allow the “protected” free β-catenin additional time to activate transcription. To investigate the regulation of β-catenin signaling by PS1, we generated stably transfected N2a neuroblastoma lines overexpressing different PS1 constructs, including wild-type, A246E, Δe9, D257E/D385E, and D257A/D385A mutants. The latter two constructs each contained mutation of both aspartyl groups thought to be essential for PS1 γ-secretase function. Immunoblots of lysates from these cells showed that the aspartyl mutants were not normally cleaved and existed as a single 45-kDa holoprotein, which is consistent with observations by others (Fig. 2A). Following confirmation of PS1 overexpression, we examined the regulation of β-catenin-mediated transcription by PS1. Samples were analyzed after 48 h following transient transfection. Overexpression of wild-type PS1 showed no significant effect on the level of β-catenin-mediated transcription. Conversely, expression of the familial AD variants or aspartyl mutations of PS1 decreased the transcription by an average of 35 ± 4% (p < 0.01), depending on the construct (Fig. 2A). Data represent the mean of five individual experiments (n = 15). To exclude the possibility of clonal effects of the stable N2a lines, we repeated the experiment using a transient overexpression of PS1. For this experiment, cells were cotransfected with 1 µg of the PS1 plasmids described above and 1 µg of pTopFlash plasmid and assayed after 2 days. Analysis of β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity showed that the mutant forms of PS1 also inhibited β-catenin activity in the transient system (Fig. 2B). In fact, the inhibition was more robust in the transient overexpression paradigm producing an average inhibition of 44.8 ± 2.2% (p < 0.01) for all the mutant isoforms. The efficacy and rapidity of response in this transient experiment indicates that PS1 mutations can rapidly inhibit β-catenin-mediated transcription. The changes in β-catenin-mediated transcription could not be explained by reduction of β-catenin levels or by increased proteolysis, because immunoblotting of cell extracts from the N2a PS1 lines shows that steady-state levels of β-catenin were consistent between cell lines (data not shown). Consistent levels of total β-catenin suggest that the cellular β-catenin pool remained consistent. Reports have indicated changes in β-catenin stability following overexpression of or mutations in PS1, but the data are contradictory (15Kang D.E. Soriano S. Frosch M.P. Collins T. Naruse S.

It is possible that catenin turnover is altered, but the maintenance of a consistent steady-state protein concentration indicates that similar amounts of catenin should be available for signal transduction-related events. We wanted to examine the effect of activation of the Wnt/β-catenin cascade. To do this, we examined β-catenin-mediated transcription in HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild-type PS1, the M139V familial AD mutant, and the D385E aspartate mutant. This cell line has previously been shown to be very responsive to chemical activation of the Wnt cascade through inhibition of GSK 3β (19Nishimura M., Yu, G. Levesque G. Zhang D.M. Ruel L. Chen F. Milman P. Holmes E. Liang Y. Kawarai T. Jo E. Supala A. Rogaeva E. Xu D.M. Janus C. Levesque L. Bi Q. Duthie M. Rozmahel R. Mattila K. Lannfelt L. Westaway D. Mount H.T. Woodgett J. St. George-Hyslop P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Using 10 mm LiCl, we mimicked the activation of the Wnt cascade by inhibiting GSK 3β activity. This results in an increase in cytosolic levels of β-catenin. Increasing free β-catenin facilitates the association of β-catenin with hTcf-4 and the subsequent transcription by the complex. Cells were again transfected with the pTopFlash plasmid and, following transfection, treated with 10 mm LiCl or aqueous vehicle for 24 h. Treatment with LiCl resulted in an average 7-fold increase in signal, consistent with an increase in free β-catenin available for transcriptional activity (Fig.3A). As with the N2a cells, the HEK293 cells expressing the M139V familial AD mutation and the D385E aspartate mutation both showed a highly significant inhibition of β-catenin-mediated transcription, with a 59.0 ± 3.0% and 66.5 ± 2.3% decrease in signal, respectively (Fig.3B). The degree of inhibition was consistent as compared with the vector both basally and following LiCl treatment. The HEK293 cell line overexpressing wild-type PS1 showed an average 23.5 ± 3.5% increase in β-catenin-mediated transcription as compared with the vector (Fig. 3B). The results were consistent both basally and following LiCl treatment. It should be noted that there is variation between the results for the wild-type PS1 transfected in the N2a and HEK293 cells. This is most likely related to cell type variability. We have previously shown that the wild-type PS1 transfected in PC12 cells shows a significant decrease in β-catenin-mediated signaling, which is further inhibited by mutations in PS1 (14Murayama M. Tanaka S. Palacino J. Murayama O. Honda T. Sun X. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Wolozin B. Takashima A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As an independent method of inhibiting GSK 3β activity, we repeated the experiments using a cotransfection protocol with a mutant β-catenin construct. The S33V substitution in β-catenin removes one of the two critical GSK 3β phosphorylation sites, resulting in a decreased rate of degradation for β-catenin (25Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3515) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of this construct with the pTopFlash plasmid increased the luciferase signal approximately 3-fold over the control cotransfection of pcDNA3/TopFlash (Fig. 3C). We also examined pTopFlash transcription following treatment with LiCl (10 mm) or vehicle for 24 h. The M139V and the D385E mutants caused a significant decrease in transcription both basally and following LiCl treatment (60.7 ± 1.3 and 77.4 ± 1.6, respectively), which is consistent with the data from the initial experiment (Fig.3C).

O'Donnell M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3613-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Trimeric gp45 and PCNA and the dimeric β-clamp each have six domains with flexible connecting loops tethering these domains. In all of the x-ray crystal structures, the sliding clamps are closed at all of the subunit interfaces. However, we have shown that in solution gp45 adopts a conformation where one subunit interface is open by about 20 Å (15Alley S.C. Abel-Santos E. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3076-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a gap that is almost large enough for duplex DNA to pass through. In contrast, the E. coli β-clamp appears to be closed in solution since the interior of the subunit interface is resistant to chemical modification (20Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The β-clamp binds to DNA much tighter than does gp45 (the γ-complex is required to unload the β-clamp (27Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M.

The x-ray crystal structure of the RB69 DNA polymerase has also been solved (28Wang J. Sattar A.K.M.A. Wang C.-C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A.

Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), having a lack of significant homology. The C terminus of gp43 is a largely unstructured extension and is absolutely essential for interaction with gp45; removal of the last six C-terminal amino acids had no effect on the polymerase activity or DNA binding ability, but interactions with gp45 and processivity are abolished (31Berdis A.J. Soumillion P Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12822-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have shown that a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of gp43 inhibits the holoenzyme assembly reaction by blocking gp45 and gp44/62 interaction, binds to gp45 with a KD of 7 µm and a 1:1 peptide to gp45 monomer stoichiometry, and forms photocross-links with Ala-159 of gp45, an amino acid that lies on the gp45 subunit interface (31Berdis A.J.

This final result coupled with the observation that gp45 is not completely closed in the final holoenzyme but that one subunit interface is still open by 11 Å led us to propose that the C terminus of gp43 is inserted into the open subunit interface of gp45 (15Alley S.C.

To refine our previous model of the bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme, we have employed a variety of methods to provide additional solution data on the structure of this multiprotein complex. 1) Fluorescence-resonance energy transfer measurements between the C-terminal peptide of gp43 and several gp45 mutants demonstrate that there are two distinct locations on gp45 where the C-terminal peptide of gp43 can bind. 2) Biophysical characterization of a monomeric mutant of gp45 demonstrates that one of these locations is not found in the final holoenzyme, but this does not exclude the other location from participating in intermediate holoenzyme assembly steps. 3) Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements demonstrate that a gp43 mutant lacking the six C-terminal residues still interacts with gp45, but with an affinity 2 orders of magnitude weaker than with wild-type gp43. 4) Finally, photocross-linking followed by mass spectrometry was used to demonstrate that there are additional contact points between gp43 and gp45 beyond our previously demonstrated contact between the C terminus of gp43 and the subunit interface of gp45 (32Alley S.C.

Step 1, the hydrochloride salt of 4-azidotetrafluorobenzylamine was dissolved in 1 ml of DMF and added toN-t-boc-biocytin (23 mg; 4.9 × 10−5 mol; 1.0 eq), 1-(3-dimethylamino)propyl)-3-ethyl carbodiimide (11 mg; 5.8 × 10−5 mol; 1.2 eq), andN-hydroxysuccinimide (1.0 mg; 8.7 × 10−6mol; 0.20 eq) in a small round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar. Triethylamine (17 µl; 1.2 × 10−4 mol; 2.5 eq) was added. The reaction was monitored by TLC (10% MeOH/CH2Cl2) and allowed to stir at room temperature overnight in the dark. The solvent was evaporatedin vacuo, and the sample was taken up in ethyl acetate and washed twice with 5% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 1). The organic layer (one major compound by TLC) was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated (MS (ESI+), m/z 675.2 ([M + H]+, theoretical value, 675.3)). Step 2, methylene chloride (2 ml) and trifluoroacetic acid (1 ml) were added to the residue, which dissolved immediately upon addition of trifluoroacetic acid. The reaction was monitored by TLC (10% MeOH/CH2Cl2 with a drop of triethylamine, stained with ninhydrin (0.1% in isopropyl alcohol)) and found to be complete at 2.5 h. The solvent was reduced in vacuo. The product was 95% pure by HPLC performed on a Waters (Milford, MA) HPLC system with a C18 column using gradient A at 1 ml/min: solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile; 100% solvent A for 2 min, a 20-min linear gradient to 50% solvent B, and a 5-min linear gradient to 100% solvent B. The product eluted at 19 min (MS (ESI+),m/z 575.2 ([M + H]+, theoretical value, 575.2)). Step 3, half of the product of step 2 was dissolved in DMF. Iodoacetic acid (succinimidyl ester; 6.9 mg; 2.4 × 10−5 mol; 1.0 eq) and triethylamine (7 µl; until basic) were added. The reaction was complete after 4 h as monitored by HPLC (elution time of the product was 23 min using gradient A). The product was purified by preparative HPLC on a C18 column on a Beckman (Palo Alto, CA) HPLC system, using the following gradient at 4 ml/min: solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B acetonitrile; a 2-min linear gradient from 0 to 50% solvent B, a 20-min linear gradient to 70% solvent B, and then 70% solvent B. The compound eluted between 25 and 28 min (MS (ESI+), m/z 743.1 ([M + H]+, theoretical value, 743.1)). This product was then used to label gp45. The gp45 mutant I107C (1 ml of 81 µm trimers) was dialyzed versus 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 10% glycerol (storage buffer) to remove β-mercaptoethanol used for storage. The trifunctional photocross-linker (100 µl of 4.5 mm) dissolved in DMF was added, and the mixture nutated in the dark for 6 h. Conjugated I107C was purified away from unconjugated photocross-linker by FPLC using the gradient described below. The trifunctional photocross-linkers we have constructed are difficult to dialyze away from the proteins we have investigated (at least 3 buffer changes are often required). Analytical scale photocross-linking reactions (20 µl total volume) contained 1 µm conjugated I107C in the presence or absence of 1 µm gp44/62, 1 µm gp43, 1 µm DNA (a self-concatenating primer-template), and 1 mm ATP in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium acetate, and 10 mm magnesium acetate. Photocross-linking reactions were performed and analyzed as described previously (32Alley S.C. Jones A.D. Soumillion P. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol.

Alternatively, gp45 I107C (500 µl of 50 µm trimers) was dialyzed versus storage buffer, andN-(4-azidophenylthio)phthalimide (50 µl of 10 mm) dissolved in DMF was added and the mixture nutated in the dark at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Following conjugation, the mixture was passed through Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) to remove any unincorporated photocross-linker. Preparative scale photocross-linking reactions (1 ml total volume) contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, 2.5 µm 4-azidophenylthio-I107C, 2 µm gp44/62, 2 µm gp43, 2 µm DNA (biotinylated forked primer-template (33Alley S.C.

All components except 4-azidophenylthio-I107C and ATP were premixed in a microcentrifuge tube. Under safe light illumination, 4-azidophenylthio-I107C and ATP were sequentially added. Small aliquots (20 µl) of the reaction mixture were then each placed into 50 microcentrifuge tubes in a standard 80-hole microcentrifuge tube rack to improve photocross-linking yields. Photocross-linking was carried out as described previously (32Alley S.C. Jones A.D. Soumillion P. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol.

The buffer was then changed to storage buffer plus 0.1% β-octyl glucoside using an Amicon Centricon-10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which also removed ATP and ADP. This mixture was then chromatographed on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system with a 5/5 Mono-Q anion-exchange column using the following gradient at 1 ml min−1: solvent A, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA; solvent B, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA; 10% solvent B for 5 min, a 23-min linear gradient to 35% solvent B, a 4-min linear gradient to 100% solvent B, 100% solvent B for 3 min, and a 2-min linear gradient to 10% solvent B. gp44/62 eluted in the void volume, uncross-linked gp43 eluted at 14 min, uncross-linked gp45 eluted at 22 min, and gp43-gp45 cross-links eluted at 24 min. Both uncross-linked and cross-linked gp43 were collected, and β-octyl glucoside and dithiothreitol were immediately added to a final concentration of 0.1% and 2.5 mm, respectively. The sample with reduced, cross-linked gp43 and gp45 was then concentrated using a Centricon-10, rechromatographed on the FPLC using the same gradient, and reduced, cross-linked gp43 was collected. The buffer of the gp43 mixtures was then changed to 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate and 0.02% β-octyl glucoside using a Centricon-10, and the volume was reduced to about 200 µl. l-1-Tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (5 µg) was then added, and the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Formic acid (2 µl) was added to stop the reaction. HPLC electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analyses were performed using a model 1100 HPLC (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) interfaced to a Mariner mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Spectra were obtained in a positive ion mode. Aliquots of the above tryptic digest were injected onto a 1 × 50-mm BetaBasic C18 column (Keystone Scientific, Bellefonte, PA) and eluted using a pre-injection split (pump flow rate = 0.5 ml/min; column flow rate was ∼0.05 ml/min) and a solvent gradient based upon solvent A = 0.15% formic acid in H2O and solvent B = 0.15% formic acid in acetonitrile. The gradient consisted of 95% solvent A, 5% solvent B from 0 to 2 min followed by a linear gradient to 30% solvent A, 70% solvent B from 22 to 40 min. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were made using an ISA (Edison, NJ) FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorimeter using the following parameters: 280 nm excitation wavelength, 5 (acceptor sensitization) or 3.75 nm (donor quenching) slit width, 0.5-s integration time, 5-mm excitation path length, and 10-mm emission path length at 25 °C. Emission was measured at the maximum emission wavelength of the gp45 mutants (given in Table II) for donor quenching or at 492 nm for acceptor sensitization and was corrected for dilution and background fluorescence. The extinction coefficient of the IAEDANS acceptor (εA) was found to be 1287 m−1cm−1 at 280 nm. The extinction coefficient of the tryptophan donor (εD) was assumed to be 5700m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm, yielding an εA/εD value (used below) of 0.2258.Table IIDonor quenching and acceptor sensitization values for single—tryptophan gp45 mutantsMutantEmission maximumDonor quenchingAcceptor sensitizationFsat(FDA)KD2-aKD values were determined from titrating peptide I-IAEDANS into a gp45 solution.Fsat(FD)KD2-bKD values were determined from titrating peptide 1 into a gp45 solution.Fsat(FAD)KD2-cKD values were determined from titrating gp45 into a peptide 1-IAEDANS solution.nmµmµmµmW199F3330.56843.36 ± 0.110.84004.68 ± 0.446.64222.65 ± 0.23W92F3460.18686.11 ± 0.201.23163.25 ± 0.199.66194.32 ± 0.47Y39W/W92F/W199F3410.00636.20 ± 0.070.701710.47 ± 0.628.368610.30 ± 1.16W92F/F109W/W199F3560.14161.11 ± 0.050.46690.94 ± 0.037.84042.35 ± 0.12W92F/Y165W/W199F3310.49716.41 ± 0.280.99892-dSince these Fsatvalues are very close to 1, excess peptide 1 was added to these mutants rather than performing a full titration; a KD value was therefore not determined.NA2-aKD values were determined from titrating peptide I-IAEDANS into a gp45 solution.2-eNA, not applicable.6.37962.03 ± 0.12W92F/F152W/W199F3320.46915.59 ± 0.181.00832-dSince these Fsatvalues are very close to 1, excess peptide 1 was added to these mutants rather than performing a full titration; a KD value was therefore not determined.NA2-dSince these Fsatvalues are very close to 1, excess peptide 1 was added to these mutants rather than performing a full titration; a KD value was therefore not determined.2-eNA, not applicable.8.42672.73 ± 0.13W92F/V163C/W199FNA2-fThis mutant does not contain any tryptophan and is therefore nonfluorescent.

https://openalex.org/W2149621126,"It has been reported that the chemically synthesized 3′-sulfo-Lea and 3′-sulfo-Lex epitopes have a high potential as a ligand for selectins. To elucidate the physiological functions of 3′-sulfated Lewis epitopes, a remodeling system was developed using a combination of a βGal-3-O-sulfotransferase GP3ST, hitherto known α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferases (FucT-III, IV, V, VI, VII, and IX) and arylsulfatase A. The pyridylaminated (PA) lacto-N-tetraose (Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc) was first converted to 3′-sulfolacto-N-fucopentaose II (sulfo-3Galβ1–3(Fucα1–4)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc)-PA by sequential reactions with GP3ST and FucT-III. The 3′-sulfolacto-N-fucopentaose III (sulfo-3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc)-PA was then synthesized from lacto-N-neotetraose (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc)-PA by GP3ST and FucT-III, -IV, -V, -VI, -VII, or -IX in a similar manner. The substrate specificity for the 3′-sulfated acceptor of the α1,3-fucosyltransferases was considerably different from that for the non-substituted and 3′-sialylated varieties. When the GP3ST gene was introduced into A549 and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing FucT-III, they began to express 3′-sulfo-Lea and 3′-sulfo-Lex epitopes, respectively, suggesting that GP3ST is responsible for their biosynthesis in vivo. The expression of the 3′-sialyl-Lex epitope on Chinese hamster ovary cells was attenuated by the introduction of GP3STgene, indicating that GP3ST and α2,3-sialyltransferase compete for the common Galβ1–4GlcNAc-R oligosaccharides. Last, arylsulfatase A, which is a lysosomal hydrolase that catalyzes the desulfation of 3-O-sulfogalactosyl residues in glycolipids, was found to hydrolyze the sulfate ester bond on the 3′-sulfo-Lex (type 2 chain) but not that on the 3′-sulfo-Lea (type 1 chain). The present remodeling system might be of potential use as a tool for the study of the physiological roles of 3′-sulfated Lewis epitopes, including interaction with selectins.

The pyridylaminated (PA) lacto-N-tetraose (Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc) was first converted to 3′-sulfolacto-N-fucopentaose II (sulfo-3Galβ1–3(Fucα1–4)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc)-PA by sequential reactions with GP3ST and FucT-III. The 3′-sulfolacto-N-fucopentaose III (sulfo-3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc)-PA was then synthesized from lacto-N-neotetraose (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc)-PA by GP3ST and FucT-III, -IV, -V, -VI, -VII, or -IX in a similar manner. The substrate specificity for the 3′-sulfated acceptor of the α1,3-fucosyltransferases was considerably different from that for the non-substituted and 3′-sialylated varieties. When the GP3ST gene was introduced into A549 and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing FucT-III, they began to express 3′-sulfo-Lea and 3′-sulfo-Lex epitopes, respectively, suggesting that GP3ST is responsible for their biosynthesis in vivo. The expression of the 3′-sialyl-Lex epitope on Chinese hamster ovary cells was attenuated by the introduction of GP3STgene, indicating that GP3ST and α2,3-sialyltransferase compete for the common Galβ1–4GlcNAc-R oligosaccharides. Last, arylsulfatase A, which is a lysosomal hydrolase that catalyzes the desulfation of 3-O-sulfogalactosyl residues in glycolipids, was found to hydrolyze the sulfate ester bond on the 3′-sulfo-Lex (type 2 chain) but not that on the 3′-sulfo-Lea (type 1 chain). The present remodeling system might be of potential use as a tool for the study of the physiological roles of 3′-sulfated Lewis epitopes, including interaction with selectins. βGal-3-O-sulfotransferase Chinese hamster ovary cells 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid monoclonal antibody 2-aminopyridine adenosine 3′-phosphate,5′-phosphosulfate lacto-N-tetraose, Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc lacto-N-neotetraose, Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc Galβ1–3(Fucα1–4)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc Lewis a antigen, Galβ1–3(Fucα1–4)GlcNAc-R Lewis x antigen, Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc-R 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid high performance liquid chromatography phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Sulfated glycoconjugates occur in a wide range of biological compounds, including glycoproteins, proteoglycans, glycolipids, and polysaccharides (for a review, see Ref. 1Brockhausen I.

The negative charge of the sulfate group is thought to serve as an adherent force in interactions with a variety of functional molecules, which include growth factors, cellular adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix proteins (1Brockhausen I.

The expression of the 3′-sulfo-Lea epitope decreases with increasing depth of invasion of human colon carcinomas (20Yamachika T. Nakanishi H. Inada K. Kitoh K. Kato T. Irimura T. Tatematsu M. Virch. Arch. 1997; 431: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and human colon carcinoma cells expressing the 3′-sulfo-Lea epitope show a lower tumorigenicity in nude mice (21Vavasseur F. Dole K.

On the other hand, the 3′-sulfo-Lea and/or -Lex determinants have been detected in cancer cells as well as in surrounding nonmalignant epithelia in human colon cancer tissues (22Izawa M. Kumamoto K.

These findings indicate that 3′-sulfated Lewis epitopes may serve as a relevant ligand for selectins in vivo and that their expression modulates tumor progression, in the case of human colon cancer. However, the lack of genetic tools for the remodeling of such epitopes has hampered the complete characterization of their biological functions. We recently reported on the cDNA cloning of a βGal 3-O-sulfotransferase (GP3ST)1 that acts on both type 1 (Galβ1–3GlcNAc-R) and type 2 (Galβ1–4GlcNAc-R) chains and is expressed in human colonic mucosa (23Honke K.

Its molecular cloning enabled us to develop a remodeling system of 3′-sulfated Lewis epitopes. The enzymatic degradation of these epitopes is also discussed. PAPS was purchased from Sigma; lacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-neotetraose were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan); l-fucose and GDP-Fuc from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Lc4-PA and nLc4-PA were synthesized by the pyridylamination of lacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-neotetraose using a GlycoTAG Reagent kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan) with an automated pyridylamination apparatus (GlycoTAG, Takara). FucT-III was isolated from a conditioned medium of CHO cells that had been transfected with pSec-FucT-III, which was constructed by recombination of the DNA fragments encoding the open reading frame portion of human FucT-III (25Kukowska-Latallo J.F.

Mouse IgG1 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) was used as the negative control. 3′-Sulfo-Lc4-PA and 3′-sulfo-nLc4-PA were synthesized by sulfation of Lc4-PA and nLc4-PA, respectively, using a recombinant GP3ST, and the resulting material was purified by anion exchange chromatography and subsequent reversed-phase HPLC as described previously (23Honke K.

The mass spectra were acquired by negative ion detection and 3′-sulfo-Lc4-PA and 3′-sulfo-nLc4-PA were identified at m/z 864.2 and 864.4, respectively. 3′-Sialyl-Lc4-PA and 3′-sialyl-nLc4-PA were synthesized by α2,3-sialyltransferase from Lc4-PA and nLc4-PA, respectively. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 8 h in a solution comprised of 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.4), 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm CMP-NeuAc (Calbiochem), 1 mm Lc4-PA or nLc4-PA, and 0.6 µg of α2,3-sialyltransferase (Calbiochem) in a final volume of 50 µl, and reaction products were isolated using HPLC as described above. 3′-Sialyl-nLc4-PA was identified at m/z 1075.3 by negative detection, using the quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The standard incubation mixture contained the following components in a total volume of 10 µl: 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5), 25 mm MnCl2, 5 mm ATP, 10 mml-fucose, 75 µm GDP-Fuc, 25 µm of each acceptor substrate except for 3′-sialyl-Lc4-PA, which was used at a concentration of 12.5 µm, and 5 µl of purified FucT-III. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction was terminated by boiling for 4 min. After the addition of 90 µl of water, the sample was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min and 20 µl of the supernatant was injected onto a TSKgel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Shimazu LC-VP HPLC system (Kyoto, Japan) and eluted with a 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) at flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 35 °C, and monitored with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation, 320 nm; emission, 400 nm). The fractions containing 3′-sulfolacto-N-fucopentaose II-PA and 3′-sulfolacto-N-fucopentaose III-PA were pooled, dried, and determined by mass spectrometry as described above.

The other assay conditions were the same as described above. CHO and A549 cells were transfected with linealized pcXN2-GP3ST and/or pcDNA-FucT-III genes using the EffecteneTM Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the standard protocol for stable transfection and selected for clones stably expressing these genes, based on their resistance to G418 (Sigma) and/or Zeocin (Invitrogen) followed by measurement of the enzyme activities, as described above. The cloned cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 400 µg/ml G418, and/or 150 µg/ml Zeocin and harvested with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA. Fifty µl of cell suspensions (5–10 × 106 cells) were incubated with a primary antibody (SU59 diluted 1:5; P12 and KM93 diluted 1:25; MAB2108, ZY-CO9, 91.9H, and control immunogloblins at a dilution of 1:50) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed with 1 ml of PBS, resuspended in 100 µl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2fragment of goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako) diluted 1:25 and incubated for 30 min on ice. Flow cytometry analyses were performed using a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson, Frankin Lakes, NJ) operating with CELLQuest software. Parental CHO cells and CHO cells transfected with the GP3ST and/or FucT-III genes were suspended in 4 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cell and tissue extracts (Wako, Osaka, Japan). After incubation on ice for 1 h, the solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min and the supernatants were used as cell lysates. Protein concentration was assayed by means of a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH), and stained with mAb SU59 diluted 1:5 and mAb KM93 diluted 1:20. In order to examine a susceptibility to an N-glycanase, a blotted membrane blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin was treated with 30 units ofN-glycanase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basal, Switzerland) in 4 ml of PBS at 37 °C for 24 h prior to incubation with SU59. The reaction mixture contained the following components in a total volume of 50 µl: 0.5 m acetate/NaOH buffer (pH 5.0), 0.6 µm of each substrate in the presence or absence of arylsulfatase A. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction was terminated by boiling for 3 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min and 20 µl of the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC as described above. The doubly transfected CHO cells, which were stably expressing theGP3ST and FucT-III genes, were treated with arylsulfatase A. These cells were harvested with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and 150 µl of cell suspension (1–5 × 107 cells) was then incubated in 20 mmacetate-NaOH buffer (pH 5.0), 150 mm NaCl in the presence or absence of arylsulfatase A. After incubation at 37 °C for 12 h by rotating, cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS and resuspended in 50 µl with the primary antibody mAb SU59 diluted 1:5 for 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins diluted 1:25 for 30 min on ice. Flow cytometry analysis was performed as described above. In a previous study (23Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Nakayama J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), GP3ST was found to act on both lacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-neotetraose, but not on lacto-N-fucopentaose II or lacto-N-fucopentaose III, suggesting that 3′-sulfation of the terminal Gal occurs prior to the α3/4-fucosylation of the penultimate GlcNAc in the biosynthetic pathway of the 3′-sulfo-Lea and -Lexstructures. Our knowledge is incomplete on the use of crude enzyme sources on the α3/4-fucosylation of 3′-sulfated Galβ1–3/4GlcNAc-R oligosaccharides (32Chandrasekaran E.V. Jain R.K. Matta K.L. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated biosynthesis of 3′-sulfo-Lea and -Lex structures extensively using recombinant GP3ST and α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferases. Since 3′-sialylation also occurs prior to the α3/4-fucosylation in the synthetic pathway of 3′-sialyl-Lea and -Lex(34Hansson G.C. Zopf D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9388-9392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Holmes E.H. Ostrander G.K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3737-3743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effects of α1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferases on non-substituted 3′-sialylated and 3′-sulfated Galβ1–3/4GlcNAc-R oligosaccharides were compared. The α1,4-fucosylation of the 3′-sulfated type 1 chain (Galβ1–3GlcNAc-R) was examined first. 3′-Sulfo-Lc4-PA was synthesized from Lc4-PA via catalysis by GP3ST (23Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Nakayama J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The resulting 3′-sulfo-Lc4-PA was then subjected to fucosylation by recombinant FucT-III, which is the sole α1,4-fucosyltransferase (25Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.P. Low J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). A strong product peak appeared, as shown by an arrow, in Fig.1b in the presence of GDP-Fuc (Fig. 1b), whereas no peak was detected in the absence of the donor substrate (Fig. 1a). The m/zvalue of the material in the product peak was 1010.4, corresponding to that of 3′-sulfolacto-N-fucopentaose II-PA (Fig.1c). These results indicate that FucT-III has the capability to act on the 3′-sulfated type 1 chain and to synthesize the 3′-sulfo-Lea structure. The efficiency of FucT-III for non-substituted 3′-sialylated and 3′-sulfated acceptors was also compared (Table I). The result indicates that FucT-III prefers 3′-sulfo-Lc4-PA to the non-substituted Lc4-PA or 3′-sialyl-Lc4-PA.Table ISubstrate specificity of α1.3/1.4-fucosyltransferase (FucT-III)Acceptor1-aThe concentration of acceptors was 25 µm, except for 3′-sialyl-Lc4-PA, which was used at a concentration of 12.5 µm.Activity1-bFive microliters of recombinant FucT-III was used for each assay.pmol/min/mlGalβ1→3GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc→PA (Lc4-PA)217.3NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→3GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc→PA (3′-sialyl-Lc4-PA)60.7SO3→3Galβ1→3GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc→PA (3′-sulfo-Lc4-PA)320.1Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc→PA (nLc4-PA)2.6NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc→PA (3′ sialyl-nLc4-PA)3.3SO3→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc→PA (3′ sulfo-nLc4-PA)20.71-a The concentration of acceptors was 25 µm, except for 3′-sialyl-Lc4-PA, which was used at a concentration of 12.5 µm.1-b Five microliters of recombinant FucT-III was used for each assay.

Since the substrate specificity of α1,3-fucosyltransferases for 3′-sulfated acceptors has not been investigated, this was examined, compared with that for non-substituted and 3′-sialylated acceptors. When 3′-sulfo-nLc4-PA was incubated with FucT-III in the presence of GDP-Fuc, 3′-sulfolacto-N-fucopentaose III was produced (Fig. 1,e and f). As shown in Table I, FucT-III preferred the 3′-sulfated nLc4-PA to nLc4-PA or 3′-sialyl-nLc4-PA, and preferred the type 1 chain to the type 2 chain, as described previously (25Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.P. Low J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The α3-fucosylation of 3′-sulfo-nLc4-PA was then examined with respect to the other α1,3-fucosyltransferases. Since the sources and specific activities of the fucosyltransferases used were different, the activities toward individual acceptors are expressed relative to those toward nLc4-PA (FucT-III, -IV, -V, -VI, and -IX) or 3′-sialyl-nLc4-PA (FucT-VII) in Table II. The preference for the sulfated acceptor among the α1,3-fucosyltransferases was considerably different from that for the sialylated or non-substituted acceptors. All the α1,3-fucosyltransferases acted on the sulfated acceptor unlike the sialylated one, although the extent of relative reaction efficiency was varied, depending on the specific enzyme. It was noted that the 3′-sulfated oligosaccharide was a better substrate than the non-substituted or 3′-sialylated oligosaccharide for FucT-III, -V, and -VI.Table IISubstrate specificity of α1,3-fucosyltransferases for non-substituted, 3′-sialylated and 3′-sulfated acceptorsAcceptor2-aThe concentration of acceptors was 25 µm.Relative activity2-bThe values represent the percentage of the activity, compared with that for nLc4-PA, except for FucT-VII in which relative activities to that for 3′-sialyl-nLc4-PA are shown. α1,3-Fucosyltransferase activities for nLc4-PA of FucT-III, -IV, -V, -VI, and -IX were 3.6, 64.9, 75.1, 6.0, and 144.9 pmol/min/ml, respectively. α1,3-Fucosyltransferase activity for 3′-sialyl nLc4-PA of FucT-VII was 593.0 pmol/min/ml.FucT-III-IV-V-VI-VII-IX%Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc→PA (nLc4-PA)1001001001001100NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc→PA (3′-sialyl-nLc4-PA)12852041161001SO3→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc→PA (3′-sulfo-nLc4-PA)803958654233562-a The concentration of acceptors was 25 µm.2-b The values represent the percentage of the activity, compared with that for nLc4-PA, except for FucT-VII in which relative activities to that for 3′-sialyl-nLc4-PA are shown. α1,3-Fucosyltransferase activities for nLc4-PA of FucT-III, -IV, -V, -VI, and -IX were 3.6, 64.9, 75.1, 6.0, and 144.9 pmol/min/ml, respectively. α1,3-Fucosyltransferase activity for 3′-sialyl nLc4-PA of FucT-VII was 593.0 pmol/min/ml.

Flavocytochrome b has also been proposed to function as a voltage-gated proton transporter that maintains intracellular pH and membrane potential during the oxidative burst (19Henderson L.M.

The characteristic absorbance spectrum of flavocytochrome bis attributed to the presence of heme prosthetic groups that are non-covalently coordinated by histidine residues within the protein. Due to the tenuous nature of this ligation scheme, the heme spectrum is lost under conditions that separate the individual subunits (21Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 932: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), although heme remains associated with both subunits during electrophoresis at low temperature with lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE (22Quinn M.T. Mullen M.L. Jesaitis A.J. Clin. Res. 1991; 39: 353Google Scholar). Additionally, the detergent-solubilized protein is highly susceptible to proteolysis by the numerous endogenous phagocyte proteinases. These and other factors have prevented direct identification of the regions of the flavocytochrome bheterodimer that are responsible for heme coordination. There are, however, several lines of indirect evidence deriving from mutational (23Tsuda M. Kaneda M. Sakiyama T. Inana I. Owada M. Kiryu C. Shiraishi T. Kakinuma K. Hum.

Inferences have also been made of a stacked heme orientation within the membrane bilayer, coordinated by two transmembrane helices of gp91phox based on similarities in primary sequence, spectral properties, and redox potentials between flavocytochrome band select members of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family, including FRE1 ferric reductase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Finegold A.A.

Likewise, heme localization within gp91phox has been inferred based on similarities to heme-coordinating regions of cytochrome P450 of Pseudomonas putida (31Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Gunsalus I.C.

The intent of this study was to isolate and identify proteinase-stable heme-ligating regions of flavocytochrome b. Partially purified flavocytochrome b was exposed to staphylococcal V8 proteinase (endoproteinase Glu-C). HPLC size exclusion chromatography was then used to isolate proteolytic fragments that retained the characteristic 414-nm heme absorbance spectrum. With this approach, we successfully isolated a spectrally native polypeptide core that was then characterized by amino acid sequencing and immunoblotting. The fragment was found to be a heterodimer composed of the NH2-terminal 336–363 amino acid residues of gp91phox and the NH2-terminal 169–171 amino acid residues of p22phox. The core fragment retained 74% of the native heme absorbance, suggesting that it contained all of the heme-ligating regions of flavocytochrome b. These findings suggest that the hemes are positioned intra- or juxtamembrane within the NH2-terminal predicted transmembrane-spanning regions of the protein.

Isolation of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes from whole blood and purification of flavocytochrome b was carried out as described previously (9Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J.

The wheat germ agglutinin affinity steps were eliminated to reduce the degree of sample handling, thus resulting in higher recoveries of flavocytochrome b without having an apparent effect on the overall purity. After loading, the heparin column containing the flavocytochrome b was washed with 10–20 bed volumes of heparin wash buffer and eluted using either a 50 mm to 2.0m NaCl gradient or a 6-ml bolus of 1.0 m NaCl, both in heparin elution buffer. 1-ml fractions were collected, and the peak flavocytochrome b-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to a final volume of ∼1 ml using a 30-kDa nominal molecular weight cutoff centrifugal concentration device. As a final purification step prior to digestion, the retentate was subjected to an HPLC size exclusion chromatography step, as described below, and collected in 400-µl aliquots. Aliquots that were reserved for predigested controls had PMSF and chymostatin added to 1 mmand 10 µg/ml, respectively. Beginning with the solubilization step, all purification and digestion steps were accomplished in 1 day with all samples kept on wet ice prior to digestion. Flavocytochromeb heme content prior to heparin purification was quantitated using the reduced minus oxidized spectrum at 558 nm using Δε558 = 29.3 (mm cm)−1 (37Lutter R. Van Shaik M.L.J.

After heparin purification, flavocytochromeb heme quantitation was carried out using ε414= 130.8 (mm cm)−1 (37Lutter R. Van Shaik M.L.J. Van Zwieten R. Wever R. Roos D. Hamers M.N. J. Biol.

Absorbance values were determined using either a Hewlett-Packard HP 8452A diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer or a Molecular Dynamics Spectra-Max 250, environmentally controlled, 96-well microtiter plate, UV-visible spectrophotometer. When necessary, the samples were sonicated using either a Fisher 50 probe style Sonic Dismembrator, model XL2005, or a Fisher brand bath sonicator, model FS30. All HPLC analyses were carried out using a Hitachi, LS-6200 HPLC with an F-1050 fluorescence detector connected in series with an L-7450A UV-visible Diode Array Detector. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 200 HR®, 10–30 column, maintained at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, equilibrated for a minimum of 1.5 h prior to sample injection. The column was calibrated using size exclusion chromatography standards (Bio-Rad catalog number 1511901) that included thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; γ-globulin, 158 kDa; ovalbumin, 44 kDa; myoglobin, 17 kDa, and vitamin B12, 1.35 kDa. The standard curve was fitted using a non-linear regression algorithm (GraphPad Prism version 3.01 for Windows 95, GraphPad Software, San Diego, www.graphpad.com). Prior to HPLC size exclusion chromatography, all samples were bath sonicated for 1–2 s and passed through a 0.2-µm pore size syringe filter. HPLC elution fractions were collected from the column in 400-µl aliquots at 1-min intervals. Time point samplings for V8 digestions were removed from the digestion vessel and placed on wet ice with proteinase inhibitors prior to separation by HPLC size exclusion using the same procedures as for intact flavocytochrome b. All absorbance values were corrected for dilution and differences in HPLC injection volumes. Lyophilized V8 proteinase was reconstituted at 50–500 µg/ml in either distilled water or HPLC column buffer and added to the partially purified flavocytochromeb samples, while mixing, to a final ratio of 1:15 (w/w), proteinase to flavocytochrome b heme (assuming a flavocytochrome b heterodimer molecular mass of 110 kDa). The digestion was carried out at 37 °C in a continuously stirred vessel and terminated by placement on wet ice and addition of PMSF and chymostatin to final concentrations of 1 mm and 10 µg/ml, respectively. Digested samples were stored on ice at 4 °C until further analyses were conducted. Initial quantities of purified flavocytochrome b used for digestion ranged between 1.8 and 2.7 nmol of heme. The fractions retained from the HPLC runs had additional PMSF and chymostatin added to the same concentrations as above and were kept on ice until further analyses were conducted. Heme quantitation of HPLC fractions was carried out by modifying the procedure originally described (38Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal.

Assays were conducted in 96-well microtiter plates, and absorbance values were measured with a Molecular Dynamics Spectra-Max 250 UV-visible, environmentally controlled microtiter plate spectrophotometer. Reagents used in the assay were prepared immediately prior to use. The short incubation times combined with the large number of samples that were simultaneously tested required the use of a multitipped pipette to reduce timing errors in the mixing of the individual microtiter plate wells. Hemin standard solutions were prepared for initial quantitation as reduced, alkaline pyridine-solubilized hemochrome (37Lutter R. Van Shaik M.L.J. Van Zwieten R. Wever R. Roos D. Hamers M.N. J. Biol.

TMBZ solution consisted of 10 mg of dry TMBZ mixed with 500 µl of glacial acetic acid, filtered through a 0.2 µm pore size polyethersulfone membrane filter. 15 µl of the TMBZ solution was mixed, per well, with 30 µl of hemochrome sample, 100 µl of absolute ethanol and incubated at ambient temperature for 2 min. At the end of the 2 min, 15-µl aliquots of 3% H2O2were added per well and the mixtures incubated at ambient temperature for 5 min. The absorbance was then measured at 660 nm, and the hemin concentration of the samples was determined relative to the standards. All absorbance values were corrected for dilution and differences in HPLC injection volumes. Flavocytochromeb containing fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 5–20% acrylamide gradient gels (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar), and electrophoretic transfer of protein to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting was performed as described (41Towbin H.

Nitrocellulose transfers probed with primary antibodies were then probed with goat anti-rabbit, or goat anti-mouse, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using the Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories nitro blue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate developer kit. Silver staining of polyacrylamide gels was carried out by overnight rocking in 50% methanol, 12% acetic acid in water, followed by three 20-min washes in 50% ethanol/water. Gels were then drained, completely submerged for 1 min in a solution containing 0.2 g/liter sodium thiosulfate, and washed 3 times for 30 s each with distilled water. After draining, 100 ml of a solution containing 0.2 g/liter silver nitrate, 1.0 ml/liter formaldehyde in water was added, and the gels were rocked for 20–30 min. The gels were then rinsed three times with water for 30 s each and developed by addition of 200 ml of 60 g/liter sodium carbonate, 1.0 ml/liter 37% (w/w) formaldehyde, and 30 ml/liter of the 0.2 g/liter sodium thiosulfate in distilled water and stopped by addition of 25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid in water. NH2-terminal sequence analyses by Edman degradation were performed by Harvard Microchem (Cambridge, MA), and the samples were prepared as per their recommendations. To reduce the quantity of ubiquitous keratin in the SDS-PAGE reagents, twice recrystallized SDS (46(1999) Current Protocols in Protein Science (Coligan, J. E., Dunn, B. M., Ploegh, H. L., Speicher, D. W., and Wingfield, P. T., eds) p. 10.8.2, John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York.Google Scholar) and distilled water that had been filtered through a 10-kDa nominal molecular weight cutoff filter were used. All other aqueous reagents were filtered through a 0.2-µm pore size membrane filter. Inadvertent chemical modification of the NH2 termini of peptides to be sequenced was avoided by including the following modifications to the SDS-PAGE protocol (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). 5–20% gradient polyacrylamide resolving gels were allowed to polymerize overnight at ambient temperature. The stacking gel was poured, allowed to polymerize, and then pre-run without sample for 45 min at 4 mA constant current in the presence of Running buffer containing 5 µmreduced glutathione. The glutathione-containing buffer was removed; the samples were loaded, and the electrophoresis was conducted at 40 mA constant current using new Running buffer that contained 100 µm thioglycolic acid (47Hunkapiller M.W. Lujan E. Ostrander F. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, stained with Amido Black for visualization (46(1999) Current Protocols in Protein Science (Coligan, J. E., Dunn, B. M., Ploegh, H. L., Speicher, D. W., and Wingfield, P. T., eds) p. 10.8.2, John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York.Google Scholar), excised from the membrane, and the strips washed 3× by gentle vortexing for 15 s each in filtered distilled water. The individual strips were then air-dried and placed in sealed plastic tubes for shipment. The diffuse band centered at ∼90 kDa, and the consolidated bands at 22 kDa were excised for NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the nondigested flavocytochrome b. The single band at 17 kDa and the entire broad band from ∼50 to 70 kDa were excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the 1-h digest fragments. Samples were reduced by addition of an equal volume of DTT solution (50 mm DTT in TS buffer) and heated 4–5 min at 90 °C. Alkylation was performed by adding 0.1 volume (sample + DTT mixture) of iodoacetamide stock (46 mg of iodoacetamide dissolved in 200 mm Tris base, pH 8.0), followed by incubation at 90 °C for 3–4 min with IgG used as a procedural control. Iodoacetamide was added without DTT treatment to sample controls. All samples were then added to sample loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as described above. For chemical deglycosylation, both intact and digested polypeptides were precipitated by addition of 80% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid in distilled water to a final sample concentration of 15% (v/v). Samples were then cooled at −20 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 180,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant fraction was removed, and the pellet was then washed twice in −20 °C acetone to remove the trichloroacetic acid and either allowed to air dry or purged under a stream of dry argon at room temperature. The pellet was then resuspended into 100 µl of neat trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (48Sojar H.T. Bahl O.P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 49Sojar H.T.

At the end of the incubation, the samples were cooled to less than −20 °C by immersion in a mixture of dry ice and ethanol. Neat pyridine, likewise cooled to less than −20 °C, was then slowly added to terminate the reaction. The volatile organic phase was removed under a stream of dry argon at room temperature, and the resulting gel was resuspended in distilled water and dialyzed against several changes of 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The protein was precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to 15% (v/v), incubated at −20 °C for 15 min, and pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were washed twice with −20 °C neat acetone and pelleted each time by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were then reduced and alkylated as described above, mixed with loading buffer, and added directly to the lanes for separation by SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic deglycosylation of flavocytochromeb was carried out using peptideN-glycosidase F HPLC size exclusion chromatography fractions were denatured by addition of SDS to 0.5% in the presence of 10 mm DTT and 1 µl/ml proteinase inhibitor mixture and then heated to 100 °C for 10 min. Reagents supplied by the manufacturer were then added as per their instructions and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with intermittent mixing.

Glycoprotein H (gH), glycoprotein L (gL), and glycoprotein O (gO) associate covalently to form a unique disulfide-bonded tripartite complex. Glycoprotein O was recently discovered, and its basic structure, as well as that of the tripartite complex, remains uncharacterized.

These viruses are large, enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses that establish life-long latent infections within their hosts. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)1 causes multiple clinical sequelae in immunocompromised hosts. HCMV is able to enter and infect a wide variety of host cell types and can cause disease in most organs of the body (1Sinzger C. Jahn G. Intervirology. 1996; 39: 302-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This broad tropism can be attributed in part to a complex set of viral envelope glycoproteins that play a vital role in the viral life cycle by mediating entry of the virus into host cells, cell-to-cell spread of infection, and maturation of virions. Most enveloped viruses, including influenza and human immunodeficiency virus, encode a single fusion glycoprotein that initiates attachment and fusion. In contrast, herpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus require a minimum of four glycoproteins for fusion (2Turner A. Bruun B. Minson T. Browne H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 873-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The multicomponent nature of herpesvirus fusion machinery provokes many questions about the mechanisms by which large viruses with multiple glycoproteins achieve membrane fusion. HCMV enters host cells by a sequential cascade of molecular events involving multiple viral and cellular proteins, culminating with fusion of the envelope with the cellular plasma membrane (3Compton T.

Compton T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5391-5398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This failure led to the discovery that the HCMV gH complex contained a third distinct gene product encoded by the UL74 open reading frame, a protein now designated gO (18Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8191-8197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the UL74 gene has homologs in the genomes of the β-Herpesvirinaesubfamily, which includes HCMV, human herpesvirus 6, and human herpesvirus 7 (18Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8191-8197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, while gH/gL heterodimers predominate in other herpesviruses, the HCMV complex is an unusual tripartite complex composed of gH·gL·gO. This complex appears on the surface of HCMV-infected cells and in the envelopes of virions (18Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8191-8197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Huber M.T.

Virology. 1989; 169: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast to gH and gL, the membrane topology and organization of gO in the tripartite complex are unknown. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of gO reveals several interesting features, including 18 potential N-glycosylation sites and a single hydrophobic domain that begins 14 amino acids from the N terminus. Hydropathy analysis of this segment shows a 20–22-amino acid region that we predicted to serve as both a signal peptide and a membrane anchor domain (18Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8191-8197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region is unusual for a signal peptide because it is inset from the amino terminus and it is long enough to span the bilayer as a membrane anchor. If uncleaved by signal peptidase, this region (a signal/anchor domain) would anchor gO in a type II membrane orientation with a cytosolic amino terminus and a carboxyl-terminal extracellular domain. In this work, we describe experiments demonstrating that, like glycoprotein L, glycoprotein O is a soluble protein that associates with cellular and viral membranes. Human foreskin fibroblasts and immortalized fibroblasts were cultured as previously described (21Compton T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3644-3648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human cytomegalovirus strain AD169 was propagated and titered as previously described (21Compton T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3644-3648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293-T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone, 0.3% glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Harlan Biosciences). All polymerase chain reaction steps were performed usingPfu high fidelity polymerase (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center DNA facility, where the final constructs were also verified by automated DNA sequencing. pCaggs.gO was produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the full-length gO coding region using primers 5′-GGAATTCACCATGGGGAGAAAAGAGATG-3′ and 5′-AAACCGCTCGAGTTACTGCAACCACCA-3′. The product was cut withEcoRI (5′) and XhoI (3′) and was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pCaggs vector (donated by Y. Kawaoka, University of Wisconsin). The gO insert from pCaggs.gO was subcloned into pCDNA3 via EcoRI/XhoI. pCaggs.ΔgO was generated by inserting into the pCaggs vector the region encoding amino acids 33–466 of gO. The ΔgO insert was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pcDNA3.gO template using primers 5′-GGAATTCACCATGAGTAAAGCGCTTTATAATCGTCCTTG-3′ and 5′-AAACCGCTCGAGTTACTGCAACCACCA-3′. TheEcoRI/XhoI-digested ΔgO was ligated into the pCaggs multiple cloning site. pcDNA3.ΔgO resulted from subcloning ΔgO from pCaggs into pcDNA3 via EcoRI/XhoI. The pCaggs.His-gO construct encodes the complete gO coding sequence preceded by a six-residue polyhistidine tag. It was generated in the same manner as pCaggs.gO, except that the 5′ polymerase chain reaction primer was 5′-GGAATTCACCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACATGGGGAGAAAAGAGATG-3′. pcDNA3.His-gO was generated by subcloning His-gO from pCaggs into pcDNA3 via EcoRI/XhoI. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed essentially as previously described (17Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5391-5398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8191-8197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nitrocellulose membranes were washed in TBS containing 0.05% SDS, 0.5% Tween 20, and 20 mg/ml powdered skim milk. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce, and activity was detected using Renaissance enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). UL74 antiserum (recognizing glycoprotein O) was previously described (18Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8191-8197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots probed withUL74 antiserum were hybridized and washed in the presence of wash buffer (described above) and additional cell lysate (100 mm dish confluent 293-T, cos-7, or IF cells lysed in 1 ml of 1% SDS). Rabbit polyclonal antibody 6824 was previously described (17Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5391-5398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 27–78 was kindly provided by W. Britt. Murine monoclonal antibody recognizing Hsp90 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum recognizing calreticulin was purchased from Stressgen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-His serum (His-probe) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Plasmid DNA was purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.38-1.41Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by either calcium phosphate precipitation (23Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar) or genePorter lipid transfection reagent (Gene Transfer Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Calcium phosphate transfections were supplemented with 5 mm sodium butyrate. Immortalized human fibroblasts were either mock-infected or infected with HCMV strain AD169 at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Six days postinfection, the cells were scraped into their media and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture/PIC, pH 7.4) and Dounce-homogenized (final volume 15 ml). Nuclei were pelleted at 1500 × gfor 10 min and discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 × g to pellet microsomal membranes. Supernatant was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and constitutes the cytosolic fraction. Microsomal membranes were prepared from transiently transfected 293-T cells harvested 48 h post-transfection. Microsomal membranes were suspended in 100 µl of buffered sucrose (0.3 m sucrose plus 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) on ice. The suspension was incubated on ice for 60 min in 5 ml of 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 11.5, and 100 mmdithiothreitol, followed by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman 70.1Ti rotor (150,000 × g). The pellet was subjected to an additional round of alkaline carbonate extraction under the same conditions. Supernatants from the washes were pooled and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 200 mmiodoacetic acid. Fractions were suspended in Tris base plus nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 200 mm iodoacetic acid, heated to 65 °C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. One-quarter cell equivalent of the cytosolic fraction, compared with membrane fractions, was analyzed to maintain relative equivalence of protein concentrations among wells. For alkaline carbonate extractions of microsomes from transfected 293-T cells, the dithiothreitol and iodoacetic acid were omitted, and samples were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE. In vitro transcription and translation was performed using the TnT T7 Quick coupled transcription/translation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Immunoprecipitation was performed by diluting 45 µl of translation product in 1 ml of RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA) plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Samples were precleared with protein A beads, followed by incubation overnight with anti-His IgG. Complexes were precipitated with protein A beads, washed five times with RIPA plus bovine serum albumin, and eluted by boiling in RIPA plus reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To test the hypothesis that gO is a type II membrane protein, HCMV-infected cells were subjected to fractionation followed by alkaline carbonate extraction. This technique solubilizes peripheral membrane proteins while leaving transmembrane proteins associated with a membrane pellet (24Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of the resulting cytosolic, carbonate-extracted, and integral membrane proteins revealed that gO partitions in both the peripheral and integral membrane fractions (Fig.1). A majority of gO consistently segregated with transmembrane proteins, while a lesser amount was detected in the peripheral membrane fraction. Controls for each fraction include Hsp90 (cytosol), calreticulin (soluble endoplasmic reticulum protein), and the cytomegalovirus-encoded proteins gH and gB (both type I integral membrane proteins), all of which were recovered in the appropriate fractions. Because gO was found in both membrane fractions in HCMV-infected cells, we hypothesized that the two types of membrane association may result from interactions of gO with other viral proteins. To examine gO in a system isolated from other viral gene products, a similar experiment was conducted using transiently transfected 293-T cells expressing gO (Fig. 2). Although it partitioned differentially in HCMV-infected cells, gO was solely detected in the soluble membrane content fraction of transfected cells. This result, shown in Figs. 1 and 2, demonstrated that gO is more strongly associated with membranes of infected cells than those of transfected cells, suggesting that the affinity of membrane association of gO differs with the context of expression. Initial experiments suggested that gO was not a transmembrane protein. We further tested this hypothesis using two recombinant forms of gO (Fig. 3). One form, designated ΔgO, lacked the amino-terminal 32 amino acids comprising the putative signal/anchor domain. A second construct, designated His-gO, encoded a six-residue polyhistidine sequence on the extreme amino terminus of the protein. The full-length peptide backbone of gO was predicted to be 466 amino acids long, with a molecular mass of ∼51 kDa (18Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8191-8197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chee M.S. Bankier A.T. Beck S. Bohni R. Brown C.M. Cerny R. Horsnell T. Hutchison III C.A. Kouzarides T. Martignetti J.A. Preddie E. Satchwell S.C. Tomlinson P. Weston K.M. Barrell B.G. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 154: 125-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Loss of the 32-amino acid N-terminal hydrophobic sequence predicted a protein of ∼48 kDa for ΔgO. For comparison of the backbone sizes of gO and ΔgO, N-linked glycans were removed by endoglycosidase H treatment of gO-transfected cell lysates and ΔgO-transfected cell lysates. If the signal peptide of gO were uncleaved, we would expect to see a difference in electrophoretic mobility corresponding to the 3-kDa size difference between the peptide backbones of gO and ΔgO (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4, the deglycosylated peptide backbones of gO and ΔgO migrated similarly when subjected to SDS-PAGE, demonstrating that these proteins were the same 48-kDa size (Fig. 4A) and that the signal peptide of gO was cleaved from the mature protein. The identity of the lower 40-kDa band produced by transfection of ΔgO is unknown but may represent a degradation product. Note also that removal of the signal peptide in ΔgO abolished glycosylation, as evidenced by its electrophoretic mobility and insensitivity to glycosidase digestion. To confirm that experiments performed on gO produced by transfection reflected the forms of gO found in HCMV-infected cells, the peptide backbone size of gO was determined in both infected and transfected cells. Cell lysates were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F to remove allN-linked glycans and were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The results in Fig. 4B show that the backbone peptide of gO had the same electrophoretic mobility in transfected and infected cells and that signal peptide processing was similar in these two systems.Figure 4The peptide backbone size of gO is consistent with signal peptide cleavage.A, 293-T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing gO (lanes 3and 4) or ΔgO (lanes 5 and6). Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, lysed in RIPA buffer, and subjected to endoglycosidase H (or mock) treatment. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting demonstrates that the glycan-free backbone of processed gO has equivalent mobility to that expressed by ΔgO. Note that ΔgO does not undergo glycosylation.B, HCMV-infected and mock-infected fibroblasts were harvested on day seven of infection, lysed in RIPA buffer, and subjected to peptide N-glycosidase F digestion. Thelane marked Transfected indicates that gO-transfected 293-T cells were lysed and treated with peptideN-glycosidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further test that the N-terminal signal sequence undergoes signal peptidase cleavage, a polyhistidine tag was added to the extreme amino terminus of gO (Fig. 3). Detection of His-gO expression by immunoblotting with anti-gO serum verified that the recombinant construct expressed glycosylated gO, indicating that the tag did not alter signal peptide function (Fig.5A). Immunoblotting with anti-His serum, however, showed that the tag was absent from processed gO (Fig. 5B). Using in vitro translation, we confirmed that the amino-terminal His tag was translated as part of gO and that it was recognized by our antibody (Fig.6). Thus, our inability to detect the His tag in cells resulted from cleavage of the amino terminus rather than from internal translation initiation. Additionally, in vitrotranslation of gO and ΔgO clearly showed a difference in mobility, indicating that their identical electrophoretic mobility upon expression in cells (Fig. 4) resulted from cleavage of the signal peptide during ER translocation.Figure 6The amino-terminal polyhistidine tag is translated. Coupled transcription and translation of the indicated plasmids was driven by the T7 promoter of pcDNA3 or pHM6 in the presence of radiolabeled methionine. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography before (left) or after (right) immunoprecipitation with anti-His serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The gH·gL·gO complex undergoes multiple steps of assembly during its transit through the secretory pathway of HCMV-infected cells (19Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3886-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With a mass greater than 240 kDa, the mature complex is a disulfide-linked heteroligomer of unknown stoichiometry (6Kaye J.F., U.A., G. Minson A.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2693-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Cranage M.P. Smith G.L. Bell S.E. Hart H. Brown C. Bankier A.T. Tomlinson P. Barrell B.G. Minson T.C. J.

Virology. 1984; 135: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Early studies of HCMV gH and gL showed that gH needs gL for proper trafficking through the secretory apparatus (5Spaete R.R. Perot K. Scott P.I. Nelson J.A. Stinski M.F. Pachl C. Virology. 1993; 193: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Kaye J.F., U.A., G. Minson A.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2693-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). When gH is expressed in the presence of gL, complexes of the two proteins reach the cell surface but are not secreted into the medium. Removal of the C-terminal membrane anchor of gH results in secretion of soluble gH·gL complexes, and when gL is expressed alone it can also be found in the medium (5Spaete R.R. Perot K. Scott P.I. Nelson J.A. Stinski M.F. Pachl C. Virology. 1993; 193: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Kaye J.F., U.A., G. Minson A.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2693-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These data led to the conclusion that gH contains a C-terminal membrane anchor and that gL is held in the viral envelope by its disulfide linkage(s) to gH. Beyond this basic characterization, little is known about the structure of the gH·gL·gO complex. Based on sequence analysis, we hypothesized that the 20-amino acid hydrophobic domain on the amino terminus of gO serves as a signal peptide and membrane anchor. In general, a signal peptide longer than 15–18 amino acids indicates that signal peptidase is unlikely to cleave the nascent chain, leaving an intact amino-terminal transmembrane domain (27Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Several viral envelope proteins, including influenza neuraminidase, are known to have this membrane orientation (28Bos T.J. Davis A.R. Nayak D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2327-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Wilson-Rawls J. Wold W.S. Virology. 1993; 195: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Roberts S.R. Lichtenstein D. Ball L.A. Wertz G.W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a novel member of the disulfide-linked gH·gL complex, gO is unusual in that it is a viral envelope protein that does not need a transmembrane domain for membrane association. Covalent and/or noncovalent association with gH may suffice to tether gO to the viral envelope. Although we hypothesized, based on the amino acid sequence, that gO contained a membrane anchor, we addressed the question experimentally. One established method for separating integral membrane proteins from soluble, membrane-associated proteins involves washing vesicular membranes in alkaline carbonate. Alkaline treatment converts membrane vesicles into sheets, releasing ER and Golgi contents into the supernatant and leaving transmembrane proteins in the membrane pellet (24Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). From previous work, it is known that processing of gO in the ER occurs prior to its association with gH·gL complexes and that gO can be found as a monomer for several hours after synthesis (19Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3886-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that the subset of glycosylated gO that is not stably bound to gH·gL complexes may be the same portion that can be extracted from membranes by alkaline carbonate treatment. Results in Fig. 2 show that gO, when expressed alone, can be completely extracted from membranes. Our results suggest that alkaline carbonate extraction solubilizes proteins from membrane vesicles in a context-specific fashion. The implication of such selective extraction is that proteins, such as gO, that stably associate with integral membrane proteins via noncovalent or covalent interactions cannot be reliably analyzed by alkaline extraction alone. Faced with the experimental challenge of demonstrating the absence, rather than the presence, of a membrane-spanning domain, we created an epitope-tagged recombinant form of gO. The cumulative evidence from the His-tagged protein experiment and previous studies demonstrated that the signal peptide of gO is cleaved and that gO is a soluble protein. Thus, our working model of the gH·gL·gO complex asserts that glycoproteins H, L, and O are held in the viral envelope by the single transmembrane domain of gH (Fig. 7). We also know that assembly of the complex occurs sequentially in the ER and that gO acquires terminal modifications while traversing the Golgi en route to the cell surface (19Huber M.T. Compton T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3886-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known, however, where final envelopment of the virus occurs. The tripartite gH·gL·gO complex is unusual among viral fusion glycoproteins and has to date been studied only in HCMV. The gH and gL components of the complex have characterized homologs among all herpesviruses examined (31Grose C. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1991; 3: S960-S963Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Yaswen L.R.

Virol. 1998; 72: 8191-8197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycoproteins H and L are essential components of the virus (38Messerle M. Hahn G. Brune W. Koszinowski U.H. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 463-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are necessary for fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane (9Milne R.S. Paterson D.A. Booth J.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Baldwin B.R. Kleinberg M. Keay S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In contrast, recent work has shown that gO is not essential for viral replication in tissue culture but that a gO knockout virus has a severely attenuated phenotype (38Messerle M. Hahn G. Brune W. Koszinowski U.H. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 463-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary data from our laboratory also support involvement of gO in the fusion process, and studies are ongoing to elucidate the exact role that gO plays in viral entry and cell to cell spread of infection. The Herpesviridae are unique among viruses in the complexity of their glycoprotein coats. Thus, models of membrane fusion derived from single glycoprotein viral systems are of only moderate utility in our efforts to dissect the mechanisms of viral entry and cell to cell spread of HCMV. Perhaps more relevant are models of intracellular vesicle transport and membrane fusion, such as neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles. The multiprotein interactions between v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs as well as the sequential nature of membrane docking and fusion steps closely resemble the stages of HCMV fusion with host cell membranes (41Mochida S. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 36: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, the core fusion complex of SNAP-25/syntaxin is composed of an integral membrane protein, syntaxin, which targets SNAP-25 to membranes (42Vogel K. Cabaniols J.P. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several other proteins have been identified that bind to and positively or negatively regulate SNAREs in the neuron, including those proteins mediating calcium-triggered activation of fusion (41Mochida S. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 36: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 44Lao G.

Multiple additional proteins of uncharacterized function have also been identified in the envelope of HCMV (see Refs. 20Chee M.S. Bankier A.T. Beck S. Bohni R. Brown C.M. Cerny R. Horsnell T. Hutchison III C.A. Kouzarides T. Martignetti J.A. Preddie E. Satchwell S.C. Tomlinson P. Weston K.M. Barrell B.G. Curr. Topics Microbiol.

Examination of the mechanisms of intracellular membrane fusion may ultimately facilitate our understanding of the complex nature of HCMV-induced membrane fusion."

Although the proteins involved in establishing the replication forks are known, little is known about the events that ensure that initiation is bidirectional. We show here that in the absence of DNA gyrase, replication fork progression fromoriC on a plasmid template in vitro is unidirectional, although both replication forks have formed at the origin. There was no bias in the release of one fork or the other, ruling out protein blockage of one fork as a possible reason for the asymmetric release. Timely release of both forks required the presence of either DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV, suggesting that modulation of the topology of the origin region is the governing factor.

InEscherichia coli, replication from the origin has been reproduced in vitro using small plasmid DNA templates carrying the E. coli oriC (1Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). DnaA recognizes and binds to a number of repeated sequences in the minimal origin, “DnaA boxes” (2Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), organizing the origin DNA into a nucleoprotein structure that enables the interaction of some of the DnaA protomers with A + T-rich 13-mers that are just counterclockwise to the minimal origin. In the presence of the double-stranded DNA-binding protein HU, these 13-mers become denatured, presumably as a result of a weak affinity of DnaA for the single-stranded 13-mers (3Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once this region of localized denaturation is established, replication fork assembly can proceed, governed by a series of protein-protein interactions. DnaB, the replication fork DNA helicase, is transferred to the DNA at a stoichiometry of two DnaB hexamers per oriC(4Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) from DnaB-DnaC complexes in solution (5Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as a result of a protein-protein interaction between DnaA and DnaB (6Marszalek J. Kaguni J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once on the DNA, DnaB recruits DnaG, the Okazaki fragment primase, also via a protein-protein interaction (7Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to the DNA. This interaction determines where DNA replication will start and whether two replication forks will form (8Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27244-27248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Subsequent replication fork assembly requires the binding of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (pol III HE),1 the replicative polymerase, to the primers that are synthesized by DnaG. It is likely that the first primer synthesized by a DnaB-DnaG primosome moving in the clockwise direction away from oriC becomes the leading strand for the counterclockwise moving replication fork and vice versa. Subsequent replication fork establishment then requires the pol III HE synthesizing the leading strand moving in, e.g. the counterclockwise direction, to establish a protein-protein interaction with the DnaB that is moving in the same direction. The τ-subunit of the HE mediates this interaction (9Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 10Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Note that the DnaB that is presumably captured by protein-protein interactions by the HE moving, as a point of this illustration, in the counterclockwise direction is not the same DnaB that mediated an interaction with the primase to synthesize the primer for leading strand synthesis in that direction. Based on mapping of initiation points in the region of oriC, it has been suggested that the two DnaBs loaded to the chromosome must pass each other during establishment of the replication forks (4Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This description of the events during initiation of replication fromoriC proceeds under the tacit assumption that these events can account for both formation and release of two replication forks from the origin. We show here that this assumption is too simplistic. Whereas two replication forks do form at oriC in the presence of the proteins mentioned, DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, HU, and the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), timely release of both of these replication forks from the origin requires the presence of either DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV (topo IV). This requirement for a topoisomerase could reflect the formation of some type of a complex at the origin that is necessary for proper bidirectional replication. However, although we have been able to detect an interaction between DnaB and GyrB, we cannot detect one between DnaB and DNA gyrase. We therefore conclude that topological modulation of the origin region is necessary for timely release of both replication forks during initiation. Proteins fororiC replication, DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, HU, SSB, the DNA pol III HE (reconstituted from preparations of pol III* and the β subunit), topo IV, and DNA gyrase, were purified as described previously (11Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera to DnaB was described previously (12Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Antisera to GyrA and GyrB was raised in rabbits. E. coli DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and ligase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Tus was prepared as described by Hill and Marians (13Hill T.M. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2481-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Standard oriC DNA replication reaction mixtures (15 µl) were as described by Hiasa and Marians (11Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that incubation was at 37 °C. When present, DNA gyrase was at 30 nm, topo IV at 22 nm, Tus at 50 nm, DNA polymerase I at 19 nm, RNase H at 0.12 nm, and DNA ligase at 14 nm. Reactions mixtures that contained DNA ligase also contained 50 µmNAD. Template DNA was plasmid pBRTO1.2, a 6.7 kb-long molecule carrying two Ter sites, one 1.2 kb counterclockwise of the origin and the other 1.4 kb clockwise of the origin (Fig.1C). Gel electrophoretic analyses of replication products were performed as described previously (11Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins (5–6 µm) were mixed in buffer containing HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8) and 100 mm NaCl. Reaction mixtures (15 µl) were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (freshly diluted in 50 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.8) and 100 mm NaCl) was added to a final concentration of 0.004%, and the reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 1m glycine to a final concentration of 66 mm,and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. After addition of 25 µl of a 2× loading buffer (100 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 4% SDS), the samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and then chilled on ice for 5 min. Proteins were electrophoresed through a 6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at 220 V for 4 h and visualized by silver staining. For Western blotting, proteins were separated as described above except that the amount of protein loaded was reduced by half. Proteins were transferred overnight at 4 °C at 25 V onto nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against either DnaB or GyrB and were developed using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated system. Plasmid DNA templates carrying oriC that are replicated in vitro by a combination of DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, HU, SSB, and DNA gyrase produce replication products that are characteristic of bidirectional replication initiating at or near the origin sequence (Fig. 1A). On these templates, which are 6.7 kb in length (Fig. 1C), bidirectional replication produces two distinct populations of DNA when analyzed by denaturing alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.1A, lane 2) as follows: a leading strand population centered about 3 kb in length, indicative of the fact that the two replication forks that form at oriC meet roughly half-way around the template; and a lagging strand population centered about 0.5 kb in length. The addition of RNase H, DNA ligase, and DNA polymerase I (subsequently denoted RLP) to the reaction converts the products to full-length material (Fig. 1A, lane 3), indicating that the clockwise-moving leading strand could be ligated to the counterclockwise moving lagging strand on the same template molecule, for example (Fig. 1B). Circular nascent DNA is not observed because with gyrase as the only topoisomerase present, the bulk of the replicated DNA accumulates as a late replication intermediate, where there is still, on average, about 150 base pairs of unreplicated parental DNA (14Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11906-11917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that either topoisomerase III (15Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or IV (16Peng H. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8571-8575Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) is required to support the terminal stages of replication when the late intermediate is converted to two daughter molecules. In the absence of gyrase, initiation can occur because the template DNA is negatively supercoiled; however, replication fork progression proceeds only until it is inhibited by the accumulation of excess positive linkages in the template. The DNA product formed is called an early replication intermediate (ERI). We have shown that the ERI is a true kinetic intermediate in the replication pathway (15Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent completion of replication requires the release of the topological strain, which can be accomplished by either the addition of a topoisomerase or by cutting the template with a restriction enzyme. Leading strands present in the ERI are about 1 kb in length (Fig.1A, lane 1). At first glance, this size seems far too great. The plasmid template DNA contains about 40 negative supercoils; thus, if two replication forks formed and proceeded away from oriCin the ERI, one would expect the leading strands to be about 350 nucleotides in length, indicative of removal of the negative supercoils as the template was unwound as a result of replication, followed by generation of about 30 positive supercoils before replication ceased because of the accumulated topological strain. However, as we will show here, only one replication fork releases from the origin in the ERI, and as we have shown elsewhere (17McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8325-8340Google Scholar), origin-proximal regression of the nascent DNA in the ERI allows more fork progression than one would have predicted based on the superhelical density of the starting template DNA. That only one replication fork was active in the ERI is shown by the pulse-chase analysis displayed in Fig. 1A (lanes 4 and 5). Here the ERI was formed first and then the [α-32P]dATP was diluted out by a factor of 100 as the topological strain was released by the addition of eitherSmaI, a restriction enzyme that cuts the template DNA just to the left of oriC (Fig. 1C), or DNA gyrase. In each case the result was the same in that full-length DNA was the predominant product. If the ERI contained two paused replication forks with leading strands of about 1 kb, the final product length observed after the chase should have been somewhere intermediate between 5.7 and 3.3 kb. To investigate the possibility that only one replication fork was active in the ERI more closely, an assay was devised to score release of both replication forks on one DNA molecule. This assay used the same template DNA as in the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, but we now included the replication fork arrest protein Tus. This protein will bind to the Ter sequences that are present 1.2 kb counterclockwise and 1.4 kb clockwise of oriC. The basis of the assay is shown in Fig. 1D. If two replication forks initiated, released from the origin, and progressed to theTer sites, leading strands of 1.2 and 1.4 kb should be observed. In the presence of RLP, on any one molecule that has two active forks, the clockwise-moving leading strand should be joined to the counterclockwise-moving lagging strand, and vice versa, generating a 2.6-kb nascent DNA. If only one fork has released, the addition of RLP will not have any affect on the length of the nascent products. In the absence of gyrase, two populations of nascent DNA were observed as follows: a leading strand population centered about 1.2 kb in length and a smaller lagging strand population (Fig. 1E, lane 1). The length of the leading strand population argues strongly that on most template molecules only one fork had progressed. Bidirectional leading strand synthesis on one DNA template would have been expected to result in leading strands that were, at best, half of the observed length when the superhelical density of the template and nascent strand regression were factored in. The addition of Tus led to the production of leading strand DNA products of defined length (Fig. 1E, lane 3). However, in the presence of RLP, although ligation of the nascent lagging strand fragments together could be observed, in neither case were any products larger than 1.2–1.4 kb observed (Fig. 1E, lanes 2 and 4). On the other hand, when gyrase was present, the two defined leading strands were again observed in the presence of Tus, but now the addition of RLP converted the majority of the nascent DNA to a 2.6-kb product (Fig. 1E, comparelanes 5 and 6). The kinetics of fork release from the origin in the absence and presence of gyrase was investigated using the assay described above (Fig. 2). In the presence of gyrase, the 2.6-kb band could be detected within 1 min after the start of the reaction, whereas even after 15 min of incubation in the absence of gyrase only a small minority of the nascent DNA was converted to this product (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we conclude that in the absence of gyrase only one replication fork progresses to any significant extent. This is also supported by the observation that roughly twice as much DNA was synthesized in the presence of gyrase compared with the absence of gyrase (Fig. 2C). Even in the Absence of Gyrase, both Replication Forks Form at the Origin—We next investigated whether the reason that only one fork progressed in the ERI was because only one fork, rather than the two required for bidirectional replication, was initiated under the conditions used. To do so, we used pulse-chase analysis as described above, except that Tus was present from the beginning of the reaction so that the conditions of the assay described in Fig. 1Dapplied. Thus, the ERI was formed first in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. The label was then diluted out by the addition of a 100-fold excess of cold dATP at the same time that the topological constraint was released by adding either DNA gyrase orSphI, which cuts the template once outside of the region flanked by the Ter sites (Fig. 1C). In either case, the 2.6-kb product diagnostic of bidirectional replication formed (Fig. 3A) with the same kinetics (Fig. 3B). These observations indicate that during the initial incubation in the presence of the labeled dATP, both replication forks had, in fact, formed at the origin in the absence of gyrase. The fact that identical results were observed using either DNA gyrase or SmaI ruled out the possibility that, on any one molecule, nascent DNA made by one fork,e.g. the clockwise one, that had formed during the pulse-label became joined to nascent DNA made by a counterclockwise fork that had formed during the chase period. This is because initiation at oriC requires negatively superhelical DNA (15Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion by SmaI prevents subsequent initiation by relaxing the template. Thus, it seemed clear that the reason that both forks were not observed in Fig. 1A was that there was a delay in the release of one of the forks from the origin. Because the plasmid template is so small and the replication fork is known to move at roughly 1 kb/s, any delay in the neighborhood of 6 s will, in the absence of Tus, allow the first fork that released to transit all the way around the template before the release of the second fork. We conclude that gyrase is neither required for formation of replication forks during initiation nor for their progression. Timely Release of Both Replication Forks from the Origin Requires Modulation of Template Topology—We considered three possible reasons for the observed delay in release of both replication forks from oriC in the absence of gyrase: (i) that in fact both forks did release, but there was a roadblock on one side or the other and close to the origin that prevented progression of one of the forks; (ii) that an interaction between gyrase and one of the proteins of the replisome was required; and (iii) that it was release of topological strain across the origin that was the determining factor. Of course, a combination of these is also possible. To examine the possibility of blockage, we reasoned that such an event would be manifested as a bias in which of the forks appeared to release first. Indeed, cursory examination of the data in Figs. 1 and 2supports this idea, because there appears to be a bias for the release of the counterclockwise moving fork in the absence of gyrase. This possibility resonates with the fact that because initiation of both forks occurs just to the left of the origin, the clockwise-moving fork would have to presumably transit through the region of the template where DnaA was bound. This could cause significant delay. Indeed, in the λ replication system, such a delay appears to be caused by the λO protein bound to the origin (18Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine this possibility more closely, replication reactions were performed in the presence of Tus and in either the presence or absence of gyrase. The replication proteins were then inactivated by heating at 65 °C, and the DNA products were digested with either theEcoRI or SacII restriction enzymes, which cut the template once between the origin and the Ter sites in the counterclockwise and clockwise directions, respectively (Fig.4A). The amount of radioactivity in the bands at 1.2 and 1.4 kb was then determined. This restriction enzyme digestion was necessary to remove a background that complicates the analysis, i.e. in the absence of this digestion, for example, incomplete leading strands from the clockwise-moving fork that were in excess of 1200 nucleotides would appear to contribute to the amount of radioactivity on the gel that could be attributed to the counterclockwise-moving fork. The restriction enzyme digestion removes these leading strands from that region of the gel. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 4. In the presence of gyrase, the amount of radioactivity is roughly the same for each fork (Fig. 4, B and D). In the absence of gyrase, there is less than a 2-fold bias for the counterclockwise-moving fork at the earliest time points in the analysis (Fig. 4, C andE). We think that this is unlikely to indicate a significant bias in fork release because, as described above, the analysis is somewhat subjective with respect to how regions of the gel are chosen to represent one fork or the other and the data have not been normalized to the size of the DNA products (which would further reduce the apparent bias). If there actually were a 2-fold bias in fork release, we would have expected to observe a 2.6-kb band representing half the radioactivity in lanes 8–10 of Fig. 2A, for example. We therefore conclude that whereas there may be a slight bias to which fork releases in the ERI in the absence of gyrase, it is insufficient to account for the data shown in Figs. 1 and 2. We also considered that gyrase could be playing an architectural role at the origin, contributing to the formation of a replisome complex at the origin that was necessary for proper bidirectional replication. We reasoned that this might be manifested by protein-protein interactions between gyrase and a component of the replication fork. An examination by cross-linking using the bifunctional cross-linking agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate revealed an interaction between GyrB and DnaB (Fig. 5). Mixtures of these proteins at high concentrations (>1 µm) were treated with the cross-linking agent for 30 min and then analyzed by electrophoresis through 6.5% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. A silver-stained gel (Fig. 5A) as well gels that were Western-blotted using either anti-DnaB antisera (Fig. 5B) or anti-GyrB antisera (Fig. 5C) are shown. In each case, a band (labeled with an asterisk) could be detected with a mobility of about 220 kDa that was dependent on the presence of both GyrB and DnaB. This is a clear indication of an interaction between these two proteins. From the estimated size of the cross-linked band, we suspect that the molecular species involved are GyrB2 and DnaB3, and both forms are known to exist in solution. Although this is a promising and interesting observation, we have been unable to demonstrate an interaction between DnaB and native gyrase; thus, because we cannot eliminate the possibility that the interaction surface on GyrB is unavailable for DnaB when GyrB is formed into native gyrase, we cannot ascribe any significance to the observed interaction. To explore whether the requirement for gyrase for timely release of both replication forks from oriC related to timely modulation of the topology about the origin, we repeated the experiment described in Fig. 2 replacing gyrase with topo IV (Fig.6). Although topo IV cannot supercoil DNA as gyrase does, it will relax positive supercoils and can support replication fork progression (19Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16371-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that both replication forks released from the origin, allowing the formation of the 2.6-kb DNA fragment. Thus, we conclude that the observed requirement for gyrase for timely release of both replication forks from the origin relates to a requirement for topological modulation of the template DNA and is unlikely to be a specific requirement for the presence of gyrase itself. Replication of the E. coli chromosome occurs bidirectionally from oriC (20Prescott D.M. Kuempel P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2842-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Bird R.E. Louarn J. Martuscelli J. Caro L. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 70: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although this reaction has been reproduced in vitro, thus identifying the enzymes required, little is known of the molecular events that actually occur at the origin to ensure that two replication forks have formed and can proceed around the chromosome. In this report, we have shown that in the absence of topological modulation of the template DNA, even though two replication forks can be detected as having initiated at the origin, only one fork is released. Because the plasmid template DNA used in vitro is negatively supercoiled, we have been able to develop a pulse-chase protocol that allows us to observe the action of a particular set of replication forks. In this procedure, an ERI is formed by initiating replication in the absence of a topoisomerase. During this period [α-32P]dATP is included in the reaction. Replication fork progression proceeds in the ERI until excess positive supercoils have accumulated. These forks are stalled, but active, and replication fork progression can be resumed by the provision of either a topoisomerase or by cutting the template DNA with a restriction enzyme. In the latter run out, part of the procedure, excess unlabeled dATP is included to dilute the radioactive label. By using this procedure we have been able to show that either DNA gyrase (15Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), topo IV (19Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16371-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or topoisomerase III (15Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not topoisomerase I (15Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can support replication fork progression during θ-type DNA replication, for example. We had noted, however, that the replication run out product under these conditions was invariably full length. This suggested that only one replication fork was active in the ERI. If both forks were active, it would not be possible to observe a full-length leading strand DNA; instead, one would expect two half-length leading strands. To investigate this possibility further, we developed an assay that could definitively score bidirectional replication on the template DNA. This assay utilizes the replication fork arrest protein, Tus. Template DNAs were engineered such that the binding sites, Ter, for Tus were positioned close to and on either side of the origin in an orientation that would result in replication fork arrest in both directions when Tus was present. In addition, DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and DNA ligase were included in the reaction. This ensured that in the case of bidirectional replication, the leading strand that was being synthesized, e.g. in the clockwise direction from the origin, would be ligated with the Okazaki fragments being made in the counterclockwise direction from the same template strand. Thus, if these circumstances prevailed, a DNA fragment equal in length to the distance between the two Ter sites on the template would be produced. On the other hand, if one replication fork had moved clockwise on one template and another replication fork had moved counterclockwise on a different template, no such fragment could be generated. By using this assay, it was clear that only one replication fork had progressed to any significant extent in ERIs. Interestingly, however, it could be demonstrated that both replication forks had formed during initiation. We considered three possible explanations for these observations. One obvious possibility was that one of the replication forks was blocked and prevented from moving a significant distance because of DnaA bound to the origin. This is because initiation atoriC actually occurs in an A + T-rich zone just counterclockwise of the minimal origin sequence (4Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, the clockwise-moving fork has to transit across the origin, a region of DNA that is presumably bound to multiple DnaA molecules in a nucleoprotein-like, protein-DNA complex (22Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Indeed, during θ-type replication of plasmid templates carrying the bacteriophage λ origins of replication, such a blockage has been observed (18Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we obtained evidence for a slight bias in fork release in the anticipated direction, it could not account for the data. Another possibility that was considered was that formation of a replisome complex at the origin might require gyrase as a component, rather than require its activity as a topoisomerase, to be assembled correctly. This would be consonant with recent cell biological findingsin vivo in Bacillus subtilis (23Lemon K.P. Grossman A.D. Science. 1998; 282: 1516-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 24Lemon K.P. Grossman A.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1321-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) that suggest that replication of the chromosome occurs at a fixed point in the cell, where the template DNA is presumably drawn through a protein complex rather than the individual replication forks traversing each chromosome arm. Along these lines, we were able to demonstrate that one of the subunits of gyrase, GyrB, could be cross-linked to DnaB. However, a similar interaction between DnaB and native gyrase could not be demonstrated. Even so, if such an interaction occurred, we have no independent means for placing it at the origin. Thus, the possibility that a single replication factory synthesizes the DNA in a bacterial cell remains an attractive hypothesis. In fact, we could demonstrate that gyrase was neither required for the assembly of the two forks at the origin nor for timely release of both forks. Topo IV worked just as well. This observation leads us to the conclusion that we were observing a requirement for timely topological modulation of the template DNA that allowed both forks to proceed. We do not know what aspect of origin structure this topological modulation is required to relieve. One possibility is that as both forks proceed from the origin, negative supercoils might become trapped in the region between them, distorting the DNA and preventing elongation by the fork that released second. In support of this, we have also observed that inclusion of topoisomerase III, which will relax only negative, not positive, supercoils under these conditions, also allows both replication forks to proceed (data not shown)."
