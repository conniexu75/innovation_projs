TgCRND8 mice encode a double mutant form of amyloid precursor protein 695 (KM670/671NL+V717F) under the control of the PrP gene promoter. Thioflavine S-positive Aβ amyloid deposits are present at 3 months, with dense-cored plaques and neuritic pathology evident from 5 months of age. TgCRND8 mice exhibit 3,200–4,600 pmol of Aβ42 per g brain at age 6 months, with an excess of Aβ42 over Aβ40. High level production of the pathogenic Aβ42 form of Aβ peptide was associated with an early impairment in TgCRND8 mice in acquisition and learning reversal in the reference memory version of the Morris water maze, present by 3 months of age. Notably, learning impairment in young mice was offset by immunization against Aβ42 (Janus, C., Pearson, J., McLaurin, J., Mathews, P. M., Jiang, Y., Schmidt, S. D., Chishti, M. A., Horne, P., Heslin, D., French, J., Mount, H. T. J., Nixon, R. A., Mercken, M., Bergeron, C., Fraser, P. E., St. George-Hyslop, P., and Westaway, D. (2000)Nature 408, 979–982). Amyloid deposition in TgCRND8 mice was enhanced by the expression of presenilin 1 transgenes including familial Alzheimer's disease mutations; for mice also expressing a M146L+L286V presenilin 1 transgene, amyloid deposits were apparent by 1 month of age. The Tg mice described here suggest a potential to investigate aspects of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and therapy within short time frames.

It is characterized by cerebral amyloid deposits formed from the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ),1neuronal loss, and intracellular deposits denoted neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), aggregations of hyper-phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (τ). Genetic analyses of diverse familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) kindreds indicate biosynthesis of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), generated by secretase-mediated endoproteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is a common denominator in inherited forms of the disease. In the case of chromosome 21-linked FAD kindreds, mutations in APP are found in close proximity to the endoprotease sites where Aβ is excised by the action of β- and γ-secretases (2Citron M.

Saunders A.M. Srittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskell P.C. Small G.W. Roses A.D. Haines J.L.

These genetic data indicate elevated Aβ biogenesis or accumulation is likely a crucial pathogenic event in all forms of AD (i.e.both familial and sporadic AD). This conclusion finds a parallel in studies indicating that Aβ is neurotoxic (12Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A.

Such disease models have the potential to stratify pathogenic events and practical utility for testing interventions directed against synthesis or deposition of the Aβ peptide. However, despite intense effort, remarkably few models exist (reviewed in Ref. 15Hsiao K. Exp. Gerontol. 1998; 33: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Some models fail to produce APP and/or its metabolites by physiologically appropriate pathways, and in cases where this caveat does not apply, the transgenic animals may display only facets of the AD phenotype (16Janus C. Chishti M.A. Westaway D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). With regard to neuropathology, the phenotypes created thus far include amyloid deposits that closely resemble those seen in AD, selective neuronal loss (in one instance), some hyperphosphorylation of tau, but no deposition of NFTs (17Games D. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 18Hsiao K.H.

Neuropathological abnormalities in singly transgenic mice may not appear until 6–9 months of age and may not be robust until animals are well in excess of 1 year of age (see “Discussion”).

Transgene constructs were based upon a cDNA cassette encoding the major APP isoform in human brain, APP695. This cassette was modified to include either one or two FAD mutations: the “Swedish” mutation (K670N, M671L) and the “Indiana” mutation (V717F), lying adjacent to the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the APP Aβ domain, respectively. APPSwe and APPSwe+717 cDNAs were introduced into cos.Tet (29Scott M.R. Köhler R. Foster D. Prusiner S.B.

Microinjections into C3H/HeJ × C57BL/6J or (C3H/HeJ × C57BL/6J) × C57BL/6J oocytes (the strains are hereafter referred to as C57 and C3H) yielded a number of putative founders but just two stable transgenic lines designated Tg CRND6 and TgCRND8. These lines harbor APPSwe and APPSwe+V717F transgenes, respectively.Expression of APP and Aβ Peptide in TgCRND8 MiceAPP-specific antibodies were used to establish transgene expression from founder lines, with previously characterized TgAPPwt6209 transgenic mice providing a point of reference (22Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C. Yunis W. Xu S. Eckman C. Younkin S. Price D. Iadecola C. Clark H.B. Carlson G.A.

Use of the N-terminal antibody 22C11, which reacts with mouse and human APP, demonstrated overexpression of the full-length mature form of APP of ∼120 kDa and different lower molecular mass species of 100 kDa (which are not resolved in this gel system), including immature APP, and APP cleaved at the α- and β-secretase sites, APPSα and APPSβ (Fig.1 A). Overexpression in the TgCRND8 line relative to mouse APP holoprotein detected in non-Tg controls was estimated by quantitative image analysis at ∼5-fold. Similar results for high molecular weight APP species were obtained with antibody 369, which reacts with an epitope close to the C terminus of APP shared by mouse and human APP (Fig. 1 A). Lower molecular weight species deriving from APP processing were also observed in brain extracts of TgCRND8 and TgCRND6 mice analyzed with the human APP-specific monoclonal antibody 6E10 antiserum (epitope positioned N-terminal to the α-secretase cleavage site) and antibody 369. These polypeptides represent APP C-terminal stubs arising from cleavage at the α- and β-secretase sites, with antibody 369 recognizing both species and antibody 6E10 recognizing only the longer β-stubs. As anticipated, the APP6209 Tg line encoding wt human APP does not exhibit β-stubs (as it lacks the Swedish mutation that favors cleavage at this position) but exhibits α-stubs with a reduced electrophoretic mobility due to the inclusion of a c-Myc epitope tag within the C terminus of the APP cDNA cassette (22Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C. Yunis W. Xu S. Eckman C. Younkin S. Price D. Iadecola C. Clark H.B. Carlson G.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1203-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).In TgCRND8 mice, increasing levels of a 4-kDa species (but not β-stubs) were detected by Western blot analysis as the animals aged (Fig. 1 B). To investigate the composition of these 4-kDa Aβ peptide species, we performed ELISAs specific for Aβ40 and Aβ42. Both human Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detected in the brains of Tg CRND8 mice. No signals above background were detected in non-Tg animals. Levels of both peptides increased with age, although in different fashions (Table I). Thus Aβ40 levels were stable between 4 and 10 weeks of age. Aβ42 increased slowly between 4 and 8 weeks, with a potent increase at age 10 weeks, such that it predominated over Aβ40 by a ratio of ∼5:1. There was considerable spread in Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in 10-week-old mice, with levels of Aβ40 varying from 25 to 234 ng/g of brain and Aβ42 ranging from 115 to 728 ng/g of brain. The increase in Aβ42 and the sample-to-sample variation between mice at age 10 weeks likely represents a transition point as Aβ42, first present in soluble form, begins to assemble into insoluble amyloid deposits. Measured at 6 months of age, levels of both Aβ42 and Aβ40 were enormously increased and were ∼510 and 190 times, respectively, the levels observed in 4-week-old mice (which are free of amyloid plaque deposits; Fig. 5 A).Table IAβ peptide species in young TgCRND8 miceAgeGender 1-aUsing unpaired ttests, the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were not found to differ between males and females, from 4 to 8 weeks of age.Aβ42 1-bValues are expressed as nanograms of peptide per g of brain (wet weight) derived from duplicate or triplicate determinations of each animal.Aβ401-bValues are expressed as nanograms of peptide per g of brain (wet weight) derived from duplicate or triplicate determinations of each animal.Aβ42/Aβ40Mean ± S.D.RangeMean ± S.D.RangeMean ± S.D.weeks43F, 3M40.9 ± 4.135–4655.2 ± 3.649–600.74 ± 0.0464F, 3M55.3 ± 6.947–6361.3 ± 11.448–820.93 ± 0.1984F, 3M96.9 ± 56.359–21555.8 ± 4.846–631.07 ± 0.83109F, 1M298.1 ± 209.9115–72869.5 ± 61.125–2345.06 ± 1.56265M20,783 ± 659912,476–29,26010,584 ± 14959,262–13,1571.96 ± 0.591-a Using unpaired ttests, the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were not found to differ between males and females, from 4 to 8 weeks of age.1-b Values are expressed as nanograms of peptide per g of brain (wet weight) derived from duplicate or triplicate determinations of each animal.

Progeny of an F1 cross to the C3H/HeJ (“C3H”) strain were bred to mice derived from FVB/N and 129SvEv/Tac backgrounds. Estimated Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival curves for TgCRND8 mice and their littermates during post-natal development are presented in Fig.2. Inspection of the curves clearly indicates improved survival of mice with the APP transgene expressed on the (C57) × (C3H/C57) genetic background. In this cohort of Tg mice (n = 52), 20 mice died before the age of 120 days, decreasing their survival to 60% and with three deaths at 130 days and three further deaths after 250 days. When the APP transgene was expressed on either (C3H/C57/129SvEv/Tac) × (129SvEv/Tac) or (FVB) × (C3H/C57) genetic backgrounds (n = 12 andn = 41 respectively), survival dropped rapidly to 25–40% within the first 120 days of their post-natal life (Fig. 2). After this time point, survival with the (C3H/C57/129SvEv/Tac) × (129SvEv/Tac) genetic background dropped slightly to 33% (one death at 159 days) with only 25% (3 mice) of the cohort surviving until 365 days. Similarly, the survival of the TgCRND8 mice with (FVB)×(C3H/C57) background dropped rapidly within the first 120 days of post-natal age (Fig. 2) with 17% of mice (n = 7) surviving until 365 days of age. The survival of mice with the (C57) × (C3H/C57) was significantly better than survival of Tg mice with (FVB) × (C3H/C57) or (C3H/C57/129SvEv/Tac) × (129SvEv/Tac) backgrounds (Tarone-Ware statistics: 5.13, p < 0.05, and 19.01,p < 0.001, respectively). The survival curves of the latter two genetic backgrounds did not differ significantly from each other (Tarone-Ware statistics: 0.42, p > 0.05), and the survival of TgCRND8 mice with the three genetic backgrounds was significantly different from the survival of non-Tg littermates (Tarone-Ware statistics >50, all p values < 0.001.Figure 2Cumulative survival curves (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis) of TgCRND8 mice in different genetic backgrounds. Cumulative survival curves of TgCRND8 mice as a function of the transgene genetic background. The survival of Tg mice on the (C57) × (C3H/C57) genetic background (n = 52) was the highest, with 50% of mice surviving until 365 days of age (upper cut-off of the analysis). In contrast, the survival of the Tg mice on (C3H/C57/129SvEv/Tac) × (129SvEv/Tac) and (FVB)×(C3H/C57) backgrounds (n = 12 andn = 41 respectively) was affected by increased mortality within the first 120 days of their post-natal age. In the case of Tg mice with the (C3H/C57/129SvEv/Tac) × (129SvEv/Tac) genetic background, only 3 (25%) out of 12 mice survived until the age of 365 days, and only 17% (7 out of 41) of the (FVB) × (C3H/C57) Tg mice reached the age of 365 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although these data suggest significantly increased mortality of TgCRND8 mice as a consequence of a genetic contribution of 129SvEv/Tac or FVB mouse strains, some caveats have to be taken into consideration. First, the relatively small sample sizes of the studied cohorts, especially with the 129SvEv/Tac strain, where only a few mice survived for a long period, may not reliably reflect survival rates at later stages of life. The comparisons of larger cohorts should provide better estimation of survival curves. Second, future survival censuses must be extended to the pre-weaning developmental stage. The selective survival of pups before weaning, or for that matter at the pre-natal stage of development, may cause a bias of a particular cohort entering post-weaning stage. Also, the genetic composition of the particular outbred TgCRND8 parent might be a greater contributor to the differences in survival among the crosses than the composition of the inbred parent. Nonetheless, the major finding of the survival analysis, that the (C57) × (C3H/C57) genetic background significantly reduces mortality in TgCRND8 mice, is in accord with our starting hypothesis. Fifty percent of the studied cohort of 52 mice survived for a year with minimal mortality observed after the first 3 months of age. As shown in previous investigations, the cause of post-natal lethality was not obvious (22Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C. Yunis W. Xu S. Eckman C. Younkin S. Price D. Iadecola C. Clark H.B. Carlson G.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1203-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). No overt changes were revealed by routine histopathology, although it should be noted that seizures were observed in a small fraction of TgCRND8 animals, and APP transgenes have been correlated with altered vascular responses (37Iadecola C. Zhang F. Niwa K. Eckman C. Turner S.K. Fischer E. Younkin S. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K.K. Carlson G.A. Nat.

Pearson J. McLaurin J. Mathews P.M. Jiang Y. Schmidt S.D. Chishti M.A. Horne P. Heslin D. French J. Mount H.T.J. Nixon R.A. Mercken M. Bergereon C. Fraser P.E. St. George-Hyslop P. Westaway D. Nature. 2000; 408: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Here we present a characterization of a larger cohort of mice, and we include their behavioral analysis during NSP. The analysis showed that during NSP at age 10.5 weeks TgCRND8 mice performed comparably to non-Tg littermates when randomly searching the pool for a hidden platform. Escape latencies and lengths of search paths in the last trial of NSP for the groups were not significantly different (50.0 ± 7.3 versus 57.6 ± 8.8 s for latency and 961.1 ± 165.0 versus 1351 ± 247.4 cm for path-length, for the non-Tg and Tg mice, respectively). A “visible platform trial” administered during NSP, where the position of the submerged platform was marked by a striped beacon, also failed to reveal differences in performance between non-Tg and Tg groups. Average latencies to reach the cued platform were 9.9 ± 2.0 and 9.1 ± 1.6 s for non-Tg and Tg mice, respectively. The swim paths were 167.3 ± 16.1 cm for non-Tg and 153.1 ± 14.2 cm for Tg mice, and both groups had comparable swim speeds of 21.6 ± 1.4 and 20.2 ± 1.7 cm/s for non-Tg and Tg mice, respectively. In conclusion, these analyses showed TgCRND8 mice performed a random search comparable to non-Tg littermates when presented with the submerged platform and had similar swim paths to a visible platform when extra-maze distal spatial cues were occluded by a curtain.Water Maze, Reference Memory TestTgCRND8 mice at 11 weeks showed impairment in the acquisition of spatial information during place discrimination training. They had significantly longer escape latencies to reach the escape platform (Fig.3 A; F(1,15) = 17.98,p < 0.001) and longer search paths (F(1,15) = 15.91, p < 0.001). Both, Tg and non-Tg groups significantly improved during training (F(4,60) = 3.29,p < 0.02; F(4,60) = 3.33, p < 0.02, the latency and path, respectively), and no significant interaction between the groups and sessions was found in both measures. The concordance between measures of latency and search path is not surprising, because the TgCRND8 mice did not differ significantly from the non-Tg littermates in their swim speed during the test (F(1,15) = 2.53, p > 0.05). The pronounced spatial learning impairment of Tg mice was confirmed during the probe trial administered after the completion of training. They showed lower (t(15) = 2.99, p = 0.01) annulus crossing index (Fig. 3 B), searching the pool in a circular fashion and frequently crossing the centers of alternative quadrants (with an annulus crossing index approaching a zero value).Figure 3Reference memory version of Morris water maze test in TgCRND8 mice. A, at 11 weeks of age, experimentally naive TgCRND8 mice (N Tg = 10) show significant impairment in the acquisition of the spatial information relative to their non-Tg littermates (N non-Tg = 7). B, represents an annulus crossing index (the number of passes over the platform site in TQ, minus the mean of passes over alternative sites in other quadrants) during the probe trial administered after the last training trial of day 5. A positive index indicates selective focal search of the previous platform position, an index approximating zero reflects non-spatial or circular search of the pool. The TgCRND8 mice showed a significantly impaired (p < 0.01) spatial bias for the platform position as compared with their non-Tg littermates. *,p < 0"

In this report, using cDNA microarrays, we have focussed our attention on the characterization of extracellular matrix-related genes rapidly induced by TGF-β in human dermal fibroblasts and attempted to identify the ones whose up-regulation by TGF-β is Smad-mediated. For a gene to qualify as a direct Smad target, we postulated that it had to meet the following criteria: (1) rapid (30 min) and significant (at least 2-fold) elevation of steady-state mRNA levels upon TGF-β stimulation, (2) activation of the promoter by both exogenous TGF-β and co-transfected Smad3 expression vector, (3) up-regulation of promoter activity by TGF-β blocked by both dominant-negative Smad3 and inhibitory Smad7 expression vectors, and (4) promoter transactivation by TGF-β not possible inSmad3 −/− mouse embryo fibroblasts. Using this stringent approach, we have identified COL1A2, COL3A1, COL6A1, COL6A3, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-1 as definite TGF-β/Smad3 targets. Extrapolation of this approach to other extracellular matrix-related gene promoters also identified COL1A1 and COL5A2, but not COL6A2, as novel Smad targets. Together, these results represent a significant step toward the identification of novel, early-induced Smad-dependent TGF-β target genes in fibroblasts.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β is the prototypic fibrogenic cytokine, enhancing extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression and down-regulating that of matrix-degrading enzymes. Increased expression of TGF-β is often associated with fibrotic states and abnormal accumulation of ECM proteins in affected tissues (3Khalil N. Greenberg A.H. Ciba Found.

The ligand-specific Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad5 interact directly with, and are phosphorylated by, activated TGF-β receptors type I. Smad1 and Smad5 are specific for bone morphogenic proteins, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 can be activated by both TGF-β and activin receptors. Receptor-activated Smads are kept in the cytoplasm in the basal state bound to the protein SARA (Smad anchor forreceptor activation) (10Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation at their SSXS carboxyl-terminal motif, they are released from SARA and form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, a common mediator for all Smad pathways. The resulting Smad heterocomplexes are then translocated into the nucleus where they activate target genes, binding DNA either directly or in association with other transcription factors. Members of the third group of Smads, the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, prevent phosphorylation and/or nuclear translocation of receptor-associated Smads (7Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB.

Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). TGF-β also initiates other signaling pathways, such as the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (11Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This intracellular signaling proceeds through sequential activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEKK1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK4 or MKK7), and a mitogen-activated protein kinase, JNK. JNK then translocates into the nucleus where it phosphorylates several transcription factors including c-Jun, ATF-2, and Elk-1 (12Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar), leading to specific transcriptional responses. Although tremendous progress has been made over the past few years in the understanding of the molecular processes underlying TGF-β signal propagation by the Smad cascade, thus far, relatively few genuine mammalian Smad gene targets have been identified. Specifically, at present, only about a dozen genes are known to contain Smad-responsive regions, binding Smad complexes directly or indirectly. These genes include, in order of characterization as Smad targets, type VII collagen (COL7A1) (13Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Lechleider R.J Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. J. Biol.

Despite the fundamental role played by TGF-β in ECM remodeling and as a fibrogenic factor, little is known about the role of Smad signaling in ECM gene expression. In this report, we have used complementary techniques, differential hybridization of cDNA microarrays together with precise gene promoter analyses, to search for novel fibroblast Smad targets. This approach allowed us to characterize six novel Smad targets, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A2, COL6A1, COL6A3, and TIMP-1, and to propose an additional list of 49 immediate-early TGF-β target genes whose activation by TGF-β is rapid and does not require either protein neo-synthesis or JNK activity, therefore representing potential novel Smad targets.

Human recombinant TGF-β1 was from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Curcumin and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Total RNA from control and TGF-β-treated fibroblasts was obtained using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I to avoid genomic DNA contamination of reverse transcription reactions. Radioactive cDNA synthesis was carried out as described in the Atlas™ cDNA expression arrays user manual (CLONTECH, San Diego, CA). Equal amounts of33P-radiolabeled cDNAs (107 cpm) from control and TGF-β-treated fibroblast RNA samples were hybridized in parallel to Atlas™ human cell interaction cDNA expression arrays (catalog number 7746–1; CLONTECH) for 18 h at 68 °C. The filters were then washed four times in 2× SSC and 1% SDS for 30 min at 68 °C and twice in 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 68 °C, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Membranes were then exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. phosphor screens for 3 days. Hybridization signals were quantified with a Storm 840 phosphorimager using ImageQuant software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels in the same samples. Significant modulation of gene expression was set arbitrarily to 2-fold. Several ECM gene promoter/reporter gene constructs were used to examine the role played by TGF-β and Smad3 in their transcriptional activity.

Transient cell transfections were performed with the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation procedure. CAT activity was measured using [14C]chloramphenicol as substrate (40Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) followed by thin layer chromatography and quantitation with a phosphorimager. The technique of differential hybridization of cDNA expression arrays was used to identify differences in the expression pattern of 265 known ECM-related genes between control and TGF-β-treated fibroblasts. Because Smad activation and nuclear translocation occurs within minutes and Smad-DNA complexes can be observed as early as 10 min after TGF-β addition into fibroblast culture medium (13Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Lechleider R.J Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13053-13057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we focused our attention on early time points, to determine which genes are activated rapidly by TGF-β, as opposed to secondary gene activation that may involve protein/transcription factor neo-synthesis. At each of the time points tested (30, 60, 120, and 240 min), RNA was extracted from both control and TGF-β-treated fibroblast cultures, and differential hybridization of cDNA arrays was performed. Among the 265 genes whose probe sets are represented onto the Atlas™ cell interactions cDNA arrays used in these experiments, 77 of them showed no significant hybridization signal in either control or TGF-β-treated cultures at any of the time points tested (not shown). Among the 188 genes detected, 90 showed no or little alteration in their expression levels upon TGF-β treatment. The remaining 98 genes, modulated by TGF-β, were classified into clusters, based upon the temporal profile of their activation (Fig.1). Clusters 1–3 contain 58 genes whose expression is strongly up-regulated 30 min after TGF-β addition and keeps increasing with time (cluster 1), reaches a plateau (cluster 2), or returns rapidly to basal level (cluster 3). Clusters 4–6 comprise genes whose expression is delayed; their expression is not noticeably up-regulated by TGF-β at the 30-min time point and then follows various patterns of temporal regulation.

Note that clusters 1–3 contain genes whose expression is significantly upregulated by TGF-β after 30 min. Because our main aim was to identify immediate-early targets of the Smad pathway, genes induced as early as 30 min post-TGF-β addition to the cultures were further studied in experiments in which on-going protein synthesis is blocked by cycloheximide. Analysis of gene expression by differential hybridization of cDNA arrays indicated that, at the 30-min time point, a similar set of 58 genes was induced by TGF-β in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, consistent with a transcriptional response not requiring on-going protein synthesis, such as expected from direct Smad targets. It should be noted that a broad increase in gene expression induced by cycloheximide alone was also observed (not shown), a phenomenon that has been previously described (41Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C.F. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Hudson Jr., J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). In the presence of curcumin, an inhibitor of JNK activity (42Chen Y.R. Tan T.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), only three genes among the 58 identified above and belonging to clusters 1–3 were not stimulated by TGF-β after 30 min, fibronectin, perlecan, and closely related low density lipoprotein receptor (43Murdoch A.D. Dodge G.R. Cohen I. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8544-8557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has have been shown previously that fibronectin gene activation by TGF-β is a JNK-dependent mechanism that does not require the Smad pathway (44Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the inhibitory effect of curcumin observed in our experiments. Regarding perlecan, we have shown previously that its up-regulation by TGF-β is mediated by transcription factor NF-1 and not by Smads (45Iozzo R.V. Pillarisetti J. Sharma B. Murdoch A.D.

Inversely, we found that genes previously identified as Smad targets, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (14Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar), COL1A2 (17Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest.

Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), the latter detected in another set of experiments using different cDNA microarrays (catalog number 7741–1; CLONTECH, not shown), also belong to these early-induced gene clusters. Together, these data provide a strong argument for the specificity of our experimental approach and its appropriateness for the characterization of early-induced TGF-β/Smad targets. We next tried to determine whether the rapid elevation of steady-state mRNA levels observed for several ECM-related genes upon TGF-β stimulation, as observed using differential cDNA array hybridization, resulted from transcriptional activation at the level of their promoter regions. We focused our attention on the 5′ regulatory regions of COL1A2, COL3A1, COL6A1, COL6A3, and TIMP-1 genes, which all belong to clusters 1 and 2, corresponding to genes whose expression is enhanced at least two times by TGF-β within 30 min. In a first set of experiments, TGF-β responsiveness was examined. All promoter constructs tested responded to exogenous addition of TGF-β by a 3–5-fold elevation of their activity (Fig. 2 A). As a first approach to determine whether these promoters were sensitive to Smad activation downstream of TGF-β, co-transfection experiments were performed in which each ECM promoter/CAT reporter construct was co-transfected with a Smad3 expression vector. As shown in Fig.2 B, Smad3 overexpression led to significant up-regulation of each of the promoters tested, indicating that the Smad pathway may be involved in the TGF-β effect. If the Smad cascade is responsible for the up-regulation of a given gene by TGF-β, then the expression of either a dominant-negative Smad3 or inhibitory Smad7 should block its activation by TGF-β. To test this hypothesis, all promoter constructs shown above to respond to both TGF-β and Smad3 overexpression (see Fig. 2) were co-transfected with either Smad3ΔC or Smad7 expression vector. In both cases up-regulation of promoter activity by TGF-β was blocked (Fig. 3), suggesting that the COL1A2, COL3A1, COL6A1, COL6A3, and TIMP-1 genes are immediate-early targets of the TGF-β/Smad3/4 signaling cascade. It may be extrapolated, although it remains to be investigated precisely, that most genes identified in clusters 1–3 whose mRNA steady-state levels were elevated at least two times by TGF-β after 30 min, but whose 5′-end regulatory regions were not analyzed functionally for Smad responsiveness, also represent direct Smad targets. Because both COL6A1 and COL6A3 were characterized as direct Smad targets (see above), we wanted to determine whether COL6A2, which encodes the α(2) chain of heterotrimeric type VI collagen, was similarly up-regulated by TGF-β. Interestingly, when a 2.5-kilobase pair COL6A2 promoter fragment (24Kardassis D. Pardali K. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41405-41414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was tested in an identical experimental system, we observed that it did not confer either TGF-β or Smad3 responsiveness (not shown), suggesting a differential regulation of the three genes encoding type VI collagen by TGF-β, where both COL6A1 and COL6A3 are coordinately regulated and are direct Smad targets, whereas COL6A2 is not. These data differ slightly from previous observations indicating specific up-regulation of COL6A3 but not COL6A1 or COL6A2 by TGF-β, when mRNA steady-state levels were detected after 48 h of stimulation (46Heckmann M. Aumailley M. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). mRNA steady-state levels of COL1A1, which encodes the α(1) chain of type I collagen, have been shown previously to be elevated by TGF-β (47Varga J. Rosenbloom J. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The corresponding promoter was found to be up-regulated by both exogenous addition of TGF-β and co-transfection of a Smad3 expression vector (not shown). In addition, its activation by TGF-β was blocked by both dominant-negative Smad3 and Smad7 overexpression (not shown), indicating that the COL1A1 promoter is also a Smad target. Interestingly, these data corroborate the previously described coordinate regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2 (48Sandmeyer S. Gallis B. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5022-5028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Cockayne D. Cutroneo K.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2736-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 50Hata R. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1995; 19: 735-741Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and indicate transcriptional coordination by TGF-β, orchestrated by Smad-dependent mechanisms. Identical results were obtained with the α(2) type V collagen gene (COL5A2) promoter, indicating that the latter is also a direct Smad target (not shown). To ascertain the role played by Smad3 in the transactivation of the ECM-related promoters identified above, transient cell transfection experiments were carried out using either wild-type or Smad3 −/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (26Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.L. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). As expected from the data presented above in which either dominant-negative Smad3 or inhibitory Smad7 expression vectors blocked TGF-β effect, no TGF-β-driven transactivation of the COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A2, COL6A1, COL6A3, and TIMP-1 promoters was observed in Smad3 −/− mouse embryo fibroblasts. On the other hand, all promoters add their activity significantly increased by TGF-β in the corresponding wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (not shown). These results confirm the role played by Smad3 to mediate TGF-β transactivation of these ECM promoters. The implication of TGF-β in fibrotic processes has long been suspected (3Khalil N. Greenberg A.H. Ciba Found. Symp. 1991; 157: 194-207PubMed Google Scholar, 4Border W.A. Noble N.A.

Phys. 2000; 47: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The demonstration that several genes encoding fibrillar collagens, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, and COL5A2, are up-regulated by TGF-β acting directly through the Smad pathway indicates that the latter is likely to play a key role in the development of tissue fibrosis. It also suggests that therapeutic approaches directed toward the Smad cascade may prove useful in the treatment of fibrotic disorders. In conclusion, using cell matrix interaction-specific commercial cDNA microarrays we have identified 58 immediate-early targets for TGF-β. Only three of these 58 genes had their activation blocked by curcumin, a selective inhibitor of JNK, a signaling pathway alternative to the Smad cascade downstream of the TGF-β receptors. These data suggest that the JNK pathway downstream of the TGF-β receptors likely affects very few early ECM-related target genes as compared with the Smad pathway. Using promoter/reporter gene constructs to analyze the transcriptional responsiveness to the TGF-β/Smad pathway of several genes identified by differential hybridization of cDNA arrays, we have formally identified six novel TGF-β/Smad immediate-early gene targets, namely COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A2, COL6A1, COL6A3, and TIMP-1. Together with the identification of 49 other immediate-early TGF-β gene targets, this study represents a major leap forward in the identification of TGF-β/Smad targets.

Genes involved in biosynthesis of these compounds are grouped on a 50-kilobase fragment of the chromosome containing 13 genes. Analysis of mRNA produced from this 50-kilobase fragment in the wild type strain showed that this region is subdivided into three transcriptional units. Biochemical characterization of five mutants with transposon insertions in this region demonstrated that (i) the complete DIM molecules are synthesized in the cytoplasm of M. tuberculosis before being translocated into the cell wall; (ii) the genesfadD26 and fadD28 are directly involved in their biosynthesis; and (iii) both the drrC andmmpL7 genes are necessary for the proper localization of DIMs. Insertional mutants unable to synthesize or translocate DIMs exhibit higher cell wall permeability and are more sensitive to detergent than the wild type strain, indicating for the first time that, in addition to being important virulence factors, extractable lipids of M. tuberculosis play a role in the cell envelope architecture and permeability.

Despite its tremendous importance as a public health problem, the molecules involved in the pathogenicity of the tubercle bacillus remain largely unknown. The mycobacterial cell envelope has long been thought to be involved in both the pathogenicity of these bacteria and their resistance to hostile environments and antibiotics. In addition to its postulated passive role through a strong resistance to degradation by host enzymes, impermeability to toxic macromolecules, and inactivation of small reactive molecules, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen derivatives, the mycobacterial cell envelope may exert a more active role, notably by interacting with host cell receptors to facilitate uptake of the bacterium and by modulating the immune response (1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mycobacterial envelope is unique, both in molecular composition and in the architectural arrangement of its constituents. From the cytoplasm to the external side of the bacterium, the cell envelope is composed of: (i) a plasma membrane; (ii) a cell wall consisting of a peptidoglycan covalently attached to the heteropolysaccharide arabinogalactan, which is in turn esterified by very long chain (C60–C90) fatty acids called mycolic acids and various noncovalently attached lipids and glycolipids; and (iii) a capsule of polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids (1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the last 50 years, considerable effort has been devoted to searching for putative virulence factors among constituents of the mycobacterial cell envelope. Two structurally related families of noncovalently attached cell wall and capsular lipids, phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol diesters (Fig. 1), have retained special attention. These complex lipids are composed of a mixture of long chain β-diols, which are esterified by multimethyl-branched fatty acids. Depending on the stereochemistry of the chiral centers bearing the methyl branches, the fatty acids are called mycocerosic or phthioceranic acids (2Asselineau J. Indian J. Chest Dis. 1982; 24: 143-157Google Scholar, 3Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar). Phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM)1 and diphthioceranates have been identified to date in eight mycobacterial species. DIM have been found in M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium gastri, and Mycobacterium kansasii, and phthiocerol diphthioceranates have been found in Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium ulcerans. With the exception of M. gastri, all of the DIM- or phthiocerol diphthioceranate-containing species are mycobacterial pathogens (3Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a DIM-less H37Rv-derived strain of M. tuberculosishas been shown to be attenuated in the guinea pig model in comparison with the DIM-producing H37Rv strain (4Goren M.B. Broki O. Schaefer W.B. Infect. Immun. 1974; 9: 150-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, an avirulent strain of M. tuberculosis coated with a mixture of DIM and cholesteryl oleate has been shown to persist longer than the uncoated strain in the spleen and lungs of infected mice (5Kondo E. Kanai K. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1976; 29: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, all of this evidence is indirect, and there has been no direct demonstration that these molecules are involved in pathogenicity. With recent advances in the molecular biology of mycobacteria, the biosynthesis of these lipids has been shown to involve at least seven genes in M. bovis BCG. Five of these genes,ppsA–E, encode a type I modular polyketide synthase responsible for the synthesis of phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol by elongation of a C20–C22 fatty acyl chain or an acyl chain containing a phenol moiety with three malonyl-CoA and two methylmalonyl-CoA units (6Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Fernandes N.D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16741-16745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Another gene, mas, encodes an iterative type I polyketide synthase that produces mycocerosic acids after two to four rounds of extension of C18–C20 fatty acids with methylmalonyl-CoA units (7Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Mathur M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19388-19395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the fadD28 gene (also namedacoas) has been shown to encode an acyl-CoA synthase that is thought to be involved in the release and transfer of mycocerosic acid from Mas onto the diols (9Fitzmaurice A.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8033-8039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Genome sequencing of M. tuberculosis has revealed that these seven genes are clustered on a 50-kb fragment of the chromosome containing six other open reading frames (ORF): three ORF (drrA, drrB, anddrrC) encoding polypeptides very similar to ABC transporters, another ORF (mmpL7) encoding a transporter of the RND permease superfamily (10Tseng T.-T. Gratwick K.S. Kollman J. Park D. Nies D.H. Goffeau A. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 107-125PubMed Google Scholar), one ORF encoding an acyl-CoA synthase (fadD26), and the final ORF (papA5) encoding a protein of unknown function (see Fig. 2) (11Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas III, S. C. E.B. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T.

We recently searched for the virulence factors of M. tuberculosis by applying the Signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis method to mycobacteria. We isolated four different insertions in the 50-kb region, which led to a strong growth defect in lungs of intravenously infected mice in comparison with the wild type parental strain. In these mutants, transposon insertions occurred upstream from fadD26 and within fadD26,drrC, or mmpL7 (12Camacho L.R. Ensergueix D. Perez E. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). A similar approach using the Erdman strain of M. tuberculosis also led to the isolation of attenuated mutants with an insertion upstream from fadD26and within fadD28 and mmpL7, confirming that the 50-kb region is important for the virulence of M. tuberculosis (13Cox J.S. Chen B. McNeil M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). No DIM production was observed in thefadD26 and fadD28 strains, whereas themmpL7 insertional mutant of the Erdman strain appeared to synthesize this molecule but was defective in its secretion (13Cox J.S. Chen B. McNeil M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to dissect the 50-kb region and to obtain further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of DIM in the virulence of M. tuberculosis. The transcriptional organization of this 50-kb region was studied. We analyzed the production and subcellular localization of DIM in five different strains with transposon insertions in this region. We found that both DrrC and MmpL7 were involved in the proper localization of DIM in the cell envelope and demonstrated that, in addition to the covalently bound mycolic acids, DIM are involved in the cell wall permeability barrier of M. tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis Mt103, the wild type strain used in this study, was isolated from an immunocompetent tuberculosis patient (14Jackson M. Phalen S.W. Lagranderie M. Ensergueix D. Chavarot P. Marchal G. McMurray D.N. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2867-2873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains MYC2251 to MYC2261 were isolated using the Signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis procedure, as previously described (12Camacho L.R. Ensergueix D. Perez E. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Mol.

MYC2253, MYC2260, MYC2261, and MYC2267 harbor insertions within the fadD26,mmpL7, drrC, and fadD28 genes, respectively. Strain MYC2267 was obtained by PCR screening of our 6912 insertional mutant library as described by Jackson et al.(15Jackson M. Raynaud C. Lanéelle M.-A. Guilhot C. Laurent-Winter C. Ensergueix D. Gicquel B. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The occurrence of an IS1096::kminsertion within fadD28 in MYC2267 was confirmed by PCR using primers fadD28C3 and fadD28S3, which are specific forfadD28, and primers IS1 and IS2, which are specific for IS1096::km (TableI). The use of the two fadD28-specific primers in a PCR reaction gave a 1882-bp fragment with the wild type strain Mt103, whereas no PCR fragment was obtained with MYC2267. In contrast, DNA fragments of the expected size were amplified if IS1 and fadD28C3 or IS2 and fadD28S3 were used (data not shown). The IS1096::km insertion site was sequenced and found to be located 460 bp downstream from the predicted start codon of the fadD28 gene.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for MYC2267 characterization, RT-PCR analysis, and construction of pLCF26, pLCF28, and pLCDCPrimerNucleotide sequence (5′ → 3′)Annealing temperature used°CTranscriptional couplingfC26CGCAGTGCCCGACGACATCA65fD26GTCGAGTGAGTTCCGGGCAC65ppsA1GCCGAGAGGTCGGTGTGATGC55ppsB1AGCATTCGCTGCTGCGGGTCC55ppsB7AATGACCGCAGCGACACCAGATCG55ppsC6TAGCCGGCCCGCCAGCGTGAGCAT55ppsCATGACAAGTCTGGCGGAGCGCGCG55ppsD5TCCGGTGCTCAGGTACGGGTCGAT55ppsD11CGGCGGGTGACCTCGGCG66ppsE12CGCCCGCGTCCTCGAGCG66ppsE1TACAGTTCGACTCGGACATGACGC60drrA1GACTTGCTCAGTCCCCACAGACGA60drrA2GTGCCCCGCGATCTGAAGGATCTG60drrB2CCATCGGACTGGACTGAAACCGAC60drrB3CTGTAAAGCTGTTTCCGCACTGGA60drrC3GCGACAAAAGTTGACCCAGTGATC60pap1GATTCAGCCGTTCGTCGCCC60pap2TCCAGAGTGCAGCAGGTCGTC60f28CCGCGGGCGCTGCCGCGGCGATCTCG68mmpL7.3CCCACGTGGCGGGTGTCGGCGCGC68Characterization of MYC2267IS1CTTCTGCAGCAACGCCAGGTCCACACT60IS2GAGGCGGCAGAAAGTCGTCAGGTCAG60fadD28S3ATGGTGGACCCATGGCGAGCC60fadD28C3GGACTAGTCTAGGCATCCAAGCGGGCGAA60Construction of pLCF26f26C1GACTAGTCCGGCATCGCACACG60f26C2GACTAGTTACGGCTACGTCCAG60Construction of pLCF28f28C1GACTAGTCCGGTGTTACCCGAC62f28C3GGACTAGTCTAGGCATCCAAGCGGGCGAA62Construction of pLCDCdrrC1CGGGATCCATGATCACGACGACAAGT63drrC4GTTCTGCAGATGCGTGCTGGCCCG63 Open table in a new tab Strains were grown on Sauton medium as surface pellicles, Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with ADC (0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.0003% beef catalase), and 0.05% Tween 80 where indicated or on solid Middlebrook 7H11 medium (Difco) supplemented with OADC (0.005% oleic acid, 0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.085% NaCl, 0.0003% beef catalase). Kanamycin was added when required at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. M. tuberculosiscultures (10 ml) were grown to mid-exponential growth phase. Bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 ×g, resuspended in 1 ml of TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) containing lysozyme (5 mg/ml), and incubated for 20–30 min at 37 °C. Cells were disrupted by adding 500 μl of mini glass beads (0.1 mm in size; PolyLabo) and vigorous shaking for 3 min using a mini bead beater. Total RNA was then extracted using the RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen). Contaminating DNA was removed by digestion with DNase I according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This enzyme was removed by extractions with two chloroform/isoamylic alcohol followed by ethanol precipitation. RNA (1 μg) and oligonucleotide primer were denatured by heating to 65 °C for 10 min. Reverse transcription was performed with the ExpandTM reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 μl of RNase inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 50 units of reverse transcriptase, and the manufacturer's buffer (provided with the enzyme). This mixture was incubated for 55 min at 43 °C, and the enzyme was inactivated by heating for 2 min at 95 °C. A control reaction containing the same components but no reverse transcriptase was included to check for DNA contamination. The cDNA products (2 μl) were then used in a PCR reaction performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2 units of Amplitaq Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10% Me2SO, and 15 pmol of each primer. A positive control in which M. tuberculosischromosomal DNA was used as a template for the PCR reaction was included. The amplification program consisted of one cycle of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at annealing temperature (depending on the primer used (Table I)), 1 min at 72 °C, and a final 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were then analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels. The identities of the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid pMIP12 is an Escherichia coli/mycobacteria shuttle vector derived from pAL5000. It contains a mycobacterial promotor, pBlaF*, upstream from a multicloning site followed by a transcription terminator. 2Le Dantel, C., Winter, N., Gicquel, B., Vincent, V., and Picardeau, M. (2001) J. Bacteriol. 183,2157–2164. A 1.6-kbBamHI fragment containing the hygromycin resistance gene (hyg) was blunt-ended and inserted into the blunt-endedNsiI + DraI-digested pMIP12 vector to give rise to pMIP12H. The drrC gene was amplified from cosmid MTCY19H9 (11Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas III, S. C. E.B. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D.

The 830-bp PCR product was digested withBamHI and PstI and inserted into theBamHI + PstI-cut pMIP12H vector leading to give pLCDC. In this construct, the predicted start codon of drrCis located 6 bp downstream from a Shine-Dalgarno sequence and is under the control of the mycobacterial promotor pBlaF*.

Badell, J. Moniz-Peirein, B. Cicquel, and N. Winter, manuscript in preparation.Transformation of M. tuberculosis strains with this plasmid leads to integration of the entire plasmid into the alaVgene. This plasmid carries the hygromycin resistance gene,hyg, a multicloning site (containing a singleSpeI restriction site) flanked by two transcription terminators, and an origin of replication for E. coli. A 2168-bp fragment was produced by PCR amplification from cosmid MTCY338 using the primers f26C1 and f26C2 (Table I). It contained the predicted fadD26 gene and the 287-bp sequence located upstream from fadD26 and downstream from Rv2929. This fragment was digested with SpeI and inserted into theSpeI site of pOIP23H to give plasmid pLCF26. Similarly,fadD28 (1740 nucleotides) and the intergenic sequence upstream from fadD28 (620 nucleotides) were amplified from cosmid MTCY24G1 using primers f28C1 and f28C3. The amplicon was digested with SpeI and cloned into pOIP23H to give pLCF28. The integrity of genes drrC, fadD26, andfadD28 was checked by sequencing. Bacterial pellicles from 200 ml of 20-day cultures in Sauton medium were used for the isolation of DIM for structural analysis. Cells were collected by pouring off the medium and were inactivated by heating at 95 °C for 2 h. Bacterial pellicles were left in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1 v/v) at room temperature overnight, and lipids were extracted twice with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1 v/v), concentrated under vacuum, washed three times with water, and dried. This crude lipid extract was subjected to chromatography on a Florisil (60–100 mesh) column and was eluted with increasing concentrations of diethyl ether (0, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100%) in petroleum ether. The DIM content of each fraction was determined by TLC on silica gel G 60 plates (20 × 20 cm; Merck) using petroleum ether/diethyl ether (9:1 v/v) as the eluent. Lipid compounds were visualized by spraying the plates with 10% phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol and heating. The DIM-containing fractions (10% diethyl ether in petroleum ether fractions) were pooled, dried, and subjected to chromatography on another Florisil column. Increasing concentrations of diethyl ether (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 50%) in petroleum ether were used as eluents to obtain the various members of the DIM family (e.g.dimycocerosates of phthiocerol A (DIMA), dimycocerosates of phthiocerol B (DIMA′), and dimycocerosates of phthiodiolone (DIMB); Fig. 1). Samples of purified DIM (2 mg) were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer equiped with an Aspect X32 computer. The samples were dissolved in CDCl3 (99.96 atom % D) and analyzed in 200 × 5-mm 535-PP NMR tubes. One-dimensional1H spectra were recorded at 295 K; 1H chemical shifts were expressed with respect to the internal CHCl3(at 7.27 ppm). Purified DIM samples were also analyzed by mass spectrometry with a linear mode of detection using a VOYAGER DE-STR MALDI-TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). DIM (1 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution) was mixed with 0.5 μl of the matrix solution. The mass spectra were mass assigned using an external calibration. The matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml) in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1 v/v). The two constituents of DIM, mycocerosic acid residues and phthiocerol and related substances, were structurally characterized as their methyl and O-methylated derivatives, respectively, using the conventional Hakomori procedure. Briefly, 200 μg of DIMs were dissolved in dimethylsulfinyl potassium in dimethyl sulfoxide (200 μl), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. A large excess of CD3I (100 μl) was then added, and the reaction was left for 2 h and stopped by adding 1 ml of H2O and sodium thiosulfate. Fatty acid trideuteriomethyl esters and per-O-deuteriomethylated substances of the phthiocerol family were extracted with CHCl3, washed with water, dried under nitrogen, and dissolved in diethyl ether prior to analysis by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC was performed on a Girdel series 30 apparatus equipped with an OV1 capillary column (0.30 mm × 25 m) using helium gas (0.7 bar) with a flame ionization detector at 310 °C. The temperature separation program involved an increase from 200 to 310 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min, followed by 10 min at 310 °C. GC-MS analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5889 X mass spectrometer (electron energy, 70 eV) coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph fitted with a similar OV1 column (0.30 mm × 12 m). GC-MS analyses were performed in both electron impact and chemical ionization modes; in the latter mode, NH3 was used as the reagent gas. We determined the distribution of DIMs in the various cell fractions ofM. tuberculosis using labeled cultures; 20 μCi of sodium [1-14C]propionate (specific activity, 55 Ci/mol; ICN) was added to 100 ml of 16-day cultures of the wild type and insertional mutants of M. tuberculosis that were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h with continuous shaking. Cultures were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 × g, and culture supernatants were filtered twice through membranes with 0.2-μm pores (Millipore) to remove contaminating cells and concentrated to one-tenth of their initial volume. Half of each bacterial pellet was gently shaken with 10 g of glass beads (4-mm diameter) for 30 s, resuspended in 10 ml of H2O, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 ×g. Supernatants were filtered through membranes (0.2-μm pores) to yield the surface-exposed materials (17Ortalo-Magné A. Lemassu A. Lanéelle M.-A. Bardou F. Silve G. Gounon P. Marchal G. Daffé M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Mini glass beads (500 μl; PolyLabo) and 1 ml of H2O were added to the remaining half of each bacterial cell that was disrupted using a mini bead beater for 3 min. Bacterial extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g to eliminate intact cells, and supernatants were recentrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 ×g. The 15,000 × g supernatants corresponded to cytoplasmic and cell membrane components, whereas the corresponding pellets contained mainly cell envelope components. These pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of H2O, and the second washing and the other fractions were kept for isocitrate desydrogenase (ICD) activity assays to check for contamination with cytoplasmic compounds. This enzyme assay was performed as previously described (18Raynaud C. Etienne G. Peyron P. Lanéelle M.-A. Daffé M. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using a 100-μg protein equivalent of each fraction. The fractions were first sterilized by filtration through membranes (0.2-μm pores); protein concentration was then determined using the Coomassie Blue reaction (Bio-Rad protein assay). We checked for contamination with the extracellular fraction by performing Western blot analysis as previously described using 30 μg of proteins of the various fractions and antiserum raised against the Erp protein (19Berthet F.-X. Lagranderie M. Gounon P. Laurent-Winter C. Ensergueix D. Chavarot P. Thouron F. Maranghi E. Pelicic V. Portnoı̈ D. Marchal G. Gicquel B. Sciences. 1998; 282: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In M. bovis BCG, it was found that in liquid medium without Tween, most of the Erp protein was present in the supernatant. 4L. Mendonza-Lima, personal communication. All of the extracts were inactivated by incubation for 2 h at 95 °C before extraction with organic solvents for lipid analysis. Lipids were extracted from the various cell fractions by adding 2 volumes of CH3OH and 1 volume of CHCl3 to 0.8 volume of a given fraction to yield a homogeneous one-phase mixture. The mixture was incubated for 2 h and then partitioned into two phases by adding 1 volume of H2O/CHCl3 (1:1 v/v). The organic phase was recovered, washed twice with water, and dried to yield the subcellular lipid extracts. The various extracts were dissolved in CHCl3 to give a final lipid concentration of 20 mg/ml. Equivalent volumes of each extract were deposited on silica gel G 60 plates (20 × 20 cm; Merck), which were run in petroleum ether/diethyl ether (9:1 v/v). 14C-Labeled lipids were detected by scanning chromatograms with a Berthold LB 2832 TLC linear analyzer. The total number of counts per min recovered in the region corresponding to DIM on TLC was used to determine the amount of DIM in the portion of each fraction analyzed and, consequently, in the whole bacterial compartment of each mycobacterial strain examined (expressed as relative percentages). The drug sensitivity of the wild type strain and its isogenic insertional mutants was determined as described previously (15Jackson M. Raynaud C. Lanéelle M.-A. Guilhot C. Laurent-Winter C. Ensergueix D. Gicquel B. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Permeability assays were performed using M. tuberculosis cells in the exponential phase of growth, as described previously (15Jackson M. Raynaud C. Lanéelle M.-A. Guilhot C. Laurent-Winter C. Ensergueix D. Gicquel B. Daffé M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Cells were first labeled by incubation for 16 h with [5,6-3H]uracil (2 × 10−5m, 1.85 TBq mmol−1) in Middlebrook 7H9 medium to quantify the biomass present in the aliquots used in the accumulation assays. They were then collected by centrifugation and washed with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Aliquots of labeled cells were counted, dried, and weighed to correlate3H labeling with cell dry weight. Assays of accumulation of [14C]chenodeoxycholate (2 × 10−5m, 1.8 GBq mmol−1; purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were performed under continuous agitation. M. tuberculosisprecultures were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in 7H9 supplemented with ADC and kanamycin (when necessary) and centrifuged, and the cell concentrations were adjusted to allow the inoculation of 10-ml cultures at a final A600 nm of 0.02 with 100 μl of bacterial suspension. For assays of resistance to RNI, NaNO2 (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1 or 5 mm, and the pH was adjusted to 5.5. The effect of this pH itself on growth of the various M. tuberculosis strains was monitored by inoculating the standard medium adjusted to pH 5.5 without NaNO2. Cultures were incubated for 10 days, and aliquots were collected after 0, 1, 4, and 10 days of growth. The number of bacteria was evaluated by plating serial dilution on 7H11 medium. For assays of resistance to detergent, SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.01, 0.04, or 0.1%. Cultures were incubated for 9 days, and aliquots were collected after 0, 1, 4, and 9 days of growth. The number of viable bacteria was evaluated by plating serial dilutions on 7H11 medium. In silicoanalysis of the 13 different ORF present in the 50-kb fragment (Fig.2) showed that ORF fadD26 topapA5 were all transcribed in the same orientation and that, based on their predicted start codons, several of these ORF overlapped (11Cole S.T.

Overexpression of Bcl-2 prevents cytochrome c release, without ameliorating ATP depletion or Bax translocation, with little or no association between Bcl-2 and Bax as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (Saikumar, P., Dong, Z., Patel, Y., Hall, K., Hopfer, U., Weinberg, J. M., and Venkatachalam, M. A. (1998) Oncogene 17, 3401–3415). Now we show that translocated Bax forms homo-oligomeric structures, stabilized as chemical adducts by bifunctional cross-linkers in ATP-depleted wild type cells, but remains monomeric in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. The protective effects of Bcl-2 did not require Bcl-2/Bax association, at least to a degree of proximity or affinity that was stable to conditions of immunoprecipitation or adduct formation by eight cross-linkers of diverse spacer lengths and chemical reactivities. On the other hand, nonionic detergents readily induced homodimers and heterodimers of Bax and Bcl-2. Moreover, associations between translocated Bax and the voltage-dependent anion channel protein or the adenine nucleotide translocator protein could not be demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of Bax, or by using bifunctional cross-linkers. Our data suggest that the in vivo actions of Bax are at least in part dependent on the formation of homo-oligomers without requiring associations with other molecules and that Bcl-2 cytoprotection involves mechanisms that prevent Bax oligomerization.

How cytochrome c leaves mitochondria during apoptosis after relocation of Bax to the mitochondrial outer membrane still remains an unanswered puzzle. Potential mechanisms involve mitochondrial swelling caused by opening the permeability transition pore in the inner membrane (17Petit P.X. Goubern M. Diolez P. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) or by mitochondrial hyperpolarization followed by swelling and membrane rupture (18Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that the pro-apoptotic proteins Bid and Bax can release cytochromec from isolated mitochondria in the absence of detectable mitochondrial swelling (19Kluck R.M. Esposti M.D. Perkins G. Renken C. Kuwana T. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldberg M. Allen T. Barber M.J. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although it was believed earlier that Bax induces the release of cytochrome c by inhibiting Bcl-2 function through binding of the Bcl-2 homology domains BH1, BH2, and BH3, there is evidence to suggest that Bax and Bcl-2 function independently in regulating apoptosis (20Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31482-34188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Formation of ion channels in synthetic lipid bilayer by members of the Bcl-2 family (22Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) has suggested that pro-apoptotic members may rearrange in the outer mitochondrial membranes to allow the efflux of cytochrome c by forming large channels. Even though both Bcl-2 and Bax are capable of forming ion channels in artificial membranes, it is unclear how these proteins can form similar channels and still exert opposing actions. The data would suggest that Bax function can be inhibited by Bcl-2/ Bcl-xL, but does not require direct Bax/Bcl-2 or Bax/Bcl-xL interaction for regulating Bax function (23Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C.

A. 1997; 94: 11357-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). For example, enforced dimerization of Bax, as a chimeric protein with FK506 binding protein, resulted in its translocation to the mitochondria and induced cell death even in the presence of Bcl-xL (25Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Likewise, Bax mutant proteins that fail to bind to Bcl-2 are capable of inducing apoptosis (20Zha H. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31482-34188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, Youle's group (26Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) have shown that nonionic detergents induce Bax homo- and heterodimerization with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL and suggested that such simple dimers alone are not sufficient to regulate apoptosis. Bax has recently been reported to interact directly with VDAC1 on the outer membrane to release cytochrome c or with ANT on the inner membrane to initiate the permeability transition, indirectly leading to cytochrome c release (27Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 28Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that Bax may cause instability in artificial lipid membranes, suggesting another mechanism by which Bax may permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane (29Basanez G. Nechushtan A. Drozhinin O. Chanturiya A. Choe E. Tutt S. Wood K.A. Hsu Y. Zimmerberg J. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5492-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A caveat in this model is that Bcl-xL, which is known to block cytochrome crelease from intact mitochondria, did not prevent the membrane-destabilizing effects of Bax. We have been investigating the roles played by Bax and Bcl-2 in the regulation of cytochrome c release from mitochondria in a model of apoptotic cell death induced by cellular ATP depletion. We have shown previously that severe ATP depletion of cultured rat kidney proximal tubule cells induced by hypoxia or chemical inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration triggers the translocation of cytosolic Bax to mitochondria and cytochrome c release into the cytosol (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this model, mitochondrial insertion of Bax does not compromise the integrity of inner mitochondrial membranes (14Saikumar P. Dong Z. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3341-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, the outer mitochondrial membrane would appear to be a reasonable site for the permeabilizing actions of Bax, at least in the context of hypoxia. Using this model, we now report that, following insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane, Bax oligomerizes to form a multimeric structure that could explain the release of cytochrome c. We also show that the protective actions of Bcl-2 may stem from its ability to block Bax oligomerization in the mitochondrial outer membrane without forming physical complexes with the Bax protein. Materials purchased from vendors were as follows. Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal antibodies to rat Bax (1D1) were kindly provided by Dr. Richard J. Youle (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and polyclonal antibody to rat adenine nucleotide translocator was provided by Dr. H. H. Schmid (Hormel Institute, Austin, MN).

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and preadsorbed secondary antibodies to mouse and rabbit were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (Westgrove, PA). Rat kidney proximal tubule cells (RPTC; SKPT-0193 clone 2), and human Bcl-2-overexpressing RPTC (Bcl-21) were described before (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Membrane grade Triton X-100 and digitonin were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Other detergents and chemical cross-linkers disuccinimidyl tartarate, disuccinimidyl glutarate, DSP, DTSSP, DTBP, EGS, DPDPB, and SANPAH were purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were of the highest grade available. Cells were cultured in serum-supplemented Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 17.5 mmglucose as described (30Woost P.G. Orosz D.E. Jin W. Frisa P.S. Jacobberger J.W. Douglas J.G. Hopfer U. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 125-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and plated at 105cells/cm2 in 60- or 100-mm collagen-coated dishes. After overnight growth, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to ATP depletion by incubation in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (in mm: 115 NaCl, 1 KH2PO4, 4 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 1.25 CaCl2, and 25 NaHCO3; pre-gassed with 95% N2, air, and 5% CO2) containing 15 μm CCCP at 37 °C under normoxic conditions. Glycine was included at 5 mm in the buffer to simulate glycine contents of tissues in vivo (31Nissim I. Weinberg J.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 684-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Duran M.A. Spencer D. Weise M. Kronfol N.O. Spencer R.F. Oken D.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1990; 105: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), thus preventing early necrotic injury during incubation (33Venkatachalam M.A. Weinberg J.M. Hochachka P.W. Lutz P.L. Sick T. Rosenthal M. van den Thillart G. Surviving Hypoxia. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 473-494Google Scholar). Cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared by selective plasma membrane permeabilization with digitonin (34Fiskum G. Craig S.W. Decker G.L. Lehninger A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3430-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), followed by membrane solubilization. Briefly, control and experimental cells in dishes were treated with 0.05% digitonin in isotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4; ∼ 107cells/ml) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 50 μm bestatin, 15 μm E-64, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A), for 1–2 min at room temperature. Cell permeabilization by digitonin was standardized by measuring 100% release of lactate dehydrogenase and was also monitored visually under an inverted microscope. The permeabilized cells were shifted to 4 °C, scraped with a rubber policeman, and collected into centrifuge tubes. The supernatants (Dig/Cytosol) were routinely collected after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Following centrifugation, the pellet was further extracted with ice-cold detergent (1% Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100 or CHAPS) in buffer A containing protease inhibitors for 60 min at 4 °C to release membrane- and organelle-bound proteins including mitochondrial cytochrome c. Both detergent-soluble (membrane) and insoluble fractions were collected by low speed (15,000 ×g) or high speed (500,000 × g) centrifugation. The protein patterns of soluble membrane fractions, after low or high speed centrifugation, both by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were indistinguishable. Therefore, solubilized membrane fractions were routinely collected by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. The relative protein levels of Dig/Cytosol, membrane- and detergent-insoluble fractions are 58 ± 4%, 15 ± 0.5%, 27 ± 4% for control, and 48 ± 6%, 14 ± 0.5%, 38 ± 6% for ATP-depleted cells (4 h CCCP), respectively (data from four independent experiments). Subcellular fractionation of cells was also achieved by Dounce homogenization in isotonic Buffer B (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) and differential centrifugation yielding nuclear (500 ×g pellet), mitochondrial (15,000 × gpellet), microsomal (500,000 × g pellet), and cytosol (500,000 × g supernatant) fractions. Unbroken cells constituted <1%, as monitored by light microscopy with trypan blue. Unlike control cells, ATP-depleted cells contained large numbers of altered mitochondria that sedimented with nuclei. In order to make valid comparisons, nuclear and mitochondrial fractions were collected together as 15,000 × g pellet. Protein concentration was estimated with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) reagent (Pierce) following supplier's protocol using bovine serum albumin as standard. All cross-linkers were dissolved in Me2SO just before using. Cross-linkers were added at 1 mm (0.1 mm for SANPAH) concentration to intact cells (∼2 × 106 cells equivalent to 1 mg of total protein), cells permeabilized with digitonin or detergent extracts of membrane. Optimal cross-linking conditions for cytosol and membrane extracts were determined after testing different cross-linker to protein ratios. 1 mm concentration of all cross-linkers except for SANPAH (0.1 mm) was found to be optimal for a range of protein concentrations (100–500 μg) in the extracts. After the addition of cross-linkers, cells or extracts were incubated on a head-to-head rocker for 30 min at room temperature. Amine targeting cross-linkers (NHS esters and imido esters) were quenched by adding 0.1 volume of 2m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and incubated with rocking for another 30 min at room temperature. Sulfhydryl targeting cross-linker DPDPB was removed from cells by washing the pellets or from extracts by protein precipitation with 3% trichloroacetic acid or 80% acetone. In case of SANPAH, all the incubations were carried at 4 °C with 20 min of incubation to react NHS esters and 10 min of exposure to UV light (360 nm) to generate the nonspecifically reactive nitrenes. After cross-linking, cytosol and membrane fractions from intact cells were collected as described above. Cleavage of -S–S-bridge-containing cross-linkers was achieved by incubating extracts with 50 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C. Proteins were resolved by non-reducing or reducing (50 mm DTT) SDS-PAGE in Xcell II mini cell on 10% or 4–12% (gradient) NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen, CA) using MES or MOPS running buffer as recommended by the manufacturer. After electrophoresis, proteins from the gel were electroblotted onto 0.2-μm PVDF membranes following manufacturer's directions. Western blotting using appropriate primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated suitable secondary antibodies was performed to analyze proteins. Chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce) were used to detect antigen-antibody complexes on the PVDF membrane. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as follows. Solubilized extracts in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer A with protease inhibitors) were pre-cleared by mixing with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (1:1 diluted suspension) for 1 h at 4 °C, and beads were removed by centrifugation. The resultant supernatants were incubated with primary antibodies (2 μg of antibody) at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight. Immunoprecipitates were collected by incubating with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h, followed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with lysis buffer three times, followed by three washes with same buffer containing 500 mmNaCl to increase stringency and reduce nonspecific binding of proteins to immunoprecipitates. In some cases, high salt washes were omitted deliberately to preserve proteins in immunoprecipitates that might have associated nonspecifically or with weak affinity. After final wash, the protein G-Sepharose beads with immunoprecipitates were suspended in SDS/sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. For IEF, a 6% acrylamide (30% acrylamide, 1.8%N,N-methylene bisacrylamide) slab gel was prepared with 7.5% Ampholine (1:1 (v/v) mix of ampholytes pH 3.5–9.5 and pH 5.0–8.0; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 1% CHAPS in a gel cassette. Cytosol and membrane extracts with or without cross-linking were applied to IEF gels as follows. Protein samples (10–30 μg) were diluted with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (40 mmarginine, 40 mm lysine, 30% glycerol) and were applied on top of the gel. The gel was focused for 1 h at 100 V, 3 h at 200 V, and 0.5 h at 500 V using anode (7 mm phosphoric acid) and cathode (20 mm arginine, 20 mmlysine) buffers at room temperature. Proteins in IEF gels were electroblotted onto a 0.2-μm PVDF membrane for 1 h in 0.7%(v/v) acetic acid, pH 3.0, and were detected by appropriate antibodies. The pH gradient on the IEF gel was determined either by surface electrode or by pH measurement of deionized water eluate of focused gel slices (0.5-cm width). We have shown previously that cultured rat kidney proximal tubule cells express high concentrations of Bax, which is localized in the cytosol (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). ATP depletion by either hypoxia or treatment with CCCP in the absence of glucose causes Bax translocation to mitochondria and cytochrome c release into cytosol (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Provision of growth medium after hypoxia or chemically induced ATP depletion allows resynthesis of ATP by glycolysis and causes apoptotic death in cells with cytosolic cytochrome c (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, Bax is predominantly cytosolic in control cells (>99% soluble) and migrates to membranes (mitochondria) in ATP-depleted cells (>90% membrane-bound; Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and 3). The relative percentages of soluble and membrane-bound Bax in control and ATP-depleted RPTC were determined by densitometric analysis of chemiluminescence signals on films after Western blotting. From several experiments, we found that, after 4 h of ATP depletion, the average amount of Bax translocated to membranes varies from 80% to 100% of total. The zwitterionic detergent CHAPS extracted membrane-inserted Bax almost as efficiently (>95%) as nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 (Fig. 1 A, see lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 6 and7). Digitonin-released cytosol collected after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min (Fig.1 A, lane 2) or 500,000 ×g for 15 min (Fig. 1 A, lane 5) contained the same amount of Bax, although total protein was marginally reduced by 12 ± 3% (four independent determinations) after 500,000 × g centrifugation. These results further confirmed the soluble nature of Bax protein in normal cells and validated the use of digitonin to obtain cytosol from whole cells. Double immunostaining, using an anti-Bax antibody and an antibody to cytochrome oxidase, a mitochondrial marker, revealed that the localization of Bax coincided exactly with that of cytochrome oxidase during ATP depletion, showing that Bax translocates exclusively to the mitochondria (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In accordance with our earlier results, Bax and cytochrome oxidase were shown in the current study to be present in different fractions in normal cells but co-localized to the same fractions in ATP-depleted cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3). In order to assess Bax translocation by conventional cell fractionation, Dounce homogenization followed by differential centrifugation was carried out. Control cells provided clean fractions of nuclei, mitochondria, microsomes, and cytosol. Integrity and specificity of mitochondrial fractions were confirmed by the presence cytochrome c (data not shown). Interestingly, although mitochondria appeared filamentous in normal cells, they were round and aggregated around the nucleus in ATP-depleted cells (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATP depletion has changed the shape and densities of mitochondria. The modified shape and densities of mitochondria posed a challenge in obtaining clean mitochondrial fractions in ATP-depleted cells. Therefore, mitochondria and nuclei were collected together to assess Bax translocation. Together with our previous immunocytochemical observations showing that nuclei of ATP-depleted cells are devoid of Bax and that the protein is visualized exclusively in mitochondria (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), these fractionation studies provided good evidence that Bax translocates to mitochondria, but not nuclei or the microsomal membranes during ATP depletion (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6). Based on these results, we routinely used the crude membrane fractions that remained after the removal of digitonin-released cytosol to assess Bax localization. Separate studies showed that membrane bound Bax was efficiently extracted with detergents, and remained in the supernatants to the same extent regardless of whether the extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g or 500,000 × g. Thus assay of detergent extracts of the crude membrane fraction represented a valid method to assess Bax in mitochondrial membranes. Double immunostaining using anti-Bax and anti-cytochrome c antibodies revealed that, in 100% of the cells with Bax in mitochondria, a diffuse cytosolic cytochrome c staining was observed, whereas cells with Bax in cytosol displayed a filamentous mitochondrial staining (1Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Data presented in Fig. 1 C confirm these published observations and show that, after Bax translocation, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into the cytosol. Although the Bax molecule has mitochondrial targeting signals in its sequence, it remains u"

In the present studies we demonstrate that these isoenzymes show high GPx activity toward phospholipid hydroperoxides (PL-OOH) and they can catalyze GSH-dependent reduction of PL-OOH in situ in biological membranes. A major portion of GPx activity of human liver and testis toward phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PC-OOH) is contributed by the Alpha class GSTs.

Treatment with 30 μmH2O2 for 48 h or 40 μmPC-OOH for 8 h causes apoptosis in control cells, whereas hGSTA2-2-overexpressing cells are protected from apoptosis under these conditions. In control cells, H2O2 treatment causes an early (within 2 h), robust, and persistent (at least 24 h) activation of JNK, whereas in hGSTA2-2-overexpressing cells, only a slight activation of JNK activity is observed at 6 h which declines to basal levels within 24 h. Caspase 3-mediated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage is also inhibited in cells overexpressing hGSTA2-2. hGSTA2 transfection does not affect the function of antioxidant enzymes including GPx activity toward H2O2 suggesting that the Alpha class GSTs play an important role in regulation of the intracellular concentrations of the lipid peroxidation products that may be involved in the signaling mechanisms of apoptosis.

Although the mechanisms of H2O2- and 4-HNE-induced apoptosis are not completely understood, there appear to be some common features associated with the apoptotic signaling pathways during H2O2- and 4-HNE-induced apoptosis. For example, activation of the stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (SAPK/JNK), increased phosphorylation of c-Jun, activation of caspase 3 (CPP32) and degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) have been shown to be associated with apoptosis induced by both H2O2 (7DiPietrantonio A.M.

These observations raise obvious questions about the possible involvement of LPO products in the mechanisms of apoptosis and suggest the possibility that LPO products generated during oxidative stress may be involved in the signaling mechanisms of H2O2-induced apoptosis.In aerobic organisms, ROS are continually generated, and during oxidative stress caused by stimuli such as infection and exposure to xenobiotics, their overproduction causes various deleterious effects including increased LPO. In order to protect against these harmful ROS, aerobic organisms have developed a number of cellular defenses (17Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). The antioxidant defense system may be considered to be composed of non-enzymatic and enzymatic components. The low molecular weight antioxidants including vitamins A and E, ascorbate, urate, and GSH comprise the non-enzymatic component, although the antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) comprise the enzymatic component. Among the enzymatic mechanisms, GPxs (EC 1.11.1.9), which provide defense against ROS-mediated LPO, play an important role in protection mechanisms against oxidative stress. At least four selenium-dependent GPx isoenzymes designated as cellular GPx (GPx-1) (18Mills G.C. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1986; 251: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have been characterized in mammalian tissues. Among these isoenzymes, only GPx-4, which is associated with membranes, can use phospholipid hydroperoxides (PL-OOH) as substrates, and the in situ reduction of PL-OOH in biological membranes by GPx-4 has been demonstrated (24Urisini F.

Chem. 1990; 265: 454-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In addition to the selenium-dependent GPx activities, mammalian cells also have selenium-independent GPx activity displayed by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs, EC 2.5.1.18). GSTs, which belong to a supergene family of phase II detoxification enzymes, are involved in the conjugation of a wide range of electrophilic xenobiotics, including carcinogens and mutagens, to the endogenous nucleophile GSH (26Mannervik B.

At least six gene families coding for the Alpha, Mu, Pi, Theta, Kappa, and Zeta class GSTs have been reported in humans (27Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

The selenium-independent GPx activity of GSTs toward organic hydroperoxides was first characterized in rat liver (31Prohaska J.R. Ganther H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 76: 437-445Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and in humans, this activity was shown to be predominantly expressed by the cationic GSTs (32Awasthi Y.C. Dao D.D. Saneto R.P. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which belong to the Alpha class (33Mannervik B. Alin P. Guthenberg C. Jensson H. Tahir M.K. Warholm M. Jornvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

J. 1997; 325: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Both GSTA1-1 and GSTA2-2 can utilize fatty acid hydroperoxides (FA-OOH) as well as PL-OOH as substrates (35Zhao T.J. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J.Z. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, neither the GSH-dependent reduction of PL-OOH by GSTs in biological membranes in situ has been demonstrated nor has the physiological significance of the GPx activities of hGSTA1-1 and hGSTA2-2 been systematically investigated. A subgroup of the Alpha class GSTs having substrate preference for 4-HNE is also present in mammals including humans (36Zimniak P. Singhal S.S. Srivastava S.K. Awasthi S. Sharma R. Hayden J.B.

Therefore, the present studies were designed to elucidate the role of the Alpha class GSTs in the protective mechanism against LPO. In the studies presented in this communication, we have first assessed the capability of recombinant hGSTA1-1 and hGSTA2-2 for GSH-dependent reduction of PL-OOH (GPx activity) in biological membranes in situ, and we examined the effect of overexpression of hGSTA2-2 in human erythroleukemia cells (K562) on LPO during oxidative stress. We then examined the role of hGSTA2-2 overexpression in the mechanisms of H2O2-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. Results of these studies demonstrate for the first time that hGSTA1-1 and hGSTA2-2 can reduce PL-OOH in the biological membranes in situ and that the overexpression of hGSTA2-2 protects K562 cells from H2O2-induced LPO and cytotoxicity. More importantly, our results show that the transfection of K562 cells withhGSTA2 attenuates H2O2-induced apoptosis by suppressing SAPK/JNK activation and caspase 3-mediated PARP cleavage.DISCUSSIONThe role of GSTs in detoxification of electophilic xenobiotics including carcinogens through the conjugation of these electrophiles to GSH is well established (26Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 27Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 205-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of selenium-independent GPx activity of GSTs, primarily associated with the Alpha class isoenzymes hGSTA1-1 and hGSTA2-2, is not clear, and systematic studies in this area are lacking. In this communication, we provide strong evidence for an important role of the Alpha class GST isoenzymes, hGSTA1-1 and hGSTA2-2, in the protection mechanisms against LPO. Our results demonstrate that (i) these isoenzymes show high GPx activities toward the physiological substrates, PL-OOH generated during LPO; (ii) GSH-dependent reduction of PL-OOH by these isoenzymes occurs in biological membranesin situ; (iii) overexpression of hGSTA2-2 attenuates LPO in K562 cells under normal conditions as well as during oxidative stress; and (iv) overexpression of hGSTA2-2 in K562 cells attenuates the cytotoxic effects of H2O2 and other oxidants and protects against H2O2-induced apoptosis by blocking SAPK/JNK and caspase 3 activation.Previous studies have suggested that GST-catalyzed GSH-dependent reduction of PL-OOH requires the prior release of FA-OOH by phospholipase A2 (64Tan K.H. Meyer D.J. Belin J. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Later studies in our laboratory have suggested, however, that intact PL-OOH can be used as substrates by the Alpha class GSTs (40Singhal S.S. Saxena M. Ahmad H. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our present results show that both recombinant hGSTA1-1 and hGSTA2-2 have relatively high activity toward PL-OOH (Table I). Consistent with the results of our previous studies (35Zhao T.J. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J.Z. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), these results show that a prior release of FA-OOH from PL-OOH is not a prerequisite for the GSH-dependent reduction of PL-OOH by the Alpha class GSTs. GSTs are cytosolic enzymes, which raises the question whether these enzymes can catalyze the reduction of PL-OOH in situ in the biological membranes and, if so, how? By using two independent approaches to quantitate the reduction of PL-OOH in erythrocyte membranes, we demonstrate for the first time that the Alpha class GSTs can indeed catalyze the GSH-dependent reduction of PL-OOH present in biological membranes (Fig. 1 and Table II). The specific activities of hGSTA2-2 toward membrane PL-OOH derived from both approaches are similar, indicating the validity of these methods. However, the specific activity of hGSTA2-2 toward the membrane PL-OOH is remarkably lower than that toward the isolated PL-OOH. This may not be surprising because the steric factors may limit the access of the enzyme to membrane PL-OOH. The k cat (0.94 s−1) of hGSTA2-2 for membrane PL-OOH calculated from data in Table II is low. However, GSTs are known for their low catalytic efficiency which is compensated by their unusually high cellular abundance (65Jakoby W.B. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 46: 383-414PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms through which presumably cytosolic GSTs catalyze the reduction of membrane PL-OOH using GSH, a hydrophilic co-substrate, are not known and should be elucidated.We have shown previously that the cationic Alpha class GSTs including hGSTA1-1 and hGSTA2-2 are not expressed in K562 human erythroleukemia cells (41Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Saini M.K. Cheng J.Z. Awasthi Y.C. Awasthi S. Biochem. Arch. 1999; 15: 163-176Google Scholar). These cells therefore provide a suitable model for studying the protective role of GSTs against oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate the attenuation of LPO in K562 cells overexpressing hGSTA2-2. Similar protection was observed in cells overexpressing hGSTA1-1 (data not presented). Under normal physiological conditions, cells overexpressing hGSTA2-2 showed a lesser extent of LPO as compared with the wild type and vector-transfected cells. This protection was much more pronounced in cells subjected to oxidative stress by including 100 μm H2O2 and traces of Fe2+ in the medium (Fig. 5). These results strongly support the role of the Alpha class GSTs against LPO caused by oxidative stress because the levels of the antioxidant enzymes and those regulating GSH homeostasis remain unaltered in the transfected cells. Furthermore, hGSTA2-2 shows no detectable GPx activity toward H2O2 (Table I) suggesting that the protective role of GSTs against LPO is attributed to their ability to reduce PL-OOHs which propagate the autocatalytic chain of LPO through continuous generation of free radicals. The functional relevance of the GPx activity of GSTs toward PL-OOH appears to be relatively more important to liver as opposed to other tissues because of the relatively higher oxidative stress in this organ due to ROS generated during the metabolism and the biotransformation of xenobiotics by the cytochrome P-450 system. The Alpha class GSTs constitute the bulk of GST protein of liver which has been estimated to be about 3–5% of the total soluble proteins of this organ (28Awasthi Y.C. Sharma R. Singhal S.S. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Rowe J.D. Nieves E. Listowsky I. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Our results show that more than half of the total GPx activity of liver toward PL-OOH is contributed by the Alpha class GSTs. In the majority of the extrahepatic tissues such as brain, lung, heart, and pancreas where hGSTP1-1 which does not show that GPx activity is the predominant GST isoenzyme (28Awasthi Y.C. Sharma R. Singhal S.S. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), only a minimal GPx activity due to GSTs is observed. However, in testis, a major portion of GPx activity toward PL-OOH is contributed by GSTs. Testes are rich in the Alpha class GSTs (28Awasthi Y.C. Sharma R. Singhal S.S. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Rowe J.D. Nieves E. Listowsky I. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and it may be necessary to protect this tissue from ROS-induced damage. The importance of GSTs in the protection against oxidative stress in testes is underscored by recent studies showing that GST activity of germ cells is increased upon H2O2 exposure, and the inhibition of GSTs leads to enhanced LPO (66Rao A.V. Shaha C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).The pro-oxidants, including H2O2, are known to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell lines (1Nomura K.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6380-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The role of H2O2 and ROS in general in the mechanism of apoptosis is suggested by a number of studies showing that the stimuli promoting apoptosis also lead to increased formation of H2O2 and ROS (4Jing Y.

However, the mechanisms of H2O2-induced apoptosis and the involved signaling pathway are not completely understood. Results of our TUNEL assay (Fig. 7) and DNA laddering (Fig. 8 A) experiments clearly show that overexpression of hGSTA2-2 protects K562 cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis. These results also show that caspase 3-mediated PARP cleavage is also compromised in hGSTA2-2-overexpressing cells that are resistant to H2O2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 9). The observed attenuation of apoptosis in hGSTA2-2-overexpressing cells may be attributed to their ability to accelerate the reduction of PL-OOH. hGSTA2-2 cannot directly detoxify H2O2 because it has no activity toward this substrate. The overexpression of hGSTA2-2 also does not affect the enzyme activities involved in antioxidant functions and regulation of GSH homeostasis which may otherwise lead to the detoxification of H2O2 or other ROS generated during H2O2 exposure. Taken together, our results suggest that PL-OOH or the LPO products downstream of PL-OOH in the LPO cascade of reactions may be involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. This contention finds support in the results of experiments showing that although the treatment of the control K562 cells with PC-OOH causes apoptosis, the cells overexpressing hGSTA2-2 are resistant to the apoptotic effect of PC-OOH under these conditions (Fig.8 B).Another physiological hydroperoxide, 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), has also been implicated in the mechanisms of H2O2-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. Treatment of K562 cells with H2O2 causes activation of 5-lipoxygenase activity leading to the generation of 5-HPETE which is suggested to be involved in the mechanisms of apoptosis (70MacCarrone M. Lorenzon T. Guerrieri P. Agro A.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that hGSTA2-2 can effectively catalyze the reduction of 5-HPETE through its GPx activity (35Zhao T.J. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J.Z. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be speculated that the observed inhibition of H2O2-induced apoptosis in hGSTA2-2-overexpressing cells may be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced GSH-dependent reduction of 5-HPETE by hGSTA2-2. Further studies are needed to explore this possibility.4-HNE, a stable end product of LPO, has been shown to cause apoptosis in a variety of cell lines (11Soh Y. Jeong K.S. Lee I.J. Bae M.A. Kim Y.C.

Overexpression of hGSTA2-2 failed to protect K562 cells from apoptosis caused by 4-HNE which is generated later than PL-OOH in the cascade of LPO chain reactions. This may be expected because hGSTA2-2 does not show high activity for catalyzing the conjugation of 4-HNE to GSH (50Singhal S.S. Zimniak P. Awasthi S. Piper J.T. He N. Teng J.I. Petersen D.R.

https://openalex.org/W1980508602,"The differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes is regulated in part by a cascade of transcriptional events involving activation of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) by dexamethasone (DEX), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (MIX), and insulin. In this study, we demonstrate that exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to DEX and insulin fails to induce adipogenesis as indicated by a lack of C/EBPα, PPARγ2, and adipose protein 2/fatty acid-binding protein expression; however, PPARγ1 is expressed. Treatment of these MIX-deficient cells with a PPARγ ligand, troglitazone, induces C/EBPα expression and rescues the block in adipogenesis. In this regard, we also show that induction of C/EBPα gene expression by troglitazone in C3H10T1/2 cells ectopically expressing PPARγ occurs in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis, suggesting a direct transactivation of the C/EBPα gene by PPARγ. Furthermore, ectopic expression of a dominant negative isoform of C/EBPβ (liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein (LIP)) inhibits the induction of C/EBPα, PPARγ2, and adipose protein 2/fatty acid-binding protein by DEX, MIX, and insulin in 3T3-L1 cells without affecting the induction of PPARγ1 by DEX. Exposure of LIP-expressing preadipocytes to troglitazone along with DEX, MIX, and insulin induces differentiation into adipocytes. Additionally, we show that sustained expression of C/EBPα in these LIP-expressing adipocytes requires constant exposure to troglitazone. Taken together, these observations suggest that inhibition of C/EBPβ activity not only blocks C/EBPα and PPARγ2 expression, but it also renders the preadipocytes dependent on an exogenous PPARγ ligand for their differentiation into adipocytes. We propose, therefore, an additional role for C/EBPβ in regulating PPARγ activity during adipogenesis, and we suggest an alternative means of inducing preadipocyte differentiation that relies on the dexamethasone-associated induction of PPARγ1 expression.

Farmer S.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75 Suppl. 32: 59-67Crossref Google Scholar, 2Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). Many different nuclear factors have been shown to influence the adipogenic process, but two families of factors in particular have received the most attention as follows: the CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs)1 and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) family of nuclear hormone receptors. Three members of the C/EBP family, α, β, and δ, have been shown to play important roles in regulating adipose tissue development in mice and preadipocyte differentiation in vitro (3Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In contrast, only the γ form of the PPAR family is considered to regulate adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo (4Wu Z. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The temporal pattern of expression of these important adipogenic factors, and control of their activity during adipogenesis, is dependent on a variety of biological effectors and other transcription factors (5Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 6Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 7Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C/EBPs belong to a larger family of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, which have a C-terminal leucine zipper domain for dimerization and a basic domain for binding to DNA. There are at least six members of this family, α, β, δ, γ, ε, and ζ, that can both homodimerize and heterodimerize with each other and bind to the same C/EBP regulatory element in the promoters/enhancers of many different genes. In addition, each family member can give rise to several isoforms by a process of selective use of translational start sites within each mRNA or by proteolysis of a larger precursor protein (8Welm A.L. Timchenko N.A. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C/EBPβ mRNA, for instance, gives rise to at least four isoforms corresponding to the following peptides, 38, 34, 30, and 20 kDa. The 34-kDa protein is often referred to as LAP (liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein) since it has been shown to be a potent transactivator of liver gene expression (9Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The 20-kDa polypeptide, however, can inhibit hepatic gene expression and is, therefore, referred to as LIP (liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein) (9Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). This LIP isoform of C/EBPβ corresponds to the C-terminal portion of the LAP protein that lacks the transactivation domain but contains the basic leucine zipper region. Consequently, LIP can act as a potent dominant negative repressor of C/EBPβ activity. In fact, ectopic expression of LIP, resulting in a LAP/LIP ratio of ∼1, blocks adipogenesis in preadipocytes in culture (10Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). PPARγ exists as two protein isoforms, γ1 and γ2, that are generated by alternative splicing of at least three different mRNAs, which are transcribed from the same gene (11Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.-N. Noya D. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 12Fajas L. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). PPARγ1 and γ2 share almost all the same exon sequences, except γ2 contains an additional 30 amino acids at the N terminus. Both isoforms of PPARγ form an obligate heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor to bind to regulatory elements within the promoters/enhancers of many genes associated with lipid metabolism. Activation of PPARγ·RXR complexes requires association with a series of ligands that include RXR ligands such as 9-cis-retinoic acid as well as ligands for PPARγ (13Kliewer S. Sundseth S. Jones S. Brown P. Wisely G. Koble C. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T. Lenhard J. Lehmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). The latter includes polyunsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives as well as the thiazolidinedione family of insulin sensitizers such as troglitazone (14Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar, 15Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Wilson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M.

A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Transcription from the PPARγ gene has been detected in many tissues in which the γ1 isoform is the predominant transcript (17Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). In contrast, transcription from the PPARγ2 promoter is highly adipose tissue-selective giving rise to abundant production of the PPARγ2 polypeptide in addition to the more ubiquitous PPARγ1 isoform (18Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of PPARγ2 or -γ1 in non-adipogenic fibroblasts under appropriate hormonal conditions results in potent induction of adipocyte differentiation (19Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). Various mouse cell lines have been used to delineate the many different processes involved in regulating adipogenesis. Most notable are 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which can be induced to differentiate into mature fat cells following exposure to a mixture of hormonal inducers including dexamethasone (DEX), isobutylmethylxanthine (MIX), insulin, and FBS. MIX and DEX induce expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, respectively, which in turn activate C/EBPα and PPARγ expression (10Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 20Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 21Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). PPARγ and C/EBPα are then capable of cross-activating each other as well as governing expression of the mature adipocytic phenotype (22Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmont G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar,23El-Jack A.K. Hamm J.K. Pilch P.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The normal differentiation of preadipocytes in culture does not require addition of an exogenous PPARγ ligand. In contrast, non-adipogenic fibroblasts that ectopically express a C/EBP or PPARγ require exposure to a potent PPARγ ligand to undergo conversion into adipocytes (24Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 25Wu Z. Xie Y. Morrison R.F. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Preadipocytes have likely acquired the ability to produce an appropriate ligand of PPARγ. The molecular mechanisms that regulate production of such molecules are not known. Earlier studies by others (26Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) have suggested a role for the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). We demonstrate that attenuation of C/EBPβ activity by omitting MIX from the culture medium or ectopically expressing a dominant negative form of C/EBPβ (LIP) renders 3T3-L1 preadipocytes dependent on an exogenous PPARγ ligand for their differentiation into adipocytes. These studies have also uncovered an alternative pathway of adipogenesis, which involves a glucocorticoid-associated induction of PPARγ1 in the absence of C/EBPβ activity. Furthermore, activation of PPARγ1 in the LIP-expressing cells with troglitazone directly activates C/EBPα gene expression. Dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, insulin, puromycin, aprotinin, leupeptin, and digitonin were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum were supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. [α−32P]dCTP and [γ-32P[ATP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Troglitazone was from Parke-Davis/Warner Lambert. We used a monoclonal anti-PPARγ antibody and polyclonal antibodies against the C/EBPs, α, β, and δ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and polyclonal anti-aP2 serum (kindly provided by Dr. David Bernlohr, University of Minnesota, MN). The BOSC 23 packaging cells (27Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar), pBabe-Puro and pBabe-PPARγ-Puro retroviral expression vectors (19Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), were kind gifts of Dr. Bruce Spiegelman (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School). The pBabe vector expressing either the LAP or LIP isoforms of C/EBPβ were constructed by subcloning corresponding PCR products of the C/EBPβ cDNA (20Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of the pBabe-puro vector. The LAP PCR fragments were generated using the following primers: cβ−1 (5′-CGCGGATCCCCACCATGGAAGTGGCCAACTT) and cβ-3 (5′-CCGGAATTCGCATCAAGTCCCGAAACCCGGT), and the LIP PCR fragments were generated using cβ-2 (5′-CGCGGATCCCCACCATGGCGGCCGGCTT) and cβ-3 primers. Transfection of BOSC 23 packaging cells and subsequent infection of target cells were performed as described by others (19Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar,27Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Infected target cells were selected for 6–10 days in medium containing 2.0 μg/ml puromycin. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured, maintained, and differentiated as described previously (28Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated and grown for 2 days post-confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Differentiation was then induced (Day 0) by changing the medium to DMEM containing 10% FBS, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μmdexamethasone, and 1.67 μm insulin. After 48 h, cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS. 3T3-L1 cells expressing either C/EBPβ LIP or control vector and 10T1/2 cells expressing PPARγ were differentiated by the same protocol for 3T3-L1 cells, except growth medium was DMEM containing 10% FBS and 2.0 μg of puromycin, and the cells were differentiated and maintained in the presence or absence of 10 μm troglitazone, except as noted. Oil Red O staining was performed following the procedure described previously (29Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then photographed using phase contrast microscopy. At the indicated times, cultured cells grown in 10-cm dishes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and then harvested in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% SDS, 5 μm aprotinin, and 50 μmleupeptin. Lysates were vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged for 15 min at full speed (13,000 rpm) in a microcentrifuge. Pellets were discarded and supernatants stored at −80 °C. Protein content of supernatants was determined using the BCA kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide (acrylamide from American BioAnalytical) gels as described previously (23El-Jack A.K. Hamm J.K. Pilch P.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. After transfer, the membrane was blocked with 4% nonfat dry milk in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with the primary antibodies specified above, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and an enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used for detection. Total RNA was harvested according to the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in buffer containing 4 m guanidinium isothiocyanate. Lysates were extracted with acid phenol/chloroform, and RNA was precipitated in 50% isopropyl alcohol overnight at −20 °C. Northern blot analysis was performed on 20 μg of each sample RNA as described. cDNA probes for C/EBPα and PPARγ were labeled using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P[dCTP by random priming. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared essentially as described. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Samples were spun at low speed in a clinical centrifuge. Supernatants were discarded, and nuclei were lysed in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 350 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 25% glycerol). Nuclear extracts were incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at full speed (13,000 rpm) at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA binding assays were performed as described previously (31Rana B. Xie Y. Mischoulon D. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18123-18132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of nuclear extract was incubated with 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2 μl of carrier mix (50 mm MgCl2, 340 mm KCl), and delta buffer (0.1 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 8% Ficoll, 1 mmdithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 15 min. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to a C/EBP-binding site (5′-gatccGCGTTGCGCCACGATG-3′ and 5′-CATCGTGGCGCAACGCggatc-3′) were end-labeled with [γ-32P[ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). For supershift experiments, antibody was added, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h. Reactions were mixed with labeled probes on ice for 30 min and resolved on nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide (39.5:0.5 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gels at 200 V for 2–2.5 h at 4 °C in TBE buffer (80 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). Gels were vacuum-dried for 1 h before exposure to Biomax MR-1 autoradiography film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Antibodies used for C/EBP supershifts were the same as described above. Goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Sigma) were used in negative control experiments. To understand the roles of various inducers and the C/EBPs in regulating adipogenesis, we generated 3T3-L1 cell lines expressing vector DNA alone (designated L1-V cells) or the dominant negative C/EBPβ, LIP (designated L1-LIP cells). To determine the effect of the different inducers on expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, we stimulated L1-V cells to differentiate by exposure to different combinations of insulin, dexamethasone (DEX), and isobutylmethylxanthine (MIX) in the presence or absence of 10 μm troglitazone. Cells were maintained according to the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” and total protein was harvested 4 days after induction. Fig. 1, lane 7, shows the abundant expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα by 4 days of differentiation following exposure to DEX, MIX, insulin, and FBS. The presence of troglitazone appears to attenuate expression of these transcription factors (lane 8). Omission of DEX and/or MIX from the culture medium significantly attenuates differentiation of these preadipocytes into mature fat cells as indicated by the barely detectable expression of C/EBPα and aP2 in each case (lanes 1, 3, and 5). Interestingly, PPARγ1 is abundantly expressed in cells exposed to either DEX or MIX alone but not to the same extent as that when the two inducers are used together (comparelane 7 with lanes 3 and 5). PPARγ2, however, appears to be more highly expressed in cells exposed to DEX compared with those exposed to MIX (compare lane 5 withlane 3). Activation of PPARγ1 in these differentiation-compromised cells (cells deprived of DEX or MIX) by exposure to troglitazone resulted in an extensive induction of C/EBPα and aP2 (lanes 4 and 6) and a corresponding conversion of the preadipocytes into morphologically distinct adipocytes (data not shown). Earlier studies by us and others (10Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 21Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 29Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that one of the mechanisms by which DEX and MIX induce adipogenesis is to enhance expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ during the initial few hours of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells, which in turn activate expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. Fig. 1 suggests that these effectors may in fact be regulating two separate pathways in which DEX alone can induce PPARγ1 expression, but MIX is required along with DEX for C/EBPα expression. Consequently, since MIX has been shown to regulate C/EBPβ (20Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar), we questioned whether the induction of C/EBPα by troglitazone in cells deprived of MIX was due to a corresponding troglitazone-associated induction of C/EBPβ. In the experiment presented in Fig. 2, 3T3-L1 cells were exposed to insulin and DEX in the presence or absence of MIX or troglitazone, and total protein extracts harvested at the indicated times were subjected to Western blot analysis. At 4 h post-induction, C/EBPβ is expressed in cells treated with the complete set of inducers (lanes 3 and 4), whereas very little C/EBPβ is produced in the absence of MIX (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 2). Addition of troglitazone has no significant effect on C/EBPβ expression in the presence or absence of MIX (compare lane 1 with lane 2, and lane 3 with lane 4). This figure also shows that expression of PPARγ1 occurs much earlier (at 24 h) in cells exposed to mixture lacking MIX than cells cultured in the complete mixture (Fig.1, compare lanes 5 and 7). By 72 h after treatment, PPARγ1 is abundantly expressed in both populations of cells (minus or plus MIX); however, PPARγ2 and C/EBPα are expressed to any significant extent only in cells exposed to DEX and MIX (comparelanes 9 and 11). The presence of troglitazone resulted in an extensive induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ2 in MIX-deprived cells but also enhanced expression of C/EBPα in cells exposed to MIX. The induction of C/EBPα by troglitazone suggests that PPARγ may be capable of directly transactivating the C/EBPα gene. To test this idea, we ectopically expressed PPARγ2 in C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells to create a cell line (10T-Pγ) whose differentiation into adipocytes was dependent on an exogenous PPARγ ligand. The Northern blot in Fig. 3 shows that exposure of these cells to 10 μm troglitazone results in the induction of C/EBPα mRNA expression that also occurs in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis (+ cycloheximide). These data are consistent with the notion that PPARγ is interacting directly with the C/EBPα gene to enhance C/EBPα mRNA production. To determine if the selective effect of omitting MIX on C/EBPα compared with PPARγ1 expression was primarily due to its role in regulating C/EBPβ, we generated a 3T3-L1 cell line ectopically expressing a dominant negative isoform of C/EBPβ (designated L1-LIP cells). Fig. 4 A shows abundant expression of LIP (3rd lane) in proliferating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes compared with undetectable levels of this polypeptide in the vector cells (1st lane). Also shown is the ectopic expression of the LAP (34 kDa) isoform of C/EBPβ in a corresponding L1-LAP cell line (2nd lane). As observed previously by McKnight and co-workers (10Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), ectopic expression of LIP completely blocks the ability of DEX, MIX, insulin, and FBS to induce the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to differentiate into fat cells. The data shown in Fig. 4 Bconfirm this result, but they also show that troglitazone can reverse this inhibitory action of LIP as judged by the accumulation of Oil Red O-positive lipid droplets following exposure of the L1-LIP cells to troglitazone. To gain insight into the effect of LIP and troglitazone on the differentiation of preadipocytes, L1-LIP cells were induced to differentiate as in Fig. 1, where MIX and/or DEX were omitted from the culture medium. Extracts of total protein were then harvested at day 4 and subjected to Western blot analysis. Fig.5 shows that expression of LIP greatly attenuates adipogenesis under all hormonal conditions as indicated by a lack of C/EBPα and aP2 expression (lanes 1, 3, 5, and7). DEX is capable of enhancing PPARγ1 expression above the low basal levels produced in the presence of insulin and FBS, but it has no positive effect on PPARγ2 expression (compare lane 1 and 3). Addition of troglitazone along with DEX induces adipogenesis as indicated by the expression of C/EBPα, PPARγ2, and aP2. It is worth noting that DEX has a similar effect on gene expression in the presence or absence of LIP (compare Fig. 5,lanes 3 and 4 with Fig. 1, lanes 3 and4). In contrast, exposure of LIP cells to MIX and insulin only slightly enhances PPARγ1 with no PPARγ2 expression, and when troglitazone is added under these conditions it does not induce adipogenesis (i.e. minimal aP2 and C/EBPα expression). This pattern of gene expression differs significantly from that observed in the absence of LIP. Specifically, MIX induces both PPARγ1 and -2 in the L1-vector cells, and consequently, exposure of these cells to troglitazone promotes adipogenesis (compare Fig. 1,lanes 5 and 6, with Fig. 4, lanes 5and 6). Taken together, these data are consistent with a model in which DEX is capable of priming the preadipocytes to be responsive to troglitazone even in the absence of C/EBPβ; this likely involves induction of PPARγ1 expression. MIX, however, is only capable of a similar priming process if C/EBPβ is actively expressed in the absence of LIP. These data also strongly suggest that inhibiting C/EBPβ activity blocks production of an endogenous activator of PPARγ, which renders the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes dependent on an exogenous PPARγ ligand for their differentiation into adipocytes. To gain more insight into the ligand dependence of these LIP-expressing preadipocytes, we analyzed the temporal pattern of gene expression following exposure to troglitazone as well as determining the optimum dose of troglitazone required to induce adipogenesis. In the experiment shown in Fig. 6, confluent L1-LIP cells were exposed to DEX, MIX, and insulin in the presence or absence of troglitazone, and total cellular proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis. The combination of DEX, MIX, and insulin is capable of initiating the early phase of adipogenesis in these LIP-expressing cells as indicated by induction of C/EBPβ as well as PPARγ1 (compare lane 2 and 4 with lane 1). Exposure of these cells to troglitazone appears to have no significant effect on this pattern of gene expression during the first 2 days. After this time, however, troglitazone is essential for the induction of C/EBPα and aP2 expression. Taken together, the studies shown above demonstrate that culturing LIP cells in troglitazone for 6 days, along with an initial priming with DEX,"

Furthermore, whereas the levels of uterine anandamide (endocannabinoid) and blastocyst CB1 are coordinately down-regulated with the onset of uterine receptivity and blastocyst activation prior to implantation, these levels remained high in the nonreceptive uterus and in dormant blastocysts during delayed implantation and in pregnant, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-deficient mice with implantation failure. These results suggest that a tight regulation of endocannabinoid signaling is important for synchronizing embryo development with uterine receptivity for implantation.

However, anandamide levels are significantly lower at implantation sites than at interimplantation sites, suggesting endocannabinoid ligand-receptor signaling during implantation (3Schmid P.C.

Interestingly, 2-arachidonoylglycerol is present in the mouse uterus at amounts similar to or lower than the lowest anandamide levels (1–5 nmol/g of tissue), and its level does not vary significantly between implantation and interimplantation sites. 1B.

Using cannabinoid receptor mutant mice (19Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Hohmann A.G. Herkenham M. Bonner T.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5780-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) and physiological approaches, we further defined the role of ligand-receptor signaling with cannabinoids in preimplantation embryo development and in implantation.DISCUSSIONThe mechanism(s) by which the development of preimplantation embryos into active blastocysts is synchronized with uterine receptivity for implantation is not clearly understood. Our present observations of the asynchronous development of embryos deficient in cannabinoid receptors during the preimplantation period and of the coordinated down-regulation of both uterine anandamide levels and blastocyst cannabinoid receptors prior to implantation in wild-type mice suggest that ligand-receptor signaling with endocannabinoids locally helps in regulating the “window” of implantation. Although the Mendelian frequency of offspring resulting from heterozygous crossings of CB1-null mice is skewed resulting in a somewhat reduced number of homozygous offspring (19Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Hohmann A.G. Herkenham M. Bonner T.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5780-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), and although the pregnancy rate in mutant mice resulting from homozygous mating is somewhat lower, the birth of viable CB1 −/−,CB2 −/−, orCB1 −/− /CB2 −/− double mutant offspring suggests that the absence of embryonic and/or uterine cannabinoid receptors is not indispensable for embryonic development or implantation. However, the observed increased mortality ofCB1 −/− offspring perhaps could be due to inferior fetal development resulting from the implantation of slowly developing embryos (19Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Hohmann A.G. Herkenham M. Bonner T.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5780-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The major phenotypes ofCB1 −/− orCB1 −/− /CB2 −/− double mutant mice are their resistance to exogenous cannabinoid exposure with respect to embryo development and implantation in vitro andin vivo. This suggests that embryonic development and implantation are likely to be affected by aberrant levels of exogenous or endogenous cannabinoids in the uterus and/or aberrant embryonic expression of cannabinoid receptors during early pregnancy.On day 5 of pseudopregnancy when the uterus is still receptive,LIF expression persists in uterine glands. In contrast,LIF expression is undetectable or extremely low in the nonreceptive day 6-uterus.3 Moreover, estrogen is essential for the induction of uterine LIF in mice (20Song H. Lim H. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Bhatt H. Brunet L.J. Stewart C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11408-11412Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the absence of LIF expression in the P4-primed delayed implant mouse uterus and its rapid induction after an estrogen injection (20Song H. Lim H. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, the virtual absence of uterine LIF on day 6 and during delayed implantation correlates with higher uterine anandamide levels and implantation failure. However, we do not know whether the absence of LIF is the cause of higher uterine anandamide levels or whether the higher levels are the consequence of implantation failure in the absence of LIF.The physiological significance of anandamide in the uterus and cannabinoid receptors in the blastocyst is still not fully understood. Although it is clear that higher uterine anandamide and blastocyst cannabinoid receptor levels are detrimental to the implantation process, uterine anandamide and blastocyst cannabinoid receptors still persist, albeit at lower levels, at the time of implantation. This suggests that lower levels of anandamide and cannabinoid receptors are beneficial to implantation. This suggestion is consistent with our recent observation that whereas higher anandamide levels are detrimental to blastocyst outgrowth in culture, lower levels stimulate this event (5Wang J. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Armant D.R. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar biphasic (inhibitory and stimulatory) effects of anandamide at high and low concentrations are evident for other neural and behavioral functions (29Sulcova E. Mechoulam R. Fride E. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1998; 59: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), although the definitive cause of these biphasic effects of anandamide is not yet clearly understood (29Sulcova E. Mechoulam R. Fride E. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1998; 59: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). More recently, a bidirectional regulation of airway responsiveness by endogenous cannabinoids has been documented (30Calignano A. Katona I. Desarnaud F. Giuffrida A. La Rana G. Mackie K. Freund T.F. Piomelli D. Nature. 2000; 408: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is envisioned that a biphasic paracrine signaling via anandamide and cannabinoid receptors influences the fate of the embryo-uterine interactions during implantation and that aberrant levels of uterine anandamide and/or embryonic cannabinoid receptors are likely to adversely affect embryonic development and implantation. This could be a mechanism to prevent implantation of abnormal embryos resulting from exposure to aberrant levels of cannabinoids. In conclusion, the present study highlights the importance of the ligand-receptor signaling with cannabinoids in female fertility and places the embryo and/or the uterus as targets for this signaling. Previous investigation suggested that cannabinoid exposure has adverse effects on pregnancy outcome (reviewed in Refs. 1Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, 2-arachidonoylglycerol is present in the mouse uterus at amounts similar to or lower than the lowest anandamide levels (1–5 nmol/g of tissue), and its level does not vary significantly between implantation and interimplantation sites. 1B.

Using cannabinoid receptor mutant mice (19Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Hohmann A.G. Herkenham M. Bonner T.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5780-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) and physiological approaches, we further defined the role of ligand-receptor signaling with cannabinoids in preimplantation embryo development and in implantation. DISCUSSIONThe mechanism(s) by which the development of preimplantation embryos into active blastocysts is synchronized with uterine receptivity for implantation is not clearly understood. Our present observations of the asynchronous development of embryos deficient in cannabinoid receptors during the preimplantation period and of the coordinated down-regulation of both uterine anandamide levels and blastocyst cannabinoid receptors prior to implantation in wild-type mice suggest that ligand-receptor signaling with endocannabinoids locally helps in regulating the “window” of implantation. Although the Mendelian frequency of offspring resulting from heterozygous crossings of CB1-null mice is skewed resulting in a somewhat reduced number of homozygous offspring (19Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Hohmann A.G. Herkenham M. Bonner T.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5780-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), and although the pregnancy rate in mutant mice resulting from homozygous mating is somewhat lower, the birth of viable CB1 −/−,CB2 −/−, orCB1 −/− /CB2 −/− double mutant offspring suggests that the absence of embryonic and/or uterine cannabinoid receptors is not indispensable for embryonic development or implantation. However, the observed increased mortality ofCB1 −/− offspring perhaps could be due to inferior fetal development resulting from the implantation of slowly developing embryos (19Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Hohmann A.G. Herkenham M. Bonner T.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5780-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The major phenotypes ofCB1 −/− orCB1 −/− /CB2 −/− double mutant mice are their resistance to exogenous cannabinoid exposure with respect to embryo development and implantation in vitro andin vivo. This suggests that embryonic development and implantation are likely to be affected by aberrant levels of exogenous or endogenous cannabinoids in the uterus and/or aberrant embryonic expression of cannabinoid receptors during early pregnancy.On day 5 of pseudopregnancy when the uterus is still receptive,LIF expression persists in uterine glands. In contrast,LIF expression is undetectable or extremely low in the nonreceptive day 6-uterus.3 Moreover, estrogen is essential for the induction of uterine LIF in mice (20Song H. Lim H. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Bhatt H. Brunet L.J. Stewart C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11408-11412Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the absence of LIF expression in the P4-primed delayed implant mouse uterus and its rapid induction after an estrogen injection (20Song H. Lim H. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, the virtual absence of uterine LIF on day 6 and during delayed implantation correlates with higher uterine anandamide levels and implantation failure. However, we do not know whether the absence of LIF is the cause of higher uterine anandamide levels or whether the higher levels are the consequence of implantation failure in the absence of LIF.The physiological significance of anandamide in the uterus and cannabinoid receptors in the blastocyst is still not fully understood. Although it is clear that higher uterine anandamide and blastocyst cannabinoid receptor levels are detrimental to the implantation process, uterine anandamide and blastocyst cannabinoid receptors still persist, albeit at lower levels, at the time of implantation. This suggests that lower levels of anandamide and cannabinoid receptors are beneficial to implantation. This suggestion is consistent with our recent observation that whereas higher anandamide levels are detrimental to blastocyst outgrowth in culture, lower levels stimulate this event (5Wang J. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Armant D.R. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar biphasic (inhibitory and stimulatory) effects of anandamide at high and low concentrations are evident for other neural and behavioral functions (29Sulcova E. Mechoulam R. Fride E. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1998; 59: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), although the definitive cause of these biphasic effects of anandamide is not yet clearly understood (29Sulcova E. Mechoulam R. Fride E. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1998; 59: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). More recently, a bidirectional regulation of airway responsiveness by endogenous cannabinoids has been documented (30Calignano A. Katona I. Desarnaud F. Giuffrida A. La Rana G. Mackie K. Freund T.F. Piomelli D. Nature. 2000; 408: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is envisioned that a biphasic paracrine signaling via anandamide and cannabinoid receptors influences the fate of the embryo-uterine interactions during implantation and that aberrant levels of uterine anandamide and/or embryonic cannabinoid receptors are likely to adversely affect embryonic development and implantation. This could be a mechanism to prevent implantation of abnormal embryos resulting from exposure to aberrant levels of cannabinoids. In conclusion, the present study highlights the importance of the ligand-receptor signaling with cannabinoids in female fertility and places the embryo and/or the uterus as targets for this signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2060198143,"To gain fundamental information regarding the molecular basis of endothelial cell adhesive interactions during vascular formation, we have cloned and characterized a unique cell adhesion molecule. This molecule, named endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM), is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The conceptual protein encoded by cDNA clones consists of V-type and C2-type immunoglobulin domains as well as a hydrophobic signal sequence, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. Northern blot analysis showed ESAM to be selectively expressed in cultured human and murine vascular endothelial cells and revealed high level expression in lung and heart and low level expression in kidney and skin. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that ESAM is primarily expressed in the developing vasculature of the embryo in an endothelial cell-restricted pattern. Epitope-tagged ESAM was shown to co-localize with cadherins and catenins in cell-cell junctions. In aggregation assays employing ESAM-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, this novel molecule was shown to mediate cell-cell adhesion through homophilic interactions. The endothelial cell-selective expression of this immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecule coupled with its in vitro functional profile strongly suggests a role in cell-cell interactions that is critical for vascular development or function."

The ribosomes present in mammalian mitochondria are 55–60 S particles and are composed of small (28 S) and large (39 S) subunits (1Pel H. Grivell L. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). They are characterized by a low percentage of rRNA and a compensating increase in the number of ribosomal proteins (2De Vries H. van der Koogh-Schuuring R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Genetics and Biogenesis of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria. Elsevier, Amsterdam1976: 741-748Google Scholar). The small subunit of the ribosome contains a 12 S rRNA and about 30 proteins while the large subunit consists of a 16 S rRNA and about 50 proteins (4Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D.

Recently, 18 proteins from the large subunit and 17 proteins from the small subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome have been characterized. The analysis of these proteins was carried out primarily following separation of the proteins on two-dimensional gels. Sequence information on the separated proteins was obtained by Edman degradation or by sequencing proteolytic products using Edman chemistry or mass spectrometry. The data obtained was used extensively to probe the EST data bases and the full-length cDNAs and the corresponding amino acid sequences were then assembled (6Goldschmidt-Reisin S. Kitakawa M.

The remainder fall into new classes of ribosomal proteins. The identification of proteins in mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes has been challenging due to their low abundance. The traditional approach to sequence the proteins present has been to separate them using two-dimensional gels or high performance liquid chromatography. Individual proteins are then digested and sequence obtained on the peptides generated. In the present study, we have combined this approach with a streamlined analysis involving proteolytic digestions of whole 28 S subunits. Sequence information on peptides present in this complex mixture was obtained by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The sequence information obtained was used in data base searches to allow the deduction of the complete amino acid sequences of these proteins. A related approach has recently been reported for the analysis of the protein composition of yeast cytoplasmic ribosomes (14Tong W. Link A. Eng J.K. Yates J.R. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2270-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The approach used here allowed us to identify 14 new mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. Of these, 10 have homologs in prokaryotic ribosomes (including three variants of ribosomal protein S18) while 4 are members of new classes of small subunit ribosomal proteins. This work and previous efforts have lead to what we believe is the complete identification of all the proteins in the small subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome. Bovine mitochondria and 28 S subunits were prepared as described previously by Matthews et al. (4Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the 28 S subunits were collected by centrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 6 h in a Beckman Type-50 rotor. For analysis of individual proteins separated on two-dimensional gels, samples were prepared as described previously prior to loading on nonequilibrium pH gradient tube gels (5Cahill A. Baio D. Cunningham C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Koc E.C. Blackburn K. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For analysis of proteins in whole 28 S subunit preparations, 55 S mitochondrial ribosomes were isolated on sucrose gradients (4Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These ribosomes were diluted in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, and 2 mmdithiothreitol to dissociate the 55 S ribosomes into 28 S and 39 S subunits. Two-ml samples were then applied to 36-ml linear gradients (10 to 30% sucrose in the above buffer). Samples were subjected to centrifugation for 16 h at 24,000 rpm in a SW27 rotor. The gradients were fractionated and 28 S subunits were collected by centrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 6 h. The 28 S subunit pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and stored at −70 °C. Randomly picked spots from the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the mitochondrial ribosomal small (28 S) subunit were excised and digested in-gel with trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland) as described previously (9Koc E.C.

Nanoscale capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS)1 analyses of in-gel digests were done using an Ultimate capillary LC system (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) fitted with a Z-spray ion source as described previously (8Koc E.C. Blackburn K. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For analysis of proteins in whole small subunits, 3 pmol of 28 S subunits (isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation following the dissociation of 55 S particles) were subjected to endoprotease Lys-C (Wako BioProducts, Richmond VA) digestion (16Burkhart W. Angeletti R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press, New York1992: 399-406Google Scholar). The peptides that were obtained from the whole 28 S subunit digests were analyzed by nanoscale capillary LC/MS/MS with and without a variable-flow LC/MS interface. 2J. P. C. Vissers, M. A. Moseley, and R. K. Blackburn, manuscript in preparation. Uninterpreted peptide product ion spectra generated by LC/MS/MS were searched against the nonredundant protein data base and EST data bases for exact matches using the Mascot search program (17Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cotrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar). High quality spectra which had no exact matches in either the protein or EST data bases were sequencedde novo either manually or with the aid of the PepSeq program (Micromass). In manual sequencing, ions originating from the C terminus (y“ ion series) or from the N terminus (b ion series) formed by cleavage of the amide bonds along the peptide backbone were identified. Adjacent y” or b ions differ by the corresponding amino acid residue mass, enabling assignment of peptide amino acid sequence. Peptide sequences obtained from Mascot searches of the protein and EST data bases and those obtained byde novo sequencing were searched against the nonredundant protein data base using the FASTA algorithm (18Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9378) Google Scholar). For peptides with no exact matches in the data bases, sequences obtained by de novo sequencing were used for FASTA searches. Because mass spectrometry cannot distinguish between amino acids Leu and Ile which have the same residue masses, initial data base searches were carried out using Leu in the peptide sequences. Hits with an Ile at these positions were considered exact matches. If no hits were obtained with Leu in the query sequence, the search was redone with Ile. The isobaric (same nominal molecular weight) amino acids Phe and oxidized Met (a common artifact of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were distinguished by diagnostic loss of methanesulfonic acid (64 Da) from oxidized Met (19Jiang X. Smith J.B. Abraham E.C. J. Mass Spec. 1996; 31: 1309-1310Crossref Google Scholar). Because the protease endoprotease Lys-C which cleaves on the C-terminal side of Lys residues was used for in-gel andin situ digestions, Lys residues could be distinguished with a fairly high certainty from isobaric Gln residues. EST data base and genomic DNA searches of the peptide sequences were performed using the BLAST search program (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis and homology comparisons were done using the GCG DNA analysis software package (44Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package version 10. Genetics Computer Group, Madison WI1999Google Scholar), Vector NTI (Informax Inc.), and Biology WorkBench 3.2. The results were displayed using BOXSHADE (version 3.21, written by K. Hofmann and M. Baron). Prediction of the cleavage sites for the mitochondrial signal sequence was carried out using PSort and MitoProt II (21Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 22Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 770-786Crossref Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel analysis of the proteins present in bovine liver mitochondrial 28 S subunits suggested the presence of as many as 33 ribosomal proteins. These proteins were designated S1 to S33 in order of decreasing molecular weight (4Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, as protein sequence information became available, it became clear that designating mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins in this way does not provide a consistent nomenclature for these proteins from different mammals. For example, bovine MRP-S18 is the same protein as rat MRP-S13 (11O'Brien T.W. Liu J. Sylvester J. Mourgey E.B. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Thiede B. Wittmann-Liebold B. Graack H.-R. J. Biol.

To simplify the literature and to facilitate the comparisons of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins to those from other translational systems, we are using a system of nomenclature similar to that recently adopted for chloroplast ribosomal proteins (23Yamaguchi K. von Knoblauch K. Subramanian A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28455-28465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 24Yamaguchi K. Subramanian A.R. J. Biol.

In this system, proteins with prokaryotic homologs are given the same number as the corresponding ribosomal protein in E. coli. For example, MRP-S7 is the mammalian mitochondrial homolog of bacterial S7. Proteins without bacterial homologs are given the next available number. Since there are 21 proteins in the bacterial ribosome, we began designating the new mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins beginning at MRP-S22 (9Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Moseley A.

In previous work, we identified 9 bovine mitochondrial small subunit mitochondrial ribosomal proteins that do not have prokaryotic homologs and used the designations MRP-S22 through MRP-S30. The current manuscript describes 10 homologs of bacterial ribosomal proteins and four new class small subunit ribosomal proteins, MRP-S31, MRP-S32, MRP-S33, and MRP-S36. The strategies used here to identify and characterize bovine mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are summarized in Fig.1. The traditional approach used to identify proteins present in complex mixtures has been to separate them on two-dimensional gels. Individual protein spots are then subjected to proteolytic digestion and peptide sequence information obtained on them. This strategy was used in previous studies to obtain the sequences of 10 small subunit ribosomal proteins (8Koc E.C. Blackburn K. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Moseley A. Koc H. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol.

Sci. 2001; 10: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the current work, an additional ribosomal protein has been identified using this method. To streamline the analysis of additional proteins present in 28 S subunits, whole subunits were subjected to proteolytic digestion. The resulting peptide mixture was analyzed by nanoscale capillary LC/MS/MS using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer with data-dependent MS to MS/MS switching (Fig. 1). With this method, peptides derived from 28 S subunits are eluted from a reversed-phase nanoscale capillary LC column into the source of the mass spectrometer. The MS is used much like a UV monitor to detect material eluting from the column (Fig.2 A) and to determine the location of peptides of potential interest (Fig. 2 B). A representative analysis of one of the peptides obtained is shown in Fig. 2 C. In this example, the MS spectrum of the peak eluting at ∼57 min (labeled in Fig. 2 B) is analyzed. This peak has an abundant ion at m/z 569.8. The sequence of this peptide was obtained from the product ion fragmentation spectrum obtained from MS/MS analysis (Fig.2 D). The spectrum illustrated in Fig. 2 D, and all other product ion spectra, were initially searched against the nonredundant protein and EST data bases using the Mascot search program (17Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cotrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar). This program searches for peptide sequences from entries in the data bases which would generate product ion spectra matching the fragmentation patterns observed in the individual spectrum. For the spectrum in Fig.2 D, for example, the Mascot program returned the sequence RYLLMSIDK from MRP-S15 as an exact match. For those spectra without exact matches from Mascot, the product ion spectra were manually sequenced de novo (see “Materials and Methods”). The approach used here provided a large amount of new peptide sequence information which is summarized in TableI. Peptide sequences obtained from the previously identified mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are not included in this table to simplify the presentation of the data. Sequences of the peptides (Table I) were used to search the human EST data base using the tBLASTN program (National Center for Biotechnology Information). In most cases a number of EST clones gave positive hits for these sequences. Overlapping clones for these hits were obtained using the initial hits as virtual probes to rescreen the human EST data base. Consensus cDNAs were then assembled by repetitive searching and comparison of the EST sequences. Sequencing errors were corrected as much as possible by comparison of overlapping clones. Where possible, EST assemblages from the TIGR data base were examined and used to facilitate the assembly of the full-length sequences and to help evaluate potential sequencing errors in the EST clones. The sequence of the longest possible cDNA was then assembled in silico. Generally, the fully assembled human sequence was used as a query against entries in the mouse ESTs andCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster genomic data bases.Table IAmino acid sequences of mature MRPs of Bos taurus deduced from database searching of peptide product ion spectra from whole 28 S subunitsSequencem/zProtein matchSwiss-Protein numberBovineHumanFMEPYIFGSR1245.69MRP-S2P82923Q9Y399ECEGIVPVPLEEK1545.77MRP-S6P82931P82932AMQRPETAAALK1285.68MRP-S6GTGIAAQTAGIAAAAK1370.86MRP-S11P82911P82912KFEEIPIAHIK1323.60MRP-S11ASCGTEGFR1031.31MRP-S11DYQNVPGIEK1161.42MRP-S15P82913P82914DYQNVPGIEKVDDVVK1816.74MRP-S15RLLSLEMANK1173.76MRP-S15RYLLMSIDK1137.62MRP-S15ALCIRVFQEVQK1537.84MRP-S15ELGIEYTFPPPYHRK1845.94MRP-S15EQAAEGLQLIK1198.66MRP-S15TNYPVFEK996.56MRP-S15…LEAQLVAL… 1-aInternal sequences of a peptide fragment.1573.68MRP-S15YLLMSIDQR1137.72MRP-S15…PMPNSHADK… 1-aInternal sequences of a peptide fragment.2822.92MRP-S16P82915Q9Y3D3RAQEVLLAAQK1225.71MRP-S16TYFAHDALEQCTVGDIVLLK2339.20MRP-S17P82916Q9Y2R5HELAEIVFK1084.59MRP-S17HVKHELAEIVFK1448.81MRP-S17VGQVVDPVTGK1097.61MRP-S17RCAGTTYLESPVDLETTPLAK2369.31MRP-S17SITGLCQEEHR1376.41MRP-S18(1)P82917Q9Y3D5HITGLCGK932.40MRP-S18(1)QVTSSESLPIPMENPYK1947.04MRP-S18(1)QVTSSEDLPIPMENPYKEPLK2414.33MRP-S18(1)ARDHGLLSYHIPQVEPR1986.59MRP-S18(2)P82918Q9Y676APPEDDSLPPIPVSPYEDEPWK2477.16MRP-S18(2)MAVGSPLLKDNVSYTGRPLVLYH2528.66MRP-S18(3)P82919Q9NVS2INFLMRK920.49MRP-S21P82920P82921YYEKPCR1062.40MRP-S21NRADPWQGC1150.37MRP-S21QDWLILHIPDAHLWVK1983.07MRP-S29P82922P51398KSPLTPEELLLQ1856.82MRP-S29SPNTPEELALLQ 1-bDe novo sequenced peptide product ion spectra.1856.76MRP-S29PLEAVTWLK1729.86MRP-S29AYLPQELLGK1130.63MRP-S29LQTSLNNDARQH2116.96MRP-S29TVFPHGLPPRFVMQVK1852.02MRP-S29NTNFAHPAVRYVLYGEK1978.01MRP-S29HGEQHVGQHYNISIQELK2116.04MRP-S29AAPVARYPPIVASLTADSK1926.06MRP-S30P82924Q9NP92YPPIVASLTADSK1360.72MRP-S30NICWGTQSMPLYETIEDNDVK2560.16MRP-S30ISFSNIISDMK1253.46MRP-S31P82925Q92665QGPIRHFMELVTCGLSK2019.66MRP-S31VEHIEWFRNYFNEK1910.07MRP-S31LWEFPINNEAGFDDDGSEFHEHIFLDK3219.80MRP-S31YLEGFPK852.52MRP-S31QLAAVTEQPFQNGFEEMIQWTK2594.13MRP-S31SKQLEHGPMIEQLSK1724.67MRP-S32P82927Q9Y6G3LFSEQPLAK1031.46MRP-S33P82926Q9Y291AWGILTFK934.60MRP-S34P82929P82930LVIGRIFHIVENDLYID2416.86MRP-S35P82928Q9Y2Q9ANLNEEIIK914.58MRP-S35SPDWLMHQGPPDTAEMIK2052.02MRP-S36P82908P82909LVSQEEIEFIQRGGPE1830.03MRP-S361-a Internal sequences of a peptide fragment.1-b De novo sequenced peptide product ion spectra. Open table in a new tab The peptide sequence information obtained allowed the identification of 8 new homologs of prokaryotic ribosomal proteins, one of which (S18) is present in three variants bringing the total number of new bacterial homologs identified to 10. In addition, 4 novel small subunit ribosomal proteins were identified belonging to new classes. The new sequence information provided here brings the total number of 28 S subunit ribosomal proteins to 31. In addition, with one exception (MRP-S12), all of the previously identified mammalian mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal proteins were identified. The large number of proteins identified using this approach illustrates the power of this method for the analysis of complex protein mixtures. Since there are three variants of S18, only one of which is presumably present in each small subunit, each subunit would have a complement of 29 ribosomal proteins. Previously 33 potential small subunit ribosomal proteins were reported by Matthews et al. (4Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pietromonaco S. Denslow N. O'Brien T.W. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) based on two-dimensional gel patterns. This value probably represents an overestimation of the number of proteins in the small subunit. This overestimation could be due to contamination of small subunit preparations with large subunit ribosomal proteins. 3E. C. Koc, W. Burkhart, K. Blackburn, A. Moseley, and L. L. Spremulli, manuscript in preparation. Additional putative small subunit proteins appearing as bands on two-dimensional gels could also arise from modified (and/or partially degraded) small subunit proteins. Only a few peptides from known nonribosomal proteins were observed in our 28 S subunit preparations. These peptides represent about 1% of the total spectrum of peptides observed. These peptides originate from two proteins expected to be associated with ribosomes (the chaperones Hsp60 and Hsp70). In addition, peptides were observed from the subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This large oligomeric complex sediments at 32 S (26Behal R.H. DeBuysere M.S. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Olson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31372-31377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which is around the same buoyant density as ribosomal subunits. We believe that the peptide sequence data obtained here combined with the sequences reported previously allows the identification of essentially all of the proteins in the 28 S subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome. The molecular weights of the proteins in the small subunit (following removal of the predicted signal sequence) range from 8.7 to 48.5 kDa (Table II). This range of sizes is in good agreement with the previous spectrum observed in bovine mitochondrial small subunits (4Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pietromonaco S. Denslow N. O'Brien T.W. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have not observed any of the higher molecular mass ribosomal proteins (greater than 49 kDa) reported in rat liver mitochondrial ribosomes by Cahill et al. (5Cahill A. Baio D. Cunningham C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The total calculated molecular mass of the small subunit proteins following removal of the proposed N-terminal signal sequence and using an average molecular mass for the three S18 variants is about 680 kDa. This value combined with the mass of the 12 S rRNA present in the small subunit (about 315 kDa) brings the total estimated molecular mass of the small subunit to 995 kDa. This value is in good agreement with the protein content of the ribosome calculated from the buoyant density of this subunit and the estimated molecular weights of each individual protein from the two-dimensional gels (4Matthews D.E.

Complete truncation of the β2 cytoplasmic domain, but not a truncation that retained the membrane proximal eight residues, resulted in constitutive activation of αLβ2 and αMβ2, demonstrating the importance of this membrane proximal region in the regulation of integrin adhesive function. Furthermore, replacement of the αL and β2 cytoplasmic domains with acidic and basic peptides that form an α-helical coiled coil caused inactivation of αLβ2.

To date, 25 different integrin αβ heterodimers have been reported (1Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The leukocyte integrin subfamily consists of four members that share the common β2 subunit (CD18) but have distinct α subunits, αL (CD11a), αM (CD11b), αX (CD11c), and αD for LFA-1, Mac-1, p150,95 and αD/β2, respectively (2Springer T.A.

LFA-1 is expressed on all leukocytes and is the receptor for three Ig superfamily members, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, -2, and -3 (ICAM1-1, -2 and -3). Mac-1 and p150,95 are primarily expressed on myeloid lineage cells and bind ligands including ICAM-1, the complement component iC3b, and fibrinogen. The leukocyte integrins mediate a wide range of adhesive interactions that are essential for normal immune and inflammatory responses (5Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (5829) Google Scholar). Patients with lymphocyte adhesion deficiency have defective expression of leukocyte integrins on the cell surface because of mutations in the common β2 subunit. This disease causes an inability of phagocytic cells to bind to and migrate across the endothelium at sites of inflammation, resulting in severe bacterial and fungal infections (3Larson R.S. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 114: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).The adhesiveness of leukocyte integrins is dynamically regulated in cells by cytoplasmic signals, a process termed inside-out signaling. For example, T-cell receptor cross-linking or activation of leukocytes with phorbol esters rapidly increases adhesiveness through LFA-1 (6Dustin M.L. Springer T.A.

The enhanced adhesion is transient, and by 30 min after stimulation, cells lose their ability to bind to ICAM-1. This may provide a mechanism for regulating T cell adhesion and de-adhesion with antigen-presenting and target cells. In addition to activation by intracellular signals, divalent cations can directly modulate the ligand-binding function of leukocyte integrins (9Dransfield I. Hogg N.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 854-866PubMed Google Scholar).A key question on integrins is how signals are transduced from the cytoplasm to the ligand-binding site in the extracellular domain. The integrin α and β subunits are both type I transmembrane glycoproteins. Electron microscopy of integrins reveals an overall structure with a globular headpiece connected to the plasma membrane by two long stalks each about 16 nm long (16Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two stalks correspond to the C-terminal portions of the α and β subunits. The headpiece binds ligand and contains the more N-terminal domains, including a predicted β-propeller domain and I domain in the α subunit and an I-like domain in the β subunit. Both conformational change (affinity regulation) and receptor clustering in the membrane (avidity regulation) have been proposed as mechanisms for the enhancement of integrin adhesiveness through inside-out signaling (17Diamond M.S.

These findings demonstrate the importance of the membrane proximal α subunit GFFKR sequence in the regulation of integrin adhesiveness. Partial truncations of the β3 cytoplasmic domain maintain αIIbβ3 in a low affinity state, but complete truncation or deletion of the membrane proximal seven residues causes constitutive ligand binding by αIIbβ3, indicating that this membrane proximal region of the β3 subunit is required to maintain αIIbβ3 in a low affinity state (30Hughes P.E.

It has been suggested that interactions between the α and β subunit cytoplasmic/transmembrane domains that include complementary negatively and positively charged residues restrain integrins in an inactive state (29O'Toole T.E.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); however, how these integrin-associated proteins function in physiological activation of integrins remains unclear.Here we test the hypothesis that association between the membrane proximal regions of the integrin α and β cytoplasmic domains constrains an integrin in the inactive state. We demonstrate that the membrane proximal region of the β2 cytoplasmic domain plays an important role in the formation of cell surface αβ heterodimers and maintenance of αLβ2 and αMβ2 in an inactive state. Replacement of the αL and β2 cytoplasmic domains with acidic and basic peptides that form an α-helical coiled coil renders the integrin inactive in cell types in which wild type αLβ2 is either basally active or inactive, whereas replacement of the cytoplasmic domain with two basic peptides that do not form a heterodimer renders the integrin active in cell types in which wild type αLβ2 is either basally active or inactive. Our findings directly demonstrate that association between the membrane proximal segments of the α and β cytoplasmic domains regulates ligand binding by integrin extracellular domains.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that the membrane proximal region of eight residues in the β2 cytoplasmic domain is required for efficient expression of integrin αLβ2 and αMβ2 heterodimers on the cell surface and for maintenance of these integrins in the inactive state. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that membrane proximal cytoplasmic association between the α and β subunits constrains an integrin in the inactive state, whereas a lack of association between membrane proximal regions activates an integrin.It has been shown previously that partial truncations of the β2 subunit cytoplasmic domain, or mutation of the three contiguous threonines at amino acid residues 736–738 or the phenylalanine at residue 744, abolishes LFA-1 activation by phorbol ester, suggesting that the membrane distal region is involved in the inducible activation of LFA-1 (26Hibbs M.L.

Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A more recent study showed that complete truncation of the β2 cytoplasmic domain activated binding through αLβ2 of K562 transfectants to ICAM-1 (50Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the previous studies did not localize the region in the β2 cytoplasmic domain that maintains LFA-1 in the default inactive state. We have shown that the function of restraining LFA-1 in an inactive state can be localized to a membrane proximal segment with the sequence KALIHLSD. Complete truncation of the β2 cytoplasmic domain, but not truncation after the KALIHLSD sequence, constitutively activated ligand binding by αLβ2. Furthermore, we generalized this observation to another β2 integrin, αMβ2. Moreover, we demonstrated that the KALIHLSD sequence is required for efficient formation of cell surface αLβ2and αMβ2 heterodimers. The membrane proximal sequence in the cytoplasmic domain is conserved among integrin β subunits (50Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Deletion of the membrane proximal seven residues in the β3 cytoplasmic domain results in a constitutively active αIIbβ3 integrin (30Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Similarly, in integrin α subunits, the conserved membrane proximal GFFKR sequence has been shown to be important for regulating integrin αβ heterodimer assembly and adhesive function (27Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar, 29O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Thus, the conserved membrane proximal regions of both integrin α and β cytoplasmic domains control integrin subunit association and ligand binding activity.The mechanism by which membrane proximal cytoplasmic domain segments regulate integrin activity and efficient association of the α and β subunits has been unclear. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that association between these segments regulates ligand binding activity. We replaced the cytoplasmic domains in αLβ2 with peptides that either favor or disfavor association to form an α-helical coiled coil (42O'Shea E.K. Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 658-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Association of the membrane proximal segments was confirmed by reactivity with mAb 2H11 that recognizes the acid and base peptides only when they are associated with one another in a coiled coil heterodimer (40Chang H.-C. Bao Z.-z. Yao Y. Tse A.G.D. Goyarts E.C. Madsen M. Kawasaki E. Brauer P.P. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11408-11412Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We tested the integrin coiled coil fusions in two different cellular contexts, 293T cells and K562 cells, in which wild-type αLβ2 is active and inactive, respectively. 293T transfectants that expressed αLacidβ2base showed little binding to ICAM-1, whereas cells expressing wild-type αLβ2 strongly bound to ICAM-1. The activating mAb CBR LFA-1/2 to the β2 subunit or Mn2+could activate ligand binding by αLacidβ2base, showing that its extracellular domain is competent for activation. Furthermore, αLbaseβ2base, in which association of the cytoplasmic basic peptides is disfavored, was constitutively active when expressed in K562 cells in which wild-type αLβ2 has little basal activity. These findings provide strong evidence that association of membrane proximal cytoplasmic domains renders an integrin inactive, and that lack of association renders an integrin active (Fig. 1 B).Direct association between the membrane proximal GFFKR sequence of the αIIb subunit and the KLLITIHD sequence of the β3 subunit has been proposed previously based on mutational studies (31Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Mutation of Arg-995 in the αIIbGFFKR sequence or Asp-723 in the β3 KLLITIHD sequence resulted in 39–70% activation of αIIbβ3, whereas the complementary mutations αIIb Arg-995→Asp and β3 Asp-723→Arg resulted in a significantly lower activation of 12% (31Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence for association between the αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic domains was presented. Moreover, we cannot generalize this result to β2 integrins, because mutation of the corresponding Asp-709 in the β2 cytoplasmic domain did not activate ligand binding by αLβ2 and αMβ2 (3 and 2% of maximal binding, respectively; data not shown). Thus, mechanisms other than a proposed salt bridge between integrin α and β cytoplasmic domains may regulate integrin adhesiveness. Indeed, despite extensive evidence that mutations of the membrane proximal segments of the integrin cytoplasmic domains are activating, there has to date been no direct evidence that association between these segments, either direct or mediated by integrin-associated proteins, regulates adhesiveness. We have demonstrated for the first time that close spatial proximity between membrane proximal α and β subunit segments maintains integrins in an inactive state and that a lack of association results in activation.The activation state of an integrin is dependent on the cell type in which it is expressed. For example, β2 integrins in K562 cells require activation to bind to ligands, whereas β2integrins are constitutively active in 293T cells, as shown here and previously (25Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Presumably, this is due to differential expression of proteins or other factors that modulate integrin function in different cell types. We examined the effect of the αLβ2 coiled coil fusions in both types of cellular environments. Interestingly, the effect of the coiled coil mutations was independent of cellular environment. Thus, αLacidβ2base was inactive in both K562 and 293T cells, whereas αLbaseβ2base was active in both cell types. The dominance of the peptides over the cellular environments suggests that the factors that modulate differential integrin activity exert their effect by binding to the cytoplasmic domains of the integrins. Activation of these factors by cytoplasmic signals may regulate binding to integrin cytoplasmic domains and hence the transition between inactive and active wild-type integrins (Fig.1 B).We have demonstrated that activating cytoplasmic domain mutations induce or enhance expression of activation epitopes in αLβ2 and αMβ2. For αLβ2, complete truncation of the β2 cytoplasmic domain or replacement of the αL and β2 cytoplasmic domains with the basic peptides exposed the m24 epitope and enhanced KIM127 epitope expression. Both epitopes localize to the β2 subunit. The m24 epitope localizes to loops in the I-like domain that are predicted to be near its metal ion-dependent adhesion-like site (47Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The KIM127 epitope localizes within cysteine-rich repeat 2, to residues 504, 506, and 508 in the C-terminal region (48Lu, C., Ferzly, M., Takagi, J., and Springer, T. A. (2001)J. Immunol., in press.Google Scholar). For αMβ2, complete truncation of the β2 cytoplasmic domain greatly increased expression of the CBRM1/5 epitope in the αM I domain, as well as the KIM127 epitope in β2. CBRM1/5 binds to the αM I domain very close to the ligand binding site (39Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 45Oxvig C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the activating cytoplasmic domain mutations cause conformational changes in diverse extracellular domains of αLβ2 and αMβ2. It has previously been shown that complete truncation of the β2 cytoplasmic domain alters the localization of LFA-1 into clusters, and hence increases cell adhesion (50Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that conformational change (affinity regulation), as well as receptor clustering (avidity regulation) play a role in the enhanced adhesiveness of αLβ2and αMβ2 induced by activating cytoplasmic domain mutations.We propose the following model for integrin activation (Fig.1 B). The membrane proximal regions of the α and β subunit cytoplasmic domains can associate either directly or indirectly. Under physiological conditions, there is an equilibrium between the association and dissociation of the membrane proximal segments of the cytoplasmic domains that is dynamically regulated. Association constrains the integrin in the inactive state, and dissociation results in activation. Inside-out signaling and integrin binding proteins regulate this equilibrium. Separation of the two membrane proximal regions results in activation. Truncation of the α or β subunit cytoplasmic domain or deletion of the membrane proximal region disrupts this constraint, and activates the integrin. The inactive and active states of an integrin can be mimicked by replacing the integrin cytoplasmic domains with peptides that favor or disfavor, respectively, noncovalent association into a coiled coil. Thus, association of membrane proximal cytoplasmic segments is sufficient to regulate integrin activation and conformational change. Integrins are heterodimeric adhesion molecules that mediate important cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. To date, 25 different integrin αβ heterodimers have been reported (1Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The leukocyte integrin subfamily consists of four members that share the common β2 subunit (CD18) but have distinct α subunits, αL (CD11a), αM (CD11b), αX (CD11c), and αD for LFA-1, Mac-1, p150,95 and αD/β2, respectively (2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar, 3Larson R.S. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 114: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 4Van der Vieren M. Trong H.L. Wood C.L. Moore P.F. St. John T. Staunton D.E. Gallatin W.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). LFA-1 is expressed on all leukocytes and is the receptor for three Ig superfamily members, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, -2, and -3 (ICAM1-1, -2 and -3). Mac-1 and p150,95 are primarily expressed on myeloid lineage cells and bind ligands including ICAM-1, the complement component iC3b, and fibrinogen. The leukocyte integrins mediate a wide range of adhesive interactions that are essential for normal immune and inflammatory responses (5Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (5829) Google Scholar). Patients with lymphocyte adhesion deficiency have defective expression of leukocyte integrins on the cell surface because of mutations in the common β2 subunit. This disease causes an inability of phagocytic cells to bind to and migrate across the endothelium at sites of inflammation, resulting in severe bacterial and fungal infections (3Larson R.S. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 114: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The adhesiveness of leukocyte integrins is dynamically regulated in cells by cytoplasmic signals, a process termed inside-out signaling. For example, T-cell receptor cross-linking or activation of leukocytes with phorbol esters rapidly increases adhesiveness through LFA-1 (6Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 7van Kooyk Y. van de Wiel-van Kemenade P. Weder P. Kuijpers T.W. Figdor C.G.

The enhanced adhesion is transient, and by 30 min after stimulation, cells lose their ability to bind to ICAM-1. This may provide a mechanism for regulating T cell adhesion and de-adhesion with antigen-presenting and target cells. In addition to activation by intracellular signals, divalent cations can directly modulate the ligand-binding function of leukocyte integrins (9Dransfield I. Hogg N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3759-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 10Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J.

Activation can also be mimicked by certain antibodies that bind to the extracellular domain of the leukocyte integrins (12Keizer G.D. Visser W. Vliem M. Figdor C.G. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1393-1400PubMed Google Scholar, 13Robinson M.K. Andrew D. Rosen H. Brown D. Ortlepp S. Stephens P. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1080-1085PubMed Google Scholar, 14Andrew D.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 854-866PubMed Google Scholar). A key question on integrins is how signals are transduced from the cytoplasm to the ligand-binding site in the extracellular domain. The integrin α and β subunits are both type I transmembrane glycoproteins. Electron microscopy of integrins reveals an overall structure with a globular headpiece connected to the plasma membrane by two long stalks each about 16 nm long (16Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two stalks correspond to the C-terminal portions of the α and β subunits. The headpiece binds ligand and contains the more N-terminal domains, including a predicted β-propeller domain and I domain in the α subunit and an I-like domain in the β subunit. Both conformational change (affinity regulation) and receptor clustering in the membrane (avidity regulation) have been proposed as mechanisms for the enhancement of integrin adhesiveness through inside-out signaling (17Diamond M.S.

Since calpain activation was suspected in β-Lap-mediated apoptosis, we examined alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis using NQO1-expressing MCF-7 cells. β-Lap-exposed MCF-7 cells exhibited an early increase in intracellular cytosolic Ca2+, from endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, comparable to thapsigargin exposures. 1,2-Bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester, an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, blocked early increases in Ca2+ levels and inhibited β-Lap-mediated mitochondrial membrane depolarization, intracellular ATP depletion, specific and unique substrate proteolysis, and apoptosis. The extracellular Ca2+ chelator, EGTA, inhibited later apoptotic end points (observed >8 h, e.g. substrate proteolysis and DNA fragmentation), suggesting that later execution events were triggered by Ca2+ influxes from the extracellular milieu.

Apoptosis is a highly regulated, active process that requires the participation of endogenous cellular enzymes that systematically dismantle the cell. The most well characterized proteases in apoptosis are caspases, aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, that work through a cascade that can be initiated by mitochondrial membrane depolarization leading to the release of cytochrome c and Apaf-1 into the cytoplasm (10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6154) Google Scholar), that then activates caspase 9 (11Eguchi Y. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2174-2181PubMed Google Scholar). Non-caspase-mediated pathways are less understood. We previously showed that apoptosis following β-Lap administration was unique, in that an ∼60-kDa PARP cleavage fragment, as well as distinct intracellular proteolytic cleavage of p53, were observed in NQO1-expressing breast or prostate cancer cells (5Pink J.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).2 These cleavage events were distinct from those observed when caspases were activated by topoisomerase I poisons, staurosporine, or administration of granzyme B (5Pink J.J.

Furthermore, β-Lap-mediated cleavage events were blocked by administration of global cysteine protease inhibitors, as well as extracellular Ca2+ chelators (12Pink J.J. Wuerzberger-Davis S. Tagliarino C. Planchon S.M. Yang X. Froelich C.J. Boothman D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we concluded that β-Lap exposure of NQO1-expressing breast and prostate cancer cells caused the activation of a Ca2+-dependent protease with properties similar to calpain; in particular, the p53 cleavage pattern of β-Lap-exposed cells was remarkably similar to the pattern observed after calpain activation (14Pariat M.

Blood. 1998; 91: 731-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fang M. Zhang H. Xue S. Li N. Wang L. Cancer Lett. 1998; 127: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Marks A.R. Am. J.

The cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration is maintained at ∼100 nm in resting cells by relatively impermeable cell membranes, active extrusion of Ca2+ from the cell by plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases, plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, and active uptake of cytosolic Ca2+ into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by distinct Ca2+-ATPases. In contrast, the concentration of Ca2+ in the extracellular milieu and in the ER is much higher (in the millimolar range). Evidence for involvement of Ca2+ influx into the cytosol as a triggering event for apoptosis has come from studies with specific Ca2+ channel blockers that abrogate apoptosis in regressing prostate following testosterone withdrawal (22Martikainen P. Isaacs J. Prostate. 1990; 17: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Other support for the involvement of Ca2+ in apoptosis comes from the observation that agents that directly mobilize Ca2+ (e.g.Ca2+ ionophores or the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump inhibitor, thapsigargin, TG) can trigger apoptosis in diverse cell types (23Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 24Kaneko Y. Tsukamoto A.

Butash K. Davidson N.E. Denmeade S.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2844-2850PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump by TG causes a transient increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ from ER Ca2+ stores, and a later influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular milieu, leading to the induction of apoptotic cell death (24Kaneko Y. Tsukamoto A. Cancer Lett. 1994; 79: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Jackisch C. Hahm H.A. Tombal B. McCloskey D. Butash K. Davidson N.E. Denmeade S.R. Clin.

Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consequently, emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores may trigger apoptosis by disrupting the intracellular architecture and allowing key elements of the effector machinery (e.g. Apaf-1) to gain access to their substrates (e.g. caspase 9). Ca2+ has also been shown to be necessary for apoptotic endonuclease activation, eliciting DNA cleavage after many cellular insults (29Yakovlev A.G. Wang G. Stoica B.A. Boulares H.A. Spoonde A.Y.

Buffering intracellular Ca2+ released from stored Ca2+ pools (e.g. ER) with BAPTA-AM, or removal of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA, can protect cells against apoptosis (32McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Wyllie A.H. Orrenius S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar,33Srivastava R.K. Sollott S.J. Khan L. Hansford R. Lakatta E.G. Longo D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5659-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels appear to be important cell death signals in human cancer cells that might be exploited for anti-tumor therapy. Finally, Ca2+may act as a signal for apoptosis by directly activating key proapoptotic enzymes (e.g. calpain); however, these proteolytic responses are poorly understood. The role of Ca2+ in cell death processes involving caspase activation has been examined in detail (28McColl K.S. He H. Zhong H. Whitacre C.M. Berger N.A. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Wertz I.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

However, the role of Ca2+ in non-caspase-dependent cell death responses is relatively unexplored. Recent studies have suggested that alterations in mitochondrial homeostasis play an essential role in apoptotic signal transduction induced by cytotoxic agents (37Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Various apoptotic stimuli have been shown to induce mitochondrial changes, resulting in release of apoptogenic factors, apoptosis-inducing factor (39Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3414) Google Scholar), and mitochondrial cytochrome c (9Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4239) Google Scholar) into the cytoplasm. These changes are observed during the early phases of apoptosis in human epithelial cells, and were linked to the initial cascade of events, sending the cell to an irreversible suicide pathway. During high, sustained levels of cytosolic Ca2+, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is driven by mitochondrial membrane potential to maintain Ca2+homeostasis in the cytosol. In de-energized mitochondria, Ca2+ can be released by a reversal of this uptake pathway (40Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These data, therefore, linked changes in Ca2+homeostasis and mitochondrial membrane potential to the initiation of apoptosis. Li et al. (41Li Y.Z. Li C.J. Pinto A.V. Pardee A.B. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 232-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that β-Lap caused a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential with release of cytochromec into the cytoplasm in a number of human carcinoma cell lines, shortly after drug addition. Other alterations in metabolism (e.g. ATP depletion) have not been examined in β-Lap-treated cells. We previously characterized the activation of a novel cysteine protease in various breast cancer cell lines with properties similar to the Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, calpain, after exposure to β-Lap (12Pink J.J. Wuerzberger-Davis S. Tagliarino C. Planchon S.M. Yang X. Froelich C.J. Boothman D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Using NQO1-expressing breast cancer cells, we show that β-Lap elicits a rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels shortly after drug administration that eventually leads to apoptosis. This paper suggests a critical, but not sufficient, role for Ca2+ in the cell death pathway initiated by NQO1-dependent bioactivation of β-Lap. Possible combinatorial effects (e.g. NAD(P)H depletion as well as intracellular calcium alterations) that initiate β-Lap-mediated apoptosis in NQO1-expressing breast cancer cells will be discussed. β-Lapachone (3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphtho[1,2b]pyran-5,6-dione) was synthesized by Dr. William G. Bornmann (Memorial Sloan Kettering, New York), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mm, and the concentration verified by spectrophotometric analysis (2Wuerzberger S.M. Pink J.J. Planchon S.M.

BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra-(acetoxymethyl ester)) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). JC-1 (5,5′6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide) and Fluo-4-AM were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). MCF-7:WS8 (MCF-7) human breast cancer cells were obtained from Dr. V. Craig Jordan, (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). MDA-MB-468 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and transfected with NQO1 cDNA in the pcDNA3 constitutive expression vector as described previously (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M.

Tissue culture components were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., unless otherwise stated. MCF-7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere as previously described (2Wuerzberger S.M.

For all experiments, log-phase breast cancer cells were exposed to 5 μm β-Lap for 4 h (unless otherwise indicated), after which fresh medium was added and cells were harvested at various times post-treatment. Cells were seeded at 1 × 106cells/10-cm Petri dish and allowed to grow for 24 h. Log-phase cells were then pretreated for 30 min with 10 μmBAPTA-AM, 3 mm EGTA, or 50 μm dicumarol followed by a 4-h pulse of 5 μm β-Lap, as described above, or 24 h treatment of 10 μm ionomycin or 1 μm staurosporine. Medium was collected from experimental as well as control conditions 24 h later, and attached along with floating cells were monitored for apoptosis using TUNEL 3′-biotinylated DNA end labeling via the APO-DIRECT kit (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) as described (5Pink J.J.

Apoptotic cells were analyzed and quantified using an EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer that contained an air-cooled argon laser at 488 nm, 15 mW (Beckman Coulter Electronics; Miami, Fl), and XL-MCL acquisition software provided with the instrument. MCF-7 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells per well in a 12-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. The following day, log-phase cells were pretreated for 30 min with 5 μm BAPTA-AM, followed by a 4-h pulse of β-Lap (0–5 μm). Drugs were removed and fresh medium added. Cells were allowed to grow for an additional 6 days. DNA content (a measure of cell growth) was determined by fluorescence using Hoechst dye 33258 as described (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and changes in growth were monitored using a PerkinElmer HTS 7000 Plus Bio Assay Plate Reader (Norwalk, CT) with 360 and 465 nm excitation and emission filters, respectively. Data were expressed as relative growth, T/C (treated/control), using experiments performed at least twice. MCF-7 cells were seeded at 2–3 × 105 cells per 35-mm glass bottom Petri dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were rinsed twice in a Ca2+/Mg2+ balanced salt solution (BSS, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator, fluo-4-AM (5 μm), in BSS for ∼20–30 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed twice in BSS and incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C to allow for hydrolysis of the AM-ester. Cells were imaged with a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY) equipped with a ×63 N.A. 1.4 oil immersion planapochromat objective at room temperature (the same results were observed at room temperature and 37 °C). Confocal images of fluo-4 fluorescence were collected using a 488-nm excitation light from an argon/krypton laser, a 560-nm dichroic mirror, and a 500–550 nm band-pass barrier filter. Three basal images were collected before drug addition (8 μm β-Lap, ± 50 μm dicumarol or 200 nm TG). The mean pixel intensity was set to equal one for analyses of fold-increase in fluo-4 fluorescence intensity. Subsequently, images were collected after the indicated treatments at 90-s intervals. BAPTA-AM (20 μm) was co-loaded with fluo-4-AM where indicated. Mean pixels were determined in regions of interest for individual cells at each time point. MCF-7 cells were seeded at 2.5–3 × 105 cells per 6-well plate, and allowed to grow for 24 h. Log-phase cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm BAPTA-AM, 3 mm EGTA, or 50 μm dicumarol followed by a 4-h pulse of 5 μm β-Lap, unless otherwise indicated. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in phenol red-minus RPMI medium for analyses. Cells were maintained at 37 °C for the duration of the experiment, including during analyses. Prior to analyses, cells were loaded with 10 μg/ml JC-1 for 9–14 min and samples were analyzed using a Beckman Coulter EPICS Elite ESP (Miami, FL) flow cytometer. JC-1 monomer and aggregate emissions were excited at 488 nmand quantified using Elite acquisition software after signal collection through 525- and 590-nm band pass filters, respectfully. Shifts in emission spectra were plotted on bivariant dot plots, on a cell-by-cell basis, to determine relative mitochondrial membrane potential of treated and control cells. Cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well dishes and allowed to attach for 24 h. Fresh medium was added to the cells along with Ca2+ chelators or dicumarol 30 min prior to β-Lap exposure (4 h unless otherwise indicated). Floating cells were collected, pelleted, and lysed in 1.67 m perchloric acid. Attached cells were lysed directly in 1.67 m perchloric acid. Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, attached cells were scraped and transferred to corresponding microcentrifuge tube, cooled on ice for several minutes, and spun to pellet protein precipitates. Deproteinized samples were neutralized with 3.5m KOH and HEPES/KOH (25 mm HEPES, 15 mm KOH, pH 8), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Precipitates were removed by centrifugation and samples stored at −20 °C. Cell extracts were analyzed for ATP and ADP levels using a luciferase-based bioluminescent assay and rephosphorylation protocols, as described (42Beigi R.D. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7189-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from control or β-Lap-exposed MCF-7 cells were prepared and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Western blot analyses as previously described (2Wuerzberger S.M.

Loading equivalence and transfer efficiency were monitored by Western blot analyses of proteins that are known to be unaltered by experimental treatments (2Wuerzberger S.M. Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Byers K.L. Bornmann W.G. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1876-1885PubMed Google Scholar), and using Ponceau S staining of the membrane, respectively. Probed membranes were then exposed to x-ray film for an appropriate time and developed. Dilutions of 1:10,000 for the C-2–10 anti-PARP antibody (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA), and 1:2000 for anti-p53 DO-1 and anti-lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies were used as described (2Wuerzberger S.M.

Log-phase MCF-7 cells were treated for 4 h with 5 μm β-Lap, fresh medium was then applied, and cells were harvested 24 h later and analyzed for DNA fragmentation (i.e. apoptotic cells staining positive in a TUNEL assay). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with β-Lap resulted in >90% apoptotic cells (Fig.1, A and B). However, MCF-7 cells exposed to a 30-min pretreatment with 10 μm BAPTA-AM or 3 mm EGTA, followed by a 4-h pulse of 5 μm β-Lap, exhibited only 20 or 39% apoptotic cells, respectively, in 24 h. To examine whether BAPTA-AM could affect β-Lap lethality, we measured relative growth of MCF-7 cells with or without exposure to β-Lap, and in the presence or absence of BAPTA-AM. MCF-7 cells were treated for 30 min with 5 μm BAPTA-AM, subsequently exposed to a 4-h pulse of β-Lap (1.5−5 μm), and relative cell growth was measured 6 days later (Fig. 1 C). The LD50dose of β-Lap in MCF-7 cells was ∼2.5 μm in colony forming assays, which correlated well with IC50 relative growth inhibition, as measured by DNA content (2Wuerzberger S.M. Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Byers K.L. Bornmann W.G. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1876-1885PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). At 1.5 μm β-Lap, cells exhibited little or no toxicity. At β-Lap doses of 3 or 5 μm, cells exhibited considerable toxicity, >90% growth inhibition, as previously reported (2Wuerzberger S.M. Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Byers K.L. Bornmann W.G. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1876-1885PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol.

BAPTA-AM pretreated cells exhibit only 44 and 73% growth inhibition after 3 or 5 μm β-Lap treatments, respectively (Fig. 1 C). BAPTA alone did not affect MCF-7 cell growth compared with untreated controls. It was possible based on the data in Fig. 1 that calcium chelators may block β-Lap-mediated apoptosis by sequestering calcium required for the activation of apoptotic endonucleases. We, therefore, examined both intra- and extracellular Ca2+ chelators for their ability to prevent apoptosis in NQO1-transfected MDA-468 (MDA-468-NQ3) cells induced by β-Lap, ionomycin (which induces Ca2+-mediated cell death (36Petersen A. Castilho R.F. Hansson O. Wieloch T. Brundin P.

https://openalex.org/W1992897184,"The excision of nucleotides from DNA 3′ termini is an important step in DNA replication, repair, and recombination pathways to generate correctly base paired termini for subsequent processing. The mammalian TREX1 and TREX2 proteins contain potent 3′→5′ exonucleases capable of functioning in this capacity. To study the activities of these exonucleases we have developed strategies to express and purify the recombinant mouse Trex1 and human TREX2 proteins in Escherichia coli in quantities sufficient for biochemical characterization. The Trex1 and TREX2 proteins are homodimers that exhibit robust 3′ excision activities with very similar preferred reaction conditions and preferences for specific DNA substrates. In a steady-state kinetic analysis, oligonucleotide substrates were used to measure 3′ nucleotide excision by Trex1 and TREX2. The Michaelis constants derived from these data indicate similar apparent kcat values of 22 s−1 for Trex1 and 16 s−1 for TREX2 using single-stranded oligonucleotides. The apparent KM values of 19 nm for Trex1 and 190 nm for TREX2 suggest relatively high affinities for DNA for both Trex1 and TREX2. An exonuclease competition assay was designed using heparin as a nonsubstrate inhibitor with a series of partial duplex DNAs to delineate the substrate structure preferences for 3′ nucleotide excision by Trex1 and TREX2. The catalytic properties of the TREX proteins suggest roles for these enzymes in the 3′ end-trimming processes necessary for producing correctly base paired 3′ termini. The excision of nucleotides from DNA 3′ termini is an important step in DNA replication, repair, and recombination pathways to generate correctly base paired termini for subsequent processing. The mammalian TREX1 and TREX2 proteins contain potent 3′→5′ exonucleases capable of functioning in this capacity. To study the activities of these exonucleases we have developed strategies to express and purify the recombinant mouse Trex1 and human TREX2 proteins in Escherichia coli in quantities sufficient for biochemical characterization. The Trex1 and TREX2 proteins are homodimers that exhibit robust 3′ excision activities with very similar preferred reaction conditions and preferences for specific DNA substrates. In a steady-state kinetic analysis, oligonucleotide substrates were used to measure 3′ nucleotide excision by Trex1 and TREX2. The Michaelis constants derived from these data indicate similar apparent kcat values of 22 s−1 for Trex1 and 16 s−1 for TREX2 using single-stranded oligonucleotides. The apparent KM values of 19 nm for Trex1 and 190 nm for TREX2 suggest relatively high affinities for DNA for both Trex1 and TREX2. An exonuclease competition assay was designed using heparin as a nonsubstrate inhibitor with a series of partial duplex DNAs to delineate the substrate structure preferences for 3′ nucleotide excision by Trex1 and TREX2. The catalytic properties of the TREX proteins suggest roles for these enzymes in the 3′ end-trimming processes necessary for producing correctly base paired 3′ termini. polymerase E. coli exonuclease I E. coliexonuclease X Three prime RepairEXonuclease Werner syndrome protein APurinic/apyrimidinic EXonuclease polymerase chain reaction expressed sequence tags maltose binding protein single-strand DNA polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin The 3′→5′ exonucleases are frequently required in DNA repair pathways to excise mismatched, modified, fragmented, or normal nucleotides from DNA 3′ termini. The proteins containing 3′→5′ exonuclease activity are in some cases large multiple-domain proteins, such as the proofreading exonucleases associated with many of the DNA polymerases, and in other cases small single-domain proteins. Multiple sequence alignments have been used with structural and mutagenesis studies of the 3′ exonuclease domains of Escherichia coliDNA pol1 I and bacteriophage T4 DNA pol to define the core sequence, structural, and functional elements of an exonuclease domain (1Moser M.J.

In these 3′ exonucleases a two-metal ion mechanism of nucleotide cleavage is indicated with four negatively charged Asp or Glu residues and a Tyr residue located within three conserved motifs, named ExoI, ExoII, and ExoIII. These carboxylate residues in the Exo motifs identify DNA and RNA 3′ exonucleases that likely share a common catalytic mechanism for nucleotide cleavage. A subset of the 3′ exonucleases contains a His rather than a Tyr in the ExoIII motif that is referred to as the ExoIIIε motif (8Barnes M.H. Spacciapoli P. Li D.H. Brown N.C.

Analysis of the TREX protein sequences using the COGNITOR program (available on the Web from NIH) suggests a possible relationship with proteins included in the “DnaQ” Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins (17Tatusov R.L.

Chem. 1985; 260: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but a more recent report describes the potent 3′ deoxyribonuclease activity of this protein (29Viswanathan M. Dower K.W. Lovett S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35126-35131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments indicate that DNA repair defects resulting from deficiencies in ExoI can be complemented by overexpression of RNase T (30Viswanathan M. Lanjuin A. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 929-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although direct evidence for functional roles in DNA repair is not available for the TREX proteins, the ubiquitous expression of the TREX1 and TREX2 genes in human cells supports a role for these 3′ exonucleases in DNA repair pathways (16Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14718-14727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In a reconstituted base-excision repair system containing DNA pol β and DNA ligase IV-XRCC1, the accurate rejoining of a 3′ mismatch base at a single-strand break is dependent on addition of the TREX1 (also referred to as DNase III) protein (31Hoss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-38675Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The availability of the TREX gene sequences has made it possible to generate recombinant proteins in sufficient quantities to explore the biochemical properties of these mammalian 3′→5′ exonucleases. We recently reported that the human and mouseTREX1 gene encodes a protein of 314 amino acids in length (16Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14718-14727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and not 304 as previously indicated (15Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-38675Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The human and mouseTREX2 gene encodes a protein of 236 amino acids in length. To begin characterization of the TREX proteins we developed strategies to generate purified recombinant mouse Trex1 2The murine orthologs of TREX have the approved symbols of Trex1 and Trex2. and human TREX2 proteins. These proteins were used to measure the catalytic constants that govern 3′ nucleotide excision. A competition assay was designed to permit a comparative analysis of 3′ nucleotide excision using DNA substrates with varying structures at the 3′ termini. The results presented here demonstrate the high catalytic efficiencies of the TREX proteins that parallel the potent exonuclease activities detected in some bacterial enzymes. [γ-32P]ATP, Superdex 200, MonoQ, MonoS, and Phenyl-Superose columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phosphocellulose (P-11) was from Whatman. The heparin (H5027) and ssDNA cellulose (D8273) were from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Amylose resin and pMAL-c2 plasmid were from New England BioLabs. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified in the Cancer Center of Wake Forest University. T4 polynucleotide kinase and pGEM-T Easy Vector were fromPromega Corp. The mouse Trex1 EST (GenBank™ accession number AA242227) was purchased from Research Genetics. The humanTREX2-containing COSMID (GenBank™ accession numberAF002998) was a generous gift from G. Nordsiek (Institute for Molecular Biotechnology, Germany). The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and XL1-Blue (Stratagene) were used for protein expression. The mouse Trex1 gene was recovered from the EST GenBank™ accession number AA242227 by PCR using the primers 5′-CTCAGGAGGTAAAAAAGCATGGGCTCACAGA-3′ and 5′-TTGACTTACTGCCCAGGT-3′ and cloned into the pOXO4 vector (32Parsonage D. Miller H. Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate the pTrex1-314 vector. In this vector, transcription of the complete 314-amino acid Trex1 open reading frame is under control of the T7 promoter. Translation is controlled by the ribosome-binding site engineered into the sequence of the PCR primer at a position eight nucleotides from the initiating ATG of the 942-nucleotideTrex1 gene. The human TREX2 gene was recovered from the COSMID clone GenBank™ accession number AF002998 by PCR using the primers 5′-TTCGGATCCTCTAGACCGGGTGCGGCACACTACATGTCCGAGGCACCCCG-3′ and 5′-ATTCAGGCCTCCAGGCT-3′ and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector. The nucleotide sequence encoding the Genenase cleavage sequence (Pro-Gly-Ala-Ala-His-Tyr) was engineered in-frame into the upstreamTREX2 PCR primer at a 5′ adjacent position to the initiating ATG of the TREX2 gene. The cloned TREX2 gene was recovered from the pGEM vector by digestion with XbaI andSalI and was ligated into theXbaI/SalI-digested pMAL-c2 plasmid to generate a pMAL-TREX2 vector. Expression from the pMAL-TREX2 vector generates transcripts encoding fusion protein MBPTREX2. The position of the Genenase recognition sequence permits cleavage of the fusion protein to generate a 236-amino acid TREX2 protein. The sequences of the pTrex1-314 and pMAL-TREX2 vectors were determined in both directions using an automated DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences ABI Prism 377). For overexpression of the Trex1 protein, pTrex1-314 plasmid was electroporated into E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown in LB (3 liters) at 25 °C toA595 = 0.2, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm for an additional 12 h at 25 °C. An extract was prepared by cell sonication in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol), and the Trex1 protein was purified by sequential chromatography using phosphocellulose, MonoQ, ssDNA cellulose, MonoS, and Phenyl-Superose resins equilibrated in buffer A. The 3′→5′ exonuclease activity was monitored upon elution from the phosphocellulose and MonoQ columns using a standard exonuclease assay. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining were used to monitor subsequent steps. A clarified extract was loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (4.9 cm2 × 15 cm), and the column was washed with buffer A and developed with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0–1000 mmNaCl in buffer A. The peak of 3′→5′ exonuclease activity eluted from the column at 600 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and loaded onto a MonoQ column 10/10. The MonoQ column was washed and developed with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl. The peak of 3′→5′ exonuclease activity eluted from the MonoQ column at 20 mm NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and loaded onto a ssDNA cellulose column (2 cm2 × 5 cm). The column was washed, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. Eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer A loaded onto a MonoS column 10/10. The column was washed and developed with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl. The Trex1 protein eluted from the MonoS column at 20 mm NaCl. Ammonium sulfate was added to pooled fractions to a final concentration of 25% saturation. The sample was loaded onto a Phenyl-Superose column 10/10 equilibrated with buffer A containing 25% ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer and developed with a 100-ml decreasing linear gradient of buffer A containing 25–0% ammonium sulfate. The Trex1 protein eluted from the Phenyl-Superose column at 15% ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing Trex1 were pooled, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. For overexpression of the MBPTREX2 fusion protein the pMAL-TREX2 plasmid was electroporated into E. coli XL1 Blue. Cells were grown in LB at 37 °C to A595 = 0.5, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. A cell extract was prepared by sonication in buffer A, and fusion protein MBPTREX2 was affinity-purified using an amylose resin as described by the manufacturer. The 236-amino acid TREX2 protein was cleaved from the MBPTREX2 fusion protein by incubation at 25 °C with Genenase (1 mg of Genenase/100 mg of TREX2MBP). The cleavage reaction was dialyzed against buffer A and loaded onto a MonoQ 10/10 column equilibrated with buffer A. The MonoQ column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A and developed with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. The TREX2 protein eluted at 180 mmNaCl. Glycerol was added to the purified TREX2 protein to a final concentration of 10%, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. A Superdex 200 column was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. The protein mixtures (50 μg of each standard and Trex1 or TREX2) were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and samples (200 μl) were applied to the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (250 μl) were collected after a discarded volume of 9–10 ml. Samples of fractions were concentrated in Microcons (Amicon), suspended in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The standard exonuclease reactions (10 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 12.5 nm 5′-32P-labeled 23-mer oligonucleotide, and TREX proteins (1–5 pg) as indicated in the figure and table legends. Incubations were at 37 °C for the times indicated. For the kinetic analysis a 5′-32P-labeled 21-mer or 37-mer:21-mer partial duplex at concentrations that varied between 1 and 2000 nm and TREX proteins (5 pg) were used to generate initial estimates of Km values. Reactions containing substrate concentrations between 0.1 and 5 ×Km values were performed for determination of the kinetic constants. The exonuclease competition assays included heparin (1 mg/ml) as a nonsubstrate inhibitor to compete with the various partial duplex DNA substrates (1 nm) as described in the figure legends. The amounts of Trex1 (100 pg) and TREX2 (1 ng) were increased in these assays to detect 3′ excision of the 5′-32P-labeled DNA substrates. Hybridization of oligomers to generate partial duplexes has been described (33Perrino F.W. Mekosh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23043-23051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched by addition of 30 μl of cold ethanol and dried in vacuo. Pellets were resuspended in 7 μl of formamide, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and separated on 23% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Linear regression and standard errors were determined using SigmaPlot 5.0 (Jandel Corp.). All enzyme dilutions were at 4 °C in 1 mg/ml BSA. The protein concentrations were determined by A280 using the following molar extinction coefficients: Trex1, ε = 25,110; MBPTREX2, ε = 82,860; TREX2, ε = 16,860 m−1cm−1 (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). The open reading frames for the human and mouse TREX1 genes encode proteins of 314 amino acids in length (16Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14718-14727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previous attempts to overexpress the TREX1 protein in E. coli utilized gene constructs encoding amino acids 11–314 and resulted in the recovery of active TREX1 exonuclease in limited quantities (15Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19655-19660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 31Hoss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-38675Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cloning of the 314-amino acid TREX1 open reading frame into a T7 RNA polymerase expression vector has dramatically improved protein expression levels using the mouse Trex1 gene, resulting in the purification of ∼1 mg of Trex1 per liter of bacterial cell extract (Fig.1). In contrast, the same expression system has not improved yields of the recombinant human TREX1 protein (data not shown). To generate the Trex1 protein, an E. coliextract was prepared from induced cells containing the pTrex1-314 vector. Exonuclease assays demonstrate a 2000-fold greater activity in extracts prepared from induced cells containing the pTrex1-314 vector relative to extracts prepared from cells containing the pOXO4 control plasmid. The Trex1 protein was purified by sequential chromatography using phosphocellulose, MonoQ, ssDNA cellulose, MonoS, and Phenyl-Superose resins. Analysis of induced cell extracts by SDS-PAGE does not reveal an obvious overproduction of the Trex1 protein (Fig. 1, lane 2). Therefore, exonuclease assays were performed to detect the Trex1 protein through the MonoQ chromatography step, and SDS-PAGE was used to monitor purification in subsequent steps. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the pooled fractions from the MonoQ column (Fig. 1, lane 4) reveals the presence of the full-length Trex1 protein migrating to a position corresponding to 33 kDa and a fragment of Trex1 at the 30-kDa position. The identity of the Trex1 fragment was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis. The Trex1 fragment represents more than 50% of the overexpressed protein recovered from the MonoQ column (Fig. 1, lane 4). The full-length Trex1 protein is enriched to greater than 75% in subsequent steps by monitoring the purification using SDS-PAGE and selectively pooling fractions containing the full-length Trex1 protein (Fig. 1, lanes 4–7). This purified Trex1 protein was used in subsequent experiments. The human and mouse TREX2 genes encode a 236-amino acid protein that has not been previously purified from an endogenous source, nor had the recombinant TREX2 protein been produced. An expression strategy was developed to produce a MBPTREX2 fusion protein that could be cleaved using Genenase to permit purification of the 236-amino acid TREX2 protein (Fig. 2). AnE. coli extract was prepared from induced cells containing the pMAL-TREX2 vector, and the MBPTREX2 fusion protein was affinity-purified using an amylose resin (Fig. 2, lane 2). The MBPTREX2 protein was incubated with Genenase in a time course reaction to determine the optimal conditions for cleavage to generate the MBP and the TREX2 protein (Fig. 2, lanes 3–6). Greater than 90% cleavage of the fusion protein is obtained with minimal degradation of the TREX2 protein. Chromatography of the cleaved fusion protein using a MonoQ resin results in purification of the TREX2 protein with yields of ∼0.5 mg of protein per liter of bacterial cell extract (Fig. 2, lane 7). This purified TREX2 protein was used in subsequent experiments. Several experiments were performed to begin enzymatic and physical characterization of the recombinant Trex1 and TREX2 proteins. The Trex1 and TREX2 proteins were examined for 3′→5′ exonuclease activity using a single-stranded oligomer to confirm the presence of this activity in the recombinant proteins and to establish the relative 3′ nucleotide excision rates for these enzymes (Fig.3). Incubation of increased amounts of Trex1 (Fig. 3, lanes 1–5) or TREX2 (Fig. 3, lanes 6–10) results in degradation of a 23-mer at similar rates. The picogram quantities of enzyme required to detect the 3′→5′ exonuclease activity of Trex1 are consistent with previous estimates of the activity for this enzyme purified from mammalian cells (35Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Perrino F.W. Mazur D.J. Ward H. Harvey S. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 331-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results also indicate similar catalytic efficiencies for Trex1 and TREX2. An analysis of reaction requirements was performed to establish optimal conditions for Trex1 and TREX2 3′→5′ exonuclease activities (Table I). These results demonstrate that very similar conditions are required for Trex1 and TREX2. Both enzymes prefer the Mg2+ divalent cation with maximal activity detected at a concentration of 5 mm. Both enzymes can utilize Mn2+ with decreased activities detected, and neither enzyme can utilize Zn2+ for catalysis. The Trex1 and TREX2 activities are inhibited by NaCl or KCl at concentrations above 50 mm, are stabilized by the addition of at least 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and exhibit pH optima in the range of 7.5–8.0 (Table I). The similar reaction conditions required for Trex1 and TREX2 likely reflect similar catalytic mechanisms.Table IReaction requirements for Trex1 and TREX2ActivityTrex1TREX2%MgCl2 [mm]0000.11629164685100100255566MnCl2 [mm]0000.111 (22) 1-aActivity (%) relative to the same concentration of MgCl2.51 (50) 1-aActivity (%) relative to the same concentration of MgCl2.137 (19) 1-aActivity (%) relative to the same concentration of MgCl2.60 (26) 1-aActivity (%) relative to the same concentration of MgCl2.5100 (33) 1-aActivity (%) relative to the same concentration of MgCl2.100 (39) 1-aActivity (%) relative to the same concentration of MgCl2.2582 (49) 1-aActivity (%) relative to the same concentration of MgCl2.86 (56) 1-aActivity (%) relative to the same concentration of MgCl2.ZnCl2 [mm]0.1–2500NaCl [mm] 1-bSimilar results were obtained with the same concentrations of KCl.010095197100109689506152150131430033BSA (mg/ml)0320.0118110.195951.0100100pH6.541107.064437.5100948.0811008.568569.04654Standard 3′→5′ exonuclease reactions were prepared using 5 pg of Trex1 or TREX2 and the indicated reaction modification.

Previous gel filtration analysis of TREX1 purified from mammalian sources indicated a native molecular mass consistent with a dimer structure (31Hoss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-38675Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 35Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the dimer structure of Trex1 in the recombinant protein and to determine the native structure for TREX2, these proteins were subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Fig.4). In separate experiments the recombinant Trex1 or TREX2 proteins were mixed with protein standards and subjected to gel filtration using a Superdex-200 column. The Trex1 protein elutes from the column coincident with the BSA standard, indicating an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa (Fig. 4 A). The calculated molecular mass of the recombinant Trex1 protein is 33,675 Da. These data support a dimer structure for the recombinant Trex1 protein and provide evidence that the structure of the recombinant Trex1 conforms to that of the native protein. The TREX2 protein demonstrates gel filtration properties indicating an apparent molecular mass of 52 kDa (Fig. 4 B). Because the calculated molecular mass of TREX2 is 25,922 Da, a dimer structure is predicted. The possible formation of heterodimers between these proteins has not been tested. Our initial experiments to measure the 3′→5′ exonuclease activities of the recombinant Trex1 and TREX2 proteins indicated similar, but not identical, excision properties. A steady-state kinetic analysis was performed to more precisely quantify the catalytic constants governing excision of 3′ nucleotides by these enzymes (TableII). Excision by the recombinant Trex1 and TREX2 proteins was measured using varied concentrations of a single-stranded 21-mer to determine the catalytic rate constantkcat and the apparent dissociation constantKm without consideration for DNA structure. Excision by Trex1 and TREX2 was also measured using varied concentrations of a double-stranded DNA substrate prepared by hybridizing the 21-mer to a 37-mer generating a partial duplex with a 16 nucleotide 5′ overhang. The kcat values determined for Trex1 and TREX2 from these data reveal the high turnover numbers for these enzymes during excision of 3′ nucleotides (Table II). Thesekcat values vary by less than 2-fold when meas"
https://openalex.org/W2107920932,"Sorting nexins (SNX) comprise a family of proteins with homology to several yeast proteins, including Vps5p and Mvp1p, that are required for the sorting of proteins to the yeast vacuole. Human SNX1, -2, and -4 have been proposed to play a role in receptor trafficking and have been shown to bind to several receptor tyrosine kinases, including receptors for epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin as well as the long form of the leptin receptor, a glycoprotein 130-associated receptor. We now describe a novel member of this family, SNX6, which interacts with members of the transforming growth factor-β family of receptor serine-threonine kinases. These receptors belong to two classes: type II receptors that bind ligand, and type I receptors that are subsequently recruited to transduce the signal. Of the type II receptors, SNX6 was found to interact strongly with ActRIIB and more moderately with wild type and kinase-defective mutants of TβRII. Of the type I receptors, SNX6 was found to interact only with inactivated TβRI. SNXs 1–4 also interacted with the transforming growth factor-β receptor family, showing different receptor preferences. Conversely, SNX6 behaved similarly to the other SNX proteins in its interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases. Strong heteromeric interactions were also seen among SNX1, -2, -4, and -6, suggesting the formation in vivo of oligomeric complexes. These findings are the first evidence for the association of the SNX family of molecules with receptor serine-threonine kinases.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). Although there are no yeast TGF-βs, homologs have been identified in primitive metazoans, including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila(2Padgett R.W. St. Johnston R.D. Gelbart W.M.

With the exception of only glial-derived neurotrophic factor, these ligands signal through heterotetrameric pairs of serine-threonine kinase receptors. Ligand first interacts with a type II receptor, which, following ligand binding, recruits a type I receptor (5Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). The type II receptors are constitutively active kinases, catalyzing phosphorylation both of themselves in an autocatalytic reaction and of the recruited type I receptor (6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). Once bound to ligand and phosphorylated by the type II receptor, the type I receptor then transduces the signal to the intracellular signaling intermediates, including the recently described family of Smad proteins (7Wrana J.L.

In general, one or two closely related type I and one or two closely related type II receptors are utilized by each class of ligand. For example, TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 bind to the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII), with subsequent recruitment of the type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI/ALK5 (activin-like kinase 5)) (6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). Similarly, activin binds to either ActRII or ActRIIB, with activin type IB receptor (ALK4) or possibly ActRI (ALK2) then joining the complex (14ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzen P. Laiho M.

BMPs typically bind to their type II receptor (BMPRII) and then recruit either BMPRIA (ALK3) or BMPRIB (ALK6) (14ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzen P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H.

Despite extensive work on the characterization of the ligand binding affinities of the various receptors and determination of downstream signaling following ligand binding, relatively little is known about the trafficking of TGF-β receptors within the cell. Experiments in mink lung epithelial cells have shown that endogenous TβRI and TβRII move from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface along independent, non-intersecting pathways, so that no heteromeric complex formation occurs prior to the expression of these receptors on the cell surface (22Wells R.G.

The pathways available to individual receptors following internalization have not yet been characterized. The sorting nexins are a family of cytoplasmic and membrane-associated proteins that are hypothesized to function in the intracellular trafficking of plasma membrane receptors. The first sorting nexin, SNX1, was cloned in a yeast two-hybrid assay as an interactor with the cytoplasmic domain of the EGF receptor (28Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). SNX1 was subsequently shown to be homologous to Vps5p, a yeast protein essential for the correct targeting of carboxypeptidase Y and other soluble hydrolases from the trans-Golgi network through an endosomal/prevacuolar compartment to the yeast vacuole (29Ekena K. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1671-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Horazdovsky B.F. Davies B.A. Seaman M.N. McLaughlin S.A. Yoon S. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1529-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Given this function for the yeast SNX1 homolog, SNX1 itself was proposed to target the EGF receptor for lysosomal degradation through an endocytic pathway. Four additional sorting nexins have subsequently been cloned (31Haft C.R. de la Luz S.M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). SNX2, SNX3, and SNX4 were identified in data base searches through homology with SNX1. Studies with these four proteins have shown that SNX1, SNX2, and SNX4 bind to multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including receptors for EGF, PDGF, and insulin, and to the long form of the leptin receptor (31Haft C.R. de la Luz S.M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). SNX1 additionally binds to the transferrin receptor. Furthermore, SNX1, SNX2, and SNX4 oligomerize with each other (31Haft C.R. de la Luz S.M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). SNX3 is distinguished from the other SNXs in that it does not associate with any of the receptors studied or with any of the other SNXs (31Haft C.R. de la Luz S.M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The most recently reported sorting nexin, SNX5, was cloned using the yeast two-hybrid system as an interactor with the Fanconi anemia complementation group A protein (4Otsuki T. Kajigaya S. Ozawa K. Liu J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the cloning of a novel sorting nexin, SNX6. This molecule was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify binding partners of Smad1, but studies in mammalian cells have shown that the interaction with this Smad protein is very weak and that, instead, SNX6 shows strong interactions with several members of the TGF-β family of receptor serine-threonine kinases, as well as with receptor tyrosine kinases shown previously to interact with other SNX proteins. We also show that SNX6 can hetero-oligomerize and colocalize intracellularly with SNX1, SNX2, and SNX4 and that these other SNXs also associate with members of the TGF-β receptor family. These studies are the first to document the interaction of sorting nexins with receptor serine-threonine kinases, thus broadening the range of receptor interactions with the SNX family. COS-1, COS-7, and HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) (Life Technologies, Inc). SNX6 was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length Smad1 as bait and a human fetal brain cDNA library. Full-length human SNX6 was subsequently cloned from a heart cDNA library using standard techniques. The full-length human clone was sequenced in both directions with standard techniques. Sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment program. Human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a full-length SNX6 probe. The probe was 32P-labeled using a RadPrime DNA Synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.) random-primed DNA labeling kit. The blots were hybridized overnight at 65 °C and then washed 3 times for 30 min each at 65 °C. Washed blots were autoradiographed for several days at −80 °C. 5′-Tagged full-length and deletion constructs of SNX6 were all prepared using a PCR-based strategy. PCR primers for the gene sequences includedBamHI and ClaI restriction sites. PCR products were gel-purified, restriction-digested, and then ligated into theBamHI/ClaI sites in the vectors pEBB-FLAG and pEBB-HA. Each construct was fully sequenced. For the coimmunoprecipitation experiments COS-1 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 2 × 106 cells 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected for 4 h in serum-free medium using 45 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and replenished with fresh medium. After 24 h the medium was replaced with DMEM plus 0.2% FBS, and 48 h after transfection the cells were lysed by the addition of 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) plus phosphatase and protease inhibitors. The cells were allowed to incubate in the lysis buffer for 20 min on ice and were then scraped into microcentrifuge tubes. After high speed centrifugation for 15 min, an aliquot of the lysate was removed for Western blotting, and the remainder was immunoprecipitated for 2 h with 0.4–1 μg of an epitope-specific antibody and 35 μl of protein G-Sepharose (80% suspension) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lysates and immunoprecipitates were then separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) for blotting. Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated primary or secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Antibodies used were anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal 9E10 (hybridoma supernatant), anti-c-Myc rabbit polyclonal A-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA mouse monoclonal 12CA5 (hybridoma supernatant), anti-HA rabbit polyclonal Y-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA mouse monoclonal (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal M2 (Sigma), anti-TβRII rabbit polyclonal C16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TβRII goat polyclonal (R & D Systems), and anti-SNX2 rabbit polyclonal. The procedure for the immunoprecipitation of endogenous complexes from HepG2 cells varied only in that the immunoprecipitation and the primary antibody staining were performed overnight. COS-1 cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells onto 22-mm glass coverslips 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected for 4 h in serum-free medium using 8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and replenished with fresh medium. After 24 h the serum was replaced with DMEM plus 0.2% FBS. 48 h after transfection the cells were fixed in cold 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, permeabilized in cold absolute methanol for 2 min, and then incubated 5 min in 50 mmglycine to quench paraformaldehyde autofluorescence. The transfected constructs were then detected by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with M2 mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody and Y-11 rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody. After washing in PBS (3 times for 5 min each), the coverslips were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies. The coverslips were then mounted in medium containing 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). The cells were examined using a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope. HepG2 cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. For the 3TP-Lux assays the cells were transfected with the 3TP-Lux reporter, pSV-β-gal to normalize transfection efficiency, the sorting nexin, and pCDNA3 to normalize the amount of transfected DNA. For the FAST1/ARE assays the cells were transfected with FAST1, the 3A-Luc reporter, pSV-β-gal, the sorting nexin, and pCDNA3. Cells were transfected for 8 h in serum-free medium using 8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and replenished with fresh medium. After 24 h the serum was replaced with DMEM plus 0.2% FBS, and the cells were treated with either 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 or 50 ng/ml Activin A for 24 h. The cells were then lysed, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined. All assays were performed in triplicate. The β-galactosidase values were used to correct the luciferase values for transfection efficiency. Sorting nexin 6 was first cloned from a yeast two-hybrid screen to detect proteins interacting with Smad1, a signaling intermediate in the BMP pathway (32Kim R.H. Wang D. Tsang M. Martin J. Huff C. de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Meng X. Lechleider R.J. Wang T. Roberts A.B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1605-1616PubMed Google Scholar). However, attempts to confirm this interaction in a mammalian system demonstrated that SNX6 associated only weakly with Smad1. Subsequent data base searches noted the precise sequence for sorting nexin 6 and identified this clone as a member of the sorting nexin family. The amino acid sequence alignment for sorting nexins 1–6 is presented in Fig. 1 A, and a schematic sequence alignment of these same sorting nexins is depicted in Fig. 1 B. The PX domains, which are aligned, are indicated by the white boxes, and the predicted coiled coil regions are represented by the smaller black boxes. Each protein contains only one PX domain but a variable number of coiled coils. SNX3, unlike the others, has no coiled coil regions, which may contribute to its general lack of association with other proteins. SNX5 shows the greatest similarity to SNX6 (66% identity at the amino acid level), and these two proteins structurally resemble each other with short amino-terminal regions and a relatively long spacer region between the PX domain and the first coiled coil. Northern blot analysis of SNX6 using a human multiple tissue blot and full-length SNX6 as probe disclosed widespread expression of the gene (Fig. 1 C). Expression was highest in heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta, with little expression noted for lung or liver. Two transcripts were detected, one of 3.0 kilobase pairs and one of 2.2 kilobase pairs. The intensity for the smaller transcript was always greater than that for the larger transcript. Since SNX6 interacted only weakly with Smad family members (data not shown) and since other SNX family members had been shown to interact with cell surface receptors, we investigated whether SNX6 might interact directly with receptors of the TGF-β family. Initially, type I receptors (ALK1–ALK6) and the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII) were assessed for their ability to bind SNX6. The kinase-deficient (KD) mutants of these receptors were utilized in order to maximize the likelihood of observing what might otherwise be a transient association. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged SNX6 followed by blotting for the HA-tagged receptors demonstrated strong binding of SNX6 to the KD TβRII (Fig. 2 A, lane 9) and to KD ALK5 (TβRI) (lane 7), with much weaker associations evident with KD ALK1 (lane 2) and KD ALK6 (lane 8). A panel of type II receptors was also tested for interaction with SNX6 (Fig. 2 B). Wild type (WT) type II receptors were chosen for this panel, with KD TβRII also included for comparison with the previous experiments. SNX6 associated more strongly with ActRIIB than with KD TβRII and showed only a weak association with WT TβRII. It did not interact with ActRII or BMPRII. Attempts were then undertaken to map the interacting regions of the proteins. Deletion mutants of SNX6 were designed to isolate the effects of particular motifs of the protein, especially the PX or the coiled coil domains (Fig. 2 C). SNX6 deletion mutants were tested with KD TβRI in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and in these studies the PX domain alone (1) bound the receptor as strongly as the full-length protein, whereas the coiled coil domain showed only a weak association with the receptor (Fig. 2 D). Other sorting nexins have been shown previously to interact with receptor tyrosine kinases. To investigate associations of SNX6 with receptor tyrosine kinases, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with various receptors and HA-tagged SNX6. Each receptor was then immunoprecipitated, and Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates was performed for the HA-tagged SNX6. Sorting nexin 6 associated with each receptor examined, the EGF receptor, the insulin receptor, and the PDGF receptor, and with the long form of the leptin receptor (Fig.3). Given the strong associations of SNX6 with various receptors within the TGF-β family, we examined the associations between these receptors and the other sorting nexins. The interactions of SNX1–SNX4 were determined for the panel of KD type I receptors, with the results tabulated in TableI. SNX3 showed no interaction with any of the KD receptors, and SNX1 showed a weak interaction with only KD ALK4. SNX2 and SNX4 demonstrated more robust associations, with SNX2 interacting with KD ALK4, KD ALK6, and KD TβRII and with SNX4 interacting with KD TβRII and more weakly with KD ALK6. Since SNX6 bound strongly to KD ALK5, we then tested the interaction of this receptor with the other SNXs. KD ALK5 bound to varying degrees to all SNXs except SNX3, with SNX6 showing the strongest interaction, and SNX1, SNX2, and SNX4 showing more modest levels of association (Fig.4 A). A similar experiment was then performed to assess the binding of the various SNXs with ActRIIB, which had been shown to interact most strongly with SNX6 (Fig.4 B). Interestingly, SNX1, -2, and -6 also interacted strongly with this type II receptor. As expected, SNX3 did not interact but surprisingly neither did SNX4. Finally, in order to demonstrate the physiologic relevance of these interactions, we sought an association of an endogenous SNX with an endogenous receptor serine-threonine kinase. HepG2 cells were used since they have both abundant SNX2 and detectable levels of TβRII. Immunoprecipitation for the receptor using an antibody against the extracellular domain coimmunoprecipitated a portion of the endogenous SNX2 (Fig. 4 C). Comparable experiments using an antibody directed against the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor failed to show a similar interaction (data not shown), suggesting that the antibody disrupts the association of the sorting nexin with the cytoplasmic region of the receptor.Table IAssociation of SNX with kinase-deficient type I and type II receptorsReceptorALK1 KDALK2 KDALK3 KDALK4 KDALK5 KDALK6 KDTβRII KDSNX1−−−Weak−−−SNX2−−−ModerateModerate−StrongSNX3−−−−−−−SNX4−−−−WeakWeakStrongSNX6Weak−−−StrongModerateStrong Open table in a new tab As SNX proteins have been shown to complex with each other, we assessed the ability of SNX6 to form homo-and hetero-oligomeric complexes by cotransfecting epitope-tagged SNX expression vectors into COS-1 cells, followed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of cell lysates. Homomeric interactions were tested by cotransfecting HA- and FLAG-tagged SNX6 into COS-1 cells. Following immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, Western blotting with anti-HA antibody demonstrated a strong homomeric association (Fig.5 A) that was not affected by treatment with TGF-β1 (data not shown). Similar studies were carried out to determine whether heteromeric interactions could be detected between SNX6 and the other sorting nexins. Interaction studies using HA-SNX6 and Myc-tagged SNX1-SNX4 showed strong associations of SNX6 with SNX1, SNX2, and SNX4 but no association with SNX3 (Fig.5 B). To map the regions of the protein that mediate the association between SNX6 and the other sorting nexins, deletion constructs of SNX6 were tested for their ability to interact with either SNX1 or SNX4. In contrast to the selective interaction of the PX domain with TβRII, these experiments showed that all regions of the molecule retained considerable ability to interact (Fig. 5 C and data not shown). Only SNX6-(1–72), the extreme amino terminus lacking both the PX and coiled coil domains, did not associate. The relative uniformity of expression of the various deletion constructs suggests that the degree of association with each region was similar and that both the PX domain and the coiled coil regions may contribute to the hetero-oligomerization. Indirect immunofluorescence was utilized to assess the intracellular localization of SNX6 and to seek further evidence for the association of SNX6 with other sorting nexins. Both SNX6 (Fig.6, A, E, I, and M) and sorting nexins 1–4 (Fig. 6, B, F, J, and N) localized specifically to the cell cytoplasm in a diffuse pattern. This cytoplasmic localization for SNX6 was not altered by cotransfection of a constitutively active TβRI to stimulate TGF-β signaling pathways or a constitutively active BMPRIA to stimulate BMP signaling (data not shown). Cotransfection of SNX6 and sorting nexins 1, 2, and 4 showed nearly complete overlap of the two staining patterns, as indicated by the yellow color in the images (Fig. 6, D, H, and P). Surprisingly, cotransfection of SNX3 with SNX6 also showed considerable, although not complete, colocalization (Fig. 6 L). For this pair of proteins, the overlap is strongest at the periphery of the cell, in contrast to the uniform overlap seen with the other SNXs. One question not yet answered by the previous experiments was whether alteration of the levels of SNX6 within a cell might perturb TGF-β signal transduction pathways. To explore this issue, functional assays using TGF-β-responsive reporter constructs linked to luciferase expression were performed in HepG2 cells. These assays measure the ability of a ligand to induce gene expression, and they thereby assess the functional capacity of the entire signaling pathway. Any disturbance along the pathway, including a possible shift in cell surface expression of the TGF-β or activin receptors, might be expected to change the flux through the pathway and quantifiably modify the read-out. The FAST1/ARE assay uses the 3A-Luc reporter, a construct generated by the tandem repeat of an activin response element identified in the promoter for the Mix2gene. The assay, which is sensitive to both TGF-β and activin, measures a direct, Smad2-specific response. Assays using this reporter with stimulation by TGF-β demonstrated a 5-fold reduction in luciferase activity with increasing amounts of SNX6 (Fig.7 A), and similar assays with stimulation by activin showed an 8-fold decrease (Fig. 7 B). For both ligands the reduction in luciferase values occurred in a stepwise, dose-dependent fashion. 3TP-Lux, a segment of the PAI-1 promoter downstream of three 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements, is also sensitive to both TGF-β and activin. In assays using this reporter, SNX6 reduced the stimulation by TGF-β about 50% (Fig. 7 C). Interestingly, the basal, unstimulated luciferase readings for both reporters diminished at an even greater rate with increasing SNX6, with the FAST1/ARE system showing a 12-fold reduction and the 3TP-Lux system a 6-fold decrease. As a control, similar assays were performed using increasing amounts of SNX3, the one sorting nexin that bound none of the tested receptor serine-threonine kinases. In contrast to SNX6, SNX3 had no effect on reporter activity (data not shown), suggesting that the reduction in the basal values is not nonspecific but likely due to interference with autocrine stimulation of the reporters by TGF-β. In this paper we show for the first time associations between members of the sorting nexin family and receptor serine-threonine kinases. Each SNX showed a different pattern of interaction with these receptors of the TGF-β family. Concerning the type I receptors, SNX6 alone bound strongly to ALK5. Likewise, only SNX2 interacted appreciably with ALK4. Differences in association patterns for SNX binding were again evident in their interactions with the type II receptors. TβRII associated with SNX2, SNX4, and SNX6 but not with SNX1 or SNX3, whereas ActRIIB interacted strongly with SNX1, SNX2, and SNX6 but not with SNX3 or SNX4. In contrast to the distinct associations of SNXs with receptor serine-threonine kinases, the pattern of SNX6 binding to the receptor tyrosine kinases was similar to that of the other sorting nexins. All SNXs (except SNX3) tested to date have interacted at least to a degree with the tested receptor tyrosine kinases (28Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 31Haft C.R. de la Luz S.M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and SNX6 reproduced this pattern, binding the EGF receptor, the PDGF receptor, the insulin receptor, and the long form of the leptin receptor. Studies of the association of endogenous SNX2 with TβRII confirmed that the above findings have physiologic relevance. We feel that the somewhat low stoichiometry of the interaction results from the confluence of several features of sorting nexin biology. First, the sorting nexins are capable of binding to a range of different receptors, but probably only one or two simultaneously. In a cell only a minority of the sorting nexin molecules is likely interacting with a given receptor. Similarly, most cells express multiple different sorting nexins, so that at any given time one type of receptor may be interacting with multiple sorting nexins. Finally, sorting nexins may have other roles in the cell so that only a small proportion is bound to receptors in the normal physiologic state. Although the function of the sorting nexins is not yet clear, the intracellular localization of these molecules to vesicles and their strong interactions with receptors suggest that, as a part of their roles within the cell, the different sorting nexins are involved in the targeting of receptors to intracellular trafficking pathways. A characteristic structural feature of the sorting nexins is the Phox homology (PX) domain, a roughly 100-amino acid motif of uncertain function found in components of the NADPH oxidase system, the sorting nexins and their orthologs, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (33Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This domain is typically found in the middle of the molecule or nearer the amino terminus. All of the sorting nexins except for SNX3, which consists almost entirely of a PX domain with only minimal amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions, also have at least one coiled coil domain near their carboxyl terminus. Heteromeric interactions of SNX6 with other sorting nexins appear to be mediated roughly to an equal degree through the PX domain or the coiled coil regions of SNX6. The receptors can also associate with either domain of SNX6, although the interaction seems to be stronger with the PX domain. The involvement of these domains in interactions between SNX6 and another SNX or between SNX6 and a receptor suggests a model in which a receptor interacts with the PX domain of SNX6, whereas another sorting nexin associates through the coiled coil domain, forming a linear trimeric complex. More probably, additional SNX molecules interact through both their PX and coiled coil domains, allowing larger complex formation, likely including multiple receptor molecules. The function of the sorting nexins is at this time still unknown. Mutation of the yeast homologs results in protein missorting, suggesting that they are involved in intracellular trafficking (29Ekena K. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1671-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,30Horazdovsky B.F. Davies B.A. Seaman M.N. McLaughlin S.A. Yoon S. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1529-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells overexpression of SNX1 was noted to accelerate EGF receptor degradation, implying a role for this protein in endosomal transport. Our reporter assays add further evidence that these molecules play a role in receptor trafficking pathways. The linear decrease in signal with increasing SNX6 clearly indicates that the sorting nexin is interfering with TGF-β signaling. Although these assays provide no direct measure for any single component of this signaling pathway, when examined in the context of the previous coimmunoprecipitation data these results suggest that the increasing amounts of SNX6 within a cell alter plasma membrane receptors. The sorting nexin may be binding to and sequestering receptor, fostering increased receptor degradation, or directly inhibiting receptor function. Despite these findings, definitive evidence for a specific function remains elusive. Recently, the sorting nexins have been identified as part of a molecular complex termed the retromer complex, which may facilitate retrograde transport from endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network. A core retromer complex, consisting of Vps35p, Vps29p, and Vps26p, was first identified in yeast and shown to function in the retrieval of Vps10p (the carboxypeptidase Y receptor) from endosomes to the Golgi (34Seaman M.N. Marcusson E.G. Cereghino J.L. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Subsequent work demonstrated that Vps5p, the SNX1 homolog, and Vps17p, another PX domain containing protein, also form part of this complex. In particular, these experiments suggested that a core complex of Vps35p, Vps29p, and Vps26p provides the receptor specificity, after which Vps5p and Vps17p assemble onto the membrane to promote vesicle formation (35Seaman M.N. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The human orthologs of Vps35p, Vps29p, and Vps26p have been cloned and investigated recently (36Haft C.R. Sierra M.L. Bafford R. Lesniak M.A. Barr V.A. Taylor S.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4105-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These binding experiments demonstrate multiple interactions among these proteins, again suggesting that Vps35p forms the core of a molecular complex. But the precise mechanism by which the cargo of a given transport vesicle is chosen still remains undetermined. Given the differing specificities the sorting nexins display for the receptor serine-threonine kinases, the probability seems high that these molecules, rather than the core retromer complex, either serve to select the proteins to be conveyed within particular transport vesicles or associate with and provide a marker for those proteins that actually do regulate this specificity. In conclusion, we have cloned a novel sorting nexin, SNX6, that interacts strongly with specific members of the receptor serine-threonine kinase and receptor tyrosine kinase families and that colocalizes and associates with other sorting nexins. These findings demonstrate for the first time the interaction of sorting nexins with a family of receptor serine-threonine kinases, both enlarging the scope of receptors that interact with this class of proteins and showing a higher degree of specificity than that noted for the receptor tyrosine kinases. The results of these experiments further suggest that the sorting nexins function in a multimeric complex to enable the specific selection and transport of molecules within the intracellular vesicular transport pathways. Whether the levels of this family of proteins are regulated to modulate physiological responses or to play a role in disease pathogenesis remains to be determined. We thank Drs.

We show that Fe65, through its WW domain, binds in vitro andin vivo the active form of Abl. Furthermore, in cells expressing the active form of Abl, APP is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Phosphopeptide analysis and site-directed mutagenesis support the hypothesis that Tyr682 of APP695 is the target of this phosphorylation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that active Abl and tyrosine-phosphorylated APP also form a stable complex, which could result from the interaction of the pYENP motif of the APP cytodomain with the SH2 domain of Abl.

The functions of APP are still poorly understood,despite a significant amount of information concerning its involvement in a complex protein-protein interaction network. APP is a type I membrane protein with a small cytosolic domain that has been shown to interact with several soluble proteins.

They have the characteristics of adaptor proteins, and thus they could connect APP to different intracellular molecular pathways. In addition to the PTB domain, X11 has two PDZ (PSD-95/DlgA/ZO-1) domains and forms oligomeric complexes with two other proteins, Munc-18 and CASK (9Borg J.P. Straight S.W.

Genetic studies have demonstrated that insects bearing the mutation of the gene homologous to the mammalian c-abl tyrosine kinase gene survive past morphogenesis with some defects in eye structure, but when this mutation is associated with heterozygous or homozygous mutations of the disabled gene, defects in the formation of central nervous system are observed. Insects that are homozygous for mutations in both Abl and disabled genes show an almost complete loss of proper axonal connections (14Gertler F.B. Bennett R.L. Clark M.J. Hoffmann F.M.

In fact, mice lacking mDab1 show severe abnormalities in the development of the central nervous system, including defects in migration of neurons (19Howell B.W Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), whereas the mutation of Mena causes defects in neurulation and commissure formation (20Lanier L.M. Gates M.A. Witke W.

The c-abl proto-oncogene is the cellular counterpart of the viral oncogene of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, and its gene is involved in the Philadelphia chromosome translocation t (9;22) that generates the BCR-Abl fusion protein in human leukemia (for review see Ref. 21Cortes J.E. Talpaz M. Kantarjian H. Am. J. Med. 1996; 100: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Abl is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase similar to c-Src. At the N-terminal half, Abl contains an SH3 and an SH2 domain, and in the middle it contains a kinase domain. In contrast to Src and other kinases, its C terminus is long and contains nuclear localization, nuclear export signals, and domains that are able to interact with DNA and F-actin (for recent reviews, see Refs. 22Van Etten R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar and 23Shaul Y. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The intracellular distribution of Abl is very peculiar; among the various isoforms of Abl, one (type IV) is membrane-associated and another is soluble (type I). The latter can be found in either the cytosol or the nucleus. The cytosolic Abl interacts with the actin cytoskeleton (24Van Etten R.A. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), whereas in the nucleus it can bind DNA and other proteins (25Miao Y-J. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8905-8911Google Scholar). Despite the large amount of experimental data on Abl, its functions are still not fully understood. In particular the molecular mechanisms connecting Drosophila Abl to disabled andenabled and mammalian Abl to mDab1 and Mena are not known. However, the opposite effects of the mutations of theenabled and disabled genes inDrosophila suggest that the products of these genes may be involved in the same molecular pathway. This conjecture is in agreement with the observations that both mDab1 and Mena participate in the protein-protein interaction network centered at the cytodomain of APP and supports the hypothesis that c-Abl also could be involved in the APP-centered molecular machinery. In this report we demonstrate that APP is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells expressing a constitutively active form of Abl. Active Abl is tightly connected to the oligomeric complexes formed by APP, because Abl binds to the WW domain of Fe65 and is co-immunoprecipitated with APP. The Fe65 and APP695expression constructs have been described (5Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol.

To generate the APPY653F, Y682F, and Y687A constructs, missense mutations in the APP695 cDNA were introduced by the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions, with the following six primer pairs (Ceinge): 5′-GGTGATGCTGAAGAAGAAACAGTTCACATCCATTCATCATGGTGTGG-3′; 5′-CCACACCATGATGAATGGATGTGAACTGTTTCTTCTTCAGCATCACC-3′; 5′-CGGCTACGAAAATCCAACCGCCAAGTTCTTTGAGCAGATGC-3′; 5′-GCATCTGCTCAAAGAACTTGGCGGTTGGATTTTCGTAGCCG-3′; 5′-CCAAGATGCAGCAGAACGGCTTCGAAAATCCAACCTACAAGTTCTTTG-3′; 5′-CAAAGAACTTGTAGGTTGGATTTTCGAAGCCGTTCTGCTGCATCTTGG-3′. The recombinant constructs were sequenced by the dideoxy terminator method with the Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to confirm the inserted mutations. All plasmids were propagated following standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor University Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and purified on Qiagen Maxi-columns (Qiagen). COS7 african green monkey kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimal medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For transfection, 3 × 106 cells were electroporated at 250 microfarad and 220 V with 5 μg each of the indicated recombinant constructs. When multiple DNAs were co-transfected, the total amount of DNA was maintained constant by the addition of pRc-CMV empty vector DNA (Invitrogen). 36 h after transfection, cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and gently lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay according to manufacturer's instructions. The GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of Abl or the WW, PTB1, and PTB2 domains of Fe65 were obtained by isopropyl-thiogalactoside induction of Escherichia coli cells harboring the corresponding constructs and purified from the bacterial lysates with glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For the pull-down experiments, purified fusion proteins were used to saturate glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 μl) and challenged to transfected COS7 cell extracts (500 μg/sample). Unbound proteins were removed by washing three times the beads with lysis buffer, while retained proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and analyzed by Western blot with the indicated antibodies. Loading of the GST proteins was checked by staining the filters with Ponceau S solution (Sigma).

Chem. 1997; 272: 1389-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), washed immune complexes, obtained with anti-Abl sc-23 antibody (Santa Cruz) from Abl-PP-transfected COS7 cell extracts (100 μg), were equilibrated in assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm manganese chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitrol) and washed. The kinase reaction was carried out at room temperature for 15 min by incubating the beads with 20 μl of assay buffer in the presence of 1 μg of synthetic 38-mer APP peptide (Primm) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequence of the synthetic 38-mer peptide is the following: K6DAAVTPEERHLSKMQQNGYENPTYKFFEQMQN. Control reactions were carried out in the absence of any protein source and in the presence of nonspecific immune complex. The reaction products were fractionated onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie R-250 (Bio-Rad), and exposed to autoradiographic films. For phosphopeptide analysis (30Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 31Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The labeled peptide band, visualized by autoradiography, was excised and subjected to hydrolysis in the presence of 6 n HCl for 90 min at 110 °C. Lyophilized phospho-amino acids were resuspended in water and resolved by thin layer chromatography on cellulose-coated glass plates (Sigma) in propionic acid, 1 m ammonium hydroxide, 2-propanol solvent (45/17.5/17.5, v/v/v). Detection of the labeled sample was by autoradiography. Phospho-amino acid standardsl-phosphoserine, l-phosphothreonine, andl-phosphotyrosine (Sigma) were run on adjacent lanes and detected by ninhydrin spraying. It was recently hypothesized that Abl could interact with APP through the adaptor proteins, which are known to bind to the APP cytodomain (32Bothwell M. Giniger E. Cell. 2000; 102: 271-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We explored the possibility that Fe65, one of the multimodular proteins that forms complexes with APP, could be one of the adaptors that tethers Abl to the cytodomain of APP. To address this point we performed pull-down experiments in which GST-Fe65 fusion proteins were used as baits to entrap Abl from extracts of COS7 cells transfected with plasmid vectors driving the expression of type IV mouse c-Abl or of Abl-PP, in which the mutation of two prolines of c-Abl (Pro242 and Pro249), located between the SH2 domain and the TK domain, results in a constitutive TK activity (33Barilà D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, both PTB domains of Fe65 do not interact with Abl-PP. On the contrary, Abl-PP is affinity-purified by the GST-Fe65 fusion protein containing the WW domain. A similar result was observed by using the extracts from cells transfected with c-Abl, which similarly interacts only with the GST-Fe65-WW protein. This interaction between Fe65 and Abl, observed in vitro, was analyzed in extracts from COS7 cells transfected with c-Abl or Abl-PP and immunoprecipitated with the Fe65 antibody. As shown in Fig.1 B, this experiment demonstrated that the constitutively active Abl-PP mutant is present in the proteins immunoprecipitated by Fe65 antibody (see lane 2), whereas c-Abl is not (seelane 9). Looking at the amino acid sequence of Abl, there is at least one motif that can be recognized by the WW of Fe65 (PPPPPA) located between amino acids 899 and 904 (13Ermekova K-S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 34Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB. J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The Fe65-Abl-PP interaction supports the hypothesis that Fe65 functions as a docking site to bring Abl close to phosphorylation targets. To evaluate whether Fe65 itself is a target of Abl TK, the same blot of Fig. 1 Bwas challenged with an anti-pTyr antibody. This experiment demonstrated that Fe65 is not recognized by this antibody (see Fig. 1 B,lane 4), and therefore its tyrosine phosphorylation is unlikely. It was documented that APP is phosphorylated on Ser and Thrin vitro and in vivo (35Suzuki T. Oishi M. Marshak D.M. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 36Suzuki T. Ando K. Isohara T. Oishi M. Lim G.S. Satoh Y. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Gandy S.E. Kirino Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4646-4649Google Scholar). However, APP was never observed to be Tyr-phosphorylated. We analyzed the possibility that Tyr residues present in the cytodomain of APP are substrates of Abl TK activity. To this aim, COS7 cells were transfected with an APP695 expression vector and/or with the vector driving the expression of Abl-PP. Fig. 2 Ashows that proteins immunoprecipitated using the APP antibody contained a band of the same size as that of APP and clearly stained with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody only in cells that express the constitutively active mutant form of Abl (see lane 2). Conversely, APP is present in the proteins immunoprecipitated with the anti-pTyr antibody, again only in cells expressing the active form of Abl (see Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 and 7). To evaluate whether the band immunoprecipitated by the APP antibody and stained by the anti-pTyr antibody is the consequence of a Tyr phosphorylation of the APP cytosolic domain, a peptide was synthesized on the basis of the C-terminal sequence of APP, common to all the APP isoforms. This peptide was incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP with an Abl-immunoprecipitated extract of COS7 cells expressing Abl-PP. Fig. 2 B shows the autoradiography of the SDS-PAGE gel and the peptide results to be32P-labeled only when incubated with the proteins immunoprecipitated with the Abl antibody and not with the proteins immunoprecipitated with unrelated antibodies. The labeled band was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride filter, and the peptide was hydrolyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting amino acids were separated by thin layer chromatography, and32P-labeled amino acids were detected by autoradiography. Fig. 2 C shows that the only 32P-labeled residue found in the hydrolyzed peptide was phosphotyrosine. There are three tyrosines located in the cytodomain of APP (residues 653, 682, and 687 of APP695). To analyze their involvement in the above described phenomena, we generated three mutant APP695 expression vectors in which Tyr653 or Tyr682 has been changed into phenylalanine or Tyr687 has been changed into alanine. These vectors were transfected in COS7 cells with the Abl-PP-expressing vector. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the APP-Y653F and APP-Y687A are recognized by the anti-pTyr antibody, whereas the APP-Y682F is not; this suggests the hypothesis that Tyr682 is the actual target of the phosphorylation of the citodomain of APP. This result is in agreement with the data concerning the substrate preference of protein tyrosine kinases, indicating that c-Abl preferentially phosphorylates proteins at the level of the YXXP motif (37Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 273: 536-539Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar), where X are hydrophilic residues, which fits with the YENP sequence we found to be phosphorylated in APP. The Western blot experiment of Fig. 2 A (see lane 2), in addition to the APP bands also shows a slower migrating band recognized by the anti-pTyr antibody and co-immunoprecipitated by the APP antibody. This band is present only in the samples from COS7 cells co-transfected with Abl-PP, and its size is compatible with that of Abl itself. This possibility was analyzed in the experiments reported in Fig. 3; panel A shows the Western blot analysis with Abl antibody of proteins immunoprecipitated by APP antibody that demonstrated the presence of Abl in the immunoprecipitates. The co-immunoprecipitation of Abl with APP has been observed also in cells not transfected with APP (see Fig.3 A, lane 3), thus suggesting that the transfected, active Abl could also be co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous APP751, present in significant amounts in COS7 cells. The co-immunoprecipitation of APP and Abl was confirmed in the experiment reported in Fig. 3 B, in which protein extracts from COS7 cells were immunoprecipitated with Abl antibody and blotted with APP. Also in this case APP is present in the extract immunoprecipitated by the Abl antibody. It was demonstrated that the various known protein tyrosine kinases phosphorylate Tyr-containing sites that, upon phosphorylation, are recognized by their own or closely related SH2 domains (38Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the phosphorylation of the APP cytodomain at the level of the YENP motif generates a new motif, pYXXP, that could interact with Abl SH2 domain. To examine this point, COS7 cells were transfected with APP695 or with APP695 and Abl-PP expression vectors. Total extracts from these cells were analyzed in pull-down experiments using a GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of Abl. As shown in Fig. 3 C, GST-Abl-SH2 protein is able to bind to APP only in cells overexpressing active Abl, thus supporting the hypothesis that tyrosine-phosphorylated APP can form complexes with Abl through the Abl SH2 domain. In any case, it is worth noting that the APP Y682F mutant, which is not tyrosine-phosphorylated, still co-immunoprecipitates with Abl, thus suggesting that in addition to an APP-Abl interaction mediated by the SH2 domain, other complexes could contain both APP and Abl. We addressed the question of the possible involvement of Abl in the protein-protein interaction network centered at the cytosolic domain of APP and found that APP is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells expressing a constitutively active Abl. In addition we showed that this protein forms complexes with Fe65 and with APP itself. Our results suggest that Fe65 could bind at the same time APP, through its PTB2 domain, and Abl, through its WW domain, thus allowing the formation of a heterotrimeric complex. As a consequence of this interaction, active Abl is docked close to the APP cytodomain, and this could favor the phosphorylation of its Tyr682 (see a hypothetical model in Fig. 4). The observed co-immunoprecipitation of Tyr-phosphorylated APP and Abl could be the consequence of APP-Abl interaction through the SH2 domain of Abl, which has a high affinity for the pYXXP motif (38Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Tyr682 is expected to be deleterious for the binding of the PTB domains of Fe65, X11, and mDab1 because it was demonstrated that, at least for Fe65 and X11, this residue is crucial for the formation of the complexes with APP (3Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and it is a hydrophobic residue in most of the known PTB binding sites (39van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As reported in Fig. 4, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that Abl, mDab1, and Mena are involved in common molecular machineries. It was, in fact, demonstrated that mDab1 binds through its PTB domain with the cytosolic domain of APP (7Homayouni R. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7507-7515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gerler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and that Mena interacts with the WW domain of Fe65 (13Ermekova K-S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which, in turn, interacts with APP. Considering the results reported in this paper, it can be hypothesized that Abl, mDab1, and Mena compete for the anchoring to the same intracellular site: mDab1 by competing with Fe65 for the binding to the cytodomain of APP; and Abl and Mena by competing for the binding to the WW domain of Fe65 (Fig. 4). It is worth noting that the Tyr682 of human APP695 and the YENP motif are both conserved among all the known APPs in primates, rodents, Drosophila, andCaenorhabditis and are present also in the APP-related proteins APLP1 and APLP2. Considering that the overall sequence identity between Drosophila APP (Appl) and the mammalian APPs is less than 30%, the 100% conservation of the cytosolic motif containing the phosphorylated tyrosine suggests that it plays a key functional role. This means that the understanding of the molecular basis of the different phenotypes observed in insects bearing mutations of Drosophila Abl (DAbl) and/ordisabled and/or enabled should also take into account the involvement of APP. Appl null flies show behavioral defects that are rescued by human APP, and the possible correlation with the defects caused by DAbl,disabled, and enabled gene mutations is not apparent. However, one could gain better insight by the analysis of the phenotypes of insects bearing combined mutations of Applwith the other three genes. For example, the effects of disabled gene mutation on the Abl −/− flies also could be the consequence of the direct interaction of these two proteins with APP, whereas the amelioration observed in Drosophila Abl −/−disabled −/− following the mutation of theenabled gene could be also based on the competition between the enabled and DAbl gene products for the binding to Appl through Drosophila Fe65. Although the WW domain of Fe65 interacts in vitro with both c-Abl and Abl-PP, only the complexes between Fe65 and the active form of Abl, and not those with the wild type c-Abl, were found in cell extracts. This effect could be due to a lower amount of c-Abl than Abl-PP available for the formation of the in vivocomplexes; or it could be due to a low affinity of c-Abl for the WW domain of Fe65 so that, in vivo, it cannot form a significant number of complexes with Fe65 because of the competition of the other ligands of the WW domain of this protein. Furthermore, active Abl probably has a different conformation than c-Abl, thus acquiring a higher affinity for the WW domain. On the contrary, the APP-Abl direct interaction probably requires an active Abl, because the binding is based on a pTyr-SH2 interaction. It has been hypothesized often that APP could have some role in signaling, and in a recent review article, Bothwell and Giniger (32Bothwell M. Giniger E. Cell. 2000; 102: 271-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggested the possibility that intracellular signaling could be involved in the development of AD. Their hypothesis takes into account the numerous reports on various proteins that could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD and suggests a role for c-Abl as a modulator of APP biology. Our results support their hypothesis. A point that deserves attention, besides those discussed in the mentioned review article, concerns the possible involvement of p73 in the molecular machinery under examination. In fact, this protein is a key regulator of apoptosis that binds to and is activated by Abl as a response to DNA damage (40Gong JG Costanzo A. Yang H.-Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M.

Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and the role of its phosphorylation by Abl has not been addressed. The finding that active Abl binds to APP suggested an examination of the possible regulatory effects of this binding on the p73 phosphorylation by Abl and the consequences on this regulation of the enhanced APP proteolytic processing characteristic of AD. Our results support the hypothesis that Fe65 connects Abl to the APP-centered molecular machinery. However, other possible roles of the Fe65·Abl complex should be examined, as for example those suggested by the observation that both Fe65 and Abl, further than in the cytoplasm, are also localized in the nucleus (24Van Etten R.A.

Our understanding of checkpoints stems mainly from genetic studies in yeast and mice, in vitro studies with amphibian egg extracts, and studies of human syndromes associated with predisposition to cancer. Compounds that inhibit the G2 checkpoint may be useful additional tools to study the checkpoint mechanism in mammalian systems. G2 checkpoint inhibitors also may be valuable in cancer therapy to enhance the effectiveness of DNA-damaging agents in tumors with a defective G1 DNA damage checkpoint, such as those with mutated p53 (26Weinert T.

From the spongeStylissa flabeliformis, we have isolated debromohymenialdisine (DBH), a compound structurally distinct from previously known G2 checkpoint inhibitors. We have characterized the G2 checkpoint inhibitory activity of DBH and analogs, and we describe its effects on checkpoint and signal transduction protein kinases. Specimens of S. flabeliformis were collected in the waters off Motupore Island in Papua New Guinea. The samples were frozen on site and transported to Vancouver over dry ice. A frozen sample (87 g wet weight) was thawed and extracted exhaustively with methanol. The methanol extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give a dark brown solid. This crude extract was fractionated on a Sephadex LH-20 column using methanol as the eluent. Active fractions were identified using the G2 checkpoint inhibition assay (29Roberge M. Berlinck R.G.S.

Further purification was achieved by repeated fractionation on reversed-phase HPLC using 80:20:0.05 water/methanol/trifluoroacetic acid as the eluent. The pure fractions of DBH and hymenialdisine were converted from trifluoroacetic salts to the hydrochloride salts by the addition of 3 n HCl followed by concentration under reduced pressure. Debromopyrrololactam was obtained by subjecting DBH to a 5% K2CO3solution followed by concentration in vacuo. It then was purified using HPLC with 80:20 water/methanol as the eluent.

MCF-7 mp53 cells were seeded at 1000 cells/well in 96-well plates, grown overnight, and treated or not treated with DBH for 24 h. The drug was removed, and cells were allowed to grow in fresh medium until those not treated with the drug approached confluence, which was typically 4–6 days. Cell proliferation was measured as follows: 25 μl of a 5 mg/ml solution of 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide in phosphate-buffered saline was added to cells in the presence of 100 μl of cell culture medium. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate dissolved in dimethylformamide/water (1:1), pH 4.7, was added, and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured after overnight incubation. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, and cell pellets were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.

The nitrocellulose membrane was probed with Cdc2 rabbit antiserum (KAP-CC001, StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit IgG (13858-014, Life Technologies, Inc.) in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the antigen·antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce) and exposed on film (X-OMAT, Eastman Kodak Co.).

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5701-5706PubMed Google Scholar) was used to screen several thousand crude organic extracts from marine invertebrates. An extract from a sponge collected in Papua New Guinea showed activity. A compound with strong G2 checkpoint inhibitory activity was isolated by chromatographic procedures (see “Experimental Procedures”) using the cell-based assay to direct purification. The active compound was identified as DBH (Fig. 1) by analysis of its mass spectrometry and NMR data and comparison with published values (57Sharma G.M. Buyer J. S Pomerantz M.W. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1980; 545: 435-436Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DBH was identified first in 1980 as a yellow compound from the sponge Phakellia flabelata (57Sharma G.M. Buyer J. S Pomerantz M.W. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1980; 545: 435-436Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The extract also contained minor amounts of the structurally related compounds hymenialdisine, debromoaxinohydantoin, and debromopyrrololactam (Fig. 1). The activity profile of DBH as a G2 checkpoint inhibitor is shown in Fig.2 A. MCF-7 mp53 cells arrested in the G2 phase after exposure to ionizing radiation were incubated with DBH for 8 h in the presence of nocodazole to trap cells in mitosis. The number of mitotic cells was counted by microscopy. DBH showed dose-dependent G2checkpoint inhibition with an IC50 of 8 μmand maximal activity at 40 μm. Higher concentrations caused a decrease in activity, a phenomenon also seen with other checkpoint inhibitors (29Roberge M. Berlinck R.G.S. Xu L. Anderson H.J. Lim L.Y. Curman D. Stringer C.M.

Cycling cells were incubated with DBH for 20 h, the compound was washed away, and the cells were allowed to grow. Cell proliferation was determined after 3 days using the MTT assay. DBH inhibited cell proliferation but not potently, with an IC50 of 25 μm (Fig. 2 B). Hymenialdisine was active also as a checkpoint inhibitor with an IC50 of 6 μm (TableI). Debromoaxinohydantoin and debromopyrrololactam, which were present also in the sponge extract, and the related compounds 2-aminoimidazole and 2- amino-4,5-imidazole-dicarbonitrile obtained from commercial sources showed no activity at all concentrations tested (Table I). Only DBH was isolated in sufficient quantities for the additional studies described below.Table IG2 checkpoint inhibition by DBH and related compoundsCompoundG2 checkpoint inhibition IC50μmDebromohymenialdisine8 ± 4Hymenialdisine6 ± 3Debromoaxinohydantoin≫200Debromopyrrololactam≫2002-Aminoimidazole≫10,0002-Amino-4,5-imidazole-dicarbonitrile≫10,000 Open table in a new tab When cells are arrested in the G2 phase by DNA damage, Cdc2 kinase is maintained in an inactive state by phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues in its ATP-binding site. Entry into mitosis requires the dephosphorylation of these residues by Cdc25 protein phosphatases. We first determined whether DBH overcomes G2 arrest by affecting the phosphorylation and the protein kinase activity of Cdc2. Extracts were prepared from cells arrested in mitosis by treatment with nocodazole, from cells arrested in G2 phase after exposure to ionizing radiation, or from cells arrested in G2 phase and then treated with 40 μm DBH for up to 6 h. Cellular proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting using a Cdc2 antibody. Depending on its inhibitory phosphorylation state, Cdc2 may be detected as slow migrating bands corresponding to phosphorylated inactive kinase and a faster migrating band corresponding to hypophosphorylated active Cdc2. As shown in Fig. 3 A, cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole had no detectable phosphorylated inhibited Cdc2, whereas cells arrested in G2after irradiation contained phosphorylated Cdc2. Cells arrested in G2 and incubated with DBH showed a time-dependent decrease in the amount of phosphorylated Cdc2, with the slowest migrating band essentially becoming undetectable by 6 h. The well characterized G2 checkpoint inhibitor caffeine also caused a decrease of phosphorylated Cdc2 (Fig.3 A). We next examined the activity of immunoprecipitated Cdc2 using histone H1 as a substrate. Cdc2 activity was high in cells arrested in mitosis and very low in cells arrested in G2 phase by irradiation (Fig. 3 B). DBH caused a concentration-dependent activation of Cdc2. DBH at 4 and 40 μm activated Cdc2 to levels activated by 0.2 and 2 mm caffeine, respectively (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results indicate that DBH overcomes G2 arrest by interfering with the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 kinase and causing its activation. Hymenialdisine was shown recently to inhibit several protein kinases in vitro (58Meijer L. Thunissen A.-M.W.H. White A.W. Garnier M. Nikolic M. Tsai L.-H. Walter J. Cleverley K.E. Salinas P.C.

However, this study did not test kinases involved in the G2checkpoint. The checkpoint inhibitor 7-hydroxystaurosporine inhibits Chk1 but not Chk2 (43Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T.

The effect of DBH on the protein kinase activity of purified DNA-PK was determined using a synthetic peptide derived from p53 as described previously (59Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). More than 70% of the protein kinase activity of DNA-PK was retained in the presence of 20 μm DBH, whereas the known DNA-PK inhibitor wortmannin (1 μm) effectively abolished DNA-PK activity (Fig.4 A). To determine the effect of DBH on the protein kinase activity of ATM and ATR, the proteins were immunoprecipitated from human lymphoblastoid cells and assayed in the presence of different concentrations of DBH. DBH did not cause significant inhibition of ATM and ATR in these assays, suggesting that it does not act on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like enzymes (Fig.4 B). The effect of DBH on Chk2 activity was also measured. As shown in Fig.5, DBH was a potent inhibitor of Chk2 kinase activity with an IC50 of 3.5 μm. DBH also inhibited autophosphorylation of Chk2 (data not shown). The activity of human recombinant Chk1 was assayed using a Cdc25C-derived peptide as a substrate (55Hutchins J"

Following tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT3 proteins dimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and activate specific target genes. Activation is transient, and down-regulation of STAT3 signaling occurs within a few hours. In this study, we show that cyclin D1 inhibits STAT3 activation. In co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, cyclin D1 was found to associate with the activation domain of STAT3 upon interleukin-6 stimulation. Overexpression of cyclin D1 inhibited transcriptional activation by STAT3 proteins. This effect was not shared by cyclin E, was independent of association with Cdk4, and was unaffected by inhibitors of Cdk4. Whereas cyclin D1 had no effect on the steady-state level of STAT3 proteins in the cytoplasm, it was found to reduce the STAT3 nuclear level in HepG2 cells. These results suggest a model by which cyclin D1 is part of a feedback network controlling the down-regulation of STAT3 activity and highlight a new activity for this cell cycle regulatory protein.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). Finally, STAT3 is also required for the IL-6-mediated activation of the c-myc gene (11Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukada T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and for the expression of cyclin D1 (5Bromberg J. Wrzeszczynska M. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R. Albanese C. Darnell J. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), two key components in the regulation of cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. One of the important questions to be resolved is what molecular basis governs the activation of cell cycle progression by STAT3 transcription factors and how these proteins are inactivated. Cell cycle activation is coordinated by d-type cyclins, which are rate-limiting and essential for the progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (12Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 547-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). D-type cyclins bind to and activate the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6 (13Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). This binding allows for efficient phosphorylation of the critical downstream target of cyclin D, the retinoblastoma protein Rb. In the G1 phase of the cell cycle, Rb is hypophosphorylated and binds to the E2F family of cell cycle transcription factors (14Dynlacht B. Nature. 1997; 389: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This Rb·E2F complex forms an active transcriptional repressor at the promoter of cell cycle genes that is responsible for growth suppression (15Zhang H.S. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 53-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of Rb to E2F and the ability to repress transcription are modulated by the state of phosphorylation of Rb catalyzed by cyclin-dependent kinases. The complete phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin D1/Cdk4 and cyclin E/Cdk2 is necessary for its inactivation, resulting in the release of Rb-associated E2F and the activation of S phase genes (16Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A. Ma D. Luo R.X. Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 17Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Nat.

Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). In the past 3 years, several observations have raised the possibility that cyclin D1 has roles at other stages of the cell cycle and that these new activities are unrelated to its function as a Cdk regulatory subunit (19Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: M17-M22PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 can activate estrogen receptor transcription through a direct interaction with the ligand-binding domain of the receptor (20Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 21Zwijsen R.M. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). This effect is independent of Cdk4 and is explained by the recruitment of the SRC1a family of coactivators by cyclin D1 (22Zwijsen R.M. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In line with these observations, cyclin D1 inhibits transcriptional activation by the v-myb oncogene, and this repression is also independent of a complex formation with Cdk4 (23Horstmann S. Ferrari S. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,24Ganter B. Fu S. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of another Myb-like protein, DMP1, is also antagonized by D-type cyclins through a Cdk-independent mechanism (25Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Finally, cyclin D1 has been shown to repress muscle differentiation and MyoD-mediated transcription in part through an Rb-independent mechanism (26Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies establish a new Cdk-independent role of cyclin D1 as a transcriptional regulator (19Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: M17-M22PubMed Google Scholar). STAT proteins activate the expression of the cyclin D1 gene through the recognition of a conserved element in the promoter of the gene (5Bromberg J. Wrzeszczynska M. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R. Albanese C. Darnell J. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar, 28Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). As one of the target genes activated by the STAT cascade, cyclin D1 is probably an important mediator of the STAT-dependent growth of hematopoietic cells. However, the exact role of this protein in this signaling pathway remains to be determined. In this study, we show that following IL-6 stimulation, cyclin D1 interacts with STAT3 and inhibits its transcriptional activity. This effect is not shared by cyclin E, is independent of Cdk4, and is related to reduced STAT3 nuclear expression in HepG2 cells. These results reveal an unexpected relationship between cyclin D1 and STAT3 proteins and led us to propose that cyclin D1 is part of a feedback network controlling the down-regulation of STAT3 activity. Cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum or in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 ng/ml granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor for TF1 cells. Purified recombinant cytokines were obtained from Dr. K. Turner (Genetics Institute, Boston, MA). Vectors expressing cyclin D1 (pRC/cmv), p16INK4 (pcDNA3), and cyclin D1-KE (pRC/cmv) were kind gifts of Drs. P. Whyte and R. Bernards, respectively. The Gal4-STAT3 and Gal4-VP16 fusion proteins and the Gal4-luciferase reporter gene system were kindly provided by Drs. D. E. Levy and F. Gouilleux. Plasmid expressing gp130 has been described previously (29Robledo O. Auguste P. Coupey L. Praloran V. Chevalier S. Pouplard A. Gascan H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1391-13919Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies recognizing STAT3 (C20) and cyclin D1 (H-295) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies directed against phospho-STAT3 Tyr705 and phospho-STAT3 Ser727 were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Expression vectors were used as templates for polymerase chain reaction amplification of various portions of cyclin D1 and STAT3. GST-cyclin D1 fusion constructs were prepared in pGEX-2T using oligonucleotide primers containingBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites corresponding to amino acids 1–295 of cyclin D1. Histidine-tagged STAT3 fusion constructs were prepared in pET15b using oligonucleotide primers containing BamHI restriction sites corresponding to amino acids 716–770 of STAT3. 2Details of constructs are available on request. Transfection experiments were done using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and were repeated at least five times. COS cells were transfected following the DEAE-dextran method. The amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by addition of appropriate amounts of the parental empty expression vector (pRC/cmv). For nuclear extracts, HepG2 cells were plated in 15-cm plates at a density of 8 × 106 cells/plate and serum-starved for 1–3 days; and after two washings with cold phosphate-buffered saline, nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Lee et al.(30Lee K.A.W. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (10 mmHepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) was added to the plates. After three cycles of freeze-thawing, cytoplasmic extracts were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 420 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, nuclear extracts were spun down at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. Nuclear extracts were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature in 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8), 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor. Where indicated, 5-μg extracts were preincubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of polyclonal antibodies (C20) directed against STAT3 in the presence of 1% Brij 96. A double-stranded nucleotide containing a STAT3 consensus binding site derived from the c-fos gene (siem ( s is-inductibleelement), 5′-CATTTCCCGTAAATCTTGTCG-3′) was end-labeled using T4 kinase, and 10 pg of probe (20,000 cpm) was then added to the protein mixture for 15 min. Samples were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (30:1) and separated by electrophoresis in 50 mm Tris, 0.38 m glycine, and 1 mmEDTA (pH 8.5). Gels were then dried and visualized by autoradiography. Nuclear cell extracts (1–5 mg) were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C on a rotator, followed by addition of 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Cyclin D1 was immunoprecipitated in the presence of 1% Brij 97, whereas STAT3 proteins were recovered in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer (0.1 m KHPO4 (pH 7.8) and 0.1% Triton X-100), boiled for 5 min, and loaded on polyacrylamide gel. Following electrotransfer, blots were washed five times and incubated overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris (pH 8) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 6% bovine serum albumin. Blots were then incubated with the indicated antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing 6% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween, washed five times, and further incubated with antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Bacterial cultures (Escherichia colistrain BL21 or DH5) expressing fusion proteins were grown in LB medium and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside after the absorbance had reached 0.6. Following centrifugation, bacterial pellets were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EDTA. Extracts were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography following the procedures provided by the suppliers. 100–200 ng of purified His-STAT3Δ1–716 (see Fig. 5) was mixed with 100–200 ng of GST or GST-cyclin D1 coupled to glutathione beads and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl. Beads were then washed three times with binding buffer and one time with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), boiled for 5 min, and loaded on polyacrylamide gel for Western blot analysis. The C20 polyclonal antibody was used to detect His-STAT3Δ1–716, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal part of STAT3. HepG2 cells were plated in 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well. Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 150 μl of lysis buffer was added to the wells. Extracts were then used directly to measure luciferase activity by integrating total light emission over a 10-s period using a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. Luciferase activity was normalized based on protein concentrations. To determine whether cyclin D1 might be involved in the regulation of STAT3 activation, we first investigated whether it could bind specifically to STAT3 proteins. Following IL-6 stimulation, nuclear extracts were recovered from HepG2 hepatoma cells, and co-immunoprecipitations were performed alternatively with polyclonal antibodies directed against cyclin D1 (Fig.1 A, lane 2), polyclonal antibodies directed against STAT3 (lane 4), or nonspecific antibodies (lanes 1 and 3). Proteins present in the immunoprecipitates were revealed by immunoblotting with the reciprocal antibodies. In both cases, cyclin D1 and STAT3 were found to co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 1 and 3 with lanes 2 and 4). Similar effects were also observed in a different cell line that expresses the IL-6 receptor transducing complex, the human erythroleukemia TF1 cell line (Fig. 1 B). This interaction was dependent on the presence of IL-6 since a very weak interaction was detected between the two proteins when cells were serum-starved for 2 days. By contrast, cyclin D1 and STAT3 co-immunoprecipitated in response to IL-6 stimulation (Fig.1 C, lanes 1–4). Whether the phosphorylation has a direct effect on the interaction or is only related to an increased quantity of STAT3 in the nucleus remains to be determined. Importantly, these co-immunoprecipitations were carried out using nuclear extracts from non-transfected cells; therefore, the association between cyclin D1 and STAT3 does not require that these proteins be overexpressed. Altogether, these results indicate that STAT3 signaling proteins interact with cyclin D1. Recent results have shown that cyclin D1 can inhibit the transcriptional activity of the MyoD, v-Myb, and DMP1 transcription factors (23Horstmann S. Ferrari S. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Ganter B. Fu S. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Having shown that cyclin D1 and STAT3 could interact, we therefore hypothesized that this interaction might affect the transcriptional activity of STAT3. To verify this, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct containing two STAT3 consensus binding sites upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter together with vectors expressing STAT3 and cyclin D1. Following transfection, cells were serum-starved and stimulated with IL-6, and luciferase activity was measured after 15 h in cytoplasmic extracts. Inclusion of a STAT3 expression vector in the transfection mixture led to a 6-fold increase in expression following cell stimulation (Fig.2 A, bars 1 and2). Activation by STAT3 was inhibited in the presence of a cyclin D1 expression vector (Fig. 2 A, compare bars 2 and 3). Importantly, cyclin D1 was also able to block transcriptional activation in the absence of a STAT3 expression vector, suggesting that the endogenous protein is also inhibited (Fig.2 A, compare bars 4–6). The same effect was also observed in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (Fig.2 B, compare bars 2 and 3) and oncostatin M (Fig. 2 C, compare bars 2 and3), indicating that the cyclin D1 inhibitory effect is shared by cytokines using the STAT3 signaling pathway. The cyclin D1-mediated inhibitory effect on IL-6- and leukemia inhibitory factor-induced transactivation increased when increasing amounts of cyclin D1 expression vectors were included in the transfection mixture (Fig. 2 D, compare bars 2–4 with bars 6–9). Thus, we concluded from these results that cyclin D1 can inhibit the transcriptional activity of STAT3 proteins. To explain the effect of cyclin D1 on STAT3 transcriptional activity, we first hypothesized that cyclin D1 might inhibit the DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor. To obtain a high transfection efficiency (>80%), COS-7 cells were transfected with vectors expressing the IL-6 receptor together with plasmids expressing STAT3 and cyclin D1. Under these experimental conditions, STAT3 DNA binding was induced following IL-6 stimulation (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 1and 2). EMSA experiments were conducted in the presence of antibodies against STAT3 to prove that the binding was specific for this protein (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 4 and5). Overexpression of cyclin D1 did not affect STAT3 DNA-binding activity (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2and 3), although cyclin D1 was clearly overexpressed (compare lanes 7 and 8 in the lower panel) and did interact with STAT3 (compare lanes 7 and8 in the upper panel). In line with these results, Western blot experiments indicated that overexpression of cyclin D1 in COS cells did not affect the nuclear expression of STAT3 or its phosphorylation on Tyr705 (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). Thus, these results might indicate that cyclin D1 has no effect on STAT3 DNA binding in COS cells. However, this conclusion depends on the stoichiometry, and it remains to be determined if all STAT3 proteins are in complex with cyclin D and whether STAT3 is capable of binding both cyclin D1 and DNA simultaneously. Following the study of the effect of cyclin D1 on STAT3 DNA binding, we then hypothesized that it should inhibit the activity of a chimeric Gal4-STAT3 fusion protein. Using a Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter gene, we found that cyclin D1 was able to repress transactivation by Gal4-STAT3 (Fig. 4, compare bars 2 and 3). Importantly, cyclin D1 had no effect on the transcriptional activity of a control Gal4-VP16 fusion protein (Fig. 4, compare bars 5 and 6). This result further suggested that the effect of cyclin D1 was probably not mediated through inhibition of DNA binding and also indicated that cyclin D1 may interact with the carboxyl-terminal activation domain of STAT3. To verify this, in vitro pull-down experiments were performed using bacterially produced full-length GST-cyclin D1 protein and His6-tagged STAT3 containing amino acids 716–770 corresponding to the activation domain of STAT3 (STAT3Δ1–716) (Fig.5 A). We found that His-tagged STAT3Δ1–716 could be retained by a GST-cyclin D1 fusion protein immobilized on glutathione beads, whereas it did not bind to GST beads alone (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 1 and2). To confirm this result, we also determined that GST-cyclin D1 could be retained by His-tagged STAT3Δ1–716 immobilized on beads, whereas it bound weakly to histidine beads alone (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Pull-down experiments were also performed using HepG2 nuclear extracts mixed with immobilized GST or GST-cyclin D1. The results indicated that the endogenous STAT3 protein could also interact with GST-cyclin D1 (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 5 and 6). Thus, we concluded from these results that cyclin D1 binds at least to the carboxyl-terminal activation domain of STAT3. Moreover, these pull-down experiments also suggest that the interaction between cyclin D1 and STAT3 is probably direct, although we cannot rule out the possibility that cyclin D1 functions via another partner that could be copurified from the bacteria with His-tagged STAT3 or GST-cyclin D1. We then verified the specificity of the cyclin D1 inhibitory effects among the other cyclins. STAT3 activity is down-regulated in HepG2 cells during the first 6 h of IL-6 stimulation (31Coqueret O. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18794-18800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To ascertain the physiological significance of the results, we reasoned that any cyclin that would affect the activity of STAT3 proteins should be expressed when the transcription factor is present in the nucleus. Among the different cyclins, cyclin A is induced at the beginning of the S phase of the cell cycle, whereas cyclin B appears at the end of the S phase and in G2. Therefore, these proteins are unlikely to modulate STAT3 activity. By contrast, cyclin D1 is induced in early G1, and cyclin E could be expressed in the middle of G1 (12Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 547-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). Therefore, cyclin E could theoretically also affect the transcriptional activity of STAT3. To verify this, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter construct together with plasmids expressing STAT3 and cyclin D1 or cyclin E. Transcriptional activation by STAT3 was almost completely abolished in the presence of a cyclin D1 expression vector, whereas cyclin E was unable to affect STAT3 proteins, confirming the specificity of cyclin D1 inhibition (Fig.6 A, compare bars 2–4). To extend these results, we then investigated if Cdk4, the kinase partner of cyclin D1, was required in this inhibitory effect. To this end, we used a mutant of cyclin D1 (cyclin D1-KE) that carries a mutation in the cyclin box changing the lysine at amino acid 114 to glutamic acid. This alteration resulted in a mutant cyclin D1-KE protein that fails to bind to Cdk4 (32Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Eaton E.N. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Like wild-type cyclin D1, the cyclin D1-KE mutant inhibited transcriptional activation by STAT3 (Fig.6 B, bar 4). Importantly, EMSA experiments indicated that overexpression of cyclin D1-KE might not affect STAT3 DNA-binding activity in COS cells, confirming the results obtained with wild-type cyclin D1 (Fig. 6 B, compare lanes 5 and7). As previously reported for the v-Myb and DMP1 transcription factors (24Ganter B. Fu S. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the inhibition observed with the cyclin D1-KE mutant was consistently greater than that with the wild-type cyclin D1 (Fig. 6 B, compare bars 3 and4). It is conceivable that competition for cyclin D1 binding by endogenous Cdk4 might limit the inhibitory effect of cyclin D1 and its interaction with STAT3. If so, this would explain why the cyclin D1-KE mutant is a more potent STAT3 inhibitor that wild-type cyclin D1. To confirm these results, we also used a specific Cdk4 inhibitor, p16INK4. INK4 can compete with cyclin D1 for binding to Cdk4, but can also inhibit Cdk4 without dissociating cyclin D1, resulting in INK4·cyclin D·Cdk4 complexes (33Jeffrey P.D. Tong L. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Significantly, cotransfection of p16INK4 had no effect on the cyclin D1-mediated inhibition of STAT3 transcriptional activity (Fig. 6 C, compare bars 3and 4), further suggesting that the inhibitory effect is mediated by “free” cyclin D1. Taken together, these results suggest that cyclin D1-mediated inhibition of the transcriptional activity of STAT3 is independent of the ability of cyclin D1 to activate Cdk4. As a first attempt to characterize the inhibitory effect of cyclin D1 on STAT3 transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells, we hypothesized that cyclin D1 may also regulate the nuclear level of STAT3 in this cell line. To test this hypothesis, HepG2 cells were stably transfected with an expression vector encoding cyclin D1 or the corresponding parental plasmid. Following G418 selection, cyclin D1 was clearly overexpressed compared with control clones (Fig. 7 A,lanes 1 and 2). STAT3 proteins, once activated in response to IL-6, become phosphorylated on Tyr705, dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus. To verify if the down-regulation of STAT3 transcriptional activity could be related to reduced nuclear expression, Western blot experiments were performed on cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts. Following IL-6 stimulation, cytoplasmic STAT3 was expressed (Fig. 7 B, upper panel) and phosphorylated on Tyr705 in control cells as well as in two different clones overexpressing cyclin D1 (Fig.7 C, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–9). However, the cytoplasmic phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr705 was reduced in clone 1 (Fig. 7 C, comparelanes 2 and 3 with lanes 5 and6). In the presence of cyclin D1, the expression level of STAT3 in the nucleus was very weak (Fig. 7 B, lower panels, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–9), but remained normal under control conditions. Interestingly, STAT3 was almost absent from the nucleus of clone 2, and these cells were found to express higher levels of cyclin D1 (data not shown). Importantly, this effect was not due to a general defect of STAT3 translocation since nuclear expression of the transcription factor could be detected upon a longer exposure of the blot (Fig. 7 D, comparelanes 1–4 with lane 5). We concluded from these results that cyclin D1 decreased the steady-state level of STAT3 proteins in the nucleus. Thus, this down-regulation might explain the negative effect of cyclin D1 on STAT3 transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells. If this hypothesis is correct, we then reasoned that cyclin D1 should not interact with STAT3 at the time of its maximal activation, whereas STAT3 should disappear from the nucleus with the appearance of cyclin D1·STAT3 complexes. To verify this, HepG2 cells were stimulated with IL-6, and nuclear activation of STAT3 was evaluated in parallel with the appearance of cyclin D1·STAT3 complexes. After 15 min, STAT3 translocated to the nucleus and was phosphorylated on Tyr705 and Ser727; however, no interaction could be detected between STAT3 and cyclin D1 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 7 E, lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, cyclin D1 and STAT3 were found to interact after 2 h of stimulation, when the nuclear level of STAT3 and its phosphorylation status were found to decrease (Fig.7 E, lanes 2 and 3). These results, together with the evidence regarding the interaction of STAT3 and cyclin D1, led us to propose that the transcriptional inhibition of STAT3 by cyclin D1 could be mediated through reduced nuclear expression in HepG2 cells. The results presented in this study describe a new pathway for inhibiting STAT3 activation and establish a new role for cyclin D1 as a STAT3 inhibitor. We have shown that cyclin D1 can interact with STAT3 proteins and block their activity, suggesting a novel biological role for cyclin D1 in the feedback regulation of IL-6-type cytokine signaling pathways. At the nuclear level, STAT3 activation is transient, and activated transcription factors disappear from the nucleus within 1–6 h after ligand stimulation (34Hoey T. Schindler U. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Removal of activated STAT proteins from the nucleus has been shown to require phosphatase action, with reappearance of the STAT in the cytoplasm in a dephosphorylated state (35Haspel R. Darnell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STAT proteins can also be detected in association with ubiquitin, and proteasome inhibitors prolong the activation of these transcription factors, suggesting that proteolytic degradation participates in the negative regulation of nuclear STAT activation (36Kim T. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Association with inhibitory molecules has also been recently described: the PIAS family proteins are negative regulators of STAT activity, and they associate with STAT proteins and inhibit DNA binding (37Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Additional stimuli can also block the STAT signaling cascade in the nucleus, and we have recently shown that the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 also blocks the IL-6 signaling pathway through a feedback mechanism (31Coqueret O. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18794-18800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple levels of regulation act upstream or at the level of STAT3 proteins, and the results presented in this study extend the observation that gene activation by STAT3 proteins is affected by signals that control cell cycle progression. Cell cycle progression is activated by the binding of D-type cyclins to Cdk4 and Cdk6; therefore, cyclin D1 is generally considered a Cdk activator (13Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). However, the cyclin D1-mediated repression of STAT3 transcriptional activity is unrelated to its function as a Cdk4 regulatory subunit, whereas cyclin E is unable to affect STAT3 proteins. Therefore, the transcriptional activity of cyclin D1 is probably unique among the cyclins and is not mediated by Cdk4. Importantly, similar observations have been reported for the estrogen-, v-Myb-, DMP1-, and MyoD-regulated genes, where cyclin D1 regulates the transcriptional activity independently of Cdk4 (23Horstmann S. Ferrari S. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Ganter B. Fu S. Lipsick J.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that cyclin D1 can act via two different mechanisms: as a Cdk activator, it regulates cell cycle progression; and as a transcriptional regulator, it modulates the activity of transcription factors (19Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: M17-M22PubMed Google Scholar). This effect remains to be clarified, however, since cyclin D1 is a positive regulator of estrogen receptors, whereas it inhibits the activity of the v-Myb, DMP1, MyoD, and STAT3 transcription factors. A few possibilities can be raised concerning the molecular mechanisms whereby STAT3 is inhibited by cyclin D1. The cyclin is able to inhibit the transcriptional activity of a chimeric Gal4-STAT3 protein containing the activation domain of STAT3. The domain that modulates the interaction between cyclin D1 and STAT3 proteins remains to be fully identified; but, as a first attempt to map this region, we have shown that cyclin D1 is at least able to interact with the activation domain of STAT3. In light of this result, we might speculate that cyclin D1 could occlude this domain, thereby blocking the interactions of STAT3 with the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery or with its essential cofactors such as CBP/p300 (38Paulson M. Pisharody S. Pan L. Guadagno S. Mui A. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25343-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Steric hindrance would, in this case, lead to transcriptional repression. Interestingly, CBP/p300 has been recently shown to bind the carboxyl-terminal part of STAT3 (38Paulson M. Pisharody S. Pan L. Guadagno S. Mui A. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25343-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and cyclin D1 has been shown to interact with essential transcriptional coactivators (22Zwijsen R.M. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Additionally, the binding of cyclin D1 within the activation domain of STAT3 could inhibit the phosphorylation of serine 727, a critical residue involved in the transcriptional activity of STAT3 (39Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Again, interaction of cyclin D1 with STAT3 could reduce the accessibility to Ser727. A second hypothesis can probably be raised concerning the molecular mechanisms whereby STAT3 signaling is inhibited, as we found that cyclin D1 decreased the steady-state level of STAT3 proteins in the nuclei of HepG2 cells. This was not a general defect since STAT3 can enter the nucleus in the presence of cyclin D1, but to a lesser extent. These observations raise the possibility that STAT3 nuclear localization is regulated following its association with cyclin D1, maybe in a cell-cycle dependent manner. In line with this hypothesis, the transcriptional activity of STAT1 has also been shown to be differently regulated during cell cycle progression (40Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This effect remains to be clarified, but we speculate that STAT3 inhibition is mediated through two potential mechanisms: occlusion of the transactivation function and a decrease in nuclear amount. Altogether, these results point to a novel biological role for cyclin D1 as an important inhibitor of STAT3 transcriptional activity. We propose a model by which IL-6 stimulation induces the interaction between cyclin D1 and STAT3 proteins, leading to the feedback down-regulation of STAT3 activation. These findings extend the role of cyclin D1 as a converging point of several intracellular signaling cascades. We thank Drs. R. Bernards, F. Gouilleux, D. E. Levy, and P. Whyte for the gift of various expression vectors and Dr. A. Lundquist for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2033140682,"A novel “weak toxin” (WTX) from Naja kaouthia snake venom competes with [125I]α-bungarotoxin for binding to the membrane-bound Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor (AChR), with an IC50 of ∼2.2 μm. In this respect, it is ∼300 times less potent than neurotoxin II fromNaja oxiana and α-cobratoxin from N. kaouthia, representing short-type and long-type α-neurotoxins, respectively. WTX and α-cobratoxin displaced [125I]α-bungarotoxin from the Escherichia coli-expressed fusion protein containing the rat α7 AChR N-terminal domain 1–208 preceded by glutathioneS-transferase with IC50 values of 4.3 and 9.1 μm, respectively, whereas for neurotoxin II the IC50 value was >100 μm. Micromolar concentrations of WTX inhibited acetylcholine-activated currents inXenopus oocyte-expressed rat muscle AChR and human and rat α7 AChRs, inhibiting the latter most efficiently (IC50 of ∼8.3 μm). Thus, a virtually nontoxic “three-fingered” protein WTX, although differing from α-neurotoxins by an additional disulfide in the N-terminal loop, can be classified as a weak α-neurotoxin. It differs from the short chain α-neurotoxins, which potently block the muscle-type but not the α7 AChRs, and is closer to the long α-neurotoxins, which have comparable potency against the above-mentioned AChR types.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 400: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Toxins of this type were later referred to as melanoleuca (2Joubert F.J. Taljaard N. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1980; 361: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or miscellaneous-type (3Shafqat J. Siddiqi A.R. Zaidi Z.H. Jornvall H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) toxins. In protein data banks (e.g. Swiss-Prot) they are classified together with some other toxins in the group of weak toxins. At present, around 15 amino acid sequences of such toxins are known. They consist of 62–68 amino acid residues, contain five disulfide bridges, and belong to the group of snake venom “three-fingered” toxins, whose characteristic feature is the presence of three disulfide-confined loops (“fingers”) (4Menez A. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1557-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Tsetlin V.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, most other three-fingered toxins, including cardiotoxins, muscarinic toxins, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and the so-called short chain α-neurotoxins, contain four disulfide bridges. A fifth disulfide bridge is present in the long chain α-neurotoxins, such as α-bungarotoxin (αBgt)1 from Bungarus multicinctus or α-cobratoxin from Naja kaouthia (CTX) and κ-bungarotoxin (κBgt), which together with short α-neurotoxins are potent antagonists of different classes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) (for reviews see Refs. 6Changeux J.-P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 7Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J.

In the long chain α- and κ-neurotoxins the fifth disulfide bridge is located in the central loop II, whereas in weak toxins the additional disulfide is in the N-terminal loop I (see Fig.1 B). The available data show that residues of loops I, II, and III of α-neurotoxins participate in binding to AChRs (for reviews see Refs. 4Menez A. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1557-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Tsetlin V.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, and 7Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, depending on the type of α-neurotoxin (short or long) and AChR (muscle-type or neuronal α7), the role of particular loops may vary. For example, there are numerous data demonstrating the involvement of identified residues in the central loop II of short chain and long chain neurotoxins in binding both to muscle-type (9Ackermann E.J.

Interestingly, a fifth disulfide in loop II of the long α-neurotoxins is essential for binding to α7 AChR but not to the Torpedo AChR (14Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P.

The residues of loop I in short α-neurotoxins were shown to be involved in binding to the Torpedo receptor (15Tremeau O. Lemaire C. Drevet P. Pinkasfeld S. Ducancel F. Boulain J.C. Menez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas loop I in long α-neurotoxins appears to be less important for the interaction with Torpedo and α7 AChRs (11Antil S.

WTX was found to bind to the membrane-bound Torpedo californicaAChR, although much less efficiently than a short chain neurotoxin, NT-II, or a long one, CTX. However, WTX and CTX were virtually equipotent in binding to the soluble N-terminal domain of the rat α7 AChR expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Subsequent electrophysiological experiments revealed that in the micromolar range WTX blocked human and rat α7 AChRs as well as rat muscle AChR (16Utkin Y Kukhtina V Chiodini F Bertrand D Methfesse C Tsetlin V Abstracts of the XIIIth World Congress of the International Society on Toxinology, Paris,162.

The molecular mass of WTX was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight on a Vision 2000 (Thermo Bioanalysis Corp.) mass spectrometer. This preparation (See Fig. 1) was used for primary structure determination (17Utkin Y.N. Kukhtina V.V. Maslennikov I.V. Eletsky A.V. Starkov V.G. Weise C. Franke P. Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I.

Dergousova, E. D. Shibanova, I. E. Kasheverov, C. Methfessel, and V. I. Tsetlin, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, a gene fragment corresponding to the amino acids 1–208 was cloned into the pGEX-KG vector (21Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar) at the BamHI/HinIII sites, and the recombinant plasmids were used to transform the E. coli strain JM107. The inclusion bodies containing the target protein were washed extensively with 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl, then dissolved in 8 murea, 1 mm dithiothreitol, subsequently refolded at 10 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.1% CHAPS, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% CHAPS.Binding ExperimentsMembrane-bound AChR from T. californicaVarying concentrations of competitors were added to 50 μl of membrane suspension (25 μg of protein/ml, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0), and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a total volume of 195 μl. Then 5 μl of 0.4 μm[125I]αBgt (specific activity 45 Ci/mmol) were added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h more. The mixture was quickly filtered through Whatman GF/F filters (preincubated in 0.25% polyethylenimine for at least 2 h), the filters were washed four times with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and the radioactivity was determined in an Ultragamma γ-counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Fusion ProteinA solution of GST-α7-(1–208) protein (17 μg/ml, pH 8.0, 0.1% CHAPS) was incubated with different concentrations of competitors in a final volume of 190 μl for 1 h at room temperature. Then 10 μl of 0.4 μm[125I]αBgt were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h more. The unbound [125I]αBgt was removed by fast filtration through DE-81 filters (Whatman), and the filters were washed four times with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and counted.Immunological AssaysCTX was reduced under denaturing conditions, carboxymethylated, and used to prepare a keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate, which was employed to immunize rabbits, and to obtain polyclonal antibodies by a standard procedure (22Gullik W.J. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. 32. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 389-399Google Scholar). An immunoglobulin fraction, obtained from the antiserum by fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate, was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, dialyzed against this buffer, lyophilized, and stored at −80 °C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed in 96-well Linbro E.I.A. microtitration plates (Flow Laboratories) as in Ref. 23Richards D. Kemeny D.M. Challacombe S.J. ELISA and Other Solid Phase Immunoassays. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 345-346Google Scholar, using immunoglobulins of nonimmunized rabbits as a control. It was found that antibodies reacted with comparable efficiency with the reduced, carboxymethylated CTX and native CTX; the titers were 1:64,000 and 1:50,000, respectively.Reconstitution in Xenopus OocytesXenopus oocytes were isolated and prepared as previously described (24Bertrand D. Cooper E. Valera S. Rungger D. Ballivet M. Conn M. Methods in Neuroscience. 4. Academic Press, New York1991: 174-193Google Scholar). A volume of 10 nl containing 2 ng of expression vector cDNA was injected into the nucleus the day following the oocyte isolation. To allow good protein expression levels, oocytes were kept for 2–3 days prior to recording. Each oocyte was placed in a separate well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc) at 18 °C. Oocytes were incubated in Barth's solution, a standard medium for maintaining Xenopus oocytes in vitro, which consists of the following (in mm): NaCl 88, KCl 1, NaHCO3 2.4, HEPES 10, MgSO4 0.82, Ca(NO3)2 0.33, CaCl2 0.41. pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. To minimize contamination, the medium was filtered at 0.2 μm and supplemented with antibiotics (20 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin or 50 μg/ml gentamicin).Electrophysiology ExperimentsElectrophysiological recordings were made using a dual electrode voltage clamp (TEC 00, NPI Electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany) as described previously (25Bertrand D. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 146: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Utkin Y.N. Zhmak M.N. Methfessel C. Tsetlin V.I. Toxicon. 1999; 37: 1683-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were placed in a plexiglass chamber, voltage-clamped at −80 mV, and superfused with normal frog Ringer's solution (in mm: NaCl 115, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 10, pH 7.2, adjusted with NaOH). ACh stock solution (0.1 m) was kept frozen and added to the test solutions on the day of the experiment. Cells were treated with WTX by incubating in the measuring chamber with a WTX-containing normal frog Ringer's solution for 20 min with perfusion stopped.RESULTSThe WTX isolated by sequential gel filtration, ion exchange, and reverse-phase chromatography is homogeneous by the criteria of the latter and has a molecular mass of 7613 Da (Fig.1 A). However, this mass is larger than that (7483 Da) calculated from the published sequence of the weak toxin CM-9a from N. kaouthia venom (2Joubert F.J. Taljaard N. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1980; 361: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There are no tryptophan residues in CM-9a, whereas determination of the primary structure of WTX (17Utkin Y.N. Kukhtina V.V. Maslennikov I.V. Eletsky A.V. Starkov V.G. Weise C. Franke P. Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) detected a Trp residue in position 36 and also revealed two other differences from the CM-9a sequence: Lys-50 instead of Tyr and Tyr-52 instead of Lys (17Utkin Y.N. Kukhtina V.V. Maslennikov I.V. Eletsky A.V. Starkov V.G. Weise C. Franke P. Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The molecular mass calculated for this sequence practically coincides with that found experimentally. Therefore, WTX, whose sequence is depicted in Fig. 1 B, can be considered as a new homologue of CM-9a. When tested for a capacity to compete with [125I]αBgt for binding to the membrane-bound T. californica AChR, WTX was found to be about 300 times less potent than CTX and NT-II, the long chain and short chain α-neurotoxins (Fig.2 A and TableI).Figure 2Inhibition of [125I]α Bgt binding to the AChR-enriched membrane preparations of the T. californicaelectric organ (A) and to the solubilized fusion protein GST -α-(1–208) (B) by the snake venom toxins WTX (●), CTX (▪), and NT-II (▴) and by α-conotoxin ImI (▾).

Open table in a new tab In addition to the muscle-type AChRs, the long neurotoxins αBgt and CTX also bind to neuronal α7 AChR. To assess this possibility for WTX as well, we used a bacterially expressed protein containing the N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1–208) of the rat brain α7 receptor preceded by GST. This chimera faithfully reproduces a number of α7 AChR features (Fig. 2 B and Table I). It interacts with αBgt and CTX as well as with the α7-targeting α-conotoxin ImI but practically does not bind either NT-II, a short-chain α-neurotoxin, or α-conotoxin G1 acting on the Torpedoand other muscle-type AChRs. In competition with [125I]αBgt for binding to the chimerical protein, WTX was as active as CTX (Table I).To test whether WTX binding can also lead to a functional block of the native α7 AChRs, electrophysiological investigations on the α7 AChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes were performed. Incubation for 20 min in the presence of 10 μm WTX caused an almost complete block of the subsequent ACh-evoked current (Fig.3 A). Such an inhibitory potency is much weaker than that of CTX or αBgt, which block α7 AChRs in the nanomolar range (13Antil-Delbeke S. Gaillard C. Tamiya T. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. Servent D.

We decided to check whether WTX is closer to αBgt/CTX or to α-conotoxin ImI in the reversibility of its blocking effect on the rat α7 AChR.Figure 3Inhibition of AChRs expressed inXenopus oocytes by WTX and CTX from N. kaouthia snake venom. The currents were evoked by short applications of ACh (50 μm, 4 s) to oocytes before (control) and after 20 min of incubation with toxins. Cells were held throughout the experiments at −80 mV.

It is similar to the slow dissociation of αBgt (29Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar) or CTX (see Ref. 30Wonnacott S. Albuquerque E.X. Bertrand D. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 12: 263-275Google Scholar and Fig.6), whereas α-conotoxin ImI could be washed out almost completely in 10 min.Figure 6Progress of recovery of current responses for several neurotoxins. After 10–20 min of incubation with toxin, cells were again continually superfused with Frog Ringer and challenged with 50 μm ACh for 4-s applications at 5-min intervals to monitor the recovery of the ACh-induced current response.Vertical bars show current signal amplitudes normalized to the amplitude of the initial response of the cell to 50 μm ACh. Black squares indicate 50 μm ACh applications at 5-min intervals. The two upper diagrams correspond to the WTX preparations before and after additional purification (Fig. 4), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In view of the facts that WTX is washed out from oocytes as slowly as CTX but in terms of acting concentrations is about 1000-fold less potent, it was necessary to address the possibility that the effects on α7 AChRs in oocytes ascribed to WTX in fact might have arisen if traces of CTX, even as low as 0.1%, were present in the WTX preparations. Therefore, additional experiments were done to check and, if necessary, to increase the degree of purity of WTX.Fig. 1 A shows only one peak in the mass spectrum of WTX purified by reverse-phase HPLC. No sequences other than that of WTX were detected on Edman degradation (17Utkin Y.N. Kukhtina V.V. Maslennikov I.V. Eletsky A.V. Starkov V.G. Weise C. Franke P. Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analysis of a model 1:1000 mixture of CTX:WTX failed to detect the peak of CTX. Fig. 4shows chromatography of ∼4 μg of CTX (trace 3), which would correspond to the 0.1% content in 4 mg of WTX. It is clear that such a small amount can be reliably detected under the chosen conditions. Fig. 4, trace 1 corresponds to purification of 4.2 mg of WTX from the batch used for structure determination and in the biological activity experiments described above. In addition to the huge peak of WTX itself, several minor peaks (each 0.1% or less) can be distinguished, including one coinciding with the position of CTX.When the pooled fractions of the repurified WTX (eluting between 45 and 65 min) were lyophilized and applied again to the same column (Fig. 4,trace 2), no peak was detected at the position of CTX. Some other minor contaminating peaks were still present, which was not surprising in view of the relatively large amount of WTX applied onto the column and the extremely high sensitivity of UV detection.We checked for the presence of CTX traces in the repurified WTX with the aid of polyclonal antibodies raised against reduced and carboxymethylated CTX. As seen from Fig.5, these antibodies allow the detection of very low concentrations of CTX. Although at high concentrations (>0.01 mg/ml) WTX also reacts with these antibodies, the difference in the affinities makes possible the estimation of the upper limit of putative CTX admixture in the repurified WTX. A virtually complete inhibition of the α7 AChR expressed in oocytes was observed at 20 μm (0.15 mg/ml) repurified WTX (see below, Figs.3 B and 7). As seen from Fig. 5, to this concentration of WTX corresponds an OD of ∼0.16. If we assume that it is only the CTX admixture in WTX that interacts with antibodies, this amount should be as low as ∼8.8 × 10−6 mg/ml (See Fig. 5),i.e. not more than 0.006% of the WTX. Moreover, if there is a slight cross-reactivity of antibodies with WTX, the admixture should be even lower, if present at all.Figure 5Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titration of CTX (●) and WTX (▪). Antibody concentration was 20 nm. [C], toxin concentration (mg/ml). Each point represents data of six independent determinations in two repeats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, immunological data confirmed that after additional purification by ion exchange HPLC, there are no measurable traces of CTX in WTX, at least in the range that would force one to ascribe the biological activity of WTX to CTX admixtures. Some of the binding experiments (Fig. 2) and more detailed studies in oocytes (Figs. 3, 6, and 7) were done with the repurified samples of WTX.Additional purification had no effect on the WTX binding either to theTorpedo membranes or to α7 AChR fusion protein. In Fig. 2the experimental points for the repurified WTX (marked asdiamonds and asterisks) fit the displacement curves obtained with the preparation that did not undergo such a treatment.Electrophysiological experiments on the additionally purified WTX gave similar results as those described above; the WTX concentration required to achieve a virtually complete block was 20 μm(cf. Fig. 3, A and B). It is also seen (Fig. 3 C) that at 20 μm WTX reduces by about 60% the ACh-induced current in the human α7 AChR. In the same concentration range it efficiently blocks the rat muscle AChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 3 D). As mentioned above, long chain α-neurotoxins like αBgt or CTX block the α7 and muscle AChR in the nanomolar range, as illustrated in Fig. 3 E for CTX action on the human α7 AChR.From the washout experiments shown in Fig. 3, A andB, and, in more detail, in Fig. 6, it is clear that additional purification did not affect the virtual irreversibility of the WTX action. In this respect, it is practically indistinguishable from αBgt or CTX and differs greatly from α-conotoxin ImI, which can be washed out in minutes (Fig. 6).Fig. 7 shows the dose-response data illustrating the WTX action on the rat and human α7 AChRs. Accurate quantitative measurements of these blocking effects on oocytes are difficult, especially at low toxin concentrations, because of the long incubation times required for the WTX to manifest its activity. We were able to estimate the IC50 value for the WTX action on the rat α7 AChR as 8.3 μm, whereas for the qualitatively less potent action on human α7 AChR we can give a very rough estimation of the IC50 value as ∼15 μm.Figure 7Concentration dependences for the WTX inhibition of the ACh-activated currents in rat (▪) and human (●) α7 AChRs expressed in Xenopusoocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur initial purpose was to isolate from the N. kaouthiasnake venom a weak toxin, CM-9a, the only weak toxin previously found in this venom (2Joubert F.J.

End sequencing and EMBO/GenBankTM data base analysis showed these clones to be contained in four previously sequenced human bacterial artificial chromosome clones present on chromosome 17q12-21 and arrayed into two large contigs of 290 and 225 kilobase pairs (kb) in size. A fifth, partially sequenced human bacterial artificial chromosome clone data base sequence overlapped and closed both of these contigs.

The other end of this cluster contained the human type I cytokeratin K20 andK12 gene loci. The center of the cluster, starting 35 kb downstream of the hHa3-I hair keratin gene, contained 37 genes for high/ultrahigh sulfur hair keratin-associated proteins (KAPs), which could be divided into a total of 7 KAP multigene families based on amino acid homology comparisons with previously identified sheep, mouse, and rabbit KAPs. To date, 26 human KAP cDNA clones have been isolated through screening of an arrayed human scalp cDNA library by means of specific 3′-noncoding region polymerase chain reaction probes derived from the identified KAP gene sequences.

An external sheath of overlapping flattened cuticle cells, often only a single layer thick, encase the multicellular cortex. In distinct hair fibers there is also a third cell type present in the centrally located medulla. The proliferative cells that give rise to the mature hair fiber reside in the bulb at the base of the follicle. As they leave the germinative compartment, trichocytic differentiation begins, and in matrix, cuticular, and cortical cells, the genes for two families of structural proteins are activated (1Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1997: 59-148Crossref Google Scholar). These families comprise the hair keratins and the hair keratin-associated proteins. The human hair keratin family consists of at least 16 members that are divided into an acidic, type I, and a basic to neutral type II subfamily (2Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Wolf C.

To fulfill their biological function, specific type I and type II hair keratin pairs are sequentially expressed and assembled into 10 nm heteropolymeric keratin intermediate filaments, termed KIFs.1 At the height of the lower to middle cortex, these filaments are embedded into a matrix that is formed by the hair keratin-associated proteins, termed KAPs. Based on amino acid composition, essentially three classes of KAPs have been described, the high sulfur KAPs (<30 mol % cysteine content), the ultrahigh sulfur KAPs (>30 mol % cysteine content), and the high tyrosine/glycine KAPs. Up to now, these three classes have been further subdivided into 15 distinct KAP multigene families, based on amino acid homologies and the nature of their repeat structures. Thus, the KAP1–3 and KAP10–15 families belong to the high sulfur KAPs (1Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair.

The premise that KAP genes are clustered in the mammalian genome has prompted us to screen a human P1 Artificial Chromosome Library (PAC library) using a conserved probe of human KAP1.1A (4Zhumbaeva B.D. Gening L.V. Gazaryan K.G. Mol. Biol. (Moscow). 1992; 26: 550-555Google Scholar). The PAC clones isolated lead to the identification of contiguous DNA sequences in the EMBO/GenBankTM containing 37 genes for high and ultrahigh sulfur KAPs, which could be classified into seven KAP multigene families. cDNA transcripts of 30 KAP genes from these families were isolated from an arrayed human scalp cDNA library.In situ hybridization, using 3′-noncoding region probes from single members of the human KAP1–3, -4, and -9 families showed expression of the respective mRNAs in the differentiated portion of the hair cortex. A 764-bp genomic PCR product of human KAP1.1A (hB2A) (4Zhumbaeva B.D. Gening L.V. Gazaryan K.G. Mol. Biol.

Six clones, termed PAC7–PAC12, were isolated (see Fig. 1).

Screening of a human scalp cDNA library cloned into the λ-ZapII vector was accomplished as described previously (28Rogers M.A. Nischt R. Korge B. Krieg T. Fink T.M. Lichter P. Winter H. Schweizer J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At a later date, arraying of single bacterial phagemid clones into microtiter plates and the preparation of DNA hybridization filters from these single clones were performed. Briefly, a mass in vivoexcision/conversion of the human scalp library was accomplished, converting the λ-library clones into a more manageable Bluescript phagemid form. Dilutions of this excised library (∼6000 clones) were plated onto 22 × 22-cm LB agar plates under ampicillin selection, and single colonies were picked and arrayed into 132-well microtiter dishes using a spotting robot. Approximately 26,000 of the single clones were then double-spotted onto a single, gridded 22 × 22-cm nylon membrane in an ordered fashion. The single colonies were grown on these filters overnight and lysed, and their DNA was cross-linked to the nylon membrane (for further details see the German Resource Center Web site). The arrayed human scalp cDNA library filters were screened using 150–250-bp 3′-noncoding region probes from the putative hair keratin-associated protein genes discovered in the EMBO/GenBankTM data base BAC clones (see Table I). Prehybridization/hybridization was performed using 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS as hybridization buffer at 59 °C overnight. Post-hybridization washes were performed 3 times using 0.5× SSC, 1% SDS at 59 °C for 30 min. The filters were autoradiographed using Kodak XAR5 film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The position of doubly positive clones on the filter was determined using a 5 × 5 scoring pattern, and the coordinates from the scoring pattern were then used to obtain the correct clone from the scalp library (the clones described in TableII are available from the German Resource Center or from the authors).Table IIGenBank™ accession numbers for genomic and cDNA sequences presented in this studyKAP designationGenBank™ accession No. genomic sequencesOpen reading frameStrandcDNA clone designationcDNA accession numberMolecular mass of proteinCysteine residuesDamol %KAP1.1B (KAP1.1A)AC007455 (X63337) 2-aGenBank™ accession numbers of the originally isolated human KAP1 members.

The subcloning of PAC NdeI restriction enzyme fragments has been described previously (2Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Wolf C. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 464-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The subcloning of PAC10 resulted in the isolation of ∼80% of the total NdeI fragments. End sequencing of the isolated NdeI subclones with subsequent EMBO/GenBankTM analysis of these DNA sequences identified many of these sequences on the draft DNA sequence (in progress sequencing) of two BAC clones (accession numbers AC025904 andAC037482). At the time of analysis these clones were 174,032 and 180,944 bp in size and consisted of 17 and 30 fragments, respectively. Comparison of these draft sequences with the subcloned PAC10 sequences allowed a complete orientation of the relevant draft sequences on PAC10. Sequencing of the clones isolated from the arrayed human scalp cDNA library as well as the NdeI subclones from PAC10 were performed by fluorescence dye terminator cycle sequencing using the Big Dye DNA Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Weiterstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions (see also Ref. 3Rogers M.A. Winter H. Wolf C. Heck M. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26683-26691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The sequencing reactions were analyzed on a ABI310 capillary DNA sequencing apparatus using the 47-cm capillary. DNA analysis of PAC, BAC, and cDNA clones was done using the Wisconsin GCG software package (version 10) as contained in the Heidelberg Unix Sequence Analysis Resource. The initial KAP EMBO/GenBankTM data base searches were performed using the BLASTN program. KAP homology searches on individual BAC clones was accomplished using the SIMILARITY program. Multiple KAP protein homology comparison were done using the CLUSTAL program. Repeat structure analysis was performed using the program DOTPLOT. cDNA sequence assembly and correction was accomplished using the STADEN program package. In situ hybridization (ISH) of cryostat sections of human hair follicles containing scalp (taken for medical reasons) were performed as described previously (29Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Praetzel S.

Specific ISH signals were visualized using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Simultaneous visualization of reflected ISH signals through epi-illumination and transmitted light in bright field were combined by overlay using pseudocolors in Figure 8 (transmission image green, electronically changed to black/white; reflection image (ISH signal) shown in red). Screening of an arrayed human PAC library with a full-length probe of the human KAP1.1A gene (4Zhumbaeva B.D. Gening L.V. Gazaryan K.G. Mol. Biol. (Moscow). 1992; 26: 550-555Google Scholar) leads to the isolation of six PAC clones, termed PAC7–12. DNA end sequences derived from each of these clones were compared with sequences in the EMBO/GenBankTM data base, which resulted in the identification of four fully sequenced BAC clones, AC003958, AC006070,AC007455, and AC00423, representing two DNA contigs on chromosome 17q12-21. Contig 1, comprising BAC clones AC00395 and AC006070, covered ∼290 kb, and contig 2, consisting of BAC clones AC007455 and AC00423, was 223 kb in size (Fig. 1). In addition, two partially sequenced BAC clones, AC025904 and AC037482 (not shown in Fig. 1), were also identified.

Biochem. 1989; 180: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggests that these CRs have a 41-residue insertion at a strategic location, before the conserved Tyr-X-X-X-Lys motif. Nearly all SDRs are known to utilize a Tyr-Lys-Ser triad as catalytic residues (1Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The Tyr hydroxyl has been proposed to be the proton donor in an electrophilic attack on the substrate carbonyl in a reduction reaction (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The other distinguishing feature of all SDRs is that the functional units are either homotetramers or homodimers (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M.

Biol. 1998; 282: 383-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the active units of both PTCR and human CR were reported to be monomeric (5Nakajin S. Ohno S. Shinoda M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 104: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Wermuth B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1206-1213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although more than half of the 15 or so crystal structures of SDRs to date exhibit the same tetrameric quaternary structure, only the four-helix bundle or the Q axis interface that involves the largest surface area of association (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) is conserved among SDRs. The other surface of close association of monomers in tetrameric SDRs is the so-called P axis interface involving an anti-parallel pair of strands and a pair of helices (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) that has been observed only once in a dimeric SDR (17Grimm C. Maser E. Möbus E. Klebe G. Reuter K. Ficner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41333-41339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The interfacial four-helix bundle that borders two catalytic sites and buries hydrophobic surfaces of helices is predicted to be important for the integrity of the active site clefts (18Puranen T. Poutanen M. Ghosh D. Vihko P. Vihko R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ghosh D. Vihko P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 639-652Google Scholar). Here we present the first crystal structure of a monomeric SDR and explain how the functional determinants of oligomeric SDRs could be retained within a monomer of PTCR having the basic SDR fold. The enzyme was purified as described (5Nakajin S. Ohno S. Shinoda M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 104: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Crystallization and data collection details have also been published (20Ghosh D. Erman M. Pangborn W. Duax W.L. Nakajin S. Ohno S. Shinoda M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 103-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme was crystallized from a solution of 36–37% saturated ammonium sulfate in 10 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0. Crystals of diffraction size were grown by macroseeding. The space group is P43212 and the unit cell parameters area = b = 58.53 Å and c= 165.64 Å with one molecule (288 amino acid residues) in the asymmetric unit. Data collection was carried out on a Rigaku R axis II image plate detector at ambient temperature and processed with the software package DENZO (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). Data from three crystals between resolution range 55.2 and 2.30 Å were merged to yield a data set of 10792 unique reflections (F > 0) with an average of about three observations per reflection. The overallRmerge was 0.066 on the intensities. The data were 80% complete overall and 52% complete in the resolution shell between 2.50 and 2.30 Å. The structure was solved by the single isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering method, combined with phases from a molecular replacement solution. Two platinum compounds, potassium chloroplatinate (PtCl4) and di-μ-iodobis(ethylenediamine)diplatinum(II) nitrate (PIP), were used to prepare heavy atom derivative crystals, both yielding the same major platinum-binding site. A total of 4351 reflections to 3.00 Å was phased using the PIP derivative, and 3564 reflections to 3.20 Å were phased using the PtCl4 derivative. The latter data set also contained anomalous signal for 1660 reflections to 3.40 Å. The centricR value and the phasing power for the PIP and PtCl4 derivatives were 0.56 and 1.64 and 0.63 and 1.41, respectively. The phasing power for the anomalous data was 1.92. The software package PHASES (22Furey W. Swaminathan S. Abstracts of the American Crystallographic Association Meeting. New Orleans, LA1990: 73Google Scholar) was used for calculating and combining phases. The molecular replacement solution was obtained using a search model, which was a superposition of equally weighted structures of 3α,20β-HSD (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), 17β-HSD1 (9Ghosh D. Pletnev V.Z. Zhu D.-W. Wawrzak Z. Duax W.L. Pangborn W. Labrie F. Lin S.-X.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7715-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A large number of rotation search solutions were computed using compact (without loop regions) and extended (all loops through the catalytic triad present) search models. The optimal solution was obtained with the CNS program suite (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) and the extended search model with data between 15.00 and 3.50 Å, against an E2E2 synthesis. The translation function search was conducted in both P43212 and P41212 space groups. Phases from the most likely solutions were computed and used to phase a difference Fourier synthesis with the PIP derivative and native data to 3.00 Å. The correct translation function solution in the space group P43212 produced the largest peak at the platinum-binding site, having a height about three times the background peaks. The heavy atom hand and the choice of origin were fixed by this peak position. Phases calculated from the model were combined with single isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering phases using the PHASES package. In all, 4698 reflections were phased to 3.00 Å, with a combined figure of merit of 0.809, a correlation coefficient of 0.792, and an Rinverse value of 0.266. Model building was carried out on a Silicon Graphics R10000 Indigo2 work station using a figure of merit weighted Fo map, phased with the combined experimental phases, and the software CHAIN (24Sack J.S.J. J. Mol. Graph. 1988; 6: 224-225Crossref Google Scholar). Initially, 235 of 288 amino acids were fit in the electron density map, which also unequivocally showed the NADP density. The model was subjected to 26 cycles of refinement and rebuilding processes, using XPLOR (25Brünger A. T. X-PLOR, User's Guide, Version 3. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) routines. The resolution was gradually extended to 2.30 Å. The C-terminal tail section was built during the latter part of the refinement. Various omit maps with calculated phases were computed to resolve regions of ambiguity. Except for a few residues in highly exposed regions of the molecule, such as Glu-261, Lys-219, and Lys-238, side chains were in good agreement with their electron densities. A sulfate ion and 58 well ordered water molecules were introduced in the last three cycles of refinement and rebuilding. A summary of refinement results is provided in TableI. The analysis of the molecular geometry was performed with PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Amino acid residues are numbered 1–288 starting with the Ser at position 2 in the cDNA sequence (2Tanaka M. Ohno S. Adachi S. Nakajin S. Shinoda M. Nagahama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13451-13455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A ribbon diagram of the tertiary structure of PTCR is shown in Fig.1 a. A schematic description of the structure is provided in Fig. 1 b. The basic SDR fold includes a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet (βA to βG) flanked by three parallel helices on each side (αB, αC, αG and αD, αE, αF). The segment βA to βF is a doubly wound α/β motif, with alternating β-strands and α-helices. Whereas the βA to βF segment constitutes the classic “Rossmann fold” associated with the binding of the coenzyme NADPH, the βD to βG segment, in addition to being partially within the Rossmann fold, governs quaternary association and substrate binding. The two longest helices αE and αF form the interfacial four-helix bundle, typical of dimeric and tetrameric forms. The view in Fig. 1 a is along the central β-sheet of the PTCR molecule, overlooking the active site delineated by the coenzyme NADP and catalytic residues Tyr-193, Lys-197, and Ser-139. As shown in Fig. 1, a and b, the basic SDR fold described above is well preserved in PTCR, except for two important differences. First, the 41-residue insertion before Tyr-193 describes four helices αF′-1 (residues 140–148), αF′-2 (residues 151–158), αF′-3 (residues 164–179), and αF′-4 (residues 182–186). The first turn of αF′-1 coincides with the helical turn immediately following the catalytic serine (Ser-139 in PTCR) present in nearly all SDRs. This all-helix subdomain folds away from the active site cleft, toward the dimer interface of other SDRs. Second, after a tight turn the polypeptide following βG describes an additional strand βH (residues 272–275) that is anti-parallel to βG. The last 13 C-terminal residues form an extended tail-like structure that approaches the active site of a 2-fold symmetry-related molecule. The terminal carboxyl group forms a salt bridge with the Arg-37 side chain of the second molecule. A similar eighth anti-parallel strand is present only in one other member of the SDR family, dihydropteridine reductase (12Varughese K.I. Skinner M.M. Whiteley J.M. Matthews D.A. Xuong N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6080-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 c is a superposition of monomers of crystal structures of all four steroid dehydrogenases belonging to the SDR superfamily (bacterial 3α,20β-HSD, human 17β-HSD1, Escherichia coli 7α-HSD (14Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7715-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and PTCR). The viewing direction in this figure is roughly the same as in Fig. 1 a. 3α,20β-HSD and 7α-HSD have homotetrameric structures, whereas 17β-HSD1 is homodimeric (Fig. 2). The structural diversity among monomers of all members of the SDR family is well represented by this group. The overlap of the Rossmann fold and the catalytic triad among these four enzymes, excluding the 41-residue insertion in PTCR, is striking. Furthermore, two long helices αE and αF from 3α,20β-HSD, 7α-HSD, and 17β-HSD1 that make up the four-helix bundle dimer interface superimpose remarkably well with the ones from PTCR, which are not involved in dimer formation. The other important observation from this superposition is the diversity of the three-dimensional structures of the regions primarily contributed by the C-terminal halves of polypeptide chains. This region, which constitutes the outer walls of the substrate-binding cleft of the active site, provides specific interactions that are critical to the selectivity of substrates and to the mechanism of molecular recognition by the enzyme (19Ghosh D. Vihko P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 639-652Google Scholar, 29Sawicki M.W. Erman M. Puranen T. Vihko P. Ghosh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although this region is well developed for 17β-HSD1 having additional structural elements from an insertion between βF and αG, and from an extended C terminus that surrounds the catalytic cleft, fewer residues from similar regions of 3α,20β-HSD and 7α-HSD are present in the area. In 3α,20β-HSD, a segment of the polypeptide chain from the loop between βF and αG (Met-184 to Pro-206) and C-terminal residues Trp-243 to Gln-255 border the active site cleft (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Similarly, in 7α-HSD, residues Ala-191 to Pro-214 between βF and αG and C-terminal residues Gly-250 to Asn-255 line the active site (14Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7715-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus, the outer wall structures in 3α,20β-HSD and 7α-HSD differ significantly from that of 17β-HSD1. These differences in the architecture of active sites probably explain why 17β-HSD1 has high specificity for estrone as a substrate, whereas the other two enzymes are not known to be substrate-specific. Nonetheless, all three enzymes possess the so-called substrate entry-loop between βF and αG, which tightens on the substrate upon its entry into the active site providing additional substrate-specific interactions (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7715-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Ghosh D. Vihko P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 639-652Google Scholar, 29Sawicki M.W. Erman M. Puranen T. Vihko P. Ghosh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The entrance to the active site in PTCR is more open than any other HSD. This is a direct consequence of a shortened three-residue linkage between βF and αG, connecting Gly-236 and Pro-240 (corresponding to residues Thr-190 and Val 210, respectively, in 3α,20β-HSD). Consequently, the substrate-entry loop is almost non-existent in PTCR. Moreover, only residues Glu-281 to Ala-288 from the C-terminal tail are in the vicinity of the active site. The number of residues that border the substrate-binding cleft is thus only 15 in PTCR, as opposed to 37 in 3α,20β-HSD, 30 in 7α-HSD, and 60 in 17β-HSD1. The openness of the substrate-binding cleft is consistent with the observed promiscuity in substrate specificity of PTCR. The Lys-238 side chain in human placental CR is autocatalytically modified to carboxyethyllysine (30Krook M. Ghosh D. Strömberg R. Carlquist M. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This side chain in PTCR is in a highly exposed region, and its electron density is not discernible beyond the Cδ atom owing probably to dynamic disorders. The Q axis dimer interface involving the four-helix bundle and the P axis interface involving anti-parallel association of βG strands and αG helices in the prototypical tetrameric 3α,20β-HSD are shown in Fig. 2, a and b. The four-helix bundle, conserved in dimeric SDRs such as 17β-HSD1 shown in Fig.2 c, conceals most of the hydrophobic surfaces that are at dimer interfaces (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Efforts to disrupt the Q axis interface by mutations resulted in inactive and insoluble monomers (18Puranen T. Poutanen M. Ghosh D. Vihko P. Vihko R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the four-helix bundle is considered critical to function, since disruption of the helical bundle interferes with the integrity of the two active sites it borders, as shown in Fig. 2, a andc. The P axis interface does not involve significant hydrophobic interactions (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and is less critical to the structural integrity of the active site. The all-helix subdomain of the 41-amino acid insertion region obstructs access to αE and αF. Helices αF′-1 and αF′-2 and the Trp-276 side chain from the C-terminal end of the new strand βH surround αF such that four of its seven turns are shielded from solvent exposure. The four and a half turn helix αF′-3, the longest in the subdomain, partially shields αF and packs over five of the seven turns of αE, as shown in Fig. 2 d. Together, αF′-2, αF′-3, and αF′-4 occupy the position of symmetry-related helices αE and αF in 3α,20β-HSD, 17β-HSD1, and 7α-HSD, blocking the interface and preventing dimer formation. However, as shown in a close-up view of the area in Fig. 2 d, this arrangement does not completely shield the interface leaving αE and αF partially exposed. Selective substitutions of residues on these helices in PTCR render the exposed surface more hydrophilic than in oligomeric SDRs, as shown in Fig.2 d (substitutions from 3α,20β-HSD to PTCR are as follows: Phe-116 to Arg-118, Thr-121 to Glu-123, Val-168 to Arg-209, Gly-171 to Arg-212, and Thr-172 to Glu-213). All four helices of the insertion domain are amphipathic; their hydrophobic surfaces face the outer hydrophobic surfaces of αE and αF, and their hydrophilic surfaces are exposed to the solvent, as shown for αF′-3 in Fig.2 d. Interestingly, the inner hydrophobic surface of αF′-3 contains Met-171 which packs against Met-110, in close proximity to the Met-115 side chain, both from αE. The Sδ atom of Met-171 is at a distance of 3.76 Å from Sδ of Met-110, which is 6.04 Å from Sδ of Met-115. This partially exposed “methionine trap” is responsible for the high affinity binding of platinum ions (mono- and di-platinate) to the crystalline protein that resulted in the only useful isomorphous derivatives for solving the phase problem (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Although no coenzyme was added in the crystallization medium, a molecule of NADP(H) was bound to the protein molecule. The coenzyme is in the extended conformation as observed for all other NAD(P)(H) bound to SDRs (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M.

A. 1999; 96: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The distance between C-2 of the nicotinamide and C-6 of the adenine ring, a parameter used to compare the degree of extension of coenzymes, is 14.65 Å, well within the range for SDRs. The nicotinamide ring is in syn conformation, with the 4-pro-S hydride facing the catalytic site, typical of all SDRs. The coenzyme molecule and its electron density are shown in Fig.3 a, along with side chains in the vicinity. Puckering of the nicotinamide ring was not discernible at the working resolution, and we used parameters of an oxidized coenzyme to restrain its geometry during refinement. Hydrogen bonding and charge interactions between NADPH and neighboring amino acid residues are drawn schematically in Fig. 3 b. The high specificity of the enzyme for reduced β-NADPH has been established. At pH 7, PTCR has the highest affinity for β-NADPH as evidenced by the lowest Km of 7.2 μmand the highest Vmax/Km ratio of 16.2 nmol min−1mg−1μm−1 of all coenzymes (6Ohno S. Nakajin S. Shinoda M.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 38: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, we find that the negatively charged 2′-phosphate moiety is surrounded by three positively charged side chains (Arg-37, Arg-41, and Lys-14), one hydrogen bond forming polar side chain (Asn-13), and a water molecule. All of these make specific contacts with the 2′-phosphate group, either through hydrogen bond formation or electrostatic charge neutralization, as shown in Fig. 3. The Asn-13 side chain carbonyl also accepts a proton from the 3′-hydroxyl of the adenine ribose. In addition to the presence of charged Arg and Lys residues near the 2′-phosphate of NADPH noted before (13Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Hara A. Mitsui Y. Structure. 1996; 4: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Sawicki M.W. Erman M. Puranen T. Vihko P. Ghosh D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), specific interactions of the Asn-13 side chain with phosphate and ribose groups may play an important role in coenzyme selectivity. The location of Asp-62 near the amide group of the adenine ring is analogous to the Asp-60 in 3α,20β-HSD (8Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M.

The carboxamide group of the nicotinamide ring interacts with the main chain atoms of Val-230, whereas the Thr-232 side chain makes a hydrogen bond with the bridging pyrophosphate. Interestingly, a sulfhydryl group from Met-234 is also present in the general vicinity, as has been observed in other SDR structures (Met-189 in 3α,20β-HSD and Met-193 in 17β-HSD1). Two water molecules are hydrogen-bonded to the phosphates. Catalytic side chains Tyr-193 and Lys-197 and the main chain carbonyl group of Asn-89 have contacts with the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyls of the nicotinamide ribose moiety, as shown in Fig. 3. Not shown in the figure is a short contact (3.1 Å) between the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly-228 of PTCR, conserved in all steroid dehydrogenases and many other SDRs, and C-4 of the nicotinamide ring. This interaction and the orientation of carbonyl with respect to the nicotinamide ring have been proposed to have an important role in driving the hydride transfer from the coenzyme to the substrate (19Ghosh D. Vihko P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 639-652Google Scholar). The most interesting intermolecular interaction among crystallographically related monomers of PTCR is the formation of a crystallographic dimer by the packing of two loops between βD and αE (Ile-92 to Pro-101) about a 2-fold rotation axis. Because of the openness of the active site cleft, the loops penetrate each other's active site and the Asp-97 side chain from one loop makes two strong hydrogen bonds to the catalytic residues Tyr-193 and Ser-139 (2.57 and 2.58 Å, respectively) of the other molecule, as shown in Fig. 4 a. Interaction of the hydroxyl group of the catalytic Tyr with a carboxyl acid group was previously observed in the structure of the carbenoxolone complex of 3α,20β-HSD (31Ghosh D. Erman M. Wawrzak Z. Duax W.L. Pangborn W. Structure. 1994; 2: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in which the hemisuccinate side chain of the inhibitor formed a strong hydrogen bond with the Tyr-152 hydroxyl. The main chain amide of Asp-97 makes a hydrogen bond (2.96 Å) with Glu-141 Oε2 from a symmetry-related molecule. The 2-fold rotation axis passes through the center of two Gln-95 side chains, whose Oε1 atoms are 3.48 Å apart and make hydrogen bonds (2.84 Å) with the main chain amides of Leu-96s of symmetry-related molecules. The Leu-96 side chain stacks against the Ala-93 and Tyr-193 side chains, and Asn-98 side chain stacks against the Trp-229 side chain. The conformation of this loop is considerably different in PTCR than in other SDRs (Fig. 4 b). The similarity of the conformations of the loops in 3α,20β-HSD, 17β-HSD1, and 7α-HSD is characterized by the presence of a distorted 310 helical turn (residues 95–99 in 3α,20β-HSD, 98–102 in 17β-HSD1, and 103–106 in 7α-HSD), which is absent in PTCR. The loop adopts an extended conformation in PTCR. The distances between Cα-99 and the equivalent Cα-95 in 3α,20β-HSD, Cα-98 in 17β-HSD1, and Cα-103 in 7α-HSD are 12.02, 9.33, and 8.59 Å, respectively. It is not clear whether this difference in conformation of the loop results from the interaction of the Asp-97 side chain with catalytic residues or if this altered conformation leads to dimerization. The other interesting aspect of this packing interaction is the formation of a salt bridge between the free C-terminal of one molecule and the Arg-37 side chain of the other, as shown in Fig. 4 c.This is the same Arg side chain that is involved in a specific interaction with the 2′-phosphate group of the coenzyme. Furthermore, the extended loop described above (residues 92–101) approaches the tail region of the symmetry-related monomer, producing the following intermolecular stacking interactions among side chains: Ile-92 with Ala-288, Phe-94 with Val-286, and Ala-288, Pro-99 with Pro-284, and Pro-101 with Tyr-283. Thus the two most extended and isolated regions of the PTCR molecule are stabilized in the crystal by intermolecular interactions with the same regions of a symmetry-related molecule. Such contacts between two molecules can only be present in the crystal, as the functional unit of PTCR was shown to be a monomer in solution from the gel filtration data (5Nakajin S. Ohno S. Shinoda M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 104: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Previously determined structures of oligomeric SDRs demonstrated how multiple copies of polypeptides could be assembled to build functional enzymes with multiple independent active sites. When allosterism or co-operativity is not required for function, multimeric assembly may not be an efficient utilization of biological resources. The PTCR structure demonstrates how alteration of the protein by substitution and insertion can alleviate the problem of interdependence among protein products, leading to efficient scaffolding of one fully functional active site within an independent molecule. It is possible that monomeric SDRs like PTCR have appeared later in the evolutionary pathway than their oligomeric counterparts."

To study the expression and activity of the human ABCA1 gene in vivo we have examined mice containing two human BAC transgenes with different 5′ ends. Mice containing a 255-kilobase (kb) BAC transgene, including 70 kb upstream of the previously defined exon 1, demonstrated a pattern of tissue-specific expression mimicking that of the endogenous mouse gene. Compared with macrophages from control mice, macrophages from these transgenics had increases in apoA-I cholesterol efflux heightened in response to increases in cell cholesterol content. The observed increase in macrophage apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux was not accompanied by alterations in plasma high density lipoprotein in the transgenics. Although mice containing a smaller 171-kb human BAC transgene, lacking the previously described exon 1 andABCA1 promoter, did not express human ABCA1 in macrophages, they did express the human transgene in liver at levels comparable with those of the orthologous mouse gene. Analysis by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends of liver mRNA from these animals revealed a new ABCA1 exon 1 (exon 1A) and a previously unrecognized promoter. Analysis of human tissue revealed that exon 1A containing transcripts accounted for a high proportion of the ABCA1 mRNAs present in human liver. This analysis of ABCA1 transgenics showed that the expression of human ABCA1 transgenes can result in increased cholesterol efflux from macrophages, unaccompanied by changes in plasma high density lipoprotein, and identified a new ABCA1promoter in humans.

Accordingly, we have examined transgenic mice with two different human ABCA1-containing BAC transgenes. The mice with the human ABCA1 transgene with more human 5′ DNA demonstrated largely appropriated regulation of the human ABCA1 transgene. Surprisingly, the increased cholesterol efflux in macrophages was not accompanied by changes in plasma HDL levels. Analysis of the mice with a 5′ truncated ABCA1 transgene led to the discovery of a new ABCA1 promoter and alternatively spliced transcript that is present at high levels in the livers of humans. The ABC1 transgenics examined in this study were created and maintained in a pure FVB background as described previously (28Qiu, Y., Cavelier, L., Chiu, S., Rubin, E. M., and Cheng, J.-F. (2001) Genomics, in press.Google Scholar). The structure of the two BAC transgenes analyzed in this study is depicted in Fig. 1. Both BAC1 and BAC2 encode the complete ABCA1 protein including the ATG methionine initiation site present in exon 2. The 255-kb BAC1 comprises the entire structural gene plus 70 kb of DNA upstream of the 5′ initiation start site and at least 35 kb of DNA downstream of the polyadenylation signal. The 171-kb BAC2 lacks exon 1 and the 5′ initiation site and contains 13 kb of DNA upstream of exon 2 and ∼35 kb downstream of the polyadenylation signal. Studies of gene expression, cholesterol efflux, and plasma HDL were performed on at least two lines of BAC1 and BAC2 transgenic mice. Mice were fed either Purina Mouse Chow (no. 5001) or a Western-type diet with 1.5 g/kg of cholesterol (Harlan Teklad, TD 88137) for 2 and 4 weeks. Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast, and HDL cholesterol was measured by standard methods described previously (29Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M.

Total murine RNAs from lung, liver, spleen, proximal, medial, and distal small intestine, and testis were extracted using the TRIZOL method (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog no. 15596). Total RNA from human tissues including liver, heart, lung, kidney, adrenal, intestine, brain, and testis was purchased from CLONTECH. Reverse transcriptions were performed using 5 μg of total RNA, random hexamers (New England Biolabs), and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 60 min. The amount of cDNA generated was measured using the TaqMan Syber-green quantitative PCR assay with a 7700 ABI PRISM sequence detector system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primer pairs used to detect the mouse endogenous Abca1 gene (mouse exons 2F and 4R), the human ABCA1 transgene (exons 3F and 4R), the human exon 1A transcript (exons 1AF and 2R), and the human exon 1 transcript (exons 1F and 2R) are listed in Table I. The relative amount of ABCA1 transcript was normalized to 18 S RNA amplification values retrieved from the same sample. The control 18 S RNA used to correct for the total RNA amounts in each sample was purchased from Ambion, and a ratio of 0.8:1.2 for primers/competimers was used for all the samples. PCR was performed with an initial hot start of 3 min at 94 °C followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s.Table IPrimers used in the TaqMan system and 5′ RACE PCRsPrimer nameSequence (5′–3′)Exon 1FGGAGAAAGAGACGCAAACACAExon 2RAGCGGCCAGAGCTCACAGExon 1AFTCCACAGTAGAACACAGTTGAACAExon 3FCAAACATGTCAGCTGTTACTGGAAGExon 4RGAGCCTCCCCAGGAGTCGMouse exon 2FCATTAAGGACATGCACAAGGTCCMouse exon 4RCAGAAAATCCTGCAGCTTCAATTT Open table in a new tab Control and transgenic mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 ml of thioglycolate solution.

The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 rpm and recovered in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS. One million cells/well were plated on 24-well plates. The cells were allowed to attach to the plates for 4 h and were then washed with RPMI 1640 medium with 1% FBS. Peritoneal macrophages were labeled with 1 μCi/ml/well of 3H-cholesterol (48 Ci/mmol) for 24 h. At the same time, cells were incubated with 0.3 mm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine-3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), 50 μg of protein/ml of acetylated LDL, or 1% FBS. Prior to cholesterol efflux measurements, cells were equilibrated (30 min at 37 °C) with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in RPMI 1640 medium followed by brief rinses with serum-free RPMI. Cells were exposed to 25 μg/ml lipid-free human apoA-I for 2, 4, 8, 14, and 22 h. Medium recovered from cells was centrifuged (2,000 ×g, 10 min) to remove cellular debris, and the supernatant was used to measure 3H-cholesterol in the medium. Cell lipids were extracted using isopropanol, and efflux results were expressed as a percentage of the initial cellular 3H appearing in the medium at each time point. 5′ RACE was performed to determine the 5′ end of the human ABCA1 transgene expressed in mouse liver. Total RNAs from the liver tissue of the BAC2 transgenic mouse were extracted using the TRIZOL method (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 60 min. An aliquot of the first strand cDNA was then amplified using a human ABCA1-specific primer, exon 4R (TableI), and a universal primer (CLONTECH). PCR was performed with 40 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel eletrophoresis and cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) using conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Twenty-four single colonies were picked and sequenced from both ends using the ABI Prism BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, CA) with a 377 automated DNA-sequencing instrument (Applied Biosystems Division). The tissue expression patterns of two human ABCA1 transgenes have been reported by Qiu et al. (28Qiu, Y., Cavelier, L., Chiu, S., Rubin, E. M., and Cheng, J.-F.

We have examined several additional tissues (Fig. 2 A), and the results support the theory that BAC1 contains the DNA necessary for appropriate tissue-specific expression of ABCA1. BAC2 contains the entire coding sequence of human ABCA1 and 13 kb upstream of exon 2 (Fig.1). Although this transgene lacks the previously described promoter (20Santamarina-Fojo S. Peterson K.

The BAC1 transgene was expressed in peritoneal macrophages and induced by acetylated LDL in the same manner as the endogenous mouse gene (Fig. 3). The response to cAMP treatment was different for the human transgene and the endogenous mouse gene. The human transgene was down-regulated by the cAMP treatment, whereas the endogenous mouse gene was highly induced (Fig. 3). This may reflect differences in the kinetics of the response between the human and mouse ABCA1 genes in peritoneal macrophages. The response of ABCA1 to cAMP has previously been reported to differ between mouse and human cells, with mouse cells showing a high and immediate cAMP induction and human cells showing no induction or requiring a longer cAMP incubation time (17Bortnick A.E.

To address the question of whether the expression of the human transgene confers functional activity, we measured the efflux of cholesterol to apoA-I using peritoneal macrophages from BAC1 and control mice. Apolipoprotein-mediated efflux was ∼2-fold greater in macrophages expressing the human ABCA1 transgene compared with controls (Fig. 4 A). Macrophages from the transgenic and control mice responded similarly to acetylated LDL exposures with nearly 4-fold increases in efflux compared with the nonexposure cholesterol efflux levels (Fig. 4 B). These findings are consistent with an up-regulation of ABCA1 gene expression with cholesterol loading of macrophages and demonstrate the human transgene mimicking the response of the endogenous mouse transporter. The background for investigating the effect of the increased ABCA1 expression on plasma HDL in the transgenics were studies demonstrating that decreased activity of ABCA1 results in dramatic reductions in plasma HDL in mice (25Christiansen-Weber T.A.

The effect of the increased cholesterol efflux noted in isolated macrophages from the BAC1 transgenic mice on plasma HDL in these animals was assessed. Plasma HDL cholesterol in transgenic and control mice on Mouse Chow and Western diet was measured, and no significant differences were noted on either diet (Fig.5). To map the transcription start site of the liver transcript, we performed 5′ RACE on the total liver RNA extracted from the BAC2 transgenics. The sequence of the 5′ RACE product revealed a transcript with an alternative exon 1 and correctly spliced exons 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 6 A). This newly discovered exon, named exon 1A, is located 2,210 base pairs upstream of exon 2. The exon 1A is 136 base pairs in length (Fig.6 B). A comparison of the sequence of exon 1A with the genomic sequence identified a conserved 5′ splice site located adjacent to this exon. Moreover, the sequence contains the classical TATA box and a CAAT site upstream of the initiation site, suggesting that it may be part of the promoter responsible for the transcriptional control of exon 1A (Fig.6 B). Transfac searches (31Heinemeyer T. Chen X. Karas H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Liebich I. Meinhardt T. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and visual analysis of the promoter region have detected the presence of possible binding sites for several sterol-sensing nuclear receptors including LXRs, steroid and xenobiotic receptor, liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1), and hepatic nuclear factor-3 (Fig. 6 B). These receptors have been shown to mediate transcriptional regulation of many genes implicated in cholestererol homeostasis including the ABCA1gene (32Schoonjans K. Brendel C. Mangelsdorf D. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although these DNA motifs have not been proven to interact with the transcription factors, they are likely targets for studying the regulatory function of ABCA1 in liver and testis. In the BAC1 transgenics, both exon 1 and exon 1A transcripts are present in all tissues with the highest exon 1A expression level in the liver (data not shown). The observation that BAC1 transgenic mice express both exon 1 and exon 1A transcripts suggested that exon 1A may not be a cryptic start site. To determine whether the exon 1A transcripts are present in human tissues and to examine their potential physiological relevance, we investigated the expression of exons 1 and 1A in several human tissues (Fig. 7). Exon 1A was found to be very abundant in human liver, whereas the exon 1 transcripts were found to be more abundant in other peripheral tissues such as lung or adrenals. These results indicate that exon 1A occurs naturally in human tissues and is the predominant ABCA1 transcript in liver. The expression pattern of the BAC1 transgene, including 70 kb of DNA upstream of exon 1, suggests that this human transgene likely contains many of the necessary sequences required for the proper regulation of ABCA1 in vivo. Although the observation that expression of this transgene was associated with increased apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux in peritoneal macrophages was predicted, the finding that this was not associated with changes in plasma HDL on two different diets was surprising. An increase in plasma HDL was expected given the fact that both human and mice with decreased ABCA1 expression have decreased HDL values (8Assman G. von Eckardstein A. Brewer H.B. Scriver C.R.

Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). One of the many possible explanations for the lack of changes in plasma HDL in the ABCA1 transgenics is that the increased efflux in these animals may be too low to impact plasma HDL. Induction of theABCA1 gene by rexinoids, which results in enormous increases in ABCA1 expression in macrophages, is associated with only moderate increases in plasma HDL cholesterol levels (19Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Another explanation for the absence of measurable increases in plasma HDL in BAC1 transgenics relates to the fact that plasma HDL only measures the steady-state level of this lipoprotein in plasma. The ABCA1 transgene may also affect HDL catabolism downstream of the efflux process, possibly in the liver, where it might compensate for the increased efflux occurring at peripheral tissue caused by increased ABCA1 expression. Finally, it can be hypothesized that there are other limiting parameters necessary for HDL formation such as apoA-I, which is not concomitantly up-regulated upon ABCA1 over-expression. Through the analysis of higher expressing ABCA1 transgenics and the crossing of ABCA1 and apoA-I transgenics coupled with more in-depth metabolic studies should help elucidate the relationship between increased expression of ABCA1 and plasma HDL levels. A surprising result of this study was the expression of the smaller human BAC2 transgene in liver and testis despite the absence of the previously defined ABCA1 promoter (20Santamarina-Fojo S. Peterson K. Knapper C. Qiu Y. Freeman L. Cheng J.F. Osorio J. Remaley A. Yang X.P. Haudenschild C. Prades C. Chimini G. Blackmon E. Francois T. Duverger N. Rubin E.M. Rosier M. Denefle P. Fredrickson D.S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The 5′ RACE analysis of liver RNA from animals expressing this transgene identified a new ABCA1 exon (exon 1A) preceded by a sequence containing the hallmarks of a classical promoter. This new transcriptional start giving rise to a properly spliced alternative variant was noted to be the predominant ABCA1 form in human liver, supporting the physiological relevance of this transcript. Other alternatively spliced variants have been detected previously in HepG2 cells (21Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), but they do not correspond to the exon 1A variant identified in the present study; and although they change the amino acid sequence of the protein, their function has not been further characterized. The ABCA1 liver variant described in the present study has a different 5′ untranslated region but no alterations in its protein sequence. This variant ABCA1 may confer a new level of regulation to the gene either at the transcriptional level, through the use of an alternate promoter, or the translational level, with the new 5′ untranslated region possibly affecting the intracellular site and efficiency of ABCA1 translation. Several features of the newly identified exon 1A transcription variant suggest that it may contribute to tissue-specific control of ABCA1 expression. This includes the detection of possible LXR/RXR and LRH-1/steroidogenic factor-1 binding sites at the 5′-flanking region of exon 1A. LXRs are ligand-activated transcription factors that mediate the regulation of several genes implicated in cholesterol homeostasis (32Schoonjans K. Brendel C. Mangelsdorf D. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). LRH-1 is a monomeric nuclear receptor that functions as a tissue-specific transcription factor and acts as a competence factor mediating the liver-specific regulation of the cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase gene by LXRα (34Lu T.T.

A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Steroidogenic factor-1 has DNA binding requirements similar to LRH-1 and controls the oxysterol-mediated transactivation of genes involved in steroidogenesis and gonad development (37Lala D. Syka P. Lazrchik S. Mangelsdorf D. Parker K. Heyman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The presence of these DNA motifs in the 5′-flanking region of exon 1A can potentially account for the expression of BAC2 in liver and testis. The putative exon 1A promoter might allow for an alternate regulation of ABCA1 by liver-specific by-products of cholesterol catabolism and in that way contribute to the coordinate regulation of ABCA1 in the different steps of reverse cholesterol transport. Modification of HDL metabolism has long been considered a target for therapeutic interventions in the prevention of atherogenesis (for a recent review, see Ref. 38von Eckardstein A. Assmann G. Curr.

The results of the present analysis of the in vivo effects of the human ABCA1 transgene illustrate the complexity of ABCA1 regulation and its impact on HDL formation and metabolism. Analysis of the atherogenesis susceptibility of these BAC transgenics with increases in cholesterol efflux unaccompanied by measurable changes in plasma HDL cholesterol should provide important insights into the utility of altering the expression of ABCA1 expression on atherogenesis.

Some receptors preferentially couple to one G-protein, but in the presence of higher, non-physiological concentrations of agonist or in, for example reconstitution assays, these receptors are able to couple to other G-proteins (1Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Brandon S. Bourne H.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5730-5734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sautel M. Milligan G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Other more promiscuous receptors couple functionally to more than one G-protein in the physiological range of agonist concentration (3Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 4Herrlich A. Kuhn B. Grosse R. Schmid A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2437-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the neurokinin NK1 receptor is coupled to two different signaling pathways: a Gαqpathway, which activates phospholipase C β, thereby initiating inositol phosphate formation and a Gαs pathway, which induces cAMP formation. Both effector systems are activated by nanomolar physiological concentrations of substance P (6Nakajima Y. Tsuchida K. Negishi M. Ito S. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2437-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other endogenous neurokinin peptides such as NKA and NKB as well as artificial peptide ligands such as septide can act as high affinity agonists on the NK1 receptor (7Maggi C.A. Schwartz T.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in whole cell binding experiments, the NK1 receptor displays certain characteristics that indicate that the receptor in the cell membrane occurs in more than one high affinity active molecular form. First, competition binding experiments using the agonist substance P as a tracer reveal two-component binding curves for all agonists, indicating the occurrence of two different high affinity binding sites, as opposed to a third low affinity state corresponding to the G-protein-uncoupled receptor as demonstrated by use of antagonist tracers or GTP analogs (8Cascieri M.A. Ber E.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) Second, in competition binding experiments, NKA, NKB, and other so-called septide-like agonists compete for binding against radioactively labeled substance P with surprisingly low apparent affinity. This is in contrast to the nanomolar affinity for these agonists as revealed in either homologous binding experiments or in signal transduction assays. In other words, there are major differences in the affinity for different agonists determined in homologous binding experiments as opposed to heterologous binding experiments against another agonist (7Maggi C.A. Schwartz T.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The two proposed bindings modes of the NK1 receptor have recently been characterized by the use of a number of synthetic analogs of substance P containing a conformationally constrained methionine analog (10Sagan S. Karoyan P. Chassaing G. Lavielle S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23770-23776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the two high affinity agonist binding modes remains to be characterized. Because the first fusion protein between a 7TM receptor and a G-protein was constructed in 1994 by Marullo and co-workers (11Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), such constructs have proven useful in addressing many different types of questions related to receptor function. For example, important information has been gained concerning ligand efficacy, intrinsic activity, kinetics of the receptor G-protein interaction, and the importance of post-translational acylation (12Wise A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24673-24678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Waldhoer M. Wise A. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31014-31019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The improved accessibility for the G-protein during receptor binding was originally expected to increase the proportion of receptors stabilized in the G-protein-coupled high affinity state. But, as recently reviewed by Seifert et al. (16Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Kobilka B.K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), it is clear that a situation with 100% active receptor conformations is not obtained in classical receptor G-protein fusions. For many receptors it has been shown that fusion to the appropriate G-protein does induce high constitutive signaling activity. However, for other receptors this has not been the case, not even with a closer interaction between the receptor and the G-protein as has been achieved through shortening of the tail (17Small K.M. Forbes S.L. Rahman F.F. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Unson C.G. Wu C.R. Sakmar T.P. Merrifield R.B. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 334: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it could be argued that although the receptor and the G-protein are covalently coupled in these fusion proteins, the often rather long tail of the receptor in fact still makes it possible for the receptor to interact rather freely with other G proteins that are highly abundant in the cell, and for which the receptor may have rather high affinity (20Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the present study we have constructed fusion proteins between the NK1 receptor and Gαq or Gαs, respectively; and we have truncated the C-terminal tail of the receptor in an attempt to enable the receptor to preferentially interact with the G-protein it has been covalently coupled to, i.e. to try to exclude interactions with other endogenous G-proteins (Fig. 1). These tail-truncated fusion proteins give clear molecular phenotypes with respect to coupling and especially the agonist binding profile corresponding closely to each of the two high affinity states of the receptor. The fact that the two high affinity binding states for peptide agonists correspond to two different active conformations in complex with respectively Gαs and Gαq was supported by an observed total decoupling from Gαs in a mutant NK1 receptor that closely mimicked the tail-truncated Gαq fusion protein. Substance P and neurokinin A were purchased from Peninsula (Belmont, CA). The cDNA coding for the long splice version of rat Gαs was kindly provided by Dr. Din, and the cDNA for human Gαq was a gift from Dr. Bruce Conklin. The fusion proteins with the wild-type human NK1 receptor were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, with oligonucleotides consisting of 10–15 base pair overlap both from the N terminus of the G-protein and from the most C-terminal part of the receptor and the 72 amino acid-truncated C-terminal receptor in the case of the NK1·Gq and the NK1·Gq-Δtail and NK1·Gs-Δtail, respectively. The cDNAs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pTEJ8. All constructs were verified by restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequencing (ALFexpress DNA sequencer, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 125I-Bolton-Hunter (125I-BH)-labeled substance P was prepared using125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent (IBM5861) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfont, UK) and purified by reverse phase HPLC as previously reported (22Gether U. Johansen T.E. Snider R.M. Lowe III J.A. Nakanishi S. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1993; 362: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).125I-NKA labeled at His1 to a specific activity of 2000 Ci/mmol was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (IBM168). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1885 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with chloroquine addition as previously described (23Gether U. Johansen T.E. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7893-7898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected COS-7 cells were transferred to culture plates 1 day after transfection at a density of 1–50 × 104 cells per well for the wild-type receptor and the NK1·Gq and NK1·Gq-Δtail constructs aiming at 5–8% binding of the various radioactive ligands. However, in the case of the NK1·Gq-Δtail and the [F111S]NK1 constructs and using 125I-NKA as radioligand, 1 × 106 cells/well had to be employed to detect and characterize the binding. Two days after transfection, competition binding experiments were performed for 3 h at 4 °C using 25 pm of the radioiodinated peptides. Binding assays were performed in 0.5 ml of a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMnCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 40 g/ml bacitracin. Nonspecific binding was determined as the binding in the presence of 1 m of the corresponding unlabeled ligand. Cells were washed twice in 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer, and 0.5–1 ml of lysis buffer (8 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40 in 3 macetic acid) was added, and the bound radioactivity was counted. Determinations were made in duplicate. Initial experiments showed that steady-state binding was reached with the various radioactive ligands under these conditions. One day after transfection, COS-7 cells were incubated for 24 h with 5 μCi of [3H]myo-inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, PT6-271) in 1 ml of medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin per well. Cells were washed twice in buffer, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum and were incubated in 0.5 ml of buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 30 min. After stimulation with various concentrations of peptide for 45 min at 37 °C, cells were extracted with 10% ice-cold perchloric acid followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The resulting supernatants were neutralized with KOH in HEPES buffer and the generated [3H]inositol phosphate was purified on Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin as described (24Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvin R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Determinations were made in duplicates. The number of cells used for these experiments were identical to those used for binding experiments, i.e.adjusted to obtain between 5 and 8% binding of the relevant peptide agonist. One day after transfection, COS-7 cells (0.5–10 × 105 cells per well) were incubated for 24 h with 2 μCi of [3H]adenine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, TRK 311) in 1 ml of Dulbecco's 1885 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin. Cells were washed twice and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of freshly prepared binding buffer supplemented with 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma, I5879), 40 μg/ml bacitracin, and with various concentrations of peptides or with 50 μM forskolin. After incubation, cells were placed on ice, medium was removed, and cells were lysed with 1 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, supplemented with 0.1 mm cAMP and 0.1 mmATP for 30 min. The lysis mixtures were loaded onto a Dowex 50W-X4 (Bio-Rad, 142-1351) column (Bio-Rad, poly-prep columns, 731-1550), which was washed with 2 ml of water and placed on top of alumina columns (Sigma, A9003) and washed again with 10 ml of water. The columns were eluted with 6 ml of 0.1 m imidazole (Sigma, I0125) into 15 ml of scintillation fluid (Highsafe III). Columns were re-used up to 10 times. Dowex columns were regenerated by adding 10 ml of 2 n HCl followed by 10 ml of water; the alumina columns by adding 2 ml of 1 m imidazole, 10 ml of 0.1 mimidazole and finally 5 ml of water. Determinations were made in triplicates. The number of cells used for these experiments were identical to those used for binding experiments, i.e.adjusted to obtain between 5 and 8% binding of the relevant peptide agonist. IC50 and EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression using the Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Values of the dissociation and inhibition constants (Kd and Ki) were estimated from competition binding experiments using the equationsKd = IC50 − L andKi = IC50/(1 +L/Kd), where L is the concentration of radioactive ligand. To try to confine the NK1 receptor to interact exclusively with one species of G-proteins, in this case Gαq and not Gαs, two fusion proteins were made between the receptor and Gαq. In NK1·Gq, the Gαq protein was fused to the far C-terminal end of the NK1 receptor, whereas in NK1·Gq-Δtail, the 72 most C-terminal residues of the C-terminal tail of the NK1 receptors were deleted, resulting in a fusion protein where Gαq was placed only 14 residues after the presumed palmitoylation site (Fig. 1). The NK1·Gq construct behaved rather similarly to the wild-type NK1 receptor with respect to signaling through the phospholipase C pathway, both in regards to Emax and EC50 for the substance P-stimulated inositol phosphate turnover as determined in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig.2 A). However, although fusion of Gαq to the far end of the C-terminal tail of the NK1 receptor impaired signaling through the adenylylcyclase pathway, this Gαs-mediated signaling was far from eliminated. In fact, the Emax of substance P-induced cAMP accumulation in the NK1·Gq construct was still ∼50% of that observed in the wild-type NK1 receptor (Fig. 2 B and TableI). In contrast, truncation of the tail of the NK1 receptor, i.e. shortening the spacer between the receptor and the Gαq, severely limited the ability of the receptor to signal through the Gαs-mediated adenyl cyclase pathway. Thus, in the NK1·Gq-Δtail construct, the response in cAMP accumulation was decreased 10-fold when compared with the wild-type NK1 receptor, i.e. from an Emax of 46 fmol/105 cells to 4.8 fmol/105 cells (Fig. 2 B and Table I). This effect was not caused by a decrease in expression level, because the Bmax was not decreased in the NK1·Gq-Δtail fusion protein (Table I). Moreover, the efficacy of substance P to induce inositol phosphate turnover was also close to that observed in the wild-type receptor, i.e. an Emax = 67 fmol/105 cells as compared with 84 fmol/105cells in the wild-type receptor. In the NK1·Gq-Δtail fusion protein, the dose-response curve for substance P induction of inositol phosphate turnover was however more shallow with a slope close to unity as compared with the more steep curves observed in the wild-type receptor and in the non-truncated NK1·Gq construct (Fig.2).Table ICompetition binding experimentsCompetition bindingInositol phosphate accumulationcAMP accumulationKd± S.E.Hill coeff. ± S.E.Bmax ± S.E.nEmax ± S.E.EC50 ± S.E.nEmax ± S.E.EC50 ± S.E.nnmfmol/105cellfmol/105cellnmfmol/105 cellnmNK1-wt0.12 ± 0.040.72 ± 0.0239 ± 7884 ± 10 1-bPerformed in parallel with the G-protein fusion constructs.

Although a more efficient decoupling of the NK1 receptor from Gαs signaling was achieved by truncating the C-terminal tail of the receptor in the NK1·Gq-Δtail fusion protein, still ∼10% of the response remained. However, during our general mutational analysis of the NK1 receptor, we discovered a point mutation in TM-III, Phe111 to Ser, which totally decoupled the receptor from Gαs signaling. This position, which in most 7TM receptors is occupied by a residue with a large aromatic or aliphatic side chain, is located at the extracellular end of TM-III at generic position III:07 facing toward II and VII (Fig. 1). If anything, substance P induced a small decrease in cAMP production in the [F111S]hNK1 mutant (Fig. 2 D). With respect of Gαq signaling, the dose-response curve for substance P-induced inositol phosphate turnover observed in the [F111S]hNK1 mutant was similar in shape to that found in the NK1·Gq-Δtail fusion protein, i.e. with a Hill coefficient of approximately unity (Fig. 2 C). A fusion protein similar to the NK1·Gq-Δtail was constructed, but Gαq was replaced by Gαs. Although both the potency of substance P and the shape of the dose-response curve for induction of cAMP production were very similar to what was observed in the wild-type receptor, the Emaxwas reduced to ∼60% in this NK1·Gs-Δtail construct (Fig. 3 B). Surprisingly, the close association of the NK1 receptor with Gαs had very little effect on the substance P-induced inositol phosphate accumulation, albeit the slope of the dose-response curve was closer to unity in the NK1·Gs-Δtail than in the wild-type receptor. This was also observed in the NK1·Gq-Δtail (Fig. 3 A). The competition binding curve for substance P in the wild-type NK1 receptor, transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and using 125I-substance P as a tracer was, as previously described, best fitted to a two component curve, identifying both a very high affinity state (Kd = 0.044 nm; 57%) as well as a high affinity state (0.60 nm; 43%) (Fig.4 A) (9Hastrup H. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, the displacement curve for the other endogenous NK1 ligand, neurokinin A (NKA) against 125I- substance P, was in the wild-type NK1 receptor also biphasic with an ∼50-fold difference between a high affinity site (Kd = 1.3 nm; 35%) and a low affinity state (Kd = 78 nm; 65%) (Fig. 4 B). In the simple NK1·Gq fusion construct, where the G-protein was fused to the C-terminal end of the receptor, the binding curve for substance P was indistinguishable from that observed in the wild-type receptor both with respect to affinity and Hill coefficient. However, in the NK1·Gq-Δtail construct, a monocomponent displacement curve (Hill coefficient = 1.0) was observed for substance P with an affinity (Kd = 0.44 nm) corresponding closely to the high affinity part of the two-component curve found in the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4 A). A monocomponent displacement curve was also observed in the NK1·Gs-Δtail construct for substance P (Hill coefficient = 1.1), and in this case the affinity for substance P (Kd = 0.02 nm) corresponded to the very-high affinity state observed for substance P in the wild-type receptor. Thus, each of the two high affinity states for substance P found in the wild-type NK1 receptor corresponds closely to the monocomponent states observed for the peptide in each of the tail-truncated fusion proteins with either Gαs or Gαq, respectively. Very similarly, the two-component competition curve for NKA against125I-substance P found in the wild-type NK1 receptor was resolved into the two corresponding monocomponent competition curves by the NK1·Gq-Δtail and the NK1·Gs-Δtail receptor fusion proteins (Fig. 4 B and Table I). Also in the case of NKA it was the NK1·Gs-Δtail construct that gave the high affinity state, whereas the NK1·Gq-Δtail construct displayed the more low affinity state (Fig.4 B). This surprising observation, namely that the complex between the receptor and Gαs results in the highest affinity states both for substance P and for NKA, was further substantiated by binding experiments using the [F111S]NK1 receptor mutant. In this mutant, which, as demonstrated above, is totally uncoupled from Gαs (Fig. 2 D), substance P showed an affinity of 0.8 nm corresponding to the lower of the two high affinity states (Fig. 5 A). NKA showed an affinity of 93 nm also corresponding to the lower of the two affinity states for that peptide on the wild-type NK1 receptor (Fig. 5 B). In both cases the competition curves observed in the [F111S]NK1 mutant were similar to those observed in the NK1·Gq-Δtail fusion protein, albeit slightly shifted to the right. The F111S mutation did not affect the antagonist binding profile, which implies that the receptor as such is not structurally destroyed nor misfolded in this mutant form (Table I and unpublished data). Several groups (25Regoli D. Boudon A. Fauchere J.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 551-599PubMed Google Scholar) have previously described that in the wild-type NK1 receptor, the affinity of so-called septide-like tachykinin peptides, here represented by NKA, is determined to be 50–100-fold lower in heterologous competition against125I-substance P than in homologous competition against themselves (Fig. 6). Also, the displacement curve for substance P determined in heterologous competition against 125I-NKA corresponds to the monocomponent, very high affinity state of the two high affinity states determined for substance P in homologous binding against itself,125I-substance P (Fig. 6 A). As shown in Fig. 6, this phenomenon was eliminated when a one-to-one receptor to G-protein interaction was secured. Thus, in both the NK1·Gq-Δtail (panels C and D), in the [F111S]hNK1 receptor mutant (panels E and F), as well as in the NK1·Gs-Δtail (panels G and H), the heterologous and the homologous competition binding curves were almost superimposable for both substance P and for NKA. As described above, using only 125I-substance P (Figs. 4 and 5), the NK1·Gq-Δtail and the [F111S]hNK1 receptors displayed the lower of the two affinity sites for both substance P and NKA, whereas the NK1·Gs-Δtail construct displayed the high affinity state, again for both substance P and NKA (Fig. 4). However, the picture is not totally perfect, because the high affinity state for NKA determined in the homologous binding experiments in the wild-type NK1 receptor is still ∼10-fold higher than the affinity determined in both homologous and heterologous binding experiments in the NK1·Gs-Δtail construct, Kd = 0.33 nm versus 3.2 nm (homologous) and 1.4 nm (heterologous) (Fig. 6, panels B andH). Thus, although the phenomenon of different affinities determined in heterologous versus homologous binding assays has been eliminated in for example the Gαs fusion protein with the truncated tail, the actual affinity for NKA is lower than in the wild-type. In the present study, fusion of the NK1 receptor to either of the two G proteins, through which it normally couples, has resolved both the phenomenon related to the two-component agonist binding property and the ambiguous problem of differences between affinities for agonists measured in homologous versus heterologous competition. In both cases, i.e. fusion to either Gαq or Gαs, monocomponent binding of agonists was accomplished, and the affinity for agonists was found to be identical in homologous and heterologous competition. These results indicate that the mixed pharmacological phenotype observed with the NK1 receptor in fact is a reflection of the occurrence of at least two different molecular phenotypes, which we interpret as two different active receptor conformations, in complex with the respective G proteins. Interestingly, especially the fact that the affinity for an agonist determined in homologous versus heterologous competition binding is normally far from identical (see below), this indicates that the molecular phenotypes in some cases are not readily interchangeable in the plasma membrane of the whole cell. It is often expected, that by simply fusing a G-protein to the C-terminal tail of a receptor, a situation with a cl"

We examined regulation of the protein in ischemic and reperfused isolated hearts and isolated ventricular myocytes. In isolated myocytes, extracellular signal-regulated kinases were important in regulating activity of the exchanger after recovery from ischemia. Ischemia followed by reperfusion caused a strong inhibitory effect on NHE1 activity that abated with continued reperfusion. Four major protein kinases of size 90, 55, 44, and 40 kDa phosphorylated the Na+/H+ exchanger. The Na+/H+ exchanger-directed kinases demonstrated dramatic increases in activity of 2–10-fold that was induced by 3 different models of ischemia and reperfusion in intact hearts and isolated myocytes. p90rsk was identified as the 90-kDa protein kinase activated by ischemia and reperfusion while ERK1/2 was identified as accounting for some of the 44-kDa protein kinase phosphorylating the Na+/H+ exchanger. The results demonstrate that MAPK-dependent pathways including p90rsk and ERK1/2 and are important in regulating the Na+/H+ exchanger and show their dramatic increase in activity toward the Na+/H+exchanger during ischemia and reperfusion of the myocardium.

Of the six known isoforms of the Na+/H+exchanger (NHE1-NHE6), NHE1 is the major isoform present in the myocardium (3Fliegel L. Wang H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1991-1999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ionic homeostasis is vital for normal myocardial function and the regulation of exchanger activity in the heart by hormones and growth factors via protein kinase-mediated signal transduction, plays an important role in maintenance of this homeostasis (3Fliegel L.

Res. 1999; 85: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The NHE1 protein is ∼815 amino acids in length and is thought to consist of a membrane domain with 12 integral membrane segments and a long intracellular carboxyl terminus of 315 amino acids. It is within this intracellular carboxyl terminus that regulation of exchanger activity is postulated to occur by phosphorylation on distal serine/threonine residues (1Fliegel L. Dibrov P. Fliegel L. The Na+/ H+ Exchanger. Springer/R. G. Landes Co., New York1996: 1-20Google Scholar, 2Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

Recently, serine 703 has been identified as one important amino acid which is phosphorylated by the protein kinase p90rsk (5Phan V.N. Kusuhara M. Lucchesi P.A. Berk B.C. Circ.

However, earlier work has demonstrated growth factor induced phosphorylation of several different peptides of the carboxyl-terminal region of the Na+/H+ exchanger (7Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J.

We have also shown that MAPK (ERKs) are involved in hormonal regulation of activity of the exchanger in skeletal muscle (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L. Lucchesi P.A. Haworth R. Wang K. Michalak M. Pelech S. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9151-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and more recently we have shown that both MAPK (ERKs) and p90rsk are involved in regulation of exchanger activity in the healthy rat myocardium (10Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Another protein kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) has been shown to phosphorylate the COOH-terminal domain in vitro (11Fliegel L. Walsh M.P. Singh D. Wong C. Barr A. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but it is not known if CaM kinase II directly regulates the exchanger activity in intact cells. It is well known that the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger during ischemia and reperfusion produces numerous secondary effects that lead to the exacerbation of tissue injury. The Na+/H+exchanger removes protons either during ischemia or during reperfusion which causes excess intracellular Na+. This results in either inhibition of the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers ability to extrude Ca2+, or reversal in activity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and accumulation of Ca2+. The increased intracellular Ca2+ results in a variety of detrimental effects to the heart. It has been shown that inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger activity, via the use of potent amiloride analogs as well as more recently developed NHE1-specific inhibitors, can prove beneficial to recovery from ischemia and reperfusion events (4Karmazyn M. Gan T. Humphreys R.A. Yoshida H. Kusumoto K. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 12Karmazyn M. Fliegel L. The Na+/ H+ Exchanger. Springer/R. G.

Various lines of evidence suggest that the Na+/H+ exchanger may be in an activated state during ischemia and/or reperfusion of the myocardium. α1-Adrenergic receptor stimulation regulates the antiporter in the myocardium causing both an alkalization of steady state intracellular pH (pHi) and an enhanced rate of Na+/H+ exchanger mediated recovery from an acid load (14Terzic A. Puceat M. Clement O. Scamps F. Vassort G. J. Physiol. 1982; 447: 275-292Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Iwakura K. Hori M. Watanabe Y. Kitabatake A. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Yoshida H. Kamada T. Eur.

Physiol. 1992; 263: C1096-C1102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α1-Adrenergic stimulation is known to exacerbate reperfusion induced arrhythmias and increased Na+/H+ exchanger activity may play an important role in this phenomenon (17Yasutake M. Avkiran M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 29: 222-230PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the 21-amino acid vasoactive peptide endothelin (ET-1) has also been shown to stimulate Na+/H+ exchange in cardiac myocytes (18Kramer B.K. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19Meyer M. Lehnart S. Pieske B. Schlottauer K. Munk S. Holubarsch C. Just H. Hasenfuss G. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91: 86-93PubMed Google Scholar). Under some circumstances endothelin may also aggravate ischemic reperfusion injury, possibly through Na+/H+exchanger activation (20Khandoudi N. Ho J. Karmazyn M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The protein kinase pathways that could be involved in regulation of the antiporter during ischemia and ischemia reperfusion are not known. It is known that multiple subfamilies of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38MAPK, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) are activated in ischemic-reperfused hearts in vivo (21Shimizu N.

Kim S. Iwao H. Taakeuchi K. Yoshikawa J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1269-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, some studies only implicate p38 and JNK (stress kinases) activation and not ERKs during ischemia, ischemia reperfusion, oxidative damage, and other stresses to the heart (23Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19943-19950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that not only can JNKs and p38 be activated during ischemia reperfusion, but MAPK (ERKs) can also be activated (27Knight R.J. Buxton D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that cardiac myocytes exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) show increased Na+/H+ exchanger activity via activation of MAPK-dependent pathways (ERK1/2) (28Sabri A. Byron K.L. Samarel A.M. Bell J. Lucchesi P.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is clearly possible that these signaling pathways may play one or more roles in regulation of the exchanger under ischemia and reperfusion conditions especially since MAPK-dependent pathways have been shown to be important in regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in the myocardium (10Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To date, no studies have shown definitively which kinases from the ischemic and reperfused heart phosphorylate the distal amino acids in the carboxyl terminus of the Na+/H+ exchanger. The purpose of our study was to examine regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in the myocardium during ischemia and reperfusion. We examined the ability of multiple protein kinases from ischemic and ischemia-reperfused myocardium to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger. This present study provides the first evidence of protein kinase-mediated regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in response to ischemia and ischemia reperfusion. The results also suggest that regulation of the myocardial Na+/H+ exchanger may be important in mitigating the damaging effects that ischemia and reperfusion have on the myocardium. PD98059, a MEK1 inhibitor, and SB202190, a p38 inhibitor, were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). Plasmid pGEX-3X, glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column, and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Protein G-PLUS agarose was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-ERK-1/2 (rabbit polyclonal), anti-phospho-ERK (mouse monoclonal), anti-RSK1 (goat polyclonal), anti-p38 (rabbit polyclonal), anti-CaM kinase II (goat polyclonal), anti-JNK2 (rabbit polyclonal), and anti-MEK1 (rabbit polyclonal) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-RSK (p90rsk) (mouse monoclonal) was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). MF-20 (mouse monoclonal) was purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). [γ-32]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Collagenase Type 2 was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Lakewood, NJ) and BCECF-AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Ottawa, ON), Sigma, or BDH (Toronto, ON). The carboxyl-terminal 178 amino acids of the rabbit cardiac Na+/H+ exchanger were expressed as described previously (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L. Lucchesi P.A. Haworth R. Wang K. Michalak M. Pelech S. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9151-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as a fusion protein with GST (PCRA) using the plasmid pGEX-3X. The Escherichia coli TOPP 2 strain was induced with 1 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. GST-Na+/H+ exchanger fusion protein was purified via glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography as described earlier (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L. Lucchesi P.A. Haworth R. Wang K. Michalak M.

Adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from either Charles River Canada (St. Constant, PQ) or Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN) and maintained in the Health Sciences Animal Care facility of the University of Western Ontario in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (Ottawa, ON). Rats were killed by decapitation and the hearts were immediately removed and perfused by way of the aorta at 37 °C with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer consisting of 120 mm sodium chloride, 4.63 mm potassium chloride, 1.17 mmpotassium phosphate monobasic, 1.25 mm calcium chloride, 1.2 mm magnesium chloride, 20.0 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 8.0 mm glucose, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 10 ml/min (29Gan X.T. Chakrabarti S. Karmazyn M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H993-H998PubMed Google Scholar). All hearts were equilibrated for 30 min, after which ischemia was induced for 30 min by completely stopping the flow with or without subsequent reperfusion for 30 min. Control hearts were perfused normally for 60 min. In another set of experiments, hearts were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min. This was followed by 30 min of buffer perfusion with or without 40 μm PD98059 (a MAPK kinase (MEK1) inhibitor), then 30 min of no flow (ischemia), followed by 15 min of reperfusion with or without 40 μm PD98059. At the end of the perfusions hearts were “freeze clamped” and stored at minus 80 °C. The heart tissue was homogenized at a high setting with a Polytron homogenizer for 30 s in 2.5 (v/w) of extraction buffer containing 50 mmtetrasodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged at 6,000 × g × 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g × 60 min at 4 °C. Western blot analysis was done using commercially available antibodies against ERK 1/2, phospho-ERK, p38, JNK2, p90rsk, MEK1, and MF-20 (cardiac sarcomeric myosin heavy chain). Ischemic-reperfused hearts were also perfused in the presence of the drug PD98059, to partially inhibit the MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway by inhibiting MEK1. Heart cell extracts from these experiments were prepared as above. To identify protein kinases that phosphorylated the Na+/H+ exchanger fusion protein, cell extracts (80 μg of protein) from control, ischemic, and ischemic-reperfused myocardium (with and without 40 μmPD98059) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE in a gel containing 1 mg/ml substrate. In-gel kinase assays were performed as previously described (10Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The gels were dried for autoradiography and visualization of phosphorylation. Equal amounts of protein were used for the in-gel kinase assays. We confirmed that equal amounts of protein were applied to the gels by Coomassie Blue staining of identically run gels or by Western blot analysis of identically run samples with an antibody against MF-20. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-RadDC protein assay. For one series of experiments samples in IGKAs were treated with 5 μm SB202190 during incubation with labeled ATP to inhibit p38 kinase. For immunoprecipitations, ERK-1/2, p38, RSK1, JNK2, and MEK1 antibodies were used. Extracts (1 ml) were pretreated by incubating with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (in experiments with ERK-1/2, anti-p38, JNK2, and MEK1 antibodies) or protein G-PLUS agarose beads (in experiments with anti-RSK1) for 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged for 1–2 min at 7000 rpm at 4 °C to remove nonspecifically adsorbed proteins bound to the resins. In addition, Sepharose beads used for immunoprecipitation were pretreated to reduce nonspecific binding. The beads were then incubated with heart cell extract for 2 h at 4 °C and washed with extraction buffer. For immunoprecipitation of protein kinases, 30 μl of 200 μg/ml stock anti-ERK-1/2, MEK1, JNK2, or anti-p38 was added to pretreated heart cell extract and this mixture was rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody-antigen complex was then added to pretreated protein A-Sepharose beads and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were next washed extensively in extraction buffer and solubilized in SDS-PAGE gel sample buffer. For the remaining immunoprecipitation, 10 μl of 200 μg/ml stock anti-RSK1 was added to protein G-PLUS agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The next day the heart cell extract was added to this antibody-bead complex and allowed to bind for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed extensively in extraction buffer and solubilized in SDS-PAGE gel sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were all analyzed by Western blotting and by in-gel kinase assay for their ability to phosphorylate the Na+/H+exchanger fusion protein. Primary myocyte cultures were prepared from neonatal Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat heart ventricles as described previously (10Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Isolated primary myocytes were plated onto glass coverslips for physiologic studies, or onto PrimariaTM (Falcon) culture dishes or flasks for collection of cell extracts. Myocytes were maintained for 4–5 days in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml selenium, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml linoleic acid, 3 mm pyruvic acid, 0.1 mm minimum essential medium non-essential amino acids, 10% MEM vitamin, 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, 100 μm l-ascorbic acid, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.1. Cells were serum-starved overnight prior to all experiments. Neonatal cardiac myocytes were made ischemic by incubation at pH 6.2 in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer containing 130 mm sodium chloride, 2.5 mm potassium chloride, 2.5 mm potassium cyanide (to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation), 1 mm potassium phosphate monobasic, 1.2 mm magnesium sulfate, 2 mm calcium chloride, and 20 mm HEPES for 4 h at 37 °C (modified from Bond et al. (30Bond J.M. Chacon E. Herman B. Lemaster J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C129-C137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). This ischemic treatment is referred to asI1. In other experiments, 10 mm2-deoxy-d-glucose was added to this medium to inhibit glycolytic ATP production and result in a more severe ischemia (referred to as I2) (30Bond J.M. Chacon E. Herman B. Lemaster J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C129-C137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To simulate reperfusion, the metabolic inhibitor was removed by “washout” with KRH buffer at pH 7.4 (without potassium cyanide) and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Control myocytes were incubated with KRH buffer, pH 7.4 (without potassium cyanide), for the same time period as the ischemic myocytes. Following the experiment, myocytes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and an extraction buffer containing 50 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (31Fliegel L. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Barr A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cells were then frozen on dry ice for 5 min, allowed to thaw on ice for 15 min, scraped, and transferred into microcentrifuge tubes. The myocyte extracts were sonicated for 10 s on ice and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein kinases from the extracts were analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against ERK 1/2, phospho-ERK, and MF-20 (cardiac sarcomeric myosin heavy chain) and for their ability to phosphorylate the Na+/H+ exchanger fusion protein using the in-gel kinase assay described earlier. Myocytes were grown on glass coverslips and the acetoxymethyl ester of 2′-7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein was used to measure steady-state pHi as described previously (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L. Lucchesi P.A. Haworth R. Wang K. Michalak M. Pelech S. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9151-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Wang H. Singh D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26545-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, pHi was measured using the dual excitation single emission ratio technique using a temperature-controlled Shimadzu RF5000 spectrofluorophotometer. Excitation wavelengths were at 452 and 503 nm with emission at 524 nm. Myocytes were serum-starved before all pHi measurements. Cells on coverslips were placed into a holder device and inserted into a 1 × 1-cm fluorescence cuvette at 37 °C and bathed in the ischemia and reperfusion (washout) buffers as stated above (KRH buffer at pH 6.2 or 7.4, respectively). Steady-state pHi was measured for 1 min after the specified ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion protocol (see above). In some experiments, the cells were pretreated with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) during the last 30 min of ischemia and during the reperfusion period. PD98059 was added during the reperfusion phase and at all subsequent steps. For other experiments, SB202190 (1 μm) was added during the ischemic phase as well as at the reperfusion phase. Rates of recovery from an acid load in control, ischemic, and ischemia-reperfused neonatal cardiac myocytes (with and without PD98059 or SB202190) were also measured following an acid challenge using the ammonium chloride prepulse method as previously described (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L. Lucchesi P.A. Haworth R. Wang K. Michalak M. Pelech S. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9151-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Wang H. Singh D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26545-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were treated either with an ischemia induced by using KCN only (I1) or with a harsher form of ischemia induced by using KCN and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (I2). Briefly, ammonium chloride (20 mm) was added for 4 min followed by a pH recovery that was obtained by transferring the cells to buffer containing 130 mm sodium chloride after a brief exposure to a Na+-free buffer. For measuring initial rate of recovery from an acid load we examined the initial changes in pHi during the first 10–20 s after sodium chloride addition. We calculated proton flux for all experiments involving rate of recovery from an acid load. Buffering capacity (B, millimole/liter/pH unit) was estimated as the amount of acid loaded divided by the observed change of cell pHi produced by this load. Buffering capacity was determined at various pHi by varying amounts of ammonium chloride. Proton flux ( JH+) produced due to the Na+/H+ exchanger after acid loading was calculated from the buffer capacity at mid point pH × ΔpH/Δ time essentially as described earlier (33Silva N.L.C.L. Wang H. Harris C.V. Singh D. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were quantified using a model BAS1000 PhosphorImager (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd) to examine radioactivity incorporated into protein (in-gel kinase assay). Analysis of these results was by Mann-Whitney U test and/or Student's unpaired t test on direct numerical values obtained from the image analysis. Quantification and analysis of results of pHi measurements was done using a Mann-WhitneyU test. Values presented are mean ± S.E. with at least four and up to eight experiments being done in every case; pvalues < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To observe the regulation of the endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger, the effect of ischemia and ischemia reperfusion on steady-state pHi of neonatal cardiac myocytes was examined. Isolated neonatal cardiac myocytes were grown on coverslips and serum-starved overnight prior to stimulation. We utilized methods that “chemically” induce ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion events similar to that observed in perfused hearts. This “chemical” ischemia acts by inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (I1), or by inhibiting both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis (I2) (30Bond J.M. Chacon E. Herman B. Lemaster J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C129-C137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1summarizes the effects of ischemia (I1) and ischemia reperfusion on steady-state pHi in the presence or absence of the MEK1 inhibitor 50 μm PD98059. Ischemia reduced steady-state pHi dramatically while 5 and 30 min of reperfusion brought about a complete recovery of normal pHi (to ∼7.2). Treatment of the myocytes with 50 μm PD98059 significantly reduced the ability of the cells to return pHi to the values observed without PD98059. This indicated that a MAPK (ERK) pathway is partially responsible for facilitating Na+/H+ exchanger activity during ischemia reperfusion in neonatal ventricular myocytes. PD98059 alone had no effect on resting pHi of isolated myocytes that had not undergone ischemia or reperfusion (not shown). To observe changes in proton efflux during ischemia and ischemia reperfusion, an ammonium chloride prepulse was used to induce acute acidosis in control myocytes and in various groups of myocytes treated with ischemia (I1 or I2) as described for Fig. 1. Three groups were examined. Control cells were treated with KRH buffer for 30 min to 4 h and then treated with ammonium chloride. This was followed by a brief period in Na+-free KRH buffer and then recovery in KRH buffer with normal Na+. These cells recovered rapidly from the acid load (Fig.2 A). A second group of cells (Isch) was given the same kind of treatment except that at all stages the KRH buffer was replaced either with KCN containing buffer (I1) or buffer used to induce chemical ischemia. These cells retained a much more acidic pHi at all stages and did not recover from an acid load (Fig. 2, A and B). The third group of cells (I/R) was subject to 3–4 h of chemical ischemia (either I1 or I2), followed by varying reperfusion periods (4.5–30 min) in normal KRH buffer (with or without PD98059 (I1) or SB202190 (I1 and I2)). They were then subjected to ammonium chloride-induced acid load and recovery in normal KRH buffer (with or without PD98059 or SB202190). Cells treated with PD98059 recovered much more slowly from the acid load in comparison to untreated cells and reached a lower steady state pHi (Fig. 2, A and B). There was no difference in the rate of recovery from an acid load when comparing PD98059-treated control cells and PD98059-treated cells subjected to ischemia and reperfusion (Fig. 2 B). Ischemia (I1) followed by reperfusion resulted in a large (up to 50%) reproducible, time-dependent decrease in the ability of cells to recover from an acid load. At both 12 and 17 min of reperfusion there was a decrease in the ability of cells to recover from acid load (Fig. 2,A-C). This effect largely disappeared after 30 min of reperfusion.

The electrogenic Na+-Ca2+ exchanger mediates a substantial component of transmembrane Ca2+ movement in cardiac myocytes and is up-regulated in heart failure. However, the role of the exchanger in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy is poorly understood. Thoracic aortic banding in mice induced 50–60% increases in heart mass and cardiomyocyte size. Despite the absence of myocardial dysfunction, steady-state NCX1 transcript and protein levels were increased to an extent similar to that reported in heart failure. As recent studies indicate that calcineurin is critical to the expression of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger genes, we inhibited calcineurin with cyclosporin. Calcineurin inhibition blunted the increases in NCX1 transcript and protein levels and eliminated the increases in heart mass and cell volume normally associated with pressure overload. To examine the functional significance of these changes, we measured Na+-Ca2+ exchanger current in two independent ways. Surprisingly, exchanger current density was decreased in hypertrophied myocytes, and this down-regulation was eliminated by calcineurin inhibition.

In each of these types of cardiac pathology, hypertrophy has a crucial compensatory function normalizing wall stress and oxygen consumption. At the same time, hypertrophy may be an early phase in a pathogenic process that culminates in heart failure. The molecular signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of hypertrophy and transition to heart failure are the subject of intense investigation (reviewed recently in Refs. 1Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar and 2Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Electrical remodeling, culminating in action potential prolongation, is a fundamental aspect of both ventricular hypertrophy (3Wickenden A.D. Kaprielian R. Kassiri Z. Tsoporis J.N. Tsushima R.

Delayed repolarization leads to increased dispersion of refractoriness within the diseased ventricle thereby predisposing to arrhythmia, syncope, and sudden death. Indeed, the clinical impact of cardiac hypertrophy stems largely from disordered electrical currents that predispose patients to devastating arrhythmias. Patients with echocardiographically documented cardiac hypertrophy are at significantly increased risk of malignant cardiac arrhythmia, which accounts for a substantial component of the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiac hypertrophy (7Brown D.W. Giles W.R. Croft J.B. Am. Heart J. 2000; 14: 848-856Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying these arrhythmias are poorly understood and the means of treating them disappointingly ineffective.

Calcium transport by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) 1Z. Wang, W. Kutschke, K. E. Richardson, M. Karimi, and J. A. Hill, submitted for publication. is a major mechanism of Ca2+ elimination during diastole (18Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). As NCX catalyzes the bidirectional exchange of three Na+ ions for a single Ca2+ ion, one net charge moves per reaction cycle generating a transmembrane current that approaches one-half the magnitude of the L-type Ca2+ current. Indirect inhibition of NCX by diminution of the transmembrane Na+ gradient from Na+-K+ ATPase blockade is thought to underlie the positive inotropic effects of digitalis glycosides. NCX expression is maximal near the time of birth and declines postnatally (19Boerth S.R. Zimmer D.B. Artman M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 354-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is required for normal cardiac development (20Wakimoto K. Kobayashi K. Kuro-o M. Yao A. Iwamoto T. Yanaka N. Kita S. Nishida A. Azuma S.

On the other hand, increased NCX may contribute to anoxia-induced cytosolic Ca2+ overload (30Ladilov Y. Haffner S. Balser-Schäfer C. Maxeiner H. Piper H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1868-H1876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has potentially proarrhythmic actions (24Pogwizd S.M. Qi M. Yuan W. Samarel A.M. Bers D.M. Circ.

Given the central role of Ca2+ metabolism in the pathogenesis of hypertrophy and the major role played by NCX in controlling intracellular Ca2+ levels, we hypothesized that NCX may be altered in hypertrophy. To test this hypothesis, we measured NCX1 transcript and protein levels in a model of compensated hypertrophy where systolic dysfunction or heart failure do not occur. To examine the functional significance of changes in NCX expression to the action potential prolongation of hypertrophy, we measured NCX activity by recording NCX current (INCX) using 2 independent means. Male mice (C57BL6, 6–8 weeks old) were subjected to pressure overload by thoracic aortic banding (TAB) (33Hill J.A. Karimi M. Kutschke W. Davisson R.L. Zimmerman K. Wang Z. Kerber R.E. Weiss R.M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2863-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Some mice were subjected to a sham operation in which the aortic arch was visualized but not banded. Perioperative (24 h) mortality was less than 5%. On the morning of post-operative day 1, TAB (or sham-operated) mice were randomized to receive 25 mg/kg CsA (or an equal volume of vehicle) subcutaneously twice daily. Sham-operated mice were similar in every aspect to unoperated controls, and vehicle injections were similarly without effect. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated by retrograde enzymatic perfusion and superfused at 1–2 ml/min (21–23 °C) with Tyrode's solution containing (mmol/liter) 137 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 1.0 CaCl2, 10.0 dextrose, 10.0 HEPES (pH 7.4). Calcium-tolerant, quiescent myocytes with typical rod-shaped appearance and clear cross-striations were chosen for experimentation. Borosilicate glass capillaries (7052 glass, 1.65-mm OD, A-M Systems) were prepared with tip resistances of 1.5–3.0 MΩ when filled with solution containing (mmol/liter): 130.0 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 10.0 HEPES, 5.0 EGTA, 5.0 Mg2ATP, 5.0 Na-creatine phosphate, 0.5 GTP-Tris (pH 7.2). Tip potentials were compensated before the pipette touched the cell. After obtaining whole cell voltage clamp with a gigaohm seal, whole cell membrane capacitance was calculated as the time integral of the capacitive response to a 10 mV hyperpolarizing step. Cells with significant leak current (≥100 pA) were rejected (≈20%). When measuring whole cell currents (depolarized every 15 s), series resistance and membrane capacitance were compensated electronically ≥85%. Myocytes were held at −80 mV with a pipette filled with a solution containing (mmol/liter) 15 NaCl, 100 CsCl, 30 tetraethylammonium-Cl, 5 MgATP, 10 HEPES, and 5.5 dextrose (pH 7.1 adjusted with CsOH). The voltage-clamped cell was superfused in a microstream containing (mm) 138 NaCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 4.4 KCl, 1.08 CaCl2, 2 CsCl, 0.1 BaCl2, 11 dextrose, and 24 HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH to give a final extracellular [Na+] ([Na+]o) of 145 mm). After a train of steady-state conditioning pulses (eight 200-ms pulses to 0 mV, 0.25 Hz), the cell was rapidly switched to a solution containing 10 mmol/liter caffeine and superfused for 6 s. Myocytes were depolarized to −45 mV from a holding potential of −90 mV to inactivate sodium current. The voltage was then stepped to +80 mV and ramped down to −140 mV to induce remaining currents. After currents reached steady state, the protocol was repeated in the presence of 5 mm NiCl2. In this way, INCX is defined as the nickel-sensitive current induced during the ramped potential (24Pogwizd S.M. Qi M. Yuan W. Samarel A.M. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Pipette solutions contained (mmol/liter) 45 CsCl, 55 Cs-methanesulfonic acid, 10 ATP-Tris, 0.3 GTP-Tris, 20 HEPES, 5 BAPTA, 5 DiBr-BAPTA, 10.8 MgCl2, 2.21 CaCl2, and 14 NaCl (pH 7.3 with CsOH). Bath solution contained (mm) 137 NaCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 5.4 CsCl, 1.0 CaCl2, 10 dextrose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH) plus 10 μm nifedipine. Purified membrane proteins were prepared from 3 left ventricles harvested from mice subjected to the 4 treatments conditions listed (sham-operated controls, TAB, TAB + CsA, CsA). These proteins were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with ECL detection. Using standard methods, total RNA (50 μg) was fractionated by electrophoresis in a denaturing formaldehyde/agarose gel, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane, and hybridized with a riboprobe specific to NCX (34Reed T.D.

An NCX-specific riboprobe was synthesized in vitro (MaxiScript, Ambion) using a cDNA corresponding to −31 to +118 base pairs relative to the AUG codon of NCX1 (cDNA kindly provided by Dr. Muthu Periasamy (34Reed T.D.

The complex was subjected to ethanol precipitation followed by separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The products were then visualized by exposure to autoradiographic film. Averaged data are reported as mean ± S.E. Sample sizes are listed as n = x/y to denote x cells from y mice. Statistical significance was analyzed using a Student's unpaired t test or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's method forpost-hoc pairwise multiple comparisons.

Circulation. 1996; 94: 992-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To examine NCX1 expression in compensated hypertrophy, we measured steady-state levels of NCX1 transcript following induction of hypertrophy by pressure overload. Northern blot analysis of NCX1 mRNA in LV myocardium demonstrated a 7-kb hybridization band, corresponding to the expected position for NCX1 (18Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). Steady-state transcript levels increased significantly in hearts hypertrophied by pressure overload (26 ± 4%, n = 2, p < 0.05). To quantify changes in NCX1 transcript levels, a ribonuclease protection assay was employed. Using a probe specific for the N-terminal region of the NCX1 cDNA, a 118-base pair band was protected (Fig.2 C). Hypertrophy was associated with a 75 ± 17% (n = 3, p < 0.05) increase in NCX1 transcript levels. Recent work has shown that calcineurin is critical to the expression of NCX genes (35Lei L. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To test the role of calcineurin in hypertrophy-associated increases in NCX1 transcript levels, we exposed mice to cyclosporin (CsA), a specific inhibitor of calcineurin (36Clipstone N.A. Fiorentino D.F. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26431-26437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,37Husi H. Luyten M.A. Zurini M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14199-14204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were randomized on the morning following TAB (or sham operation) to receive either CsA (25 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily) or vehicle. As previously reported1 (33Hill J.A. Karimi M. Kutschke W. Davisson R.L. Zimmerman K. Wang Z. Kerber R.E. Weiss R.M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2863-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), pressure-overloaded hearts exposed to CsA (TAB + CsA) failed to develop significant hypertrophy assayed as either heart mass (HW/BW), myocyte surface area, or myocyte cell capacitance (Fig. 1). Mice exposed to CsA grew, gained weight, and behaved normally. Interestingly, we found that the pressure overload-induced increase in NCX1 transcript levels was partially blocked by CsA (Fig. 2). This suggests that calcineurin is involved in the transcription of the NCX1 gene and/or in the stability of NCX1 mRNA. CsA treatment alone had no effect on NCX transcript levels. To determine the effects of pressure overload on expression of NCX protein, we measured NCX protein levels by semiquantitative immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3). Left ventricular membrane proteins were prepared from mice subjected to TAB, TAB + CsA, and CsA only, and compared with sham-operated controls. As expected (18Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), the mature exchanger protein (120 kDa) co-purifies with an active fragment of 70 kDa. Quantification of the 70-kDa protein bands by densitometry revealed a statistically significant increase (71 ± 17%, n = 5, p < 0.05) in NCX steady-state protein levels in hypertrophied myocytes. This increase is similar to the degree of NCX up-regulation reported in models of heart failure (23O'Rourke B. Kass D.A. Tomaselli G.F. Kaab S. Tunin R. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 24Pogwizd S.M. Qi M. Yuan W. Samarel A.M. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Correlating with changes in steady-state transcript levels (Fig. 2), we found that NCX protein levels in cells isolated from hearts treated with CsA were intermediate between non-hypertrophied cells (control or CsA only) and cells with significant hypertrophy (Fig. 3). NCX mediates a substantial component of membrane current and is the major mechanism of Ca2+extrusion during diastole. To examine the effects of pressure overload on NCX activity, inward NCX current (INCX) was induced by sudden release of Ca2+ from SR stores using caffeine (Fig. 4). Whole cell currents were measured in dissociated ventricular myocytes, andINCX density was calculated by normalizing total current to cell membrane capacitance. In order to minimize the effects of differential SR Ca2+ loading, myocytes were subjected to a train of conditioning impulses prior to caffeine application. Given that NCX transcript and protein levels are increased in hypertrophy (Figs. 2 and 3) and heart failure (21Studer R. Reinecke H. Bilger J. Eschenhagen T. Bohm M. Hasenfuss G. Just H. Holtz J. Drexler H. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Flesch M. Schwinger R.H.G. Schiffer F. Frank K. Sudkamp M. Kuhn-Regnier F. Arnold G. Bohm M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 992-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23O'Rourke B. Kass D.A. Tomaselli G.F. Kaab S. Tunin R. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 24Pogwizd S.M. Qi M. Yuan W. Samarel A.M. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), our working hypothesis was that INCX would be similarly increased. Surprisingly, in myocytes hypertrophied by surgical pressure overload, the caffeine-induced peak inward current transient (0.7 ± 0.1 pA/pF, n = 8/5) was significantly diminished (32%, p < 0.01) compared with control (1.0 ± 0.1 pA/pF, n = 10/5) (Fig. 4). As the caffeine-induced inward current is a complex function of several factors including SR Ca2+ stores (see Refs. 38Terracciano C.M.N. De Souza A.I. Philipson K.D. MacLeod K.T. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 651-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and 39Su Z. Bridge J.H. Philipson K.D. Spitzer K.W. Barry W.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar for discussions of the interpretation of these measurements), we also estimated the magnitude of SR Ca2+ stores by integrating the caffeine-induced inward current. SR Ca2+ stores were not statistically significantly different in TAB (0.9 ± 0.2 pA/pF,n = 8/5) versus control myocytes (1.0 ± 0.1 pA/pF, n = 10/5) (Fig. 4 E). To confirm our preliminary measurements of diminishedINCX in hypertrophy, additional independent measures of NCX activity were employed. Under physiological conditions, NCX mediates inward current during diastole and during the terminal phase of the action potential. During the upstroke of the action potential, however,INCX is outward (“reverse mode Ca2+ entry”), mediating Ca2+ influx at the onset of systole (although the physiological significance of this latter mode is debated (40Barry W.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 41Isenberg G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)). For this reason, we measured inward and outward INCX using a voltage-clamp protocol (24Pogwizd S.M. Qi M. Yuan W. Samarel A.M. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), comparing currents in the presence and absence of 5 mm Ni2+. Whole cell currents were measured in dissociated ventricular myocytes, and INCXdensity was calculated by normalizing total current to cell membrane capacitance. INCX density measured in control myocytes was 1.6 ± 0.1 pA/pF (n = 30/11) at +80 mV and −0.24 ± 0.07 pA/pF (n = 30/11) at −80 mV. Confirming our preliminary findings with caffeine (Fig. 4), myocytes hypertrophied by surgical pressure overload (TAB) exhibited statistically significantly less INCX (0.6 ± 0.1 pA/pF at +80 mV, n = 20/8, decreased 61%,p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). Exposure to CsA blocked the increase in heart mass and myocyte size (Fig. 1) and blunted the increases in NCX1 transcript (Fig. 2) and protein levels (Fig. 3). To examine the effects of calcineurin inhibition on NCX activity, INCX was measured in myocytes isolated from hearts exposed to CsA.INCX density in hearts subjected to TAB + CsA (1.25 ± 0.08 pA/pF at +80 mV, n = 12/4) was not significantly different from control mice (Fig. 5). Exposure to CsA alone was similarly not associated with significant changes inINCX density (1.35 ± 0.08 pA/pF at +80 mV,n = 18/4) (Fig. 5). In recent years, the importance of calcium-regulated pathways controlling transcription in hypertrophy has emerged (reviewed in Ref.1Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In heart failure, control of diastolic Ca2+ levels by up-regulated NCX has been proposed to have either adaptive (29Terracciano C.M.N. Philipson K.D. MacLeod K.T. Cardiovasc.

Circulation. 1999; 99: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This increase in NCX activity shifts the clearance of diastolic Ca2+ from uptake into the SR toward trans-sarcolemmal extrusion into the extracellular space. In the long run, this homeostatic response may lead to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (44Pieske B. Maier L.S. Bers D.M. Hasenfuss G. Circ.

https://openalex.org/W1996384857,"Matrilin-4 is the most recently identified member of the matrilin family of von Willebrand factor A-like domain containing extracellular matrix adapter proteins. Full-length matrilin-4 was expressed in 293-EBNA cells, purified using affinity tags, and subjected to biochemical characterization. The largest oligomeric form of recombinantly expressed full-length matrilin-4 is a trimer as shown by electron microscopy, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. Proteolytically processed matrilin-4 species were also detected. The cleavage occurs in the short linker region between the second von Willebrand factor A-like domain and the coiled-coil domain leading to the release of large fragments and the formation of dimers and monomers of intact subunits still containing a trimeric coiled-coil. In immunoblots of calvaria extracts similar degradation products could be detected, indicating that a related proteolytic processing occurs in vivo. Matrilin-4 was first observed at day 7.5 post-coitum in mouse embryos. Affinity-purified antibodies detect a broad expression in dense and loose connective tissue, bone, cartilage, central and peripheral nervous systems and in association with basement membranes. In the matrix formed by cultured primary embryonic fibroblasts, matrilin-4 is found in a filamentous network connecting individual cells. Matrilin-4 is the most recently identified member of the matrilin family of von Willebrand factor A-like domain containing extracellular matrix adapter proteins. Full-length matrilin-4 was expressed in 293-EBNA cells, purified using affinity tags, and subjected to biochemical characterization. The largest oligomeric form of recombinantly expressed full-length matrilin-4 is a trimer as shown by electron microscopy, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. Proteolytically processed matrilin-4 species were also detected. The cleavage occurs in the short linker region between the second von Willebrand factor A-like domain and the coiled-coil domain leading to the release of large fragments and the formation of dimers and monomers of intact subunits still containing a trimeric coiled-coil. In immunoblots of calvaria extracts similar degradation products could be detected, indicating that a related proteolytic processing occurs in vivo. Matrilin-4 was first observed at day 7.5 post-coitum in mouse embryos. Affinity-purified antibodies detect a broad expression in dense and loose connective tissue, bone, cartilage, central and peripheral nervous systems and in association with basement membranes. In the matrix formed by cultured primary embryonic fibroblasts, matrilin-4 is found in a filamentous network connecting individual cells. von Willebrand factor A epidermal growth factor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ESI Q-TOF, electrospray ionization quadrupole/time-of-flight dithiothreitol phosphate-buffered saline mass spectrometry electrospray ionization The matrilins are a novel family of oligomeric extracellular proteins containing von Willebrand factor A (vWFA)1-like domains (1Deák F. Wagener R. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In mouse, four matrilins exist with matrilin-1, previously referred to as cartilage matrix protein, being the prototype member. The expression of matrilin-1 and -3 is restricted to skeletal tissues, whereas the matrilin-2 and -4 have a broad tissue distribution. It has been suggested that matrilins act as adapter molecules connecting other proteins and proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix (2Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse matrilin-4 has the modular structure typical for matrilins and consists of two vWFA-like domains connected by four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and a C-terminal α-helical coiled-coil domain predicted to mediate oligomerization (3Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, a unique splice variant, which does not contain the N-terminal vWFA-like domain, was identified in mouse (3Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Matrilin-4, like matrilin-1, lacks the stretch of frequently positively charged amino acids found in other matrilins between the signal peptide cleavage site and the vWFA-like domain at the N-terminal end of the mature protein. The mouse matrilin-4 precursor consists of 624 amino acid residues, and after cleavage of the 21-amino acid signal peptide a mature protein with a predicted minimal mass of 66.4 kDa is formed (3Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Human matrilin-4 is highly homologous to the mouse protein with an overall identity of 91% and a maximum identity of 97% in the second vWFA-like domain. Due to a mutation in the splice donor site of the third intron of the human gene, the exon, which corresponds to that specifying the first EGF-like domain in mouse, is not expressed in man. Instead of the four EGF-like domains present in mouse, the human matrilin-4 contains three, two, or one EGF-like domains, probably depending on a differential usage of splice acceptor sites in the exons coding for EGF-like domains (4Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When matrilin-4 expression was studied in the mouse by Northern hybridization, mRNA could be detected in lung, sternum, brain, kidney, and heart (3Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the human, matrilin-4 expression was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in lung and placenta, as well as in the embryonic kidney cell line 293-EBNA and in WI-26 fibroblasts (4Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The broad tissue distribution is reminiscent of that of matrilin-2, and phylogenetic analyses show (1Deák F. Wagener R. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that matrilin-4 and matrilin-2 descend from a common ancestor, further indicating a close relationship. We recombinantly expressed the full-length mouse matrilin-4 in a mammalian expression system. The recombinant protein was used for production of a specific antiserum, which allowed immunohistochemical characterization of matrilin-4 expression in the mouse and an analysis of supramolecular assembly forms in the extracellular matrix formed by cultured primary embryonic fibroblasts. The full-length protein was used for structural studies by which the molecular dimensions and oligomeric state of recombinant matrilin-4 could be determined. Structural analysis also revealed a unique, conserved cleavage site used for proteolytic processing of matrilin-4. Extraction of native matrilin-4 from mouse tissues allowed a characterization of the naturally occurring oligomers by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Murine matrilin-4 cDNA was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on total lung RNA. Suitable primers introduced a 5′-terminal SpeI and a 3′-terminalNotI restriction site. The cDNA was inserted into the expression vector pCEP-Pu (5Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) downstream of the sequence encoding the BM-40 signal peptide. The vector contained either an N-terminal His6-Myc tag downstream of the signal peptide coding sequence and upstream of a 5′ NheI site (6Wuttke M. Characterization of the Structure and Function of Recombinant and Native Human Bone Sialoprotein. Doctoral dissertation. University of Cologne, Germany2001Google Scholar) or a C-terminal strepII tag (7Smyth N. Odenthal U. Merkl B. Paulsson M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar) downstream of the NotI site. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into the human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cell line (Invitrogen) by transfection with DAC-30TM (Eurogentec). The cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml) and were transferred to serum-free medium for harvesting of the recombinant protein. After filtration and centrifugation (1 h, 10,000 × g), cell culture supernatant containing the N-terminally His6-Myc-tagged matrilin-4 was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (10 ml, Qiagen). The bound fraction was eluted with 0.25 mimidazole in 2 m urea, 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0. The matrilin-4-containing fractions were diluted with an equal volume 2m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and concentrated on a SP HiTrap column (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Elution was achieved with 1 m NaCl, 2 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The cell culture supernatant containing the C-terminally strepII-tagged matrilin-4 was dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, applied to a streptactin column (3 ml, IBA), and eluted with 2.5 mm desthiobiotin, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0. The purified, N-terminally His6-Myc-tagged matrilin-4 was used to immunize rabbits. The antiserum obtained was purified by affinity chromatography on a column containing the C-terminally strepII-tagged matrilin-4 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific antibodies were eluted with 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.5, and the eluate was neutralized with 1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.8. Mouse calvaria was extracted for 6 h at 4 °C with 10 volumes (ml/g wet tissue) of 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA and 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and mouse brain each consecutively with 5 volumes for 1 min at 4 °C with 0.15m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), TBS containing 10 mm EDTA, TBS containing 10 mmEDTA and 4 m urea, and finally 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA and 4 m GdnHCl. All extraction buffers contained 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). For immunoblots the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with the appropriate affinity-purified rabbit antibody diluted in TBS containing 5% low fat milk powder. Bound antibodies were detected by luminescence using peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), 3-aminophthalhydrazide (1.25 mm),p-coumaric acid (225 μm), and 0.01% H2O2. For N-terminal sequencing, proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). Protein bands were cut out and their N-terminal amino acid sequences determined in a Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Tissues from newborn mice were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, at 4 °C, washed overnight with PBS (4 °C), dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 7 μm were cut, mounted on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-treated glass slides, dewaxed in xylene, and rehydrated. After washing in PBS they were digested with 110 milliunits/ml proteinase K, postfixed, and acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydride. The sections were hybridized overnight at 50 °C with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes covering the nucleotides 9–704 of the matrilin-4 cDNA (3Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the sections were washed in 50% formamide, 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl containing 0.03 sodium citrate) for 30 min at 50 °C, digested with RNase A, washed once with 2× SSC and twice with 0.2× SSC for 20 min at 50 °C. The immunological detection of the digoxigenin-labeled sections was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with additional use of polyvinyl alcohol in the detection solution (9De Block M. Debrouwer D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of fetal, newborn, and 6-week-old mice. The tissues were prefixed, and the tissues from 6-week-old mice were demineralized with 5% HNO3 overnight at 4 °C. After demineralization the tissues were transferred for 24 h into 5% Na2SO4. Deparaffinization ensued through incubation for 30 min in Rotihistol (Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 52 °C. After rehydration, the sections were digested with hyaluronidase (500 units/ml PBS, pH 5–6; Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by proteinase K (5.5 milliunits/ml, in 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; Sigma) at 37 °C for 5–10 min. They were briefly washed with PBS and postfixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After three washing steps, the sections were blocked for 1 h with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS and incubated with the affinity-purified matrilin-4 antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies were visualized by consecutive treatment of the sections for 1 h with biotin-SP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Dianova). All antibodies and the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin were diluted in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS, and the slides were developed with fast red TR/naphthol (Sigma). Immunofluorescence and peroxidase staining was performed as described previously (10Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto glass or permanox chamber slides, and after reaching confluence cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS, and immunolabeling was done by incubation with affinity-purified antibodies to matrilin-4 for 1 h followed by Cy™3-conjugated affinity-pure goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Negative staining was performed as described previously (11Piecha D. Muratoglu S. Mörgelin M. Hauser N. Studer D. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Deák F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13353-13361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) using non-reduced or reduced samples of C-terminally strepII-tagged matrilin-4 (5–10 μg/ml) stained with 0.75% uranyl formate. Reduction was carried out for 2 h at 20 °C using dithiothreitol (DTT) at concentrations between 0.05 and 10 mm. The reaction was stopped by alkylation with a 3-fold excess of N-ethylmaleimide for 1 h at 20 °C prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. The sample that showed quantitative conversion to the monomeric form at the lowest DTT concentration was subjected to electron microscopy. Cut-out gel bands were reduced with 20 mm DTT for 15 min at 37 °C and alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The in gel digestion with trypsin or endoprotease Glu-C was carried out overnight at an enzyme concentration of 12.5 ng/μl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. Subsequent elution was performed in two steps with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (2:3) for a total of 30 h. The supernatants were pooled and dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and the peptides were dissolved in 5% formic acid. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was carried out in a Bruker Reflex III mass spectrometer equipped with a 26-sample SCOUT source and video system, a nitrogen UV laser (λmax= 337 nm), and a dual channel plate detector (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). 1 μl of the sample solution was placed on the target, and 1 μl of a freshly prepared saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) in acetonitrile/H2O (2:1) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added. For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of intact proteins, sinapinic acid (Aldrich) was used as matrix. When required, the protein was reduced with 0.01 m DTT on the target for 1 h at 37 °C. Cations were detected and analyzed utilizing the high mass detector in the linear mode of a Bruker Reflex III. Calibration was based upon the Mr of recombinant protein A (Repligen) of 44,610.3 and bovine serum albumin dimer (Sigma) of 132,859.0, respectively. Between 50 and 500 single laser shots were summed into an accumulated spectrum. External calibration was carried out using a mixture of six synthetic peptides with molecular masses between 1046 and 2466 Da as well as the protonated dimer of the matrix (379 Da). Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out with a Micromass Q-TOF II instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The samples were introduced by nano-ESI. Prior to the analysis the samples were desalted and concentrated using home-built microcolumns consisting of ∼2.5 μl of C18-reversed phase material (ODS-AQ, 120 Å, 50 μm; YMC Europe, Schermbeck, Germany) in a gel-loader tip (Biozym, Hessisch-Oldendorf, Germany). The adsorbed peptides were washed with 5% formic acid and subsequently eluted with 3 μl of 5% formic acid/methanol (1:1) directly into a metal-coated nanospray capillary (Protana A/S, Odense, Denmark). Spray voltage was adjusted between 2700 and 3000 V, and block temperature was set to 30 °C. For MS experiments collision energy was set to 12 V, whereas for MS/MS experiments this was raised to a value between 25 and 40 V depending on size and charge state of the precursor ion to obtain optimal fragment ion spectra. Calibration was carried out between m/z 400 and 2500 using 40 mmH3PO4. cDNAs encoding the sequence of mature mouse matrilin-4 were cloned into vectors carrying nucleotide sequences coding for either an N-terminal His6-Myc tag (HM4) or a C-terminal strepII tag (M4S). The use of different tags at different positions allowed the evaluation of their potential effects on the properties of the recombinant protein. The constructs were inserted into the pCEP-Pu vector utilizing the secretion signal sequence of BM-40 (5Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids were introduced into human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells and maintained in an episomal form. The secreted matrilin-4 protein constructs were purified from the cell culture medium by affinity chromatography on either a streptavidin or a Ni2+ column. The correct usage of the predicted signal peptide cleavage site was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing of the purified recombinant strepII-tagged matrilin-4. SDS-PAGE analysis of both the N- and C-terminally tagged proteins showed the presence of trimers, dimers, and monomers, indicating that the tags do not influence the oligomerization (Fig.1). The His6-Myc tag and the strepII tag contribute 5.5 and 1.3 kDa, respectively, to the mass of each subunit. Without reduction, His6-Myc-tagged matrilin-4 gave three strong bands with apparent molecular weights of 235 (t), 2To allow simple identification of protein components on the basis of the results of mass spectrometry (Fig. 2) and protein sequencing (Fig. 4), we introduce a nomenclature where t represents trimer, d represents dimer, and m represents monomer. These designations are followed by a − cc or a + cc. The − cc indicates that the coiled-coil region is absent from the subunit, and + cc shows that the fragment carries additional coiled-coil regions bound by disulfide bonds and derived from other cleaved subunits. The digit before cc refers to the number of these coiled-coil fragments when more than one is carried. For example m + 2cc means a monomer connected by disulfide bonds to two additional coiled-coil region fragments thereby forming a triple coiled-coil α-helix. For a schematic depiction of this nomenclature see Fig. 4. 155 (d + cc), and 66 kDa (m − cc), respectively, and fainter bands at 87 (m +2 cc) and 73 kDa (m). Due to incomplete closure of disulfide bonds minor amounts of uncleaved, free monomers are often seen in matrilin samples. The strepII-tagged matrilin-4 gave strong bands with apparent molecular weights of 210 (t), 150 (d + cc), and 95 kDa (m + 2cc), respectively, and fainter bands at lower molecular weights. The minor bands seen between 65 and 80 kDa most likely represent a mixture of intact monomers with proteolytically processed monomers. The band at 21 kDa is a disulfide-bonded complex of three coiled-coil region fragments (see also Fig. 4). Reduction of the strepII-tagged matrilin-4 yielded a strong band with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa (m) (Fig. 1). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of non-reduced, strepII-tagged matrilin-4 resulted in three single charged molecule ion peaks at 219 (t), 153 (d + cc), and 87 kDa (m + 2cc) (Fig.2 A). After complete reduction, one single molecule ion peak was detected at 72.9 kDa (m) (Fig.2 C). The theoretical molecular mass of the strepII-tagged, mature matrilin-4 is 67.6 kDa, indicating that 7% of the mass of the recombinantly expressed protein was contributed by post-translational modifications. The larger species observed without prior reduction presumably represent trimers and modified dimers and monomers of the 72.9-kDa subunit.Figure 4Proteolytic processing of matrilin-4.Schematic representation of the forms of matrilin-4 identified by mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE of recombinant proteins. cc, coiled-coil region.

Direct SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of non-purified culture media from 293-EBNA cells transfected with N- and C-terminally tagged matrilin-4 (Fig. 3) provided an indication of a C-terminal processing of matrilin-4. Bands that correspond to intact trimers as well as dimers and monomers with one and two additional coiled-coil strands, respectively, were observed (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Also truncated monomers lacking the coiled-coil domain of the N-terminally His6-Myc-tagged and C-terminally strepII-tagged matrilin-4 could be detected (Figs. 3 and 4). Furthermore, the C-terminal processing was confirmed by Western blot analysis of reduced samples from cell culture supernatant of 293-EBNA cells expressing N-terminally His6-Myc-tagged matrilin-4 (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). Both the unprocessed and the C-terminally processed matrilin-4 subunits were detectable by the antiserum against matrilin-4. We used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to confirm the C-terminal processing by analysis of the fragments released upon cleavage. Partial reduction of the strepII-tagged matrilin-4 on the target yielded new peaks at 146 (d) and 80 kDa (m + cc) in addition to the 72.9 kDa (m) fully reduced monomer (Fig. 2 B). This results from the loss of 7-kDa fragments from the 153-kDa (d + cc) and the 87-kDa (m + 2cc) molecule ions, respectively (Fig. 2 A). After complete reduction, in addition to the fully reduced monomer of 72.9 kDa, a molecule ion of 6944.8 Da (cc) was detected (Fig. 2 C,inset), presumably resulting from the release of a disulfide-bonded fragment. The mass of this fragment corresponds to the C-terminal end of the recombinant matrilin-4 starting with the amino acid residue Gly572 (3Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and lacking the very C-terminal lysine residue, with the theoretical mass of 6943.7 Da (Fig.4). Matrilin-4 fragments without the coiled-coil domain could not be detected as they do not bind to the streptactin column. SDS-PAGE of recombinant strepII-tagged matrilin-4 without prior reduction shows a band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼21 kDa (3cc) that is lost upon reduction (Fig. 1). Isolation of this band followed by in gel trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF analysis revealed the presence of a tryptic fragment of a mass of 2552.2 Da corresponding to the sequence Gly572 to Arg594, indicating a cleavage between amino acid residues Glu571 and Gly572 in the region between the second vWFA-like domain and the coiled-coil domain (Fig. 4). Under reducing conditions a 7-kDa (cc) fragment of strepII-tagged matrilin-4 was isolated by SDS-PAGE. Subsequent in gel digestion with trypsin and endoprotease Glu-C followed by ESI Q-TOF mass spectrometry yielded two sequences,572GIGATE and AAAWSHPQFE, originating from the N-terminal end and the C-terminal strepII tag of the 7-kDa (cc) fragment, respectively (Fig. 4), supporting that the fragment results from a proteolytic cleavage between the second vWFA-like domain and the two cysteine residues stabilizing the coiled-coil. In addition, the localization of the cleavage site between residues Glu571and Gly572 was unequivocally confirmed by Edman sequencing of the 21-kDa (3cc) band (Fig. 1) which gave572GIG(A/H)TELRS (Fig. 4). A cleavage at this point releases a matrilin-4 subunit, less its coiled-coil domain, which remains disulfide-bonded to the assembly domains from the other matrilin-4 chains (Fig. 4). The purified strepII-tagged full-length matrilin-4 was submitted to electron microscopy after negative staining with uranyl formate (Fig. 5). The protein particles were heterogeneous in size, and a closer examination of single particles revealed that all species from monomer to trimer were present in the sample, in agreement with the results from SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. At high magnification it was seen that in oligomers all subunits are joined at a single point in a manner reminiscent of the bouquet-like structure known from other matrilins (2Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13353-13361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This indicates assembly of the oligomers via the C-terminal coiled-coil domain. A compact structure was seen at the center of the particles, representing the C-terminal, globular vWFA-like domains. These are connected to the extending N-terminal vWFA-like domains (diameter 5 ± 1 nm) by a well resolved stalk made up from the four EGF-like repeats. The center-to-center distance between the vWFA-domains is 14 ± 2 nm. After mild reduction with 5 mm DTT, the monomers released show two globular units, representing vWFA-like domains, connected by the flexible rod of EGF-like repeats (results not shown). Such reduced monomers have a shape similar to subunits found in non-reduced samples with the same center-to-center distance between the globular domains. Purified, N-terminally His6-Myc-tagged matrilin-4 was used for the immunization of a rabbit. The resulting antiserum was affinity-purified by adsorption to a column of CNBr-Sepharose to which strepII-tagged matrilin-4 has been coupled. By this procedure antibodies specific for matrilin-4 were obtained that lacked reactivity to the tags. The specificity was verified by SDS-PAGE of culture media from 293-EBNA cells expressing N- and C-terminally tagged matrilin-4 followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3). It was further shown that these antibodies do not cross-react with other matrilins in immunoblots (Fig. 6 A). To study the structure of tissue-derived matrilin-4 and to identify similarities or differences to the recombinantly expressed protein, extracts from several murine tissues were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the affinity-purified antiserum against matrilin-4. Among these tissues, sternum, calvaria, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, cortex, lung, and muscle were positive, whereas heart, testis, colon, and adrenal gland were negative for matrilin-4 (results not shown). In an extract of murine calvaria, a major band with an apparent molecular mass of 200 kDa, representing the trimeric form of matrilin-4, was detected (Fig.6 A, lane 4). Two additional bands were detected at 180 and 170 kDa that may represent degradation products or alternative assembly forms of matrilin-4. A direct comparison after longer exposure of a calvaria extract with recombinant matrilin-4 shows bands in the tissue extract presumably corresponding to the 150-kDa dimer (d + cc), the 95-kDa monomer (m + 2cc), and the 67-kDa cleaved monomer (m − cc) bands of recombinant strepII-tagged matrilin"
https://openalex.org/W2089035269,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in muscle is a ligand-gated ion channel with an ordered subunit arrangement of α-γ-α-δ-β. The subunits are sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and assembled into the pentameric arrangement prior to their exit to the cell surface. Mutating the Arg313–Lys314 sequence in the large cytoplasmic loop of the α-subunit to K314Q promotes the trafficking of the mutant unassembled α-subunit from the ER to the Golgi in transfected HEK cells, identifying an important determinant that modulates the ER to Golgi trafficking of the subunit. The association of the K314Q α-subunit with γ-COP, a component of COP I coats implicated in Golgi to ER anterograde transport, is diminished to a level comparable to that observed for wild-type α-subunits when co-expressed with the β-, δ-, and γ-subunits. This suggests that the Arg313–Lys314 sequence is masked when the subunits assemble, thereby enabling ER to Golgi trafficking of the α-subunit. Although unassembled K314Q α-subunits accumulate in the Golgi, they are not detected at the cell surface, suggesting that a second post-Golgi level of capture exists. Expressing the K314Q α-subunit in the absence of the other subunits in ubiquitinating deficient cells (ts20) results in detecting this subunit at the cell surface, indicating that ubiquitination functions as a post-Golgi modulator of trafficking. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that subunit assembly sterically occludes the trafficking signals and ubiquitination at specific sites. Following the masking of these signals, the assembled ion channel expresses at the cell surface. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in muscle is a ligand-gated ion channel with an ordered subunit arrangement of α-γ-α-δ-β. The subunits are sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and assembled into the pentameric arrangement prior to their exit to the cell surface. Mutating the Arg313–Lys314 sequence in the large cytoplasmic loop of the α-subunit to K314Q promotes the trafficking of the mutant unassembled α-subunit from the ER to the Golgi in transfected HEK cells, identifying an important determinant that modulates the ER to Golgi trafficking of the subunit. The association of the K314Q α-subunit with γ-COP, a component of COP I coats implicated in Golgi to ER anterograde transport, is diminished to a level comparable to that observed for wild-type α-subunits when co-expressed with the β-, δ-, and γ-subunits. This suggests that the Arg313–Lys314 sequence is masked when the subunits assemble, thereby enabling ER to Golgi trafficking of the α-subunit. Although unassembled K314Q α-subunits accumulate in the Golgi, they are not detected at the cell surface, suggesting that a second post-Golgi level of capture exists.

As integral membrane components of lipid trafficking vesicles, unassembled subunits are re-localized to the ER, stabilized by chaperones and either assembled with neighboring subunits or targeted for degradation by ubiquitination and cleavage in the proteasome (4Keller S.H.

Cellular mechanisms that distinguish whether a protein is folded and/or assembled and directed to the cell surface or misfolded and/or unassembled and shuttled into a degradative pathway are poorly understood, especially for the polytypic membrane proteins represented by ligand-gated ion channels. The importance for shedding light on this topic is borne out by several debilitating disorders associated with mutations that are believed to cause misfolding and inhibit the trafficking of physiologically important ion channels. Examples include inherited mutations in potassium channel subunits that increase the propensity to develop cardiac arrhythmias (6Furutani M. Trudeau M.C. Hagiwara N. Seki A. Gong Q. Zhou Z.

In this study, we employ the nAChR α-subunits as a model to identify factors that modulate the trafficking of ion channel proteins into the secretory pathway. We approached this question by identifying mechanisms that restrict the placement of unassembled α-subunits at the cell surface and asked how subunit assembly abrogates these processes. The nAChR in muscle is a ligand-gated ion channel composed of two α-subunits and single β-, γ-, and δ-subunits which surround a central cation channel pore. As determined by subcellular fractionation, the unassembled α-subunits are confined primarily to the ER compartment (11Smith M.M. Lindstrom J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4367-4376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insignificant amounts of unassembled α-subunit are detected on the cell surface following transfection, transient expression in mammalian cells, and125I-α-bungarotoxin exposure (12Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S., Yu, X.M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, appreciable binding of 125I-α-bungarotoxin is detected on the cell surface when α-subunits are co-expressed with the β-, δ-, and γ-subunits, demonstrating that subunit assembly is a requirement for the cell surface expression (12Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S., Yu, X.M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Kreienkamp H.J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As the nAchR assembles into a pentamer, assembled α-δ and α-γ dimers and other intermediates are detected in intracellular pools of the cell (12Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S., Yu, X.M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Kreienkamp H.J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P.

However, the α-δ and α-γ dimers are also sequestered intracellularly, as evidenced by the lack of125I-α-bungarotoxin binding to the surface of intact cells. (12Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S., Yu, X.M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Kreienkamp H.J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the β-subunit with the α-, γ-, and δ-subunits is required to transport the assembled subunits to the cell surface. We therefore hypothesized that trafficking signals positioned in the α-subunit at the interface that assembles with the β-subunit are enclosed when the subunits assemble to form a circular pentamer. The trafficking signals then become sterically occluded from the cellular machinery that otherwise would retrieve proteins back to the ER. The major aim of this study was to identify the ER retrieval sequences in the α-subunit that inhibit the trafficking of the unassembled subunit beyond the ER. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the adjacent basic amino acid signal Arg313–Lys314 in the large cytoplasmic loop of the α-subunit regulates trafficking of the α-subunit from the ER to the Golgi. This is revealed in the trafficking characteristics of the α-subunit with the K314Q mutation that proceeds from the ER and accumulates in the Golgi when expressed in the absence of the other receptor subunits. Although the altered α-subunit proceeds to the Golgi, it does not express at the cell surface. Inhibition of ubiquitination results in detecting the α-subunit with the K314Q alteration at the cell surface. We therefore conclude that ubiquitination is a modulator for the Golgi to cell surface trafficking of the α-subunit. Thus, we disclose two mechanisms that regulate the trafficking of nAChR. One of these involves masking of ER retrieval sequences by assembly of the heterologous subunits that regulate the ER to Golgi trafficking of the α-subunit. The second mechanism regulates Golgi to cell surface trafficking and is modulated by ubiquitination. These two mechanisms may operate together to provide the “quality control” of the completed receptor that progresses to the cell surface. Western blotting and immunofluorescence protocols aimed at detecting the α-subunit employed the rat monoclonal antibody (mAb) 210, which recognizes an epitope in the extracellular domain (15Das M.K. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2470-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The antibody to α-mannosidase II used to detect the medial-trans-Golgi was a gift of Dr. M. Farquhar, University of California, San Diego. Antibody to γ-COP was provided by Dr. C. Harter, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, antibody to β-COP was purchased from Sigma, and antibody to calnexin was acquired from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). The secondary antibodies employed for immunofluorescence were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA), as were the peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies used in Western blot detection. The cDNAs encoding the mouse nAChR subunits are inserted in the EcoRI site in the expression vector pBR4 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Mutations were introduced in the wild-type cDNA template by employing the “Quickchange” method (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Subsequently, double-stranded DNA subjected to mutagenesis was subcloned into plasmids not exposed to the polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis procedures, and the introduced fragment was checked by automated sequencing. HEK-293 and ts20 (16Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cells were employed in these studies, which do not express nAChR at detectable levels. The receptor subunits were transiently expressed in these cells following gene transfection. Calcium phosphate precipitation was used for transfection in HEK cells. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown in 35-mm glass bottom dishes to ∼80% confluency and transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the α-subunit. For immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, cells were grown in 10-cm dishes, and 15 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the α-subunit was added to each transfected plate of cells. Plasmids encoding the other subunits were transfected at one-half the mass employed for the α-subunit. Following transfection, cells were grown at 37 °C for ∼48 h and then prepared for immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation. In ts20 cells, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was added to a 35-mm plate, and transfection employed a liposome incorporation method (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies, Inc.). ts20 cells express a mutant temperature-labile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (16Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 30 °C, the ts20 cells maintain their ability to ubuiquitinate proteins, but at 40 °C the mutant ubiquitin-activating enzyme is inactive, and cells lose this capacity. Following transfection, ts20 cells were grown for 24 h at 30 °C and then shifted to 40 °C and grown for another 15 h. ts20 cells were then fixed in paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence in the same manner as the HEK cells detailed below. Immunofluorescence methods were performed in Triton-permeabilized cells to detect intracellular protein or in non-permeabilized cells to detect α-subunits at the cell surface. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, rinsed, and quenched in PBS/glycine. Cells were then permeabilized and blocked in 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% fish gelatin (Sigma), and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Exposure to primary antibody was for 1 h in the permeabilization solution diluted with an equivalent volume of PBS. Exposure to secondary antibody conjugated to fluorophores was also for 1 h in the same buffer. Non-permeabilized cells were processed in the same manner except Triton X-100 was omitted. Following exposure to antibodies, cells were preserved in gelvatol and stored in the dark under refrigeration. Confocal images were taken with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 laser-scanning system attached to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope using a 40× oil NA 1.3 objective, and processed with Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA). The brightly fluorescent cells show evidence of gene transfection; other fainter appearing cells in the microscope field apparently do not express the transfected gene. Cells were washed in PBS adjusted to pH 8.0 and incubated in 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched in 50 mm glycine in PBS; cells were washed further and then lysed in 1% Triton, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, on ice with protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Pierce) were added to the mixture to isolate biotinylated protein. The beads were washed and sedimented, and Laemmli sample buffer was added to elute the bound protein. Other cells, transfected with the same calcium phosphate mixture, were lysed in the above buffer, and acetylcholine receptor subunits were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-β-subunit antibody (mAb 111). Similar numbers of harvested cells were rinsed in PBS, sedimented, and solubilized in 0.15m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton with protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on ice. The insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, and a stoichiometric excess of antibody to γ-COP or β-COP (clone M3A5, Sigma) was added to the soluble fraction for 30 min, followed by addition of IgG-Sepharose beads for another 45 min. Equivalent volumes of sample were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were developed with chemiluminescent techniques. Cells were transfected with the indicated subunit combinations, grown for 48 h, and blocked first with 10 mm carbamylcholine followed by exposure to 10 nm125I-α-bungarotoxin for 1 h; the resultant radioactive counts correspond to the residual nonspecific binding. Other cells, transfected with the same calcium phosphate mixture, were exposed directly to 10 nm125I-α-bungarotoxin. Acetylcholine receptor α-subunits are representative of the family of ligand-gated ion channels that display the general topology shown in Fig.1 A, consisting of one major extracellular domain, four transmembrane spans, and a large and small cytoplasmic loop (15Das M.K. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2470-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Lindstrom J. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 377-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The largest span of sequence is extracellular and is predicted to consist of the first 210 residues starting at the N terminus (17Lindstrom J. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 377-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The major cytoplasmic loop is thought to be located between residues 299 and 408 in the α-subunit and includes the trafficking signals examined in this study. Conservation in the adjacent basic sequences corresponding to positions 313–314 in the α-subunit is observed among most receptor subunits when alignments of the major cytoplasmic loops are examined (Fig.1 B), suggesting that this sequence may encode an important conservation of function. Therefore, an adjacent basic sequence at position 313–314 in the α-subunit (18Boulter J. Luyten W. Evans K. Mason P. Ballivet M. Goldman D. Stengelin S. Martin G. Heinemann S. Patrick J. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was selected as a candidate to be altered by site-directed mutagenesis from Arg313–Lys314 to Arg313–Gln314 (designated as the K314Q α-subunit) to examine whether subsequent changes occur in the trafficking characteristics. The potential trafficking signal RK was altered to RQ on the basis of its presence at an identical position in the β-subunit (Fig. 1 B), the subunit that facilitates transport of the assembled receptor to the cell surface (12Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S., Yu, X.M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,13Kreienkamp H.J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For control and comparison, transfected wild-type α-subunits expressed in ts20 cells (at 30 °C) generally display the reticulate-diffuse pattern reminiscent of proteins deposited in the ER (Fig. 2 A, panels aand b, red) and appear to overlap in pattern with endogenous calnexin (Fig. 2 A, panels a andc, blue), a diagnostic marker for the ER. Wild-type α-subunits expressed in ts20 cells also display minimal co-localization (Fig. 2 A, panel a) with a GFP-Golgi protein marker (panel d, green, GFP linked to the Golgi localization signal of galactosyltransferase (19Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar)), which was expressed in these cells by co-transfection with the plasmid DNA encoding the α-subunit. Since the GFP-Golgi protein marker was expressed from a transfected gene, only a subset of cells display its expression. Moreover, wild-type α-subunits expressed in HEK cells display minimal overlap with the endogenous medial-trans-Golgi marker α-mannosidase II (Fig.2 B, panel e), further substantiating that the unassembled wild-type α-subunits are sequestered primarily in the ER. In support of our experimental observations on the trafficking characteristics of unassembled wild-type α-subunits as revealed by transfection and confocal microscopy, subcellular separations employing sucrose gradients of α-subunits expressed in muscle cells from the endogenous gene also demonstrated that unassembled α-subunits are restricted to the ER (11Smith M.M. Lindstrom J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4367-4376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the numerous transfection and expression experiments employed over the course of our study, minimal overlap was observed between the unassembled wild-type α-subunits and endogenous α-mannosidase II. Thus, high levels of overexpression from the transfected gene did not appear to contribute to artificially induced trafficking patterns. In contrast to the wild-type α-subunits expressed alone, cells co-expressing α-subunits with β-, γ-, and δ-subunits display appreciable co-localization between the α-subunits and α-mannosidase II (Fig. 3 a), coinciding with the finding that co-transfection of plasmid DNAs encoding the entire complement of subunits in HEK cells results in detection of the receptor at the cell surface (13Kreienkamp H.J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Note that although significant co-localization between the α-subunits and α-mannosidase II is observed when the receptor subunits are co-expressed, a major fraction of α-subunits also display the reticulate-diffuse pattern suggestive of localization in the ER (Fig.3, a and b): this likely reflects the fraction of α-subunits not assembled with the other subunits or assembled receptor protein that did not exit the ER. As a further note, α-subunits co-expressed with the other receptor subunits in HEK cells yield glycosylated α-subunits that traffic to the cell surface and are fully cleavable with Endo-H in whole cell lysates (20Keller S.H. Kreienkamp H.J. Kawanishi C. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4165-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, Endo-H cleavage was not employed in this study as a tool to characterize α-subunit trafficking. To examine whether cytoplasmically positioned adjacent basic amino acid sequences modulate the trafficking of nAChR α-subunits, the Arg313–Lys314 sequence was altered into Arg313–Gln314, with the aim of conserving side chain volume but neutralizing the charge of the lysine residue to remove the potential trafficking signal. HEK cells were transfected and processed for confocal microscopy in the same manner as the wild-type α-subunits displayed in Figs. 2 B and 3. The confocal microscope image of cells expressing K314Q α-subunits is displayed in Fig. 4, with the α-subunits exhibited by FITC emission (Fig. 4 b, green) and α-mannosidase II displayed by rhodamine emission (Fig. 4 c, red). Theyellow coloration corresponds to overlap between the α-subunits and α-mannosidase II (Fig. 4 a). Evident co-localization is observed between the K314Q α-subunits and α-mannosidase II (Fig. 4 a), suggesting spatial overlap in the cell and strongly indicating that the K314Q α-subunit traffics to and is retained in the Golgi compartment. To verify that the observed co-localization is due to spatial overlap in the three-dimensional field of the confocal image as opposed to artificial channel crossover caused by overly bright emission, wavelengths corresponding to FITC and rhodamine were individually blocked to examine whether images became apparent in the non-emitting channel. Since images were not observed in the non-emitting channel, crossover was excluded as the cause for the yellowish coloration observed in the merged images. Furthermore, since the steady state expression levels of the wild-type and K314Q α-subunits are similar (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and4), overexpression and saturation of the quality control machinery of the cell can be excluded as the cause for the acquired trafficking characteristics of the K314Q α-subunit. Wild-type α-subunits, when expressed in the absence of other subunits, sediment as monomers upon sucrose gradient centrifugation (13Kreienkamp H.J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since residues in the extracellular region govern subunit assembly, the K314Q mutation is unlikely to promote assembly of the mutant α-subunit into a more complex structure such as a homopentamer. The above results therefore suggest that altering the adjacent basic amino acid signal Arg313–Lys314 into Arg313–Gln314 directly promotes the trafficking of the substituted α-subunit from the ER to the Golgi. The Arg313–Lys314 sequence therefore appears to be a major determinant that modulates the ER to Golgi trafficking of the α-subunit. Since this sequence is largely conserved among mouse nAChR subunits (Fig. 1 B), it can be postulated that it also plays a similar role in the trafficking of the other subunits. Proteins that have been retrieved back to the ER are incorporated into COP I vesicles that migrate in an anterograde direction from the intermediate compartment to the ER (1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Exposed adjacent basic amino acid sequences are known to interact with the COP I components that incorporate the retrieved proteins into the COP I vesicles (21Harter C. Pavel J. Coccia F. Draken E. Wegehingel S. Tschochner H. Wieland F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15080-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, in contrast to the isolated wild-type α-subunit, K314Q α-subunits as well as wild-type α-subunits co-expressed with the full complement of receptor subunits should be expected to display minimal interactions with the COP I components, since these proteins traffic to the Golgi. Pull-down experiments were performed in HEK cell lysates employing an antibody to the COP I component protein, γ-COP. Cells were transfected to express K314Q α-subunits, wild-type α-subunits, or co-express wild-type subunits with the β-, γ - , and δ-subunits. Similar numbers of cells, volumes of buffer, and amounts of samples loaded into the gels were maintained in all steps. Proteins were subsequently resolved in 10% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with an antibody to the α-subunit (mAb 210). The immunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 5,lanes 1 and 2) reflect the extent of COP protein recognition of the α-subunits when compared with the respective expression levels of the α-subunits displayed in the whole cell lysates (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). Presumably, due to a low affinity interaction that becomes more evident with cross-linking (21Harter C. Pavel J. Coccia F. Draken E. Wegehingel S. Tschochner H. Wieland F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11649-11654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), only a fraction of α-subunits remained associated with γ-COP after completion of the immunoprecipitation procedures employed in these experiments. The experimental observations indicate that wild-type α-subunits expressed alone have the most pronounced association with γ-COP (Figs. 5, A and B, lane 1), whereas the K314Q α-subunit (Fig. 5 A, lane 2) and wild-type α-subunits co-expressed with the β-, γ-, and δ-subunits (Fig.5 B, lane 2) display minimal associations. Note also that in the sample that displays the α-subunits co-expressed with the β-, γ-, and δ-subunits (Fig. 5 B, lane 2), a minor interaction of the α-subunits with γ-COP is apparent; this likely reflects the population of unassembled α-subunits present in these cells (13Kreienkamp H.J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Sugiyama N. Boyd A.E. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26575-26581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast to the interaction of the wild-type α-subunits with γ-COP, association with β-COP, another component of COP I coats (21Harter C. Pavel J. Coccia F. Draken E. Wegehingel S. Tschochner H. Wieland F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15080-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), was not detected. By employing the same buffer and conditions for immunoprecipitation, the β-COP antibody did not co-immunoprecipitate the α-subunits, although α-subunits were abundant in these cells, and β-COP was immunoprecipitated in the samples (data not shown). Taken together, the experimental findings suggest that recognition of unassembled α-subunits by the COP I complex is mediated through the Arg313–Lys314signal, which potentially directly interacts with γ-COP. Subunit assembly diminishes the interaction between the α-subunits and the COP 1 complex, which is reflected in the trafficking of the receptor beyond the ER compartment. To examine whether the K314Q α-subunit maintains the capacity to fold and assemble into the mature receptor pentamer, ligand binding assays were performed by protecting receptor-binding sites with carbamylcholine from 125I-α-bungarotoxin.

In this study, we examined the ability of TAO2 to activate stress-sensitive MAP kinase pathways in cells and the relationship between activation of TAO2 and potential downstream pathways. Over-expression of TAO2 activated endogenous JNK/SAPK and p38 but not ERK1/2. Cotransfection experiments suggested that TAO2 selectively activates MEK3 and MEK6 but not MEKs 1, 4, or 7. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that endogenous TAO2 specifically associates with MEK3 and MEK6 providing one mechanism for preferential recognition of MEKs upstream of p38. Sorbitol, and to a lesser extent, sodium chloride, Taxol, and nocodazole increased TAO2 activity toward itself and kinase-dead MEKs 3 and 6. Activation of endogenous TAO2 during differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts paralleled activation of p38 but not JNK/SAPK, consistent with the idea that TAO2 is a physiological regulator of p38 under certain circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W1485277922,"In pancreatic acinar cells, the HOX-like factor PDX1 acts as part of a trimeric complex with two TALE class homeodomain factors, PBX1b and MEIS2b. The complex binds to overlapping half-sites for PDX1 and PBX. The trimeric complex activates transcription in cells to a level about an order of magnitude greater than PDX1 alone. The N-terminal PDX1 activation domain is required for detectable transcriptional activity of the complex, even though PDX1 truncations bearing only the PDX1 C-terminal homeodomain and pentapeptide motifs can still participate in forming the trimeric complex. The conserved N-terminal PBC-B domain of PBX, as well as its homeodomain, is required for both complex formation and transcriptional activity. Only the N-terminal region of MEIS2, including the conserved MEIS domains, is required for formation of a trimer on DNA and transcriptional activity: the MEIS homeodomain is dispensable. The activity of the pancreas-specific ELA1 enhancer requires the cooperation of the trimer-binding element and a nearby element that binds the pancreatic transcription factor PTF1. We show that the PDX1· PBX1b·MEIS2b complex cooperates with the PTF1 basic helix-loop-helix complex to activate an ELA1 minienhancer in HeLa cells and that this cooperation requires all three homeoprotein subunits, including the PDX1 activation domain.

The many members of this large gene family have distinct roles in development, despite having very similar DNA binding specificities and overlapping patterns of expression. At least part of the increased binding specificity required to distinguish the roles of the various HOX proteins comes from their interaction with members of the TALE class of homeodomain proteins (for review see Ref. 4Mann R.S.

Our previous studies identified the PDX1·PBX1b·MEIS2 trimer as one of two pancreatic transcription factor complexes that cooperate in the transcriptional activation of the ELA1 enhancer in acinar cells (23MacDonald R.J. Swift G.H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 983-994PubMed Google Scholar). The ELA1 enhancer comprises three functional elements (A, B, and C) within 100 bp1 (24Rose S.D. Kruse F. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2048-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The proper acinar activity of the enhancer requires the synergistic cooperation between the A and B elements (25Swift G.H. Kruse F. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E.

The other factor, PTF1, is a bHLH acinar cell-specific complex that binds and mediates the activity of the A element (24Rose S.D. Kruse F. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Mol. Cell.

In this report, we show which domains of PDX1, PBX1b, and MEIS2b are essential for the formation of the trimeric complex, for binding of the complex to DNA, for transcriptional activity, and for cooperative activation with PTF1. PDX1 contributes the only transcriptional activation domain, even though the activity of the trimer is an order of magnitude greater than that of PDX1 alone. PDX1 recruits PBX1b, and they bind in tandem to adjacent PDX1 and PBX half-sites. PBX1b recruits MEIS2b to the DNA-bound complex. MEIS2b is required for both the transcriptional activity of the PDX1·PBX1b·MEIS2 trimer and its cooperation with PTF1. The ELAI B element has been described previously (10Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); the top strand sequences of the B element and its derivatives B2 and B7 are shown in Fig. 1 A. The CRS1 element from the bovine CYP17 gene has the top strand sequence of CCTCGAGACGTTGATGGACAGTGAGCAAGG, and the bottom strand sequence of TCGACCTTGCTCACTGTCCATCAACGTCTCGAGGAGCT; the adjoining PBX and MEIS binding sites are underlined(30Bischof L.J.

Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against PDX1, PBX, PBX1, and MEIS2 have been described previously (10Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific for the a and b isoforms of MEIS2 proteins were raised against an 18-amino acid peptide, PMSGMGMNMGMDGQWHYM, corresponding to amino acids 377–394 of MEIS2b. Similarly, a 16-amino acid peptide, SVDPNVGGQVMDIHAQ, spanning amino acids 455–470 of MEIS2d, was used to produce the anti-MEIS2c/d. A 7-amino acid insert, GFLLDPS, corresponding to amino acids 346–352 of MEIS2a and MEIS2c, is specifically present in these two isoforms. The antibody αMEIS2a/c was raised against a 14-amino acid peptide containing a tandem repeat of the insert. All of the MEIS isoform-specific antibodies were raised against peptide sequences common to mouse and human orthologues. The B element reporter construct (5B.EIp.hGH) has five head-to-tail copies of the B element (Fig.1 A) linked to the Ela1 minimal promoter from −92 to +8 and fused to an hGH reporter gene (10Swift G.H.

In the B2 and B7 multimer constructs, sense strand and antisense strand oligonucleotides containing five copies of the B2 or B7 elements (Fig. 1 A) were annealed and cloned into the Ela1 minimal promoter/hGH reporter plasmid. The mini-enhancer construct 3(BA).EIp.hGH (26Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4385-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) has three head-to-tail copies of adjacent B and A elements (PDX1·PBX1b·MEIS2b and PTF1 binding sites, respectively) from theEla1 gene inserted in front of the Ela1 promoter. The Pdx1.luciferase reporter plasmid, used as an internal control in RIN1046–38 cell transfections, has 4.5 kb of 5′-flanking sequence from the Mus musculus Pdx1 gene (GenBank™ accession number AF192495; a gift of Dr. Chris Wright, Nashville, TN) inserted upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL3basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The deletion series of PDX1, PBX1b, and MEIS2b were created by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the corresponding coding regions and cloning of the fragments into expression vectors. The full-length and PDX1 deletion cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5/His TOPO (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA). The encoded PDX1 proteins contain V5 and His epitope tags at their C termini. To synthesize the PBX1b deletion series by in vitrotranscription and translation (IVT), the cDNAs were cloned into FLAG-pSP65, thereby adding a FLAG-tag at the N terminus of each protein. Each PBX1b cDNA, together with the N-terminal FLAG-tag, was transferred into pcDNA1.1/Amp (Invitrogen) for expression in transfected cells. The MEIS2b deletion series was cloned into pET-28b (Novagen, Madison, WI) under the control of the T7 promoter for IVT. Tandem His and T7 epitope tags were included at the N terminus of each MEIS2b protein. For expression in transfected cells, the MEIS2b cDNAs, together with the His and T7 tags, were transferred into pcDNA1.1/Amp. An IVT expression plasmid for MEIS2d was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of Meis2d cDNA using Meis2d/pBS.SK− (a gift of Professor Pierre Chambon, CNRS-INSERM, Strasbourg, France) as template, and the insert was cloned into pET-28b. The cDNA for the mouse p48 subunit of PTF1 (a gift of Dr. Scott Rose, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas) and the cDNA for HEB (a gift of Dr. Richard Baer, New York, NY) were transferred to pcDNA1.1/Amp for transfection experiments. Procedures for preparing nuclear extracts, in vitro translation (IVT), EMSA, and antibody supershift assays have been described previously (10Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In all EMSA reactions containing nuclear extract from 266–6 cells, a GATA binding site oligonucleotide βG1 (31Swift G.H. Rose S.D. MacDonald R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12809-12815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to compete with GATA4 binding to the B or mutant B elements. IVT proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min prior to the standard EMSA protocol. Western blot analyses were conducted as previously described (10Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 30 μg of nuclear extracts, or 0.25 μl of the rabbit reticulocyte lysates containing the IVT proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford MA). Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with Supersignal West (Pierce, Inc., Rockford, IL). The exocrine cell lines were: 266-6 (ATCC CRL-2151) (32Ornitz D.M. Hammer R.E.

Invest. 1987; 79: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of the PBX and MEIS proteins was performed as follows. 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing equimolar amounts of35S-labeled IVT protein and the unlabeled IVT partner was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. 5 μl of polyclonal antibody specific for the non-labeled protein was added, and the reaction volume was increased to 300 μl by adding buffer containing 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm EDTA. After gentle mixing by rotation at 4 °C for 1 h, 20 μl of protein A beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the mixing was continued overnight. Following the incubation, the beads were collected and washed, then resuspended in SDS-gel loading buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the35S-labeled IVT proteins were detected with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Santa Clara, CA). Transfections of the RIN1046-38 β-cell line (RIN-38) (36Phillipe J. Chick W.L. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) were performed with FuGene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the plasmids for the expression of transcription factors, as well as the β-galactosidase internal control plasmid (pCMVβ, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) utilized the CMV enhancer/promoter. All transfections contained the same total amount of CMV enhancer/promoter, balanced as necessary by the addition of insertless CMV vector (e.g.pcDNA1.1/Amp). The activity of the hGH reporter gene was assayed by radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). Transfections of HeLa cells were corrected for relative efficiency based on the activity of the cotransfected β-galactosidase reporter assayed with a Galacto-Light Plus kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Transfections of RIN1046-38 cells were corrected for relative efficiency based on the activity of a cotransfected Pdx1.luciferase reporter, in which the luciferase reporter gene was under the transcriptional control of the Pdx1 gene promoter sequence. Luciferase activity was assayed with a kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Transfection results reported are the mean and standard error of a minimum of four transfections, except as noted. For those deletion plasmids of PDX1, PBX1b, and MEIS2b that had significantly less than wild type activity in transfections, we confirmed the production of protein and its nuclear localization by immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies recognizing their peptide tags (PDX1 with anti-V5, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; PBX1b with anti-FLAG, Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO; MEIS2b with anti-T7, Novagen, Madison, WI). All were expressed and localized to the nucleus at approximately wild type levels, except for PDX116–206, which was found only in the cytoplasm (data not shown). We previously identified a trimeric homeoprotein complex that binds to and mediates the activity of the B element of the elastase I (ELA1) enhancer in pancreatic acinar cell lines (10Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The complex consists of a pancreatic HOX-like protein, PDX1, and two TALE-class homeodomain proteins, PBX1b and an isoform of MEIS2/MRG1. The trimeric complex binds an 11-bp region of the B element containing overlapping half-sites for PDX1 and PBX but no recognizable site for MEIS (Fig. 1 A). Mutations in either the PDX1 or PBX half-site eliminate trimer binding (10Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The central role of PDX1 in trimer binding was demonstrated by mutation of a single nucleotide in the PDX1 half-site of the B element (the A at position 7 of the PBX-HOX consensus): neither PDX1 nor the PDX1-containing trimeric complex from 266-6 acinar cell nuclear extracts bound detectably to the oligonucleotide containing this A to C transversion (B7, Fig. 1 B) and this B7 oligonucleotide was unable to compete for trimer binding in EMSA competition assays (Fig. 1 C). These results confirmed the binding of PDX1 to its half-site and demonstrated that the formation of the trimeric complex is dependent on an intact PDX1 half-site. To be able to study the structure of the trimeric complex, it was necessary to increase the PBX binding affinity of the B element without altering the qualitative nature of the activity of the element in cells. The binding affinity is low, because nucleotides at positions 1, 2, and 6 differ from the consensus binding sequence for PBX/HOX heterodimers (37Chan S.-K. Mann R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5223-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 38Chang C.-P. Shen W.-F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Changing the A at position 2 to T matches the consensus PBX half-site (B2, Fig. 1 A) and increased the binding of the trimeric complex from acinar cell nuclear extracts without affecting the binding of the PDX1 monomer (Fig.1 B). In competition assays the B2 element was ∼5-fold more effective than the unmodified B element (Fig. 1 C). Antisera specific for PDX1, PBX, and MEIS2 eliminated the B and B2 complexes with equal effectiveness (Fig. 1 D), confirming that the homeodomain protein composition is the same for the two complexes. The transcriptional activities of B and B2 in transfected cells were also qualitatively the same (see Fig. 4, below). We subsequently used the more effective B2 element to test the ability of various forms of the three transcription factors to form complexes on DNA and activate transcription. To determine which of four MEIS2 isoforms are present in the trimeric complex, we developed antisera against distinguishing peptide regions of the isoforms. Four alternatively spliced variants of Meis2 mRNA encode four distinct protein products: 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d (39Oulad-Abdelghani M. Chazaud C. Bouillet P. Sapin V. Chambon P. Dolle P. Dev.

MEIS2a and 2b have a different C-terminal tail (18 amino acids) than MEIS2c and 2d (94 amino acids); MEIS2a and 2c share a common seven amino acid insert, GFLLDPS, which MEIS2b and 2d lack. The antiserum specific for MEIS2a/b supershifted most of the trimeric complex from acinar cell extracts, leaving behind a residual complex of slightly slower electrophoretic mobility (Fig.2 A, lane 3). The antiserum specific for MEIS2c/d decreased the amount of the trimeric complex slightly (lane 5 versus lane 4), although a supershifted band was not observed. Antiserum against the MEIS2a/c-specific heptapeptide did not reduce the amount of the trimeric complex more than the preimmune serum (lanes 6and 7). These results indicate that MEIS2b and possibly MEIS2d are present in the complex, but MEIS2a and 2c are not. To determine whether the residual slower mobility complex remaining after treatment with αMEIS2a/b antiserum contained MEIS2d, nuclear extract was treated with a mixture of αMEIS2a/b and αMEIS2c/d antisera (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). The combination eliminated all of the trimeric complex. In contrast, combining αMEIS2a/b and αMEIS2a/c did not eliminate the slower migrating complex (lane 6), further showing that MEIS2c is not in the trimeric complex. PDX1, PBX1b, and MEIS2 proteins synthesized by translation in vitro can form trimeric complexes on DNA (Fig. 2 B,lanes 7 and 8). The complex formed with recombinant PDX1·PBX1b·MEIS2b comigrates with the predominant trimer from 266-6 acinar cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 7), whereas the PDX1·PBX1b·MEIS2d complex (lane 8) comigrates with the slower mobility complex that remains after αMEIS2b treatment. Thus, we conclude that the major molecular form of the acinar trimeric complex comprises PDX1, PBX1b, and MEIS2b and that MEIS2d replaces MEIS2b in a small fraction of the complexes. The presence of MEIS2b and 2d in acinar cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). Unlike PBX1b, which is present in pancreatic acinar but not β-cell lines (10Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the MEIS2 proteins were detected in nuclear extracts from both. The levels of the MEIS2 proteins were lower in β-cells than in acinar cells. Multimers of the B element are transcriptionally active in the β-cell line RIN1046-38 (RIN-38), due to the presence of endogenous PDX1 in these cells (10Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). PBX1 is absent in these β-cells (10Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and MEIS2 is present at extremely low levels (Fig. 3). Adding either PBX1b or MEIS2b to the β-cell line by transfection had little or no effect on the activity of the B multimer or on the B element with the augmented PBX1b binding site (B2) (Fig.4 A). Co-expression of PBX1b and MEIS2b in RIN-38 β-cells increased the activity of either the B or B2 multimer severalfold over the activity directed by the endogenous PDX1 (7-fold for the B element; 4-fold for the B2 element). These results indicate that the trimer complex is more transcriptionally active in RIN-38 cells than PDX1 alone. The B7 mutation which eliminated PDX1 and trimer binding in EMSA had no activity in the β-cell line, whether in the presence or absence of cotransfected PBX1b and MEIS2b (Fig. 4 A), confirming the central importance of PDX1 binding to the activity of this element. PDX1 contains three important functional domains (Fig. 5 A): an activation domain (AD) at the N terminus (amino acid residues 1–79), a pentapeptide motif (PP; residues 121–125) that directly contacts PBX, and the homeodomain (HD) (residues 145–206) (9Peers B.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3987-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A cryptic C-terminal activation domain also functions in the transcriptional activation of the somatostatin gene by PDX1 (40Lu M. Miller C. Habener J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2959-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We constructed a series of PDX1 deletion mutants to test the function of each domain in the context of the trimer (Fig. 5 A). The mutant proteins were synthesized by in vitro translation (IVT), and their ability to bind DNA was assayed by EMSA. Full-length PDX1 binds to the B2 element as a monomer, a heterodimer with PBX1b, and a heterotrimer with PBX1b and MEIS2b (Fig.5 B, lane 2). PDX1 mutants missing the regions C-terminal to the HD or N-terminal to the PP motif had similar DNA binding activities as the wild type PDX1 (lanes 3,4, and 6). When the PP motif was also deleted, however, the protein was unable to form heterodimeric and heterotrimeric complexes on DNA (lane 5). Therefore, only the DNA-binding domain and the PBX-interaction motif are required for PDX1 to participate fully in forming the trimeric complex on DNA. These are the same domains required for dimer formation with PBX1 (Fig.5 B and Ref. 9Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell.

In vivo, SAP90 tightly binds kainate receptor subunits, while SAP97 is only weakly associated, suggesting that this glutamate receptor differentially associates with SAP90/PSD-95 family members. Here, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged chimeras and deletion mutants of SAP97 and SAP90 were employed to define the molecular mechanism underlying their differential association with kainate receptors. Our results show that a weak interaction between GluR6 and the PDZ1 domain of SAP97 can account for the weak association of GluR6 with the full-length SAP97 observed in vivo. Expression studies in HEK293 cells andin vitro binding studies further show that although the individual Src homology 3 and guanylate kinase domains in SAP97 can interact with the C-terminal tail of KA2 subunit, specific intramolecular interactions in SAP97 (e.g. the SAP97 N terminus (S97N) binding to the Src homology 3 domain) interfere with KA2 binding to the full-length molecule. Because receptor subunits are known to segregate to different parts of the neuron, our results imply that differential association of kainate receptors with SAP family proteins may be one mechanism of subcellular localization.

Clustering of ionotropic glutamate receptors as well as the formation of macromolecular signaling complexes with synaptic receptors is believed to involve a class of synapse-associated proteins (SAPs)1 that are members of a superfamily of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (1Kennedy M.B.

Four members of this family have been described: SAP90/PSD-95, SAP97, SAP102, and chapsyn-110/PSD-93. All four are composed of three PDZ domains (PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3), an Src homology 3 domain (SH3), and a catalytically inactive guanylate kinase (GUK) domain (3Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

Each domain has been shown to be a site of protein-protein interaction, allowing SAP90/PSD-95 family members to interact with ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal proteins as well as proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways (2Garner C.C.

In isolation, analogous domains from each family member have been shown to exhibit similar binding specificities, yetin vivo the full-length molecules are differentially distributed and selectively associate with specific subclasses of ionotropic glutamate receptors. For example, SAP90/PSD-95, SAP102, and chapsyn-110/PSD-93 are all found highly concentrated at and tightly bound to the postsynaptic density (PSD) of type 1 glutamatergic synapses, where they are known to associate with subunits of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and kainate receptors (7Muller B.M.

In contrast, SAP97, which is less tightly associated with these synapses, interacts preferentially with α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (11Leonard A.S.

Differences between SAP97 and the other SAPs are also observed in transfected HEK293 (9Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M.

Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), SAP97 traps these channels intracellularly in an endoplasmic reticulum-like compartment (12Tiffany A.M.

Given their striking structural similarities, these observations raise the important issue of how SAP family members differentially select their binding partners. Recent studies point to at least two types of mechanisms governing the selection process. The first appears to involve small differences in the sequences flanking the conserved PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains. For example, sequences N-terminal to the first PDZ domain in SAP90/PSD-95 and SAP97 (S90N and S97N, respectively) have been found responsible for the differential localization of these two proteins in neurons (14El-Husseini A.E.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The second mechanism appears to involve a series of intramolecular interactions between the individual domains (17McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which in turn regulate both GKAP binding to the GUK domain of SAP97 (18Wu H. Reissner C.

Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, kainate receptors are heteromeric receptors composed of various combinations of GluR5, GluR6, GluR7, KA1, or KA2 subunits (20Seeburg P.H. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar,21Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we found that SAP90 binds the kainate receptor subunits, GluR6 and KA2 (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In contrast, the SAP97 fails to interact with KA2 and only weakly binds GluR6 (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Studies on heteromeric GluR6/KA2 receptors also revealed that SAP90/PSD-95 can associate via its PDZ1 domain with the C-terminal ETMA sequence of the GluR6 subunit and the C terminus of KA2 subunits via its SH3 and GUK domains (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Importantly, these interactions cause reduced desensitization of kainate receptors (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To understand better the molecular bases of SAP binding partner specificity, we have evaluated what structural features in SAP97 are functionally important for interfering with its association with kainate receptor subunits in vivo. Our results show that GluR6 association with SAP97 is feeble due to a weak interaction between the PDZ1 and GluR6 subunit. In contrast, we also find that although both the SH3 and the GUK domain in SAP97 can interact with KA2, a combination of intrinsic features in SAP97 interfere with its ability to interact with KA2. Specifically, intramolecular interactions between the N terminus of SAP97 and its SH3 domain play a dominant role in preventing its binding to the kainate receptor KA2 subunit. The subcloning of cDNAs encoding SAP97 and SAP90 into eukaryotic expression vectors with an N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag has been described previously (16Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SAP90 with a C-terminal GFP tag was created by cloning the coding region of SAP90 into the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). The SAP97 molecules in which specific subdomains such as the I3 (ΔI3), S97N (ΔS97N), PDZ1–3 (ΔPDZ1–3), and SH3(ΔSH3) domains are deleted have been described (16Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFP-PDZ1S90 and GFP-PDZ1S97 were constructed by subcloning polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments directionally into the EcoRI–SalI sites of pEGFP-C2. Single amino acid changes in the SH3 domain of SAP90 were generated by the QuickChange protocol (Stratagene). The cDNAs encoding KA2 and GluR6 (kindly provided by Dr. S. Heinemann) were subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (37 °C, 5% CO2) and transiently transfected as described (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In brief, HEK293 cells grown in 75-mm2flasks were transfected at 30–40% confluence using LipofectAMINE according to manufacturers' recommendations (Life Technologies, Inc.). When two plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293 cells (e.g. KA2 and SAP97), a 1:1 ratio was used. For immunoprecipitation experiments, fresh adult rat brains were homogenized and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 165,000 × g. Insoluble pellets were dissolved in radioimmune precipitation buffer with 2% SDS. Solubilized extracts were passed several times through a 25-gauge needle, diluted to a final SDS concentration of 0.33%, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. Transfected cell extracts were prepared in a similar fashion, except 0.1% SDS was used in the solubilization buffer. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating extracts with 5 μg of anti-KA2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 5 μg of anti-GluR1 (Upstate Biotechnology), or 5 μg of anti-GFP (Quantum Biotechnology) antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 12–16 h and four washes in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Western blot analysis of the depleted cell extracts showed no detectable anti-KA2, anti-GluR1, or anti-GFP immunoreactivity, suggesting that immunoprecipitation was complete. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were then blotted and immunostained as previously described (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used for Western blotting included mouse monoclonal anti-SAP90 (1:250; Transduction Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal anti-GST (1:1000; Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-SAP97 (1:2000;Stressgen), mouse monoclonal anti-T7 (1:10,000; Novagen), rabbit polyclonal anti-GluR1 (1 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-KA2 (1 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology), and rabbit polyclonal anti-GluR6 (1 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology). H6KA2(c-term) expressed in pTrcHisB (Invitrogen) was prepared as described by Garcia et al. (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). H6S97N was prepared by subcloning the polymerase chain reaction fragment containing amino acids 1–104 of SAP97 in pRSETC vector (Invitrogen). Synthesis of recombinant proteins in TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12–14 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested, resuspended in 50 mmphosphate buffer (pH 8.0) with 300 mm NaCl and 8m urea, lysed by French press as directed by the manufacturer (SLM Instruments, Inc.), and centrifuged at 70,000 ×g for 25 min at 20 °C. Supernatant containing H6KA2(c-term) was bound to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at room temperature with mixing and then loaded into a column. After washing, bound H6KA2(c-term) was eluted using an imidazole step gradient from 50 to 500 mm and then dialyzed in a series of buffers with decreasing urea concentrations (from 6 to 1m) to renature the protein and remove the imidazole. GST fusion proteins of specific regions of SAP90 and SAP97 were constructed by subcloning polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments directionally into the EcoRI–SalI sites of pGEX-4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Vectors expressing GST-SAP90 fusion proteins contained the SAP90 cDNA sequence encoding the following amino acids: GST-SH3S90 (residues 402–500), GST-GUKS90 (residues 521–724), or GST-SG90 (residues 402–724). The GST-SAP97 fusion proteins contained the following amino acids: GST-SH3S97 (residues 554–653), GST-GUKS97 (residues 727–911), or GST-SG97 (residues 554–911). Recombinant proteins were prepared and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined with a Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). For each sample, 800 pmol of H6KA2(c-term) or H6S97N were incubated with 200 pmol of GST fusion proteins in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A in phosphate-buffered saline) containing 10 mm EDTA and 40 mm imidazole. After 6–8 h of continuous rotation at 4 °C, 25 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose beads were added. Samples were then incubated for 1 h and washed four times, and bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 500 mmimidazole. The eluted proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed for GST, and visualized by chemiluminesence as directed by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In competition experiments, 200 pmol of H6KA2 were incubated with 50 pmol of GST fusion proteins and 0–1600 pmol of H6S97N in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A in phosphate-buffered saline) containing 10 mmEDTA and 40 mm imidazole. The samples were processed as above, blotted, and probed using anti-KA2 antibodies (0.05 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology). To compare the bindings of SH3S90and SH3S90(W-A) to H6KA2 and H6S97N, 400 pmol of H6KA2(c-term) or H6S97N were incubated with 200 pmol of GST-SH3 fusion proteins in phosphate-buffered saline with 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 40 mm imidazole. After 6–8 h of continuous rotation at 4 °C, 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were added, and samples were incubated and washed as above, with elution in 50 μl of 10 mmglutathione. In our previous study, co-immunoprecipitations from rat brain extracts showed that the GluR6 and KA2 subunits of kainate receptors associated with SAP90 (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These experiments also showed a weak association between GluR6 and SAP97 and no association between KA2 and SAP97. Given the striking sequence homology between SAP90 and SAP97, this result was unexpected and raised the possibility that either SAP97 and kainate receptors do not coexist in the same subcellular compartments or that the structure of SAP97 is subtly different from SAP90, preventing its association with kainate receptors. To evaluate the first possibility, GluR6 or KA2 subunits were co-expressed with GFP-tagged SAP90 or SAP97 in HEK293 cells. After solubilization, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-KA2 or anti-GFP antibodies, and the immunoprecipitated products, separated by SDS-PAGE, were probed with antibodies against SAP90, SAP97, or GluR6 (Fig. 1). Similar to our previous results using rat brain extracts, both the GluR6 and KA2 subunits interacted with SAP90, while GluR6 interacted weakly with SAP97 (Fig. 1,left) and no detectable interaction was seen between KA2 and SAP97 (Fig. 1, right). These results indicate that even when SAP97 and kainate receptors are co-expressed in HEK293 cells, they do not interact, suggesting that structural differences between SAP90 and SAP97 may be responsible for their selective interaction with kainate receptors. Previously, we showed that SAP90 binding to GluR6 is mediated via its PDZ1 domain (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although sequence alignment of the PDZ1 domain of SAP90 and SAP97 indicates about 90% identity, subtle change(s) in the amino acid sequence(s) of PDZ1 could be responsible for the selective interaction of SAPs with GluR6. To evaluate this possibility, we co-expressed GFP-tagged PDZ1 domains from SAP90 or SAP97 (GFP-PDZ1S90 and GFP-PDZ1S97) with the GluR6 subunit in HEK293 cells. Co-immunoprecipitations reveal that the GluR6 subunit binds well to GFP-PDZ1S90 and weakly to GFP-PDZ1S97 (Fig.2 A, left). This demonstrates that the amino acid sequence of the PDZ1 domain of SAPs is critical for its selective binding to GluR6. SAP97 has also been shown to interact with the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors (11Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and it has been speculated that the interaction is mediated via PDZ domains (11Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 22Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). In order to show that GFP-PDZ1S97 forms a functional domain, we co-expressed it with the GluR1 subunit. Immunoprecipitation with the anti-GluR1 antibody reveals that GluR1 binds well to the GFP-PDZ1S97(Fig. 2 B, right). Taken together, these data suggest that the PDZ1 domain of SAPs is an important determinant for their differential interaction with GluR6. SAP90 binds to the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of KA2 via its SH3 and GUK domains (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although the SH3 domains are not well conserved between SAP90 and SAP97, GUK domains share a high degree of sequence identity (23Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were therefore curious whether the SH3 and GUK domains of SAP97 could interact with C terminus of KA2. This was addressed by utilizing a “pull down” assay with several segments from the C-terminal half of SAP97 and SAP90, including the SH3 (GST-SH3S97 and GST-SH3S90), GUK (GST-GUKS97 and GST-GUKS90), or contiguous SH3 and GUK domains (GST-SG97 and GST-SG90) fused to GST and the C terminus of KA2 expressed with a histidine (H6) tag (H6KA2). The purity of each recombinant purified protein used in this assay was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Each exhibited a single band after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue except for the GST-SH3S90 and GST-SH3S97 proteins (Fig.3, lower gel), which are subject to some degradation in Escherichia coli. In our pull down assay, GST fusion proteins were incubated in solution with H6KA2 and then Ni2+ beads to bind out H6KA2 and any interacting GST fusion proteins. Bound proteins were eluted, immunoblotted, and probed with an anti-GST antibody. Based on the relative amounts of the GST fusion protein detected after immunoblotting (Fig. 3, upper panel), the SH3 domain of SAP97 (SH3S97) appears to have a higher affinity for KA2 than the SH3 domain of SAP90 (SH3S90). The GUK domains of both SAP97 (GUKS97) and SAP90 (GUKS90) bind equally well to KA2. Given that the SH3 and GUK domains of SAPs bind to KA2 in a similar manner, we would conclude that the inability of KA2 to bind full-length SAP97 is not due to deficiency in SH3 and/or GUK binding. Previous studies (17McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that the inability to bind KA2 may involve sequences that either directly flank the SH3 or GUK domains, sequences upstream of the SH3 domain, or intramolecular interactions either between the SH3 and GUK domains or with other regions in SAP97. To address whether an SH3-GUK intramolecular interaction affected KA2 binding, we assessed KA2 binding to the GST-fused SH3-GUK proteins from both SAP90 and SAP97 (GST-SG90 and GST-SG97). KA2 was able to bind SG90 and SG97, albeit at a slightly lower level than SH3 alone, indicating that this intramolecular interaction is not important for the differential binding of KA2 to SAP90 versus SAP97. These data suggest that some other sequence elements unique to SAP97 must interfere with KA2 binding. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of SAP97 and SAP90 reveals that the N-terminal region preceding the first PDZ domain (S97N and S90N, respectively) and the sequence situated between the SH3 and GUK domains (U5 region) are the most divergent (18Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the amino terminus of SAP97 is 187 amino acids in length and, based on molecular modeling, can be folded into two fibronectin-like domains, while the region containing 63 amino acids in the N terminus of SAP90 has an unordered structure (18Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similarly, the U5 region of SAP97 is longer than that found in SAP90 and can have short insert sequences of 1–33 amino acids that arise from alternative splicing. The most predominantly expressed form of SAP97 used in these studies contains the I3 insert (18Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that differences in the primary structure of SAP97 might govern its unusual behavior. To test this possibility, we assessed the ability of several GFP-tagged SAP97 deletion constructs (Fig.4 A) to interact with KA2 subunits expressed in HEK293 cells. GFP-tagged SAP97 deletion mutants included constructs in which the N terminus (SAP97ΔS97N), PDZ1–3 (SAP97ΔPDZ1–3), SH3 (SAP97ΔSH3), I3 (SAP97ΔI3), or GUK (SAP97ΔGUK) domains were deleted. Full-length chimeras in which the S90N was replaced by the S97N (S97N/S90PDZ1-GUK) or the GUKS90 domain for the GUKS97 domain in SAP97 (SAP97N-I3/S90GUK) were also tested. A GFP tag that does not affect SAP97's biological activity (16Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to follow the protein expression levels and to monitor transfection efficiencies. The results from Fig. 4 B show that SAP97 constructs with deleted PDZ, I3, or GUK domains do not bind to immunoprecipitated KA2, suggesting that inhibitory elements are absent in these regions. In contrast, deleting the S97N region was found to permit KA2 binding, indicating that this domain inhibits the interaction with KA2. Interestingly, a construct lacking the SH3 domain showed a weak interaction with KA2. Since KA2 can interact with both the SH3 and GUK domains of SAP97, weak association of SAP97ΔSH3 with KA2 is likely to be via the GUK domain. As anticipated, the lack of interaction between chimeric SAP97N-I3/S90GUK and KA2 indicates that conservative GUK domain replacement has no effect on SAP97-KA2 binding. These observations suggest that the S97N exerts an inhibitory affect on the interaction of SAP97 with KA2. The finding that the N terminus of SAP97 prevents its association with KA2 suggests that an intramolecular interaction between the N terminus and SH3 and/or GUK domains of SAP97 may prevent KA2 interaction. Given that the C terminus of KA2 interacts with SH3 via PXXP motifs (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), S97N, which also has several proline-rich sequences containing PXXP motifs, could potentially bind to its own SH3 domain. We tested this by employing an in vitro binding assay using the histidine-tagged recombinant N terminus of SAP97 (H6S97N) and GST-fusion proteins. As described above, binding to H6S97N was done in solution, and the ability of GST-fusion proteins to interact with H6S97N was identified using Western blots. We find that H6S97N binds to the SH3S97 and SG97 domains but not to the GUKS97domain (Fig. 5). Since the N terminus of SAP97 appears to block its binding to KA2 by intramolecular interaction with its SH3 domain, we speculated that replacement of the N terminus of SAP90 with S97N would result in a chimera (S97N/S90PDZ1-GUK) that is structurally similar to SAP97 and would not associate with KA2. Surprisingly, our results show that the S97N/S90PDZ1-GUK chimera can interact with KA2 (Fig. 4 B). To investigate this unexpected finding, we compared the binding of S97N to SH3 and SG proteins from SAP90 and SAP97. As shown in Fig. 5, H6S97N binds much better to SH3 and SG proteins from SAP97 than SAP90, indicating that a weaker intramolecular interaction between the S97N and SH3 may allow KA2 binding to the S97N/S90PDZ1-GUK. KA2 can interact with both the SH3 and the GUK domains of SAP97in vitro (Fig. 3 B). However, in full-length SAP97, both of the binding sites appear to be occluded. The higher affinity binding site on the SH3 domain appears to be masked by an intramolecular association between S97N and SH3, while the lower affinity binding site on the GUK domain seems to be blocked by interaction between the SH3 and GUK domains. This theory is further supported by the binding of KA2 to the SAP97 with either its N terminus or SH3 domain deleted (Fig. 4 B). Together, the data suggest that intramolecular interactions between the S97N-SH3 and SH3-GUK domains of SAP97 are strong enough to prevent any KA2 binding to SAP97. Our results indicate that in vivo S97N binding to SH3 may prevent KA2 association with SAP97. In other words, the effective intramolecular binding of SH3 to the S97N appears to be stronger than intermolecular KA2 binding. To evaluate this, we performed an in vitro in-solution competition assay. Recombinant GST-SH3S97 or GST-SG97 (50 pmol) were incubated with 200 pmol of H6KA2 and varying amounts (0–1600 pmol) of H6S97N. After overnight incubation, glutathione beads were added, and specific binding of H6KA2 to the GST-fusion proteins was assessed. As shown in Fig.6 A, increasing concentrations of H6S97N can progressively compete H6KA2 binding to SH3S90 and SG97. Since the intramolecular binding between the SH3 and GUK domains slightly lowers the binding of KA2 to the SH3 domain, results from this experiment consistently show that binding of H6KA2 is stronger to SH3S97, as compared with SG97 (Figs. 3 and 6 A). As a result, lower concentrations of H6S97N are required to compete off H6KA2 binding to SG97 than SH3S90 (Fig.6 A). Our data support the hypothesis that this type of competition exists in vivo and that intramolecular interactions (between S97N and SH3S97) interfere with intermolecular interactions (between KA2 and SH3S97). However, these results do not indicate whether H6S97N and H6KA2 bind to the same site or distinct but overlapping sites on SH3. We reported earlier (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) that H6KA2 binding to SH3S90 could be blocked by a tryptophan to alanine mutation (at position 470) in SH3, which has also been reported to inhibit other SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions (24Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The potential importance of this site was tested by in vitro binding of GST-SH3 or GST-SH3(W-A) to H6KA2 or H6S97N. The bound complexes were pulled down by Ni2+ beads and probed for GST. We found that H6S97N binds to the mutated SH3 as well as wild type (Fig. 6 B, compare lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, there was minimal binding of H6KA2 to mutated SH3 (Fig. 6 B, comparelanes 2 and 3), indicating that tryptophan is a critical residue for SH3 interaction with KA2 but not with S97N. Because the tryptophan is required for most SH3-ligand interactions (24Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), this suggests that the S97N-SH3 interaction is atypical and that S97N may block the KA2 interaction via steric hindrance. Previous studies indicate that the GluR6 and KA2 subunit of kainate receptors interact strongly with SAP90 and SAP102 (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, while GluR6 weakly associates with SAP97, KA2 does not. These unusual findings prompted us to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Since SAP90 and SAP97 are homologous, a weak interaction between SAP97 and GluR6 or no interaction between SAP97 and KA2 could be explained if the kainate receptors and SAP97 had different subneuronal localizations. However, expression of GluR6 and SAP97 or KA2 and SAP97 in a heterologous system gave similar results, suggesting that the level of interaction of SAP97 with kainate receptors is not related to their subcellular distribution. Instead, our data suggest that SAP97 is structurally impaired to interact with kainate receptors and specifically indicate that the PDZ1 domain of SAP97 differs from that of SAP90 in its ability to interact with GluR6: the binding between PDZ1S90 and GluR6 is much higher than binding between PDZ1S97 and GluR6, thus providing an explanation for the reduced interaction between GluR6 and wild-type SAP97. In addition, the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors have been hypothesized to interact with PDZ domains of SAP97 (11Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 22Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). We show here that PDZ1S97can bind to the GluR1 subunit. Earlier reports have shown that the SH3 and the GUK domains mediate KA2 interaction with SAP90 (10Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The sequence of the GUK domain is well conserved between SAP90 and SAP97, as compared with the SH3 domain. Our results indicate that neither the GUK domain nor the SH3 domain of SAP97 is functionally impaired in their capacity to interact with KA2 yet reveal that KA2 does not have access to these sites in full-length SAP97. Although SAP90 and SAP97 are homologous, SAP97 contains an extended N terminus and an insertion in the U5 region between the SH3 and GUK domains. Based on our data indicating that SAP97 lacking S97N binds well to KA2 and thatin vitro the S97N can bind its own SH3 domain, we have identified S97N as the negative element preventing the interaction between KA2 and SAP97. Recent biochemical and structural studies have revealed that S97N association with its own SH3 and U5 regions modulates GKAP binding (18Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5740-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that an interaction between the SAP97 N terminus and SH3 domain occludes binding to KA2. However, since KA2 interacts with both the SH3 and GUK domains, it should be able to interact with SAP97 via the GUK domain. Nonetheless, SAP97 does not interact with KA2 in vivo or in vitro. One possible reason could be that the affinity of KA2 for the GUK domain is about 5-fold less than for the SH3 domain. Alternatively, an SH3-GUK intramolecular interaction may block the GUK binding site for KA2. Based on our results, a SH3-GUK interaction appears to be an important factor, since the SAP97 with deleted SH3 can bind to KA2 with lower affinity. The sequence of the SH3 domain is not well conserved between SAP97 and SAP90. Interestingly, the N terminus of SAP97 binds SH3597and SG97 better than SH3590 and SG90. These in vitro binding data are consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation results from HEK cells transfected with KA2 and a SAP90/SAP97 chimera with an N-terminal replacement of SAP90 with SAP97. The chimeric protein is similar in structure to SAP97 but binds to KA2. Since S97N binds much better to SG97 than SG90, the inhibition by S97N may not be strong enough to ward off KA2. Competition studies show that in vitro S97N can more easily compete KA2 binding to SG97 than SH3S97. From these results, it appears that the presence of a GUK domain contiguous with its SH3 domain has some inhibitory effects on KA2 interaction, possibly due to intramolecular SH3-GUK interactions. SH3 domains are known to interact with proline-rich sequences containing the consensus sequence PXXP (25Weng Z. Rickles R.J. Feng S. Richard S. Shaw A.S. Schreiber S.L. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, binding of a SAP SH3 domain to its GUK domain is an exception (17McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Wu H. Reissner C. Kuhlendahl S. Coblentz B. Reuver S. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), since the GUK does not have any such motif. Our results show that binding of the N terminus of SAP97 to its SH3 may also be atypical. Although the N terminus contains proline-rich sequences and has PXXP motifs, it interacts well with the SH3 containing a W-A mutation, which normally blocks any PXXP-mediated binding to SH3 domains. It is conceivable that the N terminus may still bind to SH3 via its PXXP motifs, but the tryptophan residue is not important. Alternatively, some other sequences at the N terminus maybe required for its interaction with SH3. Nevertheless, our results show that intramolecular interactions between the N terminus of SAP97 and SH3 can deny access of KA2 to its potential binding site (Fig.7). These effects appear to be similar to the ones described for Src and Tec family kinases (27Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 28Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), where intramolecular interactions between the SH3 and catalytic domains cause autoinhibition. However, once an extrinsic ligand binds the SH3 domain, the intermolecular interaction interferes with the intramolecular interaction, freeing the catalytic domain and making it active. It is conceivable that a high affinity ligand for the N terminus of SAP97 may exist in vivo to shift SAP97 into a more open state, exposing its SH3 domain and making it available to bind KA2. Potentially, any resultant binding might be too transient to be detected by standard co-immunoprecipitation or immunocytochemical assays. Alternatively, SAP97 intramolecular interactions could be part of a basic molecular mechanism used by cells to allow the differential association of SAPs with binding partners.

Aminoglycosides act first by disrupting protein expression and interfering with translation at the level of appropriate aminoacyl-tRNA recognition at the ribosomal A site; this is followed by a series of secondary effects, including membrane damage, which combine to arrest growth and kill the cell (1Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Mobashery S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 456: 27-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The ribosomal receptor for most aminoglycoside antibiotics, including gentamicin C, kanamycin, and neomycin, is the 16 S rRNA of the 30 S subunit. The location of aminoglycoside binding site has been inferred by chemical footprinting analyses (2Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 27: 389-394Crossref Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 3Woodcock J.

These studies suggest a tight complex between rings I and II of the aminoglycosides with the rRNA and highlight important interactions between conserved aminoglycoside amino and hydroxyl functional groups and the nucleic acids. Given the close fit between drug and target, it is not surprising that bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that decorate the aminoglycosides by covalent modification resulting in disruption of the complexes with a consequent decrease in ribosome affinity (7Wright G.D. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8Shaw K.J. Rather P.N. Hare R.S. Miller G.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 138-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes are widely distributed among bacterial pathogens and include O-phosphoryltransferases (kinases), N-acetyltransferases, andO-adenyltransferases. The aminoglycoside kinases (abbreviated APH)1 include a number of enzymes with differing aminoglycoside substrate specificities and regiospecificities of phosphoryl transfer. Despite this broad tolerance for aminoglycoside substrates, all APHs share a common active site motif that resembles the active site residues found in the Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinase superfamily (9Wright G.D. Thompson P.R. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D9-D21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This similarity mirrors the three-dimensional structural homology between aminoglycoside and protein kinases (10Hon W.C.

In particular, five amino acid residues are 100% conserved between aminoglycoside and protein kinases: Lys44, Glu60, Asp190, Asn195, and Asp208 (APH(3′)-IIIa numbering; see Fig. 2 below).Figure 2The active site of APH (3′)-IIIa.

For example, Lys44 was implicated in ATP binding in APH(3′)-IIIa and is homologous to an invariant Lys in protein kinases with a similar role (10Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M.

Asp190 aligns with an Asp residue widely described in the protein kinase literature as an active site base necessary for deprotonating the incoming nucleophilic hydroxyl, and indeed mutation of Asp190 to Ala in APH(3′)-IIIa has a major impact on catalysis (10Hon W.C.

These studies along with the demonstration that APHs can phosphorylate some protein and peptide substrates (12Daigle D.M. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) support the functional link between aminoglycoside and protein kinases. APH(3′)-IIIa has also been determined to regiospecifically phosphorylate 4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides such as kanamycin and amikacin at the 3′-hydroxyl exclusively and at the 3′- and 5“-hydroxyls of 4,5-disubstituted deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides such as neomycin and ribostamycin (Fig.1) (13Thompson P.R.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8680-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The determination of the structures of APH(3′)-IIIa in complex with various substrates and inhibitors together with the revelation of the structural similarity with Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases has immensely aided our understanding of the mechanism of this enzyme. Guided by studies on the better-characterized protein kinases, we have examined the roles of conserved residues lining the active site of this enzyme and characterized their contribution to catalysis.RESULTSProtease Susceptibility of APH(3′)-IIIaBecause protease sensitivity can be a sensitive marker of changes in protein structure, we examined the susceptibility of APH(3′)-IIIa to various proteases in the presence and absence of substrates in an effort to ensure that changes in the activity of the site mutants were not the result of significant changes in protein conformation. Exposure of the WT enzyme to subtilisin results in the cleavage of the enzyme at positions His78 and Glu157, which are in exposed loop regions (Fig.3 B), as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and addition of tobramycin completely protected against proteolysis whereas addition of ATP alone gave only modest protection (Fig. 3 A). All of the site mutants described in this work showed protease sensitivity that was indistinguishable from the effects on the WT enzyme.Figure 3Partial proteolysis of APH (3′)-IIIa.

Mutation of this residue to Ala resulted in no changes inkcat but had a greater than 5-fold increase inkcat/ Km for ATP (Table II). Furthermore, although kcat/Kmfor aminoglycosides was largely unaffected, greater than 5-fold increases were recorded for amikacin, isepamicin, and butirosin, aminoglycosides substituted at N1. The kanamycin MIC was also reduced to 64 μg/ml, correlating the important role in enzyme activity with the biologically relevant phenotype of drug resistance (Table III).Asp190Asp190 is equivalent to the invariant protein kinase Asp in Hanks' consensus sequence VI that has been ascribed the role of active site base. The Asp190 → Ala mutant of APH(3′)-IIIa has previously been shown to be over 500-fold less active than the WT enzyme (10Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S.C. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To further explore the role of Asp190 in the catalytic mechanism of APH(3′)-IIIa, Asp190 → Glu and Asp190 → Asn mutants were generated. Both mutants were severely impaired in phosphoryl transfer capacity and in most cases only estimates ofkcat were possible (Table II). The importance of Ala190 was also supported by a greater than 32-fold decrease in MIC (Table III).Asp208The crystal structure of APH(3′)-IIIa·ADP demonstrates that Asp208 is a ligand for both Mg1, providing two of the six possible Mg1 coordination positions, and Mg2, providing one coordination ligand (10Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S.C. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and we have previously shown that Asp208 is critical to the protein kinase activity of APH(3′)-IIIa (12Daigle D.M. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); an Asp208 → Ala mutant is at least 1800-fold less active than the WT enzyme. We therefore generated the Asp208 → Asn and the Asp208 → Glu mutants to further probe the role of this residue in enzyme activity. Both mutants lacked any detectable activity above the assay background, underscoring the critical nature of this residue to catalysis. Assessment of the biological activity of the Asp208 mutants was also supportive of an essential role in catalysis with kanamycin A MIC levels indistinguishable from controls containing no APH(3′)-IIIa (Table III).Metal Ion Dependence of WT and Mutant APH(3′)-IIIa ProteinsMg2+ is a required element for APH(3′)-IIIa rate enhancement, and other metal ions, for example Mn2+, do not support catalysis at a concentration of 10 mm (16McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The fact that a number of invariant active site residues are also metal ligands suggested that the active site mutants generated in this study might have altered metal ion dependences. As a first test of this possibility, we examined the ability of the Asn195 → Ala mutant to use Mn2+ as the divalent cation (TableIV). Unlike the WT enzyme, the Asn195 → Ala mutant was quite active in 15 mmMnCl2 (Fig. 4).Table IVM2+ effects on APH(3′)-IIIa-Asn195 → AlaM2+SubstrateKmkcatμms−1MgCl2 (10 mm)ATP4-aKanamycin A was held at 100 μm.114 ± 10.41.70 ± 0.06MgCl2 (10 mm)Kanamycin A4-bATP was held at 1 mm.15.6 ± 2.72.03 ± 0.07MnCl2 (15 mm)ATP4-aKanamycin A was held at 100 μm.12.0 ± 1.40.33 ± 0.02MnCl2 (15 mm)Kanamycin A4-bATP was held at 1 mm.34.3 ± 2.40.44 ± 0.014-a Kanamycin A was held at 100 μm.4-b ATP was held at 1 mm.

Thekcat measured for the Mn2+-catalyzed phosphorylation of kanamycin A was decreased 4.6-fold (Table IV). There is a corresponding decrease in the kcatdetermined when ATP is the variable substrate. A comparison of the rates of reaction determined at 15 mm MnCl2 to those determined at 10 mm MgCl2 is reasonable, because the rate of the Mn2+ catalyzed reaction varies little between 5 and 15 mm MnCl2.We next examined the dependence of initial rates of the WT and Asn195 → Ala enzymes at fixed concentrations of ATP and kanamycin, on both Mg2+ and Mn2+ ion concentration (Fig. 4). The results obtained for the WT enzyme clearly indicate that increasing concentrations of both these metal ions are in fact inhibitory, with the effect being more pronounced when Mn2+ is used as the divalent cation. On the other hand, the lack of inhibition at higher concentrations of divalent cation is striking compared with the Asn195→Ala mutant.The observation that the Asn195 → Ala mutant is not significantly inhibited by high concentrations of Mg2+prompted an investigation of the Mg2+ dependences of the other active site mutants examined in this study. The results from this analysis are presented graphically in Fig.5 and quantitatively in TableV.Figure 5Magnesium ion dependences of APH (3′)-IIIa and mutant proteins.

Open table in a new tab What is most evident from Fig. 5 is the extent to which the WT enzyme is inhibited by high concentrations of Mg2+(Ki = 0.57 ± 0.23 mm), in comparison to the active site mutants described here. The Mg2+ dependence of the Phe264 → Ala mutant (17Thompson P.R. Schwartzenhauer J. Hughes D.W. Berghuis A.M. Wright G.D. J. Biol.

Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8680-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine whether or not proton abstraction was now contributing to the rate, we measured solvent isotope effects (SIEs) for the Asn195 → Ala mutant by performing kinetic experiments in D2O, in the presence of either 10 mm MgCl2 or 15 mmMnCl2 (Table VI). The SIEs on both kcat andkcat/Km were decreased compared with WT, and there was a significant inverse effect onkcat/Km (Table VI).Table VISolvent isotope effects on APH(3′)-IIIa and site mutantsEnzymeVaried substratekcatH/kcatD(kcat/Km)H/(kcat/Km)DWTATP1.79 ± 0.021.18 ± 0.09Kanamycin A1.67 ± 0.030.98 ± 0.07Asn195 → Ala + Mg2+ATP0.90 ± 0.030.60 ± 0.14Kanamycin A1.03 ± 0.040.64 ± 0.21Asn195 → Ala + Mn2+ATP1.10 ± 0.104.61 ± 1.20Kanamycin A1.29 ± 0.151.30 ± 0.37Glu60 → AlaATP1.79 ± 0.031.19 ± 0.09Kanamycin A1.80 ± 0.041.11 ± 0.08 Open table in a new tab In a further effort to compare the rate-limiting step of the Asn195 → Ala mutant to that of the WT enzyme, we examined the solvent viscosity effect (SVE 2SVE is defined as the slope of the relative ratek 0/k versus the relative viscosity of the assay solution. ), using the microviscogen glycerol. Macroviscogen controls using PEG 8000 were also performed and showed no effect as previously reported for the WT enzyme (14McKay G.A. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8680-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The SVE of APH(3′)-IIIa, on both kcat andkcat /Km, is ∼1 (14McKay G.A. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8680-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas the SVE on kcat(ATP) of the Asn195 → Ala mutant, is 0.20 ± 0.06.The SIE and the SVE for the Glu60 → Ala mutant were also determined. The SIE is identical to the effect on the WT enzyme (TableVI). On the other hand, the SVE of this mutant onkcat(ATP) is quite large (2.89 ± 0.12), suggesting that a number of diffusion controlled steps affect the measured rate of the reaction catalyzed by the Glu60 → Ala mutant. The possibility that this result was due to direct inhibition by glycerol was explored by performing the assay using sucrose as microviscogen and here again the SVE was greater than 1 (1.4 ± 0.2).DISCUSSIONElucidation of the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer catalyzed by aminoglycoside kinases and the contribution of specific active site residues is central to efforts to understand antibiotic resistance at the molecular level. The remarkable three-dimensional similarity between Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases and APH(3′)-IIIa suggested the possibility that these enzymes may catalyze phosphoryl transfer in a conserved fashion, and, indeed, of the five invariant amino acids between protein and aminoglycoside kinases, all are located within the active site. In an effort to understand the contribution of APH(3′)-IIIa active site residues to rate enhancement, we have analyzed the effect of mutagenesis of Glu60, Asp190, Asn195, and Asp208, which represent four of the active site amino acids conserved between protein and aminoglycoside kinases. The effects of mutation of the invariant Lys and its role in ATP binding have been reported (10Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S.C. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).Phosphoryl transfer can occur through two extreme mechanisms in which nucleophilic attack either precedes (associative mechanism) or occurs after (dissociative mechanism) leaving group bond breakage (SchemeFS1). The very practical importance of the determination of the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer in aminoglycoside kinase enzymes lies in developing a molecular understanding of transition state structure, which has utility in the design of specific inhibitors. This requires distinguishing between a minimal reaction coordinate distance with overall charge of −3 for a fully associative mechanism and larger reaction coordinate distance with overall charge of −1 for a full metaphosphate-generating dissociative mechanism. However, as has been previously noted (21Mildvan A.S. Proteins. 1997; 29: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), a continuum of mechanisms is possible and most enzymes likely do not adopt either fully associative or dissociative mechanisms but stabilize transition states in which bond breakage or formation predominate but are not complete. One of the goals of these mutagenesis studies was to provide supportive evidence to describe the phosphoryl transfer mechanism of APH(3′)-IIIa.Figure FS1Potential phosphate transfer mechanisms catalyzed by APH (3′)-IIIa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Glu60In a ternary structure model of APH(3′) in complex with ATP and the aminoglycoside ribostamycin (17Thompson P.R.

Glu60 is however interacting with the ATP ligand Lys44 in an arrangement that is conserved in protein kinases (Fig. 2). Therefore, it was predicted that mutation of this residue to Ala was unlikely to exert a direct effect upon aminoglycoside affinity, but that ATP binding could be affected. However, this mutant was not dramatically impaired in substrate affinity, catalysis, or MIC. The"

Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Rapid and processive DNA synthesis by Pol III holoenzyme is dependent on the interaction between the α subunit of the core polymerase and the β clamp (6Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β is a ring-shaped protein that encircles double-stranded DNA and can slide freely along its length (6Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). By itself, core polymerase can extend a primer by only a few nucleotides before dissociating from DNA (16Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When β is bound to the polymerase and topologicaly linked to the primer-template, it serves as a mobile tether to keep the enzyme associated with DNA, facilitating replication of several thousand nucleotides at a time. Similar mechanisms for processive DNA synthesis by replicative polymerases have been discovered in a variety of other organisms (reviewed in Refs. 2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 17Baker T.A. Bell S.P.

O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar)). The crystal structure of β shows it to be a ring-shaped dimer formed by the head-to-tail interaction of two semicircle-shaped monomers (7Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). A continuous β-sheet forms a scaffold around the outer surface of the ring that supports 12 α-helices lining the inside of the ring. The central cavity is about 35 Å in diameter, which is large enough to encircle double-stranded DNA as well as one or two layers of water molecules. Moreover, although the inside of the β ring is positively charged, it lacks specific contact with DNA, allowing β to form a stable topological link with the DNA and yet slide freely along the duplex. At the two identical dimer interfaces, a continuous β-sheet formed by hydrogen bonding between β strands from each monomer stabilizes the ring structure in addition to a small hydrophobic core formed by packing of Ile272 and Leu273 of one monomer with Phe106 and Leu108 on the other monomer. Charged amino acids at the interface are also in position to form six ion pairs (these interactions are detailed in Fig. 4). These numerous and potentially strong interactions between the two β subunits presumably underlie the highly stable dimeric structure of β and its ability to remain bound to DNA with a half-life of over 100 min (23Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Leu F.P. Hingorani M.M. Turner J.

Yet the closed circular clamp must be opened frequently during DNA replication for assembly on DNA to initiate processive replication as well as for disassembly of the β ring from DNA when replication is complete. The γ complex clamp loader (γδδ′χψ) assembles β clamps on primer-template DNA (where they can be used by the polymerase) and can also remove clamps from DNA when necessary (23Yao N. Turner J.

The process of clamp assembly requires that the γ complex open the β clamp, guide DNA into the central cavity, and facilitate closure of the clamp around DNA. Crystal structure analysis, 2The crystal structure of γδδ′ complex has been solved (D. Jeruzalmi and J. Kuriyan, personal communication). The stoichiometry is γ3δ1δ′1, and the five subunits form a pentameric ring. and a recent biochemical study (27Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reveals that the γ complex contains three copies of γ; the other subunits (δ, δ′, χ, ψ) are each present in a single copy (10Dallmann H.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The δ subunit of γ complex binds to β and destabilizes or opens the dimer interface (28Naktinis V.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The γ subunits are the only ones that hydrolyze ATP (30Lee S.H. Walker J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The δ′ subunit is homologous to γ and appears to play a role in modulating the access of δ to β (10Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29563-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 33Dong Z. Onrust R. Skangalis M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, the affinity between the γ complex and β is low compared with the affinity between the δ subunit and β (28Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Clamp assembly initiates when ATP binds the γ subunits and induces a change in conformation of the γ complex that results in ability of δ to bind β (28Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The δ′ subunit appears at least partially responsible for modulating the access of δ to β, since a previous study indicated that δ′ and β compete for interaction with δ (29Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The ATP-induced conformational change of γ complex may entail removing a surface of δ′ from δ, allowing δ to bind and open the β clamp. In the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, the clamp loader-β complex binds primer-template DNA with high affinity (32Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interaction of γ complex with DNA, especially primed template, triggers ATP hydrolysis and is stimulated by the presence of β (29Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,32Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21681-21686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis is coupled to closure of the clamp around DNA and γ complex turnover. The χ subunit of γ complex binds to SSB and helps coordinate the switch between the primase, clamp loader, and polymerase proteins at the primer template (38Kelman Z. Yuzhakov A. Andjelkovic J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2436-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 39Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1999; 96: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and ψ enhances the stability of the γ complex; however, these two proteins are not absolutely essential for clamp assembly (40O'Donnell M. Studwell P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Xiao H. Crombie R. Dong Z. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23476-23484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although all three subunits, γ, δ, and δ′, are required for loading β onto DNA, the single δ subunit appears to be the predominant contact between β and the γ complex (28Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It remains possible that weaker interactions between β and the other γ complex subunits exist. 3Weak interaction between γ and β and between χ and β can be detected by surface plasmon resonance (A. Yuzhakov and M. O'Donnell, unpublished observations). However, our previous studies demonstrated that δ alone can open and remove β clamps from circular DNA molecules with nearly the same efficiency as γ complex (k unloading γ− complex = 0.015 s−1; k δ unloading = 0.011 s−1) (24Leu F.P. Hingorani M.M. Turner J. O'Donnell M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34609-34618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We were therefore curious as to how the δ subunit generates the leverage required to part the apparently tightly closed β dimer interfaces. Previous studies indicate that β opening at just one interface is sufficient to allow passage of DNA into (or out of) the central cavity (29Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Experiments herein measure the exchange of labeled β subunits as they are utilized by the γ complex, and the results support the conclusion that the dimeric clamp is not split apart into monomers but rather stays intact during clamp assembly, presumably opening at only one interface for entry of DNA. In the simplest possible mechanism, the clamp loader could prompt clamp opening merely by perturbing one of the dimer interfaces and transiently reducing its stability. Study of the δ-β interaction in this report provides insight into how the δ and γ complex might open the β ring. We demonstrate here that the β ring retains its dimeric structure when bound by one δ subunit. Furthermore, we have mutated two hydrophobic residues in the β dimer interface to produce a stable monomeric version of β. Only one δ subunit binds the β monomer, which is surprising, given the one δ/two β stoichiometry of the wild type δ-β complex. This suggests that the binding site of δ on the β ring is located primarily on one of the two β subunits. The affinity of δ for the β monomer mutant is about 50-fold greater than for the β dimer, implying that the binding energy of δ to a single β subunit of the dimer is harnessed to perform work, namely to force open one of the dimer interfaces. The δ subunit binds β at the carboxyl terminus, which lies in the vicinity of the dimer interface (44Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that δ binding to one β protomer disrupts the contacts in a nearby dimer interface that hold the ring closed. Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. M13mp18 ssDNA was prepared by phenol extraction of purified M13mp18 phage that had been banded twice in CsCl gradients (45Turner J. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and primed with a 30-nucleotide primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (46Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Buffer A contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. DNA replication buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm ATP, 60 μm dGTP, and 60 μm dCTP. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) buffer contained 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. Proteins were purified as described: α, ε, γ (46Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M.

Mutant β proteins were constructed using DNA oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. Various N-terminal tagged versions of β (described below) were purified according to the previously described protocol for wild type β (7Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of tagged β with 32P was performed using [α-32P]ATP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase to a specific activity of ∼100 cpm/fmol as described (48Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase produced in E. coli was a gift from Dr. Susan Taylor (University of California, San Diego). 3H-β was labeled by reductive methylation as described (48Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The β, L273A-β, and I272A/L273A-β proteins (3 μm as dimer) were sized by gel filtration (at 4 °C) on an FPLC HR 10/30 Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A. The proteins were incubated in a final volume of 200 μl of Buffer A for 15 min at 15 °C and then applied to the column. After collecting 6-ml, 170-μl fractions were collected, and 25-μl aliquots of the indicated fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gels); proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For size standards, α (130 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and δ (39 kDa) were analyzed similarly. Interaction between δ and β was analyzed by incubating 9 μm δ with 12.5 μm wild type β (as dimer) or 25 μm I272A/L273A-β, (as monomer) for 15 min at 15 °C in a final volume of 200 μl of Buffer A, followed by gel filtration chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis as described above. Singly primed M13mp18 ssDNA (20 fmol), 0.8 μg of SSB, 75 fmol of Pol III*, and 750 fmol of β (wild type and mutant concentrations are calculated as monomer) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 min in 25 μl (final volume) of DNA replication buffer (this buffer contains ATP, dCTP, and dGTP). DNA synthesis was initiated upon the addition of the remaining two deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (60 μm dATP, 20 μm dTTP (final concentrations), and 1 μCi of [α-32P]dTTP). After 20 s, reactions were quenched with 25 μl of 40 mm EDTA and 1% SDS. Aliquots (20 μl) of the quenched reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% TBE-agarose gel, and the radiolabeled DNA was visualized on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Synthesis was quantitated by spotting 20-μl aliquots of the reaction on DE81 filters, followed by liquid scintillation counting as described (49Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 758-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The δ subunit (10 μl of 0.6 μm) was immobilized on a carboxymethylated dextran matrix-coated sensor chip (CM5; Biacore) by carbodiimide coupling in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5). SPR analysis was performed at 23 °C by injecting 15 μl of β or I272A/L273A−β (0.25 and 1.23 μm; concentrations for both are given as monomer) in SPR buffer, at a flow rate of 5 μl/s. After each analysis was complete, the chip surface was regenerated by injecting 10 μl of 0.1 m glycine (pH 9.5) over the chip, which releases bound β with no significant effect on the binding capacity of the immobilized δ protein. The kinetic constants for interaction between δ and β were determined by nonlinear curve fitting, using the BIAevaluation 2.1 software. The rate of dissociation (k off) was calculated by fitting the curves to a single exponential decay described by Equation 1,R=R0e−koff(t−t0)Equation 1 where R 0 represents the response andt 0 represents the time at the start of the dissociation phase. The association rate (k on) was calculated using the binding model A + B= AB and Equation 2,R=Req(1−e−konC+koff)(t−t0)Equation 2 where R eq is the response at steady state, C is the concentration of β, andt 0 is the time at the start of the association phase. The dissociation constant (K d) for interaction between β and δ was calculated ask off/k on. The two β mutants for this assay were constructed by placing the β gene into either the pHKEp vector or the pHKEpmut vector (50Kelman Z. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both of these vectors place a 34-amino acid tag onto the N terminus of the protein. The tags contain a protein kinase site (to label the protein with 32P) and either a functional (pHKEp) or a nonfunctional (pHKEpmut) hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. The nonfunctional epitope was formed by replacing two amino acids; YPYDVPDYA was changed to YPYDVPAAA. After expression and purification, one β contains a functional HA epitope (haβ2) and the other β contains a nonfunctional HA epitope, which we use in this report in the phosphorylated form and refer to as32P-β2. The β with the mutated HA-epitope was labeled with 32P (32P-β) as described (48Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Titrations of these β variants showed that they were as active as wild type β in replication assays with Pol III* on SSB-coated M13mp18 ssDNA primed with a single oligonucleotide. Monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope was purchased from BabCo, and Protein A-Sepharose 4B was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. The HA antibody was conjugated to Protein A beads by incubation for 15 min at 25 °C in 400 μl of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol. Spontaneous protomer exchange was measured (i.e. no other proteins besides β) in 50-μl reactions containing 2 pmol of32P-β2 and 2 pmol ofhaβ2 in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 h before the addition of 50 μl of HA antibody-conjugated beads and placed at 4 °C for a further 30 min. Beads were pelleted, washed three times with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% Triton X-100; resuspended in Eco-Lume (ICN); and counted in a scintillation counter. Control experiments were performed similarly except that either no antibody was conjugated to the beads or the haβ2 was not added to the reaction. To measure the effect of γ complex on β protomer exchange during clamp assembly onto DNA, 250 fmol each ofhaβ2 and 32P-β2were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with 500 fmol of γ complex and 1.8 pmol of nicked pBS DNA in 70 μl of 20 nm Tris-HCl (pH. 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, and 8 mmMgCl2. The reaction was then applied to a 5-ml A15m gel filtration column equilibrated with the same buffer plus 0.15 m NaCl. Fractions of six drops each were collected, and those containing β on DNA were identified by scintillation counting and pooled (420 μl), and then the DNA was linearized upon treatment with 700 units of BamHI for 3 min at 37 °C to release β. To confirm that linearization was complete within this time, an aliquot (20 μl) was removed, quenched with 20 μl of 1% SDS, 40 mm EDTA, and then analyzed in a native agarose gel. Then 50 μl of HA antibody beads were added to the reaction, and incubation was continued for a further 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted; washed three times with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% Triton X-100; resuspended in Eco-Lume (ICN); and counted in a scintillation counter. In a control experiment, the above procedure was repeated except that heterodimeric β was used in the assembly reaction by first preincubating 250 fmol of each β in one tube for 5 h at 37 °C before adding to the reaction containing γ complex and DNA. Reactions contained 67.5 pmol of3H-β2 (wild type β labeled by reductive methylation), 1.7 nmol of hisβ2, which contained a six-residue histidine tag on a 23-residue N-terminal leader (β was cloned into the pHK vector in Ref. 50Kelman Z. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and 6.6 nmol of δ (where present) in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 8 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. A control reaction utilized 1.7 nmol of unlabeled wild type β2 in placed of thehisβ2 derivative. Reactions were assembled on ice and then shifted to 37 °C, and aliquots of 20 μl were removed at 2 and 24 h of incubation. Upon removal of an aliquot, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and the reaction was applied to a 1-ml nickel chelate column (HiTrap; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm imidazole, 8 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. The column was washed with 5 ml of the same buffer and then eluted with 3 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1m imidazole, 8 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. The flow-through (wash) and bound (elution) fractions were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting and analyzed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to confirm the presence of δ with β in the bound fractions. The typical yield of3H-β2 off the column was greater than 85%. We have shown previously that the β clamp is a tight dimer and remains a dimer even when diluted to a concentration of 50 nm (23Yao N.

https://openalex.org/W2085680371,"NCAM polysialylation plays a critical role in neuronal development and regeneration. Polysialylation of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is catalyzed by two polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia II (STX) and ST8Sia IV (PST), which contain sialylmotifs L and S conserved in all members of the sialyltransferases. The members of the ST8Sia gene family, including ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV are unique in having three cysteines in sialylmotif L, one cysteine in sialylmotif S, and one cysteine at the COOH terminus. However, structural information, including how disulfide bonds are formed, has not been determined for any of the sialyltransferases. To obtain insight into the structure/function of ST8Sia IV, we expressed human ST8Sia IV in insect cells,Trichoplusia ni, and found that the enzyme produced in the insect cells catalyzes NCAM polysialylation, although it cannot polysialylate itself (“autopolysialylation”). We also found that ST8Sia IV does not form a dimer through disulfide bonds. By using the same enzyme preparation and performing mass spectrometric analysis, we found that the first cysteine in sialylmotif L and the cysteine in sialylmotif S form a disulfide bridge, whereas the second cysteine in sialylmotif L and the cysteine at the COOH terminus form a second disulfide bridge. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that mutation at cysteine residues involved in the disulfide bridges completely inactivated the enzyme. Moreover, changes in the position of the COOH-terminal cysteine abolished its activity. By contrast, the addition of green fluorescence protein at the COOH terminus of ST8Sia IV did not render the enzyme inactive. These results combined indicate that the sterical structure formed by intramolecular disulfide bonds, which bring the sialylmotifs and the COOH terminus within close proximity, is critical for the catalytic activity of ST8Sia IV.

Among these carbohydrates, polysialic acid is a linear homopolymer of α2,8-linked sialic acid, primarily attached to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)1(3Finne J. J. Biol.

However, polysialylated NCAM is continuously present in hippocampus and the olfactory bulb, where neuronal regeneration persists in the adult (6Seki T. Arai Y. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 17: 265-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Studies using endoneuraminidase showed that cell migration and synaptic plasticity are dependent on the presence of polysialic acid (7Hu H. Tomasiewicz H. Magnuson T. Rutishauser U. Neuron. 1996; 16: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 8Muller D. Wang C. Skibo G. Toni N. Cremer H. Calaora V. Rougon G. Kiss J.Z.

In contrast with vertebrate NCAM, NCAM homologues in Aplysiaand Drosophila, apCAM and FasII, respectively, are not polysialylated. In these species, their activity in neuronal regeneration and axon guidance is modulated by removal of the protein from the cell surface by endocytosis (9Mayford M. Barzilai A. Keller F. Schacher S. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 256: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) or expression of an anti-adhesive protein (10Fambrough D. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These results indicate that polysialic acid evolved in vertebrates and plays critical roles in formation and remodeling of the nervous system as a common and unique regulator of the adhesive property of NCAM in vertebrates. Polysialic acid is also detected in neuroblastoma (11Hildebrandt H. Becker C. Glüer S. Rösner H. Gerardy-Schahn R. Rahmann H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 779-784PubMed Google Scholar), Wilms' tumor (12Roth J. Zubber C. Wagner P. Taatjes D.J. Weisgerber C. Heitz P.U. Goridis C. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3072-3080PubMed Google Scholar). In both small cell and non-small cell lung carcinomas, the expression of polysialic acid is associated with tumor progression, in particular with tumor metastasis (13Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tanaka F. Otake Y. Nakagawa T. Kawano Y. Miyahara R. Li M. Yanagihara K. Nakayama J. Fujimoto I. Ikenaka K. Wada H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3072-3080PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, capsules of certain pathogenic bacteria that cause meningitis bear polysialic acid (15Robbins J.B. McCracken G.H.J. Gotschlich E.C. Ørskov F. Ørskov I. Hanson L.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1974; 290: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These combined results suggest that polysialic acid facilitates cell migration and allows pathogens to avoid attack by the immune system in vivo. To develop therapeutic agents for the treatment of these diseases and determine the roles of polysialic acid in neural development, it is important to understand the mechanisms of polysialic acid synthesis. To date, two polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia IV (PST) and ST8Sia II (STX), have been cloned and shown to synthesize polysialic acid on NCAM (16Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol.

These enzymes catalyze transfer of multiple α2,8-linked sialic acid residues to an acceptor containing a NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R structure without participation of other enzymes (21Nakayama J.

Becker C. Murau M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Rahmann H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Ong E. Nakayama J. Angata K. Reyes L. Katsuyama T. Arai Y. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of these mammalian polysialyltransferases are not related to bacterial polysialic acid synthase (27Troy F.A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that inactivation of ST8Sia IV in mice through homologous recombination leads to impaired long term potentiation and long term depression in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of the adult hippocampus (28Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Crèmer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of polysialic acid in the above mutant mice was incomplete, because ST8Sia II compensates for the loss of ST8Sia IV. These results suggest that ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II are the key enzymes that control the expression of polysialic acid in vivo. Polysialyltransferases belong to the vertebrate sialyltransferase gene family that includes α2,3-, α2,6-, and α2,8-sialyltransferases. Sialyltransferases have a type II membrane protein topology as do almost all Golgi-associated glycosyltransferases cloned so far. As generally seen for these enzymes, a short cytoplasmic segment of ST8Sia II and IV is connected to a transmembrane domain followed by a large intraluminal domain consisting of a stem region and catalytic domain. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of various sialyltransferases shows two weak but discernible homologous regions in their catalytic domains, called sialylmotifs L and S (29Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 2-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated by analysis of ST6Gal I that sialylmotif L is involved in the binding to the donor substrate, CMP-NeuNAc, whereas sialylmotif S participates in the binding to both donor and acceptor substrates (30Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 31Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The members of α2,8-sialyltransferases (ST8Sia) are characteristic in having one conserved cysteine at the COOH-terminal end, three cysteine residues in the sialylmotif L, and one in the sialylmotif S (Fig.1). On the other hand, all of the other sialyltransferases contain only one conserved cysteine residue in each sialylmotifs L and S. Except for ST6Gal I (32Weinstein J. Lee E.U. McEntee K. Lai P.H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17735-17743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), none of the other sialyltransferases contains a cysteine at the COOH terminus. Disulfide bond structures have not been determined for any members of sialyltransferases, and it is not known how sialylmotifs L and S work together. In the present study, we first expressed ST8Sia IV in insect cells using a Baculovirus system. We found that ST8Sia IV produced in insect cells or mammalian cells exists as a monomer and adds polysialic acid to NCAM, although the enzyme preparation from the insect cells cannot polysialylate itself (“autopolysialylation” (33Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Close B.E. Tao K. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4484-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). We then determined by mass spectrometric analysis that disulfide bonds are intramolecularly formed between the COOH terminus and sialylmotif L and between sialylmotifs L and S. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated the absolute requirement of these disulfide bridges and the position of the cysteine at the COOH terminus. These results indicate that sialylmotifs L and S and the COOH-terminal region are close to each other, and such a unique sterical structure is important for the polysialylation activity of ST8Sia IV. Isolation of pcDNAI harboring ST8Sia IV cDNA, pcDNAI-ST8Sia IV, and a soluble form of ST8Sia IV fused to a signal peptide and the IgG binding domain of protein A, pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia IV, was described previously (18Nakayama J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). pcDNAI-ST8Sia II and pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia II were cloned as described previously (35Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7182-7190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). pIG-NCAM·IgG(VASE,MSD) encoding a soluble NCAM-140 fused with a hinge and constant regions of IgG was kindly provided by Dr. David Simmons at Oxford University (36Simmons D.L. Hartly D. Cellular Interactions in Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 93-127Google Scholar). The vector, originally designated as pIG-NCAM, was found to contain both VASE and MSD sequences. Because such an NCAM(VASE,MSD) is unusual, a 2198-bp DNA sequence containing both VASE and MSD sequences was excised withHindIII and KpnI from pIG-NCAM(VASE,MSD) and was replaced with the corresponding HindIII/KpnI fragment (2050 bp) of NCAM-140 (17Eckhardt M. Muhlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), resulting in pIG-NCAM. The obtained cDNA sequence was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. To construct cDNA encoding ST8Sia IV fused with FLAGF epitope or GFP protein, cDNA fragment encoding ST8Sia IV was amplified by PCR using T7 primer and 3′-primer (5′-CTGGTACCTGCTTTACACACTTTCC-3′; the KpnI site is underlined, and the rest of the sequence encodes nucleotides 1076–1060 of ST8Sia IV). The PCR product was digested withHindIII and KpnI and subcloned into the same sites of pFLAG-CMV-5b (Sigma) or pcDNA3.1-EGFP, resulting in pFLAG-ST8Sia IV or pcDNA3.1-ST8Sia IV·EGFP. Similarly, ST8Sia II cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using T7 primer and 3′-primer (5′-TGGTACCGTGGCCCCATCGCACTGGCC-3′; the KpnI site is underlined, and the rest of the sequence encodes 1124–1105), and pFLAG-ST8Sia II and pcDNA3.1-ST8Sia II·EGFP were obtained. pcDNA3.1-EGFP was constructed from pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) by excising cDNA fragment withEcoRI/NotI digestion and cloned into the same sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The cDNAs for the full-length enzymes fused with the FLAG epitope were expressed in HeLa cells, and all the lysates were dissolved in the sample buffer with or without 2-mercaptoethanol. FLAG-tagged enzymes were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.) and the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A vector for soluble form-containing 6×His peptide was first constructed as follows. AKpnI-HindIII fragment encoding a signal peptide from pcDNAI·A vector (21Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and aHindIII-BamHI fragment of pcDNA3.1-HisB (Invitrogen) encoding for 6×His peptide were subcloned into pcDNA3.1-Hygro after digestion with KpnI andBamHI, resulting in pcDNA3.1-HSH (Hygro-Signal-6×His). A BamHI-XbaI fragment of pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia IV (nucleotides 118–1080) was subcloned into the same sites of pcDNA3.1-HSH, resulting in pcDNA3.1-His·ST8Sia IV, which harbors the coding region of a signal peptide, His tag, and catalytic domain of ST8Sia IV. Similarly, a PCR-amplifiedBglII-XhoI fragment of ST8Sia II (nucleotides 95–1125) (24Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was placed into pcDNA3.1-HSH digested withBamHI and XhoI. His·ST8Sia IV and His·ST8Sia II released from transfected mammalian and insect cells were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) and an ECL Plus kit. ABamHI-XbaI fragment of pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia IV (21Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the same sites of pcDNA3.1-HisB. Using this construct as a template, cDNA encoding 6×His peptide and the same portion of ST8Sia IV as A·ST8Sia IV was amplified by PCR and subcloned into BamHI and XbaI sites of the pAcGP67A vector (PharMingen), which contains a gp67 secretion signal peptide driven by the Baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, resulting in pAcGP67A-His·ST8Sia IV. This transfer vector was used to obtain recombinant Baculovirus. High-Five insect cells, Trichoplusia ni (Invitrogen), were infected with the recombinant Baculovirus, and culture medium was collected 3 days after infection. His-tagged ST8Sia IV fusion protein, His·ST8Sia IV (BV), secreted from the insect cells was purified using ProBond Ni-beads (Invitrogen). His·ST8Sia IV (BV) eluted from Ni-beads was used as an enzyme source. For protein chemical analysis, the enzyme was concentrated by Microcon 30 (Millipore) and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, three times. The recovered protein at a concentration of 0.5 μg/μl was used for disulfide mapping analysis as follows. A sample of the concentrated ST8Sia IV (∼15 μg in 30 μl) was treated with a 20 times molar excess of PEO-maleimide-activated biotin and immediately denatured with 8 m urea. The sample was incubated for 60 min in the dark at room temperature (total volume, 45 μl). The concentration of urea in the sample was reduced to 2 m by addition of water. Trypsin or chymotrypsin (1/10, w/w ratio of the protease/protein) was then added, and the mixture (180 μl) was incubated overnight at 37 °C. A portion of the proteolytic digest was treated withN-glycanase overnight at 37 °C. N-glycanase was dissolved at a concentration of 200 units/ml in 100 mmsodium phosphate containing 25 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, and added to the proteolytic digest to a final concentration of 20 units/ml. The digests were fractionated using a capillary C18 column (150 × 0.18 mm; Nucleosil, 5-μm particle size) and analyzed on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer with a modified electrospray ionization (ESI) source (37Holmes E.H. Yen T.-Y. Thomas S. Joshi R. Nguyen A. Long T. Gallet F. Maftah A. Julien R. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The LC/MS analysis was conducted using a Hewlett-Packard 1050 high pressure liquid chromatography system coupled to the LCQ. The mobile phase was split before the injector by a Tee-connector, and a flow rate of 2 μl/min was established through the capillary C18 column. The sample was eluted by three-step linear gradient from 95% of the solution A (0.5% formic acid in water) and 5% of the solution B (0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile) in the first 10 min, 10–35% of the solution B in the next 40 min, and 35–40% of the solution B in the last 5 min. The LC/ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed using an automated data acquisition procedure, in which a cyclic series of three different scan modes was performed (35Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7182-7190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 36Simmons D.L. Hartly D. Cellular Interactions in Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 93-127Google Scholar). Data acquisition was conducted using the full scan mode (m/z 300–2000) to obtain the most intense peak (signal > 1.5 × 105 counts) as the precursor ion, followed by a high resolution zoom scan mode to determine the charge state of the precursor ion and an MS/MS scan mode (with a relative collision energy of 38%) to determine the structural fragment ions of the precursor ion. The resulting MS/MS spectra were then searched against a protein data base (Owl) by Sequest to confirm the sequence of tryptic or chymotryptic peptides. The details of the LC/ESI-MS/MS procedure were described elsewhere (38Yen T.-Y. Joshi R.K. Yan H. Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Macher B.A. J. Mass. Spectrom. 2000; 35: 990-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Five Cys residues in ST8Sia IV were mutated to Ala by the PCR. C142A was introduced by ligating two PCR-amplified fragments. 5′- and 3′-primers for the first PCR are T7 primer and 5′-CGGCCGGCGGTCTTAAACCTGCGATTCTTC-3′. For the second PCR, 5′-CTTTGCGCAGTTGTTGGAAATTCTGGCAT-3′ (5′-primer) and a downstream primer containing the stop codon and XbaI site were used for the second PCR. After digestion with NaeI andFspI, these two PCR products are ligated atGCCGCA sequence containing Ala142instead of Cys142 (the codon for Ala142 issingly underlined). Other mutations were made as follows: C156A (GAGGCA, generated by digestion withEcl136II (GAGCTC) and FspI (TGCGCA)), C169A (AGGGCA, generated by digestion with StuI (AGGCCT) andFspI (TGCGCA)), C292A (TTTGCA, generated by digestion withDraI (TTTAAA) and FspI (TGCGCA)); single underlines denote Ala codons. C356A mutant was made as described below. From the ST8Sia IV COOH terminus, two to four amino acids were removed by PCR using the 5′-primer 5′-GGGTCTCCCTCAGTTGTACAAAGAGCATTT-3′ (theunderlined sequence corresponds to nucleotides 577–597) and the 3′-primer containing a deletion followed by a stop codon and anXbaI site. The amplified fragment digested withPmlI and XbaI replaced wild-type sequences of pcDNAI-ST8Sia IV. Similarly, mutant forms of ST8Sia IV, in which Cys356 has been altered to Ala356, Cys354, Cys355, Cys357 or Cys358, or in which Thr353, Gly354, or Lys355 is mutated, were generated by the same PCR method using mutated 3′-primers. cDNAs encoding membrane or soluble forms of wild-type and mutant enzymes were transfected into COS-1 cells or HeLa cells stably expressing NCAM using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) as described previously (23Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained with 12F8 (PharMingen), a rat monoclonal antibody specific to polysialic acid (39Chung W.W. Lagenaur C.F. Yan Y.M. Lund J.S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 314: 290-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Rhodamine-conjugated goat immunoglobulins specific to rat IgM (Cappel). The same set of antibodies was used to analyze transfected cells by FACSort (Becton Dickinson), as described previously (23Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant forms of soluble enzymes. Forty-eight h after transfection, the culture medium was changed to serum-free medium (Life Technologies), and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. Soluble enzymes were collected from the spent media using human IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The quantity of each enzyme bound to the beads was measured by Western blot analysis using peroxidase-conjugated rabbit immunoglobulins (Cappel) and an ECL Plus kit as described previously (23Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). An equivalent amount of each mutant enzyme adsorbed to beads was used for in vitro sialyltransferase assays in 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton CF-54, 2.4 nmol (0.7 μCi) of CMP-[14C]NeuNAc, and 10 pmol of NCAM·IgG. After incubation, NCAM·IgG in the supernatant was obtained by brief centrifugation and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography as described previously (21Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For the assay of autopolysialylation, the incubation mixture omitted NCAM·IgG, and the radiolabeled enzymes were released from beads and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography (24Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, His·ST8Sia IV (BV) secreted from insect cells was used as an enzyme source under the same assay conditions. To determine the structure and function of ST8SiaIV, ST8Sia IV was produced in insect cells as a soluble protein fused with 6×His peptide. Fig.2 A shows that ST8Sia IV produced in the insect cells, His·ST8Sia IV (BV), migrated at the same position regardless of the presence or absence of reducing agent. Its molecular mass (∼46 kDa) corresponds to that expected from the amino acid sequence (41 kDa) plus glycosylation, indicating no dimer was formed. To confirm that this is true also for an intact form of ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II, the entire sequence of ST8SiaIV or ST8Sia II fused with FLAG tag peptide at the COOH terminus was expressed in HeLa cells. It was shown that ST8Sia IV or ST8Sia II fused with the FLAG tag can form polysialic acid in transfected HeLa cells (data not shown). Although a small amount of dimer was also formed in the absence of a reducing agent, ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia II mainly existed as a monomer (Fig. 2 B). The negligible amount of dimers was probably due to nonspecific aggregation, because this amount was increased when the samples were frozen and heated in the sample buffer under milder conditions (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 A, ST8Sia IV produced in the insect cells added as much polysialic acid to NCAM as did ST8Sia IV produced in HeLa cells. ST8Sia IV produced in the insect cells, however, failed to add polysialic acid to itself (autopolysialylation) (Fig. 3 B), most likely because ST8Sia IV produced in insect cells contained only immatureN-glycans. Indeed, endoneuraminidase treatment did not change the molecular mass of ST8Sia IV produced in the insect cells (data not shown). Moreover, the size of this ST8Sia IV produced in insect cells was smaller than that of the same enzyme produced in HeLa cells (Fig. 2 A), indicating the difference inN-glycosylation between two cell systems. These results combined demonstrate that ST8Sia IV can extensively form polysialic acid on NCAM when autopolysialylation is not detectable (see also “Discussion”). Previously it has been shown that Asn74 is theN-glycosylation site where the majority of autopolysialylation occurs (34Close B.E. Tao K. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4484-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The absence of autopolysialylation could thus occur if Asn74 is not utilized in the insect cells. To determine whether or not N-glycan was attached to Asn74, the ST8SiaIV sample used in the above experiments was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis after tryptic digestion. By liquid chromatography/electron spray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) analysis, more than 86% of the amino acid sequence predicted from the ST8Sia IV cDNA was confirmed using the protein data base searching program Sequest. Four of the five peptides that contain N-glycosylation consensus sequences were not detected, but a peptide containing Asn219 was detected. After treatment with N-glycanase, however, the other peptides containing a consensus N-glycosylation sequence (peptides c"

Our previous studies have shown that certain MREs of the human MT-IIA gene (MREb, MREc, MREd, and MREf) are less active than the others (MREa, MREe, and MREg). Gel shift analysis of HeLa cell nuclear proteins revealed that whereas the active MREs strongly bind the transcription factor MTF-1 essential for metal regulation, the less active MREs bind another distinct protein, MREb-BF. This protein recognizes the GC-rich region of MREb rather than the MRE core required for MTF-1 binding. All the MREs recognized by MREb-BF contain the CGCCC and/or CACCC motif, suggesting that the MREb-BF·MRE complex contains Sp1 or related proteins. Supershift analysis using antibodies against Sp1 family proteins as well as gel shift analysis using the recombinant Sp1 demonstrated that Sp1 represents the majority of MREb-BF activity. An MREb mutant with reduced affinity to Sp1 mediated zinc-inducible transcription much more actively than the wild-type MREb. Furthermore, when placed in the native promoter, this mutant MREb raised the overall promoter activity. These results strongly suggest that Sp1 acts as a negative regulator of transcription mediated by specific MREs.

A number of MRE-binding proteins have been reported (reviewed in Ref.6Koizumi S. Otsuka F. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III.

After that, a search for MRE-related sequences revealed that there are multiple MRE homologs in the upstream region of all the mammalian MT genes reported so far (3Stuart G.W. Searle P.F.

These facts imply that such a redundancy is probably essential for the high metal inducibility of MT gene promoters. However, MREs are not always functionally equivalent. In transfection assays using reporter genes driven by synthetic MRE-containing promoters, striking differences in zinc-induced transcriptional activity were observed among MREs of the mMT-I (3Stuart G.W.

In addition, we have observed that the transcriptional activity of MRE does not always reflect its binding affinity to MTF-1; certain MREs of the hMT-IIA gene are able to bind the purified human MTF-1 in vitro, although they show no or very low transcriptional activity in vivo (11Koizumi S.

We had assumed that additional transcriptional regulators might be responsible for such a discrepancy and explored HeLa cell crude nuclear extracts for another MRE binding activity. Here we show that a nuclear protein distinct from MTF-1, which was finally proven to be the transcription factor Sp1 (SV40 protein 1), binds to the less active MREs and probably acts as a negative regulator of MRE-mediated transcription.

The 288-residue follistatin molecule is comprised of a 63-residue N-terminal segment followed by three repeating 10-cysteine “follistatin domains” also represented in several extracellular matrix proteins. We have used chemical modifications and mutational analyses to define structural requirements for follistatin bioactivity that previously have not been investigated systematically. Mutant follistatins were stably expressed from Chinese hamster ovary cell cultures and assayed for activin binding in a solid-phase competition assay. Biological activities were determined by inhibition of activin-mediated transcriptional activity and by suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone secretion by cultured anterior pituitary cells. Deletion of the entire N-terminal domain, disruption of N-terminal disulfides, and deletion of the first two residues each reduced activin binding to <5 % of expressed wild-type follistatin and abolished the ability of the respective mutants to suppress activin-mediated responses in both bioassay systems. Hence, the three follistatin domains inherently lack the ability to bind or neutralize activin. Activin binding was impaired after oxidation of at least one tryptophan, at position 4, in FS-288. Mutation of Trp to Ala or Asp at either positions 4 or 36 eliminated activin binding and bioactivity. Mutation of a third hydrophobic residue, Phe-52, reduced binding to 20%, whereas substitutions for the individual Lys and Arg residues in the N-terminal region were tolerated.

No “receptor” for follistatin has been found, but its mode of action in the pituitary became clear with the demonstration (6Nakamura T. Takio K. Eto Y. Shibai H. Titani K. Sugino H. Science. 1990; 247: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) that the protein binds the activin A homodimer with high affinity, approaching irreversibility because of its slow dissociation rate (7Schneyer A.L. Rzucidlo D.A. Sluss P.M. Crowley W.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence have now shown that, rather than “presenting” activin to its receptor as in the case of certain circulating binding proteins, follistatin sequesters activin to prevent stimulation of FSH secretion (8Meriggiola M. Dahl K.D. Mather J.P. Bremner W.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1967-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9deWinter J.P. ten Dijke P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E.

More recently, follistatin has been reported to accelerate endocytosis and degradation of activin (10Hashimoto O. Nakamura T. Shoji H. Shimasaki S. Hayashi Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13835-13842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Insights into follistatin's importance have paralleled the steadily unfolding evidence for multiple roles played by activin and its relatives in the transforming growth factor-β family of regulatory factors (2Michel U.

Hence, earlier emphasis on follistatin as a circulating factor has been largely superseded by evidence for its role as a local cellular regulator with structural similarities to a number of extracellular matrix proteins involved in cellular regulation and development. Although most abundant in pituitary, ovary, testis, and kidney, follistatin is widely distributed among all tissues in which activin is also present (2Michel U. Farnworth P. Findlay J.K. Mol. Cell.

In fact, the lethal effects found in follistatin-null animals are attributable to skeletal and cutaneous abnormalities (12Matzuk M.M. Llu N. Vogel H. Sellheyer K. Roop D.R. Jaenisch R. Bradley A.

The domain structure of follistatin is characteristic of a large number of proteins derived originally through a process of exon shuffling. Following a signal peptide and a 63-residue N-terminal segment, the remainder of the molecule (residues 64–288) consists of three successive 73–77 residue domains, precisely defined by exon-intron junctions, which are clearly related by alignment of their ten cysteine residues (Fig. 1). These repeats were likened initially to the epidermal growth factor-like sequences found in many proteins, as well as to the Kazal or ovomucoid family of protease inhibitors. However, the cysteines in these sequences align only partially, and in the case of the ovomucoids, intron phasing of these repeats do not match those found in follistatin (13Patthy L. Nikolics K. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 76-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). With the appearance of similar ten-cysteine sequences in osteonectin (SPARC/BM40), agrin and an increasing number of other extracellular matrix proteins, it has become clear that this repeating motif represents a distinct “follistatin-like” domain (13Patthy L. Nikolics K. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 76-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Each follistatin domain forms an autonomous folding unit, as confirmed by the crystal structure of the single follistatin domain from SPARC/BM40 (14Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) localizing all disulfide linkages exclusively to intradomain cysteines. Follistatin domains have been proposed or shown to interact with growth factors and other ligands in several extracellular or transmembrane proteins (13Patthy L. Nikolics K.

Yamakawa N. Hasegawa Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40788-40796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the structural requirements for activin binding by follistatin itself have not been investigated systematically. The (1–63) N-terminal domain differs markedly from the follistatin domains in its length, amino acid sequence, and the alignment of its six cysteine residues. Its functional importance has been suggested by our own results (18Wang Q.F. Keutmann H.T. Schneyer A.L. Sluss P.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3183-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showing direct binding of activin by two synthetic peptides representing discontinuous sequences from this region, together with an earlier mutagenesis experiment (19Inouye S. Guo Y. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in which insertion of two residues at the N terminus abolished activin binding. The chemical modifications and mutational analyses of FS-288 described in this report establish the essential role of an intact N-terminal domain in activin binding and in the transcriptional and biological effects of follistatin-activin interaction. A striking requirement for hydrophobic residues within this domain suggests a mechanism for activin neutralization through competition with essential hydrophobic residues (20Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S. Donaldson C.J. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3206-3212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in the type II activin receptor binding site. Pure recombinant human follistatin-288 was obtained courtesy of the National Hormone and Pituitary Project, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Partially purified follistatin for coating of plates in the binding assays was prepared by affinity chromatography of expressed FS-288 on a solid support containing polyclonal anti-FS antibody 7FS30 (21Wang Q.F. Khoury R.H. Smith P.C. McConnell D.S. Padmanahban V. Midgley A.R. Schneyer A.L. Crowley W.F. Sluss P.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recombinant human activin A for iodination was purchased from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. Activin A for treating cells was prepared by transfection of human embryonic kidney-293 cells with an expression vector containing the human inhibin βA-subunit cDNA as described by Delbaere et al. (22Delbaere A. Sidis Y. Schneyer A.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2463-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The follistatin-288 coding sequence was removed from pHTF302R (a gift of Dr. S. Shimasaki, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego) and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/myc-His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA). The resulting construct (pFS288mycHis) was then used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's recommendation. To make the N-terminal deletion construct (ΔNTD), the follistatin signal peptide sequence (exon 1) was fused to the first FS domain (exon 3) by two polymerase chain reaction amplification steps. In the first step, two partially overlapping FS fragments were generated using the fused sequence oligonucleotide CCCCAACTGCATCCCCTGTAAAAAGACTTGTCGGGATGTTTTCTGTCC as a forward primer with a pcDNA3.1/bGH reverse primer in one reaction and a T7 primer with the complementary oligonucleotide as a reverse primer in a separate concurrent reaction. The two overlapping products were fused and amplified using the T7 and pcDNA3.1/bGH reverse primers in the second polymerase chain reaction step. Following restriction digestion, the final mutated polymerase chain reaction product was purified and cloned back into pcDNA3.1/myc-His. Mutant sequences were verified by bidirectional sequencing at the DNA sequencing core facility of Massachusetts General Hospital. The pFS288mycHis vectors bearing mutant or wild-type follistatins were transfected into CHO cells using polybrene (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ) and stably secreting cells were selected using geneticin. Secretion was monitored by immunoassay (below), and screened for activin binding by solid-phase assay of conditioned medium. Follistatins were isolated from medium by binding to nickel-Sepharose affinity columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) via the C-terminal poly(His) tag. Following stepwise elution with imidazole, products (typically eluting between 50 and 150 mm imidazole at pH 6.8) were concentrated and exchanged into activin binding assay buffer by filter centrifugation (Centriprep-10 tubes; Amicon, Bedford, MA). Conditioned medium from nontransfected CHO cells was processed similarly for use as a control preparation in all assays. Follistatin concentrations in medium and affinity eluates were established by two independent immunological assays: (a) a two-site solid-phase immunochemiluminescent assay (SPICA) using a monoclonal detection antibody (7FS-30) specific to an epitope (residues 168–178; Fig.1 A) within FS domain II, as previously described (21Wang Q.F. Khoury R.H. Smith P.C. McConnell D.S. Padmanahban V. Midgley A.R. Schneyer A.L. Crowley W.F. Sluss P.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and (b) a solution-phase assay directed toward the C-terminal Myc tag. The synthetic peptide (YGGGGEQKLISEEDLN), incorporating the Myc epitope linked by a poly(Gly) spacer to an N-terminal tyrosine for 125I labeling, was used as radioligand and reference standard. Sample (0.3–100 nm) and radioligand were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin buffer under equilibrium conditions for 20 h at 20 °C with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at a final concentration of 1:2400 in a total assay volume of 500 μl. Tracer-bound antibody was precipitated for counting by addition of 100 μl of a 1:12 dilution of ovine anti-rabbit γ-globulin prepared in the Reproductive Endocrine Unit at MGH. Content of Myc-tagged follistatin was computed from the Myc-peptide standard curve and compared with the concentrations based on the SPICA assay (above). Binding of expressed follistatins to labeled activin was determined by competition assay as previously described (7Schneyer A.L. Rzucidlo D.A. Sluss P.M. Crowley W.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mutant or wild-type follistatins were incubated with125I-labeled activin in binding buffer (10 mmphosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% gelatin, 0.05% Tween; 200 μl) for 2 h at 20 °C and then added to 96-well plates (Immulon-2; Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) coated with 25 ng of affinity-purified FS288. After incubation at 20o for 90 min, wells were washed and counted in a gamma counter. Each mutant preparation was assayed in at least three independent experiments. Relative potencies were calculated by comparison of half-maximal inhibiton of labeled activin binding to the solid-phase follistatin by mutant and wild-type follistatins, respectively. Methionine residues were cleaved by incubating a 50 μg-aliquot of pure FS-288 with 130 mm cyanogen bromide in 70% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (18 h, 20 °C) followed by lyophilization for binding assay. Cleavage was confirmed by Edman amino acid sequence analysis of modified FS aliquots using the Applied Biosystems 477A gas/liquid-phase microsequencer. Mild oxidation of methionine and tryptophan was performed by incubation of pure FS-288 in a 1:50 dilution of 30% H2O2 for 45 min at 37 °C followed by lyophilization and reconstitution in binding assay buffer. HEK-293 cells, maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, were plated in 24-well trays at 105 cells per well. When 60–70% confluent, cells were cotransfected (Effectene; Qiagen) with 100 ng of ARE-GFP-Lux (22Delbaere A. Sidis Y. Schneyer A.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2463-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 80 ng of pFAST-1 expression vector (a gift of Dr. Malcolm Whitman, Harvard Medical School), and 20 ng of pRL-TK (Promega, Madison WI) for normalizing responses based onRenilla activity. The construction of the ARE-GFP-Lux and specificity of the ARE-FAST-1 reporter system for activin has been previously described (22Delbaere A. Sidis Y. Schneyer A.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2463-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 16 h post-transfection, cells were treated with fresh medium containing 5 ng/ml (0.15 nm) activin, alone or preincubated (60 min) with 50 ng/ml (1.5 nm) of various FS preparations for an additional 24 h in triplicate. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system from Promega. Experiments were performed at least twice, and the mean ± S.E. of triplicate wells from a representative experiment is reported. Assay for suppression by follistatin of basal FSH secretion in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells was based on the method of Scott et al.(24Scott R.S. Burger H.G. Quigg H. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The anterior pituitary glands of adult male Sprague Dawley rats (Pel Freez Biologicals, Rogers AK) were mechanically and enzymatically dispersed with 0.4% trypsin and 0.25% DNase and plated at 2.5 × 105 cells/0.5 ml well in 48-well trays in α-minimum essential medium (αMEM) containing 21 mmNaHCO3, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 10% penicillin/streptomycin solution, pH 7.4. Following incubation at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 for 72 h, the monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and reincubated in 0.5 ml of fresh medium containing the various follistatin and control preparations at the specified concentrations. After 72 h, the conditioned medium was assayed for rat FSH using reagents and protocols provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow through the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. Concentrations in conditioned medium of the various mutant follistatins expressed from CHO cells were typically 150–300 ng/ml based on the SPICA assay for free follistatin (23McConnell D.S. Wang Q.F. Sluss P.M. Bolf N. Khoury R.H. Schneyer A.L. Midgley A.R. Reame N.E. Crowley W.F. Padmanabhan V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After partial purification by metal affinity chromatography and exchange into assay buffer, concentrations ranged from 1–5 μg/ml. The principal epitope in the SPICA assay is a well defined sequence (residues 168–178; Fig.1 A) within the second follistatin domain (18Wang Q.F. Keutmann H.T. Schneyer A.L. Sluss P.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3183-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although this region was not directly involved in the mutations employed here, we confirmed that the mutations did not disrupt quantitation by using a second assay directed toward the Myc epitope provided at the C terminus of each preparation. The concentrations obtained by the two methods were in agreement for all N-domain mutants and deletion products. This also implies that any loss of binding activity after mutation cannot be accounted for by a conformational change within the domain II epitope. By competition assay for activin binding, the expressed C-terminal Myc-poly(His) wild-type sequence inhibited labeled activin binding with a dose-response profile that coincided with the purified NIH FS-288 preparation. The wild-type expression product was thus used as reference preparation for all comparisons with mutant follistatins. Fig. 1 Asummarizes the domain structure of human FS-288. Among vertebrate species, the molecule is highly conserved throughout, including the N-terminal (1–63) domain as shown in Fig. 1 B; cysteines and several other residues also are common to related gene products in human (FLRG) and Drosophila (GG1596). Initial mutational analyses of FS-288 were designed to evaluate tolerance for deletion or structural disruption of the N-terminal domain. A molecule comprising exclusively the three follistatin domains (residues 64–288), devoid of the N-terminal domain, was expressed from mammalian cells in concentrations comparable with full-length FS-288. By competition assay, the affinity-processed product was found to bind activin with a potency <5% of expressed wild-type (Fig.2). This response was comparable with equivalent volumes of control medium processed from nontransfected cells. Deletion of the first two residues (Gly-Asn) from the N terminus of FS-288 resulted in a non-parallel dose-dilution curve from which a relative potency estimate of 5–10% of wild-type FS-288 could be estimated (Fig. 2). Substitution of the two N-terminal residues with alanine restored binding activity to 45% of wild-type (TableI).Table IComparative activin binding activity of follistatin-288 mutantsTryptophan residuescharged residuesW4A<0.05R6A1.13 ± .09W4D<0.05K9A1.19 ± .08W4F0.56 ± .04R12A0.92 ± .17W36A0.05 ± .01K18A1.10 ± .17W36D0.07 ± .02K23A0.30 ± .05W36F1.18 ± .31E25A0.99 ± .07W49A0.91 ± .11R31A1.69 ± .26W98A1.21 ± .25K48A0.90 ± .21W258A1.35 ± .18K63A0.61 ± .03Other neutral residuesstructural disruptionL5D0.45 ± .04Δ(G1N2)0.06 ± .03Q7A0.84 ± .10GN(1,2)AA0.45 ± .05Q7E0.46 ± .03CC(26,27)AA<0.05L32D0.72 ± .05(1–63) deletion<0.05LF(46,47)AA1.27 ± .26M50E0.97 ± .03F52A0.19 ± .05Relative potencies (mean ± S.E.) in competition binding assay, expressed as ratio of half-maximal binding inhibition by mutant compared with expressed Myc-tagged wild-type FS-288 (1.00; IC50= 0.30 nm).

Data based on three or more assays for each mutant. In our previous study (18Wang Q.F. Keutmann H.T. Schneyer A.L. Sluss P.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3183-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), activin binding was abolished after reduction of disulfide linkages in full-length FS-288. Disulfide disruption limited to the N-terminal domain was replicated through expression of a construct replacing the adjacent cysteines at positions 26 and 27 with alanine. This would represent disruption of two intrinsic N-domain disulfide linkages because (a) adjacent cysteines normally do not link and (b) follistatin domain disulfides occur exclusively within each individual domain (14Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The Cys-substituted product was expressed at levels comparable with wild-type and migrated identically to the wild-type by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Activin binding was reduced to <5% of the wild-type, an effect approaching that of outright deletion of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2). We first used chemical modification in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis to define the importance of methionine and tryptophan throughout FS-288, followed by additional mutations targeting more explicitly other residues within the N-terminal domain. The three methionine residues, including Met-50 in the N-domain as well as Met-79 and Met-268 in follistatin domains I and III respectively (Fig. 1), were modified by cyanogen bromide treatment which cleaves the peptide chain leaving methionine as a C-terminal homoserine lactone. Sequence analysis (data not shown) confirmed that cleavage was limited to the predicted sites. As shown in Fig. 3 A, activin binding was comparable with that observed after incubation with reaction solvent alone, suggesting that none of the methionines in follistatin are critical for binding. This was confirmed for Met-50 by point mutation to glutamic acid, a residue closely replicating the methionine sulfoxide oxidation product implicated in loss of activity of some native enzymes and hormones (25Neuman N.P. Moore S. Stein W.H. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this case, the M50E product showed the full binding activity of expressed wild-type FS-288 (Fig. 3 B). In evaluating the role of methionine (above), mild oxidation with hydrogen peroxide was employed as an alternative form of modification. Unexpectedly, the oxidized product did not bind activin (Fig. 3 C). Sequence analysis showed loss of the tryptophan residue at position 4, replaced by a more hydrophilic product eluting between Tyr and Pro in the phenylthiohydantoin HPLC profile; similar oxidative changes in tryptophan have been described previously (26Purnananda G. Balasubramanian D. Matsugo S. Saito I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4296-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Hence, at least one tryptophan in FS-288 appeared intolerant to modification to an oxidized form. Systematic mutation of individual tryptophans to Ala or Asp reduced binding activity to 2–5% of the wild-type expression product after substitution for either Trp-4 or Trp-36 within the N-terminal domain (Fig. 4 A). Substitution by Phe restored 50–60% activity to position 4 and full activity to position 36 (Fig. 4 B), consistent with a requirement for a large hydrophobic residue, not specifically tryptophan, at these positions. Alanine replacement of Trp-49 within the N-domain, Trp-98 in follistatin domain I, or 258 in follistatin domain III did not reduce activin binding, as summarized in Table I. Interestingly, the W258A mutation did impair immunoreactivity in the SPICA assay, which detected a concentration only one-fifth that of the Myc-tag radioimmunoassay. This mutation apparently induced conformational changes within the follistatin domains that nonetheless did not affect association with activin (Fig. 4 B). Among other N-domain hydrophobic residues, alanine replacement of Phe-52 resulted in a decrease in activin binding to 19% of wild-type (Table I). On the other hand, Phe-47, as well as Leu-32 and -46, were tolerant to mutation. Minor reductions of approximately 2-fold were found after acidic substitutions for the conserved residues Leu-5 and Gln-7. The several basic (Lys, Arg) residues in the follistatin N-domain were tolerant to alanine mutation with the single exception of Lys-23, which showed a partial reduction in activin binding to 30% of expressed wild-type (Fig. 4 A; Table I). Replacement of Glu-25 was also without effect despite its conservation among a"

Ku is an integral regulatory component of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and many of its actions in the nucleus, including DNA repair, recombination, and transcriptional regulation, occur in concert with the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) (4Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 16Jin S. Inoue S. Weaver D.T. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 221-261PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs is one of a family of large phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related nuclear kinases that also includes the ataxia telangiectasia gene product, ATM, and the TRAPP/PAF400 transcriptional cofactor (4Smith G.C.

DNA-PKcs binds nonspecifically to DNA and is activated from the ends of double-stranded DNA (19Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The interaction of DNA-PKcs with Ku promotes recruitment of the kinase to DNA ends, thereby enhancing its activation (4Smith G.C. Jackson S.P.

Ku also promotes the recruitment and activation of DNA-PKcs from specific DNA sequences (3Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Haché R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 22Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J.

However, even when associated with Ku, DNA-PKcs is an inefficient kinase with akm for peptide substrates in excess of 200 μm (21Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem.

How these in vitro properties of DNA-PK translate to what is presumed to be the specific and targeted phosphorylation of substrates in vivo, remains to be elucidated. At least two mechanisms offer the potential for increasing the specificity and efficiency of substrate phosphorylation by DNA-PK. First, since the affinity of Ku/DNA-PKcs for DNA ends and sequences is several orders of magnitude higher than thekm of DNA-PK for substrates, the colocalization of substrates with DNA-PK in cis on DNA can dramatically enhance their phosphorylation (3Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Haché R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem.

In one specific example, the glucocorticoid receptor is efficiently phosphorylated by DNA-PK in the presence of DNA molecules containing binding sites for both the receptor and Ku/DNA-PKcs. However, when the receptor binding sites are transferred to a second, covalently closed circular DNA molecule to which Ku and DNA-PKcs are not attracted, glucocorticoid receptor phosphorylation is strongly decreased (3Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Haché R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G.

Phosphorylation was also abrogated by introduction of a point mutation that disrupts the binding of glucocorticoid receptor to DNA (22Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G.

The consequence of this DNA sequence-specific phosphorylation is the specific regulation of promoters containing sequences from which the DNA-PK is activated (22Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J.

A second possibility is that substrates may be recruited to Ku/DNA-PKcs through specific protein-protein interactions with components of the DNA-PK complex. Recently, several proteins have been identified as interacting with Ku antigen. For the most part the functional consequences of these interactions remain to be established. At least some of these Ku binding factors (e.g. hGCN5, the progesterone receptor, XRCC4, and c-Abl) are phosphorylated by DNA-PK in vitro (27Barlev N.A. Poltoratsky V. Owen-Hughes T. Ying C. Liu L.

Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of Ku binding to their phosphorylation has not been evaluated. In the present study, we have identified a specific protein-protein interaction between the C terminus of the Ku antigen and the homeodomains of a series of homeodomain proteins that occurs in solution and leads to the recruitment of homeodomain proteins to DNA ends. This interaction contributed to a greater than 50-fold enhancement of the phosphorylation of homeodomain-containing proteins by DNA-PK. These results demonstrate that Ku serves a molecular scaffold for the recruitment of homeodomain proteins to DNA ends for phosphorylation by DNA-PK and suggests that DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation regulates the function of at least some homeodomain proteins in response to DNA damage. Full-length human Ku70 cDNA and Ku80 cDNA were cloned in vector pAS1-Tet (CLONTECH). The two-hybrid Ku70 mutant clones Ku70mt595–600-pAS1 and Ku70mtK595,6N-pAS1 were obtained by cloning the mutated Ku70 cDNA generated by PCR into pAS1. The Jurkat T-cell cDNA library in pGAD-10 was purchased from CLONTECH. Plasmid HOXC4-pACT2 was generated by cloning HOXC4 cDNA (nt 600–1421) isolated from a λgt11 cDNA library (see below) into pACT2. The pGEX2T-HOXC4 HD construct was obtained by inserting the HOXC4 cDNA fragment 1048–1290 (aa 148–227) isolated from clone 18–27 into pGEX2T. Oct-2-pACT2 was constructed by inserting full-length human Oct-2 cDNA in pACT2. To obtain pGEX3X-Oct-1POU, a PCR fragment containing the Oct-1 POU domain (nt 860–1398, aa 268–446) was inserted in pGEX-3X. This construct was used to generate the GST-Oct-1 POU-specific domain mutant (POUsp, aa 268–369) by removing the POU homeodomain by EcoRI digestion and religating the vector. pGEX2T-HOXC4 HD-Oct-1 POUsp was generated by cloning the Oct-1 POU-specific domain (aa 268–369) in theSmaI site of plasmid PGEX2T-HOXC4 HD. pGSTOct-2 POU used in bandshift has been described (33Préfontaine G.G.

Plasmids were transformed as described (34Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) by the lithium acetate method in yeast strain Y190 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, lys2–801, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4d, gal8d, cyh2, LYS2::GAL1UAS, -HIS3TATA-HIS3, URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ) and selected on SD medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His and supplemented with 20 mm 3-aminotriazol (Sigma) to limit spurious activity from the His promoter. After 10–12 days of incubation at 30 °C, transformants were tested for β-galactosidase expression by filter lift assay. About 2.5 × 106 transformants were screened. Positives were restreaked on plates lacking Trp, Leu, and His and retested for β-galactosidase activity. pGAD-10 prey plasmids from positive colonies were then recovered and transformed inEscherichia coli DH5α′ by electroporation, selected on ampicillin plates, and amplified. Purified plasmid DNA was then retransformed in yeast in parallel with Ku70-pAS1 or control Rab3A plasmid (34Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Human HOXC4 cDNA was obtained by screening a λgt11 T cell/Jurkat cDNA library (CLONTECH) with a HOXC4 oligonucleotide spanning nt 871–900. All procedures for screening, isolation, and preparation of phage DNA were performed as described in theCLONTECH protocol. After three rounds of screening, positive phages were grown, and the inserts were analyzed by PCR using primers designed to amplify the full-length cDNA (nt 600–1421) to determine full-length clones. Positive clones were then amplified by PCR using the same primers, cloned into vector pACT2, and sequenced entirely using a LICOR automated sequencer. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed according to standard protocols (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For EMSA purposes, GST-Oct2 POU was eluted from the GST beads. Ku was expressed from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified as described (26Giffin W. Gong W. Schild-Poulter C. Haché R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4065-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All in vitro translated proteins were obtained by using the TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's conditions. In vitro translated deletion mutants were obtained by restricting the plasmids by the appropriate restriction enzyme, or mutant cDNAs were produced by PCR with oligonucleotides containing a T7 promoter fused to the 5′-end of the forward primer. For in vitro translation of cDNAs cloned in pGAD-10 or pACTII, inserts were amplified by PCR using an oligonucleotide complementary to aa 116–124 of the Gal4 activation domain fused to the T7 promoter and an oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′-end of the multiple cloning site of both vectors. To generate C-terminal Ku70 truncation or point mutants from the Ku70-pACT2 plasmid, the T7-Met Gal4 AD primer described above was used as forward primer in combination with Ku70-specific primers. Ku used in binding assays was immunoprecipitated from Jurkat T cell whole cell extracts prepared essentially as described (35Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Ku was performed in WCE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 0.5 μg/ml of Ku70 antibody (clone N3H10; NeoMarkers) followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. To release Ku80 from the complex, beads were incubated in 100 μl of BC0 buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 1 m KCl and 1% sodium deoxycholate for 20 min and washed extensively in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 12% glycerol). Binding of35S-labeled in vitro translated proteins to Ku dimer or Ku70 immobilized on beads was performed in binding buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Complexes were washed three times in WCE buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 35S-labeledin vitro translated proteins (typically 0.2–2 μl of TnT reactions) were added to 100 μg of Jurkat whole cell extract diluted to 60 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h before the addition of the Ku70 antibody. Samples were then processed as above. To test Ku binding to the homeodomain, 0.5–1 μg of GST-Oct-1 POU or GST-HOXC4 HD (as indicated in the figure legends) was mixed with 35S-labeledin vitro translated Ku in binding buffer and processed as above. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (36Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation, about 1 mg of nuclear extract was diluted down to 100 mm KCl with binding buffer and incubated with either Oct-1 antibody (YL15; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or nonspecific antibody (anti-glucocorticoid receptor (BuGR2)). Proteins were transferred on membrane and hybridized successively with antibodies to Ku70 (N3H10; NeoMarkers), Ku80 (clone 111; NeoMarkers) and Oct-1 (C-21; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). EMSA was performed as described (26Giffin W. Gong W. Schild-Poulter C. Haché R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4065-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using32P-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the H2B Oct-2 binding site (5′-AGCTTGCTTATGCAAATAAGGTGGATC-3′) and a nonspecific oligonucleotide (39-mer NS (26Giffin W. Gong W. Schild-Poulter C. Haché R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4065-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). The preparation of the recombinant Ku and GST-Oct2 POU peptide employed in these assays was as previously described (26Giffin W. Gong W. Schild-Poulter C. Haché R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4065-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Préfontaine G.G. Lemieux M.E. Giffin W. Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. LaCasse E. Walker P. Haché R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3416-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Antibodies 111 (NeoMarkers) and YL123 (Upstate Biotechnology) were added at the beginning of the incubations. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate buffer. Phosphorylation of recombinant proteins by purified DNA-PK (Promega) was performed essentially as previously described (26Giffin W. Gong W. Schild-Poulter C. Haché R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4065-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 0.05–2 μg of protein substrate was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm Na2EGTA) in the presence of 20 ng of HaeIII-restricted calf thymus DNA, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 8 units of DNA-PK (Promega). To identify proteins that interact with the Ku70, we screened a Jurkat T cell cDNA library using full-length Ku70 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain as the bait for interacting peptides. Expression of the GalDBDKu70 construct alone or together with Gal4 activation domain was able to activate transcription sufficiently to induce detectable β-galactosidase activity upon overnight incubation (Fig.1 B). This low level of transcriptional activity was consistent with previous reports of a weak acidic activation domain within the N terminus of Ku70 and was abrogated by deletion of the first 57 amino acids. 2C. Schild-Poulter and R. J. G. Haché, unpublished observation. However, this low level of activation did not prevent the detection of interactions with peptides expressed from the Jurkat cDNA library that led to a strong induction of β-galactosidase activity through a specific interaction with Ku70. Approximately 300 strongly positive clones were isolated in the original library screen. 80% of these induced β-galactosidase activity in the absence of the Ku70 bait, while a further 15% were completely negative. DNA sequence analysis of one of the remaining positive clones identified it as encoding a 94-amino acid peptide encompassing the homeodomain of HOXC4 (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, this HOXC4 peptide also displayed a significant ability to activate β-galactosidase expression in the absence of Ku70, with blue color being detectable after 6–7 h (Fig. 1 B). Thus, this clone was almost missed in the secondary screen. Nevertheless, co-expression of this HOXC4 peptide with GalDBDKu70 led to a strongly enhanced activity, with the blue color detectable within 3 h, suggesting the existence of a significant interaction between the two proteins. By contrast, the HOXC4 peptide did not interact with the Rab GTPase expressed from the same vector as a GalDBDfusion protein. Expression of full-length HOXC4 with the Gal activation domain did not induce appreciable β-galactosidase expression, indicating that the nonspecific effect of the homeodomain was suppressed within the full-length protein (Fig. 1 B). Nonetheless, HOXC4GalAct interacted strongly with GalDBDKu70 to induce β-galactosidase activity. This result confirmed the observation of a specific interaction between Ku70 and HOXC4 in yeast. Further, the interaction was specific for Ku70 alone, since no interaction was observed with the Rab or with the Ku80 subunit in the same assay. To begin to probe the interaction between Ku70 and the homeodomain of HOXC4 in greater detail, we examined the specific binding between Ku70 and the homeodomain of HOXC4 in an immunoprecipitation binding assay (Fig. 2 A). For these assays, Ku immunoprecipitates were prepared from whole cell extracts from Jurkat T cells with a Ku70-specific antibody, N3H10 (lanes 1and 2). Ku80 was subsequently stripped from Ku70 monomer by extraction of the immunoprecipitate with a buffer including 1% deoxycholate and 1 m KCl (lane 3). The HOXC4 homeodomain peptide from clone 18–27 produced by in vitrotranslation interacted efficiently with the immunoprecipitated Ku70 monomer (lane 5) and also with the Ku heterodimer (lane 6), illustrating that Ku70 binding was not impeded by Ku dimerization. By contrast, the in vitro translated HOXC4 peptide did not interact with precipitates prepared from Jurkat cell extracts by incubation with protein A-Sepharose alone (lane 7). Homeodomain proteins comprise a large superfamily of transcription factors that regulate multiple aspects of development and are also key regulators of cell homeostasis (37Kornberg T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26813-26816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Manak, J. R., and Scott, M. P. (1994) Dev. Suppl. 1994, 61–71.Google Scholar). The 60-amino acid homeodomain DNA binding motif exhibits an extremely high degree of conservation and serves as a platform for many protein-protein interactions that are crucial to homeodomain protein function (39Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wuthrich K.

Since the Ku70-HOXC4 interaction mapped to the HOXC4 homeodomain, we sought to determine whether Ku70 could interact with other homeodomain proteins. Strikingly, immunoprecipitated Ku70 was bound specifically by all four of the additional homeodomain proteins tested (Fig. 2 B): HOXD4 (41Phelan M.L. Featherstone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8635-8643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a close orthologue to HOXC4 (lanes 1–3); zebrafish Dlx2 (42Akimenko M.A. Ekker M. Wegner J. Lin W. Westerfield M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3475-3486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a more distant family member (lanes 3–6); the POU homeodomain factor Oct-2 (43Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. LeBowitz J.H. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1570-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) (lanes 7–9); and the divergent homeodomain factor Oct-60 (44Hinkley C.S. Martin J.F. Leibham D. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (lanes 10–12). By contrast, CREB (45Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Yun Y. Jameson J.L. Habener J.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1430-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), a basic region/leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factor, did not interact with Ku70 (lanes 13–15). These homeodomain proteins interacted similarly with the Ku heterodimer, while CREB and a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2AA) did not interact with Ku dimer (data not shown). Last, the stringency of the washes employed in preparing the Ku70 for binding, which was sufficient to strip away Ku80 from Ku70, suggested that the interaction between Ku and the homeodomain proteins was likely to be direct. To test the specificity of binding of Ku to these homeodomain proteins under conditions that more closely resembled the cellular milieu, we mixed the in vitro translated homeodomain proteins with the Jurkat whole cell extract prior to immunoprecipitation with the Ku70 antibody (Fig. 2 C). Under these more stringent conditions, Oct-60 binding to Ku was no longer detected, demonstrating that at least some degree of specificity existed for Ku binding within the homeodomain protein family (lanes 10–12). However, HOXD4, Dlx2, and Oct-2 binding remained (lanes 1–9). Further, Ku-homeodomain binding occurred independently from the binding of either factor to DNA, since ethidium bromide treatments sufficient to disrupt protein-DNA interactions had no discernible effect on the Ku-homeodomain interaction (data not shown).

These metabolic reorganizations involve global regulators, many of which serve as DNA architectural factors associated with bacterial chromatin (1Drlica K. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The abundant DNA bending chromatin protein FIS is a global regulator of bacterial metabolism facilitating the adjustment of cells to rapid growth conditions (3Finkel S.E. Johnson R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3257-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 4González-Gil G. Bringmann P. Kahmann R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Nilsson L. Verbeek H. Vijgenboom E. van Drunen C. Vanet A. Bosch L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Xu J. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 938-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of fispositively correlates with the richness of the medium (5Nilsson L. Verbeek H. Vijgenboom E. van Drunen C. Vanet A. Bosch L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such that the amount of FIS protein produced is commensurate with the available metabolic potential. FIS increases the synthesis of stable RNA (tRNA and rRNA) species (7Nilsson L. Vanet A. Vijgenboom E. Bosch L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 9Zhang X. Bremer H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 240-276Google Scholar), adjusting the capacity of the translational machinery to changes in the nutritional supply. FIS is thought to activate the transcription of stable RNA genes by stabilizing local DNA architectures in their promoter regions (10Travers A. Muskhelishvili G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, at many other gene promoters, including the fis promoter, FIS acts as a transcriptional repressor (11Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Browning D.F. Cole J.A. Busby S.J.W. Mol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Ninnemann O. Koch C. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Schneider R.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3166-3175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription of the fis operon sharply increases on subculturing stationary cells in rich medium, then steeply decreases because of autoregulation by FIS, and ceases in late exponential phase (11Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ninnemann O. Koch C. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This pattern of expression during the growth phase is probably optimized, because constitutive fis expression negatively affects the survival of cells under stress conditions (19Osuna R. Lienau D. Hughes K. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of fis is largely regulated at the transcriptional level without any significant contribution offis mRNA decay rates (11Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ninnemann O. Koch C. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Pratt T.S. Steiner T. Feldman L.S. Walker K.A Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6367-6377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected for a gene involved in the modulation of cellular physiology, the expression of fis is subject to a plethora of control mechanisms. The activity of the fis promoter responds both to the growth rate-dependent and stringent control systems (16Ninnemann O. Koch C. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This latter abrogates stable RNA production on limitation of amino acid availability and is mediated by the nucleotide ppGpp (21Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. The Stringent Response in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). However, the role of ppGpp in the shut-off of fis expression has been questioned in the study that showed that deletion of the genes for both ppGpp synthases (relA and spoT) does not change the growth phase expression pattern of fis (11Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thefis promoter is also exquisitely sensitive to changes in the superhelical density of DNA and is thought to respond to growth phase-dependent fluctuations in DNA topology (22Schneider R. Travers A. Muskhelishvili G. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, the fis promoter activity is dependent on the availability of the initiating nucleoside triphosphates (23Walker K.A. Atkins C.L. Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is positively regulated by the DNA bending chromatin protein IHF (20Pratt T.S. Steiner T. Feldman L.S. Walker K.A Osuna R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6367-6377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CRP protein is another global regulator that, on exhaustion of glucose or its analogues, switches the cellular metabolism to the utilization of alternative carbon sources, such as lactose, maltose, and arabinose (24Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ullmann A. Danchin A. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1983; 15: 1-53Google Scholar). As glucose is consumed the intracellular levels of cAMP rise, and an active cAMP-CRP complex forms, which then modulates the activity of numerous genes at the transcriptional level (24Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26de Crombrugghe B. Busby S. Buc H. Science. 1984; 224: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 27Ishizuka H. Hanamura A. Kunimura T. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In growing bacterial cells the level of cAMP sharply increases on transition to stationary phase (28Buettner M.J. Spitz E. Rickenberg H.V. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 14: 1068-1073Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the majority of the effects of CRP and FIS on gene expression are probably exerted under different growth conditions. Nevertheless, there are many examples of genes regulated by both FIS and CRP (13Claret L. Rouvière-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Xu J. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3166-3175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Caramel A. Schnetz K. Mol Microbiol. 2000; 36: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30McLeod S.M. Xu J. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4180-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The expression of most of the FIS-regulated genes involved in the catabolism of sugars and nucleic acids is also dependent on the cAMP-CRP complex (4González-Gil G. Bringmann P. Kahmann R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Notably, the activity of the crppromoter itself is modulated by both the cAMP-CRP complex and FIS during the growth phase (15González-Gil G. Kahmann R. Muskhelishvili G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Aiba H. Cell. 1983; 32: 141-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 32Hanamura A. Aiba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4413-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This control of crpexpression is thought to operate by changing the composition of transcriptional complexes formed in the crp promoter region in response to the physiological state of the cell (15González-Gil G. Kahmann R. Muskhelishvili G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the effect of CRP on the expression of the fis gene. We demonstrate that CRP modulates thefis promoter activity, supporting the transient mode offis expression during the growth phase. In analogy tocrp regulation, this modulation involves alterations in the composition of functional nucleoprotein complexes formed by FIS, CRP, and RNA polymerase in the fis regulatory region. Chemicals and enzymes used in this work were obtained from commercial sources. Bacterial strains used in this study wereEscherichia coli K12 derivatives. The genotype of CSH50 isara Δ(lac pro) thi rpsL (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The construction of CSH50Δfis is described elsewhere (34Koch C. Vanderkerckhove J. Kahmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4237-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This strain carries a kanamycin resistance gene substituted forfis. CSH50Δcrp is described in González-Gil et al. (15González-Gil G. Kahmann R. Muskhelishvili G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This strain carries a streptomycin resistance determinant. All strains were grown in 2× YT medium (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl/liter, pH 7.4). Single colonies were isolated on YT plates (8 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, 15 g of agar/liter). The construct pFP2 is described by Ninnemann et al. (16Ninnemann O. Koch C. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For construction of pWN1 (fis promoter lacZfusion), a fis promoter fragment (positions −308 to +106) was PCR1 amplified with the primers LfispRI5′ (5′-CGGAATTCCGGTCGTAAGAATTAACCTTC-3′) and ORF13′ (5′-AGGTCTGTCTGTAATGCCAG-3′) using E. coli CSH50 chromosomal DNA as a template. For the construction of pWN3 (divergent promoterlacZ fusion), a fis promoter fragment encompassing positions −308 to +106 was PCR amplified with the primers pfis-308op-NruI (5′- GCCTATCGCGACGTAAGAAATTAACCTTCGCAT-3′) and ORF1-EcoRI (5′-CGGAATTCAGGTCTGTCTGTAATGCCAG-3′) usingE. coli chromosomal DNA as a template. These fragments were cloned in EcoRI/NruI sites of ptyrTlac (17Schneider R. Travers A. Kutateladze T. Muskhelishvili G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and thereby the tyrT promoter was replaced by thesefis promoter DNA fragments. A two-step PCR method using mutagenic oligonucleotides andPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was employed for site-directed mutagenesis (35Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 26: 125-128Crossref Scopus (639) Google Scholar). To construct pWN-75A/C, the primer pfis-87op comprising positions −87 to −64 and containing an A-to-C base substitution at −75 on the top strand (5′-CATTTTAAATGCCATTCTTTGATC-3′) and primer ORF13′ were used to initiate the first round PCR on the pWN1 template. The resulting PCR product was then used as a “megaprimer” together with the primer LfispRI5′ for the second round PCR on the pWN1 template and the product cloned in EcoRI/NruI sites of ptyrTlac. For construction of pWN3–75A/C, the pWN1–75A/C DNA was PCR amplified with the primers pfis-308op-NruI and ORF1-EcoRI and cloned inEcoRI/NruI sites of ptyrTlac. FIS and RNA polymerase were isolated as described previously (36Koch C. Kahmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15673-15678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Metzger W. Schickor P. Meier T. Werel W. Heumann H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Purified CRP was kindly provided by Dr. A. Kolb. Northern analyses were performed as described in Schneider et al. (17Schneider R. Travers A. Kutateladze T. Muskhelishvili G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The concentration of RNA in different samples was detected spectrophotometrically, normalized for each sample, and verified on a reference gel, using rRNA as loading control. For Northern analysis 15 μg of RNA/lane was separated on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of glyoxal and transferred to Hybond N+ filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were hybridized overnight with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes made by Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As template DNA for the Megaprime reactions served a BglII/HindIIIfis fragment cut out of pADfis (38Deufel A. Hermann T. Kahmann R. Muskhelishvili G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3832-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and an enofragment, prepared by PCR amplification of a 1283-bp internal fragment of the E. coli enolase gene, using the primer eno5 (5′-AGTCTTATGCCTGGCCTTG-3′) and eno3 (5′-CATCGGTCGTGAAATCATCG-3′). The signals obtained in three separate experiments were detected by phosphorimaging (PhosphorImager Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics) and quantified using the IMAGE-QUANT software, averaged, and normalized to the value obtained for the 5-min time point for one of the strains. Western blotting was carried out essentially as described earlier (39Muskhelishvili G. Travers A.A. Heumann H. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1446-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), except that 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used for the detection of FIS and methanol (10%) was included in the buffers during electrotransfer of proteins onto polyvinylidendifluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). FIS was detected by using the FIS-specific polyclonal (rabbit) antibody (39Muskhelishvili G. Travers A.A. Heumann H. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1446-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The β subunit of RNAP was detected by using a RNAP β subunit-specific polyclonal (goat) antibody (a generous gift of Hermann Heumann). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat (Promega) and rabbit (Sigma) IgG-specific secondary antibodies were used for detection with an ECL+Plus kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The autoradiographs were scanned and quantified by NIH-IMAGE software. The conditions of DNase I footprinting were as described earlier (39Muskhelishvili G. Travers A.A. Heumann H. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1446-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fis promoter region (−185 to +65) was PCR-amplified using the primers fis3 (5′-GATTTCTGAGCTGATATTGTC-3′) and fis5 (5′-AAAGAAAAATTGAGAACTTACTC-3′) and the pFP2 DNA as a template. The primer fis3 was uniquely end-labeled by [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The fragments obtained were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a neutral 0.5× TBE gel. The incubation mixture contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm cAMP (whenever necessary), and proteins as indicated in a 20-μl volume. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, DNase I and MgCl2 were added to 2 μg/ml and 10 mm final concentrations, respectively. The reaction was terminated after 10 s by adding 80 μl of the solution containing 0.5% SDS and 50 mm EDTA. After digestion by proteinase K for 45 min at 45 °C and phenol extraction, the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, dissolved in loading dye, and analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Protected and hypersensitive bands were identified by using the Maxam-Gilbert G-ladder (40Maxam A. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5450) Google Scholar) of the same DNA fragment as reference. The reactions on linear templates were assembled and processed similarly to those used for DNase I footprinting. The reactions were carried out as described by Schneider et al. (17Schneider R. Travers A. Kutateladze T. Muskhelishvili G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), except that 100 μmeach of CTP and GTP were included in the incubation mixtures. For the reactions with supercoiled templates, the plasmid DNA (500 ng) and proteins as indicated were incubated in 50 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm each of CTP and GTP. After footprinting the plasmid DNA was used for five cycles of PCR (41Dumitru I. McNeil J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with the 5′-radiolabeled primer ORF1. The reaction products were analyzed on 6% sequencing gels. The signals caused by permanganate reactivity of bases were visualized and quantitated as described above. Supercoiled plasmid pWN1 and pWN-75A/C were used for in vitro transcription and primer extension reactions according to Lazarus and Travers (42Lazarus L.R. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mRNA obtained after in vitro transcription was divided in three parts and used for primer extension by reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, RNase H minus, Fermentas) with radioactively end-labeled primers ORF1 for fismRNA, −257op (5′-GAGCAAGCTCACAAAAGGC-3′) for divergent transcript and bla3B4 (5′-CAGGAAGGCAAAATGCCGC-3′) for the blatranscript. The extension with primers ORF1, −257op and bla3B4 yields 106-, 149-, and 100-bp fragments, respectively. After primer extension the samples were loaded on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by phosphorimaging. The length of the transcripts was estimated by using corresponding dideoxy sequencing reactions as a reference. The amount of the fis and divtranscript produced was quantitated and normalized to that ofbla. In vivo DMS footprinting was performed essentially as described by Schneider et al.(43Schneider R. Travers A. Muskhelishvili G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). DMS (0.2 or 0.4%) was added in 1 ml of cell cultures on transition to stationary phase (A600 = 1.5–2) grown at 37 °C and incubation continued at 32 °C for 5 min. The purified plasmid DNA (500 ng) was used as a template for five cycles of PCR (41Dumitru I. McNeil J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with 5′-radiolabeled primer 5′-CTGAGCTGATATTGTCCG-3′ priming about 60 bp downstream of the fis operon transcription initiation site. The DMS footprinting reaction in vitro was performed by adding 1 μl of DMS to supercoiled pWN1 plasmid DNA (500 ng) and proteins as indicated in a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm cAMP for 1 min at room temperature in a 100-μl volume. The DNA pellets were dried and used for PCR as described above. The PCR products were analyzed on 6% sequencing gels and visualized by autoradiography. A dideoxy sequencing ladder was used to identify the position of protected guanines. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:30 in fresh 2× YT medium. Samples taken at the indicated times were assayed for β-galactosidase activity following the protocol of Sadler and Novick (44Sadler J.R. Novick A. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 305-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase units were multiplied by 1000 to make them equivalent to those of Miller (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). In our experiments we used the E. coli strain CSH50 and its derivative CSH50Δcrp lacking the crp gene. After subculturing cells in rich medium (a procedure that hereafter we term a nutritional shift-up) the wild type and crp cells grew similarly until the late exponential phase. Although the transition to stationary growth phase occurred at lower optical densities in thecrp mutant, both cultures achieved similar densities in late stationary phase (Fig. 1 A). However, when the mutant and wild type strains were grown in mixed cultures, the wild type demonstrated a clear advantage, because thecrp mutant cells were rapidly selected out (Fig.1 B). To evaluate the effect of crp on fis expression, total cellular RNA was isolated at intervals after the shift-up from wild type andcrp cell cultures having similar optical densities. The amount of fis mRNA was quantitated by Northern analyses. In wild type cells the typical pattern of fis expression was observed, with an initial sharp increase followed by a steep decrease and an almost complete shut-off in 120 min (Fig.2, A and B). Incrp mutant cells the amount of fis message was elevated at the earliest time point measured (5 min) but achieved its maximum levels later than in wild type. Most remarkably, incrp cells substantial amounts of fis transcript were detectable in late exponential phase (after 120 min), suggesting that the down-regulation of fis is impaired. During the analyzed time period both strains grew equally well (Fig.1 A), and in addition, we did not observe any significant differences between the strains in the expression pattern ofeno mRNA (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Consistent with the Northern data, the crp cells transformed with the fis promoter-lacZ fusion construct pWN1 (containing the extended fis promoter region from position −308 to +106) reproducibly demonstrated a slow decrease of β-galactosidase activity during the growth phase (see Fig.7 C).Figure 7A divergent promoter is located in thefis regulatory region. A, primer extension analysis of total RNA (10 μg) extracted from CSH50 cells (lane 1) and of the transcripts produced from pWN1 in vitro (lanes 2–4) with the primer pfis-257op. The concentration of RNAP in lanes 2–4, was 15, 30, and 50 nm, respectively. The dideoxy sequencing ladder performed with the same primer on pWN1 is shown. B, effect of the down mutation in the −35 element of the divergent promoter. In theleft panel the result of primer extension of RNAs producedin vitro from the divergent, fis, andbla (used as an internal control) promoters on pWN1 and pWN-75A/C is shown. The amount of the fis and divtranscript produced was quantitated and normalized to that ofbla. In the right panel the effect of the mutation on the KMnO4 reactivity of the divergent promoter (bottom strand) and fis promoter (top strand) after binding of RNAP is shown. Lanes 1,2, 5, and 6 show the reactions with pWN1. Lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8show the reactions with pWN-75A/C. C, the time course of β-galactosidase expression driven from the fis and divergent promoters using the pWN1 and pWN3 constructs in growing wild type and crp cells. All values were normalized by setting the amount of β-galactosidase produced from pWN1 in each overnight (time 0) wild type and crp cell cultures at 100%. The data were derived from values obtained in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the impaired down-regulation of fisexpression is due to a lower concentration of FIS in mutant cells, we compared the content of FIS in wild type and crp cell extracts. However, by quantitative Western analyses we detected increased amounts of FIS protein in crp cell extracts 60 and 120 min after the shift-up (Fig. 2 C). Thus higherfis mRNA and higher FIS protein levels persist in exponentially growing crp cells. Taken together, these data suggest that crp is involved in the maintenance of the growth phase expression pattern of fis. The fis promoter regulatory region contains sequences matching the CRP binding site consensus (11Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether CRP directly binds at the fis promoter, we carried out DNase I footprinting studies. Addition of CRP to linear fis promoter DNA fragments protected the positions −57/−58 from DNase I cleavage and increased DNase I cleavage around positions −60, −70, and −110 with respect to the start point of transcription at +1 (Fig.3 A, lanes 5 and6). Inspection of this region revealed two sequences matching the CRP binding site consensus (24Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one (site I) centered at position −62.5 (5′-TTTGAtccatcTCAGA-3′) and another (site II) at position −103.5 (5′-TATGAgtaattaTCGCA-3′) (Fig. 3 C). Because only DNase I hypersensitivity indicative of DNA distortion but no extensive protection of these putative sites by CRP was observed, it appears that CRP does not bind tightly. However, we confirmed CRP binding in both these regions by DMS footrpinting experiments, showing a CRP-dependent modification of Gs at −67, −77, −97, −106, and −108 (Fig. 3 C; data not shown). To investigate the effect of CRP binding on the interaction of RNAP with the fis promoter, we first footprinted thefis promoter with RNAP alone. Binding of RNAP increased DNase I cleavage at two positions (−37 and −46) near the −35 element of the fis promoter and protected from DNase I cleavage the upstream region between −65 and −125. An additional DNase-hypersensitive site was induced around position −88 (Fig. 3A,lane 7). The observed pattern confirms a previous report on the binding of two closely spaced RNAP molecules with different affinities at the fis promoter (11Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of CRP abolished both the DNase I cleavage around −88 and the protection of the upstream region by RNAP (Fig. 3 A, comparelanes 7–10), indicating that CRP precludes the binding of RNAP to the upstream DNA. By contrast, the protection of thefis core promoter by RNAP was enhanced (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 7–9), suggesting that binding of CRP stabilizes RNAP at the fis core promoter. However, at higher CRP concentrations the protection of the fis promoter by RNAP was abolished (compare lanes 9 and 10). This latter effect of high CRP concentrations is most probably due to nucleation of binding in the region overlapping the −10 hexamer of thefis promoter, as observed by DMS footprinting (Fig.3 C; data not shown). To gain more information on the interactions between CRP, FIS, and polymerase at the fis promoter, we footprinted FIS alone and also in combination with CRP and RNAP. On addition of FIS the first site occupied was the high affinity binding site II centered at −42 and overlapping the −35 region of the fis promoter (Fig.3 A, lane 1). When FIS and CRP were added in combination, the DNase I hypersensitivity around positions −38/−39 induced by binding of FIS at site II and the protection of FIS site III were noticeably enhanced (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 13–15). However, CRP did not increase the FIS protection in the downstream region (e.g. position −31) observed at high FIS concentrations (compare lanes 1-3 withlanes 13–15). This suggests that CRP may specific"
https://openalex.org/W2039111226,"Pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D), a lung host defense protein, is assembled as multimers of trimeric subunits. Trimerization of SP-D monomers is required for high affinity saccharide binding, and the oligomerization of trimers is required for many of its functions. A peptide containing the α-helical neck region can spontaneously trimerize in vitro. However, it is not known whether this sequence is necessary for the complete cellular assembly of disulfide-cross-linked, trimeric subunits and dodecamers. For the present studies, we synthesized mutant cDNAs with deletions or site-directed substitutions in the neck domain of rat SP-D, and examined the assembly of the newly synthesized proteins after transfection of CHO-K1 cells. The neck domain contains three “classical” heptad repeat motifs with leucine residues at the “d position,” and a distinctive C-terminal repeat previously suggested to drive trimeric chain association. Deletion of the highly conserved core of the latter repeat (FSRYLKK) did not interfere with the secretion of dodecamers with lectin activity. By contrast, deletion of the entire neck domain or deletion of one or two amino-terminal repeats resulted in defective molecular assembly. The secreted proteins eluted in the position of monomers by gel filtration under nondenaturing conditions. In addition, the neck + carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D was necessary and sufficient for the trimerization of a heterologous collagen sequence located amino-terminal to the trimeric coiled-coil. These studies provide strong evidence that the amino-terminal heptad repeats of the neck domain are necessary for the intracellular, trimeric association of SP-D monomers and for the assembly and secretion of functional dodecamers.

In addition, recent in vivostudies strongly suggest that SP-D plays important roles in immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung and in the regulation of surfactant homeostasis (4Botas C.

SP-D is predominantly assembled as a dodecamer consisting of four subunits cross-linked by disulfide bonds. Each SP-D subunit consists of four major domains: an amino-terminal cross-linking domain, an uninterrupted triple helical collagen domain, a trimeric coiled-coil or neck domain (N), and a mannose subtype, C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Trimerization of SP-D monomers (43 kDa, reduced) is a prerequisite for high affinity saccharide binding, and the oligomerization of trimeric subunits is required for many of its known biological activities (10Crouch E.C. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A trimeric CRD constitutes a high affinity saccharide-binding site, and multimers of trimeric subunits are required to mediate bridging interactions between multivalent particulate ligands, such as bacteria and viral particles. A mutant form of SP-D that cannot form amino-terminal disulfide cross-links (RrSP-Dser15,20) is secreted as trimeric subunits and binds to known saccharide ligands but lacks the ability to aggregate viral particles or other particulate ligands (11Brown-Augsburger P.

SP-D is synthesized and secreted by type II pneumocytes and nonciliated bronchiolar cells in vivo. However, the ability of isolated epithelial cells to synthesize and secrete SP-D is rapidly lost during cell culture. We have, therefore, utilized CHO-K1 cells transfected with SP-D cDNAs as a model system for studying the assembly and constitutive secretion of SP-D (11Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18912-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Biosynthetic studies have shown that the rate of secretion of wild-type SP-D by CHO-K1 cells is comparable with that observed for freshly isolated rat type II cells (13Brown-Augsburger P. Chang D. Rust K. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18912-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recombinant wild-type SP-Ds are not distinguishable from the natural protein by a wide variety of biochemical and biological criteria (11Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K.

In particular, recombinant rat and human SP-Ds synthesized in the presence of ascorbic acid are secreted as disulfide-cross-linked dodecamers with normally hydroxylated and glycosylated, pepsin-resistant, triple helical collagen domains. These molecules are able to participate in CRD-dependent interactions with microorganisms and phagocytic cells. Subcellular fractionation and pulse-chase experiments using this model demonstrated that the newly synthesized chains of wild-type recombinant rat SP-D rapidly associate within the cell to form disulfide-cross-linked trimers with lectin activity (13Brown-Augsburger P. Chang D. Rust K. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18912-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These trimeric subunits subsequently undergo a much slower process of subunit oligomerization with disulfide rearrangement leading to the formation of disulfide-cross-linked dodecamers. Assembly of dodecamers occurs within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, with rapid transit through the Golgi immediately prior to secretion. Thus, trimerization is a rapid event that appears necessary for the subsequent formation of disulfide-cross-linked dodecamers. Other studies have shown that a 35-amino acid polypeptide corresponding to the sequence immediately carboxyl-terminal to the collagen domain of human SP-D is sufficient for the stable but reversible association of the peptides to form trimeric complexes in vitro (16Hoppe H.J. Barlow P.N. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This sequence, which lacks cysteine, predicts an α-helical coiled-coil containing four uninterrupted heptad repeats with hydrophobic residues in a 3-4-3-4 spacing. When cDNAs encoding the contiguous neck + CRD domains are expressed in bacteria as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins, the recombinant proteins are isolated as trimeric CRDs (17Kishore U. Wang J.Y. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Lim B.L. Wang J.Y. Holmskov U. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Such fusion proteins show lectin activity and demonstrate some of the CRD-dependent activities of the intact protein, including chemotactic activity (19Cai G.Z. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Longmore W.J. Moxley M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L131-L136PubMed Google Scholar) and certain antimicrobial activities in vitro (20Hartshorn K.L. White M.R. Shepherd V. Reid K. Jensenius J.C. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 17: L1156-L1166Crossref Google Scholar) andin vivo (21Hickling T.P. Bright H. Wing K. Gower D. Martin S.L. Sim R.B. Malhotra R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3478-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the neck + CRD domains of human SP-D was solved (22Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The neck region of SP-D is assembled as a trimeric coiled-coil, like that of the homologous serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL) (23Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 24Sheriff S. Chang C.Y. Ezekowitz R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 94: 789-794Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The neck region of hSP-D contains approximately eight α-helical turns prior to helix termination at Pro235 (see Fig. 1). Residues Val204, Leu207, Val211, Leu214, Val218, Leu221, Phe225, and Tyr228 of hSP-D are buried within the coiled-coil at the a and dpositions of the repeats. Of particular interest is the carboxyl-terminal repeat, which contains aromatic side chains in two consecutive core positions (Phe225 at the aposition and Tyr228 at the d position). For several reasons, the authors suggested that the aromatic residues, particularly the aromatic ring of the buried tyrosine, are instrumental in driving the oligomerization of the coiled-coil to an exclusively trimeric assembly (22Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Together these observations provide strong circumstantial evidence that the coiled-coil conformation of the neck domain is sufficient for trimerization of the neck + CRD domains and suggest a particularly crucial role for the carboxyl-terminal repeat in driving trimeric assembly of SP-D monomers. However, it is not known whether these sequences are necessary for the complete intracellular assembly of disulfide-cross-linked trimeric subunits. In these studies, we examined the assembly of rSP-D in CHO-K1 transfected with selected neck domain mutants. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that the C-terminal heptad repeat of the neck domain plays a critical role in the assembly of trimeric subunits. We also examined the assembly of a chimeric protein consisting of the amino-terminal propeptide domain of type IIA procollagen (25Sandell L.J. Morris N. Robbins J.R. Goldring M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) linked to the neck and CRD domains of SP-D to determine whether the carboxyl-terminal domains are sufficient to mediate trimerization of a heterologous amino-terminal, collagen-containing sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the PCR overlap extension method using a full-length rat SP-D cDNA (11Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C.

Briefly, forward and reverse primers containing the desired substitutions or splice junctions were synthesized (Washington University School of Medicine, Oligonucleotide Synthesis Center) (see Fig. 1 and TableI). PCRs were performed using ∼200 ng of ScaI-linearized rSP-D/pGEM-3Z template in reaction buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 5 units of Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Separate reactions containing the required primer pairs (Table I, PCR1 and PCR2) were performed for ∼25 cycles at an annealing temperature of 52 °C. The products were then gel-purified, and the final reaction with the outside primers (Table I, PCR3) was performed for 30 cycles at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. The resulting DNA was purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), digested with EcoRI, and subcloned into pGEM-3Z. Clones were sequenced to verify the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of any additional mutations.Table IPlasmidRxnPrimersTemplateRrSP-Dd203–2301Sp6 + Oligo 46 (5′-agggaagagcgctggaagtccactttcgccttt-3′)rSP-D2T7 + Oligo 47 (5′-agtggacttccagcgctcttccctgatggccaa-3′)rSP-DRrSP-Dd225–2301Sp6 + Oligo 7 (5′-aatggaaaacttcagcgtctagaggccgcgctcttc-3′)rSP-D2T7 + Oligo 8 (5′-ttggccatcagggaagagcgcggcctctagacgctg-3′)rSP-DRrSP-Dd207–2141Sp6 + Oligo 33283 (5′-cttccagacagtgctgctaatggaaaactt-3′)rSP-D2T7 + Oligo 33282 (5′-aagttttccattagcagcactgtctggaag-3′)rSP-DRrSP-Dd214–2211Sp6 + Oligo 33214 (5′-cagcagatggaggctgaggctgccttt-3′)rSP-D2T7 + Oligo 33215 (5′-aaaggcagcctcagcctccatctgctg-3′)rSP-DRrSP-Dd207–2211Sp6 + Oligo 66 (5′-aggcagcctcagcagcactgtctggaagtccac-3′)rSP-D2T7 + Oligo 67 (5′-cagtgctgctgacgctgccttttctcgctataa-3′)rSP-DIIA/SP-D1Oligo 57 (5′-ggtacgaattcatgattcgcctcggg) + Oligo 58 (5′-cagcactgtccattggtccttgcat)IIA2T7 + Oligo 59 (5′-aggaccaatggacagtgctgctctg-3′)rSP-D3Oligo 57 + T7 Open table in a new tab A chimeric cDNA encoding the entirety of the human type IIA procollagen amino-terminal peptide and the neck and CRD domains of rat SP-D was constructed by overlap extension (Table I). cDNA encoding full-length IIA aminopropeptide (exons 1–8) of human type IIA procollagen was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from RNA isolated from normal adult articular chondrocytes grown in culture. Specific upstream and downstream primers (5′-TAAGGATCCGCGGTGAGCCATGATTCGCCTCGGG GCTCCCCAGTC -3′; 5′-CCGTCTAGACTACATTGGTCCTTGCATTACTCCCAACTGG-3′) were designed using the human pro-α1 type II collagen gene sequence (L10347). Mutated rSP-D cDNAs and chimeric sequences were excised from pGEM-3Z withEcoRI and subcloned into the corresponding site within the multiple cloning site of pEE14 (14Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction mapping and/or DNA sequencing were used to determine the orientation of the subclones. Transfection of pEE14 constructs into CHO-K1 cells and selection of stably expressing cell lines was performed as previously described (14Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To collect secreted recombinant proteins for isolation and structural analysis, 50 confluent 100-mm plates were incubated for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml fresh ascorbic acid. Conditioned medium containing secreted recombinant proteins was collected, and any insoluble material cellular was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Proteins were identified by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and characterized by immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody to rat SP-D (26Persson A. Chang D. Rust K. Moxley M. Longmore W. Crouch E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6361-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were transferred to six-well plates at 0.5 × 106 cells/well in Glascow's minimum essential medium and allowed to grow to ∼50% confluence. The cells were then transfected with 3 μg of purified DNA in Glascow's minimum essential medium in the presence of 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and in the absence of serum, antibiotics, or phenol red. Incubations were performed for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for 16–24 h in the presence of fresh ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml). The medium was collected and clarified by brief centrifugation, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. For some experiments characterizing the mutants, 10 mm iodoacetamide was also added to prevent disulfide bond formation between unpaired sulfhydryls present in the incompletely oligomerized proteins. For immunoblotting, 35 μl out of a total volume of 1 ml was resolved on a 0.75-mm minigel. To examine intracellular proteins by immunoblotting, cells from each well were harvested directly into 500 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and immediately boiled to inactivate proteases. Samples were briefly stored at −20 °C pending SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Nearly confluent cell cultures were briefly washed in fresh serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 5 μCi/mll-[14C]proline (283 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The medium was harvested as described under “Transient Transfection Assays,” and secreted recombinant protein was isolated from the culture medium by gel filtration chromatography. Liquid scintillation counting was used to monitor the elution of radiolabeled proteins. Aliquots of the fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Secreted recombinant proteins containing the SP-D CRD were isolated from the culture medium using maltosyl-agarose affinity chromatography as previously described. The medium was dialyzed extensively against 0.15m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), containing 10 mm EDTA, recalcified immediately before chromatography, and applied to a column of maltosyl-agarose equilibrated with TBS containing 20 mm CaCl2. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining, immunoblotting, or autoradiography as appropriate. Proteins were concentrated by maltosyl-agarose chromatography and subsequently characterized by gel filtration chromatography under nondenaturing conditions on A15m (27Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For some experiments characterizing incompletely oligomerized proteins, an A5m column was used. The gel filtration columns were calibrated with blue dextran, purified rat SP-D dodecamers, thyroglobulin, rat SP-D trimeric subunits (RrSP-Dser15,20), bovine serum albumin, and lysozyme. The state of oligomerization of SP-D dodecamers and trimeric subunits was originally established by ultrastructural and biochemical analysis of natural and recombinant SP-D proteins resolved under identical conditions (27Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining or autoradiography as required. Yields were calculated based on the recovery of purified protein. Proteins were quantified using a dye-binding assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Approximately 100 μg of IIA/SPD fusion protein was digested overnight at 37 °C with recombinant human matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9; a gift from Dr. R. Senior, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University, St. Louis) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100. MMP-9 cleaves within exon 8 of the IIA propeptide on either side of Gln182 and Met199 (see Fig.8). 2N. Fukui, A. McAlinden, and L. Sandell, unpublished observations. The IIA propeptide was separated from the neck + CRD fragments by maltosyl-agarose chromatography. Immunoblotting of the SP-D mutants was performed using rabbit anti-rat SP-D and an indirect, biotinylated secondary antibody/streptavidin-peroxidase detection system (27Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of collagenase digests of rat SP-D has shown that the anti-rat polyclonal antibody preferentially binds to the carboxyl-terminal domain. The IIA domain was detected using rabbit anti-human type IIA procollagen, which recognizes the cysteine-rich domain encoded by exon 2 of the type II aminopropeptide (42Oganesian A. Zhu Y. Sandell L.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected using a goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody and SuperSignal® chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Covalent cross-linking was performed using bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce). Briefly, increasing amounts of bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (0, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mm final concentration) were added to IIA propeptide (0.1 μg), IIA/SPD fusion protein (1 μg), or the IIA propeptide secreted by HEK 293 cells stably transfected with a cDNA encoding the IIA propeptide sequence. Reactions were performed for 1 h at room temperature and terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing Tris-HCl (0.5 m). Samples were boiled for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE in the absence of sulfhydryl reduction. Silver staining or immunoblotting was used to identify the cross-linked proteins. For these studies, we examined the assembly of recombinant mutant RrSP-D proteins containing deletions or substitutions within the neck domain. In particular, we compared the structure of wild type and mutant SP-D by CHO-K1 cells transiently or stably transfected with the wild type and mutant cDNAs. A mammalian expression system is essential for such studies. Prokaryotic and insect cells do not support normal post-translational modification and folding of the collagen domain. In order to simplify the analysis, we utilized rat SP-D cDNAs because the secreted protein is almost exclusively assembled as dodecamers (14Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the human SP-D cDNA is secreted as a mixture of dodecamers, higher order oligomers, and trimeric species (15Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L753-L762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the primary sequence of the neck domain is very highly conserved among all known SP-D proteins. There is nearly complete conservation of residues predicted to contribute to the formation of a stable α-helical coiled-coil, including the distinctive aromatic residues (Phe225 and Tyr228) of the C-terminal heptad repeat. Deletion analysis was first used to examine the functional role of the neck as well as the contributions of specific sequences within the neck domain. We initially examined the importance of the neck domain for SP-D secretion and assembly by stably expressing a deletion mutant extending from the C-terminal end of the collagen domain through Lys230 (RrSP-Dd203–230). This site of termination corresponds to the last residue encoded by exon 7 of the human gene (28Crouch E. Rust K. Veile R. Donis-Keller H. Grosso L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2976-2983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and position f of the C-terminal heptad repeat of the neck domain. Both transient and stable transfections gave recoveries of medium protein comparable with that obtained for parallel transfections using the wild-type rSP-D cDNA (data not shown; see also Fig. 6). Analysis of the secreted protein by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting showed a major band migrating near the position of wild-type monomers in the absence of sulfhydryl reduction (Fig. 2,lane 2). Disulfide-cross-linked trimers that characterize secreted wild-type dodecamers were not seen; however, less intense bands with the expected mobility of dimers were observed (Fig. 2,lane 2, arrow D). When examined by SDS-PAGE in the presence of dithiothreitol, a single component was observed; this species migrated slightly more slowly than the unreduced protein (not shown, but see below). In subsequent experiments, we found that the proportion of the cross-linked components was reduced by the addition of iodoacetamide to the culture medium prior to SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Because untrimerized, mutant monomers must contain free sulfhydryls in their amino-terminal domains, cross-linking probably occurs when the protein is concentrated in the stacking gel.Figure 2Characterization of the neck deletion mutant (RrSP-Dd203–230) in transient transfection assays. CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with RrSP-Dd203–230. The conditioned medium was harvested as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of the recombinant protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE in the absence of dithiothreitol and visualized by immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, rat SP-D trimeric standard; lane 2, RrSP-Dd203–230.

Secreted wild-type SP-D or trimeric subunits of SP-D (e.g. RrSP-Dser15,20) bind tightly and are recovered following elution with EDTA or competing sugar. However, in preliminary experiments, essentially no protein was recovered in the EDTA-eluate, and the assessment of the unbound fractions was complicated by the presence of serum proteins. We therefore monitored the elution of the protein by immunoassay. As shown in Fig. 3, essentially all of the immunoreactive RrSP-Dd203–230 was unbound and recovered in the wash. Because monomers do not bind efficiently to maltosyl-agarose, our data suggested the absence of trimeric subunits, rather than the production of trimers lacking disulfide cross-links in their amino-terminal domains. To examine the extent of noncovalent oligomerization, we performed gel filtration chromatography under nondenaturing conditions on A15m- or A5m-agarose. For these studies, we directly applied metabolically labeled proteins in dialyzed conditioned medium to the column. This approach was used to circumvent the need to concentrate the medium and to preclude interference by serum proteins expected to elute near the recombinant protein. As predicted, radiolabeled RrSP-Dd203–230 eluted late and within the included volume, after the position of elution of authentic trimeric subunits and slightly earlier than bovine serum albumin (68 kDa) (Fig.4 A). Although the theoretical molecular mass of monomers is ∼40 kDa, even non-triple helical collagenous sequences assume a more extended conformation in solution and have a higher hydrodynamic radius than globular proteins of comparable mass. However, given the absence of corresponding dimeric standards, the elution profile alone does not allow us to d"
https://openalex.org/W2010141757,"Abstract The Arabidopsis thaliana flavoprotein AtHAL3a is related to plant growth and salt and osmotic tolerance. AtHAL3a shows sequence homology to the bacterial flavoproteins EpiD and Dfp. EpiD, Dfp, and AtHAL3a are members of the homo-oligomeric flavin-containing Cys decarboxylase (HFCD) protein family. We demonstrate that AtHAL3a catalyzes the decarboxylation of (R)-4′-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine to 4′-phosphopantetheine. This key step in coenzyme A biosynthesis is catalyzed in bacteria by the Dfp proteins. Exchange of His-90 of AtHAL3a for Asn led to complete inactivation of the enzyme. Dfp and AtHAL3a are characterized by a shortened substrate binding clamp compared with EpiD. Exchange of the cysteine residue of the conserved ACGD motif of this binding clamp resulted in loss of (R)-4′-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase activity. Based on the crystal structures of EpiD H67N with bound substrate peptide and of AtHAL3a, we present a model for the binding of (R)-4′-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine to AtHAL3a."

Ets2 protein binding to a “weak” Ets-like site of the promoter is dependent on GR bound to the adjacent cryptic glucocorticoid response element. Coimmunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking experiments show physical interaction between GR and Ets2 proteins. Mutational analyses show synergistic effects of Ets2 and GR in dexamethasone-mediated activation of the cytochrome P-450c27 promoter. The DNA-binding domain of GR, lacking the transcription activation and ligand-binding domains, was fully active in synergistic activation of the promoter with intact Ets2. The DNA-binding domain of Ets2 lacking the transcription activation domain showed a dominant negative effect on the transcription activity. Finally, a fusion protein consisting of the GR DNA-binding domain and the transcription activation domain of Ets2 fully supported the transcription activity, suggesting a novel synergy between the two proteins, which does not require the transactivation domain of GR. Our results also provide new insights on the role of putative weak consensus Ets sites in transcription activation, possibly through synergistic interaction with other gene-specific transcription activators.

Cytochrome P-450c27 (CYP27)1 is a multifunctional enzyme with major activities for the c27 hydroxylation of cholesterol and c25 hydroxylation of vitamin D3 (1Su P. Rennert H. Shayiq R.M. Yamamoto R.

Cholesterol c27 hydroxylation in the liver mitochondria is a rate-limiting step in the acidic bile acid pathway and also in the feedback regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis (2Bjorkhem I. J.

Vitamin D3 25 hydroxylation in liver mitochondria, on the other hand, represents an important first step toward the conversion of inactive vitamin into the active hormonal form. Thus, the enzyme plays important roles in different pathways of cholesterol homeostasis, bile acid metabolism, and Ca2+ homeostasis (1Su P. Rennert H. Shayiq R.M. Yamamoto R. Zhwng Y.M. Addya S.

In the rat, the CYP27 gene is expressed as a major species of 2-kb mRNA and a minor species of 5′-extended 2.3-kb mRNA (5Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol.

Vlahcevic Z.R. Stravitz R.T. Mallonee D.H. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Hylemon P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have characterized the rat CYP27 gene structure and found that the transcription initiation site and the basal promoter elements required for transcription of the major 2-kb mRNA are localized within the 5′ end of the second exon (6Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated mechanisms of glucocorticoid-mediated transcription activation of the 2-kb mRNA and found that the essential elements needed for hormone-mediated activation are localized in the 5′-proximal, putative intron region, upstream of the 2-kb mRNA start site. Throughout this study, this downstream promoter will be referred to as the CYP27 promoter. GR is a steroid receptor family zinc finger protein that activates transcription of many liver-specific genes (9Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar). Binding of Dx, a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone, and related ligands to GR induces structural changes in the receptor resulting in the transcription activation of target genes (9Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar). Variant forms of GREs with different affinities for GR binding and hence various activation potentials have been reported (10Pearce D. Matsui W. Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30081-30085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). In most cases, the 15-nucleotide-long GRE consists of two half-sites, with consensus sequence (T/G)GTACAXXXTGTTCT (9Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar). One molecule of dimeric GR binds to each of the half-sites, TGTACA and TGTTCT, in a cooperative manner (12Tsai S.Y.

Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). GR also modulates transcription activity through receptor-receptor interaction between proteins bound to tandem GRE sites (15Strahle U. Schmid W. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3389-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 26Grange T. Roux J. Rigaud G. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8695-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently Zhang et al. (22Zhang Z. Jones S. Hagood J.S. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol.

This interaction was suggested to help synergize transcriptional effects of the interleukin-6 response element and GRE sites through Stat-3, which acts as a potent coactivator of GRE-mediated transcription. Some studies suggest that transcription activation by GR is also subject to regulation by Ets family transcription factors. Transient transfection studies showed that PU.1 and GR reciprocally modulate the activity of each factor, resulting in transcriptional repression (27Crepieux P. Coll J. Stehelin D. Crit. Rev. Oncol. 1994; 5: 615-638Google Scholar,28Gauthier J.M. Bourachot B. Doucas V. Yaniv M. Moreau-Gachelin F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5089-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms of repression, however, remain unclear. Another study showed that mutations targeted to the Ets1-binding site, overlapping the GR binding motif of the tyrosine aminotransferase promoter, resulted in a 2-fold reduction in transcription activity, suggesting synergistic effects of the two factors (29Espinas M.L. Roux J. Ghysdale J. Pictet R. Grange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4116-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the precise mode of physical interaction between the factors was not investigated. In the present study we show that Dx-mediated activation of CYP27 gene expression involves GR binding to a variant GRE site and its synergistic interaction with factors binding to an adjacent “weak” consensus Ets site, referred to in this study as an Ets-like site. Interestingly, the activation appears to require a novel functional and physical interaction between the DNA-binding domain of GR and the transcription activation domain of the ubiquitously expressed Ets2 transcription factor. The CYP27 promoter constructs were generated by PCR amplification of the −841/+23mCAT DNA from the rat CYP27 gene described before (6Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and cloned into the promoterless and enhancerless basic CAT plasmid pCATbasic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in the HindIII and SalI sites. The −329/+23mCAT was generated by digesting the −841/+23mCAT DNA withPstI (at position −329) and SalI (at position +23), and the fragment was cloned into the same sites of pCATbasic DNA. The 5′ progressive deletions −194/+23mCAT, −75/+23mCAT, and −45/+23mCAT were derived by digesting the SalI-digested −841/+23mCAT DNA with SacI (−194), XhoI (−76), or SmaI (−45) enzymes, respectively. All the fragments were gel purified, blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and recloned into pCATbasic plasmid at blunt ended SphI and SalI sites. Mutations at the cryptic GRE, Ets-like, Ap-1-like sites within the −329 to −194 promoter sequence were introduced by overlapping PCR using primers containing appropriate substitutions and further amplified using sense primer containing a HindIII site and antisense primer containing a SacI site for cloning. The mutant DNA fragments were cloned in the HindIII andSacI sites of pCATbasic vector. The nucleotide sequence of all the constructs was verified by the dideoxy chain termination sequencing (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). The rat GR expression cDNA (p6RGR) encoding the full-length receptor protein and the truncated rat GR DNA-binding domain (GRDBD, amino acids 407–556 of the GR protein) expression plasmid (p6R-X556) were kindly provided by Dr. K. Yamamoto (31Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Expression plasmid PSV2Ets2, encoding the full-length Ets2 protein, and a dominant negative mutant PSV2tEts2, expressing only the DNA-binding domain of Ets2 were described before (32Dudek H. Tantravathi R.V. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 2V. Rao, and E. S. Reddy, unpublished observations. CMVEts1encoding an intact murine Ets1 was obtained from Dr. Michael Atchison. A cDNA encoding the DNA-binding region of Ets1 (tEts1, amino acids 260–440 of murine Ets1) was generated by PCR amplification and cloned in the pCMV vector. A chimeric construct of the GRDBD and the transcription activation domain of Ets2 was generated by cloning the GRDBD cDNA (NdeI and SalI fragment, nucleotides 1206–1656 of 6GR cDNA) into similarly cut pGEM5z plasmid DNA. cDNA corresponding to the transcription activation domain of murine Ets2 (amino acid residues 40–280) was amplified using the sense primer containing a SmaI site and antisense primer containing a SalI site and cloned into similarly digested 5z GRDBD plasmid DNA to produce a contiguous open reading frame. The resulting cDNA expressed a 26-kDa fusion protein containing a DNA-binding domain of GR with a C-terminally fused (in frame) transcription activation domain of Ets2. Finally, the chimeric cDNA construct was cloned into the mammalian expression vector PCMV4 and was designated as pGRDBD-Ets2. This clone was used to generate deletion constructs pGRDBDΔZF-Ets2 (lacking amino acids 455–485 of GRDBD) and pGRDBD-Ets2Δ200 (lacking the N-terminal 200 residues of Ets2) by standard or overlap PCR. A cDNA encoding GRDBD and the N-terminal 40–280 amino acid residues of murine Ets1 fusion protein was generated using a similar approach. Mouse Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C. Murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells were maintained as described before (6Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected in replicate plates with CsCl2 gradient-purified CYP27 promoter plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method or in some cases using the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The latter procedure routinely yielded transcription efficiency of >60%. Cells (100-mm plates) were transfected with 5 μg of test plasmid DNAs and 1.5 μg of CMV β-gal expression cDNA, pCH110 (33Lenka N. Basu A. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30281-30289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For cotransfection experiments, 5 μg of the reporter plasmid was cotransfected with either 2 μg of rat GR cDNA, 0.8 μg of CMVEts1/Ets2 cDNAs, 1.5–3.0 μg of GRDBD-Ets2, GRDBDΔZF-Ets2, GRDBD-Ets2Δ200, and GRDBD-Ets1 chimeric cDNA constructs, or 1 μg of GRDBD cDNA construct. The total DNA in each transfection was normalized to 15 μg with CMV DNA as the filler. In some experiments the medium was changed with that containing 2% fetal bovine serum after 40 h of transfection, and cells were exposed to 100 nm Dx (Sigma) for 8–10 h before harvesting. Control cells not subjected to Dx induction were harvested after 48–50 h of transfection. Cell extracts were prepared by standard procedure and used for assaying CAT activity (33Lenka N. Basu A.

The β-galactosidase activity of each of the extracts was used as an internal control for normalizing the transfection efficiency (33Lenka N. Basu A. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30281-30289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract from NIH 3T3 cells were prepared by the method of Dignamet al. (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed purified GRDBD protein (apparent molecular mass of 17.0 kDa) was a generous gift from Dr. K. Yamamoto (35Freedman L.P. Luisi B.F. Korszun Z.R. Basavappa R. Sigler P.B. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Ets2 protein was overexpressed in BL21 cells by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction using the pET vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) and purified to near homogeneity by affinity binding to the nickel-agarose matrix (Qiagen Inc., Velenica, CA). RNA from transfected and mock-transfected Balb/c 3T3 cells was prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar). RNA (30 μg each) was resolved by electrophoresis through a formaldehyde-containing gel, transblotted to Nytran membranes, and hybridized with the 32P-labeled rat CYP27 cDNA or cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV cDNA probes under moderate stringency conditions. The blots were quantified using a Bio-Rad GS 525 Molecular Imager system. DNA-protein binding was assayed by gel mobility shift EMSA as described (37Singh H. Sen R. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Binding was carried out with a 32P end-labeled 135-bp DNA fragment from the glucocorticoid hormone-responsive region of the promoter (amino acids −329 to −194), which was generated by digesting pCAT-329/+23 DNA with PstI and SacI restriction enzymes. In some experiments, a shorter 65-bp DNA (amino acids −233 to −298) generated by PCR was used as a probe. Typically, binding reactions were run in 20-μl volumes and contained ∼0.1–0.2 ng of labeled DNA (10,000–15,000 cpm), 5–8 μg of nuclear extract, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) under conditions described previously (37Singh H. Sen R. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Binding reactions with the bacterially expressed purified GR derivative X556 (GRDBD protein) were performed in a similar way except that 100–800 ng of protein, diluted in a zinc-containing buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.6, 40 mm NaCl, 15 μmZnCl2), was used (38Lassar A.B.

DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE (1× TBE: 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). For competition studies, stated amounts of unlabeled competitor DNAs were preincubated with the assay mixture for 10 min, at 25 °C, prior to the addition of labeled probes. For antibody supershift assays, 1 μl of BuGR2 monoclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Neshanic Station, NJ) or preimmune IgG was added to the reaction and incubated with the protein for 10 min at room temperature before the addition of DNA probe. Varied amounts of bacterially expressed GRDBD protein (35Freedman L.P. Luisi B.F. Korszun Z.R. Basavappa R. Sigler P.B. Yamamoto K.R.

In some experiments nuclear extracts from cells transfected with various cDNAs were used for coimmunoprecipitation by the same procedure. The antibody-antigen complexes were dissociated at 56 °C for 1 h in nonreducing Laemmli's sample buffer (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar), and proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transblotted to Nytran membrane. The blot was successively probed with monoclonal antibody to GR (BUGR2) and polyclonal antibody to Ets2 by using the Pierce Super-glo chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and visualized with a Bio-Rad FluorS imager. The Ets2 antibody used in this study also cross-reacted with Ets1 protein. Various cDNAs cloned in pGEM 7zf vectors (Promega) were used as templates for generating 35S-labeled in vitro translation products in the tnt reticulocyte translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Adx cDNA was cloned in pCRTM II vector as described elsewhere (40Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled translation products, 20,000 cpm in the case of GRDBD and Adx proteins or 50,000 cpm in the case of Ets1 and Ets2 proteins, were used for protein cross-linking. Cross-linking was carried out in 50 μl of reaction mix containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 35S-labeled proteins. The mixture was preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C to facilitate protein-protein interaction, followed by the addition of cross-linking agents dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate] (DSP) orm-maleimidobenzyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (sulfo-MBS), both from Pierce, to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cross-linking was carried out at room temperature for 30 min, and the reaction was quenched by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final of 20 mm (in the case of DSP) or 100 mmGly containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (in the case of sulfo-MBS). Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked products was carried out essentially as described before (39Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B.V. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), except that the buffer system contained 1 mm Met. The immunoprecipitates were dissolved in 1× Laemmli's buffer (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar), without added β-mercaptoethanol (BME) in the case of DSP cross-linked products, by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The cross-linked products were resolved by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were scanned through a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager. It is known that Dx induces the rat hepatic CYP27 mRNA, specifically the shorter 2-kb species, by 15–20-fold of control animals (7Vlahcevic Z.R. Jairath S.K. Heuman D.M. Stravitz R.T. Hylemon P.B. Avadhani N.G. Pandak W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 33: G646-G652Google Scholar). In the present study, the putative hormone response region of the CYP27 promoter was mapped by progressive 5′ deletion of the −841/+23CAT promoter construct, which contains essential elements for the expression of 2-kb mRNA (6Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For this purpose we used NIH 3T3 cells, which efficiently supported the activity of the CYP27 promoter in our previous study (6Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows the CAT activity of cells transfected with the full-length and deletion constructs under different conditions. A physical map of the promoter indicating the location of sequence motifs with full or partial consensus for binding to various transcription factors has been shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1 A. The activity of the full-length −841/+23CAT promoter construct was induced by about 3-fold either by cotransfection with GR cDNA or addition of 100 nm Dx. A combination of these two treatments, however, induced the transcription activity by about 6.5-fold. The −329/+23 CAT construct yielded a similar pattern of induction by cotransfection with GR cDNA and addition of Dx. Deletion to amino acid −194, however, drastically reduced the promoter activity to a level lower than the activities of the −75/+23 and −45/+23 constructs. These results suggest the occurrence of a negative enhancer element within the −194 to −75 sequence region. The −75/+23 construct yielded less than half of the activity of the full-length promoter, whereas the −45/+23 construct yielded further reduced activity, which was previously shown to be the basal promoter activity (6Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Results also show that deletion to −194 and beyond completely abolished responsiveness to GR and Dx, suggesting that the GHR region is located between sequence −329 and −194. As shown before (6Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the activity of the full-length −841/+23 CAT construct was >70-fold of the pCAT basic plasmid DNA. Fig.1 B shows the nucleotide sequence of the putative GHR region (sequence −329 to −194), which includes a cryptic GRE (TGCTGT), two weak Ets sites (TGGAAG), an AP-1-like site, and an upstream Sp1-like site. The nature of proteins binding to the Dx response region was studied by EMSA using the 135-bp (sequence −194 to −329) or 65-bp (−233 to −298) DNA probes. As shown in Fig.2 A, the 135-bp DNA probe formed a major complex (complex B) and a minor slow migrating complex (complex A), both of which were competed by 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled cryptic GRE DNA (CYP27 GRE). Further, a 20-fold molar excess of Ets-like DNA motif from the 135-bp region of the promoter (TTGGAAGCC) and also a high affinity Ets DNA motif (TCGGAAGC) competed with complex A, with marginal effects on complex B. The AP-1-like motif, on the other hand, failed to compete with both complexes. Although not shown, the Sp1-like sequence from upstream of the Ets-like sequence also did not compete with either of the complexes. Furthermore, antibody to GR but not preimmune IgG caused a supershifted complex, suggesting that a GR-related protein indeed binds to the 135-bp DNA probe. For yet unknown reasons the preimmune IgG marginally affected the intensity of complex A. The possible GR protein binding to the cryptic GRE motif (CYP27 GRE) was further investigated by EMSA using bacterially expressed, purified Zn2+-loaded GRDBD protein. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the CYP27 GRE motif formed a complex with GRDBD protein, which was supershifted by GR-specific antibody but not by preimmune IgG. Furthermore, the complex with GRDBD was competed by an unlabeled 20-fold molar excess CYP27 GRE DNA (ACTGCTGTGC). These results show that the cryptic GRE sequence indeed binds to GR protein. To further characterize the protein in complex A that was competed by excess Ets DNA (Fig. 2 A), we tested the binding of bacterially expressed, purified Ets2 protein to the 135-bp DNA probe both in the presence and absence of added GRDBD protein. EMSA in Fig.2 C shows that Ets2 protein by itself did not bind to the DNA probe, whereas a combination of GRDBD and Ets2 proteins resulted in the formation of a slow migrating complex (complex a), in addition to the GRDBD-specific complex b."

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of SRF in SMCs, the two CArG box-containing elements in the arterial SMC-specific SM22α promoter, SME-1 and SME-4, were functionally and biochemically characterized. Mutations that abolish binding of SRF to the SM22α promoter totally abolish promoter activity in transgenic mice. Moreover, a multimerized copy of either SME-1 or SME-4 subcloned 5′ of the minimal SM22α promoter (base pairs −90 to +41) is necessary and sufficient to restrict transgene expression to arterial SMCs in transgenic mice. In contrast, a multimerized copy of the c-fos SRE is totally inactive in arterial SMCs and substitution of the c-fos SRE for the CArG motifs within the SM22α promoter inactivates the 441-base pair SM22α promoter in transgenic mice. Deletion analysis revealed that the SME-4 CArG box alone is insufficient to activate transcription in SMCs and additional 5′-flanking nucleotides are required. Nuclear protein binding assays revealed that SME-4 binds SRF, YY1, and four additional SMC nuclear proteins. Taken together, these data demonstrate that binding of SRF to specific CArG boxes is necessary, but not sufficient, to restrict transgene expression to SMCs in vivo.

A distinguishing feature of the SMC lineage is its capacity to proliferate and modulate its phenotype during postnatal development (4Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 183: 333-338Google Scholar, 5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Metcalfe J.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This presumably evolved to facilitate adaptive and reparative processes such as those that occur in response to arterial injury. However, the capacity of SMCs to modulate their phenotype has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and bronchial asthma (6Newby A.C. Zaltsman A.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 7Schwartz S.M. Murry C.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 437-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Ultimately, SMC phenotype is dependent upon the expression of genes encoding SMC-specific contractile proteins, cell surface receptors, and intracellular enzymes. In cardiac and skeletal myocytes, gene expression is regulated primarily at the level of transcription and skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific and -restricted transcription factors have been identified (8Olson E.N. Srivastaba D. Science. 1996; 272: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 9Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 10Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. Harvey R.P. Rosenthal N. Heart Development. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 291-303Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, relatively little is currently understood about the transcriptional programs that regulate SMC development and differentiation and SMC-specific transcription factors have not as yet been identified. Accumulating evidence suggests that the MADS box transcription factor SRF plays an important role in regulating SMC specification and differentiation (for review, see Ref. 3Parmacek M.S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 51: 69-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SRF is a 508-amino acid protein that binds to the serum response element (SRE), or CArG box, corresponding to the consensus nucleotide sequence CC(AT)6GG (11Treisman R. Nature. 1995; 376: 468-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Five alternatively spliced isoforms of SRF have been identified; at least one of which acts in a dominant negative fashion and represses SRF-dependent transcription (12Belaguli N.S. Zhou W. Trinh T.-H.T. Majesky M.W. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4582-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Kemp P.R. Metcalfe J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 445-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SRF binds DNA and physically associates with other transcription factors through its conserved MADS box domain (14Mueller C.G.F. Nordheim A.

Subsequently, functionally important CArG boxes have been identified in multiple SMC-restricted transcriptional regulatory elements including the SM22α promoter (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C.

Dyn. 1996; 207: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, SRF has been shown to play an important role in specification of SMCs from undifferentiated mesenchyme (28Landerholm T.E. Dong X.-R. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Majesky M.W. Development. 1999; 126: 1053-2062Google Scholar). Because of it SMC lineage-restricted pattern of expression, our group, and others, have utilized the murine SM22α promoter as a model system to examine the transcriptional programs that regulate SMC development and differentiation (21Kim S.

Heeley D.H. Smillie L.B. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Preliminary characterization of the SM22α promoter revealed six nuclear protein-binding sites, designated smooth muscle elements (SME) 1–6, respectively (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Two of thesecis-acting elements, SME-1 and SME-4, contain consensus CArG boxes and bind specifically to SRF (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, the SM22α promoter restricts expression of a transgene encodingLacZ to arterial smooth muscle cells, the myotomal component of the somites, and the bulbocordis region of the embryonic heart (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J.

However, in contrast to the endogenous SM22α protein, SM22α promoter-driven transgene expression is not observed in visceral or venous SMCs (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J.

In the studies described in this report, we show that SRF binding is required for activity of the SM22α promoter in arterial SMCs, but that SME-1 and SME-4 function in a partially redundant fashion in vivo. Most importantly, we demonstrate that a multimerized copy of SME-1 (bp −279 to −256) or SME-4 (bp −171 to −135) is necessary and sufficient to confer arterial SMC-restricted gene expression in transgenic mice, while a multimerized copy the c-fos SRE is not. Consistent with these data, substitution of the c-fosSRE (16Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) for the two CArG boxes in the SM22α promoter totally inactivates the SM22α promoter in transgenic mice. Deletion analyses revealed that the SME-4 CArG box and additional 5′-flanking nucleotides are required for transcriptional activity in arterial SMCs. Nuclear protein binding assays demonstrated that SME-4 binds six nuclear proteins, two of which are enriched in SMC nuclear extracts. Taken together, these data demonstrate that binding of SRF to specific CArG boxes is necessary, but not sufficient, to restrict gene expression to tissue-restricted subsets of SMCs. All transgenic vectors were prepared in the modified BluescriptII KS (Stratagene) plasmid containing the bacterialLacZ gene subcloned in the HindIII site of theAscI-flanked polylinker described previously (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The p-441SM22.LacZ transgenic vector in which LacZ is placed under the transcriptional control of the 441-bp mouse SM22α promoter was described previously (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C.

The pSM22.LacZ plasmid encodesLacZ under the transcriptional control of the 90-bp mouse SM22α promoter (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell.

Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To identify transgenic embryos, high molecular weight DNA was prepared from the yolk sacs of embryonic day (E)11.5 embryos and Southern blot analyses were performed as described previously (21Kim S.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Photography was performed using a Nikon SMZ-U dissecting microscope, Nikon 6006 camera, and Kodak EPT160 film. Primary rat aortic SMCs, A7r5 SMCs, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, HepG2 cells, HeLa cells, C2C12 myoblasts, and myotubes and EL4 T cells were grown in culture, harvested, and nuclear extracts prepared as described previously (21Kim S.

EMSAs were performed in 0.25 × TBE (1 × TBE is 100 mm Tris, 100 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) as described previously (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The following complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized with BamHI and BglII overhanging ends: SME-1 (5′-CAAGGAAGGGTTTCAGGGTCCTGCCCATAAAAGGTTTTTCCCGGCCGC-3′); SME-4 (5′-CTCCAACTTGGTGTCTTTCCCCAAATATGGAGCCTGTGTGGAGTG); c-fos(5′-CTTACACAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCTGCG). For cold competition experiments, 10 to 200 ng of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide were included in the binding reaction mixture. For antibody supershift experiments, 1 μl of rabbit preimmune affinity purified IgG (Santa Cruz), α-SRF rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz sc-335X), α-YY1 rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-281X), α-SAP1A rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz sc-1426X), α-Ets-1 rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz sc-350X), or α-Elk-1 rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz sc-355X) was incubated with the indicated nuclear extract at 4 °C for 20 min prior to the binding reaction as described previously (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). EMSA reactions performed with32P-labeled deoxybromouridine-substituted SME-4 oligonucleotide probes (bp −190 to −110) were scaled up four times as described (33Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 12.5.1-12.5.8Google Scholar). The binding reactions were exposed to UV light in an UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene Inc.) and treated with 4 μg of DNase I (Worthington) and 3 units of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington). DNA-bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiographically visualized. The arterial SMC-specific 441-bp SM22α promoter contains six nuclear protein-binding sites, two of which (SME-1 and SME-4) contain embedded CArG boxes that bind SRF (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To determine whether binding of SRF to the 441-bp SM22α promoter is required for transcriptional activity in SMCs, the transcriptional activity of the 441-bp SM22α promoter containing site-directed mutations in SME-1 and SME-4 that abolish SRF binding was assayed in F0 transgenic mice (Fig. 1,upper panel). Consistent with our previous report (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), in E11.5–441SM22.LacZ embryos, the 441-bp SM22α promoter restricted activity of the LacZ transgene to arterial SMCs, the bulbocordis region (BC) of the heart (future right ventricle), the cardiac outflow tract (OFT), and the myotomal component of the somites (S) (Fig. 1, A-C). LacZ-positive cells (blue-stained cells) were observed in presumptive SMCs underlying the endothelium of major arteries (Fig. 1 B). In addition, β-galactosidase activity was reproducibly observed in regions of the cardiac outflow tract including the aortopulmonary septum (Fig.1 C). In contrast, in 11 independent E11.5–441SM22μCArG.LacZ transgenic embryos, containing mutations in both SME-1 and SME-4 that abolish SRF binding to the SM22α promoter, β-galactosidase activity was not observed (Fig. 1 D). These data demonstrate that binding of SRF to the mouse SM22α promoter is required for transcriptional activity in all three embryonic muscle cell lineages. To determine whether SME-1 and SME-4 mediate distinct or redundant functions, site-directed mutations in SME-1 and SME-4 (Fig. 1,upper panel), respectively, were generated within the context of the intact 441-bp SM22α promoter and the transcriptional activity of these mutant promoters were assessed in F0transgenic mice. In four independent -441SM22 μSME-1.LacZ embryos, containing a mutation that abolishes binding of SRF and Sp1 to SME-1, blue staining was observed in arterial SMCs, the myotomal component of the somites (S), the cardiac OFT, and the BC region of the embryonic heart (Fig. 1 E). This pattern closely resembled that observed in the control -441SM22.LacZ embryos although the intensity of staining was somewhat diminished (compare Fig. 1,A and E). In contrast, in four independent -441SM22 μSME4.LacZ transgenic embryos, containing a promoter mutation that selectively abolishes binding of SRF to SME-4, β-galactosidase activity was observed in arterial SMCs and the cardiac outflow tract, but not within the myotomal component of the somites (Fig. 1 F). Of note, blue staining in the dorsal aorta was consistently less intense than that observed in -441SM22.LacZ and -441SM22.μSME1.LacZ transgenic embryos (compare Fig. 1,A and F). Taken together, these data demonstrate that mutations that abolish binding of SRF to SME-1 and SME-4, respectively, attenuate, but do not abolish, activity of the mouse SM22α promoter in arterial SMCs. In addition, mutation of SME-4 abolished transgene expression in the somites, while mutation of SME-1 did not. To determine whether SME-1 is necessary and sufficient to restrict transgene expression to arterial SMCs, SM22.SME-1.LacZ embryos were generated containing theLacZ reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the minimal SM22α promoter (bp −90 to +41) and three copies of SME-1 (bp −279 to −256). In three independent SM22.SME-1.LacZ embryos, dark blue staining indicative of β-galactosidase activity was observed within arterial SMCs, the myotomal component of the somites (S), the BC region of the primitive heart and cardiac OFT. This pattern recapitulated the pattern of β-galactosidase activity observed in control -441SM22.LacZ transgenic embryos, but the blue staining was consistently more intense (compare Figs.2 A and 1A). To determine whether SME-4 is necessary and sufficient to restrict transgene expression to arterial SMCs, SM22.SME-4.LacZ transgenic embryos were generated harboring the LacZ transgene under the transcriptional control of the minimal SM22α promoter linked to four copies of SME-4. In four independent SM22SME-4.LacZ transgenic embryos, pale blue staining was restricted to arterial SMCs (Fig.2 B). LacZ activity was not observed within the somites or bulbocordis region of the embryonic heart. In contrast, in three independent SM22SME-4.LacZ embryos, β-galactosidase activity was also observed within the myotomal component of the somites suggesting that the site of transgene integration into the host genome may alter the muscle-restricted pattern of transgene expression (Fig.3 A). Of note, inclusion of additional nucleotides flanking SME-1 (bp −292 to 250) and SME-4 (bp −190 to −110), respectively, did not alter the pattern of transgene expression observed (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that a multimerized copy of either SME-1 or SME-4 is necessary and sufficient to restrict transgene expression to arterial SMCs in F0 transgenic embryos. However, differences in the level of expressed transgene as well as differences in the muscle-restricted pattern of transgene expression were observed between SME-1 and SME-4 promoter-driven constructs.Figure 3The SME-4 CArG box alone is not sufficient to restrict gene expression to arterial SMCs in transgenic mice. Upper panel, the nucleotide sequence of SME-4 and SME-4 deletion mutants SME-4.CArG, SME-4.5′CArG, and SME-4.3′CArG are shown. Four copies of each oligonucleotide were subcloned immediately 5′ of the 90-bp SM22α promoter and the activities of each respective promoter were analyzed in F0 transgenic mice. A,three of seven SM22.SME4.LacZ embryos demonstrated LacZactivity in the dorsal aorta (Ao), the myotomal component of the somites (S), and the cardiac OFT. In four of seven SM22.SME4.LacZ embryos LacZ activity was restricted to arterial SMCs and the cardiac outflow tract (see Fig. 2 B).B, SM22.SME4.CArG.LacZ embryos did not express theLacZ transgene. C, SM22.SME4.5′CArG embryos demonstrated LacZ activity restricted to arterial SMCs, the myotomal component of the somites and the cardiac outflow tract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Functionally important CArG boxes have been identified in transcriptional regulatory elements controlling expression of growth-related genes, most notably c-fos (16Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To determine whether the c-fos SRE (Fig. 2, upper panel) could be substituted for the two CArG boxes in the SM22α promoter, -441SM22Δc-fos.LacZ transgenic mice were generated containing a transgene encoding LacZ under the transcriptional control of the 441-bp SM22α promoter in which the c-fos SRE has been substituted for the CArG boxes within SME-1 and SME-4, respectively. Surprisingly, in five independent -441SM22Δc-fos.LacZ embryos, β-galactosidase activity was not observed (data not shown). In theory, nucleotides flanking the c-fos SRE may also be required for activity of this element in arterial SMCs. To examine this possibility, SM22.c-fos.LacZ transgenic embryos were generated containing the LacZ reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the minimal SM22α promoter linked to three copies of thec-fos SRE and its flanking sequences including the TCF/Ets-binding site (Fig. 2, upper panel). Once again, β-galactosidase activity was not observed in five of six independent SM22.c-fos.LacZ embryos (Fig. 2 C). Of note, in one SM22.c-fos.LacZ embryo faint blue staining was observed at the caudal region at the base of the neck and in the limb buds (data not shown). These data demonstrate that binding of SRF to CArG box sequences alone is not sufficient to activate transcription in arterial SMCs and that nucleotides within and flanking specific CArG box motifs distinguish their respective activities in SMCs. To determine whether the SME-4 CArG box alone is necessary and sufficient to restrict transgene expression to arterial SMCs, SM22.SME4.CArG.LacZ transgenic mice were generated containing a transgene encoding LacZunder the transcriptional control of four copies of the SME-4 CArG box linked to the minimal SM22α promoter (Fig. 3, upper panel). Of note, this 10-bp sequence (CCAAATATGG) binds SRF in EMSAs (data not shown). However, in six independent SM22.SME4.CArG.LacZ embryos, β-galactosidase activity was not observed (Fig.3 B). Therefore, to determine whether 5′ or 3′ sequences flanking the SME-4 CArG box are required for transcriptional activity in arterial SMCs, transgenic mice were generated in which theLacZ gene was placed under the transcriptional control of the minimal SM22α promoter linked to four copies of SME-4 deletion mutants (Fig. 3, upper panel). In two independent E11.5 SM22.SME4.5′CArG.LacZ embryos, containing four copies of the SME-4 CArG box and its 5′-flanking sequences (bp −171 to −142), β-galactosidase activity was observed in a pattern recapitulating that observed in the SM22.SME4.LacZ embryos (compare Fig. 3,A and C). In contrast, LacZ activity was not observed in four independent SM22.SME4.3′CArG.LacZ embryos, containing 4 copies of the SME-4 CArG box and its 3′-flanking sequence (bp −151 to −136) (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the SME-4 CArG box sequence alone is not sufficient to restrict gene expression to arterial SMCs in transgenic embryos and that additional 5′-flanking sequence in SME-4 (bp −171 to −152) is required to activate transcription in arterial SMCs. To determine whether SME-4 and c-fos SRE differentially bind nuclear protein complexes expressed in SMCs, a series of EMSAs was performed. SME-4 binds four specific nuclear protein complexes, designated A-D, each of which is competed by unlabeled SME-4 competitor oligonucleotide (Fig.4 A, lanes 3–5). Of note, several nonspecific binding activities were also observed that were not cross-competed with high concentrations of unlabeled SME-4 oligonucleotide. In addition, complexes A-D were efficiently competed by increasing concentrations of unlabeled c-fos SRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 A, lanes"

However, the molecular mechanism(s) of their interaction with cognate nucleic acids are not well understood, partly due to the lack of structural information. In this work, a protein dissection approach was used to gain information on the structural and RNA-binding properties of this class of proteins, as exemplified by the 61-amino acid residue p7 MP from carnation mottle virus (CarMV). Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that CarMV p7 is an α/β RNA-binding soluble protein. Using synthetic peptides derived from the p7 sequence, we have identified three distinct putative domains within the protein. EMSA showed that the central region, from residue 17 to 35 (represented by peptide p717–35), is responsible for the RNA binding properties of CarMV p7. This binding peptide populates a nascent α-helix in water solution that is further stabilized in the presence of either secondary structure inducers, such as trifluoroethanol and monomeric SDS, or RNA (which also changes its conformation upon binding to the peptide). Thus, the RNA recognition appears to occur via an “adaptive binding” mechanism. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence and structural properties of the RNA-binding domain of p7 seem to be conserved among carmoviruses and some other RNA-binding proteins and peptides. The low conserved N terminus of p7 (peptide p71–16) is unstructured in solution. In contrast, the highly conserved C terminus motif (peptide p740–61) adopts a β-sheet conformation in aqueous solution. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the RNA-binding motif showed how selected positive charged amino acids are more relevant than others in the RNA binding process and how hydrophobic amino acid side chains would participate in the stabilization of the protein-RNA complex.AJ304989 Plant viral movement proteins (MPs) participate actively in the intra- and intercellular movement of RNA plant viruses to such an extent that MP dysfunction impairs viral infection.

Kluwer, Boston1999: 161-182Crossref Google Scholar). MPs participate actively in the intra- and intercellular movement of plant viruses, and mutant virus analyses, reverse genetics, and plant transformation have demonstrated that MP dysfunction impairs viral infection (3Meshi T.

The 30-kDa TMV MP binds single-stranded (viral) RNA in vitro with no sequence specificity and high cooperativity (5Citovsky V. Knorr D. Schuster G. Zambryski P.

Science. 1987; 237: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Sequence deletion and mutagenesis studies have located some of these functions in separate motifs/domains of the protein (11Berna A. Gafny R. Wolf S. Lucas W.J. Holt C.A. Beachy R.N. Virology. 1991; 182: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Kahn T.W. Lapidot M. Heinlein M. Reichel C. Cooper B. Gafny R. Beachy R.N.

TMV MP names the “30K” superfamily of virus MPs that comprise proteins from 18–20 groups of viruses (14Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Ryabov E.V. Dolja V.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Melcher U. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) including viruses that move as tobamoviruses but also tubule-forming viruses (1Carrington J.C. Kasschau K.D. Mahajan S.K. Schaad M.C. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1669-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). RNA (or DNA) binding properties are known for an increasing number of MPs that belong to taxonomically very diverse viruses, both within and outside those included in the 30K superfamily. MPs appear, therefore, as a separate and functionally important group of proteins capable of binding RNA and which are critical for plant infestation. Strikingly, recent data suggest that viral MPs mimic plant proteins involved in an RNA-based long distance signaling system that would operate through plant vascular tissue (16Jorgensen R.A. Atkinson R.G. Forster R.L. Lucas W.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1486-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Antigenic cross-reaction (17Xoconostle-Cazares B. Xiang Y. Ruiz-Medrano R. Wang H.L. Monzer J. Yoo B.C. McFarland K.C. Franceschi V.R. Lucas W.J. Science. 1999; 283: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and sequence homology searches (15Melcher U. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) have identified MP-like candidates among plant phloem sap proteins. Progress has been made in the structural characterization of sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins and peptides and of their interaction with cognate RNAs (18Antson A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, knowledge lags behind in the structural analyses of sequence-nonspecific RNA-binding proteins. Recently, TMV MP was shown to fold as an α-helical membrane protein in the presence of urea and SDS (20Brill L.M. Nunn R.S. Kahn T.W. Yeager M. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7112-7117Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and a topological model for its insertion into the cell membrane was proposed. Despite their hallmark functions, detailed experimental data on the structure of MPs is lacking, and the mechanisms of RNA recognition and structural parameters involved in the interaction with viral nucleic acids are far from being understood. An open question remains, for instance, as to the mechanism(s) that allow MPs (and plant MP-like proteins) to recognize and transport specific RNAs despite their demonstrated nonspecific in vitro RNA binding (21Jackson D. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2000; 3: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, the study of proteins having membrane-spanning domains as MPs is hampered by the problems encountered in purification and/or solubilization in native conformation. An alternative approach would be to identify simplified polypeptide models of MP function, capable of insertion into biological membranes and/or RNA binding as water-soluble domains. Such models have not been found so far for viral MPs. Alternatively, nature can be searched for examples in which MP functions map in separate proteins. There are viruses that encode multiple MPs, which, in addition, do not fall in the 30K superfamily. The triple gene block of potexviruses encodes three proteins (open reading frames 2–4) that mediate cell-to-cell transport, the first one with RNA-binding and NTPase/helicase activities and the other two with putative membrane-spanning domains and, in the case of the third, demonstrated cell wall localization (22Hefferon K.L. Doyle S. AbouHaidar M.G. Arch. Virol. 1997; 142: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Rouleau M. Smith R.J. Bancroft J.B. Mackie G.A. Virology. 1994; 204: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Carmoviruses are among the smallest known plant viruses; their genome is a single-stranded RNA of ∼4 kilobases encoding at least five proteins (24Qu F. Morris T.J. Granoff A. Webster R.G. Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1999: 243-247Crossref Google Scholar, 25Russo M. Burgyan J. Martelli G. Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 44: 381-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Carmoviruses also code for separate MPs, and the two corresponding genes have been considered as a “truncated triple block” (26Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Arch. Virol. 1993; 133: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The type member of the group, carnation mottle virus (CarMV), encodes two very small overlapping polypeptides, p7 and p9, whose homologs in turnip crinkle virus have been shown to be involved in intercellular movement (27Li W.Z. Qu F. Morris T.J. Virology. 1998; 244: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Hacker D.L. Petty I.T. Wei N. Morris T.J. Virology. 1992; 186: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have previously confirmed that CarMV p7 has RNA binding properties in vitro and demonstrated that a 19-amino acid peptide derived from p7 was likewise capable of binding to RNA (29Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Pérez-Payá E. Pallás V. Virology. 1999; 255: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the other hand, sequence analyses on CarMV p9 suggest the presence of two membrane-spanning domains. It was proposed that their small size made carmovirus MPs a suitable model for the structural characterization of MP and their interaction with viral RNA. In the present study, we conducted a structural characterization of CarMV p7, and we used a retrostructural approach with the analysis of three separate individual peptides that cover most of the p7 sequence. We mapped the RNA-binding domain of the protein and showed its folding into a partial α-helix upon interaction with RNA. Finally, a series of amino acid residue substitutions were conducted on this domain in order to establish structure/RNA binding function relationships for this important class of proteins. Fmoc-protected amino acids for peptide synthesis were from SENN Chemicals (Gentilly, France). RNA in vitrotranscription kit was from Promega, and the digoxigenin detection kit was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Deuterium oxide (2H2O) and trifluoroethanol (TFE)-d3 was from Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories (Cambridge, United Kingdom). All other chemicals were from standard suppliers. p7 movement protein was produced and purified as in Ref. 29Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Pérez-Payá E. Pallás V. Virology. 1999; 255: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. Further purification was achieved by semipreparative RP-HPLC in a C-18 Lichrosphere analytical column (Waters, Barcelona, Spain). Fractions containing p7 protein were freeze-dried. A refolding protocol was carried out with the protein powder. First, the protein was solved at 1 mg/ml in buffer A (8 m guanidinium-HCl, 10% sucrose, 50 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01 mNaOH, pH 5.5). The solution was dialyzed overnight against buffer B (8m urea, 10% sucrose, 50 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01 m NaOH, pH 5.5). Successive dialyses were carried out against decreasing concentrations of urea (4, 2, and 0 m) in the same buffer B. Finally, the protein was dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5. This p7 protein solution was used in CD experiments as described below. Peptides were manually synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc chemistry (30Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar) as in Ref. 29Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Pérez-Payá E. Pallás V.

Analytical RP-HPLC and laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to determine the purity and identity of the peptides. All measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-810 CD spectropolarimeter, in conjunction with a Neslab RTE 110 water bath and temperature controller. CD spectra were the average of a series of 10 scans made at 0.2-nm intervals. CD spectra of the same buffer (or in the presence of TFE or SDS as described in the figure legends) without peptide were used as base line in all of the experiments. For p7 and peptides containing a tryptophan amino acid residue, the concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm using εTrp = 5570m−1 cm−1. The concentration of all of the other peptides was obtained by quantitative amino acid analysis. The CD spectra of the p717–35-RNA complex were recorded at 5 °C with 20 μm of p717–35, and increasing concentrations of CarMV ssRNA transcribed in vitro from clone pCarM.D5 (Ref. 29Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Pérez-Payá E. Pallás V.

The difference spectrum was the RNA-peptide complex minus the free RNA spectrum. Spectra were recorded in the far UV region in 5 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0, buffer. In peptide tritation experiments, increasing concentrations of p717–35 were added (from 0 to 200 μm) to a 1 mm RNA solution and left on ice for 30 min before the CD spectrum was recorded in the near UV region (250–350 nm). Different amounts of either p7 or the synthetic peptides were incubated with 1 ng of pCarM.D5 ssRNA probe (29Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Pérez-Payá E. Pallás V. Virology. 1999; 255: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), in a 10-μl final volume of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 units of HRPI RNase inhibitor (Promega) and 10% glycerol) for 30 min on ice. After incubation, 2 μl of loading buffer was added, and the samples were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose in TAE buffer (40 mmTris-acetate, 2 mm EDTA) at 50 V for 1 h at 4 °C. RNAs were transferred to positively charged nylon membranes by capillary elution in 20× SSC and fixed to the membranes by UV irradiation on a UV gene linker for 2 min. Membranes were hybridized to a digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe overnight at 60 °C in PSE (7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2). Detection of digoxigenin-labeled nucleic acids was conducted as described previously (29Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Pérez-Payá E. Pallás V. Virology. 1999; 255: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Pallás V. Mas P. Sanchez-Navarro J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 81: 461-468PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of free RNA probe in each sample was quantified by densitometry of the films (Quantity One software, Bio-Rad). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. Samples were prepared at 2.6 mm peptide concentration in two solvents: pure water and TFE/water (1:1, v/v). The spectra were acquired at 283 K. Water signal suppression was achieved using the WATERGATE sequence (32Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3507) Google Scholar). Phase-sensitive double quantum filtered COSY (33Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem.

Soc. 1979; 101: 4481-4484Crossref Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) experiments were performed to assign αC chemical shifts. TOCSY and ROESY spectra were recorded using the MLEV-17 spin-lock sequence. Mixing times for TOCSY spectra were 15 and 80 ms. Mixing times for ROESY experiments were 250 and 300 ms. The number of scans varied between 32 and 64, the number oft1 increments varied between 512 and 1024, and the number of points in the t2 dimension was 2048. 1H resonances were assigned using standard procedures (38Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). In our previous study, the p7 movement protein from a Spanish isolate of CarMV was sequenced and produced in bacteria, and its in vitro RNA binding properties were demonstrated (29Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Pérez-Payá E. Pallás V. Virology. 1999; 255: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the previously described RNA-binding peptide (29Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Pérez-Payá E. Pallás V. Virology. 1999; 255: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) corresponds to the binding domain of p7, this peptide (p717–35) and two additional peptides (p71–16 and p740–61) derived from the primary sequence of p7 (Fig.1 A) were synthesized and assayed for RNA binding. Fig. 1 B shows the EMSAs for the three peptides. As the concentration of p717–35 was increased, the amount of free viral RNA decreased concomitant with the appearance of a low electrophoretic mobility band that corresponds to an RNA-p717–35 complex. Our data demonstrated that the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid sequences of the p7 protein did not bind to RNA as shown by the lack of RNA-peptide complex formation. Therefore, we have unambiguously located the p7 domain responsible for the RNA binding in the amino acid motif covered by peptide p717–35. The secondary structures of CarMV p7 and the three synthetic peptides were analyzed by means of CD spectroscopy. Recombinant viral MPs typically form insoluble inclusion bodies that facilitate purification procedures (5Citovsky V. Knorr D. Schuster G. Zambryski P. Cell. 1990; 60: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 39Giesman-Cookmeyer D. Lommel S.A. The Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, protein recovered from solubilized inclusions must be refolded to native conformation before biophysical characterization. We have developed a procedure for refolding of His-tagged CarMV p7 purified from bacteria that provided soluble and functional protein capable of RNA binding (see “Experimental Procedures”). The far UV CD spectrum of purified and refolded CarMV p7 (Fig. 2 A) changed as compared with nonrefolded protein (data not shown), and it was evaluated for secondary structure content showing 43% unordered structure, 5% turns, and 10 and 42% α-helical and β-sheet structure, respectively. The spectra for the synthetic peptides derived from the p7 protein displayed remarkably distinct shapes. p71–16 and p717–35 showed an apparent unordered structure (Fig. 2,B and C), while p740–61 showed a CD spectrum typical for a β-sheet structure (Fig. 2 D). In order to assay the propensity of each peptide to be induced into a defined secondary structure, their CD spectra were also recorded in the presence of TFE, a solvent know to induce helicity in single-stranded potentially α-helical polypeptides (40Pérez-Payá E. Houghten R.A. Blondelle S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1048-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or submicellar concentrations of SDS, which is considered a template that would stabilize both α-helical or β-sheet conformations depending on the intrinsic propensity of the polypeptide sequence to adopt a preferred secondary structure (41Blondelle S.E. Ostresh J.M. Houghten R.A. Pérez-Payá E. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 351-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In 50% TFE, p71–16 and p717–35 peptides were induced into an α-helix with different mean residue ellipticities (Fig. 2, B andC). In the presence of 1 mm SDS, however, p71–16 was unordered (Fig. 2 B), while p717–35 was again induced into an α-helix (Fig.2 C). In contrast, the CD spectra obtained in buffer for p740–61 was not significantly modified by the presence of either 50% of TFE (Fig. 2 D) or SDS (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that the central region of p7, as represented by p717–35, is an inducible α-helix that is responsible of the RNA binding of p7 to ssRNA, while its C-terminal region (p740–61, which represents 31% of the amino acid sequence of p7) folds into a highly stable β-sheet that would account for the overall β-sheet content of p7. CD spectroscopy has been previously used to report structural changes in peptides that bind to RNA (42Tan R. Frankel A.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10288-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 43Tan R. Frankel A.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14579-14585Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The CD difference spectrum resulting from p717–35 peptide-viral RNA complex formation (RNA-peptide complex minus free RNA) showed significant changes in the far-UV region as compared with that of the free peptide (Fig. 3 A). Upon binding to CarMV RNA, the peptide p717–35 showed a conformational change characterized by a decrease in the random contribution at 200 nm and an increase in ellipticity at 220 nm (Fig.3 A). These changes in the CD spectrum are consistent with an increase in helical content in the secondary structure of the peptide. In addition, the RNA was constrained due to the formation of the complex. The CD spectrum in the absence of peptide showed a positive band with a maximum intensity at 270 nm characteristic of ssRNA; however, as the concentration of p717–35 was increased, a decrease in the CD signal and a red shift was observed (Fig.3 B). This type of change has been attributed to an unstacking of RNA bases as a consequence of peptide binding (44Tan R. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These results imply that not only did the peptide change its conformation upon binding to RNA but also the RNA adapted its conformation to allow the stabilization of the RNA-peptide complex. The CD secondary structure characterization of p7 and p717–35, together with the RNA binding experiments, allowed us to define the peptide p717–35 as an α-helical inducible protein motif. There are many examples in the literature of RNA-binding peptides and/or protein domains that fold in an α-helix upon binding (45Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11653Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and even some within plant virus coat proteins (46Van der Graaf M. Scheek R.M. Van der Linden C.C. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9177-9182Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but this is the first example on a MP. Moreover, the secondary structure prediction using AGADIR (47Munoz V. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) suggested that the segment with the highest tendency to adopt an α-helical structure in p7 is24TRRSVAKDAIRK35 (data not shown). In order to confirm this putative α-helix, we carried out NMR analysis of the peptide p717–35. The NMR spectra for p717–35was recorded in aqueous solution and in 50% TFE. Sequential assignments were obtained from the “fingerprint” region of the two-dimensional TOCSY, ROESY, and NOESY spectra. The adoption of a defined preferential secondary structure by a peptide induces significant and specific chemical shift changes in both 1H and 13C nuclei that can be used to quantify secondary structure populations. In particular, an α-helical conformation is characterized by upfield and downfield shifts of the αH and αC nuclei, respectively. Therefore, one can then measure, for each residue, the deviation of the experimental chemical shifts from those attributed to random coil conformations (38Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The polypeptide region that comprises the seven C-terminal amino acids in p717–35, from Ala-29 to Lys-35, appeared to populate a nascent α-helical conformation in water solution that is further stabilized in the presence of 50% TFE as defined by the analysis of the conformational chemical shifts of1Hα and 13Cα (Fig.4; a schematic of the helix is shown in Fig.5 D). Although cross-peak superposition between sequential and medium range NOEs precluded a more detailed identification, a set of medium range NOEs typical of α-helix were found in water solution (dαN i, i + 3 between Ser-27 and Lys-30 and between Asp-31 and Arg-34;dαN i, i + 4 between Asp-31 and Lys-35, data not shown) corresponding with strings of dNN NOEs. Furthermore, additionaldαN NOEs were identified in 50% TFE solution (i, i + 3 between Lys-30 and Ile-33 and between Ala-32 and Lys-35; i, i + 4 between Ala-29 and Lys-35 and between Lys-30 and Arg-34, data not shown).Figure 5A, sequence alignment of CarMV-dix p7 RNA-binding domain (this work; accession number AJ304989) and the homologous region of the other eight carmoviruses sequenced so far.CCFV, cardamine chlorotic fleck virus (accession numberL16015); CPMoV, cowpea mottle virus (U20976);MNSV, melon necrotic spot virus (M29671); SgCV, saguaro cactus virus (U72332); TCV, turnip crinkle virus (M22445); GaMV, galinsoga mosaic virus (Y13463);HCRSV, hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (X86448);JINRV, Japanese iris necrotic ring virus (D86123).

Inactivation of PGHS peroxidase activity has been found to begin with Intermediate II, which contains a tyrosyl radical. The structure of this radical is altered by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as indomethacin and flurbiprofen, and by replacement of heme by manganese protoporphyrin IX (forming MnPGHS-1). Peroxidase self-inactivation in inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 and MnPGHS-1 was characterized by stopped-flow spectroscopic techniques and by chromatographic and mass spectrometric analysis of the metalloporphyrin. The rate of peroxidase inactivation was about 0.3 s−1 in inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 and much slower in MnPGHS-1 (0.05 s−1); as with PGHS-1 itself, the peroxidase inactivation rates were independent of peroxide concentration and structure, consistent with an inactivation process beginning with Intermediate II. The changes in metalloporphyrin absorbance spectra during inactivation of inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 were similar to those observed with PGHS-1 but were rather distinct in MnPGHS-1; the kinetics of the spectral transition from Intermediate II to the next species were comparable to the inactivation kinetics in each case. In contrast to the situation with PGHS-1 itself, significant amounts of heme degradation occurred during inactivation of inhibitor-treated PGHS-1, producing iron chlorin and heme-protein adduct species. Structural perturbations at the peroxidase site (MnPGHS-1) or at the cyclooxygenase site (inhibitor-treated PGHS-1) thus can influence markedly the kinetics and the chemistry of PGHS-1 peroxidase inactivation.

PGHS undergoes irreversible self-inactivation during catalysis, thus limiting the overall number of turnovers (2Smith W.L. Lands W.E.M.

A recent mechanistic study of PGHS-1 peroxidase self-inactivation yielded two important findings: (a) the inactivation rate is independent of both peroxide and enzyme concentrations; and (b) a new spectral intermediate, Intermediate III, accumulates during the self-inactivation process after formation of Intermediate II and before the appearance of a terminal complex (7Wu G. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Osawa Y. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9231-9237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Peroxidase inactivation thus does not occur by decomposition of Intermediate I (or Compound I), which contains a porphyrin radical. Instead, the branch point between peroxidase catalysis and irreversible self-inactivation is probably at Intermediate II, which contains a tyrosyl radical (8Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,9Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Factors that change the structure of Intermediate II might thus be expected to modify the self-inactivation mechanism. Pretreatment of PGHS-1 with cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as indomethacin, flurbiprofen, or aspirin, is known to alter the tyrosyl radical structure in Intermediate II (10Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Tsai A.-L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 833-837PubMed Google Scholar), and the altered radical fails to oxidize arachidonic acid to initiate cyclooxygenase activity (12Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Xiao G. Swinney D.C. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3888-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A second approach to altering Intermediate II structure involves replacement of heme by mangano protoporphyrin IX (forming MnPGHS-1). The steady-state peroxidase activity of MnPGHS-1 is only ∼4% that of the iron enzyme because of very slow formation of Intermediate I (14Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8885-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but essentially full cyclooxygenase activity is preserved (15Odenwaller R. Maddipati K.R. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13863-13869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Strieder S. Schaible K. Scherer H.-J. Dietz R. Ruf H.H. J. Biol.

The peroxide-induced radical species in MnPGHS-1 displays EPR characteristics that are different from those of the iron enzyme, but the radical remains capable of oxidizing arachidonate to initiate the cyclooxygenase cycle (13Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Xiao G. Swinney D.C. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3888-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PGHS-1 treated with cyclooxygenase inhibitors and MnPGHS-1 thus provide useful systems to examine the relationship between reactive enzyme intermediates and peroxidase self-inactivation. We have evaluated the peroxidase self-inactivation kinetics in MnPGHS-1 and in PGHS-1 pretreated with indomethacin or flurbiprofen. The inactivation mechanisms were similar to that of native PGHS-1, although key intermediates showed different heme structures, and the overall rates were much slower for MnPGHS-1. Thus, modification of the Intermediate II structure has a strong influence on the self-inactivation process in PGHS-1. Hemin and MnPPIX were obtained from Porphyrin Products, Inc. (Logan, UT). Tween 20 and Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine were from Pierce. Guaiacol, hydrogen peroxide, and indomethacin were from Sigma. Flurbiprofen was from Upjohn Company (Kalamazoo, MI). Arachidonic acid was from Nuchek Preps (Elysian, MN). Peracetic acid and 3-chloroperbenzoic acid were from Aldrich; EtOOH was from Polysciences Inc. (Warrington, PA), and PPHP was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). 15-HPETE was prepared according to Graff et al. (18Graff G. Anderson L.A. Jaques L.W. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and was purified by HPLC using a Dynamax Microsorb silicic acid column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm). The other peroxides were quantified calorimetrically using excess PGHS-1 andN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine but were not further purified. X-Omat film was from Kodak (Rochester, NY). PGHS-1 apoenzyme was isolated from ram seminal vesicles as described previously (19Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Benedetto C. McDonald-Gibson R.G. Nigam S. Slater T.F. Prostaglandins and Related Substances: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 209-227Google Scholar). Holoenzyme was obtained by reconstitution of PGHS-1 apoenzyme with heme and subsequent removal of unbound heme by DEAE-cellulose (19Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Benedetto C. McDonald-Gibson R.G. Nigam S. Slater T.F. Prostaglandins and Related Substances: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 209-227Google Scholar). The concentration of PGHS-1 was determined by absorbance at 410 nm (Am = 165 mm−1cm−1). MnPGHS-1 was prepared by adding equimolar Mn-PPIX to PGHS-1 apoenzyme and incubating for 30 min at room temperature. Inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 was prepared by incubating PGHS-1 with 1–1.5 eq of either indomethacin or flurbiprofen (in ethanol) for 1–2 h on ice; the final ethanol concentration was less than 1%. The residual cyclooxygenase activity in inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 was usually around 4% of the control value. Peroxidase inactivation kinetics for MnPGHS-1 and inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 were determined at 24 °C using a sequential mixing protocol on a Bio-Sequential DX-18MV stopped-flow instrument (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, U. K.) as described previously (7Wu G. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Osawa Y. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9231-9237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). EtOOH or PPHP was used as the peroxidase substrate in the first stage for inhibitor-treated PGHS-1. 15-HPETE or PPHP was used as the substrate in the first-stage for MnPGHS-1 because of the low reaction rate with EtOOH (14Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8885-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The buffer used for these reactions was 0.1m KPi, pH 7.2, with 10% glycerol and 0.1% Tween 20. The assay mixture in the second stage was 10 mmguaiacol, 10 mm H2O2 for inhibitor-treated enzyme, and 10 mm guaiacol, 5 mm peracetic acid for MnPGHS-1. Peracetic acid was substituted for H2O2 because the former gave a workable peroxidase rate for MnPGHS-1. Peracetic acid was used only in the second stage to measure surviving peroxidase activity; the effects of contaminants in the peracetic acid thus should be constant regardless of the first-stage reaction time. Heme spectral changes were followed using the DX-18MV stopped-flow instrument with either photodiode array detection or with the kinetic scan utility. Reconstructed spectra were analyzed by singular value decomposition to remove background noise signals and simplify the data matrices (20Henry E.R. Hotrichter J.

A linear, three-species, two-step model (A → B → C) was the basic mechanistic scheme used to deconvolute the spectra of intermediate species (7Wu G. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Osawa Y. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9231-9237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fitting to alternative models, involving four species and three steps (A → B → C → D) or two species and one step (A → B), was used to check the suitability of the two-step model. The kinetic scan spectra and deconvoluted spectra for reactions with MnPGHS-1 were smoothed using a fast Fourier transform /reverse fast Fourier transform treatment (14Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8885-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Covalent changes in heme or MnPPIX during peroxide-induced PGHS self-inactivation were examined by HPLC analysis of rapid quench samples (7Wu G. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Osawa Y. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9231-9237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 or MnPGHS-1 was reacted with the desired peroxide for a defined period at 24 °C and then quenched by mixing with a 60% acetonitrile, 1.2% TFA solution using an Update Instrument (Madison, WI) System 1000 chemical/freeze quench apparatus. HPLC analysis was performed using a Waters model 600S controller, a model 717 Plus autosampler, and a model 996 photodiode array detector (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Samples were injected onto a Vydac C4 column (5 μm; 0.21 × 15 cm) equilibrated with solvent A (0.1% TFA) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Beginning at 2 min, a linear gradient was run to 75% solvent B (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile) over 30 min, and then another linear gradient was run to 100% solvent B over the next 3 min. Electrospray ionization LC-MS was accomplished using a Thermoquest LCQ/LC-MS system (Finnigan, San Jose, CA), connected to a Hewlett Packard series 1100 degasser, binary pump, and autosampler (Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE). Chromatographic conditions were optimized for heme using myoglobin as a standard. The sheath gas and the auxiliary gas were set at 90 and 30 (arbitrary units), respectively. The spray voltage was 4.2 kV, and the capillary temperature was 200 °C. Samples were purified by HPLC described above, except that the column was equilibrated with 25% solvent B at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. After 15 min, linear vamp to 75 and then to 100% solvent B were run over 20 and 5 min, respectively. The effluent was infused directly into the mass spectrometer. Standard iron chlorin eluted at 16 min followed by heme at 24.7 min. Luminescent detection of covalently bound heme was conducted using a published procedure (21Vuletich J.L. Osawa Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Quenched PGHS-1 samples (20 μl) were added to 20 μl of a mixture containing 5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 100 mmTris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Bands separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm; Bio-Rad). A chemiluminescence reagent (Super Signal, Pierce) was used as described by the manufacturer to detect the peroxidase activity of metalloporphyrin irreversibly bound to the protein. Films (X-Omat) were exposed for 40 min. PGHS-1 pretreated with indomethacin or flurbiprofen was first reacted with hydroperoxide for different lengths of time, and the surviving peroxidase activity was quantified by reaction with excess guaiacol and H2O2, using the sequential mixing protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” The surviving peroxidase activity was found to decline with single-exponential kinetics at all initial PPHP and EtOOH levels (data not shown). The observed first-order rate constants for decay of peroxidase activity are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of initial peroxide concentration. The inactivation rates for indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 varied between 0.13 and 0.29 s−1 with an average value of 0.19 ± 0.06 s−1(Fig. 1, A and B). Similar results were obtained for flurbiprofen-treated PGHS-1, but with a larger range, from 0.25 to 0.71 s−1; the average was 0.37 ± 0.14 s−1 (Fig. 1, C and D). The data in Fig. 1 make it clear that the rate of peroxidase inactivation in both inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 preparations was essentially independent of peroxide concentration with either EtOOH or PPHP. Varying the enzyme concentration from 0.1 to 2.4 μmalso led to little change in the inactivation rate. In the case of flurbiprofen-treated PGHS-1 reacted with EtOOH, there was a trend toward higher decay rates with increased peroxide concentration for 0.36 and 0.9 μm PGHS-1, but this trend is unlikely to be significant because it was not observed at either higher or lower enzyme concentrations (Fig. 1 D). The Soret region spectra acquired by photodiode array detector during the reaction of indomethacin- and flurbiprofen-treated PGHS-1 with EtOOH were similar to those observed for native PGHS-1 (Fig. 2). Data from the first 100 ms reflect primarily the transient formation of Intermediate I and its subsequent conversion to Intermediate II. These spectral changes had rate constants of at least 200 s−1, much faster than the observed inactivation kinetics (Fig. 1). To simplify analysis of spectral changes during peroxidase inactivation, attention was focused on spectral changes after 100 ms. Reconstructed spectra for the 0.1–1-s time range showed an isosbestic point at 403–404 nm and thus appeared to reflect a single transition between two species (Fig. 2. spectrab and c). Spectra obtained over the later 1–50-s period showed a simple decline in amplitude with little shift in wavelength (Fig. 2, spectrum d). Data between 0.1 and 50 s were found to fit better to a linear three-species, two-step model than to models with more or fewer steps (not shown), and so rate constants for a two-step mechanism were evaluated. The rate constant for the first step was 0.50 s−1 for the native PGHS-1 (Fig. 2 A). Similar values were found for indomethacin- and flurbiprofen-treated PGHS-1, 0.28 and 0.58 s−1, respectively. These rate constants for the initial spectral transition in the 0.1–1-s range were of the same order as the corresponding peroxidase inactivation rate constants for inhibitor-treated PGHS-1, 0.2 and 0.4 s−1(Fig. 1). The fitted rate constant for the second spectral step for the native PGHS-1 was 0.055 s−1. This is similar to those obtained for the two inhibitor-treated samples (0.043 and 0.050 s−1) and about an order of magnitude slower than the first step. The three spectral species deconvoluted from data acquired after 0.1 s are shown in Fig. 2 (spectrab, c and d in both panels). The qualitatively different nature of spectral changes in the early phase (increasing above and decreasing below 403–404 nm) and in the later phase (decreasing both above and below the isosbestic point at 403–404 nm) (Fig. 2) confirms that spectra b andc reflect distinct intermediates even though their spectral line shapes are similar. The spectral changes observed during conversion from Intermediate II (spectrum b) to IIIa (spectrum c) for inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 (Fig. 2,B and C) differed only marginally in the position of the isosbestic point and the direction of amplitude changes on either side of the isosbestic point from those observed for the Intermediate II to III transition in native PGHS-1 (Fig.2 A). The presence of cyclooxygenase inhibitor thus did not markedly alter the transitions in heme optical spectrum during peroxidase self-inactivation. Diode array stopped-flow data for reaction between indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 and PPHP gave results similar to those shown for reaction with EtOOH (data not shown), indicating that the spectral transitions observed are independent of the peroxide structure. Flurbiprofen- and indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 reacted for various lengths of time with 10 eq of EtOOH were chemically quenched and analyzed by HPLC, with heme-containing components monitored at 400 nm and protein-containing components monitored at 220 nm (Fig. 3). The chromatographic profile for the flurbiprofen-PGHS-1 control (mixing with buffer instead of EtOOH) in panel A showed a prominentA220 peak corresponding to PGHS-1 protein (peak 3) and a prominent A400 peak (peak 2) corresponding to native heme dissociated from the protein. For the sample reacted with EtOOH for 20 s shown in panel B, there was a ∼50% decrease in the amount of free heme (peak 2) and an increase in two heme products (peaks 1 and 3). Peak 1 had a shorter retention time (∼22 min) than heme itself (∼24 min) and had little 220 nm absorbance, suggesting that it represented a heme derivative not associated with the protein. Peak 3 had significant absorbance at both 400 and 220 nm, indicating that it represented a heme adduct to the protein. Chromatographic profiles from a parallel experiment with indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 (Fig. 3, panels C andD) were very similar to those for flurbiprofen-treated PGHS-1. The fact that peak 1 had a shorter retention time than intact heme, along with its Soret maximum at 398 nm (data not shown), was reminiscent of an iron chlorin product formed during reaction of myoglobin with H2O2 (23Sugiyama K. Highet R. Woods A. Cotter R.J. Osawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, a further comparison between peak 1 and heme chlorin was conducted. Metmyoglobin was treated with hydrogen peroxide at pH 4.7 to generate the chlorin product (23Sugiyama K. Highet R. Woods A. Cotter R.J. Osawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for analysis by HPLC. The retention time of the chlorin standard peak at about 22 min (Fig.4 B) coincided with that for peak 1 from self-inactivated flurbiprofen-treated PGHS-1 (Fig.4 A), as confirmed by the increased peak height upon coinjection of the two samples (Fig. 4 C). LC-MS analysis was conducted to determine unambiguously the chemical structure of the peak 1 compound(s), as done previously for myoglobin inactivated by hydrogen peroxide (23Sugiyama K. Highet R. Woods A. Cotter R.J. Osawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Parallel mass analyses of peak 1 HPLC fractions from myoglobin/H2O2 and flurbiprofen-treated PGHS-1/EtOOH samples are shown in Fig.5. A dominant species, with anm/z ratio of 632.2, is present in peroxide-treated samples derived from both myoglobin and flurbiprofen-treated PGHS (panels A and B in Fig.5). This m/z 632 ion compound was shown previously to derive from a compound characterized by NMR as a hydroxychlorin (chemical structure shown in Fig. 5) (23Sugiyama K. Highet R. Woods A. Cotter R.J. Osawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The major modified heme compound in peak 1 found in both flurbiprofen- and indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 after reaction with peroxide is thus a chlorin. There are other ions of lower intensity in the mass spectra of the chlorins which most likely represent impurities. The present results do not exclude the possibility that the heme product identified from PGHS is chromatographically indistinguishable isomer of the chlorin identified from myoglobin. LC-MS analysis of HPLC peak 3 from inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 was not successful. To confirm that the material eluting in peak 3 represented heme adducts to PGHS-1 protein, we utilized a chemiluminescence assay developed for detection of heme adducts to myoglobin (21Vuletich J.L. Osawa Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This method is specific for protein-heme adducts because native heme dissociates from the protein during electrophoresis and migrates at the dye front, whereas heme irreversibly bound to the protein gives a chemiluminescence signal. As shown in Fig.6, luminescence indicative of protein-bound heme was found in both flurbiprofen- and indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 reacted with EtOOH but not in the controls, confirming that heme-protein adduct was formed during peroxidase inactivation. The intensities of peaks 1 (modified heme), 2 (native heme), and 3 (heme-protein adduct) are shown as functions of the reaction time with peroxide for both indomethacin- and flurbiprofen-treated PGHS-1 (Fig.7). The changes in peaks 1 and 2 approximated single-exponential kinetics, with rate constants of 0.20 s−1 and 0.40 s−1, respectively, for indomethacin-PGHS-1 (Fig. 7 A) and 0.25 s−1 and 0.072 s−1, respectively, for flurbiprofen-PGHS-1 (Fig. 7 B). The kinetics of changes in peak 3 (400 nm) were more complex, with an abrupt increase at the earliest time point compared with the control, but only slight further increase at later reaction times. peak 2 was the predominant A400 species in all HPLC profiles, accounting for at least half of the integrated absorbance. The peak 2 decay was slightly faster for indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 (0.40 s−1) than for flurbiprofen-treated PGHS-1 (0.072 s−1). The rate of peak 1 formation appeared similar in flurbiprofen-treated PGHS-1 (0.25 s−1) and indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 (0.20 s−1). The rates for the decreases in intact heme and the increases in chlorin were thus comparable to or somewhat slower than the corresponding loss of peroxidase activity (Fig. 1). EtOOH and H2O2 are very poor substrates for the MnPGHS-1 peroxidase, so peroxidase inactivation in MnPGHS-1 was examined with either 15-HPETE or PPHP. Very little MnPGHS-1 peroxidase inactivation was observed in the first 10 s of incubation with PPHP; in contrast, PGHS-1 lost 90% of its peroxidase activity over this period (Fig. 8). The rate of MnPGHS-1 peroxidase inactivation was 0.048 s−1, an order of magnitude slower than the value of 0.60 s−1determined for PGHS-1 under the same conditions (Fig. 8). Also, MnPGHS-1 retained ∼40% residual activity even after prolonged reaction. The peroxidase inactivation kinetics for MnPGHS-1 using 15-HPETE were similar to those obtained with PPHP (data not shown). The effects of peroxide concentration on MnPGHS-1 peroxidase inactivation kinetics were examined with 15-HPETE and PPHP (Fig.9). MnPGHS-1 activity declined in an exponential fashion in these reactions, with the rate constants ranging between 0.033 and 0.050 s−1 for 15-HPETE (average 0.043 ± 0.006 s−1) and 0.018 and 0.048 s−1 for PPHP (average 0.034 ± 0.011 s−1) (Fig. 9). This result indicates that the peroxidase inactivation in MnPGHS-1, although much slower than in PGHS-1, was still independent of peroxide concentration and structure. There was no obvious dependence of the peroxidase inactivation rate on the MnPGHS-1 enzyme concentration because similar outcomes were obtained at two quite different enzyme concentrations (Fig. 9).Figure 9Effects of peroxide concentration and structure on MnPGHS-1 peroxidase self-inactivation kinetics.Peroxidase inactivation kinetics were determined for two concentrations of MnPGHS-1 at the indicated levels of 15-HPETE (panel A) and PPHP (panel B).

These spectral changes are similar to those observed previously during MnPGHS-1 peroxidase catalysis (14Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol.

Kinetic spectral data covering the first 50 s of reaction were optimally fitted by a three-species, two-step model (A → B → C), with rate constants of 0.5 s−1and 0.05 s−1. The slower rate constant for the second step was comparable to the average value of 0.034 s−1 observed for peroxidase inactivation in PPHP (Fig. 9). Deconvoluted spectra for the three spectral species are shown in Fig. 10 B. The spectrum of the first species (X) was very similar to that of resting enzyme (compare spectra a and X in Fig. 10 B). The spectrum of the second species (Y) was similar to that of MnPGHS-1 Intermediate II, which contains Mn4+=O and a radical (14Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol.

The spectrum of the third species (Z) showed the same general pattern as that of the second species, but with decreased intensity (Fig. 10 B).

Transmission-blocking vaccines directed against sexual stage-specific antigens are designed to arrest the development of sporogonic stages inside the mosquito, thereby reducing the infectivity of the mosquito and thereby prohibiting the spread of the disease. Major obstacles in developing a transmission-blocking vaccine are the production of correctly folded Pfs48/45 because of the conformational nature of the Pfs48/45 epitope. A large panel of anti-Pfs48/45 mAbs was needed for a number of reasons: 1) to elucidate the relationship between Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 and 2) to measure and characterize anti-Pfs48/45 antibodies in experimental and field sera. Phage display antibodies offer a method for the production of high affinity single chain variable fragment (scFv) derivatives of human antibodies of “natural host” origin (for reviews, see Ref.7Burton D.R. Barbas C.F. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 191-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our objective was to produce human mAbs against Pfs48/45, a sexual stage antigen of P. falciparum. For this study combinatorial phage display libraries were constructed using B-lymphocytes fromP. falciparum gametocyte carriers with transmission-blocking immunity. Subsequently, phages were selected from these libraries by panning on Pfs48/45 antigen and phages bound to the antigen eluted by competition with mAbs (8Meulemans E.V. Slobbe R. Wasterval P. Ramaekers F.C.S. van Eys G.J.J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This method resulted in human scFv antibodies directed against epitope III of Pfs48/45. Mature P. falciparum gametocytes (NF54 strain) were produced in a semi-automated system as described previously (12Ponnudurai T. Lensen A.H.W. Leeuwenberg A.D.E.M. Meuwissen J.H.E.Th. Trans. R. Soc.

The purified gametocytes were (a) used directly, in immunofluorescence assays (see below), or (b) stored at −70 °C until used. Gametocyte antigens were extracted using 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each DNase and RNase. Insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature), and the supernatant was stored at −20 °C until used for Western blot analysis, for immobilization of Pfs48/45 in the phage selection procedure, or in ELISAs.

Labeling of mAb P5D4 with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was performed using the periodate method with a molar input HRP/IgG ratio of 4 (15Wilson M.B. Nakane P.K.

The labeled mAb was dialyzed against PBS, supplemented with thimerosal (0.01%) and fetal calf serum (1%), and stored at −20 °C. In this study, two human phage display combinatorial immune antibody libraries were used. The scFv library was derived from RNA obtained from lymphocytes of (a) 10 gametocyte carriers from Cameroon after pooling of the lymphocytes (Cam; 80 × 106 cells); and (b) a Dutch expatriate (Spa; 45 × 106cells) living in Cameroon for more than 30 years with regular attacks of clinical malaria. The scFv library was made essentially as described by Marks et al. (16Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J. Mol.

The phage libraries were panned for binders using immunotubes (Nunc, Maxisorp) coated with a Nonidet P-40 extract of gametocytes (500,000 parasite equivalents/tube). Elution of antigen binding clones was performed by competition with a mixture of four rat mAbs (concentration of 60 μg/ml each) (recognizing epitope I, IIb, III, and V of Pfs48/45) for 90 min. The eluted phages were then allowed to infectEscherichia coli TG1 host cells to amplify selected phage binding to Pfs48/45. After amplification phages were selected for two additional rounds using the same protocol. An aliquot of each of the polyclonal phages obtained after each round of selection was stored at 4 °C until required. After each round of selection, 96 single clones were screened for binding to Pfs48/45 by ELISA. Clones of interest were characterized by: (a) PCR-fingerprinting using the restriction enzymeBstNI, (b) competition ELISA, (c) sequencing, (d) immunofluorescence, and (e) Western immunoblot (see below). Periplasmatic soluble scFv antibodies and phage antibodies of different clones were produced as described by Marks et al. (16Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D.

Mulder B. Teelen K. Sauerwein R. VanDruten J. Eling W. Meuwissen J.H.E.Th Beckers P.J.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1995; 52: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of anti-Pfs48/45 mouse mAbs recognizing different epitopes (10 μg/ml) in PBS for 30 min. After washing and incubation with parasite extract (200,000 parasite equivalents/well), 50 μl of bacterial culture supernatant containing scFv or phage antibodies were applied. Bound scFvs were detected by HRP-labeled mouse mAb P5D4 and bound phages by HRP-labeled anti-M13 mouse mAb using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Sigma). Adding H2SO4 after 20 min stopped the reaction, and the optical density was measured atA450 nm (Titertek Multiskan MCC/340). Epitope recognition of Pfs48/45 by phage or soluble scFv was carried out by a competition ELISA as described previously (10Roeffen W. Lensen T. Mulder B. Teelen K. Sauerwein R. VanDruten J. Eling W. Meuwissen J.H.E.Th Beckers P.J.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1995; 52: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, Pfs48/45 was captured from antigen extract in microtiter plates. After washes with PBS, wells were incubated with a mixture of 30 μl of test sample and 30 μl of HRP-labeled anti-Pfs48/45 mAb (recognizing various epitopes of Pfs48/45) for 120 min and detected using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as described above. Competition of (a) scFv with phage antibodies or (b) scFv with serum antibodies from a malaria patient was done as follows. After incubation with antigen, the wells were incubated with: (a) 30 μl of periplasmatic scFv antibodies (1:2 diluted with PBS containing 0.1% milk) and 30 μl of phage antibodies (1:3 diluted with PBS containing 0.1% milk) for 120 min; and (b) 30 μl of serum dilutions (ranging from 1/20 to 1/10, 240 diluted with PBS containing 0.1% milk) and 30 μl of soluble scFv antibody fragments (1:2 diluted with PBS containing 0.1% milk) for 120 min. Bound scFvs were detected as described above. The sequencing of selected clones was carried out using the CEQ Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (P/N 608000, Beckman), and the products were analyzed on a CEQ 2000 Dye Terminator Cycle sequencer (Beckman). The sequences of VH and VL genes were compared with the sequences present in the V BASE Sequence Directory (17Tomlinson, I. M., Williams, S. C., Ignatovich, O., Corbett, S. J., and Winter, G.(eds)(1996) V Base Sequence Directory, MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UKGoogle Scholar) to determine the closest germ-line counterpart. An indirect IFA was done with a mix of cultured asexual and sexual stage parasites (NF54 isolate of P. falciparum) air-dried on multispot slides and incubated with 20 μl of culture supernatant (1:2 diluted with PBS) for 30 min. The slides were rinsed with PBS and incubated with 20 μl of mAb anti-VSV-G (P5D4) (10 μg/ml in PBS) for 30 min. After being washed with PBS the slides were incubated with Alexa™-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes; diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.05% Evans Blue) for 30 min. The slides were rinsed, washed, mounted with a mixture of 90% glycerol and 10% Tris-HCl (pH = 9.0) under a coverslip, and examined under ultraviolet illumination with a Leitz microscope. Specific green fluorescence of sexual stage parasites was scored as a positive reaction. For surface IFA analysis, gametocytes (see above) were allowed to undergo gametogenesis for 30 min by resuspension at a 10% hematocrit in fetal calf serum at 27 °C. 108 live gametes were mixed with 10 μl of packed normal human erythrocytes/ml of PBS. From this suspension, 106 gametes (100 μl) were incubated with 100 μl of bacterial culture supernatant containing scFv antibody fragments for 30 min, washed with PBS, and incubated for a further 30 min with 25 μl of the anti-VSV-G mAb P5D4 (10 μg/ml in PBS). After washing with PBS, the gametes were incubated with 25 μl of Alexa™-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes; diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.05% Evans Blue) for 20 min. After washing the gametes with PBS and resuspending them in 50 μl of PBS, the fluorescence of the membrane of intact gametes was observed under UV illumination at a magnification of ×400. For an indication of scFv expression levels in bacterial culture supernatants, nitrocellulose filters were placed in a dot-blotting apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell), and bacterial culture supernatant was applied. Filters were dried and blocked with PBS containing 5% milk for 20 min, bound scFv was detected using anti-VSV-G and alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (Dakopatts; 1:1,000 dilution). Dots were visualized using nitro blue tetrazolium/bromochloroindolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP). For the detection of scFv binding to Pfs48/45 on Western immunoblots, gametocyte extract was fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex; NuPAGE™ 4–12% Bis-Tris gel) under nonreducing conditions conducted by Laemmli's procedure (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) at 200 V for 35 min. Molecular sizes were estimated with SeeBlue™ Pre-stained Standard (Novex). Proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in NuPAGE transfer buffer (Novex) for 60 min at 30 V. Nonspecific binding sites of membrane strips used were blocked with PBS containing 0.1% milk. After primary antibody incubation, the strips were washed with PBS and incubated with HRP-labeled mAb P5D4 (2 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% milk). Strips were washed again with PBS and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma). Two combinatorial human scFv antibody libraries were constructed using B cells from P. falciparum gametocyte carriers essentially as described by Hoet et al. (9Hoet R.M.A. Raats J.M.H. de Wildt R. Dumontier H. Muller S. van den Hoogen F. van Venrooij W.J. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 1045-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After a primary and a second amplification of heavy and light chain genes using PCR and digestion of these products, both VH and VLgenes were purified by Wizard PCR prep (Promega) and ligated sequentially in the pHENIX vector. The diversity of the resulting libraries was more than 108 individual clones (TableI). Library quality was analyzed by PCR for full-length inserts (>75%) and dot-blot analysis for percentage of clones producing soluble antibodies (Table I).Table ICharacteristics of the immune combinatorial human scFv antibody librariesLibraryLibrary sizeFull lengthInduction%Cam-λ2.4 × 1088332 /48Cam-κ2.2 × 1088229 /48Total4.6 × 10882Spa-λ0.8 × 1087535 /48Spa-κ0.7 × 1088137 /48Total1.5 × 10876Library size is expressed as colony-forming units/μg vector.

Induction is the number of positive clones versus total clones on a dot-blot after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The phage libraries were incubated with a Nonidet P-40 extract of gametocytes immobilized to the wall of immunotubes. After washing, the bound phages were eluted by competition with a mixture of four rat mAbs recognizing epitopes I, IIb, III, and V of Pfs48/45 at a concentration of 60 μg/ml each. Displaced phages were used for infection of bacteria, grown, combined, and subjected to further selection rounds (in a total of three rounds). After the second and third rounds, phagemid particles were precipitated by polyethylene glycol. No reactivity was found in the Pfs48/45-specific ELISA before selection. The enrichment of the anti-Pfs48/45-specific phages during selection was from an OD value of 0.09 before selection up to OD = 0.97 after three rounds of selection for the Spa library and from OD = 0.10–0.67 for the Cam library as detected in the Pfs48/45-ELISA. The phage concentration applied was the same for each biopanning (1012 colony-forming units/ml). The number of phages bound to the antigen increased during selection from 0.9 to 6.2 × 107 colony-forming units/ml for the Cam library and from 5.3 to 42.0 × 107 colony-forming units/ml for the Spa library. After the third round of selection, 96 clones from each library were analyzed by PCR for full-length inserts, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction was performed to obtain soluble scFv expression for ELISA analysis. 53% of the clones from the Spa library and 60% of the Cam library expressed soluble scFv as analyzed by the dot blot technique. The percentage of clones after the third selection with full-length inserts was 33% for both libraries (data not shown). 30 ELISA-positive clones from each library were subjected to fingerprinting. The Spa library gave eight different fingerprint patterns, whereas the Cam library yielded six different fingerprint patterns, which differed from those obtained from the Spa library (data not shown). The positive clones (from both libraries) in the competition-ELISA competed for epitope III of Pfs48/45, whereas no competition was found for epitopes I, IIb, and V of Pfs48/45 (data not shown). Eleven clones selected from the two human libraries were further analyzed by sequence analysis (Fig. 1) and grouped as depicted in Table II. A comparison with the sequences of germ-line VH genes shows that the clones use a VH1, VH3, or VH4 family-derived germ-line segment. Alignment with the VL germ-line sequences showed that these clones use a VL2 or VKI family segment. Most mutations are found in the clones derived from germ-line geneDP15 of the VH1 family.Table IIReactivity of various clones in the ELISA and immunofluorescence assay and the V-gene family, germ-line (derivation) of antibody fragments selected from patient-derived librariesCloneODIFASIFAV-gene family, germ-line (derivation)VHVLSequenceGerm-line geneMutSequenceGerm-line geneMutSF30.13+++A1DP15(VH1)20K1DPK9(VKI)3SF50.23+++A3DP15(VH1)17K2DPK9 (VKI)5SG100.80+/−+A1DP15(VH1)20K3DPK9 (VKI)2SB120.10+++A1DP15(VH1)20K4DPK9 (VKI)11SC80.31+++A1DP15(VH1)20L1DPL11 (VL2)3SF10.24+++A1DP15(VH1)20L2DPL11 (VL2)8KB60.13++A1DP15(VH1)20K5DPK9 (VKI)9KG20.12+++A2DP15(VH1)12K5DPK9 (VKI)9KH91.50−−B1DP65(VH4)10L1DPL11 (VL2)3KC41.28−−C1DP50(VH3)7K*SG31.35−−NSK5DPK9(VKI)9OD, optical density value in the competition ELISA for epitope III of Pfs48/45; (S)IFA: −, negative; +/−, weak positive; +, positive; ++, strong positive.

Clones beginning with an S were selected from the Spa library, and those beginning with K from the Cam library. These clones were analyzed further by Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence assay, and competition ELISA. Western blotting was performed with soluble scFv using sequential Nonidet P-40 and SDS extracts from gametocytes. Six clones of the Spa library and two clones of the Cam library stained the typical Pfs48/45 bands doublet, whereas one clone of the Cam library weakly stained a 230-kDa protein band (Fig. 2). Two clones (SG3 and KH9) that were negative on Western immunoblot were also negative in the competition ELISA (Table II). Four clones (SF3, SF5, SG10, and SB12) were selected from the Spa library recognizing Pfs48/45 and an additional 30-kDa protein, whereas clones KB6 and KG2 without the 30-kDa reaction on immunoblot were selected from the Cam library. Clones SC8 and SF1 with a weak reaction on immunoblot are both members of the VL2 family with different mutations compared with the germ-line geneDPL11. Antibody reactivity against sexual stage parasites of isolate NF54 was determined by immunofluorescence analysis. Clear green fluorescence of the membrane of intact live gametes (surface-IFA) was seen for the clones positive for Pfs48/45 on the Western immunoblot, whereas clone KC4 (weak positive for Pfs230 on immunoblot) was negative in both the IFA and the surface IFA (Table II). Six clones from the Spa library and two clones of the Cam library showed significant competition for epitope III of Pfs48/45 in the competition ELISA, whereas no competition was found for epitopes I, IIb, and V of Pfs48/45. All clones positive in the competition ELISA were positive for Pfs48/45 on the Western immunoblot (Fig. 2). Clone SG10 has a weak reactivity in the competition ELISA and also a weak reactivity in the IFA (Table II). The competition ELISA-positive clones and the uniformity of the VH and VL genes encoding the different scFvs suggested that these clones were directed against the same or related epitopes of Pfs48/45. To explore this possibility, we produced scFv and phage antibodies from 11 clones to test the capacity of phages to replace scFvs after binding to Pfs48/45. The percentage inhibition of binding of scFvs to Pfs48/45 by phage antibodies of clone SB12 is depicted in Fig.3. The percentage inhibition of scFvs binding to Pfs48/45 by phage antibodies from clones KC4, SG3, and KH9 was comparable (data not shown). Phages of clone KC4 did only compete with bound scFv of KC4, and no competition was found with the other clones. The same pattern was also seen for clone SG3 and KH9. Clones SB12 to SG10 showed competition, suggesting specificity for epitope III of Pfs48/45, whereas the clones for Pfs48/45-unrelated antigen did not compete. These results show that phage antibodies from the eight competition ELISA-positive clones (Table II) were capable of inhibiting the interaction of scFv antibody fragments to Pfs48/45 by more than 65%. Collectively, these experiments support the notion that all clones are directed against the same or closely spaced epitopes. The serum of the malaria patient from which the immune library (Spa) was constructed was tested for its ability to compete with anti-Pfs48/45 antibody fragments for binding to Pfs48/45 in comparison with a blood bank donor serum. The patient serum was able to inhibit the binding of scFvs from clones KG2, SB12, and SF5 to Pfs48/45, whereas the serum from the negative blood bank donor was unable to inhibit binding (Fig. 4). The patient serum competes strongly with the three clones, starting inhibition at a reciprocal dilution of 320 for clone SF5, 640 for clone KG2, and 1280 for clone SB12. The other clones (SF3, KB6, SF1, and SC8) gave comparable results (data not shown). Clone SG10, with the lowest competition titer for epitope III of Pfs48/45 (Table II) started inhibition at a reciprocal dilution of 80. Furthermore, 48 serum samples of gametocyte carriers were analyzed in the competition ELISA with mAb 85RF45.3 and scFv clone SB12 as competitor. 16 (33%) of 48 gametocyte carriers were able to compete with both labels in the Pfs48/45 competition ELISA at dilutions varying from 1/20 to 1/640 (Table III). Five (10%) serum samples were positive with mAb 85RF45.3 as competitor but negative with clone SB12 in the competition ELISA. The low titer serum samples (>1/160) seem to be lower with clone SB12 as competitor in comparison with the mAb 85RF45.3. These results imply that the antibody fragments selected from the two different libraries recognize similar epitope regions on Pfs48/45 as anti-Pfs48/45 antibodies present in malaria patients' sera.Table IIIReactivity of 48 sera from P. falciparum gametocyte carriers in the competition ELISA for Pfs48/45 (epitope III) with rat mAb 85RF45.3 and scFv clone SB12 as competitorNo. of patient seraCompetitormAb 85RF45.3Clone SB12320 3-aReciprocal competition titer.0520012020640201404028020380401160160132032016406403-a Reciprocal competition titer. Open table in a new tab In the present study we employed a novel strategy for generating recombinant human monoclonal antibody fragments from peripheral B cells from malaria immune patients. The selection of recombinant human monoclonal antibody fragments specific for the Pfs48/45 antigen from phage display libraries was carried out successfully by competitive elution with mAbs specific for this antigen. This competitive elution technique between a mAb and phage antibody for binding an epitope is based on the principle of a Pfs48/45 two-site ELISA (10Roeffen W. Lensen T. Mulder B. Teelen K. Sauerwein R. VanDruten J. Eling W. Meuwissen J.H.E.Th Beckers P.J.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1995; 52: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The libraries from malaria patients used in this study had at least 108 independent clones with >75% full-length insert ratios. Despite the mix of four mAbs (recognizing epitopes I, IIb, III, and V), used for competitive elution, only phage antibodies directed to epitope III of Pfs48/45 were selected. However, the serum of the malaria patient of library SpA reacted with all epitopes of Pfs48/45 as measured by the competition ELISA with the anti-Pfs48/45 rat and mouse mAbs (data not shown). ScFvs derived from all clones of a VH1 germline gene inhibited binding of rat mAb 85RF45.3 recognizing epitope III of Pfs48/45, whereas scFvs of VH3 and VH4 families did not influence binding in competition ELISAs nor reactivity in the immunofluorescence assay. Interestingly, clone KH9 was negative in the competition and immunofluorescence assays, whereas clone SC8 was positive in these tests. They are both members of the same VL2 family but differ in their VH region (clone KH9 uses a VH4 and clone SC8 uses a VH1 family segment). The same pattern can be seen for clone SG3 (negative in different tests) and clones KG2 and KB6 (positive in different tests). They use the VKI family segment but differ in the VH region. Most likely, the reactivity to Pfs48/45 is not dependent on the VL gene. The selected scFv recognize the same epitope III but differ in their amino acid sequence and possibly in the fine specificity of their interaction with this epitope. We have previously described (11Roeffen W. Mulder B. Teelen K. Bolmer M. Eling W. Targett G.A.T. Beckers P.J.A. Sauerwein R. Parasite Immunol. ( Oxf. ). 1996; 18: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) a fair agreement between transmission-blocking activity using a feeder assay with NF54 P. falciparum parasites and reactivity in Pfs48/45 competition ELISAs using mouse mAbs in sera from gametocyte carriers from Cameroon. These data show that overall the C45 ELISA for epitope III is a good marker for a comparison with transmission-blocking activity in serum samples. Also, Table III shows a good correlation between reactivity of scFv with the sera from gametocyte carriers in comparison with the rat mAb 85RF45.3. However, transmission-blocking activity was found only for mouse mAbs 82C4.A9 and 81D3.D2 (both are epitope III-specific and of the IgM isotype) (5Targett G.A.T. Harte P.G. Eida S. Rogers N.C. Ong C.S.L. Immunol. Lett. 1990; 25: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All other mouse and rat mAbs against epitope III of Pfs48/45 with an IgG isotype show no transmission-blocking activity (5Targett G.A.T. Harte P.G. Eida S. Rogers N.C. Ong C.S.L. Immunol. Lett. 1990; 25: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Roeffen W. van As J. Teelen K. van de Vegte-Bolmer M. Eling W. Sauerwein R. Exp. Parasitol. 2001; 97: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In a pilot experiment, four scFv clones did not block the transmission of the parasite (data not shown). For a comparison with the blocking mouse mAbs, it is better to make Fab fragments, diabodies, or tetrabodies. In further studies, the transmission-blocking capacity of the selected clones will be studied by making these fragments. Also different selection methods will be performed to get scFvs to other epitopes. For Pfs48/45 vaccine development, it is important to study anti-Pfs48/45 antibody profiles in endemic sera after natural infections. So far, the possibility for such study was limited because of high background reactivity when using mouse and rat mAbs to capture antigen. This problem could be resolved in part by using F(ab′)2 fragments; however, different methods failed so far to produce and purify F(ab′)2 fragments of these anti-Pfs48/45 mAbs. Because scFvs lack the cross-reactive mouse and rat antibody domains, we anticipated that high background could be avoided. Preliminary data suggest that the background can be circumvented by these scFv preparations. In conclusion, the successful selection of human scFv against Pfs48/45 paved the way for future selection of more recombinant antibodies with possible transmission-blocking activity. This option would emphasize the importance of this molecule as a vaccine candidate. Malaria patient-derived phage antibody display libraries can thus be used to isolate specific immunological reagents of human origin, which is useful in both the characterization of the parasite's antigenic composition and the human hosts' immune response to malaria infection. We are grateful to Marga van de Vegte-Bolmer for parasite cultures."

The best characterized action of this enzyme is on the signaling pathways activated by platelet-derived growth factor, where it plays multiple roles. In this study we identify tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin as a new potential substrate for low M r phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase. Caveolin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo by Src kinases, recruits into caveolae, and hence regulates the activities of several proteins involved in cellular signaling cascades. Our results demonstrate that caveolin and low M rphosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase coimmunoprecipitate from cell lysates, and that a fraction of the enzyme localizes in caveolae. Furthermore, in a cell line sensitive to insulin, the overexpression of the C12S dominant negative mutant of low M rphosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase (a form lacking activity but able to bind substrates) causes the enhancement of tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin. Insulin stimulation of these cells induces a strong increase of caveolin phosphorylation. The localization of lowM r phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase in caveolae, the in vivo interaction between this enzyme and caveolin, and the capacity of this enzyme to rapidly dephosphorylate phosphocaveolin, all indicate that tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin is a relevant substrate for this phosphatase.

Caveolae are plasma membrane-attached vesicular organelles that have a characteristic diameter in the 50–100-nm range (2Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W.

Although caveolae are present in most cells, they are particularly abundant in terminally differentiated cells such as adipocyte, endothelial, and skeletal muscle cells. Recent studies have revealed the presence of at least three mammalian caveolin subtypes, caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3, with different tissue distribution (see Ref. 4Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, and references therein). Different from the role originally proposed,i.e. as a protein that organizes the caveolae structure and accumulates many signaling molecules, a new role for caveolin as a regulator of transmembrane signaling has been suggested by recent data. Several research teams have demonstrated that caveolin is able to recognize and recruit into caveolae, and to regulate the activities of several proteins involved in cellular signaling cascades, such as the heterotrimeric G-proteins, Src kinases, nitric-oxide synthase, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, as well as protein kinase C (see Ref. 4Okamoto T.

The interaction between caveolin and other proteins is mediated through a short stretch of the membrane-proximal region (or caveolin scaffolding domain), encoded by residues 82–101, which recognizes and binds proteins containing the sequence motif ψXψXXXXψ or ψXXXXψXXψ, where ψ is an aromatic residue (5Couet J.

It belongs to the large family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that are divided into four subfamilies: the tyrosine-specific phosphatases, the VH1-like dual specificity phosphatases, the cdc25 phosphatases, and the low molecular weight phosphatases. All PTPs have the active site signature sequence CXXXXXR, and all share the same catalytic mechanism (13Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Arginine is involved in substrate binding, whereas cysteine performs the nucleophilic attack on the substrate phosphorus atom, producing a covalent enzyme-phosphate intermediate, whose hydrolysis is the limiting step of the catalytic process. An aspartic acid residue assists the nucleophilic reaction by donating a proton to the leaving group in the transition state. Although the function of LMW-PTP in microorganisms is still debated (10Bugert P. Geider K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Grangeasse C. Doublet P.

Biol. 1998; 278: 339.347Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), several papers produced in the last few years have indicated that the enzyme participates in the tyrosine kinase receptor function (14Berti A.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Specifically, the enzyme is involved in the down-regulation of PDGF and insulin receptors (14Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J.

Commun. 1997; 238: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the case of the PDGF receptor, the overexpression of the enzyme in NIH-3T3 cells (both as wild type (wt) and as a dominant-negative (dn) mutant (C12S), a form able to bind substrates but catalytically inactive) produces opposite phenotypic effects; the wild type enzyme decreases cell growth rate, whereas the dn mutant increases it. The analysis of this action mechanism demonstrated that LMW-PTP binds and dephosphorylates the activated receptor in vivo. In particular, LMW-PTP is involved in pathways that regulate the transcription of the early genesmyc and fos in response to growth factor stimulation. Recent reports have also demonstrated that LMW-PTP is localized constitutively in cytosol and cytoskeleton, and that upon growth factor stimulation c-Src is able to bind and phosphorylate only the cytoskeleton-associated enzyme. As a consequence of its phosphorylation, LMW-PTP increases its activity about 20-fold, and this strongly influences both cellular adhesion and migration. The target of cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP is p190Rho-GAP, which is phosphorylated on tyrosine after PDGF-stimulation (19Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Giannoni E. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4640-4646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of insulin signaling, the specific involvement of the enzyme in the Src pathway has been demonstrated. Overexpression of the dn form of the enzyme also influences glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis upon insulin stimulation (16Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Finally, the involvement of LMW-PTP in the regulation of other growth factor receptors has been reported. Stein et al. (20Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. Van Etten R.L. Daniel T.O. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) have found that LMW-PTP is involved in the ephrine-B1 receptor function; Rigacci et al. (18Rigacci S. Rovida E. Bagnoli S. Dello Sbarba P. Berti A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Rovida et al. (17Rovida E. Rigacci S. Paccagnini A.,. Sbarba P.D. Berti A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), respectively, have shown that the fibroblast growth factor receptor and the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor functions are regulated by LMW-PTP. In this paper we demonstrate that tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin is a potential physiological substrate for LMW-PTP. Human recombinant LMW-PTP was prepared as described previously (21Marzocchini R. Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Taddei N. Thunnissen M.G.M.M. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) and polyclonal anti-caveolin (sc-894) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphocaveolin (PY14) antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The sc-894 antibody is raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 2–21 mapping at the amino terminus of caveolin-1, while the PY-14 monoclonal antibody is raised against a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to amino acids 9–18 mapping at the amino terminus of caveolin-1. Rabbit polyclonal anti-LMW-PTP antibody was produced in our laboratory. Protein A-Sepharose beads was from Sigma. Soluble PTP-1B (recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein corresponding to full-length human PTP-1B) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Electrophoresis reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were the purest commercially available. Protein concentration was assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA kit) purchased from Sigma. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, stable transfected NIH-3T3 cell lines overexpressing wild type LMW-PTP or its C12S dn mutant (prepared as described by Chiarugi et al. (Ref. 22Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)), and H-end endothelial cells (kindly provided from F. Bussolino, University of Torino, Italy) were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin). NIH-3T3IR (a cell line overexpressing insulin receptor; Ref. 23Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by AR Saltier (Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Ann Arbor, MI). NIH-3T3IR cells transfected with the C12S (dn) mutant gene for LMW-PTP (dnNIH-3T3IR) were prepared as described previously (16Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing with 10% fetal calf serum and 75 units/ml hygromycin, in 5% CO2humidified atmosphere. Prior to cell lysis, 80–90% confluent cultures of cells (NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and H-end endothelial cells) were treated for 30 min with 0.1 mm pervanadate (20 μl of a fresh solution containing 50 mm sodium orthovanadate and 50 mm H2O2 was added to 10 ml of medium). Cells were collected and then lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm iodoacetate. Iodoacetate was added in order to inactivate irreversibly all intracellular PTPs (all members of PTP family contain an active site essential cysteine residue; Ref. 13Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to inactivate any unreacted iodoacetic acid, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 102,000 × g for 40 min. Lysates of pervanadate-treated cells (1.5–3.5 mg of protein/ml) containing tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were incubated at 25 °C in the absence or presence of LMW-PTP or PTP-1B (0.05–0.1 μmfinal concentration). Aliquots were removed at various times for analysis by SDS-PAGE and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Low density caveolae-enriched domains were isolated as described by Song et al. (24Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Briefly, one confluent 100-mm dish, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2), was scraped into 0.5 ml of sodium carbonate buffer (500 mmsodium carbonate, pH 11, 25 mm MES, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were homogenized extensively using a Dounce homogenizer (50 strokes). The homogenate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of 0.65 ml of 80% sucrose in 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above the 45% layer, by adding 2.5 ml of 35% sucrose and 1.3 ml of 5% sucrose, both in 250 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11, 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The gradient was centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 20 h using a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. For the analysis of the resulting gradient, 0.35-ml fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient. The insoluble pellet (fraction 15) was dissolved into 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Western blot analysis was performed using both anti-caveolin and anti-LMW-PTP antibodies. Confluent NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing C12S dnLMW-PTP cultured in 100-mm dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm n-octylglucoside, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Lysate (500 μg of protein) was incubated overnight with 1 μg of anti-caveolin antibody or 1 μg of anti-LMW-PTP antibody. After a 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C, the immunocomplexes were collected and washed extensively (three times) with lysis buffer. The beads were suspended in 20 μl of 2-fold concentrated Laemmli electrophoresis buffer (without 2-mercaptoethanol), separated by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for detection. We have treated both NIH-3T3 and H-end cells with pervanadate and found that protein tyrosine phosphorylation was dramatically enhanced with respect to untreated cells, which contain virtually undetectable levels of phosphotyrosine (25Klarlund J.K. Cell. 1985; 41: 707-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Other authors have previously reported similar findings using different cell lines (26Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 27Vepa S. Scribner W.M. Natarajan V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); the enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation is due to the inhibition of all cellular PTPs by pervanadate. We have performed time-course dephosphorylation experiments by incubating lysates from pervanadate-treated H-end cells with LMW-PTP. Aliquots of the incubation mixtures were withdrawn at various times and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20). Fig.1 A shows the SDS-PAGE analysis, and Fig. 1 B reports the densitometric profiles oflanes 1–4 of panel A. LMW-PTP rapidly dephosphorylates a group of low molecular mass bands (<30 kDa), and at least two additional bands in the 38–55-kDa range. Other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were also dephosphorylated, but more slowly. A similar pattern was observed using lysates from pervanadate-treated NIH-3T3 cells (data not shown). In order to verify the specificity of LMW-PTP in comparison with other tyrosine phosphatases, we carried out the same experiment on the cell lysate using PTP1B instead of LMW-PTP. The result is reported in Fig.1 C; PTP1B has the capacity to dephosphorylate a broad range of tyrosine-phosphorylated protein substrates. Taking into account the findings of Vepa et al. (27Vepa S. Scribner W.M. Natarajan V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that caveolin is the highest phosphorylated protein with low molecular weight in pervanadate-treated endothelial cells, we performed enzymatic dephosphorylation of caveolin immunoprecipitated from the H-end cell lysate. The samples were incubated for different times with LMW-PTP. Western blot analyses performed respectively with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) and anti-caveolin (sc-894) antibodies reveal that LMW-PTP rapidly dephosphorylates phosphocaveolin (Fig.2 A). We have also tested the activity of the phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase PTP-1B on the anticaveolin immunoprecipitate. As expected, this enzyme dephosphorylates phosphocaveolin (Fig. 2 B) in agreement with the finding of Fig. 1 C, which shows that PTP-1B displays broad substrate specificity. The rationale of the following experiments, performed on NIH-3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing wild type or dominant negative LMW-PTPs, is to demonstrate both the localization of LMW-PTP in caveolae and to investigate the mechanism of its recruitment into these membrane domains. We lysed confluent cells and then separated the caveolae-enriched membrane domains from other cellular components, using the density gradient centrifugation technique described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fifteen fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and the localization of LMW-PTP and caveolin was performed by Western blotting. Fig. 3 (A and B) show that both wild type and dnLMW-PTP molecular forms are distributed in different gradient fractions; they colocalize with caveolin (fractions 4 and 5), the caveolae domain marker protein, but they are also present in fractions 12–14 (the loading zone), and in the pellet (fraction 15). In fraction 1 of the density gradient relative to the dnLMW-PTP-overexpressing cells, we have detected a positive reaction with anti-LMW-PTP antibody. The localization of both wt and dn LMW-PTPs in caveolae suggests that a completely functional active site is not required for the recruitment of the enzyme into caveolae. The LMW-PTP localization in the pellet and in the loading zone was expected, since previous papers reported that LMW-PTP is localized in both cytoplasmic and cytoskeleton-associated fractions of NIH-3T3 cells (see Ref. 19Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Giannoni E. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4640-4646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, and citations therein). To further investigate the association of LMW-PTP with caveolin, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-LMW-PTP antibody on lysates from NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing wild type or dnLMW-PTP. Western blot analyses of the immunoprecipitate using anti-caveolin (sc-894), anti-phosphocaveolin (PY-14), and anti-LMW-PTP antibodies (Fig. 3 C) demonstrated that cellular LMW-PTP and caveolin co-immunoprecipitate, indicating that they interact in these cells. Furthermore, the formation of LMW-PTP-caveolin complexes does not depend on caveolin phosphorylation, since we have not observed a positive reaction with the PY-14 anti-phosphocaveolin antibody. This suggests that a site different from the active site of LMW-PTP could be involved in the binding with caveolin. The results described above suggest that tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin is a potential substrate for LMW-PTP. In order to demonstrate this hypothesis, we have performed experiments with cells overexpressing both the insulin receptor and the dominant negative C12S LMW-PTP mutant. Insulin-stimulated and non-stimulated cells (neoNIH-3T3IR and dnNIH-3T3IR) were lysed, and Western blots with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20), anti-phosphocaveolin (PY-14), and anti-caveolin (sc-894) antibodies were performed. As expected, the main effect of insulin stimulation of neo cells is an increased phosphorylation level of the 90-kDa insulin receptor β-subunit (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 2). Insulin stimulation of NIH-3T3IR cells overexpressing dnLMW-PTP causes a dramatic increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor with respect to control cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 4). The overexpression of dnLMW-PTP is accompanied by a slight increase in the phosphorylation level of another band of approximately 60 kDa. The anti-caveolin Western blot shows that caveolin is present in the lysates (Fig. 4 C), but the PY-20 antibody does not reveal phosphorylated caveolin (Fig. 4 A). Nevertheless, Western blot analysis performed with the monoclonal antibody PY-14 (which recognizes Tyr14-phosphorylated caveolin with high specificity) shows that upon insulin treatment caveolin phosphorylation is strongly enhanced in neoNIH-3T3IR cells, indicating that a tyrosine kinase activated upon insulin-signaling is involved (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 2). The overexpression of the dominant negative LMW-PTP causes an increase in caveolin phosphorylation level both in untreated and in insulin-stimulated cells as compared with the control cells (Fig.4 B). Moreover, we demonstrated that, in these cells, caveolin coimmunoprecipitates with LMW-PTP (Fig. 4, panels D–F), and that the amount of immunoprecipitated caveolin is not dependent on its phosphorylation. In the control cells, immunoprecipitation with the anti-LMW-PTP antibody does not result in detectable LMW-PTP levels (Fig. 4 F, lanes 1 and 2). Nonetheless, the samples contain significant amounts of immunoprecipitated caveolin (Fig.4 D). We think that this is due to the low basal level of LMW-PTP in control cells; in contrast, caveolin is revealed in the immunoprecipitate because it forms homooligomers (31Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kübler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), which may interact with other proteins with an unknown stoichiometry. Taken together, the above experiments clearly demonstrate that the overexpression of the C12S LMW-PTP mutant in NIH-3T3IR cells causes the enhancement of the tyrosine phosphorylation of some specific proteins (such as insulin receptor β-subunit and caveolin) because it protects them against the action of cellular PTPs. Some authors have described these kinds of mutant as substrate traps, since, although they are catalytically inactive, they maintain the capacity to bind substrates, thus protecting them from dephosphorylation (28Flint A.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13128-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Wälchli S. Curchod M.L. Pescini Gobert R. Arkinstall S. van Huijsduijnen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9792-9796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The insulin receptor, which is immediately phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation, is an already known physiological substrate of LMW-PTP (16Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); our results suggest that caveolin, which is phosphorylated on tyrosine by a kinase activated upon insulin signaling, is a potential new cellular substrate for LMW-PTP. The cellular level of protein phosphotyrosine is generally very low (25Klarlund J.K. Cell. 1985; 41: 707-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In order to elevate cellular tyrosine phosphorylation, two approaches are currently used. First, physiological stimulation of cells with growth factors, which trigger cascades of tyrosine phosphorylation events, results in tyrosine phosphorylation of only a limited number of proteins; second, treatment of cells with pervanadate to inhibit intracellular PTPs results in the phosphorylation of a large number of proteins. We have used the latter method to obtain cell lysates and immunoprecipitates useful for revealing the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that are rapidly dephosphorylated by LMW-PTP in vitro. We performed time-course dephosphorylation experiments revealing tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by immunoblot analysis with the PY-20 antibody. Our findings indicate that the LMW-PTP dephosphorylates some bands very rapidly, whereas it dephosphorylates other bands only after longer incubation periods. Since Vepa et al. (27Vepa S. Scribner W.M. Natarajan V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported that caveolin is one of the most tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in pervanadate-treated endothelial cells, we performed immunoprecipitation of caveolin species using anti-caveolin antibody. The incubation of this immunoprecipitate with LMW-PTP and the successive immunoblot analyses using both anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-caveolin antibodies demonstrated that LMW-PTP very rapidly dephosphorylates phosphocaveolin in vitro. Furthermore, both immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-LMW-PTP or anti-caveolin antibodies and cellular fractionation experiments in wtNIH-3T3 or dnNIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that LMW-PTP is associated with caveolin in caveolae membrane enriched domainsin vivo. Moreover, we have demonstrated that this interaction does not require caveolin phosphorylation (Fig.3 C); instead, it is in all probability mediated by a LMW-PTP sequence motif similar to those found in other caveolin-binding proteins. In fact, Couet et al. (5Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), using the caveolin scaffolding domain to select random peptide ligands from phage display libraries, proposed the following caveolin-binding motifs: ψXψXXXXψ or ψXXXXψXXψ (where ψ is an aromatic residue and X is any amino acid). Interestingly, in that study, nearly 10% of the selected 15-mer peptides contained only two aromatic residues. The authors also reported that, although a caveolin consensus motif including four aromatic residues (ψXψXXXXψXXψ) has been identified in several Gα subunits, Gαq uses valine and leucine as substitutions for two of these aromatic residues. Despite this substitution, Gαq has been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with caveolin. Thus, it seems possible that caveolin-binding requirements are broader than described previously. Recently, the caveolin-binding sequences of other caveolin-binding proteins have been described. Carman et al. (32Carman C.V. Lisanti M.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8858-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have reported that all known G-protein-coupled receptor kinases contain the conserved caveolin-binding motif (I/L)XXXXFXXF. We have observed that this caveolin-binding motif is also present in LMW-PTP (residues 77–85) (33Caselli A. Pazzagli L. Paoli P. Manao G. Camici G. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting that caveolin interacts with this LMW-PTP region. There is increasing evidence that caveolae play a major role in organizing signal transduction at the cell surface (3Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 34Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Different hormone receptors and signal transducers are localized in caveolae, and specific signaling events originate in caveolae, including the EGF-dependent activation of Raf-1 (35Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), interleukin-1β-stimulated production of ceramide (36Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and PDGF receptor kinase cascade (37Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Furthermore, caveolin-1 is directly involved in the modulation of the activity of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins in vitro (38Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolae may be involved in the organization of these molecules, a necessary step for the integration of different sources of information during signal transduction. Caveolin-1 exists in vivo as two molecular species (α and β) that differ in their NH2-terminal sequences. These two species derive from a single gene through alternate initiation during translation; α-caveolin contains residues 1–178, whereas β-caveolin contains residues 32–178. Li et al. (6Li S. Seitz R. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 71: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) detected tyrosine phosphorylation only in the β-isoform of caveolin in the Rat-1 cell line expressing a temperature-sensitive pp60v-src kinase. Tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin has also been detected in normal cells, but appears to occur in a strictly regulated fashion. For example, insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 only in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in fibroblasts (preadipocytes), despite the fact that both cell types express caveolin-1 and active insulin receptors (7Mastick C.C.

However, several reports suggest some cellular implications of caveolin phosphorylation. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 has been linked to cell transformation by v-Src (41Glenney Jr., J.R. Zokas L. J.

Recently, Kim et al. (45Kim Y.-N. Wiepz G.J. Guadarrama A.G. Bertics P.J. J. Biol.

An enhanced level of wild type EGF receptor was detected in various human cancers (46Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Among other possible effects, tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 may alter cholesterol binding to the caveolae and membrane structure (39Ko Y.-G. Liu P. Pathak R.K. Craig L.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In fact, several studies have demonstrated that caveolin-1 is a cholesterol-binding protein (55Murata M. Peränen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) and that cholesterol is an important component of caveolae. Furthermore, the observed traffic of caveolin-1 between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus has been implicated in the transport of cholesterol to caveolae (56Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Taking into account that cholesterol level of the caveolae membrane may be involved in the regulation of mitogenesis, tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 may improve the transport of cholesterol, determining a loss of this important component in the caveolae, and thereby altering their structure/function, with consequent effects on cell growth control (45Kim Y.-N.

In the present study, using a monoclonal antibody highly specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin (PY-14) (57Lee H. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T.

This effect is produced by the protection exerted by dnLMW-PTP against the dephosphorylating action of endogenous LMW-PTP and other cellular PTPs on tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin. Insulin stimulation causes a dramatic increase of the amount of phosphocaveolin level in the dnNIH-3T3IR cells with respect to neo NIH-3T3IR cells, demonstrating that phosphorylated caveolin is a cellular target for LMW-PTP. Eukaryotic cells contain a very large number of different PTPs that probably act specifically on different cellular substrates and in different cellular sites. The identification of the physiological substrates of PTPs is a key element in understanding the biological function of this family of enzymes. Taken together, our results on the localization of LMW-PTP in caveolae, on the in vivointeraction between LMW-PTP and caveolin, and on the capacity of this enzyme to rapidly dephosphorylate phosphocaveolin indicate that tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin is a relevant substrate for LMW-PTP. We suggest that this enzyme is a good candidate for the cellular regulation of phosphorylated caveolin level, with consequent implications in all the processes that are affected by caveolin phosphorylation on tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1992456159,"Plasmatocyte spreading peptide (PSP) is a 23-amino acid cytokine that induces a class of insect immune cells called plasmatocytes to spread on foreign surfaces. The structure of PSP consists of a disordered N terminus (residues 1–6) and a well-defined core (residues 7–23) stabilized by a disulfide bridge between Cys7 and Cys19, hydrophobic interactions, and a short β-hairpin. Structural comparisons also indicate that the core region of PSP adopts an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like fold very similar to the C-terminal subdomain of EGF-like module 5 of thrombomodulin. To identify residues important for plasmatocyte spreading activity, we bioassayed PSP mutants in which amino acids were either replaced with alanine or deleted. Within the well-defined core of PSP, alanine replacement of Cys7 and Cys19 (C7.19A) eliminated all activity. Alanine replacement of Arg13 reduced activity ∼1000-fold in comparison to wild-type PSP, whereas replacement of the other charged residues (Asp16, Arg18, Lys20) surrounding Cys19 diminished activity to a lesser degree. The point mutants Y11A, T14A, T22A, and F23A had activity identical or only slightly reduced to that of wild-type PSP. The mutant PSP-(7–23) lacked the entire unstructured domain of PSP and was found to have no plasmatocyte spreading activity. Surprisingly, E1A and N2A had higher activity than wild-type PSP, but F3A had almost no activity. We thus concluded that the lack of activity for PSP-(7–23) was largely due to the critical importance of Phe3. To determine whether reductions in activity correlated with alterations in tertiary structure, we compared the C7.19A, R13A, R18A, and F3A mutants to wild-type PSP by NMR spectroscopy. As expected, the simultaneous replacement of Cys7 and Cys19 profoundly affected tertiary structure, but the R13A, R18A, and F3A mutants did not differ from wild-type PSP. Collectively, these results indicate that residues in both the unstructured and structured domains of PSP are required for plasmatocyte-spreading activity.

During an encapsulation response, circulating blood cells (hemocytes) attach to the target and one another to form a smooth capsule comprised of overlapping layers of cells. The two types of hemocytes most often observed in capsules formed by Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) are granular cells and plasmatocytes. In the moth Pseudoplusia includens, some foreign entities are recognized by factors in plasma, but most are recognized by surface receptors on granular cells (3Pech L.L. Trudeau D. Strand M.R.

After attaching to the target, granular cells and/or humoral opsonins then induce plasmatocytes to change from non-adhesive to strongly adhesive cells that form the capsule. Previously, we determined that plasmatocyte activation is mediated by a 23-amino acid cytokine named plasmatocyte spreading peptide (PSP)1 2The atomic coordinates and structure factors of PSP can be accessed through NCBI Protein Data base under NCBI accession 6729988 (11Volkman B.J.

Both purified and synthetic PSP induce plasmatocytes to rapidly adhere and spread across foreign surfaces at concentrations ≥ 1 nm (6Clark K. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol.

Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Based on the consensus sequence of their N termini (Glu-Asn-Phe-X-X-Gly-Cys), these peptides are now referred to as the ENF peptide family (9Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PSP is expressed by granular cells and fat body as a propeptide of 142 residues with the PSP sequence located at the C terminus (10Clark K. Witherell A. Strand M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This biologically inactive precursor is then cleaved by an unknown protease to release the mature peptide. The three-dimensional structure of PSP consists of a disordered N terminus (residues 1–6) and a well-defined core (residues 7–22) stabilized by a disulfide bond and a short β-hairpin turn (11Volkman B.J.

Comparison with other proteins reveals that, despite sequence identity at only four positions, the core region of PSP adopts a very similar structure to the C-terminal subdomain of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) and the anticoagulant protein thrombomodulin (hTM5). No consensus binding site has yet been identified for EGF domains and their receptors, but several studies have implicated the C-loop as a critical region for binding (12Nagashima M. Lundh E.

In contrast, the consensus sequence for the N terminus of PSP is known only among members of the ENF peptide family (9Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, we used an alanine scanning mutagenesis approach to identify residues critical for the plasmatocyte spreading activity of PSP. Our results indicate that selected residues in both the core and unstructured domains of PSP are required for plasmatocyte spreading activity. P. includens larvae were reared on artificial diet at 27 °C and with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod (16Strand M.R. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1990; 83: 538-544Crossref Google Scholar). Moths were fed 20% sucrose in water and maintained under identical environmental conditions. P. includenshemolymph contains four hemocyte types (plasmatocytes, granular cells, spherule cells, and oenocytoids) with plasmatocytes and granular cells accounting for 30 and 65%, respectively, of the total hemocyte population (3Pech L.L. Trudeau D. Strand M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Gardiner E.M.M. Strand M.R. J. Insect Physiol. 1999; 45: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hemocytes were collected by anesthetizing 36- to 48-h fifth instar larvae with CO2 and bleeding them from an incision across the last abdominal segment. Hemolymph was collected in a microcentrifuge tube containing anticoagulant buffer (98 mm NaOH, 186 mm NaCl, 17 mm Na2EDTA, and 41 mm citric acid, with pH adjusted to 4.5). The ratio of hemolymph to buffer was approximately 1:5. Hemocytes were pelleted for 1 min at 200 ×g, and the plasma-buffer supernatant was then removed. Hemocytes were then resuspended in 1 ml of fresh anticoagulant. After a 40-min incubation at 4 °C, hemocytes were washed twice by centrifugation in Ex-cell 400 medium (JRH Biosciences). Plasmatocytes were isolated to high purity by loading hemocytes from 8–10 larvae onto Percoll step-gradients made in 12- × 75-mm plastic tubes (Falcon 352058). Gradients were made in Ex-cell 400 in two layers: a 2-ml bottom layer of 62.5% Percoll (100% Percoll equals 9 parts Percoll to 1 part 10× Pringle's saline (150 mm NaCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Dextrose), and a 2-ml top layer of 47.5% Percoll. Plasmatocytes with an average purity of 93% were collected from the 47.5–62.5% Percoll interface whereas the other hemocyte types (granular cells, spherule cells, and oenocytoids) banded elsewhere in the gradient. The number of plasmatocytes collected per gradient ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 × 106 cells with the primary contaminant being granular cells. The plasmatocyte spreading activity of wild-type and mutant peptides was assayed in 96-well culture plates (Corning) as described by Clarket al. (6Clark K. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Plates were prepared by first adding the indicated peptide solution (6 μl at 10× the desired final concentration) to each well. Wells were then filled with 54 μl of Ex-cell 400 medium containing 1 × 103 plasmatocytes. The percentage of plasmatocytes that spread in an assay was scored 1 h after adding peptide by counting 100 cells from a randomly selected field of view. Plasmatocytes were scored as spread if they assumed a flattened morphology and were ≥35 μm along their longest axis (3Pech L.L. Trudeau D. Strand M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Clark K. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Unspread plasmatocytes in contrast remained spheroidal in shape. Each mutant peptide was bioassayed four times using an independently collected sample of plasmatocytes. Bioassays with each mutant peptide were always paired with bioassays of wild-type PSP to control for any variation in spreading response that might exist between plasmatocyte samples. The estimated maximum spreading response was defined as the percentage of plasmatocytes that spread when cultured in the highest concentration of peptide tested (10 μm). The lowest concentration of peptide that induced ≥5% of plasmatocytes to spread was referred to as the threshold spreading response. Threshold spreading responses were determined empirically from dose-response curves. All peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The resin peptide was cleaved and deprotected for 4 h in reagent K (19King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), a mixture containing 5% phenol, 1.25% water, 2.5% thioanisole, and 2.5% dithioethane in TFA. After removing the resin from the reaction mixture by filtration, the peptide was precipitated in coldt-butylmethyl ether, followed by repeated ether washes and air drying. Peptides were resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Disulfide bond formation was periodically monitored by 5-μl injections onto an HPLC (Rheodyne 9725i manual injector, Hitachi L-6220 pump, Hitachi L-4500A photodiode array detector, and Hitachi D-7000 chromatography software), where the reduced and oxidized peptides eluted in separate peaks on a C18 column (5-μm particle size, 4.6 mm x 25 cm, Supelco 58298) using HPLC-grade H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–80 min, 20–60%) at 0.5 ml/min. Both the H2O and the acetonitrile contained 0.05% TFA. After the conversion was complete, the sample was purified by a series of 1-ml injections onto a preparatory HPLC column (5-μm particle size, 10 mm × 25 cm, Jupiter, Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA) using HPLC-grade H2O and a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–80 min, 10–50%) at 3 ml/min. Both the H2O and the acetonitrile contained 0.05% TFA. The desired peak was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and disulfide bond formation was confirmed by NMR. After numerous purification runs, peaks were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in HPLC-grade H2O for the determination of amino acid composition and concentration. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized peptide in 0.5 ml of a buffer containing 90% H2O-10% D2O and 20 mm sodium phosphate and adjusting the final pH to 6.0. Peptide concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 mm. All NMR spectra were recorded at 10 °C on Bruker DMX600 or DMX750 spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance (1H/13C/15N) probes and three-axis pulsed field gradient capabilities. One-dimensional 1H spectra were acquired with 4096 complex points and a spectral width of 12.5 ppm. Two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra were acquired at 600.13 MHz on the mutants C7.19A, R13A, R18A, and F3A with spectral widths of 6944.44 Hz in both dimensions, and time domain data sizes of 1024 and 512 complex points in the direct and indirect dimensions, respectively. Mixing periods of 75 and 300 ms were used for the TOCSY and NOESY experiments, respectively. All Fourier transformations of NMR data were performed with the NIH-produced software nmrPipe (20Delagalio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293PubMed Google Scholar), and chemical shift assignments were obtained using the program XEASY (11Volkman B.J. Anderson M.E. Clark K.D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. Markley J.L. J.

The tertiary structure of PSP reveals a disordered N terminus (residues 1–6) and a well ordered domain (residues 7–22) stabilized by a combination of the covalent disulfide linkage between Cys7 and Cys19, hydrogen bonding within the β-hairpin, and hydrophobic packing (Fig.1 A).

Comparing the primary sequences of these peptides to PSP indicated that the most variable positions were positions 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12 (Fig. 1 B). Some variation also existed at positions 11, 15, 21, and 23 (Fig.1 B). Prolines were present at positions 9, 15, and 21 in some family members, which could potentially alter their backbone structure in comparison to PSP. Several family members also differed from PSP at positions 11 and 23, but these were conservative aromatic ring substitutions. The remaining 14 residues were invariant among family members. These included Cys7 and Cys19, Thr14 and Thr22, all of the charged amino acids in the structured C terminus (Arg13, Asp16, Arg18, and Lys20), and the three N-terminal residues Glu1, Asn2, and Phe3. In addition to being identical at these positions, three ENF peptide family members (PSP, Pss GBP, and Mas PP1) are also known to have plasmatocyte spreading activity (see legend, Fig. 1 B). We therefore hypothesized that residues important for plasmatocyte spreading activity most likely reside among these 14 conserved residues and the aromatic amino acids at positions 11 and 23. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized PSP mutants in which amino acids were either replaced with alanine or deleted. Alanine was selected as the replacement residue because of its lack of charge, functional side groups, and because it was least likely to alter the backbone structure of the peptide (17Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1801-1805Crossref Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Cys7 and Cys19 were simultaneously replaced with alanine in one mutant (C7.19A), whereas the first six residues of wild-type PSP were deleted for another mutant designated PSP-(7–23). The other 11 constructs we synthesized were all alanine point mutants. Although Gly6, Gly10, and Gly17 are conserved among all ENF peptide family members (Fig. 1 A), we did not synthesize alanine mutants at these positions, because we assumed the role of these residues was primarily for proper folding of the peptide. The most important element for maintaining the three-dimensional structure of PSP is the disulfide bond between Cys7 and Cys19. Plasmatocyte spreading assays indicated that C7.19A had no biological activity except at the highest concentration tested (10 μm). In contrast, wild-type PSP showed a normal dose-response with a threshold at 1 nm and saturation at 1 μm (Fig.2). We next considered the uncharged hydrophilic threonines at positions 14 and 22. Thr14resides in the β-hairpin of PSP but faces away from the charged residues, whereas Thr22 resides in the less-ordered C terminus (see Fig. 1 A). The T14A mutant exhibited slightly higher plasmatocyte spreading activity than wild-type PSP at all concentrations tested, whereas T22A exhibited activity that was reduced by one-half to one-third at concentrations from 1 nm to 1 μm (Fig.3 A).Figure 3In vitro spreading responses of plasmatocytes to: A, the mutants T14A and T22A andB, the mutants Y11A and F23A. The activity of each mutant peptide was compared with wild-type PSP as described in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As noted above, all ENF peptides have either a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue at positions 11 and 23. Tyr11 appears important for proper conformation of PSP as the side chains of Cys7, Leu8, Ala9, Cys19, Pro21, and Phe23 form a well defined hydrophobic core centered around the side chain of this residue (11Volkman B.J. Anderson M.E. Clark K.D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. Markley J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4493-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Comparison of PSP to other EGF-like subdomains also revealed the presence of an aromatic residue at a position equivalent to Tyr11 in transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α (Tyr38)), the fifth subdomain of human thrombomodulin (hTM5 (Tyr413)), and human epidermal growth factor (hEGF (Tyr37)) (Fig. 1 C). Mutagenesis experiments indicate these Tyr11 equivalents are essential for activity of TGF-α and TM, but not EGF (12Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15McInnes C. Sykes B.D. Biopolymers. 1998; 43: 339-366Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our bioassays indicated that plasmatocyte spreading activity of the Y11A mutant was only slightly reduced to that of wild-type PSP (Fig. 3 B). The activity of F23A was virtually the same as wild-type PSP (Fig. 3 B). We next considered the four charged residues (Arg13, Asp16, Arg18, Lys20) surrounding Cys19. Each of these amino acids resides within the β-hairpin turn with Asp16, Arg18, and Lys20 in opposite orientation to Arg13 (Fig.1 A). Alanine replacements at each of these positions reduced plasmatocyte spreading activity compared with wild-type PSP (Fig.4). The mutants that least affected activity were K20A and R18A, which showed a threshold response at 10 nm and saturation in the 1–10 μm range. D16A showed a greater loss of activity with a response threshold that was two orders of magnitude lower than wild-type PSP. However, the maximal response of D16A did not differ from intact PSP. R13A had the lowest plasmatocyte spreading activity of the charged residue replacements (Fig. 4). The threshold response for this mutant was 10 μm, making it ∼1000-fold less active than wild-type PSP. Although Arg13 is of prime importance for the activity of PSP, data base searches revealed no homologous residue among other EGF-like domains. The lack of defined structure over the first six residues of PSP originally suggested to us that this domain was likely less important for receptor binding and plasmatocyte activation than the highly structured C-terminal domain (Fig. 1 A). However, the conservation of the first three residues (Glu-Asn-Phe) among all ENF peptide family members (Fig. 1 B) circumstantially argued that the unstructured N terminus may be more important for activity than the tertiary structure of PSP suggested. Bioassays with PSP-(7–23) clearly supported a role for the unstructured N terminus in plasmatocyte activation as this mutant had no activity at any concentration tested (Fig.5 A). PSP-(7–23) also lacked spreading activity at a concentration of 100 μm (data not presented). We then tested alanine point mutants in the unstructured N terminus. Surprisingly, both E1A and N2A had higher activity than wild-type PSP with threshold responses shifted to approximately a 100-fold lower level than the native peptide (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, F3A had no plasmatocyte spreading activity from 1 nm to 10 μm and only a low level of activity at 100 μm. We thus concluded that the lack of activity for PSP-(7–23) is largely due to the critical importance of Phe3. The mutant peptides C7.19A, F3A, R13A, and R18A all had reduced plasmatocyte spreading activity when compared with wild-type PSP. To determine whether this reduction in activity correlated with alterations in tertiary structure, we compared these mutants to wild-type PSP by NMR spectroscopy. Because amide proton shifts are quite sensitive to secondary and tertiary protein structure, changes in the β-hairpin or hydrophobic core of PSP can be expected to produce dramatic changes in chemical shift (>0.5 ppm). The 1H NMR spectra of PSP and the aforementioned mutants are presented in Fig.6. As expected, the simultaneous replacement of Cys7 and Cys19 with alanine profoundly affected tertiary structure as evidenced by the collapse in chemical shift dispersion for this peptide in comparison to wild-type PSP (Fig. 6, A and B). This collapse is consistent with the absence of a unique folded peptide structure. Signals from Lys20 (K20) and Met12(M12) at ∼9.5 ppm in wild-type PSP were also shifted far upfield in the C7.19A mutant (Fig. 6 B), indicating that the PSP β-hairpin structure is not formed in the mutant. In contrast, the R13A, R18A, and F3A replacements had no significant affect on the1H NMR spectrum, indicating that the reduced biological activity of these peptides is not due to significant alterations in structure (Fig. 6, C–E). NMR spectra were also obtained on all of the other single amino acid replacements we synthesized, and they too had no significant effect on the tertiary structure of the peptide (data not presented). As a further check on the structural integrity of the PSP mutants, two-dimensional NMR spectra were used to obtain complete backbone 1H chemical shift assignments for the PSP-(7–23), R13A, D16A, R18A, and K20A mutants.1Hα–1HN and1HN–1HN regions of NOESY spectra were also compared with wild-type PSP to identify the patterns of NOEs characteristic of its tertiary structure. Overall, analysis of the one- and two-dimensional NMR data indicated that, with the exception of C7–19A, all of the other mutants retained the tertiary fold determined for wild-type PSP (data not presented). The PSP receptor has not been identified, but the strong similarity in the structure of PSP and the C-terminal subdomains of other EGF-like molecules suggest that PSP-receptor interactions may be analogous to other EGF domain-receptor complexes (15McInnes C. Sykes B.D. Biopolymers. 1998; 43: 339-366Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As such, we initially hypothesized that the ordered portion of PSP (residues 7–21) would be the region most essential for biological activity. The distinction between residues critical for proper folding and those directly involved in target cell binding (and biological activity) are not always clear from mutagenesis experiments alone. However, the small size of PSP makes this molecule especially amenable for assessing how specific mutations affect activity and structure. Our results with C7.19A clearly indicate that the disulfide bond is essential for maintenance of both the structure and activity of PSP. In contrast, the F3A and R13A mutants exhibit greatly reduced activity without a concomitant change in tertiary structure. Arg13 and Phe3 therefore may be especially critical residues for receptor binding. The loss of activity associated with F3A and R13A also indicates that both the ordered and disordered domains of PSP are important for plasmatocyte activation. The three charged amino acids surrounding Cys19 on the β-hairpin (Asp16, Arg18, and Lys20) all align on one side of PSP, presenting a structural motif that may be important for receptor binding. Of these three charged residues, we originally were most interested in Arg18, because arginines exist in analogous positions in the receptor binding domains of both EGF (Arg41) and TGF-α (Arg42) that are essential for binding and activity. However, R18A had only slightly reduced activity compared with wild-type PSP. K20A similarly exhibited a small loss, whereas D20A had a more moderate loss of activity. Based on these results, we anticipate that PSP requires the complete charge sequence (− + +) provided by these residues for normal activity, but we hypothesize that removal of the positive charge at either Arg18 or Lys20 is partially compensated by the other residue, resulting in only small changes in activity. Although replacement of Arg13 greatly reduced activity of PSP, no analogous residue exists in EGF, TGF-α, or TM (Fig. 1 C). The similarity in structure of R13A and wild-type PSP suggests that Arg13 may be a third residue important for receptor binding. Also supporting this suggestion are the results of competition experiments showing that R13A does not antagonize the plasmatocyte spreading activity of wild-type PSP. 3K. D. Clark and M. R. Strand, unpublished results. We view PSP-(7–23) and F3A as the most intriguing mutants, because they clearly indicate that the disordered N terminus of PSP is required for biological activity. The N terminus does not appear to be essential for receptor binding, because both PSP-(7–23) and F3A antagonize the plasmatocyte spreading activity of PSP.3 However, binding of the PSP core may promote a conformational stabilization of the normally unstructured N terminus so that Phe3 interacts with and activates the receptor. Identification of the PSP receptor is obviously essential to testing these hypotheses and identifying binding determinants in this novel family of insect cytokines.

Cellular exposure to genotoxic stress triggers the stabilization of p53 by multiple pathways that converge upon interference with MDM2 function. In this study, we first investigated the ability of HDM2 (MDM2 human homologue) to degrade endogenous p53 in neuroblastoma (NB). Although the p53 protein in NB has been reported to be constitutively stabilized, we find that HDM2 in NB is functional and facilitates the rapid turnover of p53 in nonstressed cells via the proteasome pathway. Second, we examined the relationship between p53 and HDM2 in the adriamycin-mediated stabilization of p53 in NB. We demonstrate that while p53 stabilization depends neither upon the phosphorylation of specific N-terminal sites nor upon dissociation from HDM2, it requires inactivation of functional HDM2. In support of this notion, p53 stabilization following adriamycin resulted in an inhibition of both p53 ubiquitination and HDM2 ligase activity. Taken together, these data implicate a requirement for enzymatic inactivation of HDM2 as a novel mechanism for p53 stabilization in the DNA damage response pathway.

Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), resulting in nuclear translocation and transactivation of numerous target genes. One of the p53-induced genes is the ubiquitin ligase HDM2 (5Barak Y. Juven T. Hafner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar), which acts as a key regulator of p53 activity through its ability to target the p53 protein for proteasomal degradation (6Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, p53-mediated up-regulation of HDM2 gene expression creates a negative regulatory loop, whereby HDM2 inactivates p53 and promotes its destruction, presumably after p53 has exerted its cellular functions. In addition to its role as a ubiquitin protein ligase for p53, HDM2 has also been implicated in facilitating p53 nuclear export, an activity that appears necessary for its ability to degrade the protein (7Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 8Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). DNA damage-induced nuclear translocation of p53 protects the protein from the destabilizing cytosolic effects of HDM2. Stabilization of p53 can also occur by inhibition of p53-HDM2 complex formation, which is proposed to be negatively regulated by p53 phosphorylation at N-terminal sites (9Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 10Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S. Halazoneits T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Indeed, HDM2 nucleolar sequestration mediated by p14arfand stress-induced down-regulation of HDM2 are alternative mechanisms resulting in p53 stabilization (14Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F.

There is much interest in studying the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (NB),1 since this disease is among the most common of pediatric malignancies. Unlike the majority of other tumors, NB is unusual in that the p53 protein is wild type (WT) in the overwhelming majority of cases (18Komuro H. Hayashi Y. Kawamura M. Hayashi K. Kaneko Y. Kamoshita S. Hanada R. Yamamoto K. Hongo T. Yamada M. Tsuchida Y. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5284-5288PubMed Google Scholar); however, the protein is reported to be abnormally stabilized and overexpressed (19Davidoff A.M. Pence J.C. Shorter N.A. Inglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar). p53 has also been reported to be primarily cytosolic in NB (20Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4407-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), presumably due to hyperactive nuclear export (21Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma is additionally complex, in that tumors are composed of a mixture of neuroblastic (N-type) and Schwannian (S-type) cell morphologies that differ in tumorigenicity (22Biedler J.L. Spengler B.A. Toem-ding C. Ross R.A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 271: 265-276PubMed Google Scholar) and in p53 subcellular localization (23Isaacs J.S. Hardman R. Carman T.A. Barrett J.C. Weissman B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 545-555PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that subversion of p53 function by mechanisms independent of mutation potentially play a role in the progression of NB. In this study, we utilized a panel of NB cell lines to examine the relationship between p53 stability and HDM2 function, and we further investigated whether the p53 protein present in N- and S-type cells is equally susceptible to HDM2-mediated degradation. In addition, we examined the dependence for, and regulation of, HDM2 in the stabilization of p53 following treatment with the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin (adr). We conclude that the p53 protein from both NB cell types is inherently unstable, is sensitive to HDM2-dependent degradation, and can be further stabilized by the agents adr, ALLnL, and leptomycin B (LMB). We also provide evidence that N-terminal phosphorylation of p53 and its dissociation from HDM2 may be dispensable for p53 stabilization in NB in response to DNA damage. Instead, we suggest that direct inactivation of HDM2 ubiquitin ligase function may contribute significantly to the stabilization of p53. NB cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) (Biofluids) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1× nonessential amino acids and penicillin/streptomycin and incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cell lines SHEP1, KCN69N, and KCNBU have been described previously (23Isaacs J.S. Hardman R. Carman T.A. Barrett J.C. Weissman B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 545-555PubMed Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. R. A. Ross and B. A. Spengler (Fordham University, Bronx, NY). For these experiments, WT p53-containing SHSY5Y was obtained from ATCC. LAN5 cells were originally obtained from Dr. R. C. Seeger (Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, CA), and p53 null Saos-2 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). MDM2-deficient MEF cells were kindly provided by Dr. Allan Bradley (HHMI, Baylor College, Houston, TX). Cells were treated with either 50 μm ALLnL (Sigma), 10 μmlactacystin (Biomol), 0.2 μg/ml adriamycin (Sigma), or 10 ng/ml LMB (generously provided by M. Yoshida, University of Tokyo, Japan) for the indicated times. For GFP transfections, cells were seeded in 75-cm flasks at 60% confluency 24 h prior to transfection with Fugene (Roche), according to the manufacturer's specifications, and cells were lysed as described 24 h following transfection. Where indicated, 0.5 μg of GFP vector (CLONTECH) was included to normalize for transfection efficiencies. Expression constructs expressing either WT p53 (24Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) or the p5322,23mutant (25Ludwig R.L. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell.

To measure p53 stability, cells were plated into six-well plates and treated with 40 μg/ml cycloheximide for the indicated times. For half-life determination following adriamycin treatment, cells were treated for 6 h with 0.2 μg/ml adriamycin, at which time cycloheximide was added for the indicated times. Densitometric analysis of the p53 signal was determined, and protein half-life was calculated using NIH Image software. The quantitated values were graphed on a semilog scale to derive the half-life for p53. Cells were washed with methionine-free medium containing dialyzed fetal bovine serum and then incubated in this serum for 1 h, whereupon 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran[35S]label; ICN) was added for 2 h. After the labeling period, CHX (40 μg/ml) was added, as indicated, and the cells were lysed as described after the designated times. Cells were solubilized in 1× lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were sonicated, clarified by centrifugation, and quantitated for protein, and 30–40 μg of protein was subjected to immunoblot analysis. Blots were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody and developed with a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by ECL detection (Pierce). For endogenous p53 detection, a 1:1000 dilution of anti-p53 monoclonal antibody DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used. For p53 immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated overnight with a 1:1 mixture of agarose-conjugated 1801 and DO-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For HDM2 immunoprecipitation and detection, 1 mg of lysate was incubated with agarose-conjugated SMP14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight. The resultant blots were developed with either a 1:200 dilution of 4B11 hybridoma supernatant, kindly provided by Arnold Levine (The Rockefeller University, NY) or a 1:500 dilution of Ab-1 (Oncogene Science). For p53 detection following p53 or HDM2 immunoprecipitation, reducing agent was omitted to prevent interference of the IgG antibody heavy chain. GFP antibody (CLONTECH) was utilized at a 1:1000 dilution.

The resulting samples were split into four aliquots, each subject to separate immunoblot analysis. Cells were treated as described, washed with cold PBS, overlaid with low salt lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 5 min. The cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 3000 rpm 4 min. The cytoplasmic supernatant was removed, and the nuclear pellet was washed with low salt lysis buffer. The nuclei were lysed in hypertonic lysis buffer (1× lysis buffer containing 400 mm NaCl) and sonicated, and both fractions were clarified by centrifugation. To verify the integrity of the fractionation scheme, the blots were probed with a 1:500 dilution of topoisomerase II antibody (Oncogene) and a 1:2000 dilution of tubulin antibody (Sigma), representative of nuclear and cytosolic proteins, respectively. Cells were grown on chamber slides and fixed with cold acetone as described (23Isaacs J.S. Hardman R. Carman T.A. Barrett J.C. Weissman B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 545-555PubMed Google Scholar). For p53 immunofluorescence, antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:750. For visualization of nuclear fluorescence, slides were treated for 30 min with 100 μg/ml RNase, incubated for 2 min with 20 μmTOPRO-3 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted. Confocal fluorescent images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scan head mounted on a Nikon Optiphot microscope with a × 60 lens. Images were processed using LaserSharp software (Bio-Rad). The total magnification is × 60 (objective) times 53 times the zoom factor (1 or 1.5, as specified), and scale bars are shown. Cells were treated for 6 h with either ALLnL or adr, and 2.5 mg of protein was immunoprecipitated with SMP14, as described. As a negative control, MDM2 immunoprecipitations were performed from MDM2 null MEF cells. To examine intrinsic HDM2 activity, reactions were carried out in the presence of E1 enzyme (Calbiochem), bacterially expressed wheat UbcH5b (E2), ubiquitination buffer, and either unlabeled or32P-labeled ubiquitin, as described (29Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by either autoradiography or immunoblot analysis. For detection of high molecular weight ubiquitinated HDM2 species, Ab-1 (Calbiochem) was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. In NB, the p53 protein is reported to be stabilized (19Davidoff A.M. Pence J.C. Shorter N.A. Inglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpressed (20Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4407-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) in the absence of mutation, suggesting a dysregulation in its degradation pathway. Furthermore, our prior work suggested that p53 in neuroblastic N-type cells might be more stable and highly expressed than p53 from Schwannian S-type cells (23Isaacs J.S. Hardman R. Carman T.A. Barrett J.C. Weissman B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 545-555PubMed Google Scholar). We have since sequenced genomic p53 from the stabilized N-type lines SHSY5Y and BE1N, and we unexpectedly discovered point mutations. The details of this study will be presented elsewhere. For the current report, we employed only WT p53-containing cell lines, and we further confirmed that the p53 in LAN5 is WT by sequencing exons 2–11. To determine whether the p53 protein in N- and S-type lines is equally capable of being efficiently degraded by the proteasome, we treated two matched S/N pairs with the general proteasome inhibitor ALLnL. As shown in Fig.1 A, the p53 protein from both cell types was maximally induced by a 4-h exposure to ALLnL. To confirm that this stabilization was mediated by the proteasome, we treated the same cell lines plus the neuroblastic LAN5 line with the highly specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (30Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 B, the p53 protein from all of the cell lines was readily stabilized by this treatment, thereby demonstrating that the p53 protein in NB is indeed a proteasomal substrate, in accordance with a recent report (31Zaika A. Marchenko N. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27474-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The p53 protein in NB has been reported to be primarily cytosolic (32Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay A.G. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1669-1678Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar), presumably due to hyperactive nuclear export (21Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The prevailing notion is that nuclear translocation of p53 following cellular stress allows the protein to escape from MDM2-mediated degradation, which requires the cytosolic localization of both proteins (7Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 8Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether p53 stabilization in NB occurs concomitantly with nuclear translocation. Cells were treated with ALLnL or LMB, an antibiotic that inhibits CRM1 receptor-mediated nuclear export of a large number of proteins, including p53 (33Fukuda M. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 34Ossareh-Nazari B. Machelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). By examining p53 levels in purified nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular fractions, we observed that both ALLnL and LMB significantly increased the nuclear accumulation of p53 in all cell lines relative to untreated controls (Fig.2 A), in accordance with previous reports (21Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 35Smart P. Lane E.B. Lane D.P. Midgley C. Vojtesek B. Lain S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7378-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We did not anticipate the nuclear translocation of p53 following ALLnL, since this agent is not thought to mediate a DNA damage response, although similar data have very recently been reported in NB (36Lu W. Pochampally R. Chen L. Traidej M. Wang Y. Chen J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and other cell lines (37Chen F. Chang D. Goh M. Klibanov S.A. Ljungman M. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 239-246PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined the effect of the DNA-damaging agent adr on nuclear p53 accumulation and obtained results similar to that with LMB (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). These results demonstrate that the p53 stabilizing agents ALLnL, adr, and LMB all promote the nuclear translocation and accumulation of p53 in both cell types. To confirm these biochemical observations, the subcellular localization of p53 was examined by fluorescence microscopy following treatment with either adr or LMB (Fig. 2 B). We and others have previously demonstrated the apparently cytosolic localization of p53 in neuroblastic lines when utilizing the monoclonal antibody PAb1801 (21Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar,23Isaacs J.S. Hardman R. Carman T.A. Barrett J.C. Weissman B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 545-555PubMed Google Scholar, 32Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay A.G. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1669-1678Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although this antibody was able to detect p53 nuclear translocation in S-type cells, it did not efficiently detect nuclear p53 in N-type cells (data not shown), in contrast to our immunoblot data (Fig. 2 A). This result suggests that certain p53 epitopes may be inaccessible or masked in certain cell lines, as has been reported for p53 in NB (38Ostermeyer A.G. Runko E. Winkfield B. Ahn B. Moll U.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15190-15194Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, at least two reports demonstrate nuclear p53 in NB when an antibody other than PAb1801 is used (39Danks M.K. Whipple D.O. Mcpake C.R. Lu D. Harris L.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 40McKenzie P.P. Guichard S.M. Middlemas D.S. Ashmun R.A. Danks M.K. Harris L.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 4199-4207PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we repeated this experiment using the monoclonal antibody DO-1, which recognizes an alternative N-terminal epitope of p53. As shown in Fig. 2 B, DO-1 clearly detects the up-regulation and nuclear accumulation of WT p53 in both N and S cell types. Specificity is demonstrated by the lack of staining in the p53 null line Saos-2 (Fig. 2 B, a) and the strong signal detected in mutant p53-containing SKBR3 cells (Fig.2 B, b). These data demonstrate that various p53-stabilizing agents facilitate the nuclear accumulation of WT p53, which can be readily detected with the DO-1 antibody. In addition, we demonstrate that antibody choice can dramatically influence the apparent subcellular localization of the protein in NB. At least one previous report suggests that the p53 protein in NB is inherently stabilized, with a half-life on the order of several hours (19Davidoff A.M. Pence J.C. Shorter N.A. Inglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results in Fig. 1 Bsuggest that a 2-h treatment with lactacystin is sufficient to significantly elevate p53 levels. In general, the ability of several agents to stabilize p53 suggests that the protein is normally labile. To further examine this issue, cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX to determine the half-life of p53. This methodology was chosen over that of radioisotopic labeling because the latter method has been reported to elicit a DNA damage response (41Dover R. Jayaram Y. Patel K. Chinery R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1181-1184PubMed Google Scholar,42Yeargin J. Haas M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 423-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), resulting in a stabilized p53 protein. As shown (Fig.3 A), the p53 protein in all NB lines decreased rapidly after even a short incubation (10 min) with CHX. The half-life of p53 in these lines fell within the range of 10–25 min, and by 1 h, the majority of the p53 protein was degraded. We next sought to verify that the data obtained utilizing CHX treatment was an accurate representation of the half-life of p53 in NB. To test this, we treated cells with adr, which elicits a DNA damage response (43Chernov M.V. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and elevates p53 levels in NB (Fig. 2 B). We presumed that the high expression of p53 following adr resulted from an increase in half-life, which should be detected by CHX treatment. As shown in Fig. 3 B, while the p53 in untreated cells was rapidly degraded, a 6-h pretreatment with adr extended the half-life of the protein to over 3 h. We have previously reported the half-life of p53 in SHEP1 to be almost 2 h (23Isaacs J.S. Hardman R. Carman T.A. Barrett J.C. Weissman B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 545-555PubMed Google Scholar), which is in marked contrast to the value of 19 min as determined with CHX treatment. However, the former calculation was determined following prolonged exposure to radioisotope. We therefore considered whether the addition of radioisotopic label to cells was sufficient to induce a DNA damage response, resulting in the stabilization of p53. We chose to analyze LAN5 cells, since the p53 from this cell type was the most unstable of all of the examined NB lines (Fig. 3 A), yet its half-life as determined by metabolic labeling has been reported to be well over 6 h (19Davidoff A.M. Pence J.C. Shorter N.A. Inglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, LAN5 cells were treated for 2 h with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine, which corresponds to the incubation period utilized for the half-life determination both for our prior work (23Isaacs J.S. Hardman R. Carman T.A. Barrett J.C. Weissman B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 545-555PubMed Google Scholar) and for the previous report (19Davidoff A.M. Pence J.C. Shorter N.A. Inglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar). Following this incubation period, cells were treated with CHX as in Fig. 3 B. Immunoblot analysis of p53 reveals that the presence of radioisotope significantly prolonged the half-life of LAN5 to over 4 h. From these data, we conclude that the p53 protein in NB is subject to rapid turnover and that DNA-damaging agents or metabolic labeling stabilize the protein by extending its half-life severalfold. The stabilization of p53 in response to adr indicates that mechanisms exist to confer resistance to HDM2-mediated degradation in NB. To investigate this issue, we examined whether the p53 in NB was capable of being ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation by HDM2. Cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor ALLnL, and p53 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with p53 (Fig.4 A). We show that while ubiquitinated p53 ladders are barely detectable from p53 immunoprecipitates in control cells, high molecular weight p53 ladders become prominent following ALLnL treatment. The ability of p53 in NB to become ubiquitinated in the presence of ALLnL is in agreement with a previous report (31Zaika A. Marchenko N. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27474-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and further supports the notion that HDM2 is responsible for p53 degradation. We confirmed that these bands represented ubiquitinated species by probing the immunoprecipitated p53 with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (data not shown). The stabilization of p53 following genotoxic stress often correlates with decreased ubiquitination of the protein, as has been observed following UV radiation (44Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first sought to investigate whether the adr-mediated stabilization of p53 correlated with its decreased ubiquitination. Cells were treated with ALLnL, adr, or LMB, and the levels of ubiquitinated p53 protein associated with HDM2 were analyzed. Since this approach detects ubiquitinated species associated with HDM2, it serves to more directly assess the ability of HDM2 to ubiquitinate p53 in response to various treatments. As depicted in Fig.4 B, the p53 protein co-precipitated with HDM2 in SHEP1 and SHSY5Y is visibly ubiquitinated following treatment with ALLnL (lane 2) relative to untreated controls (lane 1), and this is comparable to the levels of ubiquitinated p53 from p53 immunoprecipitates (Fig.4 A). The amount of ubiquitinated WT p53 observed following LMB treatment is also increased relative to untreated cells (Fig.4 B, lane 4), although the levels are less than that observed with ALLnL. This suggests either that some of the residual"

Replication of λ DNA proceeds through a rolling circle mechanism that gives rise to linear concatemers of the viral genome linked in a head to tail fashion (22Furth M.E. Wickner S.H. Hendrix R.W.

Packaging of viral DNA requires the excision of an individual genome from the concatemer, and packaging of the 48.5-kb1 duplex within the capsid. Genome packaging by λ terminase has been described in detail (21Catalano C.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 128-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Catalano C.E. Cue D. Feiss M. Mol.

Packaging initiates with the assembly of the holoenzyme at a cos site in the concatemer. This site represents the junction between the left and right ends of individual genomes within the concatemer (Fig. 1 A). Site-specific assembly at cos is mediated by cooperative gpNu1 binding to three repeated R-elements in the cosBsubsite of cos. Assembly of gpNu1 at cosBpromotes the assembly of a gpA dimer symmetrically disposed atcosN, yielding a stable pre-nicking complex. Site-specific nicking of the duplex at cosN, followed by an ATP-dependent separation of the nicked strands, yields complex I, the next stable intermediate. This nucleoprotein complex next binds an empty capsid, which triggers the transition to a mobile, ATP-driven translocation complex that inserts DNA into the capsid. Upon arrival at the next downstream cos site, terminase again nicks the duplex, and strand separation results in release of the DNA-filled capsid and re-generation of complex I. The gpA subunit of λ terminase appears to possess all of the catalytic activities required for genome packaging, but the efficiency of each reaction is strongly stimulated by the smaller gpNu1 subunit (7Woods L.

Hanagan A. Catalano C.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2744-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and likely contributes to the exceptional stability of the pre-nicking complex and complex I (30Cue D. Feiss M. J. Mol.

Our laboratory is interested in the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms of DNA packaging by phage λ terminase. Central to the packaging process is the cooperative assembly of gpNu1 and gpA atcos (Fig. 1 A).

Toward this end, we have sought to define the properties governing intrinsic and cooperative DNA binding by gpNu1.

We recently described the construction and characterization of two deletion mutants of gpNu1, gpNu1ΔP141 (35Yang Q. Berton N. Manning M.C. Catalano C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14238-14247Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and gpNu1ΔK100 (1Yang Q. de Beer T. Woods L. Meyer J. Manning M. Overduin M. Catalano C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which are proteins truncated at Pro141 and Lys100 of full-length gpNu1, respectively. Studies of these constructs led to a model where the C-terminal 40 residues of the protein are required for interactions with the gpA subunit to form a catalytically competent holoenzyme complex (Fig. 1 B). Residues 100–140 promote self-association interactions that mediate cooperative DNA binding. The N-terminal 100 residues of the protein represented by gpNu1ΔK100 contain the putative helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif postulated to play a direct role in DNA binding. Indeed, the construct is folded in solution and binds cos-containing DNA with reasonable specificity (1Yang Q. de Beer T. Woods L. Meyer J. Manning M. Overduin M. Catalano C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Preliminary NMR experiments suggested that gpNu1ΔK100 would be amenable to structural studies (1Yang Q. de Beer T. Woods L. Meyer J. Manning M. Overduin M. Catalano C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we present a detailed biophysical characterization of gpNu1ΔK100. These studies suggest that the construct consists of a functional N-terminal domain that possess a pseudo-stable C-terminal helix extending from the folded core of the protein. We further describe the construction and characterization of a shorter construct that clearly demonstrates the unusual biophysical characteristics of gpNu1ΔK100 result from this extended C-terminal helix. The biological significance of these results is discussed. Tryptone, yeast extract, and agar were purchased from DIFCO. Restriction enzymes were purchased fromPromega. DEAE-Sepharose FF and SP-Sepharose FF chromatography resins were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega. Guanidinium hydrochloride was purchased from Mallinckrodt. All other materials were of the highest quality commercially available. Bacterial cultures were grown in shaker flasks utilizing a New Brunswick Scientific series 25 incubator-shaker. All protein purifications utilized a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast-protein liquid chromatography system that consisted of two P500 pumps, a GP250-plus controller, a V7 injector, and a Uvicord SII variable-wavelength detector. UV-visible absorbance spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard HP8452A spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature on a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer. A protein concentration of 10 μg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was used, and a buffer blank was subtracted from the fluorescence spectrum. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on an Aviv model 62DS circular dichroism spectropolarimeter equipped with a Brinkmann Lauda RM6 circulating water bath and a thermostated cell holder. Near-UV CD spectra utilized a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in a 0.1-cm strain-free cuvette. Data were typically collected between 250 and 350 nm at 0.5-nm intervals using a bandwidth of 1.5 nm and a dwell time of 30 s. Far-UV CD spectra utilized a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml in a 0.1-cm strain-free cuvette. Data were typically collected from 180 to 260 nm at 0.5-nm intervals using a bandwidth of 1.5 nm and a dwell time of 30 s. The raw spectra were converted to molar ellipticity using,θ=θobs*MRW10*b*cEquation 1 where θ is the molar ellipticity (degrees-cm2/dmol), θobs is the ellipticity recorded by the instrument (millidegrees), MRW is the mean residue weight (formula weight divided by the total number of residues in the protein), b is the cell path length, and c is the protein concentration in mg/ml (36Woody, R.

Protein secondary matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectra were obtained from the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Macromolecular Resource Center. Automated DNA sequence analysis was performed by the University of Colorado Cancer Center Macromolecular Resources Core facility. Both strands of the duplex were examined to ensure the expected DNA sequence. Prediction of protein secondary structures based upon primary sequence data was performed by the method of Chou and Fasman (37Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), using the DNASIS program (Macintosh version 2.0). Calculation of protein secondary structures based upon the far-UV CD data was performed using the SELCON program. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were a generous gift of D. Kroll (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). All synthetic oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and were used without further purification. Plasmids pSF1 and pAFP1, kindly provided by M. Feiss (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), were purified from theE. coli cell lines C600[pSF1] and JM107[pAFP1], respectively, using Qiagen DNA prep columns. All of our purified proteins were homogenous as determined by SDS-PAGE and densitometric analysis using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer and the ImageQuaNT data analysis package. Unless otherwise indicated, protein concentrations were determined spectrally using millimolar extinction coefficients (1Yang Q. de Beer T. Woods L. Meyer J. Manning M. Overduin M. Catalano C.E.

Macromol. 1998; 23: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A truncated Nu1 gene was amplified by PCR using pSF1 as a DNA template. This plasmid contains the wild-type Nu1 gene cloned into a pBR322 background (38Feiss M. Siegele D.A. Rudolph C.F. Frackman M. Gene. 1982; 17: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Primers were designed such that EcoRI andBamHI restriction sequences were present at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the PCR product. The primer sequences used to amplify pNu1ΔE68 were as follows. Forward primer: 5′-CCT CTC CCT TTC TCC GAA TTC ATG GAA GTC AAC AAA AAG C-3′; reverse primer: 5-CTT CCT GGA TTC TTA TTC TTC AAC CTC CCG GCG-3′. The EcoRI andBamHI restriction sequences in the above primers are indicated in italics, whereas the f-MET (forward primer) and stop (reverse primer) codons are shown in boldface. Sequences complementary to the Nu1 gene areunderlined. The stop codon present in the reverse PCR primer yields, upon amplification, a truncated Nu1 gene that expresses only the first 68 amino acids of the protein. PCR amplification, isolation of the PCR product, and construction of the overexpression plasmid (pNu1ΔE68) was performed as described previously (1Yang Q. de Beer T. Woods L. Meyer J. Manning M.

Four liters of 2X-YT media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 5 mm glucose were inoculated with a 40 ml of overnight culture of BL21(DE3)[pNu1ΔE68] derived from an isolated colony. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C until an optical density 1.0 (A600 nm) was obtained, at which point isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1.2 mm) was added. The cells were maintained at 37 °C for an additional 3 h, and then harvested by centrifugation. Unless otherwise indicated, all subsequent steps were performed at 0–4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 7 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) containing 100 mmNaCl, and the cells were disrupted by sonification. Insoluble cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 30 min), and solid ammonium sulfate was added to the clarified supernatant to 50% saturation. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 30 min), and proteins were then precipitated with the addition of ammonium sulfate to 90% saturation followed by centrifugation. gpNu1ΔE68 was found in the 50–90% ammonium sulfate-precipitated fractions. The ammonium sulfate pellet was taken into buffer A and, after dialysis against the same buffer, loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (200 ml) also equilibrated with buffer A. The column was developed with a salt gradient with gpNu1ΔE68 eluting at ≈300 mm NaCl. Column fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE, and the appropriate fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was developed with a salt gradient with gpNu1ΔE68 eluting at ≈280 mm NaCl. As before, column fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE, the appropriate fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A containing 20% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. As required, the proteins were concentrated and/or buffer exchanged using an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). Experiments were carried out with a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a Ti-60 four-hole rotor with six-channel, 12-mm path-length centerpieces. Absorbance optics were used throughout. Three different protein concentrations were used with ratios of 10:3:1, with the highest protein concentrations of 150 μm (≈1.2 mg/ml). Samples were dialyzed against the appropriate buffer and then diluted to the concentrations indicated in each experiment. Sample volumes were 100 μl with the inert oil FC-43 used to displace samples from the base of the cells. Samples were allowed to equilibrate at 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000 rpm. Samples were judged to be at equilibrium by successive subtraction of scans. The density of each buffer solution was calculated based on the salt composition and equilibrium temperature. The partial specific volume of gpNu1ΔE68 was calculated by summing the partial specific volumes of the individual amino acids (39Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides. Reinhold, New York, NY1943Google Scholar). Data chosen for analysis had an absorbance between 0.1 and 1.5 optical density units. Each data point was an average of four scans taken every 0.001 cm. Data were selected for analysis using the program REEDIT (generously provided by Dr. David Yphantis). Individual and simultaneous analyses of nine channels (three concentrations at three speeds) were carried out to resolve assembly stoichiometry. Data were analyzed using the appropriate functions by non-linear least-squares parameter estimation (40Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar) to determine the best-fit model-dependent parameters that minimize the variance. The program NONLIN was used (Ref. 41Johnson M.L. Correia J.A. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar; kindly donated by Dr. David Yphantis). Confidence intervals (67%) correspond to approximately one standard deviation. Non-ideality was not considered, because there was no evidence for non-ideal effects. Models incorporating different assembly stoichiometries were based upon the general equation,Y(r)=δ+αexp[(ς(r2−ro2)]+∑αNKNexp[Nς(r2−ro2)]Equation 2 where Y(r) is the absorbance at radiusr, δ the baseline offset, and α the monomer absorbance at reference radius ro. ς is the reduced molecular weight (ς = M(1 − νρ)ω2/RT], N is the stoichiometry of the reaction, and KN is the association constant of the reaction NM ⇌MN. Thermally induced protein denaturation experiments were performed as described previously (32Meyer J.D. Hanagan A. Manning M.C. Catalano C.E. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 23: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,33Hanagan A. Meyer J.D. Johnson L. Manning M.C. Catalano C.E. Int. J. Biol.

Each data set represents the average of at least two independent experiments. The fraction of protein in the denatured state (FD) was determined using, FD=θN−θTθN−θDEquation 3 where θT is the ellipticity at temperatureT, and θN and θD represent the ellipticity for the native and denatured protein, respectively. Baseline corrections were not performed to demonstrate temperature-induced alterations in the pre-transition baseline slopes. The unfolding curves were analyzed using a complex sigmoidal curve function,FD=(mD*T−bD)−(mN*T−bN)1+TTmmT+(mN*T−bN)Equation 4 where (mN*T − bN) and (mD*T −bD) describe the linear portion of the pre-transition and post-transition baselines, respectively, at temperature T, mT is the slope of curve within the transition region, and Tm is the melting temperature for the transition. All data sets were fit to the above equations by non-linear regression methods using the IGOR graphics/analysis package (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). We have previously described the construction, expression, and biochemical characterization of gpNu1ΔK100, a deletion construct of the small terminase subunit (1Yang Q. de Beer T. Woods L. Meyer J. Manning M. Overduin M. Catalano C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The construct is a dimer in the concentration range of 5 μm to 2 mm, with no evidence for dissociation or further aggregation. Preliminary NMR experiments suggested that the construct might be amenable to structural studies, and we therefore sought to further characterize the physical properties of this construct. Thermally induced unfolding of gpNu1ΔK100 secondary and tertiary structural elements is reversible, as indicated in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. Moreover, the loss of tertiary structure (near-UV CD signal) is cooperative, consistent with a folded and stable construct (Fig. 2 C). 2gpNu1ΔK100 possesses two tryptophan (Trp22 and Trp49) and three tyrosine (Tyr41, Tyr50, and Tyr84) residues. The thermal unfolding data provide no indication for multiple unfolding transitions, which would indicate local unfolding in the vicinity of these residues. We thus interpret the loss of the near-UV CD signal as reflecting global unfolding of the protein. It is feasible, however, that the melting curves reflect regional versus global unfolding of the protein. Salt and protons stabilize protein tertiary structure, as evidenced by the significant increase in the Tm for the transition (Table I). Despite the observed cooperative loss of tertiary structure, thermally induced loss of secondary structural elements (far-UV CD signal) appears essentially non-cooperative (Fig. 2 C). The steep pre-transition baseline observed in these data make it difficult to accurately calculate theTm for this transition. Nevertheless, it is clear that salt and protons similarly affect theTm for the unfolding transition, whether monitored in the far-UV or near-UV region of the CD spectrum (Table I). Interestingly, salt and pH strongly affect the pre-transition baselines obtained in the far-UV CD melting curves, but not the near-UV CD melting curves (Table II).Table ISalt and protons affect the thermal stability of gpNu1ΔK100pH[NaCl]TmTertiary structure, near-UV CDSecondary structure, far-UV CD°C7.2052.2 ± 0.447.3 ± 0.77.2150 mmND 1-aND, not done.52.7 ± 0.87.2500 mm70.2 ± 1.666.2 ± 2.88.0045.7 ± 1.644.2 ± 0.47.2052.2 ± 0.447.3 ± 0.76.0062.0 ± 1.555.9 ± 0.71-a ND, not done.

E. Catalano, unpublished. Primary sequence analysis predicts strong α-helical character in the region spanning residues ≈50 and ≈115 of gpNu1 (Fig.1 B). We postulated that this putative helix might be partially disrupted in the gpNu1ΔK100 construct, leading to the unusual unfolding properties of the protein. If this were the case, limited proteolysis of gpNu1ΔK100 would be expected to degrade the exposed portion of the helix, yielding a fully folded domain suitable for structural characterization. This was indeed correct. Limited proteolysis of the gpNu1ΔK100 with a number of proteases consistently yielded two predominant products (data not shown). Analysis of these products by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry yielded molecular masses of ≈7.5 kDa and ≈10 kDa, respectively.

The active site of Cet1 resides within a topologically closed hydrophilic β-barrel (the triphosphate tunnel) that is supported by a globular hydrophobic core. The homodimeric quaternary structure of Cet1 is formed by a network of contacts between the partner protomers. By studying the effects of alanine-cluster mutations, we highlight the contributions of two separate facets of the crystallographic dimer interface to Cet1 function in vivo. One essential facet of the interface entails hydrophobic cross-dimer interactions of Cys330 and Val331 and a cross-dimer hydrogen bond of Asp280 with the backbone amide of Gln329. The second functionally relevant dimer interface involves hydrophobic side-chain interactions of Phe272 and Leu273. Ala-cluster mutations involving these residues elicited lethal or severe temperature-sensitive phenotypes that were suppressed completely by fusion of the mutated triphosphatases to the guanylyltransferase domain of mammalian capping enzyme. The recombinant D279A-D280A and F272A-L273A proteins retained phosphohydrolase activity but sedimented as monomers. These results indicate that a disruption of the dimer interface is uniquely deleterious when the yeast RNA triphosphatase must function in concert with the endogenous yeast guanylyltransferase.

The budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae encodes separate triphosphatase (Cet1; 549 aa1) and guanylyltransferase (Ceg1; 459 aa) proteins that interact intrans to form a heteromeric capping enzyme complex. Yeast cell growth depends on the catalytic activities of both enzymes and their physical interaction. The binding of yeast Cet1 to Ceg1 elicits two apparently beneficial outcomes. First, Cet1·Ceg1 interaction stabilizes the intrinsically labile guanylyltransferase activity of Ceg1 against thermal inactivation at physiological temperatures. 2S. Hausmann, C. K. Ho, and S. Shuman, manuscript in preparation.Second, the physical tethering of Cet1 to Ceg1 may facilitate recruitment of the triphosphatase to the RNA polymerase II elongation complex. Ceg1 binds in vitro and in vivo to the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, whereas Cet1 by itself does not interact in vitro with the phosphorylated CTD (3McCracken S.

Cet1 consists of three domains: (i) a 230-aa amino-terminal segment that is dispensable for catalysis in vitro and for Cet1 function in vivo; (ii) a protease-sensitive segment from residues 230 to 275 that is dispensable for catalysis but essential for Cet1 function in vivo; and (iii) a catalytic domain from residues 275 to 549 (7Lehman K.

A homodimeric quaternary structure for the biologically active Cet1 protein was inferred from analysis of the purified recombinant enzyme by glycerol gradient sedimentation and then confirmed by x-ray crystallography (7Lehman K.

A Cet1·Ceg1 capping enzyme complex reconstituted in vitro from separately purified components is surmised from velocity sedimentation analysis to be a heterotrimer consisting of two molecules of triphosphatase and one molecule of guanylyltransferase (7Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Is homodimer formation essential for Cet1 function? Deletion analysis shows that the carboxyl-terminal domain Cet1(276–549) has a monomeric quaternary structure, yet it retains full catalytic activity in vitro (7Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, homodimerization is not essential for catalysis. However, the monomeric domain by itself cannot support yeast cell growth, even when it is overexpressed at high gene dosage under the control of a strong promoter. Interpretation of the deletion data is complicated by the fact that an amino-terminal truncation to position 275 also removes the guanylyltransferase-binding site243WAQKW247, which is located on the protein surface (9Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and is responsible for Cet1-mediated stabilization of the guanylyltransferase Ceg1.2 Remarkably, the in vivo function of Cet1(276–549) is completely restored when the monomeric triphosphatase domain is fused in cis to the guanylyltransferase domain of the mouse capping enzyme (7Lehman K.

Also, because the mouse guanylyltransferase is thermostable (unlike Ceg1), the chimeric capping enzyme bypasses the need for the Ceg1-stabilization function of the243WAQKW247 peptide of Cet1.2 To focus specifically on the role of homodimerization in Cet1 functionin vivo, we have initiated a mutational analysis of the amino acids comprising the homodimer interface revealed by the crystal structure (8Lima C. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Alanine-cluster mutations were introduced into the biologically active protein Cet1(201–549), which contains both the guanylyltransferase-binding and catalytic domains (7Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K.

The results of this analysis indicate that homodimerization of yeast RNA triphosphatase is important for its function in vivo. Alanine-cluster mutations were introduced into the CET1(201–549) gene by polymerase chain reaction (12Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The mutated genes were inserted into the yeast CEN TRP1 plasmid pCET1–5′3′, where expression of the inserted gene is under the control of the natural CET1promoter (13Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inserts were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted mutations during amplification and cloning. The genes were excised from their respective pCET1–5′3′ plasmids withNdeI and BamHI and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYN132 (CEN TRP1). In this vector, expression of CET1(201–549) is driven by the strong constitutive yeast TPI1 promoter.NdeI/BamHI restriction fragments containing the mutated genes were also cloned into the multicopy expression plasmid pYX232 (2μ TRP1) with triphosphatase expression being driven by the TPI1 promoter. The in vivo activity of the mutated CET1 alleles was tested by plasmid shuffle. Yeast strain YBS20 (trp1 ura3 leu2 cet1::LEU2 p360-Cet1[CEN URA3 CET1]) was transformed with TRP1 plasmids containing the wild-type and mutant alleles of CET1(201–549). Trp+ isolates were selected and then streaked on agar plates containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). Growth was scored after 7 days of incubation at 25, 30, and 37 °C or 14 days at 14 °C. Lethal mutants were those that failed to form colonies on 5-FOA at any temperature. Individual colonies of the viable CET1 mutants were picked from the FOA plate at permissive temperature and patched to YPD agar. Two isolates of each mutant were tested for growth on YPD agar at 14, 25, 30, and 37 °C. Growth was assessed as follows: +++ indicates colony size indistinguishable from strains bearing wild-typeCET1(201–549); ++ denotes slightly reduced colony size; + indicates that only pinpoint colonies were formed. NdeI/BamHI fragments encoding mutated versions of Cet1(201–549) were excised from the respective pCET1–5′3′ plasmids and inserted into pET16b. Wild-type Cet1(201–549) and the F272A-L273A and D279A-D280A mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) at 18 °C by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 20 h in the presence of 2% ethanol (2Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography as described previously (2Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol.

The 0.2 mimidazole eluate fractions containing Cet1(201–549) were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, then stored at −80 °C. Triphosphatase reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mmTris HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 2 mmMnCl2, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and Cet1(201–549) as specified were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 2.5 μl of 5 m formic acid. An aliquot of the mixture was applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was developed with 0.5m LiCl and 1 m formic acid. The release of32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP was quantitated by scanning the TLC plate with a PhosphorImager. Aliquots (30 μg) of the nickel-agarose preparations of the wild-type and mutant Cet1(201–549) proteins were mixed with BSA (25 μg), and cytochrome c (25 μg) in 0.2 ml of buffer G (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100). The mixtures were layered onto 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradients containing buffer G. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 25 h at 4 °C. Fractions (∼0.2 ml) were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. Aliquots (20 μl) of odd-numbered fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE along with samples of the input protein mixtures for each gradient. Polypeptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue dye. Aliquots (1 μl) of each fraction were assayed for triphosphatase activity as described above. Yeast RNA triphosphatase crystallized as a homodimer (Fig. 1 A). Each protomer is composed of four α helices and 11 β strands. The secondary structure elements are displayed over the Cet1 protein sequence in Fig.2. The striking feature of the tertiary structure is the formation of a topologically closed tunnel composed of 8 antiparallel β strands. In the dimer, the two tunnels are parallel and oriented in the same direction. A surface view of the monomer is shown in Fig. 1 A looking into the tunnel. Rotation of the molecule provides a side view that highlights a platform-like structure in front of the tunnel entrance (Fig. 1 B). The triphosphatase active site resides within the tunnel. The guanylyltransferase-binding site is located on the surface and is colored red in Fig. 1.Figure 2Structure-based mutational analysis. The secondary structure of S. cerevisiae Cet1 from residues 241 to 539 is shown above its amino acid sequence, which is aligned to the homologous segment of the Candida albicans RNA triphosphatase CaCet1. Gaps in the alignment are indicated bydashes. Amino acid pairs in Cet1 that were mutated to alanine in the present study and found to have no effect onCET1 function in vivo are denoted by plus signs above the sequence.

Elements that comprise the dimer interface are strands β2 and β3, helices α1 and α4, the loop immediately preceding α1, the loop between β9 and β10, and the loop between α3 and α4. The molecular contacts of the dimer interface are listed in Fig.3. These entail multiple hydrophobic interactions and a network of side-chain and main-chain hydrogen bonds. The hydrophobic core of the dimer interface is stabilized by interactions of residues Ile268, Phe272, Leu273, and Pro277 (located immediately proximal to α1) with hydrophobic residues on the dimer partner located in the segments from 354–368, 463–467, and 519–530 (Fig. 3). Indeed, the aromatic side chain of Phe272 inserts into a small hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the dimer partner (Fig.1 C). Additional hydrophobic interactions occur between side chains of strand β2 of one protomer (325) and strand β3 in the partner (330) (Table I). Main-chain hydrogen bonds between β2 and β3 form an antiparallel sheet at the dimer interface.Table IEffects of alanine-cluster mutations on Cet1 function in vivoCET1mutantGrowth14 °25 °30 °37 °K267A I268A++++++++++++D269A P270A++++++++++++F272A L273A+++−−I276A P277A++++++++++++D279A D280A−−−−T282A K283A++++++++++++S284A V285A++++++++++++D287A W288A++++++−V289A Y290A++++++++++++P325A V326A++++++++++++S327A S328A++++++++++++C330A V331A−−−−F332A T333A++++++++++++Y354A I358A++++++++++++K367A F368A++++++++++++S466A C467A++++++++++++I470A I472A+−−−L519A I520A−−−−F523A L524A−−−−N525A N526A++++++++++++I529A I530A++−−−+++, colony size indistinguishable from strains bearing wild-typeCET1(201–549); ++, slightly reduced colony size; +, only pinpoint colonies formed; −, colonies failed to grow.

To gauge the role of homodimerization in Cet1 function, we performed alanine-cluster mutagenesis of pairs of vicinal amino acids. The double-Ala mutations were introduced into the biologically active Cet1(201–549) protein. A total of 42 residues (17% of the polypeptide) were changed to alanine in this analysis, 24 of which were constituents of the crystallographic dimer interface. The cluster mutations also embraced residues in helices α1 and α4 that comprise the hydrophobic core of the Cet1 protomer upon which the triphosphate tunnel rests. TheCET1(201–549)-Ala/Ala genes were cloned into a CEN TRP1 vector under the control of the natural CET1promoter and then tested by plasmid shuffle for their ability to complement a cet1Δ strain of S. cerevisiae. The results are summarized in Table I. Growth of cet1Δis contingent upon maintenance of a wild-type CET1 allele on a CEN URA3 plasmid. Therefore, the cet1Δ strain is unable to grow on agar medium containing 5-FOA (5-fluoroorotic acid, a drug which selects against the URA3 plasmid) unless it is first transformed with a biologically active RNA triphosphatase gene on the TRP1 plasmid. Trp+ CET1(201–549)-Ala/Alatransformants were tested for growth on 5-FOA. Triphosphatase mutations were judged to be lethal if they failed to support colony formation on 5-FOA after prolonged incubation at four different temperatures (14, 25, 30, and 37 °C). Four of the Ala-cluster alleles were lethal by this criterion: D279A-D280A, C330A-V331A,L519A-I520A, and F523A-L524A. Four other Ala-cluster mutants displayed a conditional phenotype, whereby they gave rise to 5-FOA-resistant colonies at low temperatures but failed to yield colonies at high temperatures. TheseCET1(201–549)-Ala/Ala strains were isolated from 5-FOA plates at permissive temperature and then tested for growth on rich medium (YPD) at 14, 25, 30, and 37 °C. The D287A-W288Astrain grew as well as wild-type yeast at 14 °C (scored as +++), but formed small colonies at 25 °C (scored as ++), pinpoint colonies at 30 °C (scored as +), and failed to grow at 37 °C (−growth). TheF272A-L273A mutant grew slowly at 14 °C and not at all at 30 °C or higher. The I470A-I472A andI529A-I530A mutations elicited the most severe conditional phenotypes, with weak growth at 14 °C and no growth at 25 °C or higher (Table I). The remaining 13 double-Ala mutants yielded 5-FOA-resistant colonies at all temperatures and grew as well as the isogenicCET1(201–549) “wild-type” strain on YPD agar at 14, 25, 30, and 37 °C. We infer that the 26 side chains that were substituted in the fully viable mutants are unimportant per se for Cet1 function in vivo. These nonessential residues (highlighted by plus signs over the Cet1 sequence in Fig. 2) included 15 amino acids that comprise the crystallographic dimer interface (Ile268, Asp269, Pro270, Pro277, Ser284, Pro325, Val326, Ser327, Ser328, Phe332, Thr333, Ile358, Lys367, Phe368, and Asn526). The Ala-cluster mutants that were fully viable were not analyzed further. The 16 residues substituted in the 8 Ala-cluster alleles that were lethal or ts when expressed in single copy from the natural CET1 promoter are highlighted bydots above the Cet1 sequence in Fig. 2. Six of the eight Ala-clusters entailed substitution of at least one component of the crystallographic dimer interface. If homodimerization is importantin vivo, we reasoned that the growth phenotypes elicited by mutations that diminish the dimerization equilibrium constant might be ameliorated by increasing the expression of the mutant protein, in effect attaining a threshold level of dimeric Cet1 via mass action. Also, if some of the mutations reduced triphosphatase activity to a level below the threshold required for growth, then increased gene expression might restore activity to a supra-threshold level. To explore these scenarios, the lethal and ts Ala-cluster alleles were retested for biological activity in single-copy when their expression was driven by the strong constitutive yeast TPI1promoter instead of the CET1 promoter. Increased promoter strength completely suppressed the tsphenotype of D287A W288A such that the mutant strain grew as well as the CET1 strain on YPD agar at 37 °C (Table II). Changing promoters partially suppressed the ts phenotypes of F272A-L273A,I470A-I472A, and I529A-I530A. Partial suppression was manifest as an upward shift in the restrictive growth temperatures. For example, I470A-I472A under TPI1 control displayed +++ growth at 30 °C, compared with no growth under its natural promoter. F272A-L273A grew at 30 and 37 °C (albeit slowly) and I529A-I530A was able to grow at 30 °C (Table II). Increased promoter strength did not reverse the lethality of the D279A-D280A, C330A-V331A, orF523A-L524A mutations. However, it did restore partial function to the L519A-I520A allele, which was capable of supporting growth at 14 °C, albeit not at 25 °C or higher (Table II).Table IISuppression of Cet1 mutational effects by overexpression or fusion to mouse guanylyltransferaseGrowth14 °25 °30 °37 °CEN TPI-CET1F272A L273A+++++++D279A D280A−−−−D287A W288A++++++++++++C330A V331A−−−−I470A I472A+++++++++−L519A I520A++−−−F523A L524A−−−−I529A I530A++++++−−2μTPI-CET1F272A L273A+++++++D279A D280A−−−−D287A W288A++++++++++++C330A V331A−−−−I470A I472A+++++++++−L519A I520A++++−−F523A L524A+++−−−I529A I530A++++++−−CEN TPI-CET1/MCE1(211–597)F272A L273A++++++++++++D279A D280A++++++++++++D287A W288A++++++++++++C330A V331A++++++++++++I470A I472A++++++++++L519A I520A+++++−−F523A L524A++−−−I529A I530A+++++++++−+++, colony size indistinguishable from strains bearing wild-typeCET1(201–549); ++, slightly reduced colony size; +, only pinpoint colonies formed; −, colonies failed to grow. Open table in a new tab +++, colony size indistinguishable from strains bearing wild-typeCET1(201–549); ++, slightly reduced colony size; +, only pinpoint colonies formed; −, colonies failed to grow. In light of these effects, we proceeded to transfer theTPI-CET1-Ala/Ala alleles to high-copy 2μ vectors and to test the effects of increased gene dosage on their in vivoactivities. This maneuver abated the lethality ofF523A-L524A, which displayed +++ growth at 14 °C, but no growth at 25 °C or higher; it also improved the growth ofL519A-I520A at 14° and 25 °C (Table II). The other mutational effects were unaffected by increased gene dosage; in particular, the D279A-D280 and C330A-V331Aalleles were lethal even in high copy. Even a monomeric version of yeast RNA triphosphatase is functional in vivo when it is fused to the guanylyltransferase domain of the mouse capping enzyme, provided that it retains phosphohydrolase catalytic activity (7Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, a functional test of chimeric capping enzymes containing Cet1(201–549)-Ala/Ala mutants fused to the mouse guanylyltransferase can discriminate genetically whether the complete or partial loss of function elicited by the Ala-cluster mutations is caused by a catalytic defect (be it a global folding problem or a direct perturbation of the active site) or a defect in ancillary functions uniquely required in yeast cells containing only the endogenous guanylyltransferase Ceg1. In the latter scenario, we would expect the fusion maneuver to restore function to the Cet1(201–549)-Ala/Ala mutant, whereas no salutary effects are expected in the former case. 597)chimeras were cloned into CEN TRP1 vectors under the control of theTPI1 promoter and then tested by plasmid shuffle for complementation of cet1Δ. The salient findings were that the D279A-D280A and C330A-V331A alleles, which were lethal even when expressed at high gene dosage, were fully functional at all temperatures when fused to the mouse guanylyltransferase (Table II). We surmise that these two Ala-cluster mutations do not significantly affect phosphohydrolase catalytic activity in vivo. This conclusion is consistent with the distant location of the four mutated residues from the enzyme's active site in the crystal structure (8Lima C. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because the Asp280, Cys330, and Val331 side chains are components of the homodimer interface, we infer that the lethal phenotypes of the cluster mutations reflect a requirement for Cet1 homodimerization for RNA processing by the yeast capping apparatus. In addition, we found that the other Ala-cluster mutants that displayedts growth defects when expressed by themselves in single copy under the control of the TPI1 promoter were suppressed completely or partially by fusion to the mouse guanylyltransferase. Of special note was F272A-L273A, which was fully functional at all temperatures as a chimeric enzyme. The Phe272 and Leu272 side chains are components of the hydrophobic dimer interface (Fig. 1 C), and we surmise from the genetic evidence that the phenotype of this mutant is likely caused by a dimerization defect. On the other hand, the I529A-I530Achimera supported growth at 30 °C, but not at 37 °C, whereas growth of the L519A-I520A and F523A-L524Achimeras was still severely ts. Apparently, these Ala-cluster mutants are defective in aspects other than, or in addition to, Cet1 homodimerization. We produced the mutated Cet1(201–549) proteins F272A-L273A and D279A-D280A in bacteria as His10-tagged fusions and purified them from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography. Wild-type His10-Cet1(201–549) was purified in parallel. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the ∼44-kDa Cet1(201–549) protein was the predominant species in each enzyme preparation (Fig.4 A). Phosphohydrolase activity was assayed by the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of manganese chloride (2Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The extents of ATP hydrolysis increased as a function of input enzyme for each protein (Fig. 4 B). A specific activity for the wild-type Cet1(201–549) of 0.58 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed per nanogram of protein in 15 min was calculated from the slope of the titration curve in the linear range. (This value translates into a turnover number of 29 s−1). The specific activity of F272A-L273A was virtually identical to that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas D279A-D280A was 30% as active as wild-type. The remaining lethal orts Ala-cluster mutants were insoluble when produced in bacteria and thus not amenable to biochemical characterization. The native sizes of the recombinant triphosphatases were investigated by sedimentation through 15–30% glycerol gradients. Marker proteins BSA and cytochrome c were included as internal standards. After centrifugation, the polypeptide compositions of the odd-numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The sedimentation profile for wild-type Cet1(201–549) is shown in Fig.5. The triphosphatase (44 kDa) sedimented as a discrete peak coincident with BSA (68 kDa), consistent with the wild-type enzyme being an asymmetric homodimer (8Lima C. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The triphosphatase activity profile paralleled the distribution of the Cet1 polypeptide (not shown). The sedimentation profiles for the F272A-L273A and D279A-D280A proteins are shown in Fig. 5. Both mutant proteins sedimented at positionsbetween BSA and cytochrome c, suggesting that F272A-L273A and D279A-D280A are monomers. The triphosphatase activity profiles of both mutants paralleled the distributions of the Cet1 polypeptide in the gradient (not shown). Note that the present biochemical evidence that the peptide segment containing Phe272 and/or Leu273 is important for homodimerization of Cet1 consolidates our earlier finding that amino-terminal deletion of Cet1 up to residue 275 results in a catalytically active, monomeric enzyme (7Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The present study establishes the importance of homodimerization for the in vivo function of yeast RNA triphosphatase Cet1 and it highlights the contributions of two separate facets of the dimer interface, both of which play a role in Cet1 function in vivo. We also identify key residues in the hydrophobic core of the Cet1 protomer that stabilize the triphosphatase in vivo. One of the key facets of the interface entails hydrophobic interactions of the side chains of strand β2 of one protomer and strand β3 in the other protomer, of which Cys330 and Val331 appear to be the most critical constituents. This interface also embraces Asp280 (in α1), which engages in a cross-dimer hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Gln329 (in the turn connecting β2 and β3). Two Ala-cluster mutations involving these residues (D279A-D280A and C330A-V331A) elicited lethal phenotypes that could not be suppressed by overexpression of the mutated triphosphatases but were suppressed completely by fusion of the mutated enzymes to the mammalian RNA guanylyltransferase. These results indicated that a disruption of the dimer interface is uniquely deleterious when the yeast RNA triphosphatase must function in concert with the yeast guanylyltransferase Ceg1. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant D279A-D280A protein confirms that its phosphohydrolase activity was intact and that the mutant protein sedimented as a monomer. Thus, we attribute the in vivophenotypes of D279A-D280A to an isolated defect in homodimerization. Although biochemical analysis of C330A-V331A was hampered by insolubility of the recombinant mutant protein, thein vivo phenotypes are consistent with a dimerization defect. Mutations of several other side chains (Pro325, Val326, Ser327, Ser328, Phe332, and Thr333) that make up this segment of the crystallographic dimer interface did not elicit effects on cell growth, implying that their individual contributions are subtle at best. Of course, some these residues also engage in main-chain contacts to the dimer partner, but the significance of these interactions may not be revealed by replacing the side chain with alanine. The second functionally relevant dimer interface involves hydrophobic side-chain interactions between α4 and residues Phe272and Leu273 in the loop preceding α1. Replacement of the Phe272 and Leu273 side chains results in a catalytically active monomeric enzyme that confers a severets growth phenotype when expressed under its native promoter. The growth defect is ameliorated in part by increasing the expression level and suppressed completely by fusion to mouse guanylyltransferase. Alanine mutations of neighboring dimer interface residues Ile268, Asp269, Pro270, and Pro277 did not affect cell growth. However, as noted above, we cannot judge from these results whether or not the main chain contacts of residues 269 and 270 contribute to Cet1 function in vivo. A related issue is whether the growth defect of theF272A-L273A mutant might result from an indirect effect of alanine substitution on the cross-dimer hydrogen bond of the main chain amide of residue 272 (Fig. 3). If this were the case, then we would expect the loss of the hydrogen-bonding partner (the side chain Oδ of Asn526) to phenocopy F272A-L273A. Because the replacement of Asn526 by alanine elicited no phenotype, we surmise that the F272A-L273A phenotypes reflect the contributions of the hydrophobic side chains to the dimer interface rather than those of the main chain. The receiving hydrophobic pocket on the dimer partner for the pre-α1 loop is composed primarily of residues in α4. Although theN525A-N526A cluster mutation of α4 did not affect cell growth, the three other cluster mutants in α4 (L519A-I520A, F523A-L524A, andI529A-I530A) had either lethal or severely conditional phenotypes. To what extent are these mutant phenotypes attributable to defects in homodimerization? The side chains of Ile529 and Ile530 make intimate cross-dimer contacts with Phe272 and Leu273. Note that the conditional in vivophenotypes of I529A-I530A in the various promoter and fusion contexts tested were roughly similar to those ofF272A-L273A, except that I529A-I530A function at 37 °C was not restored by fusion to mouse guanylyltransferase. Although Ile529 does not contact any other residues besides Phe272, Leu273, and Pro277 in the dimer partner, Ile530 makes additional intramolecular contributions to the hydrophobic core of the Cet1 protomer (involving Val493 and Leu495 in β11) that supports the floor of the triphosphate tunnel. The neighboring residues Glu492 and Glu494 of β11 bind the metal cofactor in the active site of Cet1. Thus, we suspect that the I530A mutation imposes conformational effects on the structure of the tunnel in addition to its effects on homodimerization and that the homodimerization problem is overcome in the yeast-mouse chimera whereas the conformational effects on the tunnel are not. This model is consistent with our isolation in a genetic screen of a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant (cet1-1) that contains a single mutation of Ile530 to threonine (7Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, directed mutagenesis of β11 showed that the single alanine mutations of Val493 or Leu495 (the residues contacted intramolecularly by Ile530) resulted per se in ats growth defect at 37 °C (11Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The I470A-I472A (β10) mutant phenotype is also likely to reflect more than one underlying process, including (i) diminished dimerization affinity caused by the alanine substitution for Ile470 (which interacts with Phe272 on the dimer partner) and (ii) intramolecular effects of the I472A mutation on the conformation of β10, which comprises part of the floor and lateral wall of the triphosphate tunnel. Ile472 makes van der Waals contacts with Phe348 and Ile355 in α2, and this helix in turn stabilizes the β strands of the tunnel wall. β10 contains three hydrophilic side chains (Arg269, Asp471, and Thr473) immediately surrounding Ile470 and Ile472, which are essential for the phosphohydrolase activity of Cet1. 3M. Bisaillon and S. Shuman, unpublished. We propose that the L519A-I520A (α4) phenotype,i.e. lethality when expressed by its own promoter and a severe ts growth defect when overexpressed and in the context of the mouse guanylyltransferase fusion, is caused predominantly by intramolecular effects of one or both alanine changes on the stability of the triphosphate tunnel. Leu519 makes van der Waals contacts with Ile497 in β11 in the same protomer. The cross-dimer interaction of Leu519 with Ile268 is probably not relevant to the tsphenotype insofar as alanine substitution for Ile268 was itself without effect. Note that the temperature-sensitivecet1-15 strain isolated previously in a genetic screen contains a single mutation of Leu519 to proline (7Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similarly, the lethal F523A-L524A mutation, which is minimally suppressed even in high copy, is almost certainly caused by effects on active site architecture rather than quaternary structure, because Phe523 and Leu534 are oriented toward the hydrophobic core of the Cet1 protomer and they make no contributions to the crystallographic dimer interface. Rather, Phe523 is situated in a hydrophobic-aromatic-hydrophobic sandwich between Met308 (in β1) and Ile497(in β11) that likely imparts stability to the floor of the tunnel. Finally, the conditional phenotype of D287A-W288A (α1), which was suppressed completely by increasing promoter strength alone, is probably unrelated to effects on dimerization, insofar as neither Asp287 nor Trp288 contributes to the crystallographic dimer interface. However, Trp288 is a key component of the hydrophobic core of the Cet1 protomer. The aromatic Trp288 side-chain stacks on Leu415 (in β7) and makes van der Waals contacts with Ala413 (β7) and Ile428 (β8) that likely stabilize the floor and lateral wall of the triphosphate tunnel. The temperature-sensitivecet1-14 strain isolated previously in a genetic screen contains a single mutation of Trp288 to arginine (7Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although homodimerization in clearly important for Cet1 function in vivo, the rationale for assembly of a dimeric triphosphatase with two parallel tunnels is still not clear. We suspect that mRNA modification in vivo does not require two functional triphosphatase active sites in the same complex, insofar as overexpression in yeast of a catalytically inactive triphosphatase mutant that still homodimerizes and binds to the guanylyltransferase Ceg1 does not elicit a dominant negative phenotype. 4Y. Pei and S. Shuman, unpublished. The mutations characterized here that specifically affect homodimerization would not alter the high affinity guanylyltransferase-binding site on the surface of Cet1. The peptide motif Cet1(232–265) is sufficientper se to bind Ceg1 in solution and to stabilize the guanylyltransferase against thermal inactivation. There are two potential Ceg1-binding sites on the triphosphatase dimer located on opposite sides of the structure. Sedimentation analysis suggests that the dimeric triphosphatase binds 1 molecule of Ceg1 (which is itself a monomer in solution) to form a heterotrimeric capping enzyme complex (7Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The available data do not exclude the possibility that the reconstituted complex is an asymmetrically shaped (Cet1)2-(Ceg1)2 tetramer, and it is conceivable that the dimeric triphosphatase could bind two Ceg1 monomers if Ceg1 were present in excess during the reconstitution. In a strictly heterotrimeric model, it is possible that binding of Ceg1 to one surface of the Cet1·Cet1 dimer sterically precludes binding of a second Ceg1p on the opposite face (7Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that Ceg1 bound to the 232–265 peptide in one protomer of Cet1 makes cross-dimer interactions with the dimer partner that are relevant to cap formation. Perhaps the interaction of the Cet1 dimer with Ceg1 creates a binding site for nascent RNA that permits transit of the 5′ terminus from the triphosphatase active site to the guanylyltransferase active site without complete release of the polynucleotide between the catalytic steps. We anticipate that a crystal structure of yeast triphosphatase bound to yeast guanylyltransferase will provide a definitive account of the stoichiometry of the Cet1·Ceg1 complex and shed some light on the rationale for the distinctive homodimeric structure of the triphosphatase component.

Two isozymes of 5AR, designated types 1 and 2, have been described (1Anderson S. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although 5AR1 is predominantly expressed in skin and liver, 5AR2 is mainly expressed in prostate, seminal vesicles, liver, and epididymis (3Thigpen A.E. Silver R.I. Guileyardo J.M. Casey M.L. McConnell J.D. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Both 5AR1 and 5AR2 are implicated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (2Anderson S. Berman D.M.

Intense efforts made over the past decade to develop drugs against the activity of this enzyme has led to the discovery of potent, time-dependent Δ1-4-azasteroidal inhibitors of 5AR, including finasteride and GG745 (see Fig. 1).Finasteride inhibits both 5AR1 and 5AR2 in a time-dependent manner (5Faller B.

The kinetic mechanism of this time-dependent inhibition is characterized by a fast binding step for the formation of an initial enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI), followed by a time-dependent event leading to the formation of an apparently irreversible enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI*). This time-dependent event involves a chemical transformation at the Δ1 double bond (8Tian G. Chen S. Facchine K.L. Prakash S.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2369-2370Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The finding of a NADP-dihydrofinasteride adduct as a product of this time-dependent inhibition reaction suggests that the chemical event is a combination of a nucleophilic attack of the hydride of the enzyme-bound NADPH on the Δ1 double bond of finasteride and the subsequent capture of the resulting NADP cation by the reduced finasteride (7Bull H.G.

A theoretical analysis of pharmacodynamic effects of time-dependent inhibitors indicates that the in vivo effects of such inhibitors depend upon both the kinetic and thermodynamic potency of the inhibitor (9Tian G.

Sci. 1996; 85: 106-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and provides a theoretical basis for improving the in vivo efficacy of Δ1-4-azasteroids by improving their kinetic potency in the inhibition of 5AR (10Tian G.

Because a smaller K i value would translate into a greaterk 3/K i , the second order rate constant for the time-dependent inhibition, it was reasoned that improving the affinity of Δ1-4-azasteroids for 5AR would enhance the kinetic potency of the inhibitors against 5AR (10Tian G.

Replacing theN-t-butyl substituent at C-17 of finasteride with a much more lipophilic N-(2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl))phenyl group (GG745; see Fig. 1) indeed significantly increased the rate of inhibition of 5AR, supporting the strategy to improve the rate of time-dependent inhibition of 5AR by using ligand binding energies provided at C-17 of Δ1-4-azasteroids (10Tian G. Mook Jr., R.A. Moss M.L. Frye S.V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13453-13459Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,11Frye, S. V., Bramson, H. N., Herman, D. J., Lee, F. W., Sinhababu, A.

In the current study, we synthesized a series of Δ1-4-azasteroids with different C-17 substituents and evaluated the effect of the ligand binding energies of these Δ1-4-azasteroids on the rate of time-dependent inhibition of both 5AR1 and 5AR2. Linear relationships were observed between the binding energies of these compounds and the reduction in the activation energy for the inhibition reaction under second order reaction conditions. The fact that coefficients for these linear relationships were close to unity indicated full realization of the binding energies provided with Δ1-4-azasteroids at C-17 in reducing the energy barrier for the time-dependent inhibition, supporting the notion that systematic optimization of the kinetic potency of Δ1-4-azasteroids by enhancing ligand binding energies is feasible.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe in vivo potency of irreversible, time-dependent inhibitors depends on the kinetic potency of such inhibitors (9Tian G. J. Pharm. Sci. 1996; 85: 106-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One way to improve the kinetic potency of time-dependent inhibitors is to provide the inhibitors with increased ligand binding energies (10Tian G. Mook Jr., R.A. Moss M.L. Frye S.V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13453-13459Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The primary goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between ligand binding energies and the rate of time-dependent inhibition of 5AR by Δ1-4-azasteroids. Understanding such relationships could be helpful in the design of strategies for optimizing the kinetic potency of Δ1-4-azasteroids. Prior to performing such investigations, it is necessary to understand the mechanism of the time-dependent inhibition, which sets the framework upon which the relationships can be investigated.Kinetic Mechanism of Time-dependent Inhibition by 4-Azasteroids Is Two StepsPreviously, the kinetics of time-dependent inhibition of 5AR by finasteride and GG745 were shown to involve two steps (6Tian G. Stuart J.D. Moss M.L. Domanico P.L. Bramson H.N. Patel I.R. Kadwell S.H. Overton L.K. Kost T.A. Mook Jr., R.A. Frye S.V. Batchelor K.W. Wiseman J.S.

To gain further confidence in this two-step mechanism for the structural class of Δ1-4-azasteroids, we evaluated the inhibition kinetics for four additional Δ1-4-azasteroids (1Anderson S. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 2Anderson S. Berman D.M. Jenkins E.P. Russell D.W.

The mechanism of inhibition by all the four Δ1-4-azasteroids showed a two-step kinetic mechanism as judged from the hyperbolic dependence ofkobsd on the inhibitor concentration [I] (data not shown). The kinetic constants obtained by this method are compared with the values obtained previously for finasteride and GG745 in Table I.Table ISummary of kinetic parameters of the time-dependent inhibition of 5AR by Δ1 -4-azasteroids obtained using the method of progress curve analysis at a range of inhibitor concentrations5ARk 3K ik 3/K is−1nmm−1 s−15AR1Finasteride 1-aFrom Ref. 10.

Open table in a new tab Methods to Improve the Rate of Time-dependent InhibitionHaving gained further confidence in the two-step kinetic mechanism of time-dependent inhibition of 5AR by Δ1-4-azasteroids, we then turned our efforts to developing strategies to improve the kinetic potency of Δ1-4-azasteroids. Analogous to enzyme catalysis, time-dependent inhibition reactions may be “catalyzed” by the use of binding energies derived from inhibitor-target interaction (10Tian G. Mook Jr., R.A. Moss M.L. Frye S.V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13453-13459Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). According to the theory developed for understanding the evolution of maximal catalytic effectiveness of enzymes (21Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1977; 16: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Burbaum J.J. Raines R.T. Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9293-9305Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the binding energies an enzyme can provide during reaction may be used to lower the significant reaction energy barriers via three different mechanisms, “uniform binding”, “differential binding,” and “catalysis of an elementary step.” Uniform binding is a mechanism by which the enzyme lowers an energy barrier of the catalyzed reaction by binding the transition and ground states equally well. Differential binding is the ability of enzyme to differentiate between internal states, which although important for enzyme evolution is irrelevant for enhancing the rate of time-dependent inhibition, because there is only one relevant internal state, that of EI, in a two-step mechanism. The catalysis of an elementary step is the reduction of the activation energy for an individual step along the reaction coordinate and requires the enzyme to differentiate between the transition state and the ground state involving that individual step. Comparing enzyme catalysis and time-dependent inhibition, the effects of uniform binding and catalysis of an elementary step in the evolution of enzyme catalytic effectiveness are equivalent to a “K i effect” (Fig.2 B) and a “k 3 effect” (Fig. 2 C), respectively, in the enhancement of the rate of time-dependent inhibition. Obviously, the rate of inhibition can be improved by either lowering the energy barrier for the time-dependent event, a k 3effect, or by enhancing the ligand binding to the ground state, aK i effect. Although the K i effect would produce a linear relationship between the ligand binding energy and the energy barrier for the inhibition, thek 3 effect may not. Chemically, options to produce a k 3 effect by activating the Δ1 double bond are limited, and this double bond activation could also diminish selectivity. Given the understanding that 5AR tolerates bulky groups at C-17 and the structure-activity relationship previously revealed between such groups and the affinity of 6-azasteroids for the enzyme (12Frye S.V.

The rectangular bars represent energies for inhibitor binding or activation energies for conversion of the internal states, EI (A). The energy barrier of k 3/K i may be reduced by a K i effect (B), analogous to uniform binding for optimizing enzyme catalysis by the nature (see “Results and Discussion”) that reduces the transition state and the state of the EI complex equally as indicated by thearrows. The energy barrier ofk 3/K i may also be reduced by a k 3 effect (C), which, analogous to the catalysis of an elementary step in optimization of enzyme catalysis by the nature (see “Results and Discussion”), only reduces the transition state.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Linear Relationships between the Binding Energy of Δ1-4-Azasteroids for 5AR and the Activation Energy of Time-dependent InhibitionAs indicated above, if ligand binding energies have purely a K i effect in the time-dependent inhibition, one would see a linear correlation between the ligand binding energy and the activation energy for the time-dependent reaction. A series of Δ1-4-azasteroids with a diversified set of C-17 substituents were chosen to evaluate the effect of ligand binding energies on the rate of time-dependent inhibition of 5AR. The method of progress curve analysis at a single concentration of inhibitor (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to obtain the constants k 3, K i , andk 3/K i . The values obtained for the inhibition of 5AR1 and 5AR2 are listed in TablesII andIII, respectively. The value of ln(1/K i ), which is proportional to the ligand binding energy, was then plotted against ln(1/(k 3/K i )), which is proportional to the activation energy of the second order rate constant, k 3/K i . A linear relationship between ln(1/K i ) and ln(1/(k 3/K i )) was evident for the inhibition of both 5AR1 and 5AR2 as shown in Figs.3 A and4 A, respectively. The coefficient of the linear correlation was −0.88 ± 0.07 for type 1 5AR and −1.0 ± 0.2 for type 2 5AR. The fact that these coefficients are close to unity suggests a pure K i effect of the ligand binding energies on the activation energy for the time-dependent inhibition reaction.

Given the time-dependent nature of Δ1-4-azasteroids in the inhibition of 5AR and that the binding affinities of these compounds cannot be evaluated precisely by regular, non-time-dependent inhibition kinetics, time-dependent kinetics are needed for determining the binding affinities of Δ1-4-azasteroids for 5AR. However, the time-consuming nature of performing kinetic studies of time-dependent inhibition precludes fast evaluation of the initial binding of Δ1-4-azasteroids to 5AR. Because a large number of 6-azasteroids, which are non-time-dependent inhibitors of 5AR, had been synthesized, one way to circumvent this technical inconvenience is to conduct regular inhibition assays of 6-azasteroids and then predict the ligand binding energies that the C-17 substituents could provide with Δ1-4-azasteroids. This approach requires that the C-17 substituent of non-time-dependent steroids binds 5AR in the same way as does the C-17 substituent of Δ1-4-azasteroids. To evaluate this, the ligand binding energies of a series of Δ1-4-azasteroids and 6-azasteroids that bear the same set of C-17 substituents were compared. The K i values for the Δ1-4-azasteroids (TableIV) were obtained using the method of progress curve analysis at a single concentration of inhibitor, and IC50 values (Table IV) of the 6-azasteroids were obtained using regular inhibition assays. The plots of ln(1/K i ) versus ln(1/IC50) (Fig. 5) indeed indicate a reasonable linear correlation between the binding affinities of the Δ1-4-azasteroids and 6-azasteroids, 2The greater scattering in the values determined for the type 2 5AR may be partly attributed to the time-dependent nature of some 6-azasteroids in the inhibition of type 2 5AR (23Moss M.L.

The results indicated a linear correlation between the ligand binding energy for the formation of the EI complex and the activation energy for the overall inhibition reaction under the second order reaction condition. There was no obvious correlation between the ligand binding energy and the activation energy for the second, time-dependent step of the inhibition reaction. These data are consistent with a model where ligand binding energies provided at C-17 of Δ1-4-azasteroids is fully expressed to lower the activation energy of the overall time-dependent"

These contextual equilibrium effects, which depend upon the composition and location of the flanking sequences, are likely to apply not only to the interaction of A-tracts with single-stranded DNA molecules but also to interactions with drugs and proteins.

Chem. 1988; 263: 1095-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) elicited intensive studies on the factors that affect and modulate DNA conformational transitions. It is well established that the physical chemistry of these transitions is determined by an intricate array of environmental conditions and intrinsic factors, including the ionic strength, relative humidity, pH, and torsional strain. The actual structure exhibited by a given DNA segment is, however, generally considered to be dictated by the particular composition and sequential order of the base pairs within this segment. Indeed, left-handed DNA conformations, cruciforms, intramolecular triplexes, as well as bent or macroscopically curved motifs are detected predominantly in non-random DNA sequences such as alternating purine-pyrimidine segments, direct or inverted repeats, and purine-rich tracts (2Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1095-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated, however, that the kinetics of a conformational change, as well as the features of the resulting DNA structure, may be influenced or even dominated by sequences that are removed from those directly participating in the transition.The first evidence that structural information can be transmitted along the DNA molecule was provided by the observation that the melting of a DNA segment can be strongly affected by the base composition of a contiguous region (3Burd J.F. Wartell R.M. Dodgson J.B. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5109-5113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of cruciform extrusion (4Sullivan K.M. Lilley D.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19435-19442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were found to be dominated by sequences flanking the region that undergoes the transition. The effects were shown to operate over relatively long distances and to be independent of polarity. Right-to-left-handed transitions of alternating d(G-C)n and d(A-T)n segments were also found to be significantly modulated by regions flanking the alternating segment (6Rajagopalan M. Rahmouni A.R. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17294-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Reich Z. Friedman P. Levin-Zaidman S. Minsky A. J. Biol.

A striking demonstration of the long range nature of contextual factors is provided by the crucial role displayed by these factors on DNA packaging processes. The propensity of DNA molecules to condense was shown to be substantially modulated by the presence of non-B-DNA motifs such as Z-DNA or telomeres within the DNA (9Ma C. Sun L. Bloomfield V.A.

Ghirlando R. Minsky A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7828-7836Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Notably, these observations underline the ability of DNA sequences to influence the kinetics of a structural transition that occurs at a removed site. Equilibrium structural effects of DNA context have also been observed, albeit less frequently. Salient examples are provided by structural changes induced by homopurine-homopyrimidine sequences on regions located 3′ to the G tract (13Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Cell. 1985; 43: 199-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), deformations exhibited by left-handed Z-DNA segments when flanked by AT-rich sequences (6Rajagopalan M. Rahmouni A.R. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17294-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the effects exerted by phased adenine tracts on the morphology of condensed DNA structures (14Reich Z. Ghirlando R. Minsky A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1992; 9: 1097-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).To sustain conformational changes and to be affected by contiguous regions, DNA segments must exhibit considerable structural flexibility. In general, DNA sequences comply with this requirement, being supple, flexible, and deformable. A conspicuous exception is provided by runs of successive adenine bases, or A-tracts, which are characterized by an unusual rigidity and hence an exceptional aversion toward conformational changes (15Park H.S. Arnott S. Chandrasekaran R. Millane R.P. Campagnari F. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Nelson H.C. Finch J.T. Luisi B.F. Klug A.

The distinctive structural features of A-tracts and the potential effects of these features upon DNA-protein interactions prompted us to examine the susceptibility of this motif to contextual effects. Toward this end, we have exploited the propensity of poly(dA)·poly(dT) segments to interact with a pyrimidine strand, thus forming intermolecular triple-stranded structures (21Arnott S. Selsing E. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 22Hopkins H.P. Hamilton D.D. Wilson W.D. Zon G. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 6555-6563Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been reported recently that the ability of very short adenine tracts to form a triple-stranded motif is abolished when the A-tract is flanked by GC-rich segments (23Sen A. Graslund A. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 88: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). By using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),1temperature-dependent circular dichroism (CD), and UV melting techniques, we show that the formation and stability of the triplex motif dTm*dAn·dTn (where * designates third-strand binding, and · represents Watson-Crick base pairing) are significantly influenced by sequences that flank the adenine tracts. The nature of the influence depends upon the composition, location, and number of the flanking sequences, at one or both ends of the A-tracts. The results, assigned to long range equilibrium structural modifications within the A-tract, demonstrate that even a particularly robust DNA motif, generally considered to be “immune” to structural deformations, is susceptible to contextual effects in a way that markedly modulates its conformational, and hence chemical, properties. As such, the observations underline the complex interplay between conformational DNA motifs and provide an additional facet to the notion that genetic information might be encoded within DNA structure.RESULTSThermodynamic Effects of Flanking Sequences on the Formation of the Triplex MotifOligonucleotides represent a distinctive class of DNA-binding species that recognize the major groove of the double helix by forming Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds with Watson-Crick base pairs (26Sun J.S.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The process attracted considerable interest because of the potential application of triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) for targeting specific DNA sites both in vitro and in vivo(28Praseuth D. Guieysse A.L. Helene C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 181-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We studied the thermodynamic parameters of triplex formation between a pyrimidine strand and various DNA targets specified in TableI.Table IList of duplex targets used in the studyTarget duplexName5′-A18-3′18–0FE3′-T18-5′5′-CGCA20CGC-3′20–2(CGC)FE3′-GCGT20GCG-5′5′-GCGA20GCG-3′20–2(GCG)FE3′-CGCT20CGC-5′5′-CGCA26CGC-3′26–2(CGC)FE3′-GCGT26GCG-5′5′-A20CGC-3′20–1FE/3′3′-T20GCG-5′5′-CGCA20-3′20–1FE/5′3′-GCGT20-5′5′-TATA20TAT-3′20–2(TAT)FE3′-ATAT20ATA-5′ Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 a depicts a typical isothermal titration profile obtained by 22 5-μl injections of the 18-mer TFO dT18 into the ITC cell containing the double-stranded open-ended DNA target 18–0FE (Table I) at 20 °C. An exothermic heat pulse is detected following each injection, whose magnitude progressively decreases until a plateau, corresponding to the heat of dilution of the single-stranded species in the buffer and indicating saturation, is reached. The heat evolved in each injection was corrected for the heat of dilution, which was determined separately by injecting the single-stranded oligonucleotide into the buffer, and divided by the number of moles injected. The resulting values were plotted as a function of the molar ratio between the single-stranded species and the double-stranded segments and fitted to a sigmoidal curve by using a nonlinear least squares method (25Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). The equilibrium association constant (Ka) and the enthalpy change (ΔH) that characterize the formation of the triple-stranded structure are directly obtained from the titration curve; the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) and the entropy change (ΔS) of the process are then calculated from the equation ΔG = −RTln Ka= ΔH − TΔS.Titration curves obtained from the interaction between the oligonucleotide dT18 and four double-stranded DNA targets, 18–0FE, 20–2(CGC)FE, 20–1FE/3′, and 20–1FE/5′, are shown in Fig.1 b. In all cases, titration reaches half-saturation near the equimolar ratio, indicating a one-to-one binding to form the triplex structures. The thermodynamic parameters derived from the curves are summarized in Table II. Also included in the table are the parameters exhibited by the interaction between dT18 and 20–2(TAT)FE. As previously reported (22Hopkins H.P. Hamilton D.D. Wilson W.D. Zon G. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 6555-6563Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Wilson W.D. Hopkins H.P. Mizan S. Hamilton D.D. Zon G.

Soc. 1996; 118: 4532-4538Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), triplex formation reveals negative ΔS and ΔHvalues, indicating that the process is characterized by an unfavorable entropy change and is, as such, driven by a large negative enthalpy change. Conspicuous differences are, however, observed in the magnitude of the thermodynamic parameters exhibited by the various processes. Specifically, the interaction of the TFO with either 20–2(CGC)FE or 20–2(TAT)FE, which contain flanking sequences at both ends of the A-tract, is associated with significantly smaller enthalpy changes than those exhibited by the interaction between dT18 and the double-stranded DNA target 18–0FE, in which no flanking ends are present. The equilibrium association constants Kafor the formation of the triplexes dT18*20–2(CGC)FE and dT18*20–2(TAT)FE are 54 and 34 times smaller, respectively, than the Ka of dT18*18–0FE formation. Whereas the thermodynamic parameters of triplex formation are found to be sensitive to the presence and base pair composition of the flanking sequences (which are GC- or AT-rich), they are unaffected by their sequential order. Specifically, we find that the formation of dT18*20–2(CGC)FE and of dT18*20–2(GCG)FE (Table I) exhibits identical thermodynamic features.Table IIThermodynamic parameters for triplex formation between dT18 and the target duplexes (specified in Table I) at 20 °C in 20 mm PIPES and 1.0 m KCl obtained from ITC measurementsTriplexKaΔGΔHΔSm−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1cal mol−1 K−1dT18*18–0FE(1.19 ± 0.23) × 108−10.84 ± 0.11−73.8 ± 0.7−214.9 ± 2.0dT18*20–1FE/3′(2.91 ± 0.23) × 107−10.02 ± 0.05−59.4 ± 0.5−168.5 ± 1.5dT18*20–1FE/5′(1.18 ± 0.05) × 107−9.49 ± 0.02−65.0 ± 0.4−189.4 ± 1.3dT18*20–2(CGC)FE(2.19 ± 0.17) × 106−8.51 ± 0.04−56.8 ± 1.6−164.9 ± 5.3dT18*20–2(TAT)FE(3.48 ± 0.55) × 106−8.78 ± 0.09−66.7 ± 2.9−197.7 ± 9.5The concentration of dT18 was 50 μm in the syringe. dT18 was injected 22 times in 5-μl increments into the ITC cell. The concentration of each duplex was 2.5 μmin the cell. The obtained values are the average of multiple experiments. Open table in a new tab Formation of triple-stranded structures containing one flanking sequence at either the 3′ or 5′ end of the A-tract is characterized by ΔH and Ka values that are smaller than those revealed by the interaction between dT18 and 18–0FE but larger than those associated with the formation of dT18*20–2(CGC)FE. Notably, the thermodynamic parameters revealed by the interaction of dT18 with the targets dT18·d(CGCA20CGC) or d(GCGT20GCG)·dA18 (duplexes containing single-stranded, as opposed to double-stranded, flanking ends) are identical to those exhibited by the interaction of dT18with the open-ended double-stranded target 18–0FE (data not shown).Reliance of Isothermal Titration MeasurementsThe accuracy of the ITC measurements critically depends upon a precise identification of all species that are present in the calorimeter cell and of all processes that may occur as titration proceeds. The evaluation of the thermodynamic parameters exhibited by triplex formation can be hampered by the presence of single-stranded DNA species in the ITC cell. These species may result from either dissociation or disproportionation of the double-stranded targets (22Hopkins H.P. Hamilton D.D. Wilson W.D. Zon G. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 6555-6563Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar,31Plum G.E. Biopolymers. 1998; 33: 241-256Google Scholar): 2A + 2B ⇔ 2AB ⇔ A + AB2 (where A and B represent dA18 and dT18, respectively, as well as other single-stranded species that form the duplex targets). The presence of single-stranded DNA molecules may lead to an erroneous interpretation of the ITC results, because the titration curves would represent, in such a case, the sum of both duplex and triplex formation. On the basis of previously reported observations (22Hopkins H.P. Hamilton D.D. Wilson W.D. Zon G. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 6555-6563Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we submit that under the experimental conditions used in the current study, the probability of dissociation or disproportionation processes is low enough to render the concentration of single-stranded species insignificant. It has indeed been shown that for dA19·dT19virtually all dA19 is in the duplex form below 300 K at 1.015 m NaCl (22Hopkins H.P. Hamilton D.D. Wilson W.D. Zon G. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 6555-6563Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Notably, the tendency of double-stranded molecules containing flanking sequences at the 3′ or 5′ end of the A-tract to undergo melting and disproportionation reactions would be even smaller. The absence of single-stranded species is further implied by the observation that the titration of dT18 into the ITC cell containing the various duplex targets results in a monophasic titration curve. The presence of single-stranded molecules would have resulted in the initial formation of double-stranded species. Because the enthalpy change associated with the formation of duplex forms is significantly larger than that exhibited by triplex formation (22Hopkins H.P. Hamilton D.D. Wilson W.D. Zon G. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 6555-6563Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a biphasic titration curve would have been observed.Effects of Flanking Sequences on the Thermal Stability of the Triplex MotifCircular DichroismThe ITC technique was used to obtain the thermodynamic parameters that characterize the formation of various triple-stranded species. We have conducted CD melting studies on preformed triplex forms to assess their relative stability. Because the ellipticities exhibited by double-stranded and triple-stranded DNA motifs are conspicuously different (22Hopkins H.P. Hamilton D.D. Wilson W.D. Zon G. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 6555-6563Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the spectra depicted in Fig.2, a and b provide a direct indication that under experimental conditions similar to those used in the ITC experiments, a mixture of dT18 with either 18–0FE or 20–2(CGC)FE at an equimolar ratio reveals the formation of the triplex forms as predominant products. The CD spectra of the triple-stranded complexes dT18*18–0FE and dT18*20–2(CGC)FE were recorded at different temperatures, ranging between 10 and 50 °C (Fig. 2, c and d, respectively). As temperature increases, both triplex species undergo dissociation, gradually assuming ellipticity features characteristic of the duplex form. The temperature-dependent patterns revealed by the two complexes are, however, markedly different. Whereas the mixture containing dT18 and 18–0FE still exhibits a substantial contribution of a triple-stranded motif at 40 °C, the ellipticities revealed by the mixture of dT18 and 20–2(CGC)FE indicate that already at 30 °C the duplex DNA form predominates and that at 40 °C the triplex is completely dissociated.Figure 2Circular dichroism spectra presented as molar ellipticity (degrees cm−1 M−1)versus wavelength (nm) of (a) 18–0FE (dashed line) and dT18*18–0FE (solid line) at 20 °C; (b) 20–2(CGC)FE (dashed line) and dT18*20–2(CGC)FE (solid line) at 20 °C; (c) dT18*18–0FE at 10 °C (1), 20 °C (2), 30 °C (3), 40 °C (4), and 50 °C (5); and (d) 20–2(CGC)FE at identical temperatures to those of c.

The denaturation profile is biphasic, as clearly indicated by the derivative plot (Fig. 3, inset). The transition occurring at the lower temperature results from the dissociation of the triple-stranded complexes into a duplex and a single-stranded species, whereas the high temperature transition corresponds to the melting of the DNA duplexes. As expected, the 20–2(CGC)FE duplex, which is stabilized by two CG-rich flanking ends, melts into single strands at a higher temperature than that revealed by the corresponding transition of 18–0FE duplex. In sharp contrast, the dissociation of the dT18*20–2(CGC)FE into double- and single-stranded species occurs at a significantly lower temperature (27 °C) than the corresponding transition of dT18*18–0FE (38 °C). Thus, both the CD and UV melting profiles indicate that the thermal stability of dT18*20–2(CGC)FE is substantially lower than that of dT18*18–0FE.Figure 3UV (A260) melting curves of the triple-stranded species dT18*18–0FE (●) and dT18*20–2(CGC)FE (○).

In both cases, the triplex motif melts into double- and single-stranded species at temperatures that are lower than the Tm of dT18*18–0FE and higher than the Tm of dT18*20–2(CGC)FE, in which two flanking ends are present. The position of the flanking sequence relative to the A-tract appears to significantly affect theTm. dT18*20–1FE/5′ undergoes melting transition at a lower temperature than dT18*20–1FE/3′, thus indicating that a flanking sequence located at the 5′ end of the A-tract destabilizes the triplex motif to a higher extent than does that positioned at the 3′ end.Table IIITm values (°C) of the triplex structures (1.6 μm) studied in 20 mm PIPES and 1.0m KCl obtained from UV measurementsDuplex/TFO18–0FE20–1FE/3′20–1FE/5′20–2(CGC)FE26–2(CGC)FE20–2(TAT)FEdT142222151114n.d. 3-an.d., not determined.dT183836322731333-a n.d., not determined. Open table in a new tab To better understand the mechanism by which flanking sequences affect the stability of the triplex motif, we have conducted UV melting studies on triple-stranded structures in which the TFO strand is further removed from the junction between the A-tract and the flanking ends. We find that although the Tm of the triplex dT18*26–2(CGC)FE is higher than that of dT18*20–2(CGC)FE, it is still substantially lower than the temperature at which dissociation of dT18*18–0FE occurs (Table III). To further assess the range of the effects exerted by flanking sequences, melting profiles exhibited by triplex structures derived from the interaction of a shorter TFO, dT14, with the various double-stranded targets were obtained. As expected, the dissociation of triple-stranded structures containing dT14occurs at a substantially lower temperature than that of the corresponding triplex forms with dT18 as TFO (Table III). Yet, although the dT14-containing triplex motifs are located further away from the junction sites between the A-tracts and the flanking sequences than are the dT18 triplexes, the destabilizing effects exerted by these flanking sequences remain. Thus, a decrease of 11 °C is detected in the Tm of both dT18*20–2(CGC)FE and dT14*20–2(CGC)FE relative to dT18*18–0FE and dT14*18–0FE, respectively. Notably, the destabilizing effect of a flanking sequence located at the 5′ end of the A-tract in the dT14 triplexes is substantially larger than that exerted by a 3′ flanking end, as was found to be the case for the dT18-containing triplexes.Tm values exhibited by triplex species containing single-stranded sequences at either one end or two ends of the A-tract (i.e.dT18*d(CGCA20)·dT18 or dT18*d(CGCA20CGC)·dT18) are identical to the Tm of dT18*18–0FE. Notably, the UV melting profiles obtained either by heating or cooling the samples were identical, thus indicating the reversibility of the process.DISCUSSIONAdenine tracts reveal unique structural features that differentiate this motif from all other DNA sequences. Specifically, base pairs within A-tracts are characterized by an unusually large propeller twist, which acts to substantially enhance purine-purine stacking interactions, to stabilize a hydration network along a particularly narrow minor groove, and to enable cross-strand bifurcated hydrogen bonds in the major groove (19Shatzky M. Arbuckle N.D. Eisenstein M. Rabinovich D. Haran T.E. Luisi B.F. Shakked Z. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 595-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Altogether, these particular properties confer upon A-tracts an unusual rigidity that is manifested by the monomorphic structure exhibited by poly(dA)·poly(dT) fibers (15Park H.S. Arnott S. Chandrasekaran R. Millane R.P. Campagnari F. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as well as by the very limited conformational variation that is revealed by A-tracts in different crystalline structures (17DiGabriele A.D. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1024-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). An extensively studied property of adenine runs is their ability to generate a permanent bend in the helical DNA trajectory (32Crothers D.M. Haran T.E. Nadeau J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7093-7096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a structural feature considered to represent an important factor in the regulation of cellular processes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Most of the models suggested to account for A-tract-dependent bends are based on the highly limited deformability of this motif and its unique structure that significantly differs from that revealed by generic B-type DNA segments (19Shatzky M. Arbuckle N.D. Eisenstein M. Rabinovich D. Haran T.E. Luisi B.F. Shakked Z. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 595-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). According to these models, DNA bending results from structural perturbations that are effected by the A-tracts upon flanking sequences that are manifested, in particular, in the junction sites between A-tracts and flanking generic B-DNA segments.The observations reported in this study indicate that A-tracts are capable not only of producing contextual effects on flanking sequences but also of being significantly influenced by such sequences. This influence is manifested by the ability of flanking segments to modulate the interaction between adenine runs and single-stranded DNA molecules. Specifically, the presence of CG- or AT-rich flanking segments located at either one end or both ends of the A-tract is shown by isothermal titration calorimetry to attenuate the association constants of triplex formation, relative to the Ka revealed by the corresponding process involving an open-ended A-tract. Temperature-dependent CD and UV studies complement this observation by demonstrating that the thermal stability of the triplex motif is modulated by sequences that flank the A-tract target.The thermodynamic parameters presented in Table II, along with theTm values summarized in Table III, indicate that the open-ended 18–0FE segment is characterized by structural features that are optimally suited for the interaction with a TFO. This optimal conformation is clearly perturbed by the presence of one conformational junction at either end of the A-tract and even more so by the presence of junctions at both ends. The notion that the conformational perturbation within the A-tract motif is causally related to junctions between this motif and generic B-DNA helices is substantiated by the observation that single-stranded segments, which are located at either one end or two ends of the A-tract but do not form a structural junction, do not affect triplex formation or stability. Results obtained with a long A-tract target (26–2(CGC)FE) and a short TFO (dT14) clearly indicate that the structural perturbation induced by the junctions is not localized but rather transm"
