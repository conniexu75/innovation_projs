https://openalex.org/W2009901571,"The large-scale practical application of fuel cells will be difficult to realize if the expensive platinum-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) cannot be replaced by other efficient, low-cost, and stable electrodes. Here, we report that vertically aligned nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes (VA-NCNTs) can act as a metal-free electrode with a much better electrocatalytic activity, long-term operation stability, and tolerance to crossover effect than platinum for oxygen reduction in alkaline fuel cells. In air-saturated 0.1 molar potassium hydroxide, we observed a steady-state output potential of –80 millivolts and a current density of 4.1 milliamps per square centimeter at –0.22 volts, compared with –85 millivolts and 1.1 milliamps per square centimeter at –0.20 volts for a platinum-carbon electrode. The incorporation of electron-accepting nitrogen atoms in the conjugated nanotube carbon plane appears to impart a relatively high positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms. This effect, coupled with aligning the NCNTs, provides a four-electron pathway for the ORR on VA-NCNTs with a superb performance."

https://openalex.org/W2023425620,"Existing research reports inconsistent findings with regard to the effect of color on cognitive task performances. Some research suggests that blue or green leads to better performances than red; other studies record the opposite. Current work reconciles this discrepancy. We demonstrate that red (versus blue) color induces primarily an avoidance (versus approach) motivation (study 1, n = 69) and that red enhances performance on a detail-oriented task, whereas blue enhances performance on a creative task (studies 2 and 3, n = 208 and 118). Further, we replicate these results in the domains of product design (study 4, n = 42) and persuasive message evaluation (study 5, n = 161) and show that these effects occur outside of individuals' consciousness (study 6, n = 68). We also provide process evidence suggesting that the activation of alternative motivations mediates the effect of color on cognitive task performances."
https://openalex.org/W2054065543,"Morphological diversity within closely related species is an essential aspect of evolution and adaptation. Mutations in the Melanocortin 1 receptor ( Mc1r ) gene contribute to pigmentary diversity in natural populations of fish, birds, and many mammals. However, melanism in the gray wolf, Canis lupus , is caused by a different melanocortin pathway component, the K locus, that encodes a beta-defensin protein that acts as an alternative ligand for Mc1r. We show that the melanistic K locus mutation in North American wolves derives from past hybridization with domestic dogs, has risen to high frequency in forested habitats, and exhibits a molecular signature of positive selection. The same mutation also causes melanism in the coyote, Canis latrans , and in Italian gray wolves, and hence our results demonstrate how traits selected in domesticated species can influence the morphological diversity of their wild relatives."
https://openalex.org/W2018705366,"The glass transition is the freezing of a liquid into a solid state without evident structural order. Although glassy materials are well characterized experimentally, the existence of a phase transition into the glass state remains controversial. Here, we present numerical evidence for the existence of a novel first-order dynamical phase transition in atomistic models of structural glass formers. In contrast to equilibrium phase transitions, which occur in configuration space, this transition occurs in trajectory space, and it is controlled by variables that drive the system out of equilibrium. Coexistence is established between an ergodic phase with finite relaxation time and a nonergodic phase of immobile molecular configurations. Thus, we connect the glass transition to a true phase transition, offering the possibility of a unified picture of glassy phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2094911312,"The design and fabrication of ultrathin polymer layers are of increasing importance because of the rapid development of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Confined, two-dimensional crystallization of polymers presents challenges and opportunities due to the long-chain, covalently bonded nature of the macromolecule. Using an innovative layer-multiplying coextrusion process to obtain assemblies with thousands of polymer nanolayers, we discovered a morphology that emerges as confined polyethylene oxide (PEO) layers are made progressively thinner. When the thickness is confined to 20 nanometers, the PEO crystallizes as single, high-aspect-ratio lamellae that resemble single crystals. Unexpectedly, the crystallization habit imparts two orders of magnitude reduction in the gas permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1999675026,"Recent projections of sea-level rise after a future collapse of theWest Antarctic Ice Sheet (for example, the Fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report) assume that meltwater will spread uniformly (that is, eustatically) across the oceans once marine-based sectors of the West Antarctic are filled. A largely neglected 1977 study predicted that peak values would be 20% higher than the eustatic in the North Pacific and 5 to 10% higher along the U.S. coastline. We show, with use of a state-of-the-art theory, that the sea-level rise in excess of the eustatic value will be two to three times higher than previously predicted for U.S. coastal sites."
https://openalex.org/W1972289308,"A monomeric variant of the red fluorescent protein eqFP611, mRuby, is described. With excitation and emission maxima at 558 nm and 605 nm, respectively, and a large Stokes shift of 47 nm, mRuby appears particularly useful for imaging applications. The protein shows an exceptional resistance to denaturation at pH extremes. Moreover, mRuby is about ten-fold brighter compared to EGFP when being targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. The engineering process of eqFP611 revealed that the C-terminal tail of the protein acts as a natural peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS). Using an mRuby variant carrying the eqFP611-PTS, we discovered that ordered inheritance of peroxisomes is widespread during mitosis of different mammalian cell types. The ordered partitioning is realized by the formation of peroxisome clusters around the poles of the mitotic spindle and ensures that equal numbers of the organelle are inherited by the daughter cells. The unique spectral properties make mRuby the marker of choice for a multitude of cell biological applications. Moreover, the use of mRuby has allowed novel insights in the biology of organelles responsible for severe human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1966010362,"Conservation biologists and community ecologists have increasingly begun to quantify the phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic dispersion in species assemblages. In some instances, the phylogenetic trees used for such analyses are fully bifurcating, but in many cases the phylogenies being used contain unresolved nodes (i.e. polytomies). The lack of phylogenetic resolution in such studies, while certainly not preferred, is likely to continue particularly for those analyzing diverse communities and datasets with hundreds to thousands of taxa. Thus it is imperative that we quantify potential biases and losses of statistical power in studies that use phylogenetic trees that are not completely resolved. The present study is designed to meet both of these goals by quantifying the phylogenetic diversity and dispersion of simulated communities using resolved and gradually ‘unresolved’ phylogenies. The results show that: (i) measures of community phylogenetic diversity and dispersion are generally more sensitive to loss of resolution basally in the phylogeny and less sensitive to loss of resolution terminally; and (ii) the loss of phylogenetic resolution generally causes false negative results rather than false positives."
https://openalex.org/W2002932694,"Completed genome sequences are rapidly increasing for Rickettsia, obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacteria responsible for various human diseases, including epidemic typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In light of phylogeny, the establishment of orthologous groups (OGs) of open reading frames (ORFs) will distinguish the core rickettsial genes and other group specific genes (class 1 OGs or C1OGs) from those distributed indiscriminately throughout the rickettsial tree (class 2 OG or C2OGs).We present 1823 representative (no gene duplications) and 259 non-representative (at least one gene duplication) rickettsial OGs. While the highly reductive (approximately 1.2 MB) Rickettsia genomes range in predicted ORFs from 872 to 1512, a core of 752 OGs was identified, depicting the essential Rickettsia genes. Unsurprisingly, this core lacks many metabolic genes, reflecting the dependence on host resources for growth and survival. Additionally, we bolster our recent reclassification of Rickettsia by identifying OGs that define the AG (ancestral group), TG (typhus group), TRG (transitional group), and SFG (spotted fever group) rickettsiae. OGs for insect-associated species, tick-associated species and species that harbor plasmids were also predicted. Through superimposition of all OGs over robust phylogeny estimation, we discern between C1OGs and C2OGs, the latter depicting genes either decaying from the conserved C1OGs or acquired laterally. Finally, scrutiny of non-representative OGs revealed high levels of split genes versus gene duplications, with both phenomena confounding gene orthology assignment. Interestingly, non-representative OGs, as well as OGs comprised of several gene families typically involved in microbial pathogenicity and/or the acquisition of virulence factors, fall predominantly within C2OG distributions.Collectively, we determined the relative conservation and distribution of 14354 predicted ORFs from 10 rickettsial genomes across robust phylogeny estimation. The data, available at PATRIC (PathoSystems Resource Integration Center), provide novel information for unwinding the intricacies associated with Rickettsia pathogenesis, expanding the range of potential diagnostic, vaccine and therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2032271189,"A major cause for biodiversity may be biodiversity itself. As new species form, they may create new niches for others to exploit, potentially catalyzing a chain reaction of speciation events across trophic levels. We tested for such sequential radiation in the Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) complex, a model for sympatric speciation via host plant shifting. We report that the parasitic wasp Diachasma alloeum (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) has formed new incipient species as a result of specializing on diversifying fly hosts, including the recently derived apple-infesting race of R. pomonella . Furthermore, we show that traits that differentially adapt R. pomonella flies to their host plants have also quickly evolved and serve as ecological barriers to reproduction, isolating the wasps. Speciation therefore cascades as the effects of new niche construction move across trophic levels."
https://openalex.org/W2044340941,"It is increasingly evident that human diseases are not isolated from each other. Understanding how different diseases are related to each other based on the underlying biology could provide new insights into disease etiology, classification, and shared biological mechanisms. We have taken a computational approach to studying disease relationships through 1) systematic identification of disease associated genes by literature mining, 2) associating diseases to biological pathways where disease genes are enriched, and 3) linking diseases together based on shared pathways. We identified 4,195 candidate disease associated genes for 1028 diseases. On average, about 50% of disease associated genes of a disease are statistically mapped to pathways. We generated a disease network which consists of 591 diseases and 6,931 disease relationships. We examined properties of this network and provided examples of novel disease relationships which cannot be readily captured through simple literature search or gene overlap analysis. Our results could potentially provide insights into the design of novel, pathway-guided therapeutic interventions for diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1999425046,"Speciation often involves the evolution of incompatible gene interactions that cause sterility or lethality in hybrids between populations. These so-called hybrid incompatibilities occur between two or more functionally divergent loci. We show that the nucleoporin 160kDa ( Nup160 ) gene of the fruitfly Drosophila simulans is incompatible with one or more factors on the D. melanogaster X chromosome, causing hybrid lethality. Nup160 encodes a nuclear pore complex protein and shows evidence of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, the protein encoded by Nup160 directly interacts with that of another hybrid lethality gene, Nup96 , indicating that at least two lethal hybrid incompatibility genes have evolved as byproducts of divergent coevolution among interacting components of the Drosophila nuclear pore complex."
https://openalex.org/W2158267918,"Polyamines are small organic cations found in all cells, and the biosynthetic pathway is well described in eukaryotes and Escherichia coli. The characterized pathway uses decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine as the aminopropyl group donor to form spermidine from putrescine by the key enzymes S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and spermidine synthase. We report here the in vivo characterization of an alternative polyamine biosynthetic pathway from Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of human cholera. The pathway uses aspartate beta-semialdehyde as the aminopropyl group donor and consists of a fused protein containing l-2,4-diaminobutyrate aminotransferase and l-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase, a carboxynorspermidine dehydrogenase (CANSDH), and a carboxynorspermidine decarboxylase (CANSDC). We show that in V. cholerae, this pathway is required for synthesis of both sym-norspermidine and spermidine. Heterologous expression of the V. cholerae pathway in E. coli results in accumulation of the nonnative polyamines diaminopropane and sym-norspermidine. Genetic deletion of the V. cholerae CANSDC led to accumulation of carboxynorspermidine, whereas deletion of either CANSDC or the putative CANSDH led to loss of sym-norspermidine and spermidine. These results allowed unambiguous identification of the gene encoding CANSDH. Furthermore, deletion of either CANSDH or CANSDC led to a 50-60% reduction in growth rate of planktonic cells and severely reduced biofilm formation, which could be rescued by exogenously supplied sym-norspermidine but not spermidine. The pathway was not required for infectivity in a mouse model of V. cholerae infection. Notably, the alternative polyamine biosynthetic pathway is widespread in bacteria and is likely to play a previously unrecognized role in the biology of these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2017691194,"Background The Neotropical avifauna is more diverse than that of any other biogeographic region, but our understanding of patterns of regional divergence is limited. Critical examination of this issue is currently constrained by the limited genetic information available. This study begins to address this gap by assembling a library of mitochondrial COI sequences, or DNA barcodes, for Argentinian birds and comparing their patterns of genetic diversity to those of North American birds. Methodology and Principal Findings Five hundred Argentinian species were examined, making this the first major examination of DNA barcodes for South American birds. Our results indicate that most southern Neotropical bird species show deep sequence divergence from their nearest-neighbour, corroborating that the high diversity of this fauna is not based on an elevated incidence of young species radiations. Although species ages appear similar in temperate North and South American avifaunas, patterns of regional divergence are more complex in the Neotropics, suggesting that the high diversity of the Neotropical avifauna has been fueled by greater opportunities for regional divergence. Deep genetic splits were observed in at least 21 species, though distribution patterns of these lineages were variable. The lack of shared polymorphisms in species, even in species with less than 0.5M years of reproductive isolation, further suggests that selective sweeps could regularly excise ancestral mitochondrial polymorphisms. Conclusions These findings confirm the efficacy of species delimitation in birds via DNA barcodes, even when tested on a global scale. Further, they demonstrate how large libraries of a standardized gene region provide insight into evolutionary processes."
https://openalex.org/W2116702976,"Background Genome evolution in the gymnosperm lineage of seed plants has given rise to many of the most complex and largest plant genomes, however the elements involved are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Gymny is a previously undescribed retrotransposon family in Pinus that is related to Athila elements in Arabidopsis. Gymny elements are dispersed throughout the modern Pinus genome and occupy a physical space at least the size of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. In contrast to previously described retroelements in Pinus, the Gymny family was amplified or introduced after the divergence of pine and spruce (Picea). If retrotransposon expansions are responsible for genome size differences within the Pinaceae, as they are in angiosperms, then they have yet to be identified. In contrast, molecular divergence of Gymny retrotransposons together with other families of retrotransposons can account for the large genome complexity of pines along with protein-coding genic DNA, as revealed by massively parallel DNA sequence analysis of Cot fractionated genomic DNA. Conclusions/Significance Most of the enormous genome complexity of pines can be explained by divergence of retrotransposons, however the elements responsible for genome size variation are yet to be identified. Genomic resources for Pinus including those reported here should assist in further defining whether and how the roles of retrotransposons differ in the evolution of angiosperm and gymnosperm genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2009242921,"Background To explore clinical heterogeneity of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), viewed as a major obstacle to the interpretation of therapeutic trials Methodology/Principal Findings A retrospective single institution long-term follow-up study was carried out in DMD patients with both complete lack of muscle dystrophin and genotyping. An exploratory series (series 1) was used to assess phenotypic heterogeneity and to identify early criteria predicting future outcome; it included 75 consecutive steroid-free patients, longitudinally evaluated for motor, respiratory, cardiac and cognitive functions (median follow-up: 10.5 yrs). A validation series (series 2) was used to test robustness of the selected predictive criteria; it included 34 more routinely evaluated patients (age>12 yrs). Multivariate analysis of series 1 classified 70/75 patients into 4 clusters with distinctive intellectual and motor outcomes: A (early infantile DMD, 20%): severe intellectual and motor outcomes; B (classical DMD, 28%): intermediate intellectual and poor motor outcome; C (moderate pure motor DMD, 22%): normal intelligence and delayed motor impairment; and D (severe pure motor DMD, 30%): normal intelligence and poor motor outcome. Group A patients had the most severe respiratory and cardiac involvement. Frequency of mutations upstream to exon 30 increased from group A to D, but genotype/phenotype correlations were restricted to cognition (IQ>71: OR 7.7, 95%CI 1.6–20.4, p<0.003). Diagnostic accuracy tests showed that combination of “clinical onset <2 yrs” with “mental retardation” reliably assigned patients to group A (sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.98). Combination of “lower limb MMT score>6 at 8 yrs” with “normal or borderline mental status” reliably assigned patients to group C (sensitivity: 1, specificity: 0.94). These criteria were also predictive of “early infantile DMD” and “moderate pure motor DMD” in series 2. Conclusions/Significance DMD can be divided into 4 sub-phenotypes differing by severity of muscle and brain dysfunction. Simple early criteria can be used to include patients with similar outcomes in future therapeutic trials."
https://openalex.org/W2050601225,"Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, the phytopathogen responsible for citrus canker has a number of protein secretion systems and among them, at least one type V protein secretion system belonging to the two-partner secretion pathway. This system is mainly associated to the translocation of large proteins such as adhesins to the outer membrane of several pathogens. Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri possess a filamentous hemagglutinin-like protein in close vicinity to its putative transporter protein, XacFhaB and XacFhaC, respectively. Expression analysis indicated that XacFhaB was induced in planta during plant-pathogen interaction. By mutation analysis of XacFhaB and XacFhaC genes we determined that XacFhaB is involved in virulence both in epiphytic and wound inoculations, displaying more dispersed and fewer canker lesions. Unexpectedly, the XacFhaC mutant in the transporter protein produced an intermediate virulence phenotype resembling wild type infection, suggesting that XacFhaB could be secreted by another partner different from XacFhaC. Moreover, XacFhaB mutants showed a general lack of adhesion and were affected in leaf surface attachment and biofilm formation. In agreement with the in planta phenotype, adhesin lacking cells moved faster in swarming plates. Since no hyperflagellation phenotype was observed in this bacteria, the faster movement may be attributed to the lack of cell-to-cell aggregation. Moreover, XacFhaB mutants secreted more exopolysaccharide that in turn may facilitate its motility. Our results suggest that this hemagglutinin-like protein is required for tissue colonization being mainly involved in surface attachment and biofilm formation, and that plant tissue attachment and cell-to-cell aggregation are dependent on the coordinated action of adhesin molecules and exopolysaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2062651595,"Background The Escherichia coli heterodimeric HU protein is a small DNA-bending protein associated with the bacterial nucleoid. It can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Cells lacking HU grow very poorly and display many phenotypes. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed the transcription profile of every Escherichia coli gene in the absence of one or both HU subunits. This genome-wide in silico transcriptomic approach, performed in parallel with in vivo genetic experimentation, defined the HU regulon. This large regulon, which comprises 8% of the genome, is composed of four biologically relevant gene classes whose regulation responds to anaerobiosis, acid stress, high osmolarity, and SOS induction. Conclusions/Significance The regulation a large number of genes encoding enzymes involved in energy metabolism and catabolism pathways by HU explains the highly pleiotropic phenotype of HU-deficient cells. The uniform chromosomal distribution of the many operons regulated by HU strongly suggests that the transcriptional and nucleoid architectural functions of HU constitute two aspects of a unique protein-DNA interaction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2031359426,"Hydrothermal ore deposits form when metals, often as sulfides, precipitate in abundance from aqueous solutions in Earth's crust. Much of our knowledge of the fluids involved comes from studies of fluid inclusions trapped in silicates or carbonates that are believed to represent aliquots of the same solutions that precipitated the ores. We used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to test this paradigm by analysis of fluid inclusions in sphalerite from two contrasting zinc-lead ore systems. Metal contents in these inclusions are up to two orders of magnitude greater than those in quartz-hosted inclusions and are much higher than previously thought, suggesting that ore formation is linked to influx of anomalously metal-rich fluids into systems dominated by barren fluids for much of their life."
https://openalex.org/W2028566209,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play essential roles in the activation of innate immune responses against microbial infections. TLRs and downstream adaptor molecules contain a conserved cytoplasmic TIR domain. TIRAP is a TIR domain-containing adaptor protein that recruits the signaling adaptor MyD88 to a subset of TLRs. Many pathogenic microorganisms subvert TLR signaling pathways to suppress host immune responses to benefit their survival and persistence. Brucella encodes a TIR domain-containing protein (TcpB) that inhibits TLR2- and TLR4-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Sequence analysis indicated a moderate level of similarity between TcpB and the TLR adaptor molecule TIRAP. We found that TcpB could efficiently block TIRAP-induced NF-kappaB activation. Subsequent studies revealed that by analogy to TIRAP, TcpB interacts with phosphoinositides through its N-terminal domain and colocalizes with the plasma membrane and components of the cytoskeleton. Our findings suggest that TcpB targets the TIRAP-mediated pathway to subvert TLR signaling. In vivo mouse studies indicated that TcpB-deficient Brucella is defective in systemic spread at the early stages of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2058980325,"Background Genomic imprinting is an exception to Mendelian genetics in that imprinted genes are expressed monoallelically, dependent on parental origin. In mammals, imprinted genes are critical in numerous developmental and physiological processes. Aberrant imprinted gene expression is implicated in several diseases including Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes and cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings To identify novel imprinted genes, transcription profiling was performed on two uniparentally derived cell lines, androgenetic and parthenogenetic primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. A maternally expressed transcript termed Imprinted RNA near Meg3/Gtl2 (Irm) was identified and its expression studied by Northern blotting and whole mounts in situ hybridization. The imprinted region that contains Irm has a parent of origin effect in three mammalian species, including the sheep callipyge locus. In mice and humans, both maternal and paternal uniparental disomies (UPD) cause embryonic growth and musculoskeletal abnormalities, indicating that both alleles likely express essential genes. To catalog all imprinted genes in this chromosomal region, twenty-five mouse mRNAs in a 1.96Mb span were investigated for allele specific expression. Conclusions/Significance Ten imprinted genes were elucidated. The imprinting of three paternally expressed protein coding genes (Dlk1, Peg11, and Dio3) was confirmed. Seven noncoding RNAs (Meg3/Gtl2, Anti-Peg11, Meg8, Irm/“Rian”, AK050713, AK053394, and Meg9/Mirg) are characterized by exclusive maternal expression. Intriguingly, the majority of these noncoding RNA genes contain microRNAs and/or snoRNAs within their introns, as do their human orthologs. Of the 52 identified microRNAs that map to this region, six are predicted to regulate negatively Dlk1, suggesting an additional mechanism for interactions between allelic gene products. Since several previous studies relied heavily on in silico analysis and RT-PCR, our findings from Northerns and cDNA cloning clarify the genomic organization of this region. Our results expand the number of maternally expressed noncoding RNAs whose loss may be responsible for the phenotypes associated with mouse pUPD12 and human pUPD14 syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2075968748,"Protein kinases often recognize their substrates and regulators through docking interactions that occur outside of the active site; these interactions can help us to understand kinase networks, and to target kinases with drugs. During mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, the ability of MAPK kinases (MKKs, or MEKs) to recognize their cognate MAPKs is facilitated by a short docking motif (the D-site) in the MKK N terminus, which binds to a complementary region on the MAPK. MAPKs then recognize many of their targets using the same strategy, because many MAPK substrates also contain D-sites. The extent to which docking contributes to the specificity of MAPK transactions is incompletely understood. Here we characterize the selectivity of the interaction between MKK-derived D-sites and MAPKs by measuring the ability of D-site peptides to inhibit MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of D-site-containing substrates. We find that all MKK D-sites bind better to their cognate MAPKs than they do to non-cognate MAPKs. For instance, the MKK3 D-site peptide, which is a remarkably potent inhibitor of p38α (IC50 < 10 nm), does not inhibit JNK1 or JNK2. Likewise, MAPKs generally bind as well or better to cognate D-sites than to non-cognate D-sites. For instance, JNK1 and JNK2 do not appreciably bind to any D-sites other than their cognate D-sites from MKK4 and MKK7. In general, cognate, within-pathway interactions are preferred about an order of magnitude over non-cognate interactions. However, the selectivity of MAPKs and their cognate MKK-derived D-sites for each other is limited in some cases; in particular, ERK2 is not very selective.

Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). Consequently, there is a considerable interest in targeting protein kinases with drugs (2Cohen P. Nat. Rev.

For both these reasons, it is important to better understand how protein kinases select and recognize their substrates and regulators. Naturally, a key aspect of kinase-substrate recognition is the interaction of the kinase catalytic cleft with the target phosphoacceptor residue (and with adjacent residues). Many kinases, however, augment the limited specificity of this catalytic cleft-target site interaction by also binding to one or more regions of the substrate that are distinct and separate from the target peptide (9Remenyi A.

Rev. 2007; 107: 5065-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Such “docking interactions,” mediated by “docking sites” on kinases and substrates, are thought to tether relatively low specificity catalytic domains to their proper substrates (11Grewal S.

Central to such cascades is an MAPK kinase (MKK, also sometimes called MEK for MAPK/ERK kinase) that phosphorylates and activates a cognate MAPK. The activated MAPK then phosphorylates multiple downstream substrates, including transcriptional regulators. Major MAPK pathways in mammalian cells include the MEK½→ ERK½ pathway, which is typically involved in regulating growth and developmental signaling (19Lawrence M.C. Jivan A. Shao C. Duan L. Goad D.

There are active efforts to develop pharmacological inhibitors of MAPK signaling for use in treating cancer, chronic inflammatory conditions, neurological disorders, and many other diseases (24Kumar S.

Docking interactions are prominent at several steps of MAPK cascade-mediated signaling, including MKK activation of MAPKs and MAPK phosphorylation of substrates (26Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A.

During these transactions, short docking motifs on the MKK or substrate bind to binds to a complementary region on the cognate MAPK (9Remenyi A. Good M.C. Lim W.A. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The ability of an MEK/MKK to recognize its cognate MAPK is highly dependent on docking interactions involving a short motif (the “D-site”) found near the N terminus of MKKs (29Bardwell L. Cook J.G.

D-sites in MKKs reside in a small regulatory domain and are well separated from the much larger, C-terminal MKK catalytic domain. The D-site consensus consists of a cluster of about two or three basic residues, a short spacer, and a hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic submotif (K/R2-3-X1-6-φ-X-φ) (30Bardwell L. Thorner J. Trends Biochem.

The D-sites in several MKKs have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for relatively high affinity MAPK binding (i.e. dissociation constants that are typically in the low micromolar range) (31Bardwell A.J.

Furthermore, preventing docking by mutation, or by blocking with competing D-site peptides, substantially compromises the ability of the MKK to phosphorylate and activate its cognate MAPK(s) (31Bardwell A.J.

Cell. 2005; 20: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The human pathogen Bacillus anthracis has exploited the importance of MKK-MAPK docking: anthrax lethal factor protease severs MKK D-sites from the rest of the MKK polypeptide to disable the immune system during early infection (38Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Turk B.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The above observations clearly demonstrate that MKK-MAPK docking is crucial for efficient signal transmission. However, less is known about the role of MKK-MAPK docking in specificity. MKKs are highly specific enzymes: they phosphorylate only their cognate (same pathway) MAPKs, and they do not target MAPKs in other pathways; for example MEK1/2 do not activate JNK or p38 MAPKs (40Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MKKs phosphorylate a threonine and a tyrosine in a TXY motif found in the MAPK activation loop. In principle, the residues in and around this motif could provide a means for selective recognition. That is (for example), MEK1/2 might recognize the sequence FLTEY in ERK1/2, and MKK3/6 might recognize the sequence EMTGY in p38 MAPKs. However, loop-swap experiments have not supported this hypothesis (41Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 42Jiang Y. Li Z. Schwarz E.M.

Guan K.L. Stein B. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29734-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, active site-target peptide recognition does not appear to play a major role in the specificity of MKK-MAPK transactions. Another attractive possibility is that docking interactions could play a role in selective MKK-MAPK recognition. This mechanism would work best if docking sites were pathway specific. Such a clear-cut solution does exist in the human MEK5-ERK5 MAPK pathway, because these two proteins have been shown to dock using an acidic docking site on the MKK that bears no resemblance to the D-site (44Seyfried J. Wang X. Kharebava G. Tournier C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9820-9828Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, all other human MKK-MAPK docking interactions are mediated by D-sites in MKKs, and, as noted above, D-sites share a core consensus. Thus, the degree to which D-site-mediated docking interactions may provide specificity in mammalian MKK-MAPK transactions is unclear. The fact that D-sites are found in both MKKs and substrates implies that MKKs and substrates may compete for MAPK binding, a prediction that we have verified by using MKK-derived D-site peptides to inhibit MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of D-site containing substrates (for example, the D-site from MEK2 inhibits ERK2-mediated phosphorylation of Elk-1) (36Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have found that this competitive inhibition assay provides a sensitive method for quantifying the binding of a particular D-site peptide to a target MAPK. We have previously used this approach to examine the selectivity of MEK1/2 and MKK4/7 D-sites for ERK1/2 versus JNK1/2 (32Ho D.T. Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. J. Biol.

Here we extend this analysis to include p38, allowing us to compare D-site selectivity between all three pathways and draw general conclusions about the selectivity of docking sites in MAPK kinases. Proteins—Fusions of glutathione S-transferase (GST) to human c-Jun1-89, ATF219-96, and Elk-1307-428 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. GST-MEF2A261-315 and activated human JNK1α1 and JNK2α2 and were purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions/Millipore. Activated mouse ERK2 was purchased from New England Biolabs. Activated human p38α was purchased from BIOMOL International. Peptides—The soluble peptides used in this study were synthesized by United Biochemical Research and by Mimotopes. Peptide sequences are shown in Fig. 2. Protein Kinase Assays—Protein kinase reactions (20 μl) contained kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7. 5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), 1 μm substrate (680 ng of GST-MEF2A, 740 ng of GST-c-Jun, 700 ng of GST-ATF2, or 820 ng of GST-Elk-1), active MAPK (0.9 milliunit (18 ng) of p38, 0.8 milliunit (2.6 ng) of JNK1, 0.8 milliunit (∼5 ng) of JNK2, or 10 units (∼1 ng) of ERK2), 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the indicated concentration of peptide. Reactions were for 20 min at 30 °C. Substrate phosphorylation was quantified by SDS-PAGE (12% gels), followed by analysis of relative incorporation using a PhosphorImager. All data points shown are averages from experiments repeated 3-7 times, with duplicate points in each experiment. We have found IC50 values measure by our protocol to be reproducible within ∼2-fold, even when re-measured several years later using different lots of all components. Specificity of MAPK Kinases—MKKs specifically phosphorylate their cognate MAPKs and do not appreciably phosphorylate MAPKs in other pathways (Fig. 1). For instance, MEK1 and MEK2 phosphorylate ERK (meaning ERK1/2), but not JNK or p38. Likewise, MKK3 and MKK6 phosphorylate p38 but not ERK or JNK (45Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J.

In this study we use the MEF2A and ATF2 transcription factors as model p38α substrates, the c-Jun and ATF2 transcription factors as model JNK1/2 substrates, and the Elk-1 transcription factor as a model ERK2 substrate. All three of these substrates contain D-sites that have been shown to be important in MAPK targeting (26Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem.

We have previously used a “peptide competition assay” to show that D-site peptides derived from MEK1 or MEK2 are able to inhibit ERK2-mediated phosphorylation Elk-1 (36Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). (In addition, these peptides can also inhibit MEK-mediated MAPK phosphorylation and MAPK phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation (36Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). We also showed that D-site peptides derived from MKK4 or MKK7 could inhibit JNK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF2 (32Ho D.T. Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. J. Biol.

These observations indicated that MKK-derived D-site peptides effectively bound to their cognate MAPKs and blocked docking interactions between the MAPK and its transcription factor substrate. These conclusions have been supported by binding assays, by structural studies, and by mutagenesis (31Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol.

However, we have found the peptide competition assay to be the most sensitive and reproducible approach to quantitatively compare the affinity of different D-sites for different MAPKs and have, therefore, used this approach exclusively in this study. The sequences of the peptides used in this study are shown in Fig. 2. p38 Is Potently Inhibited by Cognate D-site peptides—To extend the above observations to the p38 pathway, we asked if D-site peptides derived from one of the three MKKs that can phosphorylate and thereby activate p38, MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6, could bind to p38 and thereby inhibit the ability of p38 to phosphorylate the D-site-containing substrates MEF2A and ATF2 (Fig. 3A). The p38α isoform, the most extensively studied isoform and the most prominent isoform in human cells and tissues, was used in all experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, all three cognate D-site peptides were effective inhibitors of p38α-mediated phosphorylation of both substrates. These results suggest that MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6 compete with transcription factors for binding to the same protein interaction site on p38; indeed, in the case of D-site peptides derived from MKK3 and MEF2A, there are crystallographic data that support this hypothesis (56Chang C.I. Xu B. Akella R. Cobb M. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Of the three D-site peptides, the MKK6 peptide was the least effective, with 50% inhibition (IC50) occurring at a concentration of 20 μm for inhibition of MEF2A phosphorylation (Fig. 3B) and 10 μm for ATF2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). The MKK4 peptide was next in potency, with an IC50 of ∼7 μm with respect to both substrates. These IC50 values in the low micromolar range are comparable to what we have previously observed when testing MEK1/2- and MKK4/7-derived peptides for inhibition of ERK2 and JNK1/2, respectively. Remarkably, the MKK3-derived D-site peptide was a considerably more potent inhibitor of p38α-mediated phosphorylation of either substrate, with an IC50 of <10 nm (Fig. 3D). This degree of inhibition is over 100-fold more potent than we have observed with other D-site peptides. Three peptides were employed as negative controls. These peptides, MKK3EEAA, MKK4EAG, and MKK6EEAA, have substitutions in the key basic and hydrophobic residues of the D-site consensus (see Fig, 2). As expected, none of these negative controls inhibited p38 (Fig. 3). We have previously shown that MKK4EAG also does not inhibit JNK1/2. Specificity of D-site Binding to p38—To begin to explore the selectivity of D-sites for cognate versus non-cognate MAPKs, we have previously asked if the MEK1/2 D-site peptides could inhibit JNK1/2, and if MKK4/7 peptides could inhibit ERK1/2 (32Ho D.T. Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32662-32672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Ho D.T. Bardwell A.J. Grewal S. Iverson C. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13169-13179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of p38α binding to MKK-derived D-site peptides, we compared ability of D-site peptides from MEK1 and MEK2 to inhibit p38α. As shown in Fig. 4, although both the MEK1 and (particularly) MEK2 D-sites were able to weakly inhibit p38α, they were considerable less effective than the cognate D-site from MKK4. Thus, p38α exhibits selectivity for cognate versus non-cognate D-sites. D-sites from MKK3 and MKK6 Do Not Inhibit JNK—We next asked if the MKK3- and MKK6-derived D-site peptides could inhibit the non-cognate MAPKs JNK1 and JNK2. As shown in Fig. 5, neither peptide was effective at inhibiting either JNK1 or JNK2. Indeed, the MKK6 peptide displayed absolutely no inhibitory activity toward JNK1/2, and the MKK3 peptide was only able to weakly inhibit JNK1. This was true whether ATF2 or c-Jun were used as the relevant JNK substrates (data for JNK1/c-Jun and JNK2/ATF2 are not shown but reflected the JNK1/ATF2 and JNK2/c-Jun data shown in Fig. 5). D-site Peptide from MKK4 Inhibits Two Classes of MAPKs—MKK4 protein activates two families of MAPKs: JNK and p38 (45Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

Consistent with the dual function of the full-length kinase, the D-site from MKK4 is an effective inhibitor of both p38α (Fig. 3) and JNK1/2 (Fig. 5). MKK7-D2 Peptide Is Selective for JNK—Although MKK4 activates JNK and p38, MKK7 protein activates only JNK (47Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 48Wu Z. Wu J. Jacinto E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7407-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2044309821,"The G protein coupled receptor rhodopsin contains a pocket within its seven-transmembrane helix (TM) structure, which bears the inactivating 11-cis-retinal bound by a protonated Schiff-base to Lys296 in TM7. Light-induced 11-cis-/all-trans-isomerization leads to the Schiff-base deprotonated active Meta II intermediate. With Meta II decay, the Schiff-base bond is hydrolyzed, all-trans-retinal is released from the pocket, and the apoprotein opsin reloaded with new 11-cis-retinal. The crystal structure of opsin in its active Ops* conformation provides the basis for computational modeling of retinal release and uptake. The ligand-free 7TM bundle of opsin opens into the hydrophobic membrane layer through openings A (between TM1 and 7), and B (between TM5 and 6), respectively. Using skeleton search and molecular docking, we find a continuous channel through the protein that connects these two openings and comprises in its central part the retinal binding pocket. The channel traverses the receptor over a distance of ca. 70 A and is between 11.6 and 3.2 A wide. Both openings are lined with aromatic residues, while the central part is highly polar. Four constrictions within the channel are so narrow that they must stretch to allow passage of the retinal beta-ionone-ring. Constrictions are at openings A and B, respectively, and at Trp265 and Lys296 within the retinal pocket. The lysine enforces a 90 degrees elbow-like kink in the channel which limits retinal passage. With a favorable Lys side chain conformation, 11-cis-retinal can take the turn, whereas passage of the all-trans isomer would require more global conformational changes. We discuss possible scenarios for the uptake of 11-cis- and release of all-trans-retinal. If the uptake gate of 11-cis-retinal is assigned to opening B, all-trans is likely to leave through the same gate. The unidirectional passage proposed previously requires uptake of 11-cis-retinal through A and release of photolyzed all-trans-retinal through B."
https://openalex.org/W2020742460,"Background Protocetidae are middle Eocene (49–37 Ma) archaeocete predators ancestral to later whales. They are found in marine sedimentary rocks, but retain four legs and were not yet fully aquatic. Protocetids have been interpreted as amphibious, feeding in the sea but returning to land to rest. Methodology/Principal Findings Two adult skeletons of a new 2.6 meter long protocetid, Maiacetus inuus, are described from the early middle Eocene Habib Rahi Formation of Pakistan. M. inuus differs from contemporary archaic whales in having a fused mandibular symphysis, distinctive astragalus bones in the ankle, and a less hind-limb dominated postcranial skeleton. One adult skeleton is female and bears the skull and partial skeleton of a single large near-term fetus. The fetal skeleton is positioned for head-first delivery, which typifies land mammals but not extant whales, evidence that birth took place on land. The fetal skeleton has permanent first molars well mineralized, which indicates precocial development at birth. Precocial development, with attendant size and mobility, were as critical for survival of a neonate at the land-sea interface in the Eocene as they are today. The second adult skeleton is the most complete known for a protocetid. The vertebral column, preserved in articulation, has 7 cervicals, 13 thoracics, 6 lumbars, 4 sacrals, and 21 caudals. All four limbs are preserved with hands and feet. This adult is 12% larger in linear dimensions than the female skeleton, on average, has canine teeth that are 20% larger, and is interpreted as male. Moderate sexual dimorphism indicates limited male-male competition during breeding, which in turn suggests little aggregation of food or shelter in the environment inhabited by protocetids. Conclusions/Significance Discovery of a near-term fetus positioned for head-first delivery provides important evidence that early protocetid whales gave birth on land. This is consistent with skeletal morphology enabling Maiacetus to support its weight on land and corroborates previous ideas that protocetids were amphibious. Specimens this complete are virtual ‘Rosetta stones’ providing insight into functional capabilities and life history of extinct animals that cannot be gained any other way."
https://openalex.org/W2009328339,"Background The demand for lactic acid has been increasing considerably because of its use as a monomer for the synthesis of polylactic acid (PLA), which is a promising and environment-friendly alternative to plastics derived from petrochemicals. Optically pure l-lactic acid is essential for polymerization of PLA. The high fermentation cost of l-lactic acid is another limitation for PLA polymers to compete with conventional plastics. Methodology/Principal Findings A Bacillus sp. strain 2–6 for production of l-lactic acid was isolated at 55°C from soil samples. Its thermophilic characteristic made it a good lactic acid producer because optically pure l-lactic acid could be produced by this strain under open condition without sterilization. In 5-liter batch fermentation of Bacillus sp. 2–6, 118.0 g/liter of l-lactic acid with an optical purity of 99.4% was obtained from 121.3 g/liter of glucose. The yield was 97.3% and the average productivity was 4.37 g/liter/h. The maximum l-lactic acid concentration of 182.0 g/liter was obtained from 30-liter fed-batch fermentation with an average productivity of 3.03 g/liter/h and product optical purity of 99.4%. Conclusions/Significance With the newly isolated Bacillus sp. strain 2–6, high concentration of optically pure l-lactic acid could be produced efficiently in open fermentation without sterilization, which would lead to a new cost-effective method for polymer-grade l-lactic acid production from renewable resources."
https://openalex.org/W2066798016,"Great-appendage arthropods, characterized by a highly modified anterior limb, were previously unknown after the Middle Cambrian. One fossil from the Lower Devonian Hunsrück Slate, Germany, extends the stratigraphic range of these arthropods by ∼100 million years. Schinderhannes bartelsi shows an unusual combination of anomalocaridid and euarthropod characters, including a highly specialized swimming appendage. A cladistic analysis indicates that the new taxon is basal to crown-group euarthropods and that the great-appendage arthropods are paraphyletic. This new fossil shows that features of the anomalocaridids, including the multisegmented raptorial appendage and circular plated mouth, persisted long after the initial radiation of the euarthropods."
https://openalex.org/W2029138890,"The long-term effects of mass extinctions on spatial and evolutionary dynamics have been poorly studied. Here we show that the evolutionary consequences of the end-Cretaceous [Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg)] mass extinction persist in present-day biogeography. The geologic ages of genera of living marine bivalves show a significant break from a smooth exponential distribution, corresponding to the K/Pg boundary. The break reflects a permanent increase in origination rates, intermediate between the Mesozoic rate and the post-extinction recovery pulse. This global rate shift is most clearly seen today in tropical bioprovinces and weakens toward the poles. Coupled with the modern geographic distributions of taxa originating before and after the K/Pg boundary, this spatial pattern indicates that tropical origination rates after the K/Pg event have left a permanent mark on the taxonomic and biogeographic structure of the modern biota, despite the complex Cenozoic history of marine environments."
https://openalex.org/W2169339693,"Macquarie Island, a small subantarctic island, is home to rockhopper, royal and king penguins, which are often infested with the globally distributed seabird tick, Ixodes uriae. A flavivirus, an orbivirus, a phlebovirus, and a nairovirus were isolated from these ticks and partial sequences obtained. The flavivirus was nearly identical to Gadgets Gully virus, isolated some 30 year previously, illustrating the remarkable genetic stability of this virus. The nearest relative to the orbivirus (for which we propose the name Sandy Bay virus) was the Scottish Broadhaven virus, and provided only the second available sequences from the Great Island orbivirus serogroup. The phlebovirus (for which we propose the name Catch-me-cave virus) and the previously isolated Precarious Point virus were distinct but related, with both showing homology with the Finnish Uukuniemi virus. These penguin viruses provided the second and third available sequences for the Uukuniemi group of phleboviruses. The nairovirus (for which we propose the name Finch Creek virus) was shown to be related to the North American Tillamook virus, the Asian Hazara virus and Nairobi sheep disease virus. Macquarie Island penguins thus harbour arboviruses from at least four of the seven arbovirus-containing genera, with related viruses often found in the northern hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2004417319,"Male animals of many species deploy conditional reproductive strategies that contain distinct alternative phenotypes. Such facultatively expressed male tactics are assumed to be due to a single developmental threshold mechanism switching between the expression of two alternative phenotypes. However, we discovered a clade of dung beetles that commonly expresses two threshold mechanisms, resulting in three alternative phenotypes (male trimorphism). Once recognized, we found trimorphism in other beetle families that involves different types of male weapons. Evidence that insects assumed to be dimorphic can express three facultative male forms suggests that we need to adjust how we think about animal mating systems and the evolution of conditional strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2038753111,"The aim of this study was to investigate a possible link between cellular telephone use and risks for various diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). We conducted a large nationwide cohort study of 420 095 persons whose first cellular telephone subscription was between 1982 and 1995, who were followed through 2003 for hospital contacts for a diagnosis of a CNS disorder. Standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) were derived by dividing the number of hospital contacts in the cohort by the number expected in the Danish population. The SHRs were increased by 10-20% for migraine and vertigo. No associations were seen for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis or epilepsy in women. SHRs decreased by 30-40% were observed for dementia (Alzheimer disease, vascular and other dementia), Parkinson disease and epilepsy among men. In analyses restricted to subscribers of 10 years or more, the SHRs remained similarly increased for migraine and vertigo and similarly decreased for Alzheimer disease and other dementia and epilepsy (in men); the other SHRs were close to unity. In conclusion, the excesses of migraine and vertigo observed in this first study on cellular telephones and CNS disease deserve further attention. An interplay of a healthy cohort effect and reversed causation bias due to prodromal symptoms impedes detection of a possible association with dementia and Parkinson disease. Identification of the factors that result in a healthy cohort might be of interest for elucidation of the etiology of these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2080236690,"A mutated allele of the essential gene TAH18 was previously identified in our laboratory in a genetic screen for new proteins interacting with the DNA polymerase delta in yeast [1]. The present work shows that Tah18 plays a role in response to oxidative stress. After exposure to lethal doses of H2O2, GFP-Tah18 relocalizes to the mitochondria and controls mitochondria integrity and cell death. Dre2, an essential Fe/S cluster protein and homologue of human anti-apoptotic Ciapin1, was identified as a molecular partner of Tah18 in the absence of stress. Moreover, Ciapin1 is able to replace yeast Dre2 in vivo and physically interacts with Tah18. Our results are in favour of an oxidative stress-induced cell death in yeast that involves mitochondria and is controlled by the newly identified Dre2-Tah18 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1988849263,"Background The Tensin family of intracellular proteins (Tensin1, -2, -3 and -4) are thought to act as links between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton, and thereby mediate signaling for cell shape and motility. Dysregulation of Tensin expression has previously been implicated in human cancer. Here, we have for the first time evaluated the significance of all four Tensins in a study of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as well as probed the biological function of Tensin3. Principal Findings Expression of Tensin2 and Tensin3 at mRNA and protein levels was largely absent in a panel of diverse human cancer cell lines. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed mRNA expression of all four Tensin genes to be significantly downregulated in human kidney tumors (50–100% reduction versus normal kidney cortex; P<0.001). Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of Tensins mostly correlated positively with each other and negatively with tumor grade, but not tumor size. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Tensin3 to be present in the cytoplasm of tubular epithelium in normal human kidney sections, whilst expression was weaker or absent in 41% of kidney tumors. A subset of tumor sections showed a preferential plasma membrane expression of Tensin3, which in clear cell RCC patients was correlated with longer survival. Stable expression of Tensin3 in HEK 293 cells markedly inhibited both cell migration and matrix invasion, a function independent of putative phosphatase activity in Tensin3. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of endogenous Tensin3 in human cancer cells significantly increased their migration. Conclusions Our findings indicate that the Tensins may represent a novel group of metastasis suppressors in the kidney, the loss of which leads to greater tumor cell motility and consequent metastasis. Moreover, tumorigenesis in the human kidney may be facilitated by a general downregulation of Tensins. Therefore, anti-metastatic therapies may benefit from restoring or preserving Tensin expression in primary tumors."

On the contrary, the development of a vaccine against serogroup B, still responsible for a significant percentage of invasive diseases, has been protracted due to the immunologic cross-reactivity of B polysaccharide with human tissues.

Coating the bacterial surface with factor H allows the bacterium to mimic a human tissue and avoid complement-mediated lysis. fHbp is expressed by all the pathogenic strains of N. meningitidis and can be classified in three distinct sequence variants (5Masignani V.

In the present study, we determined the structure of the full-length fHbp by NMR, which improves the knowledge about the distribution of protective epitopes on the protein surface and provides useful indications on the possible localization of the factor H (fH) binding site. Sample Production and NMR Measurements-Recombinant fHbp v.1 (residues Met-7–Gln-255) was expressed in Escherichia coli as already described. Analytical gel filtration analysis showed that the recombinant protein was eluted in fractions corresponding to a monomeric state of the molecule. Electrospray mass ionization-mass spectrometry spectrum indicated a mass of 27281.43 Da, which corresponded to the cloned construct. NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Avance 900, 700, and 500 MHz Bruker spectrometers, all equipped with a triple resonance cryoprobe. The NMR experiments, used for the backbone and the aliphatic side chain resonances assignment recorded on 2H/13C/15N, 13C/15N, and 15N enriched and on unlabeled fHbp samples, are summarized in supplemental Table S1. The 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of fHbp are reported in supplemental Table S2. All the amide protons of the fHbp protein were assigned, with the only exceptions of Val-8, His-26, Gly-202, and Gly-229. The assignment of the aromatic spin systems was performed with two-dimensional NOESY and total correlation spectroscopy maps acquired on the sample dialyzed against deuterated buffer. Backbone dihedral angle constraints were derived from 15N,13C′,13Cα,13Cβ, and Ha chemical shifts, using TALOS (13Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Standard errors of values predicted by TALOS were used as allowed ranges of variations in the dihedral angle constraints. Distance constraints for structure determination were obtained from 15N-edited and 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC. Residual dipolar couplings have been measured in the presence of an external orienting medium constituted by a binary mixture of C12E5 (penta-ethylene glycol dodecyl ether, > 98% purity, Fluka) and neat n-hexanol (puriss., Fluka), which form a stable liquid crystalline phase made of neutral aggregates (called bicelles) in the temperature range from 298 to 312 K (14Ruckert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of C12E5 to n-hexanol was 0.96, and the C12E5/water ratio was 7% weight. One-bond 1H-15N coupling constants were measured at 298 K and 800 MHz by using the inphase anaphase (IPAP) method (15Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn.

Out of them, 73 RDC values, derived from residues not experiencing R1 and/or R2 values outside the average values, were used for structure calculations. 2987 meaningful proton-proton distance restraints (supplemental Fig. S4), together with 158 φ and 158 ψ backbone dihedral angles restraints, were included in structure calculations. The exchangeability of the backbone amide hydrogens with solvent protons was investigated through an 1H-15N HSQC experiment performed on the protein previously extensively dialyzed against deuterated buffer. Hydrogen bond constraints for the slowly deuterium-exchanging amide protons of the β-strands were introduced at later steps of structure calculations. Structure calculations were performed using the program CYANA-2.1 (16Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 278: 353-378Google Scholar). 900 random conformers were annealed in 13,000 steps.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) R2 values were measured using a refocusing time of 450 μs. In all experiments, the water signal was suppressed with the “water flip-back” scheme. Average R1, R2, and 1H-15N NOE values of 0.91 ± 0.04 s–1, 24.2 ± 0.2 s–1, and 0.70 ± 0.03 are found, respectively, at 500 MHz. The experimental relaxation rates were used to map the spectral density function values, J(ωH), J(ωN), J(0) following a procedure available in literature (24Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 25Peng J. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 308-332Google Scholar). The far-UV CD spectrum of fHbp had features characteristic of a folded protein with a high content of β-strands, whereas the negative band at 198 nm, characteristic of random coil conformation, was not present (data not shown). Consistently, the 1H-15N HSQC spectra show well dispersed resonances indicative of an overall well folded protein (supplemental Fig. S1). Heteronuclear relaxation rates, whose values are affected by the dynamic properties of the molecule, were essentially homogeneous along the entire polypeptide sequence, with the exception of residues located at the C and N termini and some loops. The correlation time for the molecule tumbling (τc), as estimated from the R2/R1 ratio, is 20.3 ± 1.5 ns, consistent with the molecular weight of the protein being in the monomeric state. The solution structure of the full-length fHbp consisted of two domains, fHbpN (residues 8–136) and fHbpC (residues 141–255), composed of 10 and 8 antiparallel β-strands, respectively. fHbpN and fHbpC were connected by a five-residue linker and had a topology of secondary structure elements as shown in Fig. 1A, with an overall three-dimensional structure as shown in Fig, 1B. Both domains are structurally well defined, with only few loops showing some conformational disorder (supplemental Fig. S2). From heteronuclear relaxation measurements (supplemental Fig. S3), it appears that most of these loop regions, and in particular, those including residues 85–90 and 118–123 located in the N-terminal domain, have significantly lower heteronuclear NOE values as a consequence of local motions in the ns–ps time scale. Consistently, they were characterized by a very low number of long range 1H-1H NOEs (supplemental Fig. S4), and consequently, their conformation was less defined (supplemental Fig. S2). The fHbpN domain has an elongated barrel-like structure with a length of about 49 Å and a width of 22 Å. It is organized in six antiparallel β-strands of different lengths (β2(45–50), β3(53–58), β5(72–84), β6(87–100), β7(104–111), β8(128–136)), forming an extended β-sheet, and two short β-strands (β1(33–35) and β4(62–64)), which face the β-sheet and a short N-terminal α-helix (16Guntert P.

In 50% of the family conformers, a short β-hairpin, including residues 114–116 (β7′) and 123–125 (β8′), is observed between β7 and β8 (Fig. 1A), whose presence is supported by the chemical shift index analysis. The core of fHbpN is characterized by several hydrophobic interactions that involve aromatic and aliphatic residues. In particular, hydrophobic contacts are present between the residues clustered on one side of the β-sheet (Leu-46, Leu-48 (β2), Ala-53 and Tyr-57 (β3), Phe-76, Phe-78 (β5), Phe-96 and Val-98 (β6), Ala-105 and Phe-109 (β7), Ala-135(β8) and those on the two other β-strands β1 (Leu-34 and Leu-36) and β4 (Leu-63), determining the spatial proximity of the two regions and the overall shape of the N-terminal domain. Further long range interactions between residues Leu-34, Thr-35, and Asp-133 and Ala-135 maintainβ1 close toβ8, stabilizing the overall structure. The three-dimensional arrangement of the β-strands defines a hydrophobic core, which is closed on one side by helix α1. Contacts between some residues located in β3, β4, and β5 and those in helix α1 are present that anchor such a helix to the rest of the protein. The latter interactions define the conformation of a long loop (segment 22–32), which is completely solvent-exposed and rich in charged residues. The latter loop, although stabilized by the contacts of two hydrophobic residues (Leu-24 and Leu-31) with the rest of the protein, experiences high conformational disorder. Also, the region between β5 and β6, opposite to the N-terminal helix, is solvent-exposed despite the fact that it is rich in hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1C). The C-terminal domain fHbpC is constituted by an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel (141–255), whose strands are connected by loops of variable lengths. The same arrangement was previously found in the solution structure of the same domain in the isolated fHbpC domain (12Cantini F. Savino S. Scarselli M. Masignani V. Pizza M. Romagnoli G. Swennen E. Veggi D. Banci L. Rappuoli R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7220-7227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 310-helix present in the solution structure of isolated fHbpC domainis was still present in the majority of 30 of the full-length conformers, although shorter (141–143) with respect to that observed the isolated fHbpC (138–141). Sizable variations for the backbone NH chemical shifts of fHbpC domain in the two constructs (>0.25 ppm as combined chemical shifts) were observed on β7, β8, β9, β14, β15, and β16 (supplemental Fig. S6). The largest differences were observed for residues located in β7, β8, which formed a long disordered tail in the isolated fHbpC domain. The other four β-strands of the C-terminal domain are located on the one side of the β-barrel and define the domain-domain interface. Interestingly, residues located in β9, β14, β15, and β16 formed a hydrophobic patch in fHbpC molecule. The present structure confirms our previous insights on the role of this region of the β-barrel (12Cantini F. Savino S. Scarselli M. Masignani V. Pizza M. Romagnoli G. Swennen E. Veggi D. Banci L. Rappuoli R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7220-7227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The domain-domain interface, formed by about 850 Å2 of buried surface, is stabilized by intermolecular contacts involving exclusively hydrophobic amino acids (Leu-106, Tyr-99, Phe-129, Ile-134, N-terminal domain; Thr-155, Phe-157, Phe-227, Leu-251, C-terminal domain, Fig. 1C). About 70 long range interdomain NOEs were found that defined, together with the RDCs, the reciprocal orientation of the domains. Human complement is the first barrier of innate immunity and kills infectious agents when they try to invade the bloodstream (26Rittirsch D. Flierl M.A. Ward P.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 776-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). To do this, it attacks anything that is not self. Factor H and C4b are complement components that allow the system to distinguish between invasive agents and self-tissues by coating the latter and avoiding the complement attack. During the evolutionary battle for survival, virtually all pathogens have found multiple and redundant ways to escape the complement-mediated killing (27Lambris J.D. Ricklin D. Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). One of the most popular strategies among pathogens is to avoid complement by mimicking host surfaces, covering themselves with factor H. fHbp of N. meningitidis is a typical example of this class of molecules. By binding human factor H, this protein allows the bacterium to survive and grow in human blood and cause a terrible disease. This property, together with the ability to induce in humans a strong antibody response, makes this protein an attractive vaccine antigen able to induce antibodies with a double function: killing the bacterium by direct activation of the classical complement cascade and preventing the formation of fH-fHbp complex on the surface of the bacterium. Based on the knowledge of the complete structure of fHbp, we can identify the location of the variable amino acids (Fig. 2A), the residues involved in binding protective monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2B), the region bound by antibodies against variant 1 (Fig. 2C), the region bound by antibodies against variant 2 (Fig. 2D), and the residues recognized by the antibodies that inhibit factor H binding (Fig. 2E). The variable residues (Fig. 2A) cluster in the upper part of the molecule. This is consistent with a model where the protein is anchored to the bacterial cell wall through the palmitic acid extension of Cys-1 (5Masignani V. Comanducci M. Giuliani M.M. Bambini S.

Accordingly, the amino acids known to be part of epitopes (8Welsch J.A. Rossi R. Comanducci M. Granoff D.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5606-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Giuliani M.M.

Arg-204, Gly-121, and the loop formed by Glu-146 until Arg-149 were identified as involved in the formation of bactericidal v.1 epitopes (8Welsch J.A. Rossi R. Comanducci M. Granoff D.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5606-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Giuliani M.M. Santini L. Brunelli B. Biolchi A. Arico B. Di Marcello F. Cartocci E. Comanducci M. Masignani V. Lozzi L.

Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4232-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Arg-204 is located in the loop between β12 and β13, whereas the segment 146–149 corresponds to the region connecting the two fHbp domains and containing the second short helix α2. Gly-121, which was localized in the disordered region of the isolated fHbpC domain, now occupies the loop between β7′ and β8′ strands. NMR-driven epitope mapping carried out on the isolated fHbpC domain identified Phe-141, Lys-199, Arg-204, Glu-146–Arg-149, Phe-227, Lys-230, and Glu-233 as part of the same epitope recognized by the bactericidal monoclonal antibody Mab502 elicited by fFbp v.1 (10Scarselli M.

Biol. 2008; 386: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The distribution of these residues on the full-length protein supports the hypothesis that the fHbpC domain contains the major part of the native epitope, which consists of all those residues still accessible in the whole fHbp with the exception of Phe-227 and Glu-233, which are now shielded by the presence of the N-terminal domain. Epitopes of v.2 and v.3 have recently been shown to include residues in positions 174, 216, 180, and 192 (11Beernink P.T. Welsch J.A. Bar-Lev M. Koeberling O. Comanducci M. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4232-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although none of the corresponding monoclonal antibodies were bactericidal individually, nevertheless some pairs of them were able to perform meningococcal killing when combined. The same was true for a pair of monoclonal antibodies raised against v.1 (11Beernink P.T. Welsch J.A. Bar-Lev M. Koeberling O. Comanducci M. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4232-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We tried to identify the fHbp regions targeted by these pairs of bactericidal monoclonal antibodies, placing residues recognized by each component at the center of a molecular area of 950 A2, a value chosen as the representative value of the average size for a protein conformational epitope (28Davies D.R.

The interesting observation that the bactericidal epitopes crucial for the killing of v.1 and v.2 are only partially overlapping suggests that it may be possible to engineer molecules containing epitopes of all variant proteins (Fig. 2, C and D). Finally, Fig. 2E shows that the residues recognized by the monoclonal antibodies that inhibit factor H binding (11Beernink P.T. Welsch J.A. Bar-Lev M. Koeberling O. Comanducci M. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4232-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) are located In the upper part of both in the N-terminal and in the C-terminal part of the molecule, suggesting that this region is involved in the interaction with factor H. In conclusion, the complete structure of fHpb allowed us to map residues involved in important functions, such as binding to factor H and eliciting bactericidal antibodies, and provides the basis to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the function of this important molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2073022188,"Several regulators of endocytic trafficking have recently been identified as tumour suppressors in Drosophila. These include components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. Disruption of subunits of ESCRT-I and –II leads to cell-autonomous endosomal accumulation of ubiquitinated receptors, loss of apicobasal polarity and epithelial integrity, and increased cell death. Here we report that disruption of the ATPase dVps4, the most downstream component of the ESCRT machinery, causes the same array of cellular phenotypes. We find that loss of epithelial integrity and increased apoptosis, but not loss of cell polarity, require the activation of JNK signalling. Abrogation of JNK signalling prevents apoptosis in dVps4 deficient cells. Indeed double deficiency in dVps4 and JNK signalling leads to the formation of neoplastic tumours. We conclude that dvps4 is a tumour suppressor in Drosophila and that JNK is central to the cell-autonomous phenotypes of ESCRT-deficient cells."

However, the accuracy of such tests will be limited by knowledge of the distance and relative motion of the system. Here we present very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations which reveal that the distance to PSR J0737-3039A/B is 1150(-160)(+220) parsecs, more than double previous estimates, and confirm its low transverse velocity ( approximately 9 kilometers per second). Combined with a decade of pulsar timing, these results will allow tests of gravitational radiation emission theories at the 0.01% uncertainty level, putting stringent constraints on theories that predict dipolar gravitational radiation. They also allow insight into the system's formation and the source of its high-energy emission."

Targeting C3b, a component central to the alternative pathway of complement, provides a powerful approach to inhibit complement-mediated immune responses and tissue injury. In the present study, phage display technology was employed to generate an antibody that selectively recognizes C3b but not the non-activated molecule C3. The crystal structure of C3b in complex with a Fab fragment of this antibody (S77) illustrates the structural basis for this selectivity. Cleavage of C3 to C3b results in a plethora of structural changes within C3, including the rearrangement of macroglobulin domain 6 enabling binding of S77 to the adjacent macroglobulin domain 7 domain. S77 blocks binding of factor B to C3b inhibiting the first step in the formation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase. In addition, S77 inhibits C5 binding to C3b. This results in significantly reduced formations of anaphylatoxins and membrane-attack complexes.

Biotechnol... 2007; 25: 1265-1275Google Scholar). A first step in the AP of complement activation is the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b then binds pro-enzyme factor B (fB) and properdin (P) to form the C3 convertase responsible for subsequent cleavage of the substrates C3 and C5 (3Muller-Eberhard H.J. Gotze O. J. Exp. Med... 1972; 135: 1003-1008Google Scholar). In addition to acting as the noncatalytic subunit of the protease fB, C3b serves as the binding partner for several complement regulators and receptors, including complement factor H (fH) and complement receptor 1 (CR1).Our understanding of complement activation at the structural levels has been greatly advanced with solving the structures of the central complement component C3, the first cleavage product C3b and second product C3c (4Janssen B.J. Christodoulidou A. McCarthy A. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Nature.. 2006; 444: 213-216Google Scholar, 5Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P.

Nature.. 2006; 444: 217-220Google Scholar). The cleavage of C3 to C3b, the first step in activation of the alternative complement pathway, is accompanied by large conformational changes. These changes result in the exposure of new surfaces required for convertase assembly and regulation (7Gros P. Milder F.J. Janssen B.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol... 2008; 8: 48-58Google Scholar). Most importantly, C3b serves as the binding partner for fB that, upon cleavage by factor D (fD), forms the catalytic subunit of the AP convertase.Because levels and turnover of C3 in serum are high (8Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med... 2001; 344: 1058-1066Google Scholar) reagents that target systemic C3 require high dosing to establish therapeutically relevant concentrations in the circulation. In the present study, phage-display technology was employed to generate S77, an antibody that selectively binds C3 activation products but not native C3, targeting only a small portion (0.5%) of total C3 proteins present in serum. To further define the structural basis for this selectivity, we solved the crystal structure of S77 in complex with C3b at 3.1-Å resolution. Because epitopes exposed after the first C3 cleavage step also serve as binding sites for complement receptors and modulators, we further determined if S77 inhibits binding of complement regulators fH and CR1 to C3b and whether S77 interferes with the formation of the complement convertase. Together, we demonstrate the utility of phage display technology to generate a C3b-specific antibody and further elucidate the molecular basis by which this antibody interferes with AP complement activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll complement proteins were obtained from CompTech except C3 and its fragments.

The reaction was diluted with a 0.05× volume of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA and loaded onto a Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in the same buffer. Protein was eluted with a 0.0 to 0.5 m NaCl gradient. The Identity of C3c and iC3b fragments was confirmed by Edman degradation.

Nunc 96-well Maxi-Sorp immunoplates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with C3b (10 μg/ml) and blocked for 1 h with PT buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. The antibody phage libraries were added and incubated overnight. The plates were washed with PT buffer, and bound phage were eluted with 50 mm HCl and 500 mm NaCl for 30 min and neutralized with an equal volume of 1 m Tris base. Recovered phages were amplified in E. coli XL-1 blue cells. During subsequent selection rounds, the amplified antibody phage were preincubated with 500 nm C3 before being added to antigen-coated plates to counter-select against phage antibodies that could also bind human C3. The binding time of antibody-antigen was reduced to 2–3 h, and the stringency of plate washing was gradually increased (11Liang W.C. Dennis M.S. Stawicki S. Chanthery Y. Pan Q. Chen Y. Eigenbrot C.

The phage antibodies that specifically bound to C3b but not C3 were reformatted to full-length IgGs by cloning VL and VH regions of individual clones into LPG3 and LPG4 vectors, respectively (13Carter P. Presta L. Gorman C.M. Ridgway J.B. Henner D. Wong W.L. Rowland A.M. Kotts C. Carver M.E. Shepard H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 4285-4289Google Scholar). Antibodies were transiently expressed in mammalian cells and purified with protein A columns. Methods for affinity maturation of the candidate antibody, measuring binding specificity by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and affinity determination of the antibody by surface plasmon resonance are described in the supplemental materials.Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Crystals of the C3b-S77 complex were obtained within a week at 19 °C from 4-μl hanging drops, consisting of a 1:1 ratio of protein solution (10 mg/ml protein in 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8) to mother liquor (10% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m MgCl2, 100 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.0), suspended over mother liquor. Crystals were harvested, briefly placed in a solution containing 20% glycerol, 10% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m Na-HEPES, pH 7.0, and then flash frozen in liquid N2. Diffraction data were collected at Advanced Light Source beamline 5.0.2 and processed using HKL2000 (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol... 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). Crystals of the C3b-S77 complex diffracted to 3.1-Å resolution, belonged to space group C2 with cell parameters of a = 216.4 Å, b = 180.4 Å, c = 154.6 Å, and β = 115.73°. Crystals contained two complexes each composed of one C3b molecule bound to one S77 fragment in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the coordinates of C3b from the C3b-CRIg complex (pdb code 2ICE) using the program Phaser. Refinement using Refmac (15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A.

With the exception of the CUB and the C345C domains, all domains were well defined in the electron density.Methods for detecting fB, fH, and CR1 binding to C3b, decay acceleration assays, fH and CR1 co-factor activity for fI-mediated proteolytic cleavage of C3b, convertase assays, and the C5 binding assay are described in the supplemental materials.C5 Convertase Assay—C5 convertase was assembled on zymosan particles (CompTech) as described previously (17Rawal N. Pangburn M.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 16828-16835Google Scholar) with modification described in the supplemental materials.RESULTSGeneration of a Phage Antibody Selective for Cleavage Products of C3—To identify antibodies that distinguish C3 and C3b, a protocol was designed that employed subtractive phage panning to counter-select phage antibodies that bind to C3. Phage that bound C3b were identified, the Fab sequences were grafted onto the human IgG1 framework of herceptin (18Wu Y. Eigenbrot C. Liang W.C. Stawicki S. Shia S. Fan B. Ganesan R. Lipari M.T. Kirchhofer D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 19784-19789Google Scholar), and the sequences were expressed in mammalian cells. Antibody YW144.2.45 IgG was selected out of a panel of 15 clones based on its binding affinity (KD = 160 nm measured by surface plasmon resonance; results not shown) and its selectivity for C3b but not to C3.To further improve its affinity, YW144.2.45 was affinity-matured using three different complementarity determining region (CDR) combinatorial libraries. Selected amino acids in the CDRs 1, 2, and 3 of both the light chain and the heavy chain (see supplemental Fig. S1) were randomized, and a high stringency selection process was applied to improve the on- and off-rate of the antibody. After six rounds of sorting, phage antibodies that bound specifically to C3b and that displayed higher affinity compared with parental clones were reformatted to full-length IgGs. Out of eight antibodies, YW144.2.45.S77 (hereafter referred to as S77 IgG), had the highest affinity as measured by surface plasmon resonance (results not shown) and was selected for further analysis. S77 IgG contained seven amino acid changes (supplemental Fig. S1) in the CDRs of the heavy chain and two changes in CDR L3 of the light chain and had a 10-fold higher affinity when compared with the parent antibody. Furthermore, S77 IgG bound C3b but not C3 as shown by ELISA (Fig. 1, A and B). Residual binding to C3 at higher concentrations of S77 IgG most likely resulted from partial hydrolysis of C3 when exposed to water. Surface plasmon resonance studies using S77 (the Fab fragment of the antibody) further confirmed binding of S77 to C3b, hydrolyzed C3 (iC3), iC3b, and C3c with affinities ranging from 1.2 to 2.2 nm (Fig. 1C). S77 did not bind to C3dg (results not shown). In line with the selective recognition of C3b, iC3b, and C3c but not C3 by S77, the antibody detected only a small fraction (0.5%) of the total C3 proteins present in human serum (Fig. 1D).Crystal Structure of S77 in Complex with C3b Indicates Why S77 Recognizes C3b and Not C3—To determine the structural basis for S77's selective recognition of C3b and not C3, the structure of S77 in complex with C3b was solved at 3.1-Å resolution. Crystals contained two complexes, each composed of one C3b molecule and one Fab fragment, in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2A). Both complexes superimposed well onto each other with minor conformational changes in the C1r/C1s, Uegf, and bone morphogenetic protein-1 (CUB), thioester bond-containing domain (TED), and the C-terminal C345C domain. Similarly, C3b in complex with S77 also superimposed well onto the C3b-CRIg complex (pdb 2ICF) with 574 Cα positions of the β-chain superimposing with <0.8 Å r.m.s.d. and 824 Cα positions of the α-chain superimposing with <3 Å r.m.s.d. This indicates that C3b, with the exception of the C345C domain, and to a lesser extent the CUB and TED domains are very rigid. The interface between C3b and the Fab buries a total of ∼1930 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface. The Fab contacts residues from the α′NT (∼50 Å2), the MG6 domain (∼140 Å2), and the MG7 domain (∼830 Å2) of C3b (Fig. 2). The bulk of these interactions is mediated by the heavy chain CDR-H1 (∼210Å2), CDR-H2 (∼180 Å2), and CDR-H3 (360 Å2) with additional contributions from the light-chain CDRs (∼150 Å2). In addition to a number of hydrophilic interactions, a few hydrophobic interactions exist; most notably Phe-898 that protrudes from the surface of C3b binding into a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues from CDR-H3 and CDR-L2 of the Fab (Fig. 2B). Comparison of C3b-Fab complex with structures of C3b in its unbound form (pdb code: 2I07) or bound to CRIg (pdb code: 2ICF) reveals that minimal conformational changes are required in C3b to allow binding to the Fab, with the largest difference occurring at the position of the Phe-898 side chain. S77 recognizes an epitope that is present on the primary sequence level in C3, the un-activated molecule, as well as in C3b or C3c, yet it selectively binds C3b and C3c. Comparison of C3 and C3b structures reveal the underlying basis for this selectivity: whereas the overall domain structure of both the MG6 and the MG7 domains is very similar in C3b and C3 (r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å for 97 Cα positions in MG6 and r.m.s.d. 0.65 for 101 Cα positions in MG6), the orientation of these domains with respect to each other is quite different in these molecules. The rotation of MG6 with respect to MG7 of ∼15° (4Janssen B.J. Christodoulidou A. McCarthy A. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Nature.. 2006; 444: 213-216Google Scholar) occurring during C3 activation, allows the Fab to recognize an epitope formed by both domains. Superimposition of the MG7 domain of the C3b-Fab complex onto the MG7 domain of C3 shows that numerous steric clashes of the Fab and the MG6 domain within C3 prevent the Fab from binding to C3 (Fig. 2, C and D). In this respect binding of S77 to C3b or C3c is analogous to binding of CRIg, which also recognizes a binding epitope that is formed only after conformational changes occur during C3 activation (i.e. conversion to either iC3 or C3b).FIGURE 2Crystal structure of S77 in complex with C3b. A, structure of the C3b-S77 dimer in the asymmetric unit. One C3b-S77 complex is shown as a ribbon diagram; the other is in surface representation. The β-chains of C3b are depicted in green, the α-chains shown in violet, light blue (TED domain), and orange (CUB domain). S77 is shown with the light chains colored white, and the heavy chains colored yellow. B, the Fab surface is shown with the light chain atoms in white and heavy chain in yellow. All amino acids that have at least one atom closer than 4.5 Å to the S77 are shown in stick representation and are labeled with carbon atoms of residues from the β-chain and α-chain colored green and violet, respectively. C, the S77 binding site of C3b. Atoms of C3b that are closer than 4.5, 4, and 3.5 Å are colored yellow, orange, and red, respectively. D, the surface of C3 is shown after superimposing the MG7 domain of C3 onto the MG7 domain of the C3b-S77 complex. Although the MG7 domains of C3 and C3b superimpose very well (r.m.s.d. 0.5 Å for 97 common Cα positions), the different relative orientation of MG7 in respect to MG6 leads to steric clashes between the light chain of the S77 and the MG6 domain in a potential complex, thus preventing S77 binding to C3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)S77 Inhibits fH and CR1 Binding to C3b and Factor I-mediated Cofactor Activity—After cleavage, C3 undergoes large conformational changes that result in the exposure of new surfaces that form binding sites for various complement receptors and regulators. Binding sites for fH and CR1 (19Oran A.E. Isenman D.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 5120-5130Google Scholar) are located within residues 727–768 of the α′NT and MG6 domain of C3b, a region that also harbors binding sites for fB (20Becherer J.D. Alsenz J. Esparza I. Hack C.E. Lambris J.D. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 1787-1794Google Scholar, 21Lambris J.D. Lao Z. Oglesby T.J. Atkinson J.P. Hack C.E. Becherer J.D. J.

S77 inhibited fH binding to C3b by ELISA (Fig. 3A) and fH cofactor activity for factor I (fI)-mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b in a fluid-phase cofactor assay (Fig. 3B). S77 also inhibited CR1 binding to C3b (Fig. 3C) and sCR1-mediated fI cofactor activity (Fig. 3D). Because S77 binding sites on C3b do not overlap with the binding sites of CR1 and fH on C3b (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B), the Fab fragment likely prevents access of fH, CR1, and factor B to these residues via steric clashes. Thus, S77 binds to a site on C3b that is important for fH and CR1 functional activity.FIGURE 3S77 inhibits fH and sCR1 binding to C3 and inhibits fH and sCR1 co-factor activity. A, microtiter plates were coated with C3b, and fH was added in the presence of increasing concentrations of S77 or control Fab. Binding of fH to C3b was determined using an anti-fH antibody and a secondary HRPO-conjugated antibody. Absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 450 nm. B, cofactor activity for fI-mediated cleavage of C3b was measured by incubating C3b and fI with fH or increasing concentrations of S77 or control Fab. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and the samples were analyzed by gel-electrophoresis and Simply Blue staining. C, S77 inhibits CR1 binding to C3b. Microtiter plates coated with C3b were incubated with sCR1 and increasing concentrations of S77 or control Fab. Binding of sCR1 to C3b was detected with an anti-CR1 primary antibody and an HRPO-conjugated secondary antibody.

Data in A and C are expressed as mean ± S.D. of four repeats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Formation, but Not the Stability, of the Alternative Pathway C3 Convertase Is Inhibited by S77—Because C3b is a central subunit of both the C3 and C5 convertases of the alternative pathway we further determined whether S77 binding to C3b could inhibit the activity of both convertases. The first step in the generation of C3 convertase is binding of factor B to iC3 or C3b, after which exposure of a scissile bond allows factor D-mediated cleavage of factor B to form the proteolytic active serine protease C3bBb (22Milder F.J. Gomes L. Schouten A. Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Romijn R.A. Hemrika W. Roos A. Daha M.R. Gros P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol... 2007; 14: 224-228Google Scholar). S77 inhibited binding of factor B to C3b (Fig. 4A) and consequently prevented the formation of C3 convertase (Fig. 4B). Unlike CR1, S77 did not decay the C3 convertase (Fig. 4C) nor did S77 interfere with P binding (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, S77 inhibits the formation, but not the stability, of the alternative pathway convertase.FIGURE 4S77 affects the formation, but not stability, of the alternative pathway C3 convertase. A, S77 inhibits binding of factor B to C3b. C3b was coated on microtiter plates. S77 or control Fab was added, followed by addition of factor B. Binding of factor B to C3b was determined with anti-factor B antibody and secondary antibodies conjugated to HRPO. B, S77 Fab inhibits formation of C3 convertase. C3b was coated on microtiter plates. S77 or control Fab was added, followed by addition of fB and factor D. Binding of fBb to C3b was determined with anti-fB antibody and secondary antibody conjugated to HRPO. C, S77 does not decay the C3 convertase. Microtiter plates were coated with C3b, incubated with factor B and factor D followed by the addition of S77, sCR1 or control Fab. Factor Bb was detected with goat anti-human factor B and donkey anti-goat antibody conjugated to HRPO. Absorbance of the reaction product was read at 450 nm.

Generation of C3a des-Arg (Fig. 5A) and C3b (Fig. 5B) was inhibited by S77, confirming that S77 prevents formation of the active C3-convertase. Because S77 also recognizes iC3, S77 may additionally inhibit factor B binding to iC3, preventing formation of the initial fluid-phase C3 convertase of the AP (23Pangburn M.K. Schreiber R.D. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med... 1981; 154: 856-867Google Scholar).FIGURE 5S77 inhibits the alternative pathway C3 and C5 convertase. A, C3 and factors B and D were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of S77 or control Fab. The concentration of C3a des-Arg reaction product was determined by ELISA. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements. B, in a separate experiment, the effect of S77 or control Fab on C3 convertase activity was determined by gel electrophoresis. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results. C, S77 inhibits C5 convertase activity. C5 convertase was assembled on the surface of zymosan particles. A fixed concentration of C5 and convertase was mixed with increasing concentrations of S77 or control Fab. Convertase activity was determined using a chicken erythrocyte hemolytic assay and expressed as percentage of hemolysis in the absence of inhibitor. D, C3b was coated on microtiter plates and incubated with a mixture of C5 and increasing concentrations of S77 or control Fab. C5 bound to plate-coated C3b was detected with a polyclonal antibody against C5 and a HRPO-conjugated secondary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)At the next level of complement activation, C3b dimers constitute the noncatalytic subunit of the C5 convertase with two potential binding sites for S77. To determine if S77 could block C5 convertase in addition to C3 convertase activity, a C5 convertase was generated by assembling C3b subunits on the surface of zymosan particles. The presence of S77 prevented cleavage of the substrate C5 into C5a and C5b. Together, these results indicate that S77 inhibited the alternative pathway at the level of both the C3 and C5 convertases (Fig. 5C). To be cleaved by the complement convertases, C5 needs to bind to the C3b subunit of the C5 convertase. S77 inhibited binding of C5 to C3b multimers in an ELISA-based assay (Fig. 5D). Thus, in addition to interfering with the binding of fB to C3b, S77 inhibited C5 binding to C3b, a step required for C5 proteolytic activation and formation of C5a and the membrane attack complex.S77 Inhibits the Alternative, but Not Classical Pathway of Complement Activation in Human Serum—Both, the AP and classical pathway (CP) C5 convertases contain at least one C3b molecule that could potentially serve as a binding partner for S77. Therefore, we next determined if S77 could block terminal C5 cleavage and membrane attack complex formation mediated by the AP or CP convertases. S77 inhibited hemolytic activity in C1q-depleted serum (Fig. 6A) but did not inhibit the CP of complement in fB-depleted human serum (Fig. 6B) indicating that S77 is a selective inhibitor of the AP convertases.FIGURE 6S77 inhibits the alternative, but not classical, pathway C5 convertase in human serum. A, S77 inhibits AP-mediated hemolysis. Rabbit erythrocytes were incubated with C1q-depleted human serum in the presence of increasing concentrations of S77 or control Fab. Hemolysis was determined by absorbance of the supernatant at 412 nm. Convertase activation was expressed as percentage of hemolysis in the absence of inhibitor. B, S77 does not inhibit CP convertase activation. IgM-coated sheep erythrocytes were incubated with factor B-depleted human serum and increasing concentrations of S77 or anti-C5 antibody. C, S77 lacks complement inhibitory activity in rhesus serum where His-897 is substituted by Phe-897. CRIg-Fc was used as a positive control. D, His-897 of C3b is within hydrogen bonding distance to the main-chain atoms of the heavy chain CDR1 and CDR3 of S77. The exchange of His-897 against phenylalanine, the respective amino acid in the C3 sequence of rhesus, leads to the loss of these hydrophilic interactions. Data in A–C are expressed as mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)While testing species cross-reactivity of the Fab, we observed the absence of blocking potential in serum from baboon, cynomologus, and rhesus monkey (results not shown). To further elucidate the basis for lack of species cross-reactivity, we sequenced the stretch of rhesus C3b that encompasses the S77 binding site. Importantly, His-897 in human C3b is replaced by the more hydrophobic Phe in C3b from rhesus (supplemental Fig. S2A). This specificity of the Fab toward human C3b has a clear structural rationale. His-897, located in the center of the interface between C3b and the Fab, is ideally positioned to form two hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl of Ser-31 of CDR-H1 and the main-chain nitrogen of Leu-97 in CDR-H3 (Fig. 6D).

https://openalex.org/W2091956052,"ERp57 is a thiol oxidoreductase that catalyzes disulfide formation in heavy chains of class I histocompatibility molecules. It also forms a mixed disulfide with tapasin within the class I peptide loading complex, stabilizing the complex and promoting efficient binding of peptides to class I molecules. Since ERp57 associates with the lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin, it is thought that ERp57 requires these chaperones to gain access to its substrates. To test this idea, we examined class I biogenesis in cells lacking calnexin or calreticulin or that express an ERp57 mutant that fails to bind to these chaperones. Remarkably, heavy chain disulfides formed at the same rate in these cells as in wild type cells. Moreover, ERp57 formed a mixed disulfide with tapasin and promoted efficient peptide loading in the absence of interactions with calnexin and calreticulin. These findings suggest that ERp57 has the capacity to recognize its substrates directly in addition to being recruited through lectin chaperones. We also found that calreticulin could be recruited into the peptide loading complex in the absence of interactions with both ERp57 and substrate oligosaccharides, demonstrating the importance of its polypeptide binding site in substrate recognition. Finally, by inactivating the redox-active sites of ERp57, we demonstrate that its enzymatic activity is dispensable in stabilizing the peptide loading complex and in supporting efficient peptide loading. Thus, ERp57 appears to play a structural rather than catalytic role within the peptide loading complex."

Moreover, we showed that the presence of presenilins is necessary for obtaining the increase of BACE1 expression under stress conditions (17Tamagno E. Guglielmotto M. Aragno M. Borghi R. Autelli R.

On this basis, we predicted that mutant PS1 might augment the expression of BACE1 by altering the activity of the γ-secretase. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatments-HEK-293 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine (Euroclone, Milano, Italy).

SH-SY5Y and SKNBE(2c) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen). M17 cells were obtained from Dr. Xinglong Wang and Dr. Xiongwei Zhu at the Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106 and cultured in Opti-MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and with 50 μg/ml G418. Transient transfection of empty vector (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen), wild type, and mutant PS1 cDNA (M146V, S170F, L392V, and D385A) and BACE1 in HEK-293 and HEK-293 APPwt cells was carried out with polyethyleneimine (Sigma) at 12 μl/20 μg of DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transient transfection of empty vector, wild type, and mutants PS1 cDNA (M146V, S170F, L392V, and D385A) in MEFs and SKNBE(2c) was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In particular, to improve transfection efficiency in MEFs, cells were transfected in penicillin/streptomycin-free medium at 70% optical confluence. Efficiency of transfection was checked with the use of a green fluorescent protein coding plasmid. APP reconstitution in MEFs APP/APLP2 dko was performed by transfecting a human APP 695 construct together with pcDNA3.1, PS1 wt, or PS1 S170F using Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. For mRNA analysis, cells were collected 4 h after transfection; for protein analysis, cells were collected 12 h after transfection. The γ-secretase inhibitor XIX (Calbiochem) was added at 25 nm to the cells at the time of transfection and replenished every 4 h for 12 h. The BACE1 Inhibitor IV (22Stachel S.J. Coburn C.A.

Generation of SH-SY5Y PS1 S170F Stable Cell Lines-Cells were transfected with SspI linearized and purified pcDNA3.1, PS1 wt, and PS1 S170F constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. G418 was used as mean of selection up to 800 μg/ml in culture medium until resistant clones could be identified. Clones were picked, trypsinized, and transferred to 96 wells in triplicate. DNA was then extracted by NaCl-ethanol precipitation. PCR was conducted with the following primers: PS1 277-S 5′-gcc acc ctg agc cat tat ct-3′ and Universal primer bovine growth hormone primer sequence as antisense primer. Positive clones were sequenced to ascertain the presence or not of the mutation using the primer PS1 291–313 S: 5′-ggc tac cat taa gtc agt cag c-3′. At least two different clones for each stable cell line were analyzed. Treatment of Cultured Cells with Aβ Peptides-Treatments of SH-SY5Y and SKNBE(2c) with Aβ peptides (1–40, 1–42 scramble, and 1–42, Anaspec, San Jose, CA) were started 16–18 h after plating the cells in serum-free medium. Primary neuronal cultures were treated likewise at 14 or 21DIV. The lyophilized commercial peptides were dissolved as a stock solution in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (Sigma) and stored at –80 °C in aliquots. The desired amount was left under the cell culture hood to allow for 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol to evaporate and brought to 1 μm with sterile double-distilled water. Evaluation of BACE1 activity, PS1, BACE1, and APP Protein Levels-BACE1 enzymatic activity was measured in frozen samples of human, mouse brain tissues, and in cultured cells using a fluorometric reaction kit (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. More details are in the supplemental “Experiment Procedures.” For quantification of PS1, BACE1, and APP protein levels, 50 μgof total proteins (obtained by cell lysis R&D buffer, R&D Systems, according to the suggested protocol) were loaded on 9% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels (unless otherwise specified) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were probed with an anti-PS1 polyclonal antibody recognizing a band of about 20 kDa, corresponding to the C-terminal fragment of the protein (1:100; Cell Signaling Inc., Beverly, MA) with an anti-BACE1 polyclonal antibody (1:300; Calbiochem) and with a monoclonal antibody anti-APP (clone 22C11, 1:250 Chemicon International, Temecula, CA); the reactive bands were revealed with ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences). To normalize protein levels of PS1, APP, and of the mature form of BACE1 (75 kDa), membranes were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping reagent (Pierce) and probed with a monoclonal antibody against β-actin (1:6000; Sigma). Western blot determination of PS1 CTFs and Aβ peptides was performed by running protein samples on 10–18% Tris-Tricine gel and transferring the proteins on a 0.20 μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The density of the specific bands was quantified using Quantity One software system (Bio-Rad). RNA Interference-APP 695 RNA silencing was accomplished using the SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) consisting of four duplexes, all designed to target distinct sites within the APP gene. A non-targeting siRNA pool was used as a negative control. siRNAs (100 nm) were transfected in HEK-293 cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions using DharmaFect One transfection reagent (Dharmacon); cells were harvested 48 h after siRNA transfection for mRNA analysis and after 72 h for protein analysis. To verify the inhibition rate after RNA, silencing levels of APP were evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR (forward, 5′-gtt ccg agg ggt aga gtt tg-3′; reverse 5′-cct ggg aca ttc tct ctc gg-3′) and by Western blot (monoclonal antibody 22C11; Chemicon International).

Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22462-22472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PS1 mutations determined a significant elevation of BACE1 mRNA (27–53%), protein levels (172–302%), and activity (81–160%) compared with wild type PS1 expressed at a similar level (Fig. 1, A–C). The increase of BACE1 activity was paralleled by an increase (230–300%) of the secreted APP derivative (βAPPs) resulting from the β-secretase cleavage (Fig. 1C), found in the culture medium. As expected, the PS1 D385A mutant did not determine any significant increase in BACE1 parameters. We then asked whether the presence of endogenous wild type PS1 could affect the extent of BACE1 gene transcription. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking PS1 (MEFs PS1–/–) transfected with PS1 mutants showed an increase of BACE1 mRNA (42–93%) compared with cells transfected with wild type PS1, higher than that observed in HEK293 APPwt cells, indicating that the up-regulation of BACE1 determined by the PS1 mutations was not compensated by the presence of the wild type PS1; also, they showed an increase of BACE1 protein levels (65–311%) and activity (32–73%) compared with cells transfected with wild type PS1 (Fig. 1, D–F). Again, the PS1 aspartate mutant did not have any influence on BACE1. As shown in Fig. 1, B and E, the PS1 D385A CTF is barely visible, as this mutant undergoes little endoproteolysis (28Kim H. Ki H. Park H.S. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22462-22472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Full-length D385A PS1 was detected, ascertaining the efficiency of transfection for this mutant as well (not shown). To verify the specificity of BACE1 antibody on Western blot, we transfected HEK-293 cells either with the empty vector pcDNA3.1 or with a plasmid coding for the full-length BACE1. Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. 1A) showed the same pattern for transfected and endogenous BACE1. Also, to verify the specificity of the BACE1 activity assay, we pretreated HEK-293 APPwt cells with a BACE1 inhibitor (22Stachel S.J. Coburn C.A. Steele T.G. Jones K.G. Loutzenhiser E.F. Gregro A.R.

As predicted, the inhibitor prevented the PS1-mediated increase of BACE1 activity observed in non-treated cells (supplemental Fig. 1B). Several reports have recently shown how BACE1 levels can be controlled by post-translational and post-transcriptional mechanisms (11Rossner S. Sastre M. Bourne K. Lichtenthaler S.F. Prog.

To further confirm the effect of mutant PS1 on BACE1 expression, we generated a line of stable neuroblastoma cells (SHSY-5Y), expressing wild type PS1 and the S170F mutation (34Zhang J. Kang D.E. Xia W. Okochi M. Mori H. Selkoe D.J. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12436-12442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Also, we utilized a similar pre-established line of stable cells, M17, carrying wild type PS1 and the A246E mutation. PS1 A246E stable cells showed (Fig. 2H) a little increase of soluble secreted Aβ40 and a much higher increase of Aβ42 (+24 and 115%, respectively). PS1S170F and A246E mutations determined a significant increase in the levels of BACE1 mRNA (+82.74 and +94.14%), protein levels (+196 and +40.7%), and activity (+40 and + 81%) compared with control cells. (Fig. 2, A–E). As shown by Western blot analysis, SH and M17 stable clones show adequate levels and pattern of PS1 expression and maturation (Fig. 2, B and E). Of note, stable SH-SY5Y cells have levels of PS1 mRNA, measured by Taqman real time PCR, of 1.3–1.9× those of non-transfected cells; similarly, M17 show levels of 1.9–3.0× those of wild type M17 cells (data not shown). PS1 S170F stable cells showed (Fig. 2G) an increase of soluble secreted Aβ40 and -42 (+34 and +71%, respectively), as also reported before (35Piccini A. Zanusso G. Borghi R. Noviello C. Monaco S. Russo R. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Gelati M. Giordano R. Zambenedetti P. Russo C. Ghetti B. Tabaton M. Arch. Neurol. 2007; 64: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both cell lines showed an increase of the Aβ42/40 ratio (S170F, +27%; A246E, +73%), although this was less evident in the S170F mutant, where Aβ40 levels are higher. Mutant PS1 Up-regulates BACE1 in Vivo-To investigate if the same effect observed in vitro is also present in vivo, we first evaluated BACE1 parameters in the brains of mutant PS1 knock-in mice (PS1 M146V KI) that express physiological levels of the human mutant protein. The levels of BACE1 mRNA and activity were significantly increased by 41 and 51% in the brain of mutant PS1 knock-in mice compared with the wild type littermates (Fig. 3, A and C), whereas the 47% elevation of BACE1 protein levels did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3B). Up-regulation of BACE1 was also detected in brains of FAD subjects bearing various PS1 mutations (supplemental Table 1). Levels of BACE1 mRNA and activity were significantly increased on average by 80 and 36%, respectively, in cerebral cortices of 11 FAD cases bearing 10 different PS1 mutations compared with age-matched normal controls (Fig. 3, D and E). Interestingly, in sporadic AD, levels of BACE1 activity, and not mRNA, significantly differ (+24%) from controls, as previously reported (10Borghi R. Patriarca S. Traverso N. Piccini A. Storace D.

The Up-regulation of BACE1 Requires the Presenilins and the Activity of the γ-Secretase-As we have recently shown (17Tamagno E. Guglielmotto M. Aragno M. Borghi R. Autelli R. Giliberto L. Muraca G. Danni O. Zhu X. Smith M.A. Perry G. Jo D.G. Mattson M.P. Tabaton M. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 683-695PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tamagno E. Guglielmotto M. Giliberto L. Vitali A. Borghi R. Autelli R. Danni O. Tabaton M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), PS1/2 and the activity of the γ-secretase are required to obtain the up-regulation of BACE1 induced by oxidative stress. Thus, we asked if the action of the PS1 mutants on BACE1 is also mediated by their involvement in the γ-secretase activity. In HEK-293 APPwt (Fig. 4A) and MEFs PS1–/– (Fig. 4B) cells, transiently transfected with PS1 mutant S170F, BACE1 protein levels were not altered in the presence of a transition state analogue inhibitor of the γ-secretase, suggesting that the up-regulation of BACE1 induced by the PS1 mutations depends on the activity of the γ-secretase. Indeed, in MEFs PS1–/– the basal levels of BACE1 mRNA, protein levels, and activity are lower than in wild type MEFs (–30, –38, and –20%, respectively) (Fig. 4, C–E). As shown before (Fig. 4B, empty vector versus PS1 wt in cells not treated with γ-inhibitor), reconstitution of PS1 in these cells reestablishes the basal values of BACE1 protein levels. Furthermore, in MEFs lacking both presenilins (MEFs PS dko), BACE1 protein levels increase upon reconstitution of PS1/2 by transient transfection (Fig. 4F), as shown by the detection of PS1/2 CTFs. The Up-regulation of BACE1 Requires APP-Because PS1 mutations increase the expression of BACE1 by a mechanism that requires the γ-secretase activity, we asked whether this effect depends on the presence of APP, one major substrate of γ-secretase. MEFs deficient for APP and APP-like protein 2 (MEFs APP/APLP2 dko, or APP dko), also naturally lacking APLP1, were transfected with empty vector, wild type PS1, and PS1 mutants. They did not show any variation of BACE1 mRNA, protein levels, and activity compared with wild type MEFs (Fig. 5, A–C, first and second set of columns). When APP 695 was reconstituted into MEFs APP dko cells, the concomitant transfection of PS1 S170F mutant determined a significant increase of BACE1 parameters. (Fig. 5, A–C, third set of columns). The requirement of APP for the up-regulation of BACE1 was confirmed by another approach. Silencing of APP by RNA interference in HEK-293 cells, subsequently transfected with the PS1 S170F mutant, prevented the increa"
https://openalex.org/W2089032747,"Acute hypoxic/ischemic insults to the forebrain, often resulting in significant cellular loss of the cortical parenchyma, are a major cause of debilitating injury in the industrialized world. A clearer understanding of the pro-death/pro-survival signaling pathways and their downstream targets is critical to the development of therapeutic interventions to mitigate permanent neurological damage.We demonstrate here that the transcriptional repressor ZEB1, thought to be involved in regulating the timing and spatial boundaries of basic-Helix-Loop-Helix transactivator-mediated neurogenic determination/differentiation programs, functions to link a pro-survival transcriptional cascade rapidly induced in cortical neurons in response to experimentally induced ischemia. Employing histological, tissue culture, and molecular biological read-outs, we show that this novel pro-survival response, initiated through the rapid induction of p63, is mediated ultimately by the transcriptional repression of a pro-apoptotic isoform of p73 by ZEB1. We show further that this phylogenetically conserved pathway is induced as well in the human cortex subjected to episodes of clinically relevant stroke.The data presented here provide the first evidence that ZEB1 induction is part of a protective response by neurons to ischemia. The stroke-induced increase in ZEB1 mRNA and protein levels in cortical neurons is both developmentally and phylogenetically conserved and may therefore be part of a fundamental cellular response to this insult. Beyond the context of stroke, the finding that ZEB1 is regulated by a member of the p53 family has implications for cell survival in other tissue and cellular environments subjected to ischemia, such as the myocardium and, in particular, tumor masses."
https://openalex.org/W1990883063,"Aphids, among the most destructive insects to world agriculture, are mainly controlled by organophosphate insecticides that disable the catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Because these agents also affect vertebrate AChEs, they are toxic to non-target species including humans and birds. We previously reported that a cysteine residue (Cys), found at the AChE active site in aphids and other insects but not mammals, might serve as a target for insect-selective pesticides. However, aphids have two different AChEs (termed AP and AO), and only AP-AChE carries the unique Cys. The absence of the active-site Cys in AO-AChE might raise concerns about the utility of targeting that residue. Herein we report the development of a methanethiosulfonate-containing small molecule that, at 6.0 microM, irreversibly inhibits 99% of all AChE activity extracted from the greenbug aphid (Schizaphis graminum) without any measurable inhibition of the human AChE. Reactivation studies using beta-mercaptoethanol confirm that the irreversible inhibition resulted from the conjugation of the inhibitor to the unique Cys. These results suggest that AO-AChE does not contribute significantly to the overall AChE activity in aphids, thus offering new insight into the relative functional importance of the two insect AChEs. More importantly, by demonstrating that the Cys-targeting inhibitor can abolish AChE activity in aphids, we can conclude that the unique Cys may be a viable target for species-selective agents to control aphids without causing human toxicity and resistance problems."
https://openalex.org/W2025818188,"Background It is generally assumed that visual cortical cells homogeneously shift their ocular dominance (OD) in response to monocular deprivation (MD), however little experimental evidence directly supports this notion. By using immunohistochemistry for the activity-dependent markers c-Fos and Arc, coupled with staining for markers of inhibitory cortical sub-populations, we studied whether long-term MD initiated at P21 differentially affects visual response of inhibitory neurons in rat binocular primary visual cortex. Methodology/Principal Findings The inhibitory markers GAD67, parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB) and calretinin (CR) were used. Visually activated Arc did not colocalize with PV and was discarded from further studies. MD decreased visually induced c-Fos activation in GAD67 and CR positive neurons. The CB population responded to MD with a decrease of CB expression, while PV cells did not show any effect of MD on c-Fos expression. The persistence of c-Fos expression induced by deprived eye stimulation in PV cells is not likely to be due to a particularly low threshold for activity-dependent c-Fos induction. Indeed, c-Fos induction by increasing concentrations of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin in visual cortical slices was similar between PV cells and the other cortical neurons. Conclusion These data indicate that PV cells are particularly refractory to MD, suggesting that different cortical subpopulation may show different response to MD."
https://openalex.org/W2090830413,"Throughout lowland Amazonia, arboreal ants collect seeds of specific plants and cultivate them in nutrient-rich nests, forming diverse yet obligate and species-specific symbioses called Neotropical ant-gardens (AGs). The ants depend on their symbiotic plants for nest stability, and the plants depend on AGs for substrate and nutrients. Although the AGs are limited to specific participants, it is unknown at what stage specificity arises, and seed fate pathways in AG epiphytes are undocumented. Here we examine the specificity of the ant-seed interaction by comparing the ant community observed at general food baits to ants attracted to and removing seeds of the AG plant Peperomia macrostachya. We also compare seed removal rates under treatments that excluded vertebrates, arthropods, or both. In the bait study, only three of 70 ant species collected P. macrostachya seeds, and 84% of observed seed removal by ants was attributed to the AG ant Camponotus femoratus. In the exclusion experiment, arthropod exclusion significantly reduced seed removal rates, but vertebrate exclusion did not. We provide the most extensive empirical evidence of species specificity in the AG mutualism and begin to quantify factors that affect seed fate in order to understand conditions that favor its departure from the typical diffuse model of plant-animal mutualism."
https://openalex.org/W2090857376,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play important roles in regulating cell cycle progression, and altered cell cycles resulting from over-expression or abnormal activation of CDKs observed in many human cancers. As a result, CDKs have become extensive studied targets for developing chemical inhibitors for cancer therapies; however, protein kinases share a highly conserved ATP binding pocket at which most chemical inhibitors bind, therefore, a major challenge in developing kinase inhibitors is achieving target selectivity. To identify cell growth inhibitors with potential applications in cancer therapy, we used an integrated approach that combines one-pot chemical synthesis in a combinatorial manner to generate diversified small molecules with new chemical scaffolds coupled with growth inhibition assay using developing zebrafish embryos. We report the successful identification of a novel lead compound that displays selective inhibitory effects on CDK2 activity, cancer cell proliferation, and tumor progression in vivo. Our approaches should have general applications in developing cell proliferation inhibitors using an efficient combinatorial chemical genetic method and integrated biological assays. The novel cell growth inhibitor we identified should have potential as a cancer therapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2070330648,"Conditional gene targeting strategies are progressively used to study gene function tissue-specifically and/or at a defined time period. Instrumental to all of these strategies is the generation of targeting vectors, and any methodology that would streamline the procedure would be highly beneficial. We describe a comprehensive transposition-based strategy to produce gene-targeting vectors for the generation of mouse conditional alleles. The system employs a universal cloning vector and two custom-designed mini-Mu transposons. It produces targeting constructions directly from BAC clones, and the alleles generated are modifiable by Cre and Flp recombinases. We demonstrate the applicability of the methodology by modifying two mouse genes, Chd22 and Drapc1. This straightforward strategy should be readily suitable for high-throughput targeting vector production."
https://openalex.org/W2072458053,"Background Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the dhfr and dhps genes are associated with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) treatment failure and gametocyte carriage. This may result in enhanced transmission of mutant malaria parasites, as previously shown for chloroquine resistant parasites. In the present study, we determine the association between parasite mutations, submicroscopic P. falciparum gametocytemia and malaria transmission to mosquitoes. Methodology/Principal Findings Samples from children treated with SP alone or in combination with artesunate (AS) or amodiaquine were genotyped for SNPs in the dhfr and dhps genes. Gametocytemia was determined by microscopy and Pfs25 RNA–based quantitative nucleic acid sequence–based amplification (Pfs25 QT-NASBA). Transmission was determined by membrane-feeding assays. We observed no wild type infections, 66.5% (127/191) of the infections expressed mutations at all three dhfr codons prior to treatment. The presence of all three mutations was not related to higher Pfs25 QT-NASBA gametocyte prevalence or density during follow-up, compared to double mutant infections. The proportion of infected mosquitoes or oocyst burden was also not related to the number of mutations. Addition of AS to SP reduced gametocytemia and malaria transmission during follow-up. Conclusions/Significance In our study population where all infections had at least a double mutation in the dhfr gene, additional mutations were not related to increased submicroscopic gametocytemia or enhanced malaria transmission. The absence of wild-type infections is likely to have reduced our power to detect differences. Our data further support the use of ACT to reduce the transmission of drug-resistant malaria parasites."

https://openalex.org/W2075955385,"The type 1 interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R1) mediates diverse functions of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the nervous, immune, and neuroendocrine systems. It has been suggested previously that the versatile functions of IL-1 may in part be conferred by the multiple promoters of IL-1R1 that have been identified for the human IL-1R1 gene. Promoters for murine IL-1R1 (mIL-1R1) gene have not been studied in detail. We performed 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to determine the transcription start sites (TSS) in mIL-1R1, using mRNAs derived from 24 different tissues. The results revealed three putative TSSs of mIL-1R1. Three full-length cDNAs containing these distinct TSSs were recovered in screens of cloned cDNA libraries. Translation of these cDNAs produced IL-1R1 proteins that were verified by Western blot analysis. IL-1 stimulation of the individual IL-1R1 proteins resulted in the activation of NF-kappaB. Promoter-reporter assay for genomic DNA sequences immediately upstream of the three TSSs validated that the sequences possess promoter activity in a cell type-specific manner. These promoters are termed P1, P2, and P3 of the mIL-1R1, in 5' to 3' order. Quantitative PCR analysis of P1-, P2-, and P3-specific mIL-1R1 mRNAs showed that there is tissue-specific distribution of these mRNAs in vivo, and there are distinct patterns of P1, P2, and P3 mRNA expression in different cell lines. In the brain, P3 mRNA is expressed preferentially in the dentate gyrus. Further, glucocorticoids differentially regulate these promoters in a cell type-specific manner. Together, these results suggest that the different IL-1R1 promoters contribute to the discrete and diverse actions of IL-1."
https://openalex.org/W1993128822,"Ionising radiation is a carcinogen capable of inducing tumours, including colorectal cancer, in both humans and animals. By backcrossing a recombinant line of ApcMin/+ mice to the inbred BALB/c mouse strain, which is unusually sensitive to radiation–induced tumour development, we obtained panels of 2Gy-irradiated and sham-irradiated N2 ApcMin/+ mice for genotyping with a genome-wide panel of microsatellites at ∼15 cM density and phenotyping by counting adenomas in the small intestine. Interval and composite interval mapping along with permutation testing identified five significant susceptibility quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for radiation induced tumour multiplicity in the small intestine. These were defined as Mom (Modifier of Min) radiation-induced polyposis (Mrip1-5) on chromosome 2 (log of odds, LOD 2.8, p = 0.0003), two regions within chromosome 5 (LOD 5.2, p<0.00001, 6.2, p<0.00001) and two regions within chromosome 16 respectively (LOD 4.1, p = 4×10−5, 4.8, p<0.00001). Suggestive QTLs were found for sham-irradiated mice on chromosomes 3, 6 and 13 (LOD 1.7, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively; p<0.005). Genes containing BALB/c specific non-synonymous polymorphisms were identified within Mrip regions and prediction programming used to locate potentially functional polymorphisms. Our study locates the QTL regions responsible for increased radiation-induced intestinal tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice and identifies candidate genes with predicted functional polymorphisms that are involved in spindle checkpoint and chromosomal stability (Bub1b, Casc5, and Bub1), DNA repair (Recc1 and Prkdc) or inflammation (Duox2, Itgb2l and Cxcl5). Our study demonstrates use of in silico analysis in candidate gene identification as a way of reducing large-scale backcross breeding programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2040901854,"We studied how well first-year medical students understand and apply the concept of substituted judgment, following a course on clinical ethics.Students submitted essays on one of three ethically controversial scenarios presented in class. One scenario involved a patient who had lost decisional capacity. Through an iterative process of textual analysis, the essays were studied and coded for patterns in the ways students misunderstood or misapplied the principle of substituted judgment.Students correctly articulated course principles regarding patient autonomy, substituted judgment, and non-imposition of physician values. However, students showed misunderstanding by giving doctors the responsibility of balancing the interests of the patient against the interests of the family, by stating doctors and surrogates should be guided primarily by a best-interest standard, and by suggesting that patient autonomy becomes the guiding principle only when patients can no longer express their wishes.Students did not appear to internalize or correctly apply the substituted judgment standard, even though they could describe it accurately. This suggests the substituted judgment standard may run counter to students' moral intuitions, making it harder to apply in clinical practice."
