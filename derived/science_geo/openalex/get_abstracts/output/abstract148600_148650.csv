https://openalex.org/W2333852662,"Hepatitis B viral X protein (HBx) and the human p53 protein (p53) have been known as a transactivator and as a tumor suppressor, respectively. These two proteins have also been known to interact with each other to neutralize their authentic functions and the p53 represses the HBV enhancer/X promoter activity. Here we report that the promoter activity of the human p53 gene was strongly repressed by the HBx using the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assay. Analyses of serial deletion, site-directed mutagenesis and the heterologous promoter system showed that the site responsible for the repression was the E-box element in the promoter of the p53 gene. In addition, HBx as expected also repressed the activation of the p53 promoter by c-Myc through the E-box element. Northern blot analyses also showed that the expression of the p53 gene in the HepG2-K8 cell line, which expresses HBV genes including HBx, was much more repressed than that of the control cell HepG2. These results with previous data suggest that the shift of the reciprocal inhibitory activities at the levels of protein-protein interaction and transcription between HBx and p53 may play a decisive role in the HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2321970319,"Bcl-2 has been associated with both oxidative and antioxidative effects in vivo. Moreover, despite evidence that Bcl-2 is antiapoptotic by virtue of its effect on reactive oxygen species and their scavengers, Bcl-2 exerts its antiapoptotic effects even under anaerobic conditions. The reasons for the variable relationship between Bcl-2 and reactive oxygen species are not clear. The present studies demonstrate that the impact of Bcl-2 on glutathione (GSH) metabolism is cell line-dependent. Bcl-2 overproduction in PC12 cells is associated with increased functional thiol reserves, increased reductive activation of chemotherapeutic prodrugs, and GSH accumulation after treatment with N-acetylcysteine. In contrast, Bcl-2-overproducing MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrate neither altered GSH handling nor potentiation of chemotherapeutic prodrug reduction. These findings indicate that the effects of Bcl-2 on GSH handling are millieu-dependent. This could account for the variable effects of Bcl-2 in in vivo systems. Furthermore, since our previous studies have demonstrated that reduction-dependent prodrugs may be useful chemotherapeutic agents against tumors that demonstrate altered GSH handling, screening in vitro for alteration of GSH handling may predict responsiveness of such tumors to these reduction-dependent agents."

The larger E1B proteins of both Ad2/5 and Ad12 bind to p53 and inhibit its ability to transcriptionally activate other genes. We have previously demonstrated that synthetic peptides identical to the binding sites for p53 on both the Ad2 and Ad12 E1B proteins will disrupt the interaction in vivo and in vitro. In the work presented here we have examined the effects of complex dissociation on Ad E1-transformed human cells. It has been shown, using confocal microscopy, that when the peptide identical to the p53 binding site was added to Ad5 E1-transformed cells it initally located in the cytoplasmic dense bodies where it caused disruption of the p53/E1B complex. Peptide and p53 then translocated to the nucleus. In Ad12 E1-transformed cells the peptide localized in the nucleus directly and there caused a reorganization of p53 staining from a highly organized, 'flecked' distribution to one in which nuclear staining was homogeneous and diffuse. Peptides added to either Ad5 E1 or Ad12 E1 transformed cells resulted in the release of transcriptionally active p53. Interestingly, the level of p53 then fell presumably as a result of proteasomal action - this was probably a reflection of the short half-life of 'free' (i.e. dissociated) p53 compared to that of the bound protein. Free p53 did not cause apoptosis in target cells probably due to the presence of the smaller (19K) E1B proteins. However, addition of peptide leads to a significant reduction in cell growth rate. We have further demonstrated that a significant proportion of those cells which had taken up peptide had ceased DNA synthesis, probably due to a p53-induced cell cycle arrest. The role of the larger EIB protein during transformation is considered in view of these data."
