https://openalex.org/W4281714747,"Gene therapy offers great promise in addressing neuropathologies associated with the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS). However, genetic access remains difficult, reflecting the critical need for the development of effective and non-invasive gene delivery vectors across species. To that end, we evolved adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) capsid in mice and validated two capsids, AAV-MaCPNS1 and AAV-MaCPNS2, across rodent species (mice and rats) and non-human primate (NHP) species (marmosets and rhesus macaques). Intravenous administration of either AAV efficiently transduced the PNS in rodents and both the PNS and CNS in NHPs. Furthermore, we used AAV-MaCPNS1 in mice to systemically deliver the following: (1) the neuronal sensor jGCaMP8s to record calcium signal dynamics in nodose ganglia and (2) the neuronal actuator DREADD to dorsal root ganglia to mediate pain. This conclusively demonstrates the translatability of these two systemic AAVs across four species and their functional utility through proof-of-concept studies in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4281847494,"The type III-E CRISPR-Cas effector Cas7-11, with dual RNase activities for precursor CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA) processing and crRNA-guided target RNA cleavage, is a new platform for bacterial and mammalian RNA targeting. We report the 2.5-Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure of Cas7-11 in complex with a crRNA and its target RNA. Cas7-11 adopts a modular architecture comprising seven domains (Cas7.1-Cas7.4, Cas11, INS, and CTE) and four interdomain linkers. The crRNA 5' tag is recognized and processed by Cas7.1, whereas the crRNA spacer hybridizes with the target RNA. Consistent with our biochemical data, the catalytic residues for programmable cleavage in Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 neighbor the scissile phosphates before the flipped-out fourth and tenth nucleotides in the target RNA, respectively. Using structural insights, we rationally engineered a compact Cas7-11 variant (Cas7-11S) for single-vector AAV packaging for transcript knockdown in human cells, enabling in vivo Cas7-11 applications."

https://openalex.org/W4281683326,"Networks are useful for representing phenomena in a broad range of domains. Although their ability to represent complexity can be a virtue, it is sometimes useful to focus on a simplified network that contains only the most important edges: the backbone. This paper introduces and demonstrates a substantially expanded version of the backbone package for R, which now provides methods for extracting backbones from weighted networks, weighted bipartite projections, and unweighted networks. For each type of network, fully replicable code is presented first for small toy examples, then for complete empirical examples using transportation, political, and social networks. The paper also demonstrates the implications of several issues of statistical inference that arise in backbone extraction. It concludes by briefly reviewing existing applications of backbone extraction using the backbone package, and future directions for research on network backbone extraction."
https://openalex.org/W4281927055,"This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the association between subclinical atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and a synergistic effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) and MAFLD on subclinical atherosclerosis.Of 977 subjects who underwent health checkups with coronary artery calcification (CAC), carotid intima-media thickness, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV), 890 were included in this study. They were classified as MAFLD, NAFLD, or Neither-FLD, and MAFLD was further categorized into three groups by three metabolic disorders (obesity, lean with metabolic dysregulation, DM), according to its new definition: Obesity-MAFLD, Lean-MAFLD and DM-MAFLD.In a multivariable analysis, MAFLD and NAFLD were significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis, except for an association between ba-PWV and NAFLD. MAFLD had higher odds for CAC than NAFLD (for CAC score > 100, odds ratio (OR) = 2.599, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.625-4.157; OR = 1.795, 95%CI = 1.145-2.814, respectively). In a sub-analysis, DM-MAFLD had higher odds for CAC (for CAC score > 100, OR = 5.833, 95%CI = 3.047-11.164) than the other groups of MAFLD, when compared to Neither FLD as a reference. Moreover, DM-MAFLD had a higher level of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and high sensitive C-reactive protein, compared to the other groups of MAFLD.MAFLD was significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in the general population. Additionally, DM-MAFLD could be a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease through insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation and requires careful follow-up or appropriate intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4281493457,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves the neurotoxic self-assembly of a 40 and 42 residue peptide, Amyloid-β (Aβ). Inherited early-onset AD can be caused by single point mutations within the Aβ sequence, including Arctic (E22G) and Italian (E22K) familial mutants. These mutations are heterozygous, resulting in an equal proportion of the WT and mutant Aβ isoform expression. It is therefore important to understand how these mixtures of Aβ isoforms interact with each other and influence the kinetics and morphology of their assembly into oligomers and fibrils. Using small amounts of nucleating fibril seeds, here, we systematically monitored the kinetics of fibril formation, comparing self-seeding with cross-seeding behavior of a range of isoform mixtures of Aβ42 and Aβ40. We confirm that Aβ40(WT) does not readily cross-seed Aβ42(WT) fibril formation. In contrast, fibril formation of Aβ40(Arctic) is hugely accelerated by Aβ42(WT) fibrils, causing an eight-fold reduction in the lag-time to fibrillization. We propose that cross-seeding between the more abundant Aβ40(Arctic) and Aβ42(WT) may be important for driving early-onset AD and will propagate fibril morphology as indicated by fibril twist periodicity. This kinetic behavior is not emulated by the Italian mutant, where minimal cross-seeding is observed. In addition, we studied the cross-seeding behavior of a C-terminal-amidated Aβ42 analog to probe the coulombic charge interplay between Glu22/Asp23/Lys28 and the C-terminal carboxylate. Overall, these studies highlight the role of cross-seeding between WT and mutant Aβ40/42 isoforms, which can impact the rate and structure of fibril assembly."
https://openalex.org/W4285741163,"Several studies have demonstrated that helminth infections provide a degree of protection against Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the relationship between Strongyloides stercoralis infection and T2DM has scarcely been investigated and the protective effect of infection against development of diabetic complications is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between S. stercoralis infection and T2DM in a rural area of Khon Kaen Province, Thailand. The impact of S. stercoralis infection on diabetic complication-related kidney function biochemical parameters and body-mass index (BMI) was also assessed.Using a cross-sectional study design, S. stercoralis infection and T2DM assessments were conducted between October 2020 and May 2021. Associations between S. stercoralis infection, T2DM, and socioeconomic factors were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Diabetic complication-related biochemical parameters relating largely to kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), serum creatinine, uric acid, alanine transaminase (ALT), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)) and BMI of participants with and without T2DM were compared between groups with or without S. stercoralis infection.One hundred and seven out of 704 individuals (15.20%) were positive for S. stercoralis, and 283 people were diagnosed with T2DM. Of those with T2DM, 11.31% (32/283) were infected with S. stercoralis and of those without T2DM, 17.82% (75/421) were infected with S. stercoralis. Multivariate analysis revealed that T2DM was inversely correlated with S. stercoralis infection (Adjusted OR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.78; p = 0.003), while male, increasing age, lower education level, and alcohol intake were positively associated with infection. Those infected with S. stercoralis had lower eGFR levels and higher ALT and UACR levels than those in the uninfected group.This finding indicates that S. stercoralis infection was inversely associated with T2DM in northeastern Thailand, but participants infected with S. stercoralis had lower eGFR levels and higher ALT and UACR levels. Infection with S. stercoralis might lead to worse complication-related renal biochemical parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4281707942,"Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) has been shown to exhibit protective effects on intestinal barrier function in septic rats, although the regulatory mechanism has not been established. We determined whether LP imparts such protective effects in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Caco2 cell monolayer model and whether cAMP-PKA signaling is the underlying mechanism of action. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) agonist, forskolin (FSK), and the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, HT89, were used to study the protective effect of LP on the destruction of the tight junction (TJ) structure of cells treated with LPS and the corresponding changes in cAMP-PKA signaling. Our experimental results demonstrated that LP promoted the expression of TJ proteins between Caco2 cells after LPS treatment, and increased the electrical barrier detection (TEER) between Caco2 cells. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the TJ structural integrity of cells treated with LPS + LP was improved compared to cells treated with LPS alone. In addition, our findings were consistent between the FSK and LP intervention group, while HT89 inhibited LP influence. Taken together, our results indicate that LP has an improved protective effect on LPS-induced damage to the monolayer membrane barrier function of Caco2 cells and is regulated by the cAMP-PKA pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4285740244,"The spectrum of HIV-associated kidney disease has expanded significantly with the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). In the pre-ART era there was prominence of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). More recently, the spectrum of disease additionally reflects comorbid illness in the ageing HIV population and ART-related nephrotoxicity. We performed a clinicopathological correlation of kidney disease in HIV-positive individuals who underwent kidney biopsy between 1989 and 2014, utilizing the 2018 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes pathologic classification. ART rollout began in 2004 in South Africa. Patients biopsied pre-ART rollout were compared to those biopsied post-ART rollout with respect to demographics, clinical parameters and histology. We assessed kidney survival in a cohort of these patients following biopsy. Six hundred and ninety biopsies were included, 99 (14.3%) were undertaken pre- and 591 (85.7%) post-ART rollout. Most patients were of Black African descent (97.5%). The post-ART rollout patients were older (p = 0.007), had higher eGFR at presentation (p = 0.016) and fewer presented with eGFR of less than 15ml/min/1.73m 2 (p = 0.0008). There was a decrease in the prevalence of classic HIVAN (p = 0.00001); and an increase in FSGS (NOS) in the setting of HIV (p = 0.0022) and tubulointerstitial diseases (p = 0.009) post-ART rollout. Kidney function survival over 5 years was poorest in patients with classic HIVAN (p = 0.00005) and best in minimal change nephropathy (p = 0.0013). Kidney biopsy is crucial for the correct diagnosis and management of HIV-related kidney disease. ART rollout has shifted the spectrum of kidney disease away from classic HIVAN but has not eliminated it. Histological diagnosis prognosticates kidney survival."
https://openalex.org/W4281568460,"During epididymal transit, redox remodeling protects mammalian spermatozoa, preparing them for survival in the subsequent journey to fertilization. However, molecular mechanisms of redox regulation in sperm development and maturation remain largely elusive. In this study, we report that thioredoxin-glutathione reductase (TXNRD3), a thioredoxin reductase family member particularly abundant in elongating spermatids at the site of mitochondrial sheath formation, regulates redox homeostasis to support male fertility. Using Txnrd3−/− mice, our biochemical, ultrastructural, and live cell imaging analyses revealed impairments in sperm morphology and motility under conditions of TXNRD3 deficiency. We find that mitochondria develop more defined cristae during capacitation in wildtype sperm. Furthermore, we show that absence of TXNRD3 alters thiol redox status in both the head and tail during sperm maturation and capacitation, resulting in defective mitochondrial ultrastructure and activity under capacitating conditions. These findings provide insights into molecular mechanisms of redox homeostasis and bioenergetics during sperm maturation, capacitation, and fertilization.

Testicular sperm are functionally immature in that they lack the ability to naturally fertilize an egg. Epididymis transit is an indispensable step for mammalian sperm cells to fully develop the fertilizing ability. During epididymal descent, spermatozoa acquire the potential to develop progressive motility and capacitation (1Sullivan R. Mieusset R. The human epididymis: its function in sperm maturation.Hum. Reprod. Update. 2016; 22: 574-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Gervasi M.G. Visconti P.E. Molecular changes and signaling events occurring in spermatozoa during epididymal maturation.Andrology. 2017; 5: 204-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). One major threat to sperm for the subsequent journey to fertilization is oxidative damage since sperm plasma membrane is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (3Vernet P. Aitken R.J. Drevet J.R. Antioxidant strategies in the epididymis.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 216: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Redox mechanisms prepare epididymal spermatozoa for their protection and survival during the fertilization journey (4Chabory E. Damon C. Lenoir A. Kauselmann G. Kern H. Zevnik B. et al.Epididymis seleno-independent glutathione peroxidase 5 maintains sperm DNA integrity in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2074-2085PubMed Google Scholar). For example, oxidation of the intracellular milieu is involved in mammalian sperm maturation and capacitation (5O'Flaherty C. Redox regulation of mammalian sperm capacitation.Asian J.

Reprod. 1997; 2: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). At the same time, oxidative damage correlates with lower motility of human sperm (7Kao S.H. Chao H.T. Chen H.W. Hwang T.I.S.

However, it remains unclear how redox homeostasis is maintained during mammalian sperm capacitation.Thioredoxin and glutathione systems are two major redox systems that utilize the thiol redox biology to maintain cellular redox homeostasis and protect against oxidative stress. Thioredoxin reductases, a family of selenium-containing pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases, are key redox regulators of mammalian thioredoxin system. They are comprised of three enzymes: thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), thioredoxin reductase 2 (TXNRD2) (9Holmgren A.

TXNRD1 and TXNRD2 are essential proteins that support redox homeostasis in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively (13Arnér E.S. Holmgren A.

A. 2001; 98: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and particularly abundant in elongating spermatids at the site of mitochondrial sheath formation (17Su D. Novoselov S.V. Sun Q.A. Moustafa M.E. Zhou Y. Oko R. et al.Mammalian selenoprotein thioredoxin-glutathione reductase. Roles in disulfide bond formation and sperm maturation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26491-26498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Structurally, TXNRD3 contains an additional N-terminal glutaredoxin domain compared with the other two TXNRD isozymes (12Sun Q.A. Kirnarsky L. Sherman S. Gladyshev V.N. Selenoprotein oxidoreductase with specificity for thioredoxin and glutathione systems.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, it has affinity to both thioredoxin and glutathione systems in vitro (12Sun Q.A. Kirnarsky L. Sherman S. Gladyshev V.N.

A. 2001; 98: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and can reduce both. Disulfide bond isomerase activity of TXNRD3 was also previously reported in vitro (17Su D. Novoselov S.V. Sun Q.A. Moustafa M.E. Zhou Y. Oko R. et al.Mammalian selenoprotein thioredoxin-glutathione reductase. Roles in disulfide bond formation and sperm maturation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26491-26498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), yet the physiological significance and underlying mechanisms of TXNRD3 in male germ cell development and sperm function have been largely unknown.Here, we report that targeted disruption of Txnrd3 in mice induces capacitation-associated impairment in sperm morphology and motility. We find that TXNRD3 functions during epididymal sperm maturation in regulating chromatin organization and capacitation-associated mitochondrial activity. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that TXNRD3 protein levels diminish during sperm maturation, impairing redox homeostasis of head and flagellar proteins. Using ultrastructural analyses and live cell imaging, we reveal that mitochondria in Txnrd3−/− sperm undergo structural defects and lose control of its activity especially during sperm capacitation. These findings provide insights into sperm redox regulation during epididymal maturation and its effect on capacitation-associated energy metabolism.ResultsTxnrd3−/− sperm cells display defects in morphology and motility under capacitating conditionsIn the accompanying study by Dou et al. (2022) (18Dou Q. Turanov A. Mariotti M. Hwang J.Y. Wang H. Lee S.G. et al.TXNRD3 supports male fertility via the redox control of spermatogenesis.bioRxiv. 2021; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.29.474493Crossref Google Scholar), we showed that Txnrd3−/− mice compromise fertility in vivo and sperm fertilizing ability in vitro. To understand why Txnrd3−/− males exhibit sub-fertility in vivo and in vitro (18Dou Q. Turanov A. Mariotti M. Hwang J.Y. Wang H. Lee S.G. et al.TXNRD3 supports male fertility via the redox control of spermatogenesis.bioRxiv. 2021; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.29.474493Crossref Google Scholar), we first examined sperm morphology and count from the cauda epididymis. The number of sperm produced by Txnrd3−/− males was smaller than that from 2 to 3 months old heterozygous littermates (Fig. S1A). Among them, some Txnrd3−/− sperm displayed bending within midpiece, specifically evident after 90 min incubation under capacitating conditions (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas sperm bent around annulus (i.e., hairpin) were negligible in both wildtype and Txnrd3−/− mice. Scanning electron microscopy analysis did not reveal any gross abnormalities in the sperm midpiece (Fig. 1C).Prompted by the observation of capacitation-associated bending within midpiece of Txnrd3−/− sperm, we next analyzed sperm motility. Flagellar waveform analysis revealed that Txnrd3−/− sperm become stiff in the midpiece and beat abnormally after incubating under capacitating conditions (Figs. 1D and S1B and Video S1). Accordingly, CASA analysis found that overall motility of Txnrd3−/− sperm was diminished (Fig. S1C). By contrast, hyperactivated motility was not significantly affected, likely because the Txnrd3−/− sperm that are not bent still developed hyperactivated motility. To better understand the effect of TXNRD3 deficiency on free-swimming pattern, sperm cells were placed in 0.3% methylcellulose which mimics viscous environment in the female reproductive tract. Swimming trajectory traced by time-lapse video microscope demonstrated that Txnrd3−/− sperm move a shorter distance at a given time after capacitation (Fig. 1E and Video S2), suggesting that the bending within midpiece prevents them from swimming as efficiently as wildtype sperm.Absence of TXNRD3 affects the redox state of both head and tail of spermTXNRD3 is enriched in the testis but not readily detected in the epididymis (17Su D. Novoselov S.V. Sun Q.A. Moustafa M.E. Zhou Y. Oko R. et al.Mammalian selenoprotein thioredoxin-glutathione reductase. Roles in disulfide bond formation and sperm maturation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26491-26498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our analysis of the publicly available scRNA-seq dataset of mouse testis (19Speir M.L. Bhaduri A. Markov N.S. Moreno P. Nowakowski T.J. Papatheodorou I. et al.UCSC cell browser: visualize your single-cell data.Bioinformatics. 2021; 37: 4578-4580Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) found that Txrnd3 mRNA expresses gradually more from spermatogonia, spermatocytes, to early spermatids but the expression level is much reduced in late spermatids (Fig. S2). We hypothesized that diminishing TXNRD3 mRNA and protein levels during sperm development underlies the changes in the overall redox state of sperm proteins along the epididymal tract and subsequent capacitation of sperm. Thus, we examined the distribution and the extent of protein thiol modification in the absence of TXNRD3 by labeling epididymal sperm cells with ThiolTracker that reacts with reduced thiols (free “-SH”) irreversibly (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with the previously reported increasing disulfide bond formation in sperm during their transit along the male reproductive tract (20Dias G.M. López M.L. Ferreira A.T. Chapeaurouge D.A. Rodrigues A. Perales J. et al.Thiol-disulfide proteins of stallion epididymal spermatozoa.Anim. Reprod. Sci. 2014; 145: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), wildtype sperm from corpus and cauda region displayed gradually diminishing fluorescence intensity, more noticeably in the head, whereas caput sperm exhibited strong fluorescence over the entire cell (Fig. 2, A and B). Using BODIPY-NEM, another thiol-reactive dye, we also found that, in the absence of TXNRD3, free thiol content is further decreased modestly, yet significantly, in cauda sperm (Fig. S3A). Loss of TXNRD3 did not affect the overall diminishing fluorescence patterns from caput to cauda. It is possible that other reductases function redundantly and compensate for the loss of TXNRD3. Indeed, both TXNRD1 and TXNRD2 proteins are equally detected in wildtype and Txnrd3−/− sperm (Fig. S3B). In the absence of TXNRD3, however, free thiol content was significantly lower in the head of cauda sperm as well as in the midpiece of caput and cauda sperm than those of wildtype (Figs. 2, A and B and 3A, arrowheads).Figure 2Free thiol level and oxidative status are altered in Txnrd3−/− spermatozoa.

As the oxidized proteins in cauda sperm might be more resistant to be extracted in SDS lysis buffer likely due to more extensive cross-linking involving disulfide bond, we employed urea to solubilize sperm proteins. Under this condition, we found no significant difference in TXNRD3 protein levels from caput, corpus, and cauda sperm (Fig. 2C). Yet, TXNRD3 in sperm was indeed less soluble in SDS lysis buffer during their descent through epididymis (Fig. 2, D and E). This suggests that TXNRD3 itself is likely a substrate of thioredoxin system and is oxidized during epididymal maturation, affecting its enzymatic activity.Sperm midpiece harbors compartmentalized mitochondria (21Skinner M.K. Encyclopedia of Reproduction. Elsevier Science, Netherlands2018Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1C). As Txnrd3−/− sperm specifically exhibit the bending within the midpiece, next we tested whether the TXNRD3 loss-of-function affects the redox states of mitochondrial proteins more specifically.

By contrast, urea readily extracted GPX4 even from cauda sperm (Fig. 2F, supernatant), indicating that GPX4 becomes gradually more oxidized during epididymal transit, therefore SDS-insoluble. Intriguingly, we observed a urea-insoluble GPX4 fraction in Txnrd3−/− cauda sperm, but not in wildtype, when the pellet was further solubilized by guanidine following urea treatment (Fig. 2E, pellet). The altered thiol redox status of GPX4 might affect its function in reducing hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides against oxidative stress (23Forcina G.C. Dixon S.J.

Other nonstructural but membrane proteins localized in sperm mitochondria or midpiece such as ANT4 (ADP/ATP translocase 4), P2X2 (P2X purinoceptor 2), TOM20 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20), and the other two thioredoxin reductases—TXNRD1 and TXNRD2—were well solubilized in all detergents tested (Figs. 2F and S3B). Taken together, our data clearly showed that TXNRD3 is involved in thiol redox regulation of sperm proteins during epididymal transition. In the accompanying manuscript (18Dou Q. Turanov A. Mariotti M. Hwang J.Y. Wang H. Lee S.G. et al.TXNRD3 supports male fertility via the redox control of spermatogenesis.bioRxiv. 2021; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.29.474493Crossref Google Scholar), we provide further evidence that TXNRD3 reduces a broad range of substrates during epididymal sperm maturation.Deregulation of capacitation-associated oxidation in chromatin organization in Txnrd3−/− spermIt has been known that redox signaling is involved in sperm capacitation (5O'Flaherty C. Redox regulation of mammalian sperm capacitation.Asian J. Androl. 2015; 17: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We next examined how free thiol levels change during sperm capacitation. Under capacitating conditions, wildtype sperm isolated from cauda epididymis were less reactive with ThiolTracker, particularly in the head, whereas Txnrd3−/− sperm was not reactive regardless (Fig. 3A, arrowheads). These results suggest that sperm proteins were more oxidized in the absence of TXNRD3 during sperm maturation, which remain relatively stable during capacitation. To test this idea, we examined protein oxidation levels by detecting carbonyl groups inserted into proteins. Incubating sperm under capacitating conditions dramatically increased sperm protein carbonylation in general, consistent with the idea of active oxidative reactions occur during capacitation. We observed that the protein oxidation level was further enhanced in Txnrd3−/− sperm (Figs. 3B and S4A). The cellular oxidation during sperm capacitation might be associated with superoxide dismutase 1 decrease (Fig. S4B), consistent with the note that ROS level increases during sperm capacitation (25de Lamirande E.

The identity of proteins subject to capacitation-associated oxidation remains to be determined.As the free thiol level changes were most dramatic in the head, we next investigated the loss of TXNRD3 function on sperm chromatin organization. We examined the extent of DNA integrity by halo assay where radial dispersion of the DNA fragments from the nucleus was measured upon artificial acid denaturation; the bigger the halo size is, the less damaged DNA fragment is present (27Chohan K.R. Griffin J.T. Lafromboise M. De Jonge C.J. Carrell D.T. Comparison of chromatin assays for DNA fragmentation evaluation in human sperm.J.

Intriguingly, Txnrd3−/− sperm resist the denaturation better, developing smaller halos than those of wildtype sperm (Fig. 4, A and B). This result suggests that more damaged, double-stranded DNA fragments are present in the nucleus in the absence of TXNRD3, likely due to more DNA fragments crosslinked to proteins. The nuclei of sperm incubated under capacitating conditions, developed smaller halos in both wildtype and Txnrd3−/− sperm (Fig. 4, A and B). We further evaluated the altered resistance of DNA to acid denaturation by acridine orange (AO) assay; AO produces different emission when bound to single versus double stranded DNA (30Eggert-Kruse W. Rohr G. Kerbel H. Schwalbach B. Demirakca T. Klinga K. et al.The acridine orange test: a clinically relevant screening method for sperm quality during infertility investigation?.Hum.

We observed that double-stranded DNA was more stable and resistant to acid denaturation in both nucleus and mitochondria in capacitated Txnrd3−/− sperm (Fig. S5). Taken together, the thiol oxidoreductase function is diminished in Txnrd3−/− sperm compared to wildtype sperm. The data show that TXNRD3 supports redox regulation of epididymal sperm maturation, protecting mitochondrial structure and chromatin from oxidative damage during sperm capacitation.Figure 4TXNRD3-deficient sperm are more stable and resistant to acid denaturation after capacitation. A, sperm chromatin dispersion test evaluated smaller halo in Txnrd3−/− sperm than that in wildtype sperm during capacitation, indicating extensive fragmented DNA after acid denaturation in Txnrd3−/− sperm head. DNA was stained by DAPI (blue) after acid denaturation. B, quantification of halo sizes from wild type and Txnrd3−/− sperm before and after capacitation. Based on sperm head size (∼8 μm), halo sizes are classified as small (<12 μm, ∼50% larger than head), medium (<17 μm, ∼100% larger), and big (>17 μm), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lack of TXNRD3 dysregulates capacitation-induced remodeling of sperm mitochondrial ultrastructureTo maintain motility and support capacitation after ejaculation, mammalian sperm utilize nutrient molecules in the seminal plasma and in the female reproductive tract environment to generate energy (32Visconti P.E.

This makes predicting human decision-making challenging to be treated agnostically to the underlying psychological mechanisms. We propose here to use a recurrent neural network architecture based on long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to predict the time series of the actions taken by human subjects engaged in gaming activity, the first application of such methods in this research domain. In this study, we collate the human data from 8 published literature of the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma comprising 168,386 individual decisions and post-process them into 8,257 behavioral trajectories of 9 actions each for both players. Similarly, we collate 617 trajectories of 95 actions from 10 different published studies of Iowa Gambling Task experiments with healthy human subjects. We train our prediction networks on the behavioral data and demonstrate a clear advantage over the state-of-the-art methods in predicting human decision-making trajectories in both the single-agent scenario of the Iowa Gambling Task and the multi-agent scenario of the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. Moreover, we observe that the weights of the LSTM networks modeling the top performers tend to have a wider distribution compared to poor performers, as well as a larger bias, which suggest possible interpretations for the distribution of strategies adopted by each group."

The non-native red macroalga Gracilaria vermiculophylla may provide nursery habitat where eelgrass Zostera marina has been extirpated in Chesapeake Bay. A mensurative experiment was conducted monthly May–October 2013 and 2014 in the York River, Chesapeake Bay, to evaluate hypotheses that Gracilaria (1) can compensate for the loss of seagrass nurseries by colonizing habitats where seagrass has been eliminated by environmental stress, and (2) is utilized by juvenile blue crabs ( Callinectes sapidus ) as nursery habitat. We quantified Gracilaria presence, percent cover, and biomass as a function of region (upriver, midriver, and downriver) and seagrass presence or absence using stratified random sampling, 20-m transects, and 0.0625-m 2 quadrats. Gracilaria volume was measured and converted to dry weight. Effects of the factors and covariates temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, month, and year were analyzed using generalized linear models. Juvenile blue crab density was quantified in summer 2013 using suction sampling in Gracilaria and seagrass. A model with the collective effect of region and seagrass presence or absence (downriver seagrass, downriver unvegetated bottom, midriver unvegetated bottom) best predicted Gracilaria abundance. Gracilaria presence, percent cover, and biomass were highest in downriver seagrass, followed by downriver unvegetated bottom, and then midriver unvegetated bottom, where seagrass has been extirpated, supporting hypothesis (1). Gracilaria did not occur upriver, likely due to a lack of recruitment. Seagrass and Gracilaria housed similar densities of juvenile blue crabs, supporting hypothesis (2). We estimated that a single 40-ha cove system with Gracilaria could house 200,000 juvenile crabs as would a single 2.4-ha seagrass bed. Consequently, the numerous midriver and downriver cove systems in the York River could support millions of young juvenile blue crabs and thereby compensate for the loss of seagrass in the river and in other areas of Chesapeake Bay. At present, Gracilaria has no widespread negative impacts on seagrass in the York River or most regions of Chesapeake Bay, likely because percent cover and biomass are not excessively high at present. We posit that Gracilaria has become an important alternative nursery habitat for the blue crab in Chesapeake Bay and can potentially mitigate impacts of climate change on seagrass nursery habitats."
https://openalex.org/W4281712891,"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that generates amylopectin granules (AGs), a polysaccharide associated with bradyzoites that define chronic T. gondii infection. AGs are postulated to act as an essential energy storage molecule that enable bradyzoite persistence, transmission, and reactivation. Importantly, reactivation can result in the life-threatening symptoms of toxoplasmosis. T. gondii encodes glucan dikinase and glucan phosphatase enzymes that are homologous to the plant and animal enzymes involved in reversible glucan phosphorylation and which are required for efficient polysaccharide degradation and utilization. However, the structural determinants that regulate reversible glucan phosphorylation in T. gondii are unclear. Herein, we define key functional aspects of the T. gondii glucan phosphatase TgLaforin (TGME49_205290). We demonstrate that TgLaforin possesses an atypical split carbohydrate-binding-module domain. AlphaFold2 modeling combined with hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and differential scanning fluorimetry also demonstrate the unique structural dynamics of TgLaforin with regard to glucan binding. Moreover, we show that TgLaforin forms a dual specificity phosphatase domain-mediated dimer. Finally, the distinct properties of the glucan phosphatase catalytic domain were exploited to identify a small molecule inhibitor of TgLaforin catalytic activity. Together, these studies define a distinct mechanism of TgLaforin activity, opening up a new avenue of T. gondii bradyzoite biology as a therapeutic target."

To reduce this mortality, it is important to provide the recommended care during the perinatal period. We assessed the prevalence and factors associated with appropriate perinatal care (antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum) in Bunyoro region, Uganda. Results from this study provide valuable information on the perinatal care services and highlight areas of improvement for better perinatal outcomes.A cross sectional survey was conducted among postpartum mothers attending care at three district hospitals in Bunyoro. Following consent, a questionnaire was administered to capture the participants' demographics and data on care received was extracted from their antenatal, labour, delivery, and postpartum records using a pre-tested structured tool. The care received by women was assessed against the standard protocol established by World Health Organization (WHO). Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to assess factors associated with appropriate postpartum care.A total of 872 mothers receiving care at the participating hospitals between March and June 2020 were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the mothers was 25 years (SD = 5.95). None of the mothers received appropriate antenatal or intrapartum care, and only 3.8% of the participants received appropriate postpartum care. Factors significantly associated with appropriate postpartum care included mothers being >35 years of age (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 11.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8-51.4) and parity, with low parity (2-3) and multiparous (>3) mothers less likely to receive appropriate care than prime gravidas (aPR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9 and aPR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.8 respectively).Antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care received by mothers in this region remains below the standard recommended by WHO, and innovative strategies across the continuum of perinatal care need to be devised to prevent mortality among the mothers. The quality of care also needs to be balanced for all mothers irrespective of the age and parity."

While this is commonly regarded as a sign of incomplete cognitive development, a broader attentional focus could also endow children with the ability to find novel solutions to a given task. To test this idea, we investigated children’s ability to discover and use novel aspects of the environment that allowed them to improve their decision-making strategy. Participants were given a simple choice task in which the possibility of strategy improvement was neither mentioned by instructions nor encouraged by explicit error feedback. Among 47 children (8—10 years of age) who were instructed to perform the choice task across two experiments, 27.5% showed a full strategy change. This closely matched the proportion of adults who had the same insight (28.2% of n = 39). The amount of erroneous choices, working memory capacity and inhibitory control, in contrast, indicated substantial disadvantages of children in task execution and cognitive control. A task difficulty manipulation did not affect the results. The stark contrast between age-differences in different aspects of cognitive performance might offer a unique opportunity for educators in fostering learning in children."

The protocol described here outlines the methodology for a systematic review to explore how threats are theoretically and methodologically understood and used in conservation plans across freshwater, marine and terrestrial environments. Our primary research question is: how have threats informed conservation planning?

Although efforts to address this situation, including the 2016 peace agreement signed between Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC, by Spanish acronym) are underway, these disputes continue, affecting land use dynamics. Understanding the complexity and trends in land use conflicts, as well as the specific regional characteristics underlying differing land use changes across regions, is critical. This article aims to systematically understand land use dynamics in two contrasting and conflict-affected territories in Colombia, Caquetá and Cesar, thus identifying entry points to address land-use conflicts at the regional level. To address the complexity of each regional case, we apply a methodology based on system thinking to capture the interconnections between socio-economic and environmental system components and their land use dynamics. Results depicted through causal loop diagrams not just show the cascade of environmental, social, and economic failures resulting from land use changes in these two conflict-affected territories but also suggest that land tenure systems innovations and the promotion of sustainable land use interventions at the regional level can reverse the consequences of the land use changes. Thus, future actions addressing land use conflicts must be context-dependent, tackling the root and structural causes."

To determine how range use was correlated with different sunlight variables and weather factors, a study was carried out on three commercial free-range layer farms during the summer/autumn period (December-May) across diverse regions of Australia in Tasmania (TAS), Queensland (QLD), and Western Australia (WA). Hens’ range distribution was determined by counting the number of hens in the direct sunlight (‘sun’) or ‘cloud’ and shaded areas (‘sun-shade’ or ‘cloud-shade’, in sunny or cloudy conditions, respectively) using image snapshots taken at 30 min intervals from video recordings of a portion of one shed comprising 20,000–30,000 hens on each farm during the production phase of the laying cycle. The solar radiation spectrum [UV radiation (UV AB ) (288–432 nm), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; visible light) (400–700 nm), and total solar radiation (TSR) (285 nm-3000 nm)] and weather data (ambient temperature and relative humidity) were recorded through an on-site weather station. Data were analysed separately due to discrepancies between the farms’ layouts. The effects of time of day and months on range use were analysed using General Linear Models in JMP ® 16.0 and the relationship of sunlight and weather variables with hens’ distribution in ‘sun’/’sun-shade’ and ‘cloud’/’cloud-shade’ in sunny and cloudy conditions respectively was determined by fitting linear ridge regression models using the ‘lmridge’ package in R. Overall, the time of day and month had significant effects on hens’ distribution on the range (all p &lt; 0.0001). Hens’ range occupancy in the ‘sun’ decreased during the midday period with gradual increases in the late afternoon to evening, and the opposite pattern in the ‘sun-shade’. A linear increase in the number of hens on the range over the months indicated the seasonal effects on hen ranging patterns. Temperature, UV AB and PAR were the most important factors for discouraging hens’ range use in the ‘sun’ suggesting free-range systems in Australia should be designed to account for the extreme sunlight using adequate shade for optimum ranging across summer."
https://openalex.org/W4281556184,"Deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolases (dNTPases) are important enzymes that may perform multiple functions in the cell, including regulating the dNTP pools and contributing to innate immunity against viruses. Among the homologs that are best studied are human sterile alpha motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), a tetrameric dNTPase, and the hexameric Escherichia coli dGTPase; however, it is unclear whether these are representative of all dNTPases given their wide distribution throughout life. Here, we investigated a hexameric homolog from the marine bacterium Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis, revealing that it is a dGTPase that is subject to allosteric activation by dATP, specifically. Allosteric regulation mediated solely by dATP represents a novel regulatory feature among dNTPases that may facilitate maintenance of cellular dNTP pools in L. blandensis. We present high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures (1.80-2.26 Å) in catalytically important conformations as well as cryo-EM structures (2.1-2.7 Å) of the enzyme bound to dGTP and dATP ligands. The structures, the highest resolution cryo-EM structures of any SAMHD1-like dNTPase to date, reveal an intact metal-binding site with the dGTP substrate coordinated to three metal ions. These structural and biochemical data yield insights into the catalytic mechanism and support a conserved catalytic mechanism for the tetrameric and hexameric dNTPase homologs. We conclude that the allosteric activation by dATP appears to rely on structural connectivity between the allosteric and active sites, as opposed to the changes in oligomeric state upon ligand binding used by SAMHD1."

We investigated DBI-TSPO signaling and its correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), neurotrophic or inflammatory cytokines in neovascular retinopathy, and under hypoxic conditions. The vitreous expression of DBI, VEGF, nerve growth factor (NGF), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) were examined in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) patients with or without anti-VEGF therapy and nondiabetic controls. Retinal DBI-TSPO signaling and the effect of the anti-VEGF agent were evaluated in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Interactions between Müller cell-derived VEGF and DBI, as well as cocultured microglial cells under hypoxic conditions, were studied, using Western blot, real-time RT-PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and immunofluorescent labeling. Results showed that vitreous levels of DBI, VEGF, NGF, and IL-1β were significantly higher in PDR patients compared with controls, which further changed after anti-VEGF therapy. A statistical association was found between vitreous DBI and VEGF, NGF, IL-1β, and age. The application of the anti-VEGF agent in the OIR model induced retinal expression of DBI and NGF, and attenuated inflammation and microglial cell activation. Inhibition of Müller cell-derived VEGF could increase its DBI expression under hypoxic conditions, while the DBI-TSPO signaling pathway is essential for anti-VEGF agents exerting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, as well as limiting inflammatory magnitude, promoting its neurotrophin production and anti-inflammatory (M2) polarization in microglial cells. These findings suggest the beneficial effect of anti-VEGF therapy on inflammation and neurotrophy of retinal glial cells through modulation of the DBI-TSPO signaling pathway."

We sought to determine whether administration of Citicoline immediately after recanalization therapy for AIS would improve clinical and radiological outcome at three months compared to standard treatment alone.CAISR was a single centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial with blinded endpoint assessment. It was approved by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Institutional ethics committee and registered at the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2018/011900).

https://openalex.org/W4285743363,"Lipocalin-2 and visfatin are proinflammatory adipokines involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Their role has been described in numerous inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Recently, an increased prevalence of metabolic abnormalities has been reported in patients with alopecia areata. The aim of the study is to determine the serum levels of lipocalin-2 and visfatin in patients with alopecia areata in comparison with healthy controls. Moreover, the serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), triglycerides, fasting glucose, insulin, c-peptide, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were evaluated. Fifty-two patients with alopecia areata and 17 control subjects were enrolled in the study. The serum levels of lipocalin-2 [mean ± standard deviation, SD: 224.55 ± 53.58 ng/ml vs. 188.64 ± 44.75, p = 0.01], insulin [median (interquartile range, IQR): 6.85 (4.7–9.8) μIU/ml vs. 4.5 (3.5–6.6), p&lt;0.05], c-peptide [median (IQR): 1.63 (1.23–2.36) ng/ml vs. 1.37 (1.1–1.58), p&lt;0.05)], and HOMA-IR [median (IQR): 1.44 (0.98–2.15) vs. 0.92 (0.79–1.44), p&lt;0.05) were significantly higher in patients with alopecia areata compared to the controls. The serum concentration of insulin and HOMA-IR correlated with the number of hair loss episodes (r = 0.300, p&lt;0.05 and r = 0.322, p&lt;0.05, respectively). Moreover, a positive correlation occurred between insulin, HOMA-IR, c-peptide and BMI (r = 0.436, p &lt;0.05; r = 0.384, p&lt;0.05 and r = 0.450, p&lt;0.05, respectively). In conclusion, lipocalin-2 and insulin may serve as biomarkers for alopecia areata. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of insulin as a prognostic factor in alopecia areata."

https://openalex.org/W4285744484,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder caused by a mutation in the HBB gene leading to hemoglobin S production and polymerization under hypoxia conditions leading to vaso-occlusion, chronic hemolysis, and progressive organ damage. This disease affects ~100,000 people in the United States and millions worldwide. An effective therapy for SCD is fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction by pharmacologic agents such as hydroxyurea, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for this purpose. Therefore, the goal of our study was to determine whether salubrinal (SAL), a selective protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor, induces HbF expression through the stress-signaling pathway by activation of p-eIF2α and ATF4 trans-activation in the γ-globin gene promoter. Sickle erythroid progenitors treated with 24μM SAL increased F-cells levels 1.4-fold (p = 0.021) and produced an 80% decrease in reactive oxygen species. Western blot analysis showed SAL enhanced HbF protein by 1.6-fold (p = 0.0441), along with dose-dependent increases of p-eIF2α and ATF4 levels. Subsequent treatment of SCD mice by a single intraperitoneal injection of SAL (5mg/kg) produced peak plasma concentrations at 6 hours. Chronic treatments of SCD mice with SAL mediated a 2.3-fold increase in F-cells (p = 0.0013) and decreased sickle erythrocytes supporting in vivo HbF induction."
https://openalex.org/W4285744544,"Recent studies demonstrated a significant role of several microRNAs (miRs) in the development of leiomyoma. Here, we investigated miR expression profiles using microarray and found a significantly higher expression of miRs in leiomyoma than in adjacent myometrium. We also confirmed the upregulation of five selected miRs including miR-181a-5p, 127-3p, 28-3p, 30b-5p and let-7c-5p in cellular proliferation, extracellular matrix turnover, and angiogenesis by RT-qPCR. Interestingly, the miRs showed a higher expression in cases of large leiomyoma or in patients with a history of transfusion due to anemia. We then analyzed the expression of the miR target molecules including Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 2 (TGFBR2) and Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 mRNA Binding Protein 1 (IGF2BP1) via immunohistochemistry. TGFBR2 and IGF2BP1 were positively stained in 81% and 62.5% of leiomyoma tissues but not in adjacent myometrium. Both were more frequently positive in patients with ≥ 6 cm leiomyoma and mass effect. The mean expression levels of miR-181a-5p, 127-3p, 28-3p, 30b-5p and let-7c-5p were higher in cases with TGFBR2 and IGF2BP1 positive leiomyoma. We observed several miRs were overexpressed in leiomyoma tissues, and these results provide insight into the role of miRs in the development and progression of leiomyoma and underscore the need to validate their utility as diagnostic or therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W4285744916,"This study aimed to provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy of invasive laser acupuncture (ILA) for chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLBP). This was a single-center, randomized, patient and assessor-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, clinical trial with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio that included a full analysis set. Forty-five participants with CNLBP were randomly assigned to the control group (sham laser), 650 group (650 nm-wavelength ILA), or 830 group (830 nm-wavelength ILA) (n = 15/group). All participants received ILA for 10 min, followed by electroacupuncture for 10 min on the same day. The treatment was performed once per day, twice per week for 4 weeks at bilateral BL23, BL24, BL25, and GB30. The primary outcome was the among-group difference of changes in the visual analog scale (VAS) scores at intervention endpoint (week 4). The secondary outcomes were the among-group difference of changes in VAS at 4 weeks after intervention completion (week 8), those in the Korean version of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the European Quality of Life Five-Dimension- Five-Level (EQ-5D-5L) at intervention endpoint (week 4) and 4 weeks after intervention completion (week 8). The VAS scores of the 650 group decreased significantly compared with those of the control group (p = 0.047; week 4 vs. week 0). The ODI scores of the 650 group (p = 0.018, week 4 vs. week 0; p = 0.006, week 8 vs. week 0) and 830 group (p = 0.014, week 4 vs. week 0) decreased significantly compared with those of the control group. There was no adverse event related to ILA and no significant difference in changes in vital signs among the three groups. The 650 group showed significant improvements in pain intensity and functional disability. The 830 group showed significant improvements in functional disability. Therefore, ILA therapy at 650 nm and 830 nm wavelengths can be used to treat CNLBP."
https://openalex.org/W4281699881,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which poses a major threat to humans worldwide. With the continuous progress of the pandemic, a growing number of people are infected with SARS-CoV-2, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, the relationship between COVID-19 and HCC has not been fully elucidated. In order to provide better treatment for HCC patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it's urgently needed to identify common targets and find effective drugs for both. In our study, transcriptomic analysis was performed on both selected lung epithelial cell datasets of COVID-19 patients and the datasets of HCC patients to identify the synergistic effect of COVID-19 in HCC patients. What's more, common differentially expressed genes were identified, and a protein-protein interactions network was designed. Then, hub genes and basic modules were detected based on the protein-protein interactions network. Next, functional analysis was performed using gene ontology terminology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway. Finally, protein-protein interactions revealed COVID-19 interaction with key proteins associated with HCC and further identified transcription factor (TF) genes and microRNAs (miRNA) with differentially expressed gene interactions and transcription factor activity. This study reveals that COVID-19 and HCC are closely linked at the molecular level and proposes drugs that may play an important role in HCC patients with COVID-19. More importantly, according to the results of our research, two critical drugs, Ilomastat and Palmatine, may be effective for HCC patients with COVID-19, which provides clinicians with a novel therapeutic idea when facing possible complications in HCC patients with COVID-19."

Women were categorised according to BMI and DM status [pre-gestational (P-DM; n = 59), insulin managed (I-GDM; n = 132) and diet managed gestational diabetes (D-GDM; n = 29)]. Analysis of variance and linear regressions were applied.AFT and TFT did not differ significantly between BMI categories (normal, overweight and obese). In contrast, AFT was significantly higher in pregnancies affected by D-GDM compared to non-DM pregnancies from mid stage (0.44 mm difference, p = 0.002) and for all DM categories in late stage of adipogenesis (≥ 0.49 mm difference, p < 0.008). Late stage TFT accretion was higher than controls for P-DM and I-GDM but not for D-GDM (0.67 mm difference, p < 0.001; 0.49 mm difference, p = 0.001, 0.56 mm difference, p = 0.22 respectively). In comparison to the early non-DM group with an AFT to TFT ratio of 1.07, the I-GDM group ratio was 1.25 (p < 0.001), which normalised by 28 weeks becoming similar to control ratios.DM, independent of BMI, was associated with higher abdominal and mid-thigh fat accretion in fetuses. Use of insulin improved central to peripheral fat ratios in fetuses of GDM mothers."
https://openalex.org/W4281742512,"The Ups2-Mdm35 complex mediates intramitochondrial phosphatidylserine (PS) transport to facilitate mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis. In the present study, we found that ups2∆ yeast showed increased mitochondrial ATP production and enhanced quiescence (G0) entry in the post-diauxic shift phase. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses revealed that the depletion of Ups2 leads to overactivation of the yeast AMPK homolog Snf1. Inactivation of Snf1 by depletion of an Snf1-activating kinase, Sak1 canceled the changes in mitochondrial ATP production and quiescence entry observed in ups2∆ cells. Furthermore, among the factors regulated by Snf1, upregulation of pyruvate carboxylase, Pyc1 and downregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, Acc1, respectively, were sufficient to increase mitochondrial ATP production and quiescence entry. These results suggested that a normal PE synthesis mediated by Ups2-Mdm35 complex attenuates Snf1/AMPK activity, and that Snf1-mediated regulation of carbon metabolisms has great impacts on mitochondrial energy metabolism and quiescence entry. We also found that depletion of Ups2 together with the cell-cycle regulators Whi5 and Whi7, functional orthologs of the Rb1 tumor suppressor, caused a synthetic growth defect in yeast. Similarly, knockdown of PRELID3b, the human homolog of Ups2, decreased the viability of Rb1-deficient breast cancer cells, suggesting that PRELID3b is a potential target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4281790587,"Since Shannon's formulation of the entropy theory in 1940 and Jaynes' discovery of the principle of maximum entropy (POME) in 1950, entropy applications have proliferated across a wide range of different research areas including hydrological and environmental sciences. In addition to POME, the method of probability-weighted moments (PWM), was introduced and recommended as an alternative to classical moments. The PWM is thought to be less impacted by sampling variability and be more efficient at obtaining robust parameter estimates. To enhance the PWM, self-determined probability-weighted moments was introduced by (Haktanir 1997). In this article, we estimate the parameters of Kumaraswamy distribution using the previously mentioned methods. These methods are compared to two older methods, the maximum likelihood and the conventional method of moments techniques using Monte Carlo simulations. A numerical example based on real data is presented to illustrate the implementation of the proposed procedures."
https://openalex.org/W4281929062,"Odorant receptors (ORs) expressed in mammalian olfactory sensory neurons are essential for the sense of smell. However, structure–function studies of many ORs are hampered by unsuccessful heterologous expression. To understand and eventually overcome this bottleneck, we performed heterologous expression and functional assays of over 80 OR variants and chimeras. Combined with literature data and machine learning, we found that the transmembrane domain 4 (TM4) and its interactions with neighbor residues are important for OR functional expression. The data highlight critical roles of T4.62 therein. ORs that fail to reach the cell membrane can be rescued by modifications in TM4. Consequently, such modifications in MOR256-3 (Olfr124) also alter OR responses to odorants. T1614.62P causes the retention of MOR256-3 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while T1614.62P/T1484.49A reverses the retention and makes receptor trafficking to cell membrane. This study offers new clues toward wide-range functional studies of mammalian ORs."
https://openalex.org/W4281972407,"Structural discovery of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) protein complexes is likely to become increasingly relevant with the development of new therapeutics targeting small GTPases and development of new classes of small molecules that inhibit protein-protein interactions. Syx (also known as PLEKHG5 in humans) is a RhoA GEF implicated in the pathology of glioblastoma (GBM). Here we investigated protein expression and purification of ten different human Syx constructs and performed biophysical characterizations and computational studies that provide insights into why expression of this protein was previously intractable. We show that human Syx can be expressed and isolated and Syx is folded as observed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and actively binds to RhoA as determined by co-elution during size exclusion chromatography (SEC). This characterization may provide critical insights into the expression and purification of other recalcitrant members of the large class of oncogenic—Diffuse B-cell lymphoma (Dbl) homology GEF proteins. In addition, we performed detailed homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations on the surface of a physiologically realistic membrane. These simulations reveal novel insights into GEF activity and allosteric modulation by the plekstrin homology (PH) domain. These newly revealed interactions between the GEF PH domain and the membrane embedded region of RhoA support previously unexplained experimental findings regarding the allosteric effects of the PH domain from numerous activity studies of Dbl homology GEF proteins. This work establishes new hypotheses for structural interactivity and allosteric signal modulation in Dbl homology RhoGEFs."
https://openalex.org/W4285740287,"The corn leafhopper Dalbulus maidis is the main vector of the pathogens that cause corn stunt, a major disease of maize in the Americas. In line with plant resistance being an efficient tool to control diseases, the findings of a previous work showed that some corn hybrids are resistant to D. maidis. In this work, we assessed the probing behavior of D. maidis on susceptible and resistant corn hybrids using EPG (Electrical Penetration Graph) technology. Feeding of fifteen-day-old, non-inoculative females was recorded for 20 hours, with access to hybrids DK390, DK670, DK79-10, and DK72-10. Compared to the susceptible hybrid DK670, the other hybrids shifted D. maidis probing behavior in a way consistent with plant resistance to insects. This shift consisted of a higher number of probes of short duration, difficulties in attaining phloem ingestion and increase in xylem ingestion. In addition to this common shift in probing behavior, a phloem-located resistance factor was inferred in DK72-10 based on the longer time spent in phloem conditioning to attain phloem ingestion. In contrast, DK390 expressed the highest level of mesophyll and phloem-based resistance, in both cases seen with repeated attempts of short duration, a behavior typically associated with failed attempts to ingest. These findings support and are consistent with previous research, providing useful information to characterize maize hybrids resistant to D. maidis, and consequently to corn stunt."
https://openalex.org/W4285740555,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Therapies for glaucoma are directed toward reducing intraocular pressure (IOP), the leading risk factor and only reliable therapeutic target via topical medications or with procedural intervention including laser or surgery. Though topical therapeutics are typically first line, less than 50% of patients take drops as prescribed. Sustained release technologies that decrease IOP for extended periods of time are being examined for clinical use. We recently identified Stanniocalcin-1, a naturally occurring hormone, as an IOP-lowering agent. Here, we show that a single injection into the anterior chamber of mice with an adeno-associated viral vector containing the transgene of stanniocalcin-1 results in diffuse and sustained expression of the protein and produces IOP reduction for up to 6 months. As the treatment effect begins to wane, IOP-lowering can be rescued with a repeat injection. Aqueous humor dynamic studies revealed an increase in outflow facility as the mechanism of action. This first-in-class therapeutic approach has the potential to improve care and reduce the rates of vision loss in the 80 million people worldwide currently affected by glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W4285741151,"Background Every year, over 4 million children are treated for severe acute malnutrition with varying program performance. This study sought to explore the predictors of time to recovery from and non-response to outpatient treatment of SAM. Methods Children with weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) &lt;-3 and/or mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt;115 mm, without medical complications were enrolled in a trial (called MANGO) from outpatient clinics in Burkina Faso. Treatment included a weekly ration of ready-to-use therapeutic foods. Recovery was declared with WHZ ≥-2 and/or MUAC ≥125 mm, for two weeks without illness. Children not recovered by 16 weeks were considered as non-response to treatment. Predictors studied included admission characteristics, morbidity and compliance during treatment and household characteristics. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted and restricted mean time to recovery calculated. Logistic regression was used to analyse non-response to treatment. Results Fifty-five percent of children recovered and mean time to recovery was eight weeks while 13% ended as non-response to treatment. Independent predictors of longer time to recovery or non-response included low age, being admitted with WHZ &lt;-3, no illness nor anaemia at admission, illness episodes during treatment, skipped or missed visits, low maternal age and not practising open defecation. Eighty-four percent of children had at least one and 59% at least two illness episodes during treatment. This increased treatment duration by 1 to 4 weeks. Thirty-five percent of children missed at least one treatment visit. One missed visit predicted 3 weeks longer and two or more missed visits 5 weeks longer treatment duration. Conclusions Both longer time to recovery and higher non-response to treatment seem most strongly associated with illness episodes and missed visits during treatment. This indicates that prevention of illnesses would be key to shortening the treatment duration and that there is a need to seek ways to facilitate adherence."

A national cross-sectional survey was conducted in 77 hospitals across seven provinces in China between July 2014 and April 2015. Physician well-being was assessed with job satisfaction, career regret and happiness. Organizational behaviors were assessed with organizational fairness, leadership attention and team interaction; patient behaviors were assessed with patient trust and unreasonable requests from patients. Of a study sample of 3,159 physicians, 1,788 were men (56.6%) and 1,371 were women (43.4%). Overall, positive organizational and patient behaviors reported by physicians were relatively low. Negative organizational behaviors and patient behaviors including lower organizational fairness, lower leadership attention, lower team interaction and lower patient trust were associated with lower job satisfaction and lower life satisfaction, and higher career regret. The association between organizational behaviors and physician well-being exhibited some gender differences, while no clear gender difference was found for the relationship between patient behaviors and physician well-being. Given the importance of physician well-being for the healthcare system, interventions for improving internal and external hospital environments (e.g., organizational fairness, leadership attention, team interaction and patient trust) may benefit physician well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4285744412,"Positive and counter-selectable markers have been successfully integrated as a part of numerous genetic assays in many model organisms. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of resistance to arginine analog canavanine and its applicability for genetic selection in Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Deletion of both the arginine permease gene cat1 and SPBC18H10 . 16/vhc1 (formerly mistakenly called can1 ) provides strong drug resistance, while the single SPBC18H10 . 16/vhc1 deletion does not have an impact on canavanine resistance. Surprisingly, the widely used can1-1 allele does not encode for a defective arginine permease but rather corresponds to the any1-523C&gt;T allele. The strong canavanine-resistance conferred by this allele arises from an inability to deposit basic amino acid transporters on the cellular membrane. any1-523C&gt;T leads to reduced post-translational modifications of Any1 regulated by the Tor2 kinase. We also demonstrate that any1-523C&gt;T is a dominate allele. Our results uncover the mechanisms of canavanine-resistance in fission yeast and open the opportunity of using cat1 , vhc1 and any1 mutant alleles in genetic assays."

Traditional histogram equalization methods often lead to excessive enhancement and loss of details, thereby resulting in an unclear and unnatural appearance. In this method, the image is processed bidirectionally. On the one hand, the image is processed by double histogram equalization with double automatic platform method based on improved cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, where the image histogram is segmented firstly, and the platform limit is selected according to the histogram statistics and improved CS technology. Then, the sub-histograms are clipped by two platforms and carried out the histogram equalization respectively. Finally, an image with balanced brightness and good contrast can be obtained. On the other hand, the main structure of the image is extracted based on the total variation model, and the image mask with all the texture details is made by removing the main structure of the image. Eventually, the final enhanced image is obtained by adding the mask with texture details to the image with balanced brightness and good contrast. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the visual effect of the low-light images, based on human subjective evaluation and objective evaluation indices. Experimental results show that the proposed method in this paper is better than the existing methods."

In this study, we introduce a resource-efficient, Rosetta-based protocol named ""PlaceWaters"" to predict the location of explicit interface bridging waters during a ligand docking simulation. In contrast to other explicit water methods, this protocol is independent of knowledge of number and location of crystallographic waters in homologous structures. We test this method on a diverse protein-small molecule benchmark set in comparison to other Rosetta-based protocols. Our results suggest that this coarse-grained, structure-based approach quickly and accurately predicts the location of bridging waters, improving our ability to computationally screen drug candidates."

This study aimed to determine whether line orientations in the background of Chinese written characters influenced individual's memory and emotion. Five pictures with Chinese characters as experimental material, in which four had equidistant parallel lines (0°, -45°, 90°, and +45°) as background and the other one had a blank background, were presented on a personal computer screen, for 15 seconds each, to 94 participants. The participants were then given 45 seconds to write down what they had just memorized. Participants' emotion was identified by their Heart Rate Variability (HRV) simultaneously during the viewing process. The results showed that vertical (90°) and 45° leftward leaning lines (-45°) did not weaken users' memory, and no significant difference in memory was found between these two states and the blank background, while horizontal (0°) and 45° rightward leaning lines (+45°) weakened the memory effect significantly. Overall, memory decreased in the condition of horizontally lined background while no influence in vertically lined background condition; and it showed asymmetry under leftward and rightward leaning line conditions: memory decreased in rightward leaning lined background while no influence in leftward lined background. Moreover, the results of emotion and memory showed negative similar trend. These findings provide practical suggestions for visual information design."
https://openalex.org/W4285740607,"Risk factors for liver cancer include tobacco use, alcohol consumption, obesity, and male sex. Administration of 4-nitroquinonline-1-oxide (4NQO) in drinking water mimics the effects of tobacco and leads to oral carcinoma in mice. This study compared the effects of diets high and low in saturated fat (HF and LF, respectively), and sex, on liver histopathology in 4NQO-treated mice and controls. We hypothesized that 4NQO would cause histopathological changes in liver, and that a HF diet would increase hepatic pathology when compared to the LF diet. Mice (C57Bl/6, 36/sex), were divided into a low fat (10 kcal% fat; LF) or high fat (60 kcal% fat, HF) diet. Mice were further subdivided into one of 3 water treatment groups for 17 weeks: water (control), vehicle (1.25% propylene glycol in water [PG]), or 4NQO in (50 μg/ml; 4NQO). All mice were subsequently given water alone for 6 more weeks. Upon euthanasia, livers were harvested, fixed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). H&amp;E slides were graded for histopathology; frozen liver samples were analyzed for triglyceride content. Trichrome stained sections were graded for fibrosis. CD3+ T cells, CD68+ macrophages, and Ly6+ neutrophils were detected by immunohistochemistry. Compared to water controls, 4NQO-treatment caused mouse liver histopathological changes such as fibrosis, and increases in hepatic neutrophils, T cells, and macrophages. HF diet exacerbated pathological changes compared to LF diet. Male controls, but not females, demonstrated severe steatosis and increased triglyceride content. 4NQO treatment decreased hepatic fat accumulation, even in animals on a HF diet. In conclusion, this murine model of oral cancer may serve as a model to study the effects of tobacco and diet on liver."

With the upgrade of the task difficulty, the traditional 2d rectangular layout algorithm can no longer meet the needs of modern industry, such as express packing task and exoplanet ore collection task. The express or ore samples come in heterogeneous shapes so they cannot all be treated as rectangular pieces. In this paper, we propose a three-stage method called covering, corner-searching and occupying (C,S&O) to solve the two-dimensional multishape part packing problem. The objective of the packing problem variant is to ensure maximum use of the raw material and minimize the trim loss. The algorithm cannot make use of information about the sequence of future objects that are going to arrive, only knowing the shape and size of the coming one, and the coming part must be packed into the bin immediately after its arrival without buffering or readjusting. The method of C,S&O hybridizes the idea of ""gold corners, silver edges and grass belly"" in the Chinese game Go and the method of finding picture corners in machine vision. In the first stage, the rectangular bin and the coming part are transformed into matrix representation, and generating the position matrix that indicates possible ways of packing the part into the bin. In the second stage, the suitable layout position of the coming part is obtained using machine vision image processing technology for reference. The third stage is calculating the environment matching degree to determine the current optimal placement orientation. In order to facilitate the display of the simulation results, only three shapes of parts are considered in the simulation, rectangle, circle and triangle. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this method. Consulting the literature, it is found that this paper is the first to propose a layout method for multishape manufacturing parts."
