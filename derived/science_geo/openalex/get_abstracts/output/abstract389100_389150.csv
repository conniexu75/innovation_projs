https://openalex.org/W2057802075,"Metastasis is a defining feature of malignant tumors and is the most common cause of cancer-related death, yet the genetics of metastasis are poorly understood. We used exome capture coupled with massively parallel sequencing to search for metastasis-related mutations in highly metastatic uveal melanomas of the eye. Inactivating somatic mutations were identified in the gene encoding BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) on chromosome 3p21.1 in 26 of 31 (84%) metastasizing tumors, including 15 mutations causing premature protein termination and 5 affecting its ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase domain. One tumor harbored a frameshift mutation that was germline in origin, thus representing a susceptibility allele. These findings implicate loss of BAP1 in uveal melanoma metastasis and suggest that the BAP1 pathway may be a valuable therapeutic target."

To define host genetic effects on the outcome of a chronic viral infection, we performed genome-wide association analysis in a multiethnic cohort of HIV-1 controllers and progressors, and we analyzed the effects of individual amino acids within the classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins. We identified >300 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MHC and none elsewhere. Specific amino acids in the HLA-B peptide binding groove, as well as an independent HLA-C effect, explain the SNP associations and reconcile both protective and risk HLA alleles. These results implicate the nature of the HLA-viral peptide interaction as the major factor modulating durable control of HIV infection."

A stromal cell type that was first identified in human cancers expresses fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP). We created a transgenic mouse in which FAP-expressing cells can be ablated. Depletion of FAP-expressing cells, which made up only 2% of all tumor cells in established Lewis lung carcinomas, caused rapid hypoxic necrosis of both cancer and stromal cells in immunogenic tumors by a process involving interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. Depleting FAP-expressing cells in a subcutaneous model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma also permitted immunological control of growth. Therefore, FAP-expressing cells are a nonredundant, immune-suppressive component of the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2140145798,"Blocking Interfering Microbes Irinotecan is a widely used anticancer pro-drug that is converted in the liver into the active form, but when it gets into the gut, the normally benign microbial flora can convert it into the toxic form, which kills the rapidly multiplying gut epithelium as it would kill rapidly dividing tumor cells, and thus causes diarrhea. Wallace et al. (p. 831 ; see the Perspective by Patel and Kaufmann ) used high-throughput screening to identify inhibitors that target the offending bacterial enzyme, β-glucuronidase, without killing the bacteria or affecting orthologous mammalian enzymes. Crystal structures revealed the molecular basis of selectivity, and in vivo studies showed that an inhibitor protected mice from irinotecan-induced toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2036149681,"Toroidal multipoles are fundamental electromagnetic excitations different from those associated with the familiar charge and magnetic multipoles. They have been held responsible for parity violation in nuclear and particle physics, but direct evidence of their existence in classical electrodynamics has remained elusive. We report on the observation of a resonant electromagnetic response in an artificially engineered medium, or metamaterial, that cannot be attributed to magnetic or charge multipoles and can only be explained by the existence of a toroidal dipole. Our direct experimental evidence of the toroidal response brings attention to the often ignored electromagnetic interactions involving toroidal multipoles, which could be present in naturally occurring systems, especially at the macromolecule level, where toroidal symmetry is ubiquitous."
https://openalex.org/W2038032054,"Tuned for Faces The temporal lobe of macaques' brains contains six patches of face-selective cortex. This observation has prompted systems neuroscientists to ask, why so many and what do they do? Freiwald and Tsao (p. 845 ; see the Perspective by Connor ) targeted four of these regions for single-unit recordings and found that the different face-selective patches in macaques have independent functions. The areas where earliest processing occurred were most sharply tuned for individual views and least sharply tuned for identity. The mid-level area was more sharply tuned for identity, and the highest processing stage was strongly tuned for identity in a strikingly view-invariant way. These results yield fundamental insights into the computational process of object recognition, the functional organization of the brain, and how representations are transformed through processing hierarchies."

https://openalex.org/W1967443709,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is associated with a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Although TDP-43 resembles heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, its RNA targets and physiological protein partners remain unknown. Here we identify RNA targets of TDP-43 from cortical neurons by RNA immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (RIP-seq). The canonical TDP-43 binding site (TG)n is 55.1-fold enriched, and moreover, a variant with adenine in the middle, (TG)nTA(TG)m, is highly abundant among reads in our TDP-43 RIP-seq library. TDP-43 RNA targets can be divided into three different groups: those primarily binding in introns, in exons, and across both introns and exons. TDP-43 RNA targets are particularly enriched for Gene Ontology terms related to synaptic function, RNA metabolism, and neuronal development. Furthermore, TDP-43 binds to a number of RNAs encoding for proteins implicated in neurodegeneration, including TDP-43 itself, FUS/TLS, progranulin, Tau, and ataxin 1 and -2. We also identify 25 proteins that co-purify with TDP-43 from rodent brain nuclear extracts. Prominent among them are nuclear proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing and RNA stability and transport. Also notable are two neuron-enriched proteins, methyl CpG-binding protein 2 and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2). A PTBP2 consensus RNA binding motif is enriched in the TDP-43 RIP-seq library, suggesting that PTBP2 may co-regulate TDP-43 RNA targets. This work thus reveals the protein and RNA components of the TDP-43-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes and provides a framework for understanding how dysregulation of TDP-43 in RNA metabolism contributes to neurodegeneration.

Gene expression is an essential process common to all living organisms. Regulation of genes in mammals can occur by repression or activation at transcription promoter sites or by regulating aspects of RNA metabolism (1Keene J.D. Nat. Rev.

TDP-43 is part of the family of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), containing two highly conserved RNA recognition motifs and a non-conserved C-terminal region that mediates protein-protein interactions (11Buratti E. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36337-36343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in gene transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, and mRNA transport (12Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). TDP-43 was shown to have high binding affinity for the (TG)n motif (13Buratti E. Dörk T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M.

In addition, TDP-43 has been implicated in regulation of mRNA biogenesis (16Strong M.J. Volkening K. Hammond R. Yang W. Strong W. Leystra-Lantz C. Shoesmith C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 35: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and shown to be localized to sites of mRNA transcription and processing in neurons (17Casafont I. Bengoechea R. Tapia O.

Baralle F. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2268-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). TDP-43 is one of ∼600 annotated and predicted RNA-binding proteins that function in multiprotein complexes, working in cooperation to perform a collective function in RNA metabolism to regulate protein-coding genes. The constitutions of many RNA-binding protein complexes and their RNA targets are not well characterized, nor is the site specificity of these complexes for their RNA targets known. These questions can now be answered due to recent advances in proteomics, functional genomics, and high throughput sequencing. This study aims to identify the native protein constituents of TDP-43-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes and their RNA targets in neural cells. We performed a proteomic analysis on proteins co-purified with TDP-43 from brain nuclear extracts and determined that TDP-43 is in complexes with 25 endogenous nuclear proteins, mostly RNA-binding proteins and splicing factors. Notable among them are neural proteins methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2). In parallel, we used RIP-seq and a bioinformatics approach, which included producing our own mappability track for calculating density reads within each gene, to identify and analyze novel, in vivo TDP-43 RNA targets. We found that TDP-43 binds predominantly to RNAs containing the consensus motif (UG)n. Moreover, our analysis shows that there is often an adenine in the middle of the motif, (UG)nUA(UG)m. (Because our TDP-43 library generated for deep sequencing is composed of cDNAs that are then mapped to the rat genome, for simplicity, we will use TG instead of UG in describing TDP-43 targets in the rest of the text.) We also demonstrated that our TDP-43 library is significantly enriched in reads containing a PTBP2 consensus motif, suggesting that PTBP2 may co-regulate TDP-43 RNA targets. This work thus reveals the nuclear components of the TDP-43-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes and provides a framework for understanding the neuronal function of TDP-43 and its contribution to neurodegenerative disorders. Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were reagent-grade and were as indicated in the following sections. TDP-43 was detected with antibodies 748C (9Sephton C.F. Good S.K.

Mice on a mixed background (ages ∼3–5 months) were sacrificed, and brains were harvested. Mouse brains were added to homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 1× protease inhibitors) (Roche Diagnostics) and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in nuclear isolation buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.42 m sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitors), added to Beckman centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged in a SW 45 Ti rotor at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The nuclear pellet (P100) was suspended in NT2 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitors). Precleared nuclear extracts were applied to the AminoLink Plus resin (Pierce) cross-linked with either nonspecific rabbit IgG or TDP-43(748C) antibodies. Briefly, antibodies were diluted in coupling buffer (0.1 m Na3C6H5O7 and 0.05 m Na2CO3, pH 10) and coupled to the resin. Antibodies were then cross-linked to the resin, using 0.1 m NaBH3CN. Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C and eluted with 50 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and eluents were neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. HeLa nuclear lysates were untreated or pretreated with RNase A (Roche Diagnostics) and rat brain nuclear lysates were untreated or pretreated with micrococcal nuclease before they were loaded into a Superose 6 or Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare), respectively, in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.5. The collected fractions were used for Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation eluates were desalted via loading and briefly resolving protein bands in a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel. After staining with Coomassie Blue, each gel lane was cut into a band, and bands were subjected to in-gel digestion (12.5 μg/ml trypsin). Extracted peptides were loaded onto a C18 column (100-μm internal diameter, 12 cm long, ∼300 nl/min flow rate, 5 μm, 200 Å pore size resin from Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) and eluted during a 10–30% gradient (Buffer A, 0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, and 5% acetonitrile; Buffer B, 0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, and 95% acetonitrile) for 90 min (Experiment Sample 1) or 30 min (Experiment Sample 2). The eluted peptides were detected by Orbitrap (350–1500 m/z, 1,000,000 automatic gating control target, 1,000-ms maximum ion time, resolution 30,000 full width at half maximum) followed by 9–10 data-dependent MS/MS scans in linear trap quadrupole (2 m/z isolation width, 35% collision energy, 5,000 automatic gating control target, 200-ms maximum ion time) on a hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). Acquired MS/MS spectra were extracted and searched against a mouse reference database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the SEQUEST Sorcerer algorithm (version 2.0, SAGE-N). Searching parameters included mass tolerance of precursor ions (±50 ppm) and product ion (±0.5 m/z), partial tryptic restriction, with a dynamic mass shift for oxidized Met (+15.9949), four maximal modification sites, and three maximal missed cleavages. Only b and y ions were considered during the database match. To evaluate false discovery rate, all original protein sequences were reversed to generate a decoy database that was concatenated to the original database. The false discovery rate was estimated by the number of decoy matches (nd) and the total number of assigned matches (na). False discovery rate = 2 × nd/na, assuming the mismatches in the original database were the same as in the decoy database. To remove false positive matches, assigned peptides were grouped by a combination of trypticity (fully, partial, and non-tryptic) and precursor ion charge state (1+, 2+, and 3+). Considering shift from expected precursor m/z (<10 ppm) and by dynamically increasing XCorr (minimal 1.8) and ΔCn (minimal 0.05) values, protein false discovery rate was reduced to less than 5% (and less than 3% for proteins identified by a single peptide match). Proteins were quantified using the Abundance Index, which is defined as the spectral counts divided by the number of peptides per protein (19Zhang Y. Wen Z. Washburn M.P. Florens L. Anal Chem. 2009; 81: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Ishihama Y. Oda Y. Tabata T. Sato T. Nagasu T. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Mol. Cell.

Rat cortical neurons (14 days in vitro) were isolated from embryonic day 18 rat brains and cultured as described previously (9Sephton C.F. Good S.K. Atkin S. Dewey C.M. Mayer 3rd, P. Herz J. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6826-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed with PBS, lysed using polysomal lysis buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,10 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 100 units ml−1 RNase Out, 400 μm vanadyl ribonucleoside complexes, 1× protease inhibitors), and sonicated using a Biorupter® UCD200 to fragment the RNA (30 s on, 30 s off, repeated three times), and then lysates were precleared. Supernatants were diluted 10-fold in NT2 buffer (supplemented with 200 units ml−1 RNase Out, 400 μm vanadyl ribonucleoside complexes, 20 mm EDTA) and added to antibody-protein A beads. Both TDP-43 and nonspecific rabbit IgG antibodies were affinity-purified using protein A beads. Immunoprecipitation occurred for 2 h. Beads were washed with ice-cold NT2 buffer before eluting the RNP components and RNA with the addition of RNA-Stat60. The aqueous phase was separated by adding chloroform, and RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase using 70% ethanol. Isolated RNA was treated with DNase I to remove any genomic DNA contamination. The cDNA libraries were generated as per the Illumina manufacturer's instructions accompanying the RNA sample kit (part number 1004898). Briefly, the isolated RNA was fragmented using the provided fragmentation buffer, and first strand cDNA was generated using SuperScript II followed by second strand synthesis using DNA polymerase I. The cDNA was end-repaired using a combination of T4 DNA polymerase, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I large fragment (Klenow polymerase), and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow fragment (3′ to 5′ exonuclease-minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3-A base for ligation of the Illumina adapters, which have a single T base overhang at the 3′ end. After adapter ligation, cDNA was PCR-amplified with Illumina primers for 15 cycles, and library fragments of ∼250 bp (insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences) were band-isolated from an agarose gel. The purified cDNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina GA IIx genome analyzer following the manufacturer's protocols. The rat genome (build rn4) was downloaded from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (21Rhead B. Karolchik D. Kuhn R.M. Hinrichs A.S. Zweig A.S. Fujita P.A. Diekhans M.

Acids Res. 2010; 38: D613-D619Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) in May 2010. We used the RefSeq annotations (22Pruitt K.D. Tatusova T. Maglott D.R. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2007; 35: D61-D65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar) for rat and downloaded the associated table from the UCSC Genome Browser in May 2010. 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR, and coding region as well as intron and exon definitions were based on this RefSeq annotation. The read lengths from both TDP-43 and control libraries were 36 nt (nucleotides) long. These reads were mapped to the rat genome using the Bowtie software (23Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Genome. Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15054) Google Scholar). To ensure that the highest possible coverage was obtained, the reads were first truncated 1 nt at a time so that the length range was 12–36 nt, yielding a total of 24 different search files. Next, the error rates were compared in mapping with 0–3 mismatches. It was found that using the whole length of the reads (36 nt) allowing two mismatches gave the best trade-off between coverage and mapping accuracy (supplemental Fig. S1). Given the nature of the sequencing protocol, it was not possible to differentiate between reads coming from the two different strands. Using the mapped Bowtie output, the number of reads that map to a particular region (intron/exon, 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR, coding sequence) of each gene was calculated. The number of reads that map to a particular gene is strongly correlated with its length. Furthermore, due to shared/repetitive sequences between genes, not all 36-nt reads can be mapped uniquely to the genome. Therefore, it is not enough to simply divide the number of uniquely mapped reads by the total length of the gene to calculate the density of reads per unit sequence length. Currently, there is no existing information about how mappable a given sequence is for the rat genome, so we generated our own mappability track for the accurate calculation of the density of reads within each gene. For every position in the rat genome, we took 36 nt starting at that nucleotide and mapped this sequence using the Bowtie software back to the rat genome, allowing no mismatches. We assigned a mappability score of 1 if this sequence was the only instance in the genome. Otherwise, we assigned a mappability score of 0. Finally, we defined the effective length of a region as the sum of mappability scores of all positions in that region. One way to identify common short sequences that are preferentially bound by TDP-43 is to search for sequence fragments that are enriched in the TDP-43 library when compared with the control library. To determine how many times a short sequence appears in the TDP-43 library, we first found all possible 12-nt sequence fragments by shifting one nucleotide at a time to produce 24-fragments from each 36-nt read in the library. For each read, the same 12-nt sequence could appear more than once. In these cases, we only counted a single occurrence of these 12 nt. Due to the high computational cost of this operation, we decided to use a randomly selected subset of ∼10 million reads from the TDP-43 library. After ranking the 12-nt sequences by the number of occurrences among these reads, we took the most frequent 100 fragments, and we counted the total number of occurrences of only these sequences in both the entire TDP-43 and the control libraries. The -fold enrichment is calculated using Fisher's exact test. Because we used the same dataset to generate and test our hypothesis, we corrected for the multiple hypotheses testing problem using Bonferroni correction. We multiplied our p values by 4–12 to obtain the adjusted p values. For each gene, we first determined the number of reads mapping to its exons and introns and calculated the total intronic and exonic effective length of all genes. Then, we defined the exonic read density of each gene as equal to the number of reads mapped to its exons divided by its total exonic effective length. We also calculated intronic read density analogously. Using the reads from the TDP-43 library, we ranked all RefSeq genes based on either exonic or intronic read density, obtaining two separate ranked lists. Then, for each of these genes, we calculated the ratio of exonic and intronic read densities in the TDP-43 library to the control library. The top 25% genes from these lists were analyzed further after filtering out genes for which the ratio of read density between the TDP-43 sample and the control library was less than the ratio of total number of reads in the TDP-43 library to that in the control library (1.0547). This filter eliminated more genes from the exonic set than the intronic set. Among the filtered out genes were highly abundant transcripts. We defined three groups within TDP-43 targets. The “exonic targets” of TDP-43 were genes that ranked in the top 25% in exonic read density and had at least 1.0547-fold more exonic reads in the TDP-43 library when compared with the control library. The “intronic targets” of TDP-43 were defined similarly. The genes that appeared in the top 25% of both exonic and intronic read density and had a greater than 1.0547-fold difference in both exonic and intronic ratio of TDP-43 reads to control were defined as the set of “dual targets.” For a summary of the computational analysis of the libraries, see supplemental Fig. S2. The functional analysis of TDP-43 targets was performed using the FuncAssociate software (24Berriz G.F. King O.D. Bryant B. Sander C. Roth F.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2502-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 25Berriz G.F. Beaver J.E. Cenik C. Tasan M. Roth F.P. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 3043-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, enrichment for each Gene Ontology classification was calculated using Fisher's exact test. The p values were adjusted for the multiple hypotheses testing problem using a resampling approach (24Berriz G.F. King O.D. Bryant B. Sander C. Roth F.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2502-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We specified the set of all RefSeq IDs as the universe of all genes unless otherwise specified. All other statistical analyses were carried out using the R 2.9 software package. We searched the TDP-43 library for the consensus binding motifs and their reverse complements of PTPB2 (CTCTCTCTCTCT), hnRNP-A2/B1 (TTAGGGTTAGGG), and hnRNPC (CTTTACATTTG) and as a negative control PPARγ (AGGTCAXAGGTCA). We compared the number of occurrences of these motifs in the TDP-43 library with the control one to determine -fold enrichment. We first determined the native state of TDP-43 in HeLa nuclear extracts using gel filtration. We found that TDP-43 elutes in a high molecular mass range with a peak elution at >500 kDa and less prominently in a lower molecular mass range (Fig. 1A). We show that with the addition of RNase A, TDP-43 elution in the high molecular mass range could be shifted to the lower molecular mass range (Fig. 1A). A similar pattern was observed for hnRNPA1 in control lysates as well as lysates treated with RNase A but not for lamin A/C (Fig. 1A). We noticed that nuclease treatment resulted in the presence of ∼35- and ∼25-kDa TDP-43 bands, which are thought to be associated with neuropathology. To test whether TDP-43 exists in high molecular mass complexes in the brain, we took rat brain nuclear extracts and applied the extracts to a gel filtration column. Similar trends were observed as in HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 1B). TDP-43 elution in a lower molecular mass range of ∼100 kDa probably reflects a TDP-43 dimer (Fig. 1, A and B) (26Kuo P.H. Doudeva L.G. Wang Y.T. Shen C.K. Yuan H.S. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The observation that TDP-43 prominently exists in high molecular mass complexes (which probably are functional units) is consistent with the association of TDP-43 with RNAs. Native TDP-43 RNA targets in neurons have not been identified. To identify RNAs associating with TDP-43, we used a modified RNA immunoprecipitation method followed by deep sequencing (RIP-seq) (27Keene J.D. Komisarow J.M. Friedersdorf M.B. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) from primary cultured rat cortical neurons (Fig. 1C). We obtained 30.6 and 28.9 million 36-nt reads from the TDP-43 and control libraries, respectively. Of these, 47.1% (TDP-43) and 17.7% (control) mapped uniquely to the rat genome (build rn4), respectively. This 2.75-fold difference in mappability between the two libraries indicates that the TDP-43 library was enriched for regions of high sequence complexity. Consistent with this, 7.98 million reads in the TDP-43 library mapped uniquely to annotated RefSeq genes versus only 1.97 million reads from the control library (supplemental Data Files S1 and S2). In our TDP-43 library, 1.33 million reads mapped to exonic regions of genes versus 6.65 million reads to intronic regions (Fig. 1D). We calculated read densities (number of reads per 1,000 mappable nucleotides per million reads (mRPKM)), which takes into account differences in lengths of various regions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Within exons, TDP-43 reads exhibited 2.2 and 2.3 times higher read density in 3′-UTRs when compared with 5′-UTRs or open reading frames (coding sequence), respectively (Fig. 1E). This suggests that TDP-43 binding sites are enriched within 3′-UTRs. Interestingly, we observed several cases where TDP-43 reads extended beyond the annotated 3′-UTR end (data not shown), suggesting that several of these genes might have alternative isoforms in which use of distal polyadenylation sites results in longer 3′-UTRs. This is consistent with previous analyses suggesting that in differentiated tissues, genes tend to have longer 3′-UTRs (28Sandberg R. Neilson J.R. Sarma A. Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Science. 2008; 320: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). With regard to reads mapping to introns, we did not find any overall bias in the distribution of reads (8.33 × 10−7, 6.94 × 10−7, and 8.33 × 10−7, for coding sequence intron, 3′-UTR intron, and 5′-UTR intron read density, respectively). We then undertook an unbiased search for frequent short sequences in our TDP-43 library (see “Experimental Procedures”). Given our sequencing procedure, it was not possible to differentiate between the sense and antisense strands (for example, (TG)6 and (AC)6 were considered as a single motif). We discovered (TG)6 with its reverse complement (AC)6 to be the most frequent 12-nt sequence in our TDP-43 library such that 1.30 million reads contain one or the other. The number of these sequences in TDP-43 showed a remarkable 55.1-fold enrichment when compared with the control library (Fisher's exact test; adjusted p value < 3.4 × 10−8). Previously, TDP-43 was suggested to bind to TG repeats, which is in agreement with our analysis. More surprisingly, we found motifs of class (TG)nTA(TG)m (and their reverse complement) to be highly"

They can be detected because the dust absorbs the light from stars and reemits it at longer wavelengths. Their properties are still difficult to ascertain, however, because the combination of interference from dust and the low spatial resolution of submillimeter telescopes prevents further study at other wavelengths. Using data from the Herschel Space Telescope, Negrello et al. (p. 800 ) showed that by searching for the brightest sources in a wide enough area in the sky it was possible to detect gravitationally lensed submillimeter galaxies with nearly full efficiency. Gravitational lensing occurs when the light of an astronomical object is deflected by a foreground mass. This phenomenon increases the apparent brightness and angular size of the lensed objects, making it easier to study sources that would be otherwise too faint to probe."

Despite the wealth of structural data confirming the processive mode of action, little quantitative information on the processivity of CBHs is available. Here, we developed a method for measuring cellulase processivity. Sensitive fluorescence detection of enzyme-generated insoluble reducing groups on cellulose after labeling with diaminopyridine enabled quantification of the number of reducing-end exo-mode and endo-mode initiations. Both CBHs TrCel7A from Trichoderma reesei and PcCel7D from Phanerochaete chrysosporium employed reducing-end exo- and endo-mode initiation in parallel. Processivity values measured for TrCel7A and PcCel7D on cellulose hydrolysis were more than an order of magnitude lower than the values of intrinsic processivity that were found from the ratio of catalytic constant (k(cat)) and dissociation rate constant (k(off)). We propose that the length of the obstacle-free path available for a processive run on cellulose chain limits the processivity of CBHs on cellulose. TrCel7A and PcCel7D differed in their k(off) values, whereas the k(cat) values were similar. Furthermore, the k(off) values for endoglucanases (EGs) were much higher than the k(off) values for CBHs, whereas the k(cat) values for EGs and CBHs were within the same order of magnitude. These results suggest that the value of k(off) may be the primary target for the selection of cellulases."

https://openalex.org/W2049230124,"The NALP3 inflammasome is activated by low intracellular potassium concentrations [K(+)](i), leading to the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. However, the mechanism of [K(+)](i) lowering after phagocytosis of monosodium urate crystals is still elusive. Here, we propose that endosomes containing monosodium urate crystals fuse with acidic lysosomes. The low pH in the phagolysosome causes a massive release of sodium and raises the intracellular osmolarity. This process is balanced by passive water influx through aquaporins leading to cell swelling. This process dilutes [K(+)](i) to values below the threshold of 90 mm known to activate NALP3 inflammasomes without net loss of cytoplasmic potassium ions. In vitro, the inhibitors of lysosomal acidification (ammonium chloride, chloroquine) and of aquaporins (mercury chloride, phloretin) all significantly decreased the production of IL-1β. In vivo, only the pharmacological inhibitor of lysosome acidification chloroquine could be used which again significantly reduced the IL-1β production. As a translational aspect one may consider the use of chloroquine for the anti-inflammatory treatment of refractory gout."

Using purified murine T cells and the Il2 target locus, and a colon cancer cell line and the Cdx2 target locus, we show that Oct1 recruits the NuRD chromatin-remodeling complex to promote a repressed state, but in a regulated manner can switch to a different capacity and mediate Jmjd1a recruitment to block repression. These findings indicate that Oct1 maintains repression through a mechanism involving NuRD and maintains poised gene expression states through an antirepression mechanism involving Jmjd1a.

Oct1/POU2F1 is related to Oct4 and possesses similar in vitro DNA binding specificity (for reviewed, see Ref. 6Kang J. Shakya A. Tantin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 491-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As with many transcription factors, these proteins are known to regulate gene expression both positively and negatively (e.g. 7Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P.

Chem. 2007; 282: 8424-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, their activity has been thought to be determined by gene context and not subject to regulation.Loss of Oct1 inhibits oncogenic transformation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and tumorigenicity in p53-deficient mice and xenograft assays, while having little effect on cell growth in culture or transformation by serial passage (9Shakya A. Cooksey R. Cox J.E. Wang V. McClain D.A. Tantin D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One study indicates that Oct1 levels are increased in some human gastric cancers (10Almeida R. Almeida J. Shoshkes M. Mendes N. Mesquita P. Silva E. Van Seuningen I. Reis C.A. Santos-Silva F.

In contrast, multiple studies have identified coordinate up-regulation of Oct1 target genes in lung and breast adenocarcinomas, leukemias, and myeloid leukemia stem cells, without concurrent up-regulation of Oct1 itself (11Reymann S.

Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that Oct1 activity may be deregulated in malignancy. Recent findings showing post-translational regulation of Oct1 support this possibility (15Kang J. Gemberling M. Nakamura M. Whitby F.G. Handa H. Fairbrother W.G. Tantin D. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 208-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although Oct1 has been studied intensively, our current understanding of how it regulates gene transcription is surprisingly limited (see for example, Ref. 16Bertolino E. Singh H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Here, we show using three different systems (fibroblasts, primary T cells, and a colon cancer cell line) that Oct1 is a bipotential and switchable transcriptional regulator. In fibroblasts, Oct1 mediates recruitment of the Jmjd1a histone demethylase to target genes (Polr2a and Ahcy) following oxidative stress exposure. In the absence of Oct1, Jmjd1a fails to be recruited, H3K9me2 levels are elevated, and inappropriate repression is observed. In contrast, Oct1 recruits the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD/Mi-2) chromatin remodeling complex to the Il2 promoter in naïve CD4 T cells to mediate gene repression. The recruitment is regulated because upon T cell activation Oct1 loses its capacity to associate with NuRD and instead is required for recruitment of Jmjd1a. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment is sufficient to switch association from NuRD to Jmjd1a, despite the fact that PMA is insufficient to activate Il2. In resting but previously stimulated T cells, Oct1 is required to maintain Jmjd1a at Il2, remove histone H3K9me2 marks and protect DNA from methylation, promoting the stronger expression associated with secondary stimulation. In DLD-1 colon adenocarcinoma cells, Oct1 bound to the Cdx2 target locus is required for mutually exclusive NuRD and Jmjd1a association. PMA treatment of DLD-1 cells results in reduced Jmjd1a association and represses Cdx2 in a manner requiring Oct1. These results show that Oct1 is a bipotential factor capable of acting through opposing mechanisms to reinforce repressed or inducible states, even at the same target gene.DISCUSSIONHere, we show that Oct1 is a bipotential transcription factor capable of regulated switching between repressive and antirepressive modes. Our data are consistent with the model shown in Fig. 6. Oct1 mediates antirepression at two housekeeping targets (Polr2a and Ahcy) by enabling the recruitment of Jmjd1a and maintaining chromatin free of histone H3K9me2. At the regulated Il2 target locus promoter region, Oct1 mediates recruitment of the NuRD corepressor complex in naïve T cells and recruitment of Jmjd1a in previously activated, resting T cells. When naïve cells are stimulated, Oct1 becomes modified through mechanisms involving MAPK and ERK signaling such that it no longer recruits NuRD and instead, directly or indirectly recruits Jmjd1a. We detected a biochemical interaction between Oct1 and NuRD, but have thus far failed to detect Jmjd1a. Therefore we cannot eliminate the possibility that the association with Jmjd1a is indirect. MAPK signaling is attenuated after the T cell stimulus is removed; however, the antirepressive state is retained even after 8 days in culture without stimulation. Therefore, the modification(s) induced by MAPK signals are either stable, or some other activity (e.g. the induction of Oct1 cofactors) maintains the switched state over longer times. This state allows faster Il2 induction in rested T cells relative to naïve cells and may be constitutive at Polr2a and Ahcy, allowing gene expression to recover more rapidly in wild-type fibroblasts relative to Oct1-deficient fibroblasts following stress exposure.Oct1 also mediates recruitment of NuRD and Jmjd1a and is important for PMA-mediated gene regulation at the Cdx2 Oct1 target locus in DLD-1 cells. Also as with T cells, loss of Oct1 superficially appears to affect Cdx2 expression minimally; however, upon more careful examination Oct1 is critical for correct regulation. Several differences were also noted between the DLD-1 and T cell system. First, PMA mediates transcriptional silencing rather than transcriptional activation. Second, Oct1 is required for regulation by PMA. Third, both NuRD and Jmjd1a were detected in normally cultured cells as measured by ChIP. Sequential ChIP assays failed to detect any co-binding of the two activities, suggesting that DLD-1 cells are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of Oct1 associated with the different activities. Cumulatively, these findings suggest that Oct1 stabilizes both repressed and inducible transcriptional states. This bipotential form of transcription factor regulation has been associated with other transcription factor classes. For example, thyroid hormone receptor can switch from an activator to a repressor of the same targets in a ligand-regulated manner. This switch is mediated by exchange of coactivators and corepressors, including remodeling enzymes such as NuRD (35Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Côté J. Wang W. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).Chromatin-modifying complexes are central regulators of gene expression (22Jenuwein T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3121-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 52Denslow S.A. Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5433-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 53Reik W. Nature. 2007; 447: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms of targeting are poorly understood. Transcription factors that maintain chromatin with the appropriate epigenetic marks through recruitment of these factors are certain to play important biological functions, for example by maintaining a silent state or priming target genes for later expression in stem/progenitor and memory cells. Our data suggest that Oct1 regulates the expression of its targets, at least in part, through spatial control of chromatin-modifying factors.The absence of Oct1 is associated with abnormal DNA hypomethylation at a CG site proximal to the Il2 transcription start site in naïve T cells, but is also associated with abnormal hypermethylation at that site in previously stimulated, resting T cells. These changes in DNA methylation are likely an indirect readout of Oct1 regulation through NuRD and Jmjd1a. Surprisingly, both in fibroblasts following stress and in resting but previously stimulated T cells Jmjd1a was simultaneously present with H3K9me2 in wild-type cells. These results suggest that Jmjd1a is either not active in these situations (for example due to lack of cofactors) or that an opposing histone methyltransferase activity such as G9a (54Tachibana M. Matsumura Y. Fukuda M. Kimura H. Shinkai Y. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2681-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) continually deposits this mark as it is being removed. We favor the latter mechanism because in wild-type T cells, the mark is present but does not accumulate or become expanded such that DNA methylation takes place, but in the absence of Oct1 it does, suggesting a finely regulated balance of activities.The absence of Oct1 in resting T cells leads to poor activation upon restimulation relative to wild-type T cells. These findings have implications for the generation of T cell memory responses and, by extension, the ability to resist infection by certain pathogens. Oct1 is associated with the expression of multiple cytokines, including Il-3, Il-5, Il-8, Il-12/23 (55Pfeuffer I. Klein-Hessling S. Heinfling A. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Brabletz T. Hentsch B.

Cell. 2002; 10: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Here, we show using three different systems (fibroblasts, primary T cells, and a colon cancer cell line) that Oct1 is a bipotential and switchable transcriptional regulator. In fibroblasts, Oct1 mediates recruitment of the Jmjd1a histone demethylase to target genes (Polr2a and Ahcy) following oxidative stress exposure. In the absence of Oct1, Jmjd1a fails to be recruited, H3K9me2 levels are elevated, and inappropriate repression is observed. In contrast, Oct1 recruits the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD/Mi-2) chromatin remodeling complex to the Il2 promoter in naïve CD4 T cells to mediate gene repression. The recruitment is regulated because upon T cell activation Oct1 loses its capacity to associate with NuRD and instead is required for recruitment of Jmjd1a. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment is sufficient to switch association from NuRD to Jmjd1a, despite the fact that PMA is insufficient to activate Il2. In resting but previously stimulated T cells, Oct1 is required to maintain Jmjd1a at Il2, remove histone H3K9me2 marks and protect DNA from methylation, promoting the stronger expression associated with secondary stimulation. In DLD-1 colon adenocarcinoma cells, Oct1 bound to the Cdx2 target locus is required for mutually exclusive NuRD and Jmjd1a association. PMA treatment of DLD-1 cells results in reduced Jmjd1a association and represses Cdx2 in a manner requiring Oct1.

These results show that Oct1 is a bipotential factor capable of acting through opposing mechanisms to reinforce repressed or inducible states, even at the same target gene. DISCUSSIONHere, we show that Oct1 is a bipotential transcription factor capable of regulated switching between repressive and antirepressive modes. Our data are consistent with the model shown in Fig. 6. Oct1 mediates antirepression at two housekeeping targets (Polr2a and Ahcy) by enabling the recruitment of Jmjd1a and maintaining chromatin free of histone H3K9me2. At the regulated Il2 target locus promoter region, Oct1 mediates recruitment of the NuRD corepressor complex in naïve T cells and recruitment of Jmjd1a in previously activated, resting T cells. When naïve cells are stimulated, Oct1 becomes modified through mechanisms involving MAPK and ERK signaling such that it no longer recruits NuRD and instead, directly or indirectly recruits Jmjd1a. We detected a biochemical interaction between Oct1 and NuRD, but have thus far failed to detect Jmjd1a. Therefore we cannot eliminate the possibility that the association with Jmjd1a is indirect. MAPK signaling is attenuated after the T cell stimulus is removed; however, the antirepressive state is retained even after 8 days in culture without stimulation. Therefore, the modification(s) induced by MAPK signals are either stable, or some other activity (e.g. the induction of Oct1 cofactors) maintains the switched state over longer times. This state allows faster Il2 induction in rested T cells relative to naïve cells and may be constitutive at Polr2a and Ahcy, allowing gene expression to recover more rapidly in wild-type fibroblasts relative to Oct1-deficient fibroblasts following stress exposure.Oct1 also mediates recruitment of NuRD and Jmjd1a and is important for PMA-mediated gene regulation at the Cdx2 Oct1 target locus in DLD-1 cells. Also as with T cells, loss of Oct1 superficially appears to affect Cdx2 expression minimally; however, upon more careful examination Oct1 is critical for correct regulation. Several differences were also noted between the DLD-1 and T cell system. First, PMA mediates transcriptional silencing rather than transcriptional activation. Second, Oct1 is required for regulation by PMA. Third, both NuRD and Jmjd1a were detected in normally cultured cells as measured by ChIP. Sequential ChIP assays failed to detect any co-binding of the two activities, suggesting that DLD-1 cells are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of Oct1 associated with the different activities. Cumulatively, these findings suggest that Oct1 stabilizes both repressed and inducible transcriptional states. This bipotential form of transcription factor regulation has been associated with other transcription factor classes. For example, thyroid hormone receptor can switch from an activator to a repressor of the same targets in a ligand-regulated manner. This switch is mediated by exchange of coactivators and corepressors, including remodeling enzymes such as NuRD (35Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Côté J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 51Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).Chromatin-modifying complexes are central regulators of gene expression (22Jenuwein T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3121-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 52Denslow S.A. Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5433-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 53Reik W. Nature. 2007; 447: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms of targeting are poorly understood. Transcription factors that maintain chromatin with the appropriate epigenetic marks through recruitment of these factors are certain to play important biological functions, for example by maintaining a silent state or priming target genes for later expression in stem/progenitor and memory cells. Our data suggest that Oct1 regulates the expression of its targets, at least in part, through spatial control of chromatin-modifying factors.The absence of Oct1 is associated with abnormal DNA hypomethylation at a CG site proximal to the Il2 transcription start site in naïve T cells, but is also associated with abnormal hypermethylation at that site in previously stimulated, resting T cells. These changes in DNA methylation are likely an indirect readout of Oct1 regulation through NuRD and Jmjd1a. Surprisingly, both in fibroblasts following stress and in resting but previously stimulated T cells Jmjd1a was simultaneously present with H3K9me2 in wild-type cells. These results suggest that Jmjd1a is either not active in these situations (for example due to lack of cofactors) or that an opposing histone methyltransferase activity such as G9a (54Tachibana M. Matsumura Y. Fukuda M. Kimura H. Shinkai Y. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2681-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) continually deposits this mark as it is being removed. We favor the latter mechanism because in wild-type T cells, the mark is present but does not accumulate or become expanded such that DNA methylation takes place, but in the absence of Oct1 it does, suggesting a finely regulated balance of activities.The absence of Oct1 in resting T cells leads to poor activation upon restimulation relative to wild-type T cells. These findings have implications for the generation of T cell memory responses and, by extension, the ability to resist infection by certain pathogens. Oct1 is associated with the expression of multiple cytokines, including Il-3, Il-5, Il-8, Il-12/23 (55Pfeuffer I. Klein-Hessling S. Heinfling A. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Brabletz T. Hentsch B.

Nature. 2007; 447: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms of targeting are poorly understood. Transcription factors that maintain chromatin with the appropriate epigenetic marks through recruitment of these factors are certain to play important biological functions, for example by maintaining a silent state or priming target genes for later expression in stem/progenitor and memory cells. Our data suggest that Oct1 regulates the expression of its targets, at least in part, through spatial control of chromatin-modifying factors. The absence of Oct1 is associated with abnormal DNA hypomethylation at a CG site proximal to the Il2 transcription start site in naïve T cells, but is also associated with abnormal hypermethylation at that site in previously stimulated, resting T cells. These changes in DNA methylation are likely an indirect readout of Oct1 regulation through NuRD and Jmjd1a. Surprisingly, both in fibroblasts following stress and in resting but previously stimulated T cells Jmjd1a was simultaneously present with H3K9me2 in wild-type cells. These results suggest that Jmjd1a is either not active in these situations (for example due to lack of cofactors) or that an opposing histone methyltransferase activity such as G9a (54Tachibana M. Matsumura Y. Fukuda M. Kimura H. Shinkai Y. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2681-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) continually deposits this mark as it is being removed. We favor the latter mechanism because in wild-type T cells, the mark is present but does not accumulate or become expanded such that DNA methylation takes place, but in the absence of Oct1 it does, suggesting a finely regulated balance of activities. The absence of Oct1 in resting T cells leads to poor activation upon restimulation relative to wild-type T cells. These findings have implications for the generation of T cell memory responses and, by extension, the ability to resist infection by certain pathogens. Oct1 is associated with the expression of multiple cytokines, including Il-3, Il-5, Il-8, Il-12/23 (55Pfeuffer I. Klein-Hessling S. Heinfling A. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Brabletz T. Hentsch B.

Oct1 is also associated with other loci of immunological interest (e.g. 63Thévenin C. Lucas B.P. Kozlow E.J. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, a reexamination of the role of Oct1 at these targets may shed light on their regulation. For example, a negative activity has been associated with the octamer site in the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer in B/T cell hybrids (66Shen L. Lieberman S. Eckhardt L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3530-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It was postulated that a transcriptional repressor occupies this site in non-B cells. Our data suggest that the positive activity in B cells and the negative activity in non-B cells may be one and the same, and involve differential Oct1 cofactor recruitment. Rather than directly promoting expression of the aforementioned target genes, the principal role of Oct1 may be, in one mode, maintenance of repression, and in the opposite mode, prevention of transcriptional repression, i.e. poising for later expression.

https://openalex.org/W2071629571,"Background: The vast computational resources that became available during the past decade enabled the development and simulation of increasingly complex mathematical models of cancer growth. These models typically involve many free parameters whose determination is a substantial obstacle to model development. Direct measurement of biochemical parameters in vivo is often difficult and sometimes impracticable, while fitting them under data-poor conditions may result in biologically implausible values. Results: We discuss different methodological approaches to estimate parameters in complex biological models. We make use of the high computational power of the Blue Gene technology to perform an extensive study of the parameter space in a model of avascular tumor growth. We explicitly show that the landscape of the cost function used to optimize the model to the data has a very rugged surface in parameter space. This cost function has many local minima with unrealistic solutions, including the global minimum corresponding to the best fit. Conclusions: The case studied in this paper shows one example in which model parameters that optimally fit the data are not necessarily the best ones from a biological point of view. To avoid force-fitting a model to a dataset, we propose that the best model parameters should be found by choosing, among suboptimal parameters, those that match criteria other than the ones used to fit the model. We also conclude that the model, data and optimization approach form a new complex system, and point to the need of a theory that addresses this problem more generally."
https://openalex.org/W2016464464,"Efficient human motor control is characterized by an extensive use of joint impedance modulation, which is achieved by co-contracting antagonistic muscles in a way that is beneficial to the specific task. While there is much experimental evidence available that the nervous system employs such strategies, no generally-valid computational model of impedance control derived from first principles has been proposed so far. Here we develop a new impedance control model for antagonistic limb systems which is based on a minimization of uncertainties in the internal model predictions. In contrast to previously proposed models, our framework predicts a wide range of impedance control patterns, during stationary and adaptive tasks. This indicates that many well-known impedance control phenomena naturally emerge from the first principles of a stochastic optimization process that minimizes for internal model prediction uncertainties, along with energy and accuracy demands. The insights from this computational model could be used to interpret existing experimental impedance control data from the viewpoint of optimality or could even govern the design of future experiments based on principles of internal model uncertainty."

However, the mechanism by which E3 ubiquitin ligase is involved in collagen synthesis in liver fibrosis is incompletely understood. This study aimed to explore the involvement of the E3 ubiquitin ligase synoviolin (Syno) in liver fibrosis.The expression and localization of synoviolin in the liver were analyzed in CCl(4)-induced hepatic injury models and human cirrhosis tissues. The degree of liver fibrosis and the number of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was compared between wild type (wt) and Syno(+/-) mice in the chronic hepatic injury model. We compared the ratio of apoptosis in activated HSCs between wt and Syno(+/-) mice. We also analyzed the effect of synoviolin on collagen synthesis in the cell line from HSCs (LX-2) using siRNA-synoviolin and a mutant synoviolin in which E3 ligase activity was abolished. Furthermore, we compared collagen synthesis between wt and Syno(-/-) mice embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) using quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, and collagen assay; then, we immunohistochemically analyzed the localization of collagen in Syno(-/-) MEF cells.In the hepatic injury model as well as in cirrhosis, synoviolin was upregulated in the activated HSCs, while Syno(+/-) mice developed significantly less liver fibrosis than in wt mice. The number of activated HSCs was decreased in Syno(+/-) mice, and some of these cells showed apoptosis. Furthermore, collagen expression in LX-2 cells was upregulated by synoviolin overexpression, while synoviolin knockdown led to reduced collagen expression. Moreover, in Syno(-/-) MEF cells, the amounts of intracellular and secreted mature collagen were significantly decreased, and procollagen was abnormally accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum.Our findings demonstrate the importance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase synoviolin in liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2033725512,"Kicking Out Introns Many genes in eukaryotes contain introns that must be removed from the messenger RNA for proper gene function. Humans have on average eight introns per gene, whereas more than 90% of the genes in the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans have none at all. To understand how introns can be lost from genes, Mitrovich et al. (p. 838 ) compared non–protein-coding genes among the yeasts and found that genes for small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in C. albicans are intronic. By contrast in S. cerevisiae , snoRNAs are processed from unmodified RNA, suggesting a massive loss of snoRNAs—associated introns in the common ancestor of the Saccharomyces species. The introns seem to have been lost through splice-site degeneration, and associated compaction of linked exons resulted in nested splicing of some snoRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2038522404,"In most organisms, thioredoxin (Trx) and/or glutathione (GSH) systems are essential for redox homeostasis and deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. Platyhelminth parasites have a unique and simplified thiol-based redox system, in which the selenoprotein thioredoxin-glutathione reductase (TGR), a fusion of a glutaredoxin (Grx) domain to canonical thioredoxin reductase domains, is the sole enzyme supplying electrons to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and Trx. This enzyme has recently been validated as a key drug target for flatworm infections. In this study, we show that TGR possesses GSH-independent deglutathionylase activity on a glutathionylated peptide. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deglutathionylation and GSSG reduction are mediated by the Grx domain by a monothiolic mechanism and that the glutathionylated TGR intermediate is resolved by selenocysteine. Deglutathionylation and GSSG reduction via Grx domain, but not Trx reduction, are inhibited at high [GSSG]/[GSH] ratios. We found that Trxs (cytosolic and mitochondrial) provide alternative pathways for deglutathionylation and GSSG reduction. These pathways are operative at high [GSSG]/[GSH] and function in a complementary manner to the Grx domain-dependent one. Despite the existence of alternative pathways, the thioredoxin reductase domains of TGR are an obligate electron route for both the Grx domain- and the Trx-dependent pathways. Overall, our results provide an explanation for the unique array of thiol-dependent redox pathways present in parasitic platyhelminths. Finally, we found that TGR is inhibited by 1-hydroxy-2-oxo-3-(N-3-methyl-aminopropyl)-3-methyl-1-triazene (NOC-7), giving further evidence for NO donation as a mechanism of action for oxadiazole N-oxide TGR inhibitors. Thus, NO donors aimed at TGR could disrupt the entire redox homeostasis of parasitic flatworms."

In those cells, M1 muscarinic and AT1 angiotensin types do not elicit Ca2+i signals and suppress both currents via depletion of PIP2, whereas the B2 bradykinin and P2Y purinergic types elicit robust IP3-mediated [Ca2+]i rises and neither deplete PIP2 nor inhibit ICa. We have suggested that this specificity arises from differential Ca2+i signals underlying receptor-specific stimulation of PIP2 synthesis by phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase. Here, we investigate which PI 4-kinase isoform underlies this signal, whether stimulation of PI 4-phosphate 5-kinase is also required, and the origin of receptor-specific Ca2+i signals. Recordings of ICa were used as a PIP2 “biosensor.” In control, stimulation of M1, but not B2 or P2Y, receptors robustly suppressed ICa. However, when PI 4-kinase IIIβ, diacylglycerol kinase, Rho, or Rho-kinase was blocked, agonists of all three receptors robustly suppressed ICa. Overexpression of exogenous M1 receptors yielded large [Ca2+]i rises by muscarinic agonist, and transfection of wild-type IRBIT decreased Ca2+i signals, whereas dominant negative IRBIT-S68A had little effect on B2 or P2Y responses but greatly increased muscarinic responses.

Phosphoinositides comprise a diverse array of plasma membrane signaling molecules with temporal effects ranging from 1 ms to the lifetime of the organism. Most intensively studied are the polyphosphorylated phosphatidylinositols (PIs). 2The abbreviations used are: PIphosphatidylinositolPI(4)PPI 4-phosphatePIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateSCGsuperior cervical ganglionCaMcalmodulinPMplasma membraneEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinDNdominant negativeBKbradykininoxo-Moxotremorine methiodideKDkinase-deadDAGdiacylglycerolPAphosphatidic acidIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateIP3RIP3 receptor. The species phosphorylated at the 4′- and 5′-positions of the inositol ring by PI 4-kinase and PI 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) 5-kinase, called PI 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), have been implicated as a critical player in myriad cellular activities. These include cytoskeletal remodeling, vesicular/protein trafficking among intracellular membranes, transcriptional control, and regulation of ion channels and transporters. Regarding the latter role, a large and widening array of such membrane transport proteins have been shown to be regulated by plasma membrane PIP2, presumably due to direct binding (1Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 1-14Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2Suh B.C. Hille B. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The action is thought to arise from either PIP2 depletion by stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptors or from alterations in the affinity of PIP2 for the channels caused by generation of other signaling molecules (3Logothetis D.E. Lupyan D. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) as a model, we have focused on PIP2-mediated regulation of voltage-gated “M-type” (KCNQ) K+ and “N-type” Ca2+ currents. The former is so named for its depression by muscarinic stimulation, whose mechanism has been established as being due to depletion of PIP2 (4Hernandez C.C. Falkenburger B. Shapiro M.S. J. Gen.

However, stimulation of other PLC-linked receptors (bradykinin B2 and purinergic P2Y) in those neurons does not deplete PIP2 and displays a pattern of M-current depression via intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) signals (15Bofill-Cardona E.

What accounts for the pronounced receptor specificity in [Ca2+]i signals? One hypothesis involves subcellular clustering of certain plasma membrane PLC-linked receptors into microdomains together with endoplasmic reticulum membrane IP3 receptors. Thus, B2, but not M1, receptors have been shown to physically interact with IP3 receptors, and the two proteins have been shown to strongly co-localize under confocal microscopy (22Delmas P. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 36: 787-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, however, several regulators of IP3 receptors have been characterized that modify the efficacy of IP3 to open its receptor (24Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1426-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar); among those, IRBIT (IP3 receptor-binding protein released with IP3) (25Ando H. Mizutani A. Kiefer H. Tsuzurugi D.

In this work, we perform several tests of these mechanisms. The receptor specificity in Ca2+i signaling parallels the receptor specificity in which receptors deplete PIP2, whose origin is suggested to at least partly lie with Ca2+i-mediated stimulation of PIP2 synthesis, via NCS-1 (neuronal Ca2+ sensor-1) action on PI 4-kinase (9Winks J.S.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8914-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, dramatic hormonal stimulation of PIP2 synthesis concurrent with PLC activation is well known in the literature (e.g. stimulation of PLC-linked muscarinic receptors accelerates PIP2 synthesis many-fold in smooth muscle and platelets (27Sekar M.C. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Lassing I. Lindberg U. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and careful measurements coupled with cellular modeling indicate that strong stimulation of PIP2 synthesis in neuroblastoma cells and cerebellar spines in the brain is required to account for the mass of IP3 produced (29Willars G.B.

Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 1795-1812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). However, is acceleration of PI 4-kinase sufficient to maintain PIP2 levels in the face of PLC activation, or is concurrent acceleration of PI(4)P 5-kinase required as well? In addition, among four mammalian PI 4-kinase isoforms, only PI 4-kinase IIIβ has been shown to be stimulated by calcified NCS-1 (33Zhao X. Várnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Tóth Z.E. Oker-Blom C.

Thus, we here also test the involvement of phosphatidic acid and the Rho monomeric GTPase, two types of signaling molecules reported to stimulate PI(4)P 5-kinase activity, either downstream of receptors or in a receptor-independent fashion (36Chong L.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also test whether PI 4-kinase IIIβ is a critical player in stimulation of PIP2 synthesis by B2 and P2Y receptors in sympathetic neurons. Our work highlights the central role of intracellular Ca2+ signals in conferring receptor specificity toward ion channel targets. The plasmids for wild-type and dominant negative (S68A) IRBIT, GST-tagged IRBIT(1–104), and the anti-IRBIT antibody were kindly given to us by the laboratory of Humbert De Smedt (Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, University of Leuven, Belgium). The cDNAs for wild-type and D656A bovine PI 4-kinase IIIβ and PIK93 were kindly given to us by Tamas Balla (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Sympathetic neurons were isolated from the superior cervical ganglia of 7–14-day-old rats of both genders (Sprague-Dawley) and cultured for 2–4 days. Rats were given a lethal overdose of halothane and decapitated. Neurons were dissociated using methods of Bernheim et al. (38Bernheim L. Beech D.J. Hille B. Neuron. 1991; 6: 859-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), plated on 4 × 4-mm glass coverslips (coated with poly-l-lysine) and incubated at 37 °C (5% CO2). Fresh culture medium containing nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml) and pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) were added to the cells 3 h after plating. For exogenous expression of cDNA constructs, we used the PDS-1000/He biolistic particle delivery system (“gene gun,” Bio-Rad), as described previously (39Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 337: 27-38PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was assumed to be determined by the random distribution of fired gold particles and was up to 10% of cultured neurons. Cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice with 100 mm sodium phosphate (PB, pH 7.4), three times with PB + 150 mm NaCl (PBS), and blocked with 5% goat serum and 0.1% saponin in PBS (PBS + GS). The cells were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with primary affinity-purified rabbit anti-IRBIT (40Devogelaere B. Beullens M. Sammels E. Derua R. Waelkens E. van Lint J. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Bollen M. De Smedt H. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (diluted 1:500 in PBS + GS) and mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:5000) antibodies. In the blocking controls, the anti-IRBIT antibody was pre-adsorbed with a 10-fold molar excess of affinity-purified recombinant GST-tagged IRBIT(1–104) peptide used to raise the antibody. Cells were washed six times with PBS and then incubated with goat rhodamine red-conjugated anti-rabbit and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:500, Jackson Immunoresearch) in PBS + GS for 1 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, twice with PB, and three times with water. Air-dried slides were mounted on a drop of Vectashield (Vector Laboratory) and sealed with nail polish. Stained cells were viewed with a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope, using excitation/emission filters appropriate for rhodamine red and FITC, and images were taken with a Cascade 512F enhanced-CCD camera controlled by Metamorph software running on a PC. The purification of the GST-tagged IRBIT(1–104) peptide was performed by us as previously described by others (40Devogelaere B. Beullens M. Sammels E. Derua R. Waelkens E. van Lint J. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Bollen M. De Smedt H. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), except that we did not cleave the GST moiety from the peptide. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1B150F-4, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) using a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller P-97 (Sutter Instruments) and had resistances of 1–2 megaohms when filled with internal solution and measured in standard bath solution. Membrane current was measured with pipette and membrane capacitance cancellation, sampled at 200 μs, and filtered at 1 kHz by an EPC-9 amplifier and PULSE software (HEKA/Instrutech, Port Washington, NY). In all electrophysiological experiments, the perforated patch method of recording was used with amphotericin B (600 ng/ml) in the pipette (41Rae J. Cooper K. Gates P. Watsky M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Amphotericin was prepared as a stock solution as 60 mg/ml in DMSO. In these experiments, the access resistance was <10 megaohms 5–10 min after seal formation. Cells were placed in a 500-μl perfusion chamber through which solution flowed at 1–2 ml/min. Inflow to the chamber was by gravity from several reservoirs, selectable by activation of solenoid valves (Warner Scientific). Bath solution exchange was essentially complete by <30 s. Experiments were performed at room temperature. To evaluate the amplitude of ICa, cells were held at −80 mV, and 20-ms depolarizing steps to 5 mV were applied every 5 s. The amplitude of ICa was usually defined as the inward current sensitive to Cd2+ (100 μm). UTP, bradykinin (BK), oxotremorine methiodide (oxo-M), and Cd2+ were used at concentrations of 10 μm, 250 nm, 10 μm, and 100 μm, respectively. The external solution used to record Ca2+ currents contained 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 500 nm tetrodotoxin, pH 7.4, with NaOH. The perforated patch pipette solution for voltage clamp experiments contained 150 mm CsCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical tests were performed using a paired t test or an unpaired t test where appropriate. Fluorescent microscopy was performed with an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope with an oil immersion ×40/1.30 numerical aperture objective. A Polychrome IV monochromator (T.I.L.L. Photonics, Martinsreid, Germany) was used as the excitation light source, and a FURA2 71000 filter cube (Chroma) was used for fura-2 imaging. SCG neurons were bath-loaded with fura-2/AM (2 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of pluronic acid (0.01%). Cells were excited alternatively at 340 and 380 nm (50–200 ms every 2 s), the fluorescence emission was collected by an IMAGO 12-bit cooled CCD camera, and images were stored/analyzed with TILLvisION 4.0 software. These fura-2 signals were not calibrated due to inherent difficulties in calibrating esterified indicator dyes (54Zhou Z. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1993; 469: 245-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Because the EGFP used in our SCG transfection experiments is very poorly excited in the UV (at 340 or 380 nm), it negligibly contaminates the fura-2 emission signals. In control experiments, the combined contamination from EGFP emission and from autofluorescence of the cell was measured to alter the 340/380 fura-2 emission ratio by <0.5%. Reagents used were as follows: oxotremorine methiodide and UTP (Sigma); DMEM, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen); and amphotericin B, bradykinin, and Y27632 (Calbiochem). To assay the extent of PIP2 depletion upon receptor stimulation in living cells, a convenient paradigm is to use the activity of an ion channel known to be PIP2-sensitive as a read-out of PIP2 levels in the membrane. Thus, we turned to our measurements of the inhibition in SCG neurons of N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which have been shown to be very sensitive to PIP2 abundance. SCG neurons were studied under perforated patch whole-cell voltage clamp and were pretreated with the Go/i blocker, pertussis toxin, to isolate Gq/11-mediated actions (42Beech D.J. Bernheim L. Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our previous work reported suppression of ICa by muscarinic M1 receptors, but not bradykinin B2 or purinergic P2Y receptors, via depletion of PIP2 molecules in the membrane, which are necessary for Ca2+ channel activity (10Gamper N. Reznikov V. Yamada Y. Yang J. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10980-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11Wu L. Bauer C.S. Zhen X.G. Xie C. Yang J.

Thus, the Ca2+ channels act as a PIP2 biosensor, and depression of ICa reports depletion of PIP2. Our previous work has demonstrated receptor-specific stimulation of PI 4-kinases via Ca2+i signals and NCS-1 to be involved in compensatory PIP2 synthesis concurrent with PLC hydrolysis. Thus, acute treatment of cells by the broad-spectrum PI 3- and PI 4-kinase blocker, wortmannin, or transfection into the neurons of a dominant negative (DN) NCS-1 mutant that cannot bind Ca2+ bestowed upon P2Y and B2 receptors the ability to depress ICa in SCG neurons (10Gamper N. Reznikov V. Yamada Y. Yang J. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10980-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Zaika O. Tolstykh G.P. Jaffe D.B. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8914-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, precisely which molecule might NCS-1 be targeting? Mammalian cells express at least four distinct isoforms of PI 4-kinases with varying functions and pharmacological profiles (43Balla A. Balla T. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Although types IIα and IIβ are found at the PM, neither is wortmannin-sensitive (44Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 45Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), ruling out these isoforms in this process. PI 4-kinase IIIα has been localized to the PM of vertebrate cells, where it would be well placed to underlie rapid synthesis of PI(4)P, whereas type IIIβ has been localized primarily to the Golgi (35Balla A. Kim Y.J. Varnai P. Szentpetery Z. Knight Z. Shokat K.M. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 46Tóth B. Balla A. Ma H. Knight Z.A. Shokat K.M. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36369-36377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, the literature presents us with something of a conundrum because the type IIIβ isoform implicated in regulation by Ca2+/NCS-1 (33Zhao X. Várnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Tóth Z.E. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40183-40189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) would appear to not be in the correct subcellular location. To test whether IIIβ is actually the relevant isoform in this system, we used two approaches. The first exploited the development of a new isoform-specific PI 4-kinase blocker, PIK93, with high potency against the type IIIβ but little effect on the type IIIα isoforms (35Balla A. Kim Y.J. Varnai P. Szentpetery Z. Knight Z. Shokat K.M. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We compared the suppression of ICa in control neurons with those pretreated with PIK93. In Fig. 1A are plotted the amplitudes of inward ICa, elicited by brief depolarizations to 5 mV in a control neuron, with representative current traces during different times in the experiment shown in the insets. We tested the responses of ICa to bath application of supramaximal concentrations of UTP, BK, and oxo-M, agonists of Gq/11-coupled purinergic P2Y, bradykinin B2, and muscarinic M1 receptors, respectively. As seen in our previous work, neither UTP nor BK caused significant suppressions of ICa, although oxo-M induced a strong suppression of the current in the same cell. However, when PI 4-kinase IIIβ was blocked by pretreatment of a neuron with PIK93 (0.3 μm, 7-min pretreatment), all three agonists caused significant suppressions of ICa (Fig. 1B), suggesting that PI 4-kinase IIIβ activity is required to maintain PIP2 levels during stimulation of B2 or P2Y receptors. Our second approach involved transfection into the neurons of the PI 4-kinase IIIβ kinase-dead (KD) D656A mutant that acts as a DN (47Zhao X.H. Bondeva T. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We again used ICa amplitudes as a PIP2 biosensor and compared the responses to UTP, BK, and oxo-M in neurons transfected with WT PI 4-kinase IIIβ or the D656A mutant. In a SCG neuron transfected with the WT kinase, the responses to the three agonists were similar to those seen in control neurons, with only oxo-M, but not BK or UTP, inducing a robust depression of ICa (Fig. 1C). However, in the cell transfected with the KD mutant, both UTP and BK now induced a significant depression of ICa (Fig. 1D). These data are summarized in Fig. 1E. For control neurons, the suppressions of ICa by UTP, BK, and oxo-M were 3.3 ± 0.5, 5.5 ± 0.8, and 57 ± 3% (n = 12), respectively. For PIK93-treated neurons, UTP, BK, and oxo-M suppressed ICa by 23 ± 6% (p < 0.01), 37 ± 7% (p < 0.01), and 59 ± 6% (n = 7), respectively. For neurons transfected with WT PI 4-kinase IIIβ, the suppressions of ICa by UTP, BK, and oxo-M were 5.0 ± 1.0, 3.4 ± 1.3, and 60 ± 5% (n = 5), respectively. For neurons transfected with the KD D656A mutant, the suppressions of ICa were 31 ± 3 (p < 0.001), 38 ± 4 (p < 0.001), and 56 ± 5% (n = 7), respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that heightened PI 4-kinase IIIβ isoform activity is required to prevent PIP2 levels from falling upon stimulation of P2Y and B2 receptors in SCG neurons. We also quantified tonic ICa amplitudes in these two groups of cells to see what effect expression of WT or KD PI 4-kinase IIIβ might have on tonic PIP2 levels. Indeed, those values were 60 ± 5 and 37 ± 6 pA/picofarad (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 2G), indicating that not only is PI 4-kinase IIIβ necessary for receptor stimulation of PIP2 synthesis, but it is also needed for homeostatic maintenance of PIP2 abundance (although overexpression of the WT kinase did not augment tonic ICa amplitudes). Given our hypothesis of receptor stimulation of PI(4)P 5-kinase, we considered two putative signaling mechanisms found in the literature. A number of laboratories have shown PI(4)P 5-kinases to be regulated by Rho family GTPases, either directly or via its effector, Rho-kinase (48Chatah N.E. Abrams C.S. J. Biol.

Thus, we performed two tests of the involvement of these signaling molecules in PIP2 synthesis. To test the role of RhoA action in this process, we evaluated the effect of transfection into the neurons of the RhoA T19N mutant that acts as a DN (50Pochynyuk O. Medina J. Gamper N. Genth H.

Because specific enzymes for reductive iron release in Gram-positives are not known, we searched Firmicute genomes and found a novel association pattern of putative ferric siderophore reductases and uptake genes. The reductase from the schizokinen-producing alkaliphile Bacillus halodurans was found to cluster with a ferric citrate-hydroxamate uptake system and to catalyze iron release efficiently from Fe[III]-dicitrate, Fe[III]-schizokinen, Fe[III]-aerobactin, and ferrichrome. The gene was hence named fchR for ferric citrate and hydroxamate reductase. The tightly bound [2Fe-2S] cofactor of FchR was identified by UV-visible, EPR, CD spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Iron release kinetics were determined with several substrates by using ferredoxin as electron donor. Catalytic efficiencies were strongly enhanced in the presence of an iron-sulfur scaffold protein scavenging the released ferrous iron. Competitive inhibition of FchR was observed with Ga(III)-charged siderophores with Ki values in the micromolar range. The principal catalytic mechanism was found to couple increasing Km and KD values of substrate binding with increasing kcat values, resulting in high catalytic efficiencies over a wide redox range. Physiologically, a chromosomal fchR deletion led to strongly impaired growth during iron limitation even in the presence of ferric siderophores. Inductively coupled plasma-MS analysis of ΔfchR revealed intracellular iron accumulation, indicating that the ferric substrates were not efficiently metabolized. We further show that FchR can be efficiently inhibited by redox-inert siderophore mimics in vivo, suggesting that substrate-specific ferric siderophore reductases may present future targets for microbial pathogen control.

Siderophore-dependent iron acquisition is an essential metabolic feature employed by a vast number of bacteria, fungi, plants, and even higher eukaryotes (1Hider R.C. Kong X. Nat. Prod.

Key steps of typical siderophore pathways include siderophore synthesis, secretion, and uptake of siderophore-bound iron that is coupled to its intracellular or extracellular release. Within siderophore pathways, iron release processes are still widely uncharacterized. Generally, two enzymatic strategies are known for direct release of ferric siderophore complexes, which are hydrolysis of the siderophore backbone or reduction of the complexed ferric iron species, thus representing either a scaffold- or metal-targeted release mechanism (5Miethke M. Marahiel M.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 413-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 6Schröder I. Johnson E. de Vries S. FEMS Microbiol.

Biometals. 2009; 22: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which may not necessarily be mutually exclusive. Iron release outside the cytosol, including compartments such as the bacterial periplasm or eukaryotic vacuoles, may further be coupled to protonation of ferric siderophore complexes (8Froissard M.

Curr. Chem. 1984; 123: 49-102Crossref Google Scholar). Hydrolytic release of iron is restricted to a small number of siderophores possessing bonds that can be efficiently attacked by water. Usually, these are ester bonds that are present in trilactone siderophores like enterobactin, bacillibactin, salmochelins, or triacetylfusarinine C. For those siderophores, several esterases have been described that partially or completely hydrolyze these intramolecular ester bridges (10Lin H. Fischbach M.A. Liu D.R. Walsh C.T. J. Am. Chem.

Their ferric complexes are generally released by metal reduction and/or complex protonation. Reductive release in the extracellular environment has been described for the membrane-standing ferric reductases in yeast, especially Fre1p, Fre2p, Fre3p, and Fre4p (15Yun C.W. Bauler M. Moore R.E.

They are similar to b-type cytochromes and belong to the flavocytochrome superfamily using FAD, NAD(P)H, and heme cofactors for electron transfer during catalysis. Electron shuttling across the cytosolic membrane is suggested to be coupled with proton transfer resulting in extracellular acidification (16Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which may increase the redox potentials of the ferric complexes. Generally, the iron-chelate redox potentials greatly differ among the different classes of siderophores. Triscatecholates such as ferric enterobactin (Fe(III)-enterobactin) with iron binding affinities in the range of 1049 m−1 possess standard redox potentials of their ferric complexes at E′0, pH 7.0, of −750 mV or lower (17Loomis L.D. Raymond K.N. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 906-911Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 18Pierre J.L. Fontecave M. Crichton R.R. Biometals. 2002; 15: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Redox potentials of hydroxamates such as ferrichrome or ferrioxamines, and citrate-hydroxamates such as ferric aerobactin (Fe(III)-aerobactin) are higher but still in the negative range below an E′0, pH 7.0, of about −300 mV, whereas carboxylates such as ferric dicitrate (Fe(III)-dicitrate) are ranging above them at E′0, pH 7.0, of about 0 mV (6Schröder I. Johnson E. de Vries S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 427-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). According to the physiological range of cellular redox compounds, many ferric siderophores can be potentially reduced by soluble redox cofactors, a mechanism that has mainly been described for cytosolic iron release in bacteria (6Schröder I.

In these cases, usually flavin reductases catalyze electron transfer from NAD(P)H toward different flavins such as FMN, FAD, or riboflavin. These flavins may then be released from the enzyme as free reducing agents such as in Escherichia coli NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase Fre and its homologs in Vibrio (19Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S.

In addition, extracellular FSRs 2The abbreviations used are: FSRferric siderophore reductaseFdferredoxinPhen1,10-phenanthrolineBP2,2′-bipyridylNHEnormal hydrogen electrodeICP-MSinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. dependent on NADH and flavins were described in several species, including E. coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes (24Cowart R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 400: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Generally, these FSRs act on a broad set of substrates, including iron-loaded non-siderophores such as cytochrome c or ferredoxin and non-metals such as sulfite or nitro compounds, and hence are not specifically linked with iron assimilatory metabolism and regulation. Still, there are few examples of cytosolic FSRs showing a direct relation with iron metabolism as well as direct interaction with a defined set of ferric chelate substrates. One reductase that is suggested to fulfill these criteria is E. coli FhuF, which was shown to reduce several ferric hydroxamate complexes (25Müller K. Matzanke B.F. Schünemann V. Trautwein A.X.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). FhuF contains a C-terminal iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster that likely permits electron transfer from the enzyme to its cognate substrates. Although FhuF-type reductases are present in several enterobacterial species, further types of putative reductases with C-terminally conserved cysteine motif are distributed in other phyla including Firmicutes. Their reductases have not been characterized yet, and it has not been described that Gram-positive bacteria possess iron-regulated or substrate-defined FSRs. ferric siderophore reductase ferredoxin 1,10-phenanthroline 2,2′-bipyridyl normal hydrogen electrode inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Here, we describe for the first time a distinct FSR from a Gram-positive bacterium. The reductase was found to be iron-regulated and to possess a stably bound low-potential Fe/S cofactor. Its kinetic analysis revealed a redox-scaled substrate spectrum defined by both cluster midpoint potential and substrate affinity. Genetic analyses showed that its function is decisive for cellular iron metabolism and that it can be inhibited by redox-inert siderophores during iron deprivation. We thus present novel mechanistics insights into cytosolic iron release, which might have implications for antibiotic strategies. Bacillus halodurans DSM497 (DSMZ stock, Braunschweig, Germany) was routinely cultured in LB medium containing 0.1 mm sodium sesquicarbonate (4.2 g of NaHCO3, 5.3 g of Na2CO3 per liter) at pH 9.7 (“LB-ha broth”) at 37 °C. DNA was prepared from late log phase cultures by the following procedure. After washing cells twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm Na-EDTA), 0.1 mm lysozyme was added, and the solution was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Upon addition of 2% (w/v) SDS and 1 m sodium perchlorate, cell proteins were precipitated, and after extraction with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol at 24:1 (v/v), DNA was separated into the aqueous phase. DNA was precipitated by addition of 2 volumes of ethanol, washed in 70% (v/v) ethanol, dried under vacuum, and dissolved in TE buffer. RNA was removed by RNase I treatment (0.1 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. For amplification of genes BH1040 and BH1037, primer pairs ATATCTAGATAACGAGGGCAAAAAATGATCGAGCCACCTGTTATGAATG (BH1040_forward)/GCTCGGTTTGCGAGGGCACGTCC (BH1040_reverse), and ATAGGATCCGGAGGAAATGAACCAAGCGAAG (BH1037_forward)/ATAAAGCTTCTATTGTGTAAGGGAATCAACGAG (BH1037_reverse) were used, respectively, according to the data base genome sequence of B. halodurans C-125 (restriction sites are underlined, primer BH1040_reverse blunt end and phosphorylated). BH1040 and BH1037 were cloned into pMM30 and pCB28a+ (12Miethke M. Klotz O. Linne U. May J.J. Beckering C.L. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1413-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) resulting in pMM30-1 and pMM20 expression vectors providing a C-terminal Strep-tag II and an N-terminal His6-tag, respectively. In vitro DNA manipulations and E. coli transformations were done according to described methods (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 cells transformed with the desired expression vector were grown in LB medium at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.5 and then induced with 0.2 mg/liter anhydrotetracycline (pMM30-1) or 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (pMM20) for 3 h at 30 °C. For purification of recombinant B. halodurans BH1040, cells were harvested, resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and disrupted by using a French press (Thermo Scientific), and the filtrated lysate was subjected to Strep-Tactin chromatography using an FPLC purifier system (GE Healthcare) and a column with 2 ml of Strep-Tactin superflow material (IBA). The recombinant protein was eluted with 2.5 mm d-desthiobiotin (IBA). Purification of recombinant B. halodurans BH1037 and recombinant Bacillus subtilis SufU was done by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described previously (12Miethke M. Klotz O. Linne U.

Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The pooled and concentrated elution fractions were then applied to size exclusion chromatography using a 26/60 Superdex 200 column and 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions of the dominant single UV peak were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing pure protein were concentrated using centrifugal filter devices with a 10,000 cutoff. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using a BSA calibration curve. Protein was shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. For measurement of oxidized protein spectra, purified protein was diluted to the desired concentration in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the solution was placed into a quartz cuvette (n = 1 cm). For measurement of reduced protein spectra, the protein was treated with 5 mm sodium dithionite under anaerobic conditions (95% N2, 5% H2). Reduced protein was placed into an anaerobic cuvette, which was tightly sealed before measurements were performed. Spectra were recorded at an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer usually from 250 to 800 nm. Data were analyzed with SWIFT Scan 2.06. A Zorbax GF-250 column was equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using an Agilent HPLC system (1200 series). The column was calibrated using a mixture of ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), conalbumin (75 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa) at 0.5 ml/min at 25 °C. 100 μg of purified recombinant FchR was then applied at the same flow rate and temperature. UV spectra at 280 nm were recorded and analyzed with Agilent ChemStation software B.03. B. halodurans wild-type (WT) and B. halodurans ΔfchR were cultivated in LB-ha broth supplemented with 100 μm FeCl3 or different concentrations (5–50 μm) of 2,2′-bipyridyl (BP) and 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen). Cells were harvested at late log phase, washed twice with TE buffer, and disrupted after addition of 1 mm serine protease inhibitor PMSF by sonication (four times for 1 min at 50 watts). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C), and clear lysate was separated. Protein concentrations of cytosolic extracts were determined by the Bradford method, and 20 μg were applied to each lane for SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide). Furthermore, debris fractions containing major portions of cell membranes were resolubilized in 8 m urea, 0.5 m DTT by boiling at 95 °C for 20 min. Resolubilized membrane fractions were also subjected to SDS-PAGE. As a control, 0.1 μg of purified recombinant FchR was additionally loaded on the gels, which were developed for 1.2 h at 150 mV, and then proteins were blotted onto a hyperbond PVDF membrane for 1 h at 200 mV. After blocking with 2.5% (w/v) BSA in TBS, polyclonal FchR-specific antibody (Pineda, Berlin, Germany) was applied for 12 h, and after washing secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled with alkaline phosphatase; Bio-Rad) was applied for 2 h. Blots were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium at pH 9.5 for signal detection. For iron determination, three samples (5, 10, and 20 μl) of 80 μm purified FchR, two buffer controls, and five samples (1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 nmol) of iron standard (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6 H2O were diluted to 100 μl with H2O. Subsequently, 100 μl of 1% (w/v) hydrochloric acid were added, and samples were mixed gently. Samples were incubated at 80 °C for 10 min, and 500 μl of 7.5% (w/v) ammonium acetate, 100 μl of 4% (w/v) ascorbic acid, 100 μl of 2.5% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μl of iron chelator (Ferene) were added sequentially. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g, and absorbance was measured at 590 nm against water. For determination of acid-labile sulfide, three samples (10, 20, and 40 μl) of 120 μm purified FchR, two buffer controls, and six samples (2, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 nmol) of Li2S sulfide standard were diluted to 200 μl with H2O. Then 600 μl of 1% (w/v) zinc acetate and 50 μl of 7% (w/v) NaOH were added, and samples were mixed shortly and incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. After short centrifugation, 150 μl of N,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, 0.1% (w/v) in 5 m HCl, and 150 μl of 10 mm FeCl3 in 1 m HCl were added quickly to start methylene blue formation. After short vortexing, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g, and absorbance was measured at 670 nm against water. Purified FchR was reduced anaerobically by incubation with 5 mm dithionite for 5 min to achieve quantitative cluster reduction. 50 μm of reduced protein were then measured at 40 K and 9.4681 GHz using a Bruker EPR spectrometer. The cluster concentration was quantified by comparing the numerically double-integrated 40 K spectra with those of a 1 mm Cu(II)-EDTA standard without saturation effects. 20 μm holo-FchR in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl were anaerobically incubated and mixed with redox mediators methyl viologen, benzyl viologen, neutral red, safranine T, phenosafranine, and anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (40 μm each). Actual redox potentials were determined continuously by using a platinum electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode under constant mixing of the protein/indicator solution as described previously (29Netz D.J. Stümpfig M. Doré C. Mühlenhoff U. Pierik A.J. Lill R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of dithionite were added stepwise, and 13 samples were taken between −215 mV/NHE (corresponding to the start potential) and −520 mV/NHE (corresponding to complete reduction). Immediately, frozen samples were measured at 77 K, and both amplitudes and slopes of the gy = 1.956 feature were plotted after corrections for sample volumes and concentrations and analyzed by fitting to the Nernst equation. Culture supernatant extracts were analyzed by using a C-18 column (Macherey-Nagel) with a water, 0.05% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile, 0.045% formic acid (B) gradient from 5 to 95% B in 30 min with a column temperature of 45 °C. Electrospray ionization-mass spectra of the eluting compounds were recorded in positive ion mode within the mass range of 100–1000 m/z. For a complete desalting of proteins by HPLC using an Agilent 1100 system, samples were applied to a monolithic 50:1 ProSwift RP-4H column (Dionex). Desalted proteins were eluted by the following gradient of A and B at a column temperature of 40 °C and a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min: isocratic elution with 5% A for 2 min, followed by a linear gradient to 95% B within 8 min, and holding 95% B for additional 4 min. Online mass spectrometric analysis was done with a QStar Pulsar i mass spectrometer (ABSciex, Darmstadt, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Parameters were as follows: DP1 75, FP 265, DP2 15, CAD 2, GS1 65, and CUR 35. The voltage applied was 5500 V. Positive ions within the mass range of 500–2000 m/z were detected. For better performance, the “Enhance All” mode was activated. CD measurements were carried out at a temperature of 20 °C using a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) and 0.5-cm path length cuvettes. Spectra were recorded with a measuring range from 650 to 265 nm, a bandwidth of 1 nm, a data pitch of 0.2 nm, a response of 1 s, and with standard sensitivity. The scanning speed was 100 nm min−1, and the presented data are an accumulation of 10 scans. The protein concentration of holo-FchR was 20 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 (the presented curves are corrected for the signal of the buffer). First, a spectrum of reduced holo-FchR was recorded, and then Ga(III)-dicitrate was added to a final concentration of 200 μm, and the next measurement was taken, followed by addition of Fe(III)-dicitrate to yield a final concentration of 100 μm and conductance of the next measurement. Incubation times between each addition and measurement were 15 min. The addition of the compounds was performed under anaerobic conditions. Purified recombinant protein solution in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was adjusted to the desired concentration, and 2 ml were applied into a 1 × 1-cm2 quartz cuvette. The cuvette was placed into an FP-6500 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco) and thermostated at 22 °C. Concentrated ferric siderophore stock solutions were freshly prepared and added stepwise to the protein solution. Tyrosine/tryptophan fluorescence was measured after excitation at 280 nm (slit width 5 nm) at 340 nm (slit width 5 nm). Each measurement was averaged three times. Data analysis and KD calculation were done as described previously (30Miethke M. Skerra A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All kinetic studies were performed under anaerobic atmosphere (5% H2 in N2) at 25 °C. For initial determination of enzyme substrate spectrum, 50 μm FchR was reduced with 5 mm dithionite for 5 min, then purified anaerobically via size exclusion chromatography using an Econo-Pac 10DG column (Bio-Rad), and incubated with 150 μm ferric siderophore substrates (Fe(III)-dicitrate and ferrioxamine E (Sigma); Fe(III)-aerobactin, Fe(III)-schizokinen, ferrichrome (EMC microcollections, Tübingen, Germany), Fe(III)-enterobactin (31Fischbach M.A. Lin H. Liu D.R. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) for 10 min in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl with varying pH values at 7.0, 7.5, 7.8, 8.0, 8.3, 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5 (although pH 9.5 is at the limit of the optimal buffer range, the same buffer was used to ensure comparable experimental conditions). Fe/S cluster spectra were measured before and after incubation to monitor cluster reoxidation. To test efficiency of FchR reduction by a physiological electron donor, measurements were repeated by using 2 mm NADH, NADPH, FADH2 (all obtained from Sigma) and ferredoxin (Fd; source, Spinacia oleracea; Sigma), which was reduced with dithionite and purified anaerobically. Detailed kinetics were then performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl at 25 °C by using 1 μm holo-FchR and 10 μm Fd together with a regenerative system consisting of NADPH:Fd oxidoreductase (source, S. oleracea; Sigma), which bears a low potential flavin with E½ = −442 mV, pH 8.0 (32Batie C.J. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7756-7763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and reversibly transfers electrons to Fd, possessing a low potential Fe2S2 cluster with E½ = −420 mV (33Tagawa K. Arnon D.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 153: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), through formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex (32Batie C.J. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7756-7763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (source, S. cerevisiae; Sigma) was used to ensure low steady-state concentrations of NADP+ potentially acting as a competitive inhibitor of NADPH:Fd oxidoreductase (34Dykes J. Davis D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 218: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Nonlimiting rate determination was done with starting concentrations of 2 mm glucose 6-phosphate and 2 mm NADPH, 0.5 units of regenerative enzymes, and varying concentrations of potassium ferricyanide (E′0, pH 7.0, = 436 mV). Conditions found to be sufficient for nonlimiting electron transfer were then applied to FchR-dependent kinetics with ferric siderophores over a substrate concentration range from 1 to 1000 μm. After 10 min, preincubation of regenerative enzymes with their substrates (glucose 6-phosphate, NADPH, Fd) and FchR, ferric siderophores were added, and starting velocities of iron release were measured by 3 min of incubation (initially determined to be within the time-dependent linear catalytic range). Fe(II) release was detected by addition of 0.15% (w/v) ferene and immediate measurement of absorbance at 590 nm using an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare) or, alternatively, a NanoDrop ND-1000 (peQLab). Fe(II) concentrations were calculated by using a Fe(II)-ferene calibration curve measured at the same wavelength. Further kinetics for Fe(III)-dicitrate, Fe(III)-aerobactin, and ferrichrome were performed in presence of 100 μm apo-SufU (source, B. subtilis (35Albrecht A.G. Netz D.J. Miethke M. Pierik A.J. Burghaus O. Peuckert F. Lill R. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)), which was de-metallized before by three dialysis steps in 100 mm EDTA-containing reaction buffer and frequent thermal shifts to 45 °C. Background reduction of ferric siderophore substrates (at maximum 4% relative to FchR-dependent reduction) was determined for each kinetic in absence of FchR and subtracted from iron release in the presence of FchR. Each kinetic was performed three times independently, and averaged data were plotted with obtained standard deviations. Kinetic parameters were determined upon Michaelis-Menten analysis by using Microcal Origin 5.0 software. Inhibition assays were performed by using Fe(III)-dicitrate as a substrate and Ga(III)-dicitrate and Ga(III)-desferrioxamine E as potential inhibitors. To determine the Ki values, Fe(III)-dicitrate concentrations were set around the Km value and additionally at saturating concentrations. Concentrations of the inhibitors were varied from 0 to 70 μm in case of Ga(III)-dicitrate and 0 to 12.5 μm in case of Ga(III)-desferrioxamine E. Assays were performed according to the established standard kinetic conditions. The inhibition constants were calculated by using the Dixon plot method (36Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus"
https://openalex.org/W2098664496,"The sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (SRY) has 2 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that flank the DNA binding high mobility group (HMG) domain; the β-NLS and the CaM-NLS, which mediate nuclear transport through importin β1 (Impβ1) and the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM), respectively. Here we reconstitute the nuclear import mediated by the 2 NLSs for the first time in vitro, establishing Ran independence of CaM-NLS-dependent transport. The β- and CaM-NLSs were found to be independently functional out of the context of the SRY HMG domain, dependent on Impβ1 and CaM binding, respectively. Intriguingly, direct protein binding assays also indicated competitive binding of Impβ1 and CaM to the SRY HMG domain. To assess the potential role of intracellular calcium in modulating SRY nuclear accumulation, Cos-7 cells expressing SRY and control constructs were treated with agents elevating or reducing intracellular Ca(2+) levels. The in vivo results, supported by experiments in vitro where transport was assessed with or without 2 μM Ca(2+), indicate a Ca(2+)-dependent mode of nuclear transport via the CaM-NLS/CaM, with inhibition of β-NLS/Impβ1-mediated nuclear import by intracellular Ca(2+). The results imply mutual exclusivity of nuclear transport via the 2 NLSs with intracellular Ca(2+) as the switch between the 2."
https://openalex.org/W2157659200,"Background Previous literature suggests that those with reading disability (RD) have more pronounced deficits during semantic processing in reading as compared to listening comprehension. This discrepancy has been supported by recent neuroimaging studies showing abnormal activity in RD during semantic processing in the visual but not in the auditory modality. Whether effective connectivity between brain regions in RD could also show this pattern of discrepancy has not been investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings Children (8- to 14-year-olds) were given a semantic task in the visual and auditory modality that required an association judgment as to whether two sequentially presented words were associated. Effective connectivity was investigated using Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) was used separately for each modality to find a winning family of DCM models separately for typically developing (TD) and RD children. BMS yielded the same winning family with modulatory effects on bottom-up connections from the input regions to middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and inferior frontal gyrus(IFG) with inconclusive evidence regarding top-down modulations. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was thus conducted across models in this winning family and compared across groups. The bottom-up effect from the fusiform gyrus (FG) to MTG rather than the top-down effect from IFG to MTG was stronger in TD compared to RD for the visual modality. The stronger bottom-up influence in TD was only evident for related word pairs but not for unrelated pairs. No group differences were noted in the auditory modality. Conclusions/Significance This study revealed a modality-specific deficit for children with RD in bottom-up effective connectivity from orthographic to semantic processing regions. There were no group differences in connectivity from frontal regions, suggesting that the core deficit in RD is not in top-down modulation."

https://openalex.org/W2007843607,"Computational prediction of functionally related groups of genes (functional modules) from large-scale data is an important issue in computational biology. Gene expression experiments and interaction networks are well studied large-scale data sources, available for many not yet exhaustively annotated organisms. It has been well established, when analyzing these two data sources jointly, modules are often reflected by highly interconnected (dense) regions in the interaction networks whose participating genes are co-expressed. However, the tractability of the problem had remained unclear and methods by which to exhaustively search for such constellations had not been presented.We provide an algorithmic framework, referred to as Densely Connected Biclustering (DECOB), by which the aforementioned search problem becomes tractable. To benchmark the predictive power inherent to the approach, we computed all co-expressed, dense regions in physical protein and genetic interaction networks from human and yeast. An automatized filtering procedure reduces our output which results in smaller collections of modules, comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results performed favorably in a fair benchmarking competition which adheres to standard criteria. We demonstrate the usefulness of an exhaustive module search, by using the unreduced output to more quickly perform GO term related function prediction tasks. We point out the advantages of our exhaustive output by predicting functional relationships using two examples.We demonstrate that the computation of all densely connected and co-expressed regions in interaction networks is an approach to module discovery of considerable value. Beyond confirming the well settled hypothesis that such co-expressed, densely connected interaction network regions reflect functional modules, we open up novel computational ways to comprehensively analyze the modular organization of an organism based on prevalent and largely available large-scale datasets.Software and data sets are available at http://www.sfu.ca/~ester/software/DECOB.zip."

https://openalex.org/W1970869742,"We examined whether protein kinase D1 (PKD1), the founding member of a new protein kinase family, plays a critical role in intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. Our results demonstrate that PKD1 activation is sustained, whereas that of PKD2 is transient in intestinal epithelial IEC-18 stimulated with the Gq-coupled receptor agonists angiotensin II or vasopressin. PKD1 gene silencing utilizing small interfering RNAs dramatically reduced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in IEC-18 cells stimulated with Gq-coupled receptor agonists. To clarify the role of PKD1 in intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in vivo, we generated transgenic mice that express elevated PKD1 protein in the intestinal epithelium. Transgenic PKD1 exhibited constitutive catalytic activity and phosphorylation at the activation loop residues Ser744 and Ser748 and on the autophosphorylation site, Ser916. To examine whether PKD1 expression stimulates intestinal cell proliferation, we determined the rate of crypt cell DNA synthesis by detection of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporated into the nuclei of crypt cells of the ileum. Our results demonstrate a significant increase (p < 0.005) in DNA-synthesizing cells in the crypts of two independent lines of PKD1 transgenic mice as compared with non-transgenic littermates. Morphometric analysis showed a significant increase in the length and in the total number of cells per crypt in the transgenic PKD1 mice as compared with the non-transgenic littermates (p < 0.01). Thus, transgenic PKD1 signaling increases the number of cells per crypt by stimulating the rate of crypt cell proliferation.

Collectively, our results indicate that PKD1 plays a role in promoting cell proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. The mammalian intestine is covered by a single layer of epithelial cells that is renewed every 4–5 days along the crypt-villus axis (1van der Flier L.G. Clevers H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). The high rate of cell turnover, driven by crypt cell proliferation, plays a fundamental role in the organization, maintenance, and restoration of tissue integrity. It is recognized that the sequential proliferation, lineage-specific differentiation, crypt-villus migration, and cell death of the epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa is a tightly regulated process modulated by a broad range of regulatory peptides, differentiation signals, and luminal stimuli, including nutrients and pathogenic/commensal organisms (1van der Flier L.G.

Despite its importance for understanding normal homeostasis, wound healing, and the pathogenesis of human disease states, including inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer, the intracellular signal transduction mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood.

PKD1 has been extensively studied in vitro with regard to identifying the functions of its domains and the effect of cell signaling on its activity and subcellular localization (4Rozengurt E. Rey O.

In unstimulated cells, PKD1 is in a state of low catalytic (kinase) activity maintained by autoinhibition mediated by the N-terminal domain, a region containing a repeat of cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motifs and a pleckstrin homology domain (4Rozengurt E.

In contrast, neither the regulation nor the function of PKD1 in mediating proliferative responses in normal intestinal epithelial cells has been examined. Moreover, the role of PKD1 signaling in the replication of crypt intestinal epithelial cells in vivo has not been addressed. Indeed, very little is known about the biological role of PKD1 in normal epithelial cells of intact animals. protein kinase D1 isoform protein kinase D2 isoform angiotensin II G protein-coupled receptor 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate transgenic non-transgenic GF109203X.

These cells, derived from cryptal cells of the small intestine, were used as model systems to examine the regulation of PKD1 activity and its role in DNA synthesis and proliferation of these intestinal epithelial cells (13Chiu T.

To evaluate the role of PKD1 in intact animals, we used transgenic expression of PKD1 in the mouse intestinal epithelium to determine the effect of its overexpression on cell proliferation and crypt architecture. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PKD1 promotes DNA synthesis and proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo.

For experimental purposes, IEC-18 or IEC-6 cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/dish the day before transfection. Our previous studies established that these cells express Gq-coupled receptors for angiotensin II (ANGII) and vasopressin (13Chiu T. Wu S.S. Santiskulvong C. Tangkijvanich P. Yee Jr., H.F.

Confluent IEC-18 cells were lysed in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and boiled for 10 min. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The transfer was carried out at 100 V, 0.4 A at 4 °C for 4 h using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus. The transfer buffer consisted of 200 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, 0.01% SDS, and 20% CH3OH. For detection of proteins, membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.2, and then incubated for at least 2 h with the desired antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3% nonfat dried milk. Primary antibodies bound to immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat antibodies. The phosphospecific antibodies used were as follows; the phospho PKD polyclonal antibodies Ser(P)916, Ser(P)744, and Ser(P)748 detect PKD only when it is phosphorylated on Ser916, Ser744, or Ser748;, and the phospho-MARCKS polyclonal antibody is specific to MARCKS only when it is phosphorylated on Ser152 and Ser156. Autoluminograms were scanned using a GS-710 scanner (Bio-Rad), and the labeled bands were quantified using the Quantity One software program (Bio-Rad). Confluent IEC-18 cells were washed twice with DMEM and equilibrated in 5 ml of the same medium at 37 °C for 1–2 h. Some dishes were treated with various pharmacological agents during this equilibration period or with agonists for different times at the end of this period, as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Cells were lysed in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, hydrochloride (Pefabloc), and 1% Triton X-100. PKD was immunoprecipitated with the PKD (PKD C-20) antiserum (1 μg/ml) raised against the C-terminal region of PKD1 (Santa Cruz). The immune complexes were recovered using protein-A coupled to agarose. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, then twice with kinase buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were initiated by combining 20 μl of immune complexes with 10 μl of a phosphorylation mixture containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP and syntide-2 at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in kinase buffer (final reaction volume, 30 μl) and transferred to a water bath at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 100 μl of 75 mm H3PO4, and 75 μl of the mixed supernatant was spotted to Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Papers were washed thoroughly in 75 μm H3PO4 and dried, and radioactivity incorporated into peptides was determined by detection of Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter. Confluent cultures of IEC-18 cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with DMEM/Waymouth's medium (1:1, v/v) containing various agonists as described in the figure legends. After 18 h of incubation at 37 °C, [3H]thymidine (0.2 μCi/ml, 1 μm) was added to the cultures for 6 h, the cultures were then washed twice with PBS and incubated in 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 20 min to remove acid-soluble radioactivity, washed with ethanol, and solubilized in 1 ml of 2% Na2CO3, 0.1 m NaOH. The acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting in 6 ml of Beckman Readysafe. The pooled siRNA duplexes were purchased from either Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) or Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). PKD1 siRNA pools were designed to target the mRNA of mouse PKD1 (GenBankTM accession number NM_008858) and consists of four different duplexes from Dharmacon (oligo1, GAAGAGAUGUAGCUAUUAAUU; oligo2, GAAAGAGUGUUUGUUGUUAUU; oligo3, CAUAAGAGAUGUGCAUUUAUU; oligo4, CAGCGAAUGUAGUGUAUUAUU) or three different duplexes from Santa Cruz (oligo1, CUCUCUUCGUUCAUUCAUAt; oligo2, GUGAGCAUUUCCGUUUCAAtt; oligo3, GAAGCCAUUGAUCUUAUCAtt). PKD2 siRNA consisted of a pool of three duplexes (Santa Cruz): oligo1, CCAUUGAGUUGGACAAGAUtt; oligo2, CACCUGCACUUCAAGAACAtt; oligo3, CCAGAAAUGAACUCUUGUAtt. For siRNA transfection the reverse transfection method was used; the siRNA pool was mixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and added to 35-mm dishes. IEC-18 cells were then plated on top of the siRNA/Lipofectamine RNAiMAX complex at a density of 1 × 105 cells/35-mm dish. Control transfections were carried out with Dharmacon siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA four-oligo pool (Sc) (catalogue number D-001206-13). Four days after transfection, cells were used for experiments and subsequent Western blot analysis. To generate transgenic mice that express elevated PKD protein in the intestinal epithelium, we used the rat fatty acid-binding protein promoter (−596 to +21; kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Gordon, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), which has been well characterized to target transgene expression to proliferating and non-proliferating epithelial cells of these regions of the intestine of FVB/N mice (45Simon T.C. Cho A. Tso P. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10652-10663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The fatty acid-binding protein promoter was fused to the cDNA for mouse PKD1 (+40 to +2910) and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal sequence using conventional cloning methods. A schematic diagram of the transgene construct (confirmed by sequencing) is shown in Fig. 4A. The transgene was excised by digestion with EcoRI and XhoI, gel-purified, and microinjected into FVB/N mouse oocytes. The integrated transgene was detected by PCR using genomic tail DNA and specific oligonucleotide primers F12 (sense, 5′- TATAACCGCTCTCTGGAC), corresponding to the PKD1 portion of the transgene, and bovine growth hormone receptor (antisense, 5′-ACTCAGACAATGCG), corresponding to the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence. We identified transgenic founder mice by PCR using genomic tail DNA and specific primers to detect the integrated transgene sequence as a product of 600bp (Fig. 4B). Founder mice were mated with wild type FVB/N mice, and two PKD1 transgenic lines (409 and 417) were established, propagated, and used in subsequent experiments. All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities, maintained on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle, and fed a standard autoclaved-stable rodent diet. The number of proliferating cells was detected by immunoperoxidase staining for the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Gender and age-matched mice (PKD1 transgenic and non-transgenic littermates) were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU (100 μg/g of body weight). After 3 h, the mice were anesthetized with halothane and cardioperfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and the ileum was removed and processed as described above. Sections (4 μm) of paraffin-embedded ileal tissue were deparaffinized and stained for BrdU incorporation using BrdU staining kit (BrdU In-situ Detection Kit II #551321, BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The proportion of BrdU-positive cells was determined at high magnification under light microscopy. Crypt cell proliferation was expressed as the percentage of BrdU-labeled cells per 100 crypt cells, and at least 20 full-length, well oriented ileal crypts per mouse were counted. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained histological sections were analyzed to determine the effect of transgenic PKD1 expression on tissue architecture. Briefly, 20 full-length, longitudinally cut crypts from each animal were analyzed for crypt height (μm) and number of cells per crypt height. Cross-section of crypts (20/mouse) were used to determine the average crypt diameter (μm) and circumference (in number of cells). These data were used to calculate cell size (crypt height in μm/crypt height in cell number) and estimate the total cells per crypt (mean cells per crypt column × mean crypt circumference). [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 4500 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were from GE Healthcare. Protein A-agarose and Pefabloc were from Roche Applied Science. Angiotensin II, vasopressin, EGF, and GFI were obtained from Sigma. Gö6983 was from Calbiochem. We used two different antibodies to detect the phosphorylated state of Ser744 and Ser748 in the PKD activation loop. One antibody (anti-Ser(P)-744/Ser(P)-748), obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, was raised against a peptide phosphorylated on serines equivalent to Ser744 and Ser748 of PKD1 but predominantly detects the phosphorylated state of Ser744, as shown originally in our laboratory (16Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A second antibody, obtained from Abcam (ab17945), detects the phosphorylated state of Ser748. The specificity of this antibody was confirmed in our recent study using PKD1 with Ser744 and Ser748 mutated to alanines that could not be phosphorylated (30Jacamo R. Sinnett-Smith J. Rey O. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12877-12887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The two different antibodies were used that recognize the autophosphorylation site Ser916 (PKD1) or Ser876 (PKD2); these were purchased from Millipore (04-787) and Abcam (ab59417). An antibody that detects the C-terminal region of PKD1 and PKD2 (C-20) was from Santa Cruz. All other reagents were from standard suppliers and were of the highest grade commercially available. To determine the kinetics of PKD activation by agonists that stimulate endogenously expressed Gq-coupled receptors in intestinal epithelial IEC-18 cells, cultures of these cells were stimulated for various times (2.5–240 min) with either ANGII (Fig. 1A) or vasopressin (Fig. 1B). Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using an antibody that detects the autophosphorylated state of PKD1 at Ser916 and PKD2 at Ser876. Before stimulation, PKD1 and PKD2 exhibit a very low level of autophosphorylation in IEC-18 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Stimulation of these cells for 2.5 min induced a striking increase in the phosphorylation of a doublet band corresponding to the apparent molecular mass of PKD1 autophosphorylated on Ser916 (upper band, 110 kDa) and PKD2 autophosphorylated on Ser876 (lower band, 105 kDa), respectively. Interestingly, the kinetics of autophosphorylation of PKD1 and PKD2 were strikingly different regardless of the agonist used. The phosphorylation of PKD2 declined rapidly toward base-line levels, whereas that of PKD1 remained elevated for up to 4 h (Fig. 1, A and B). In other experiments, PKD1 phosphorylation on Ser916 was still increased above base-line levels even after 24 h of ANGII stimulation (results not shown). To verify that the doublet band detected in the IEC-18 lysates (shown in Fig. 1) corresponds to PKD1 and PKD2, we knock down the expression of each isoform using siRNAs that target specifically either PKD1 or PKD2. Then, the cells were stimulated for 5, 30, and 120 min with 50 nm ANGII, and Western blot analysis of the lysates was performed using an antibody that detects the autophosphorylated state of PKD1 at Ser916 and PKD2 at Ser876. As shown in Fig. 1C, transfection of siRNA targeting PKD1 produced strik"

Theoretically, this abnormal response can have two origins: an increased proinflammatory response to a bacterial component or a decreased regulatory response, which may lead to an excessive effector immune response. In this context, IBD research has recently focused on identifying organisms or components in the gut microflora that facilitate or thwart one of these disease mechanisms.

Previous studies2,3 were crucial for showing how a particular gut commensal organism, Bacteroides fragilis, which expresses a capsular polysaccharide known as polysaccharide A (PSA), induces an increased immunoregulatory—and protective—response in the colons of normal mice, which is able to lessen colonic inflammation. These studies therefore pointed to a possible way of using this organism, or, more likely, a product of this organism, to treat IBD.

A recent study by Round et al.4 represents the leading edge of this line of research. The authors showed that monocolonization of germ-free mice with B. fragilis induces accumulation of Foxp3+ regulatory cells (Treg cells) in the lamina propria in the gut, which produce increased amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2)4. This effect was entirely dependent on the expression of PSA, as B. fragilis lacking PSA did not have the same inducing effect, and oral administration of PSA in mice resulted in an increased number of Treg cells.

Round et al.4 also showed that Treg cells from PSA-treated mice compared to those from saline-treated mice show a PSA-specific profile with an enhanced capacity to suppress effector T cells in vitro and to express increased levels of Il-10, TGF-β2, granzyme B and CCR6 mRNA. Finally, the authors investigated the possible clinical applicability of these findings, assessing the capacity of PSA to prevent or ‘cure’ 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in wild-type BALB/c mice—an acute and intense T helper type 1 (TH1) T cell (interferon-γ (IFN-γ))-mediated colitis—by oral PSA administration either before the onset of colitis or after inflammation had been established4. Oral PSA administration indeed ameliorated—but did not completely reverse—colitis under both conditions, probably by increasing the number of Treg cells and their anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-β (Fig. 1).

This study of B. fragilis4 is part of a large group of studies that are attempting to define pro- or anti-inflammatory organisms in IBD. Studies focusing on single organisms have shown that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has a protective function, as a reduced number of these bacteria in the intestine was associated with increased post-operative recurrence of Crohn’s disease5. In addition, oral administration of F. prausnitzii or a supernatant derived from this organism decreased the severity of TNBS-induced colitis and associated production of proinflammatory cytokines5. This organism, similarly to B. fragilis, can inhibit gut inflammation, although in this case the inhibitory mechanism is far less clear.

Other studies of single organisms, however, have shown that a subset of people with Crohn’s disease harbor a potentially proinflammatory ‘adherent-invasive’ strain of Escherichia coli in their small intestine6. Although this has been verified by other studies, it remains unclear whether these organisms cause disease or colonize the gut after disease is established7.

Studies of organisms in IBD focusing on the bacterial community as a whole comprise the major effort now underway to define the gut microbiome in humans in general and in IBD in particular. Analyses of bacterial 16S rRNA by microarray probes or studies using sequencing of 16S rRNA in clonal libraries derived from bacteria, among other techniques8–11, showed how individuals with IBD present with depletion of some commensal microbes in the phylogenic divisions Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, including F. prausnitzii and B. fragilis, respectively5,8,11. This finding is congruent with the idea that Crohn’s disease is due to or aggravated by the loss of bacteria that promote regulatory responses, such as B. fragilis; however, the analyses conducted so far have shown that such losses usually involve large groups of organisms rather than specific bacterial strains.

A surprising aspect of the B. fragilis studies was that a specific antigen such as PSA has a remarkable ability to induce Foxp3+ Treg cells. Induction of Treg cells was absent in Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-deficient mice, implying that induction is due to an innate immune response mediated by TLR2. This finding suggests that PSA has a dual function—it stimulates T cells via conventional presentation to the T cell receptor, which then upregulates T cell expression of TLR2 and allows direct PSA stimulation of naive T cells that results in Treg cell differentiation.

Regardless of the mechanism, it is apparent that this polysaccharide could be the basis of a viable IBD therapy. Yet at least two questions must be answered to prove the feasibility of this approach. First, it was shown that PSA not only induces regulatory T cells that protect from IBD but also induces CD4+ T cells to undergo differentiation into IFN-γ–producing cells–TH1 differentiation–which are potentially proinflammatory T cells12. As yet, the conditions that elicit a particular arm of this dichotomous response have not been defined, and it is therefore possible that, in some circumstances, PSA administration will induce a proinflammatory TH1 response, which can exacerbate a preexisting inflammatory disease.

The second question relates to the general idea that induction of Treg cells can treat inflammatory disease. There is now considerable evidence that proinflammatory factors, such as IL-23, which is secreted by APCs in support of TH17 responses, have specific downregulatory effects on Treg cell development13. In addition, Treg cells are considered ‘plastic’, as they can convert into proinflammatory IL-17–secreting cells when they are exposed to IL-6, a cytokine secreted by inflammatory macrophages14.

These facts pose the possibility that robust inflammation, such as that present in IBD, can ‘trump’ an anti-inflammatory Treg cell response induced by PSA, unless the protective Treg cells completely quell an incipient inflammation and prevent countervailing secretion of inhibitory cytokines such as IL-6, a condition not met in the TNBS-induced colitis study discussed above.

It might therefore be prudent to initially test the efficacy of PSA in people who are close to complete remission from disease as a result of previous treatment by surgery or administration of antibodies against inflammatory cytokines, such as antibody to TNF-α or antibody to IL-12 p40, to determine whether treatment with PSA prevents recurrent disease. This approach would obviate problems derived from the presence of cytokines that facilitate PSA induction of TH1 cells or the presence of cytokines that inhibit Treg cell expansion or activity."

Here, we consider the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the post-transcriptional regulation of protein synthesis. To determine their impact on protein concentration, we constructed a mechanistic model consisting of four state variables and nine kinetic parameters that account for transcript sequestration and degradation via miRNA-mRNA complex formation. Our dynamical model predicts that, even when present in low copy number, miRNAs can exert potent effects on protein concentration. Sensitivity analysis of the steady-state solution indicates that miRNA synthesis commonly acts to fine-tune protein concentrations. However, the same analysis shows that for a small subset of miRNA-mRNA pairs characterized by slowly produced miRNAs, the miRNA synthesis rate is the dominant control element. Our model equations provide a tool to evaluate the importance of particular miRNAs on their target proteins and promote the development of miRNA-based therapies that target proteins associated with cancer, inflammation, and metabolic disorders."

HFS given at the onset of the R2 component of the blink reflex (HFS(LTP)) produced a lasting facilitation of the R2, whereas HFS given shortly before R2 (HFS(LTD)) caused a lasting suppression of the R2. In patients with benign essential blepharospasm (BEB), a focal dystonia affecting the orbicularis oculi muscles, HFS(LTP) induced excessive LTP-like associative plasticity relative to healthy controls, which was normalized after botulinum toxin (BTX) injections (Quartarone et al, 2006).We used HFS conditioning of the supraorbital nerve to study homeostatic metaplasticity of the blink reflex circuit in healthy subjects and dystonic patients. On separate days, we tested the conditioning effects on the R2 response and paired-pulse R2 inhibition after (i) HFS(LTP), (ii) HFS(LTP) followed by HFS(LTP), and (iii) HFS(LTP) followed by HFS(LTD). Controls also received (iv) HFS(LTD) alone and (v) a non-intervention protocol. In BEB patients, HFS(LTP) followed by HFS(LTD) was given before and after BTX treatment. We were not able to replicate the bidirectional timing-dependent effects of HFS(LTP) and HFS(LTD) alone. All HFS protocols produced a non-specific reduction of the R2 response and a relative decrease in paired-pulse inhibition. These R2 changes also occurred in controls when no HFS was applied. There was also no trace of a homeostatic response pattern in BEB patients before or after BTX treatment.Our data challenge the efficacy of associative HFS to produce bidirectional plasticity in the human blink reflex circuit. The non-specific decrease of the R2 response might indicate habituation of the blink reflex following repeated electrical supraorbital stimulation. The increase of inhibition after paired pulse stimulation might reflect homeostatic behaviour to prevent further down regulation of the R2 response to preserve the protection of this adverse-effects reflex."

https://openalex.org/W1963963319,"Background The receptor tyrosine kinase Met is involved in the progression and metastasis of numerous human cancers. Although overexpression and autocrine activation of the Met signaling pathway are commonly found in human cancers, mutational activation of Met has been observed in small cell and non-small cell lung cancers, lung adenocarcinomas, renal carcinomas, and mesotheliomas. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the influence of mutationally activated Met in tumorigenesis, we utilized a novel mouse model. Previously, we observed that various Met mutations developed unique mutation-specific tumor spectra on a C57BL/6 background. Here, we assessed the effect of genetic background on the tumorigenic potential of mutationally activated Met. For this purpose, we created congenic knock-in lines of the Met mutations D1226N, M1248T, and Y1228C on the FVB/N background. Consistent with the mutation-specific tumor spectra, several of the mutations were associated with the same tumor types as observed on C57BL/6 background. However, on the FVB/N background most developed a high incidence of mammary carcinomas with diverse histopathologies. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that on two distinct mouse backgrounds, Met is able to initiate tumorigenesis in multiple cell types, including epithelial, hematopoietic, and endothelial. Furthermore, these observations emphasize that even a modest increase in Met activation can initiate tumorigenesis with both the Met mutational spectra and host background having profound influence on the type of tumor generated. Greater insight into the interaction of genetic modifiers and Met signaling will significantly enhance our ability to tailor combination therapies for Met-driven cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2094826743,"Pressure and volume overload induce hypertrophic growth of postnatal cardiomyocytes and genetic reprogramming characterized by reactivation of a subset of fetal genes. Despite intense efforts, the nuclear effectors of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy remain incompletely defined. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays an important role in cardiomyocyte growth and is involved in mediating the neurohormonal effects of mechanical stress. Here, we show that the phenylephrine-induced complex-1 (PEX1), also known as zinc finger transcription factor ZFP260, is essential for cardiomyocyte response to ET-1 as evidenced in cardiomyocytes with PEX1 knockdown. We found that ET-1 enhances PEX1 transcriptional activity via a PKC-dependent pathway which phosphorylates the protein and further potentiates its synergy with GATA4. Consistent with a role for PEX1 in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, overexpression of PEX1 is sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, transgenic mice with inducible PEX1 expression in the adult heart develop cardiac hypertrophy with preserved heart function. Together, the results identify a novel nuclear effector of ET-1 signaling and suggest that PEX1 may be a regulator of the early stages of cardiac hypertrophy."
