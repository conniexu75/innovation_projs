https://openalex.org/W2057005882,"strength of hand preference is approximately equal, and that the proportion of rightand left-handedness is similar in the two species. Finch's more elaborate technique probably provided a more valid measure of hand preference than that of the present study, but there appears to be little evidence for assuming any significant difference in the degree of lateral dominance found in the rhesus monkey and the chimpanzee in so far as the experiments provided accurate measures of handedness in the two species. Kounin (3) has criticized observations of the hand used for picking up food as a test of handedness, since 'unnoticeable posturing and situational expediencies render this task too unreliable for demonstrating the existence of handedness in monkeys. The results of the present investigation, however, suggest that Kounin's Xconclusion, based on very small samples, may perhaps have been prematurely pessimistic."
