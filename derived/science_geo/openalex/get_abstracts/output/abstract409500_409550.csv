https://openalex.org/W2051629075,"Aβ (beta-amyloid peptide) is an important contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We modeled Aβ toxicity in yeast by directing the peptide to the secretory pathway. A genome-wide screen for toxicity modifiers identified the yeast homolog of phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) and other endocytic factors connected to AD whose relationship to Aβ was previously unknown. The factors identified in yeast modified Aβ toxicity in glutamatergic neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans and in primary rat cortical neurons. In yeast, Aβ impaired the endocytic trafficking of a plasma membrane receptor, which was ameliorated by endocytic pathway factors identified in the yeast screen. Thus, links between Aβ, endocytosis, and human AD risk factors can be ascertained with yeast as a model system."
https://openalex.org/W2120335030,"The extensive world-wide morbidity and mortality caused by influenza A viruses highlights the need for new insights into the host immune response and novel treatment approaches. Cationic Host Defense Peptides (CHDP, also known as antimicrobial peptides), which include cathelicidins and defensins, are key components of the innate immune system that are upregulated during infection and inflammation. Cathelicidins have immunomodulatory and anti-viral effects, but their impact on influenza virus infection has not been previously assessed. We therefore evaluated the effect of cathelicidin peptides on disease caused by influenza A virus in mice. The human cathelicidin, LL-37, and the murine cathelicidin, mCRAMP, demonstrated significant anti-viral activity in vivo, reducing disease severity and viral replication in infected mice to a similar extent as the well-characterized influenza virus-specific antiviral drug zanamivir. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggested that the peptides may act directly on the influenza virion rather than via receptor-based mechanisms. Influenza virus-infected mice treated with LL-37 had lower concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung than did infected animals that had not been treated with cathelicidin peptides. These data suggest that treatment of influenza-infected individuals with cathelicidin-derived therapeutics, or modulation of endogenous cathelicidin production may provide significant protection against disease."
https://openalex.org/W1984427878,"Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) is a single-stranded RNA virus with three genome components designated alpha, beta, and gamma. BSMV vectors have previously been shown to be efficient virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) vehicles in barley and wheat and have provided important information about host genes functioning during pathogenesis as well as various aspects of genes functioning in development. To permit more effective use of BSMV VIGS for functional genomics experiments, we have developed an Agrobacterium delivery system for BSMV and have coupled this with a ligation independent cloning (LIC) strategy to mediate efficient cloning of host genes. Infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves provided excellent sources of virus for secondary BSMV infections and VIGS in cereals. The Agro/LIC BSMV VIGS vectors were able to function in high efficiency down regulation of phytoene desaturase (PDS), magnesium chelatase subunit H (ChlH), and plastid transketolase (TK) gene silencing in N. benthamiana and in the monocots, wheat, barley, and the model grass, Brachypodium distachyon. Suppression of an Arabidopsis orthologue cloned from wheat (TaPMR5) also interfered with wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) infections in a manner similar to that of the A. thaliana PMR5 loss-of-function allele. These results imply that the PMR5 gene has maintained similar functions across monocot and dicot families. Our BSMV VIGS system provides substantial advantages in expense, cloning efficiency, ease of manipulation and ability to apply VIGS for high throughput genomics studies."
https://openalex.org/W2030862217,"Bluetongue virus is the ""type"" species of the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. Twenty four distinct bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes have been recognized for decades, any of which is thought to be capable of causing ""bluetongue"" (BT), an insect-borne disease of ruminants. However, two further BTV serotypes, BTV-25 (Toggenburg orbivirus, from Switzerland) and BTV-26 (from Kuwait) have recently been identified in goats and sheep, respectively. The BTV genome is composed of ten segments of linear dsRNA, encoding 7 virus-structural proteins (VP1 to VP7) and four distinct non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1 to NS4). We report the entire BTV-26 genome sequence (isolate KUW2010/02) and comparisons to other orbiviruses. Highest identity levels were consistently detected with other BTV strains, identifying KUW2010/02 as BTV. The outer-core protein and major BTV serogroup-specific antigen ""VP7"" showed 98% aa sequence identity with BTV-25, indicating a common ancestry. However, higher level of variation in the nucleotide sequence of Seg-7 (81.2% identity) suggests strong conservation pressures on the protein of these two strains, and that they diverged a long time ago. Comparisons of Seg-2, encoding major outer-capsid component and cell-attachment protein ""VP2"" identified KUW2010/02 as 26th BTV, within a 12th Seg-2 nucleotype [nucleotype L]. Comparisons of Seg-6, encoding the smaller outer capsid protein VP5, also showed levels of nt/aa variation consistent with identification of KUW2010/02 as BTV-26 (within a 9th Seg-6 nucleotype - nucleotype I). Sequence data for Seg-2 of KUW2010/02 were used to design four sets of oligonucleotide primers for use in BTV-26, type-specific RT-PCR assays. Analyses of other more conserved genome segments placed KUW2010/02 and BTV-25/SWI2008/01 closer to each other than to other ""eastern"" or ""western"" BTV strains, but as representatives of two novel and distinct geographic groups (topotypes). Our analyses indicate that all of the BTV genome segments have evolved under strong purifying selection."
https://openalex.org/W2077606253,"Vitamin B1 (thiamin) was the first vitamin to be discovered more than a century ago, but some of the details of its biosynthesis remain unclear because of the complexity and novelty of this process. In yeast, the protein THI4p catalyses the assembly of the thiazole moiety of vitamin B1 in a complex reaction involving the conversion of NAD, glycine and sulphide to an adenylated carboxythiazole phosphate. The source of the sulphide and the mechanism by which it is incorporated into the thiazole is not known. Chatterjee et al. now report the first full reconstitution of THI4p-catalysed thiamin thiazole biosynthesis. They show that a conserved cysteine residue of THI4p acts as the source of sulphur, meaning that this protein is in fact a co-substrate of the biosynthetic pathway. THI4p can do this only once, so that it is a cofactor or 'suicide enzyme' rather that a true multi-turnover enzyme. Thiamine pyrophosphate 1 is an essential cofactor in all living systems1. Its biosynthesis involves the separate syntheses of the pyrimidine 2 and thiazole 3 precursors, which are then coupled2. Two biosynthetic routes to the thiamine thiazole have been identified. In prokaryotes, five enzymes act on three substrates to produce the thiazole via a complex oxidative condensation reaction, the mechanistic details of which are now well established2,3,4,5,6. In contrast, only one gene product is involved in thiazole biosynthesis in eukaryotes (THI4p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae)7. Here we report the preparation of fully active recombinant wild-type THI4p, the identification of an iron-dependent sulphide transfer reaction from a conserved cysteine residue of the protein to a reaction intermediate and the demonstration that THI4p is a suicide enzyme undergoing only a single turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2072350275,"We describe a protocol for fully automated detection and segmentation of asymmetric, presumed excitatory, synapses in serial electron microscopy images of the adult mammalian cerebral cortex, taken with the focused ion beam, scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM). The procedure is based on interactive machine learning and only requires a few labeled synapses for training. The statistical learning is performed on geometrical features of 3D neighborhoods of each voxel and can fully exploit the high z-resolution of the data. On a quantitative validation dataset of 111 synapses in 409 images of 1948×1342 pixels with manual annotations by three independent experts the error rate of the algorithm was found to be comparable to that of the experts (0.92 recall at 0.89 precision). Our software offers a convenient interface for labeling the training data and the possibility to visualize and proofread the results in 3D. The source code, the test dataset and the ground truth annotation are freely available on the website http://www.ilastik.org/synapse-detection."
https://openalex.org/W2089281646,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive paralyzing disease characterized by tissue oxidative damage and motor neuron degeneration. This study investigated the in vivo effect of diacetylbis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazonato) copper(II) (CuII(atsm)), which is an orally bioavailable, blood-brain barrier-permeable complex. In vitro the compound inhibits the action of peroxynitrite on Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and subsequent nitration of cellular proteins. Oral treatment of transgenic SOD1G93A mice with CuII(atsm) at presymptomatic and symptomatic ages was performed. The mice were examined for improvement in lifespan and motor function, as well as histological and biochemical changes to key disease markers. Systemic treatment of SOD1G93A mice significantly delayed onset of paralysis and prolonged lifespan, even when administered to symptomatic animals. Consistent with the properties of this compound, treated mice had reduced protein nitration and carbonylation, as well as increased antioxidant activity in spinal cord. Treatment also significantly preserved motor neurons and attenuated astrocyte and microglial activation in mice. Furthermore, CuII(atsm) prevented the accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated and fragmented TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) in spinal cord, a protein pivotal to the development of ALS. CuII(atsm) therefore represents a potential new class of neuroprotective agents targeting multiple major disease pathways of motor neurons with therapeutic potential for ALS."
https://openalex.org/W1992978123,"Several recently published studies have suggested that decreasing VEGF levels result in placental oxidative stress in preeclampsia, although the question as to how decreased VEGF concentrations increase oxidative stress still remains unanswered. Here, we show that VEGF activated Nrf2, the main regulating factor of the intracellular redox balance, in the cytotrophic cell line BeWo. In turn, this activated the production of antioxidative enzymes thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and heme oxygenase-1, which showed a decrease in their expression in the placentas of preeclamptic women. Nevertheless, this activation occurred without oxidative stress stimulus. As a consequence, the activation of Nrf2 protected BeWo cells against H2O2/Fe2+-induced oxidative damage. We further show that VEGF up-regulated the expression of itself. A positive feedback loop was described in which VEGF activated Nrf2 in an ERK1/2-dependent manner; the up-regulation of HO-1 expression by Nrf2 augmented the production of carbon monoxide, which in turn up-regulated VEGF expression. In conclusion, VEGF induces the Nrf2 pathway to protect against oxidative stress and, via a positive feedback loop, to elevate VEGF expression. Therefore, decreased VEGF bioavailability during preeclampsia may result in higher vulnerability to placental oxidative cell damage and a further reduction of VEGF bioavailability, a vicious circle that may end up in preeclampsia.

https://openalex.org/W2050874028,"TAC3/TACR3 mutations have been reported in normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nCHH) (OMIM #146110). In the absence of animal models, studies of human neuroendocrine phenotypes associated with neurokinin B and NK3R receptor dysfunction can help to decipher the pathophysiology of this signaling pathway.To evaluate the prevalence of TAC3/TACR3 mutations, characterize novel TACR3 mutations and to analyze neuroendocrine profiles in nCHH caused by deleterious TAC3/TACR3 biallelic mutations.From a cohort of 352 CHH, we selected 173 nCHH patients and identified nine patients carrying TAC3 or TACR3 variants (5.2%). We describe here 7 of these TACR3 variants (1 frameshift and 2 nonsense deleterious mutations and 4 missense variants) found in 5 subjects. Modeling and functional studies of the latter demonstrated the deleterious consequence of one missense mutation (Tyr267Asn) probably caused by the misfolding of the mutated NK3R protein. We found a statistically significant (p<0.0001) higher mean FSH/LH ratio in 11 nCHH patients with TAC3/TACR3 biallelic mutations than in 47 nCHH patients with either biallelic mutations in KISS1R, GNRHR, or with no identified mutations and than in 50 Kallmann patients with mutations in KAL1, FGFR1 or PROK2/PROKR2. Three patients with TAC3/TACR3 biallelic mutations had an apulsatile LH profile but low-frequency alpha-subunit pulses. Pulsatile GnRH administration increased alpha-subunit pulsatile frequency and reduced the FSH/LH ratio.The gonadotropin axis dysfunction associated with nCHH due to TAC3/TACR3 mutations is related to a low GnRH pulsatile frequency leading to a low frequency of alpha-subunit pulses and to an elevated FSH/LH ratio. This ratio might be useful for pre-screening nCHH patients for TAC3/TACR3 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1978775652,"Galectin-3 (Gal 3) is a glycan-binding protein that can be secreted by activated macrophages and mast cells at inflammation sites and plays an important role in inflammatory diseases caused by Bacteria and their products, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Although it is well established that Gal 3 can interact with LPS, the pathophysiological importance of LPS/Gal 3 interactions is not fully understood. Data presented herein demonstrate for the first time that the interaction of Gal 3, either via its carbohydrate binding C-terminal domain or via its N-terminal part, with LPS from different bacterial strains, enhances the LPS-mediated neutrophil activation in vitro. Gal 3 allowed low LPS concentrations (1 µg/mL without serum, 1 ng/mL with serum) to upregulate CD11b expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation on human neutrophils in vitro and drastically enhanced the binding efficiency of LPS to the neutrophil surface. These effects required LPS preincubation with Gal 3, before neutrophil stimulation and involved specific Gal 3/LPS interaction. A C-terminal Gal-3 fragment, which retains the lectin domain but lacks the N-terminal part, was still able to bind both to Escherichia coli LPS and to neutrophils, but had lost the ability to enhance neutrophil response to LPS. This result emphasizes the importance of an N-terminus-mediated Gal 3 oligomerization induced by its interaction with LPS. Finally we demonstrated that Balb/C mice were more susceptible to LPS-mediated shock when LPS was pretreated with Gal 3. Altogether, these results suggest that multimeric interactions between Gal 3 oligomers and LPS potentiate its pro-inflammatory effects on neutrophils."

Loss of synapses and synaptic dysfunction are closely associated with cognitive impairment in AD patients. Biochemical and pathological evidence suggests that soluble Aβ oligomers correlate with cognitive impairment. Here, we used the TgCRND8 AD mouse model to investigate the role of JNK in long term memory deficits. TgCRND8 mice were chronically treated with the cell-penetrating c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor peptide (D-JNKI1). D-JNKI1, preventing JNK action, completely rescued memory impairments (behavioral studies) as well as the long term potentiation deficits of TgCRND8 mice. Moreover, D-JNKI1 inhibited APP phosphorylation in Thr-668 and reduced the amyloidogenic cleavage of APP and Aβ oligomers in brain parenchyma of treated mice. In conclusion, by regulating key pathogenic mechanisms of AD, JNK might hold promise as innovative therapeutic target.

https://openalex.org/W2090759673,"The tumor suppressor protein Pdcd4 is thought to suppress translation of mRNAs containing structured 5'-UTRs by interacting with translation initiation factor eIF4A and inhibiting its helicase activity. However, natural target mRNAs regulated by Pdcd4 so far are mostly unknown. Here, we identified p53 mRNA as a translational target of Pdcd4. We found that Pdcd4 is associated with p53 mRNA and suppresses its translation. The inhibitory effect of Pdcd4 on the translation of p53 mRNA depends on the ability of Pdcd4 to interact with eIF4A and is mediated by the 5'-UTR of p53 mRNA, which is able to form a stable stem-loop structure. We show that treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents decreases the expression of Pdcd4. This suggests that translational suppression by Pdcd4 plays a role in maintaining a low level of p53 in unstressed cells and that this suppression is abrogated due to low levels of Pdcd4 after DNA damage. Overall, our work demonstrates for the first time that Pdcd4 is directly involved in translational suppression of a natural mRNA with a 5'-structured UTR and provides novel insight into the translational control of p53 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1968069981,"Tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells mediate the permeability of the intestinal barrier, and loss of intestinal barrier function mediated by TNF signaling is associated with the inflammatory pathophysiology observed in Crohn's disease and celiac disease. Thus, factors that modulate intestinal epithelial cell response to TNF may be critical for the maintenance of barrier function. TNF alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) is a cytosolic protein that acts in a negative feedback loop to regulate cell signaling induced by Toll-like receptor ligands and TNF, suggesting that TNFAIP3 may play a role in regulating the intestinal barrier. To investigate the specific role of TNFAIP3 in intestinal barrier function we assessed barrier permeability in TNFAIP3(-/-) mice and LPS-treated villin-TNFAIP3 transgenic mice. TNFAIP3(-/-) mice had greater intestinal permeability compared to wild-type littermates, while villin-TNFAIP3 transgenic mice were protected from increases in permeability seen within LPS-treated wild-type littermates, indicating that barrier permeability is controlled by TNFAIP3. In cultured human intestinal epithelial cell lines, TNFAIP3 expression regulated both TNF-induced and myosin light chain kinase-regulated tight junction dynamics but did not affect myosin light chain kinase activity. Immunohistochemistry of mouse intestine revealed that TNFAIP3 expression inhibits LPS-induced loss of the tight junction protein occludin from the apical border of the intestinal epithelium. We also found that TNFAIP3 deubiquitinates polyubiquitinated occludin. These in vivo and in vitro studies support the role of TNFAIP3 in promoting intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and demonstrate its novel ability to maintain intestinal homeostasis through tight junction protein regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2111928246,"Light absorbed by colored intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis is not utilized in photosynthesis; instead, it is transferred to molecular oxygen, generating singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)). As there is no enzymatic detoxification mechanism available in plants to destroy (1)O(2), its generation should be minimized. We manipulated the concentration of a major chlorophyll biosynthetic intermediate i.e., protochlorophyllide in Arabidopsis by overexpressing the light-inducible protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase C (PORC) that effectively phototransforms endogenous protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide leading to minimal accumulation of the photosensitizer protochlorophyllide in light-grown plants. In PORC overexpressing (PORCx) plants exposed to high-light, the (1)O(2) generation and consequent malonedialdehyde production was minimal and the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II remained unaffected demonstrating that their photosynthetic apparatus and cellular organization were intact. Further, PORCx plants treated with 5-aminolevulinicacid when exposed to light, photo-converted over-accumulated protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide, reduced the generation of (1)O(2) and malonedialdehyde production and reduced plasma membrane damage. So PORCx plants survived and bolted whereas, the 5-aminolevulinicacid-treated wild-type plants perished. Thus, overexpression of PORC could be biotechnologically exploited in crop plants for tolerance to (1)O(2)-induced oxidative stress, paving the use of 5-aminolevulinicacid as a selective commercial light-activated biodegradable herbicide. Reduced protochlorophyllide content in PORCx plants released the protochlorophyllide-mediated feed-back inhibition of 5-aminolevulinicacid biosynthesis that resulted in higher 5-aminolevulinicacid production. Increase of 5-aminolevulinicacid synthesis upregulated the gene and protein expression of several downstream chlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes elucidating a regulatory net work of expression of genes involved in 5-aminolevulinicacid and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis."

Hst 5 kills fungal cells following intracellular translocation, although its selective transport mechanism is unknown. C. albicans cells grown in the presence of polyamines were resistant to Hst 5 due to reduced intracellular uptake, suggesting that this cationic peptide may enter candidal cells through native yeast polyamine transporters. Based upon homology to known Saccharomyces cerevisiae polyamine permeases, we identified six C. albicans Dur polyamine transporter family members and propose a new nomenclature. Gene deletion mutants were constructed for C. albicans polyamine transporters Dur3, Dur31, Dur33, Dur34, and were tested for Hst 5 sensitivity and uptake of spermidine. We found spermidine uptake and Hst 5 mediated killing were decreased significantly in Δdur3, Δdur31, and Δdur3/Δdur31 strains; whereas a DUR3 overexpression strain increased Hst 5 sensitivity and higher spermidine uptake. Treatment of cells with a spermidine synthase inhibitor increased spermidine uptake and Hst 5 killing, whereas protonophores and cold treatment reduced spermidine uptake. Inhibition assays showed that Hst 5 is a competitive analog of spermidine for uptake into C. albicans cells, and that Hst 5 Ki values were increased by 80-fold in Δdur3/Δdur31 cells.

Human saliva is the source of most innate host defense proteins within the oral cavity. Salivary proteins play a key role in modulating the oral flora and preventing overgrowth of Candida albicans.

Many cationic antimicrobial peptides have the capacity to form amphipathic structures (5Hancock R.E. Lehrer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). These peptides generally exert their activity through spontaneous insertion into microbial membranes by forming pores, and disrupting cell structure and integrity (6Lear J.D. Wasserman Z.R.

However, Hst 5 does not act as a pore forming protein as it has no defined secondary structure in aqueous solutions such as saliva (8Brewer D. Hunter H. Lajoie G. Biochem.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1475: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), showing that the degree of the amphipathic molecular moment is not involved in its fungicidal activity. Furthermore, synthetic variants of Hst 5 with increased (dhvar4) and decreased (dhvar5) amphipathic features both killed C. albicans (11Ruissen A.L. Groenink J. Helmerhorst E.J. Walgreen-Weterings E.

Indeed, Hst 5 can kill C. albicans when expressed from a chromosomally encoded human Hst 5 gene in the absence of externally applied Hsts (18Baev D. Li X. Edgerton M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3323-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Histatin binding with the cell wall and its intracellular translocation are two independent events, although a threshold level of cell wall binding is a requirement for subsequent uptake (17Jang W.S. Bajwa J.S. Sun J.N. Edgerton M. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 354-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The independence of these two processes is illustrated by the complete blockade of intracellular transport of a modified Hst 5 fragment (substituting two key lysine residues), although high levels of cell wall binding were retained (4Jang W.S. Li X.S. Sun J.N. Edgerton M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2008; 52: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus fungal cell wall binding in itself does not result in uptake of histatins, instead a second independent process is required for its passage into the cytosol. Intracellular translocation of histatins is inhibited by low temperatures (19Xu Y. Ambudkar I. Yamagishi H. Swaim W. Walsh T.J. O'Connell B.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2256-2262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or pretreatment of cells with proton ionophores including carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and dinitrophenol or energy metabolism inhibitors such as sodium azide (14Koshlukova S.E. Lloyd T.L. Araujo M.W. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18872-18879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that azide blocks Hst 5 internalization by cell membrane rigidification due to ATP depletion (20Veerman E.C. Valentijn-Benz M. Nazmi K. Ruissen A.L. Walgreen-Weterings E. van Marle J. Doust A.B. van't Hof W. Bolscher J.G. Amerongen A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18831-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), two other energy-dependent mechanisms for intracellular transport are possible including endocytosis and active transport of histatin through a cellular transporter. Indeed, Hst 5 is internalized by endocytotic transport to the vacuole (21Mochon A.B. Liu H. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4e1000190Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), although substantial levels of cytosolic Hst 5 are found prior to endocytotic uptake (17Jang W.S. Bajwa J.S. Sun J.N. Edgerton M. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 354-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Vacuolar sequestration of Hst 5 does not reduce its toxicity (17Jang W.S. Bajwa J.S. Sun J.N. Edgerton M. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 354-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), most likely because high levels of cytosolic peptide are attained before endocytosis occurs. Collectively these data show that rapid translocation of Hst 5 across the fungal cell membrane is required for toxicity, and that this process involves cellular metabolic energy and a proton motive force (as well as ambient temperature), all consistent with an active transport mechanism. Various membrane-bound transport proteins belonging to ABC (ATP binding cassette) or major facilitator superfamily families have been well described for both C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (22Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bauer B.E. Wolfger H. Kuchler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 24Pasrija R. Banerjee D. Prasad R. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These transporters are involved in the uptake of amino acids, peptides, sugar molecules, as well as efflux of azole- and polyene-based antifungal drugs (25Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 26Sanglard D. Ischer F. Calabrese D. Majcherczyk P.A. Bille J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2753-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jungwirth H. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Typically active transporters have a relatively narrow substrate specificity, thus we hypothesized that polyamine transporters (such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) that catalyze the uptake of polycationic molecules may also translocate Hsts as polycationic substrates. Polyamines are essential organic cations required for protein and nucleic acid synthesis and therefore cell growth. Putrescine is a diamine precursor of the larger molecules spermidine and spermine that are synthesized by the aminopropyl transferases spermidine and spermine synthases, respectively (28Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Despite structural variations, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine all carry a net positive charge (pKa values of 9–10) similar to Hst 5. Fungal cells tightly regulate their intracellular concentration of polyamines by balancing biosynthesis and degradation with cellular polyamine transport (both uptake and efflux). Because membrane transporters are major regulators of polyamine homeostasis, they have been studied as drug targets in bacteria (29Woolridge D.P. Vazquez-Laslop N. Markham P.N. Chevalier M.S. Gerner E.W. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8864-8866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Shah P. Briles D.E. King J. Hale Y. Swiatio E. Exp. Biol. Med. 2009; 234: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and more recently in S. cerevisiae (31Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Four plasma membrane-localized polyamine transporters in S. cerevisiae have been characterized: Gap1, Agp2, Dur3, and Sam3 (32Aouida M. Leduc A. Poulin R. Ramotar D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24267-24276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7733-7741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The amino acid permeases Gap1 and Agp2 catalyze the uptake of smaller polyamines (primarily putrescine and to a lesser degree spermidine) as well as amino acids. Both Gap1 and Agp2 preferentially transport amino acids rather than polyamines when both are present in the media. In contrast, Dur3 and Sam3 are polyamine-preferential transporters that catalyze the uptake of polyamines, although they may also transport urea (Dur3), or S-adenosylmethionine, glutamic acid, and lysine (SAM3) (34Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7733-7741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Polyamine uptake is repressed by high intracellular levels of polyamines at a transcriptional level as illustrated by the reduction in DUR3 and SAM3 mRNA in cells cultured in the presence of polyamines. A decrease in putrescine uptake in S. cerevisiae cells was comparable with the reduction in mRNA levels of DUR3 and SAM3, thus showing the tight regulation of polyamine uptake proteins Dur3 and Sam3 with polyamine concentrations in S. cerevisiae (34Uemura T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7733-7741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was expected that C. albicans cells grown in the presence of high concentrations of polyamines would have reduced uptake of polyamine substrates including Hst 5. We report here that C. albicans has reduced intracellular transport of Hst 5 upon growth in medium rich in spermidine, implicating polyamine transporters in uptake of this peptide. The identity of polyamine transporter proteins is relatively well defined in S. cerevisiae, however, virtually nothing is known about these proteins or their regulation of polyamine transport in C. albicans. Thus, the aims of the present study were to identify polyamine transporters in C. albicans, with the goal of gaining insight into the mode of Hst 5 intracellular translocation by cells, as we hypothesized that Hst 5 is a polycationic molecule recognized as a substrate for polyamine transporters. Indeed, we identified a novel Dur family of transporter proteins in C. albicans that catalyze spermidine uptake, with Dur3 and Dur31 proteins being the primary carriers for intracellular translocation of Hst 5. The study provides novel understanding of how Hst 5 enters C. albicans cells to exert its fungicidal activity, and is invaluable information for designing new therapeutic agents with improved cellular uptake. The strains generated by this study and their genotypes are listed in Table 1. The ura3− auxotrophic C. albicans CAF4-2 strain (35Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was the parental strain for DUR gene deletion mutants. Yeast carbon base (Sigma) was used for induction of FLP-mediated excision of the URA3 flipper cassette. Yeast nitrogen base (Difco) without uridine and supplemented with 2% glucose was used for selection of the URA3+ transformants. Cells were maintained in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD; Difco) medium with the addition of uridine when required and stored as −78 °C stock. For routine work, the strains were maintained on YPD agar plates and recultured monthly from −78 °C stock. Cells were routinely manipulated at 28 °C to maintain the cells in blastospore morphology. Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen) were used as a host for plasmids and were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Difco). Solid media were made with 1.8% Bacto-agar (Difco). All oligonucleotides used in strain constructions were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Restriction endonucleases and GeneRuler DNA markers were purchased from Fermentas. The Fast-Link DNA ligation kit was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli by the alkaline lysis method, employing a QIAprep Spin miniprep kit from Qiagen. Purification of restriction digest mixtures, PCR mixtures, and DNA fragment isolation from agarose gels were done by using QIAquick PCR purification and QIAquick gel extraction kits, respectively, both from Qiagen. Genomic DNA of C. albicans strain was isolated by PUREGENE DNA isolation kit from Qiagen. Ampicillin, fluoroorotic acid, and concanavalin A were purchased from Sigma at the highest purity available. Polyamines (putrescine dihydrochloride, spermidine trihydrochloride, and spermine tetrahydrochloride) were obtained from Sigma. Unlabeled Hst 5 (DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGY) and N terminus FITC-labeled Hst 5 were synthesized by GeneMed Synthesis, Inc. (San Antonio, TX).TABLE 1C. albicans strains used in this studyStrainParentGenotypePhenotypeReferenceCAF4-2CAF2-1Δura3::imm434/ura3::imm434URA−35Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y.

Michel S. Staib P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was used to replace the first allele of each DUR gene. The pSFUC2 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. J. Morschhauser) containing two FRT sites, a SAP2 promoter-driven FLP gene and a URA3 marker, was used as the starting vector. The 5′-flanking sequence from DUR3, DUR31, DUR33, and DUR34 genes was subcloned and ligated with the KpnI- and XhoI-digested plasmid. The constructed plasmids containing the 5′-flanking region of DUR genes were confirmed by PCR. Fragments including 3′-flanking sequence, spanning the untranslated region of DUR genes, were digested by BglII and SacI and ligated into the plasmid containing 5′-flanking region of the respective DUR gene. Insertion of DUR genes into the vector was confirmed by restriction digestion and PCR. For deletion of the second allele of the DUR genes, the pDBU3 plasmid (∼5.1 kb), containing 2.37 kb length of the URA3 open reading frame, was used as a starting vector. The strategy used was as described above. In addition to the 5′- and 3′-second target sequences (STR) of the DUR gene (5′ STR and 3′ STR), a second 3′-target region (3′ STR-2) amplified from the sequence immediately downstream of the first 3′-STR was added. The PCR product of 3′ STR-2 was introduced into the vector between the 5′ STR and URA3 marker. This additional flanking region served as the recognition site for fluoroorotic acid-induced intra-chromosomal recombination. The final gene disruption constructs were used to target the second allele of DUR genes. Gene deletion strains were constructed for DUR genes to characterize CaDUR gene products in Hst 5 induced killing. Because of the diploid genome of C. albicans, a combination of two genetic strategies was employed to sequentially remove both alleles of DUR genes. To inactivate the first allele of DUR genes, C. albicans strain CAF4-2 was first transformed with linearized pUFC plasmid containing flanking regions of the DUR gene using the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II KitTM (Zymo Research, CA). Transformed cells were spread onto uracil-deficient agar plates. Candida genomic DNA was isolated, and integration of the gene disruption cassette was confirmed by PCR with control primers. Selected transformants were grown on yeast carbon base/BSA medium for induction of FLP-mediated excision of the UFC (36Morschhäuser J. Michel S. Staib P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Randomly selected ura− colonies were analyzed using PCR. The heterozygous strain of DUR genes was further transformed with a linearized fragment of pURA to obtain homozygous DUR gene knock-out mutant strains. Successful replacement of the second allele of the DUR genes was confirmed by PCR. Selected colonies were spread onto yeast nitrogen base-agar plates containing fluoroorotic acid (1 mg/ml) and uridine (50 μg/ml) to induce intra-chromosomal recombination and eliminate colonies containing the URA3 gene. For additional deletion of DUR genes, these mutants were transformed with another series of cassettes. To construct a strain overexpressing the Dur3 protein (DUR3 O/E), one copy of DUR3 was placed at the RPS10 locus in WT cells for its constitutive expression. Details of gene deletion strains are listed in Table 1. Amino acid sequences of Dur proteins were obtained from the Candida genome data base and used for sequence alignment by ClustalX version 2.0.11 (37Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22511) Google Scholar). These profiles were used to calculate a phylogenetic tree with use of the neighbor joining algorithm (38Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Graphical representation and editing of the phylogenetic tree was performed using PhyloDraw version 0.82 (39Choi J.H. Jung H.Y. Kim H.S. Cho H.G. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Transmembrane domains were predicted for Dur proteins and visual models were constructed using TMHMM version 2.0 (40Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9080) Google Scholar) and TMRPres2D version 0.93 (41Spyropoulos I.C. Liakopoulos T.D. Bagos P.G. Hamodrakas S.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 3258-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The conserved domains within the predicted amino acid sequences were identified using the PFAM data base (42Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Böckler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V. Lassmann T. Moxon S. Marshall M. Khanna A. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A.

The amine-reactive BODIPY® 630/650 succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen) containing an additional 7-atom aminohexanoyl spacer (“X”) was used to label spermidine. Spermidine was acylated using BODIPY 630/650-X with stirring for 2 h at 4 °C in dimethyl sulfoxide, while keeping it protected from light. BODIPY-X-spermidine (Spd) was purified using Sephadex G-25 column chromatography with dimethyl sulfoxide/sterile-distilled water (1:3). Pooled fractions of purified BODIPY-Spd were assayed for protein content and stored at −80 °C. Wild-type (CAF4-2) and mutant strains were inoculated in YPD broth supplemented with uridine, and incubated at 30 °C with shaking overnight. Cells were subcultured and grown to mid-log phase, washed twice in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (NaPB, pH 7.4), and the cell number was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/50 μl of NaPB. Cells were used immediately in assays performed on 96-well, clear bottom, black plates and handled in subdued lighting. Upon optimization, 100 μm BODIPY-Spd was used in uptake and competition assays, as this concentration allowed for saturation of polyamine transporters and consistent competition with 15.5 and 31 μm Hst 5. A standard curve of fluorescence intensities for known amounts of BODIPY-Spd was determined with a linear range (R2 = 0.9899) between 3.5 and 10 nmol of BODIPY-Spd. For all assays, 1 × 106 cells were added to each well of the assay plate as appropriate, with a total reaction volume of 100 μl/well. BODIPY-Spd was added to the cells immediately before recording fluorescent counts at 30 °C using the Bio-Tek multifunction plate reader and Gen5 software provided by the University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences Confocal Microscopy and Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Readings were taken at 1-min intervals from 0 to 15 min. The cellular uptake of BODIPY-Spd resulted in a decrease in fluorescence, which was normalized by subtraction from the fluorescent count values from the control wells containing only BODIPY-Spd as well as from the readings at time 0. For Hst 5 competition assays, 100 μm BODIPY-Spd was added 1.5 min after the addition of 15.5 μm Hst 5 to the cells that allowed Hst 5 to access the transporters before high affinity saturation with spermidine. To determine the Km, Vmax, and Ki values, uptake as well as competition assays were performed at different concentrations of BODIPY-Spd and Hst 5. Statistical analysis and determination of kinetic parameters were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). C. albicans CAF4-2, Δdur3, and DUR3 O/E cells were treated with FITC-labeled Hst 5 (F-Hst 5) to observe relative binding and uptake of salivary Hst 5. Overnight grown cells (A600 ∼ 0.8–1.0) were diluted to obtain 106 cells/ml of NaPB. The chambered coverglass (Lab-TekII) was coated with 100 μg/ml of concanavalin A for 30 min and washed twice with water. Cells (1 × 106) were fixed on concanavalin A-coated slides for 20 min at room temperature. The plates were then washed twice with NaPB followed by addition of 31 μm FITC-Hst 5 and images were captured under Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) using a Plan Apochromat ×63/1.4 (oil) objective. The average fluorescence intensity was calculated using ImageJ software. A similar procedure was used for competition assays with CAF4-2 and Δdur3 cells where 2 mm spermidine was added in test samples in addition to 31 μm FITC-Hst 5. Confocal images of cells were captured and compared to determine the relative binding and uptake of Hst 5. For candidacidal assays, single colonies of C. albicans wild-type and mutant cells were inoculated in YPD media to A600 of 1.6–1.8. For polyamine growth assays, cells were grown in the YPD media supplemented with different concentrations of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine). For selective polyamine biosynthesis inhibition, 5 mm cyclohexylamine (CHA) was used as spermidine synthesis inhibitor. Overnight grown cells were diluted to A600 = 0.3–0.4 and were incubated at 28 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until A600 of ∼1.0 was attained. We did not observe any growth inhibition in the presence of CHA. Ce"

In addition, the impact of therapies targeting mast cells proliferation, differentiation and degranulation on psychic symptoms of depression have never been investigated. Our objective was to determine the prevalence and to describe features of depression in a large cohort of mastocytosis patients (n = 288) and to investigate the therapeutic impact of the protein kinase inhibitor masitinib in depression symptoms. The description of depression was based on the analysis of a database with Hamilton scores using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Efficacy of masitinib therapy was evaluated using non parametric Wilcoxon test for paired data within a three months period (n = 35). Our results show that patients with indolent mastocytosis present an elevated prevalence of depression (64%). Depression was moderate in 56% but severe in 8% of cases. Core symptoms (such as psychic anxiety, depressed mood, work and interests) characterized depression in mastocytosis patients. Masitinib therapy was associated with significant improvement (67% of the cases) of overall depression, with 75% of recovery cases. Global Quality of Life slightly improved after masitinib therapy and did not predicted depression improvement. In conclusion, depression is very frequent in mastocytosis patients and masitinib therapy is associated with the reduction its psychic experiences. We conclude that depression in mastocytosis may originate from processes related to mast cells activation. Masitinib could therefore be a useful treatment for mastocytosis patients with depression and anxiety symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W1985670699,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a chemokine secreted by neurons and astrocytes following stroke is known to aggravate ischemia-related damage. Previous studies revealed that MCP-1-deficient mice develop smaller infarcts and have an improved neurological outcome, whereas mice overexpressing MCP-1 show worsened brain damage and impaired neurological function. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular background of the enhanced recovery in MCP-1-deficient mice after stroke. For this purpose, we (1) performed expression analyses on crucial post-stroke related inflammatory genes in MCP-1-deficient mice compared to wildtype controls, (2) analyzed a possible impact of MCP-1 on astrocyte activation (3) investigated the cellular origin of respective inflammatory cytokines and (4) analyzed the impact of MCP-1 secretion on the migration of both neutrophil granulocytes and T-cells. Here we report that MCP-1-deficiency leads to a shift towards a less inflammatory state following experimental occlusion of the middle cerebral artery including an impaired induction of interleukin-6, interleukin-1β and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor expression as well as a subsequent diminished influx of hematogenous cells. Additionally, MCP-1-deficient mice developed smaller infarcts 36 hours after experimental stroke. Investigations revealed no differences in transcription of tumor necrosis factor-α and astrogliosis 12 and 36 hours after onset of ischemia. These novel results help to understand post ischemic, inflammatory mechanisms and might give further arguments towards therapeutical interventions by modulation of MCP-1 expression in post stroke inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2009889590,"Ivermectin is an anthelmintic drug that works by activating glutamate-gated chloride channel receptors (GluClRs) in nematode parasites. GluClRs belong to the Cys-loop receptor family that also includes glycine receptor (GlyR) chloride channels. GluClRs and A288G mutant GlyRs are both activated by low nanomolar ivermectin concentrations. The crystal structure of the Caenorhabditis elegans α GluClR complexed with ivermectin has recently been published. Here, we probed ivermectin sensitivity determinants on the α1 GlyR using site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology. Based on a mutagenesis screen of transmembrane residues, we identified Ala288 and Pro230 as crucial sensitivity determinants. A comparison of the actions of selamectin and ivermectin suggested the benzofuran C05-OH was required for high efficacy. When taken together with docking simulations, these results supported a GlyR ivermectin binding orientation similar to that seen in the GluClR crystal structure. However, whereas the crystal structure shows that ivermectin interacts with the α GluClR via H-bonds with Leu218, Ser260, and Thr285 (α GluClR numbering), our data indicate that H-bonds with residues homologous to Ser260 and Thr285 are not important for high ivermectin sensitivity or direct agonist efficacy in A288G α1 GlyRs or three other GluClRs. Our data also suggest that van der Waals interactions between the ivermectin disaccharide and GlyR M2-M3 loop residues are unimportant for high ivermectin sensitivity. Thus, although our results corroborate the ivermectin binding orientation as revealed by the crystal structure, they demonstrate that some of the binding interactions revealed by this structure do not pertain to other highly ivermectin-sensitive Cys-loop receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2082156652,"Pancreatic islet β-cells produce large amounts of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is co-released with insulin. GABA inhibits glucagon secretion by hyperpolarizing α-cells via type-A GABA receptors (GABA(A)Rs). We and others recently reported that islet β-cells also express GABA(A)Rs and that activation of GABA(A)Rs increases insulin release. Here we investigate the effects of insulin on the GABA-GABA(A)R system in the pancreatic INS-1 cells using perforated-patch recording. The results showed that GABA produces a rapid inward current and depolarizes INS-1 cells. However, pre-treatment of the cell with regular insulin (1 µM) suppressed the GABA-induced current (I(GABA)) by 43%. Zinc-free insulin also suppressed I(GABA) to the same extent of inhibition by regular insulin. The inhibition of I(GABA) occurs within 30 seconds after application of insulin. The insulin-induced inhibition of I(GABA) persisted in the presence of PI3-kinase inhibitor, but was abolished upon inhibition of ERK, indicating that insulin suppresses GABA(A)Rs through a mechanism that involves ERK activation. Radioimmunoassay revealed that the secretion of C-peptide was enhanced by GABA, which was blocked by pre-incubating the cells with picrotoxin (50 µM, p<0.01) and insulin (1 µM, p<0.01), respectively. Together, these data suggest that autocrine GABA, via activation of GABA(A)Rs, depolarizes the pancreatic β-cells and enhances insulin secretion. On the other hand, insulin down-regulates GABA-GABA(A)R signaling presenting a feedback mechanism for fine-tuning β-cell secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1983375745,In flowering plants the gynoecium is the female reproductive structure. In Arabidopsis thaliana ovules initiate within the developing gynoecium from meristematic tissue located along the margins of the floral carpels. When fertilized the ovules will develop into seeds. SEUSS (SEU) and AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) encode transcriptional regulators that are critical for the proper formation of ovules from the carpel margin meristem (CMM). The synergistic loss of ovule initiation observed in the seu ant double mutant suggests that SEU and ANT share overlapping functions during CMM development. However the molecular mechanism underlying this synergistic interaction is unknown. Using the ATH1 transcriptomics platform we identified transcripts that were differentially expressed in seu ant double mutant relative to wild type and single mutant gynoecia. In particular we sought to identify transcripts whose expression was dependent on the coordinated activities of the SEU and ANT gene products. Our analysis identifies a diverse set of transcripts that display altered expression in the seu ant double mutant tissues. The analysis of overrepresented Gene Ontology classifications suggests a preponderance of transcriptional regulators including multiple members of the REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEMS (REM) and GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF) families are mis-regulated in the seu ant gynoecia. Our in situ hybridization analyses indicate that many of these genes are preferentially expressed within the developing CMM. This study is the first step toward a detailed description of the transcriptional regulatory hierarchies that control the development of the CMM and ovule initiation. Understanding the regulatory hierarchy controlled by SEU and ANT will clarify the molecular mechanism of the functional redundancy of these two genes and illuminate the developmental and molecular events required for CMM development and ovule initiation.
https://openalex.org/W1983376840,"The ADP-ribosyl cyclase CD38 whose catalytic domain resides in outside of the cell surface produces the second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD(+). cADPR increases intracellular Ca(2+) through the intracellular ryanodine receptor/Ca(2+) release channel (RyR). It has been known that intracellular NAD(+) approaches ecto-CD38 via its export by connexin (Cx43) hemichannels, a component of gap junctions. However, it is unclear how cADPR extracellularly generated by ecto-CD38 approaches intracellular RyR although CD38 itself or nucleoside transporter has been proposed to import cADPR. Moreover, it has been unknown what physiological stimulation can trigger Cx43-mediated export of NAD(+). Here we demonstrate that Cx43 hemichannels, but not CD38, import cADPR to increase intracellular calcium through RyR. We also demonstrate that physiological stimulation such as Fcγ receptor (FcγR) ligation induces calcium mobilization through three sequential steps, Cx43-mediated NAD(+) export, CD38-mediated generation of cADPR and Cx43-mediated cADPR import in J774 cells. Protein kinase A (PKA) activation also induced calcium mobilization in the same way as FcγR stimulation. FcγR stimulation-induced calcium mobilization was blocked by PKA inhibition, indicating that PKA is a linker between FcγR stimulation and NAD(+)/cADPR transport. Cx43 knockdown blocked extracellular cADPR import and extracellular cADPR-induced calcium mobilization in J774 cells. Cx43 overexpression in Cx43-negative cells conferred extracellular cADPR-induced calcium mobilization by the mediation of cADPR import. Our data suggest that Cx43 has a dual function exporting NAD(+) and importing cADPR into the cell to activate intracellular calcium mobilization."

In this study, we investigated the frequency of false positive results for the detection of carbapenemases in carbapenemase-negative Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates by the modified Hodge test (MHT). Three hundred and one E. coli and K. pneumoniae clinical isolates were investigated. All produced extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) but were susceptible to carbapenems. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion and agar dilution methods. The MHT was performed using the standard inoculum of test organisms recommended by the CLSI. Genes that encoded ESBLs and carbapenemases were identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. Among the 301 clinical isolates, none of the isolates conformed to the criteria for carbapenemase screening recommended by the CLSI. The susceptibility rates for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem all were 100.0%, 100.0%, and 100.0%, respectively. Of the 301 E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, none produced carbapenemase. The MHT gave a positive result for 3.3% (10/301) of the isolates. False positive results can occur when the MHT is used to detect carbapenemase in ESBL-producing isolates and clinical laboratories must be aware of this fact."
https://openalex.org/W2014704269,"The dengue non-structural 3 (NS3) is a multifunctional protein, containing a serino-protease domain, located at the N-terminal portion, and helicase, NTPase and RTPase domains present in the C-terminal region. This protein is considered the main target for CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses during dengue infection, which may be involved in protection. However, few studies have been undertaken evaluating the use of this protein as a protective antigen against dengue, as well as other flavivirus. In the present work, we investigate the protective efficacy of DNA vaccines based on the NS3 protein from DENV2. Different recombinant plasmids were constructed, encoding either the full-length NS3 protein or only its functional domains (protease and helicase), fused or not to a signal peptide (t-PA). The recombinant proteins were successfully expressed in transfected BHK-21 cells, and only plasmids encoding the t-PA signal sequence mediated protein secretion. Balb/c mice were immunized with the different DNA vaccines and challenged with a lethal dose of DENV2. Most animals immunized with plasmids encoding the full-length NS3 or the helicase domain survived challenge, regardless of the presence of the t-PA. However, some mice presented clinical signs of infection with high morbidity (hind leg paralysis and hunched posture), mainly in animal groups immunized with the DNA vaccines based on the helicase domain. On the other hand, inoculation with plasmids encoding the protease domain did not induce any protection, since mortality and morbidity rates in these mouse groups were similar to those detected in the control animals. The cellular immune response was analyzed by ELISPOT with a specific-CD8+ T cell NS3 peptide. Results revealed that the DNA vaccines based on the full-length protein induced the production of INF-γ, thus suggesting the involvement of this branch of the immune system in the protection."
https://openalex.org/W2079685157,"Chromatin remodelers are ATP-dependent machines that dynamically alter the chromatin packaging of eukaryotic genomes by assembling, sliding, and displacing nucleosomes. The Chd1 chromatin remodeler possesses a C-terminal DNA-binding domain that is required for efficient nucleosome sliding and believed to be essential for sensing the length of DNA flanking the nucleosome core. The structure of the Chd1 DNA-binding domain was recently shown to consist of a SANT and SLIDE domain, analogous to the DNA-binding domain of the ISWI family, yet the details of how Chd1 recognized DNA were not known. Here we present the crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Chd1 DNA-binding domain in complex with a DNA duplex. The bound DNA duplex is straight, consistent with the preference exhibited by the Chd1 DNA-binding domain for extranucleosomal DNA. Comparison of this structure with the recently solved ISW1a DNA-binding domain bound to DNA reveals that DNA lays across each protein at a distinct angle, yet contacts similar surfaces on the SANT and SLIDE domains. In contrast to the minor groove binding seen for Isw1 and predicted for Chd1, the SLIDE domain of the Chd1 DNA-binding domain contacts the DNA major groove. The majority of direct contacts with the phosphate backbone occur only on one DNA strand, suggesting that Chd1 may not strongly discriminate between major and minor grooves."

Escherichia coli SecA binds to cytoplasmic membranes at SecYEG high affinity sites and at phospholipid low affinity sites. It has been widely viewed that SecYEG functions as the essential protein-conducting channel through which precursors cross the membranes in bacterial Sec-dependent pathways, and that SecA functions as a motor to hydrolyze ATP in translocating precursors through SecYEG channels. We have now found that SecA alone can promote precursor translocation into phospholiposomes. Moreover, SecA-liposomes elicit ionic currents in Xenopus oocytes. Patch-clamp recordings further show that SecA alone promotes signal peptide- or precursor-dependent single channel activity. These activities were observed with the functional SecA at about 1–2 μm.

Even so, such SecA-liposomes are less efficient than those with a full complement of Sec proteins, and lose the signal-peptide proofreading function, resembling the effects of PrlA mutations.

https://openalex.org/W1986896032,"Background Pericentrin (Pcnt), a conserved protein of the pericentriolar material, serves as a multifunctional scaffold for numerous proteins and plays an important role in microtubule organization. Recent studies indicate that Pcnt mutations are associated with a range of diseases including primordial dwarfism and ciliopathies. To date, three Pcnt splice variants from orthologous genes in mice and humans are known. Principal Findings We generated a specific Pcnt antiserum detecting all known Pcnt splice variants and examined the cellular and subcellular distribution of Pcnt in ciliated tissues of the mouse, the olfactory epithelium and the retina. For the first time, we identified Pcnt and its centrosomal interaction partners at the basal body complex of mouse retinal photoreceptors. Photoreceptors are morphologically and functionally subdivided into the light sensitive outer segment and the inner segment comprising the metabolic function of the cell. The two compartments are linked via a modified, specialized, non-motile cilium, the connecting cilium. Here, Pcnt colocalized with the whole protein machinery responsible for transport processes between the two compartments. Surprisingly, photoreceptors expressed a small Pcnt splice transcript – most likely a modified variant of Pcnt S – which was not present in receptor neurons of the olfactory epithelium. Conclusions Our findings suggest distinct functional roles of several Pcnt variants in different ciliated tissues and sensory neurons, like the olfactory epithelium and the retina of the mouse. The individual patchwork of different Pcnt splice transcripts seems to reflect the complexity of Pcnt function, an assumption corroborated by the heterogeneous clinical manifestations associated with mutations in the Pcnt gene."
https://openalex.org/W2084227241,"High-protein diets are effective in achieving weight loss which is mainly explained by increased satiety and thermogenic effects. Recent studies suggest that the effects of protein-rich diets on satiety could be mediated by amino acids like leucine or arginine. Although high-protein diets require increased intestinal amino acid absorption, amino acid and peptide absorption has not yet been considered to contribute to satiety effects. We here demonstrate a novel finding that links intestinal peptide transport processes to food intake, but only when a protein-rich diet is provided. When mice lacking the intestinal peptide transporter PEPT1 were fed diets containing 8 or 21 energy% of protein, no differences in food intake and weight gain were observed. However, upon feeding a high-protein (45 energy%) diet, Pept1(-/-) mice reduced food intake much more pronounced than control animals. Although there was a regain in food consumption after a few days, no weight gain was observed which was associated with a reduced intestinal energy assimilation and increased fecal energy losses. Pept1(-/-) mice on high-protein diet displayed markedly reduced plasma leptin levels during the period of very low food intake, suggesting a failure of leptin signaling to increase energy intake. This together with an almost two-fold elevated plasma arginine level in Pept1(-/-) but not wildtype mice, suggests that a cross-talk of arginine with leptin signaling in brain, as described previously, could cause these striking effects on food intake."
https://openalex.org/W2143879590,"To explore the structural mechanisms underlying the assembly and activation of family A GPCR dimers, we used the rat M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R) as a model system. Studies with Cys-substituted mutant M3Rs expressed in COS-7 cells led to the identification of several mutant M3Rs that exclusively existed as cross-linked dimers under oxidizing conditions. The cross-linked residues were located at the bottom of transmembrane domain 5 (TM5) and within the N-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop (i3 loop). Studies with urea-stripped membranes demonstrated that M3R disulfide cross-linking did not require the presence of heterotrimeric G proteins. Molecular modeling studies indicated that the cross-linking data were in excellent agreement with the existence of a low-energy M3R dimer characterized by a TM5-TM5 interface. [35S]GTPγS binding/Gαq/11 immunoprecipitation assays revealed that an M3R dimer that was cross-linked within the N-terminal portion of the i3 loop (264C) was functionally severely impaired (∼50% reduction in receptor-G-protein coupling, as compared to control M3R). These data support the novel concept that agonist-induced activation of M3R dimers requires a conformational change of the N-terminal segment of the i3 loop. Given the high degree of structural homology among family A GPCRs, these findings should be of broad significance.—Hu, J., Thor, D., Zhou, Y., Liu, T., Wang, Y., McMillin, S.

https://openalex.org/W2157522406,"The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is a tumor suppressor that has an important role in several cellular processes, including apoptosis, viral infection, DNA damage repair, cell cycle regulation, and senescence. PML is an essential component of sub-nuclear structures called PML nuclear bodies (NBs). Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, Pin1, binds and targets PML for degradation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying Pin1-mediated PML degradation, we aimed to identify one or more factors that promote PML phosphorylation. Here we show that treatment with U0126, an inhibitor of the ERK2 upstream kinases MEK1/2, leads to an increase in PML protein accumulation and an inhibition of the interaction between Pin1 and PML in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Consistent with this observation, phosphorylated ERK2 partially co-localized with PML NBs. Although U0126 up-regulated exogenous wild-type PML levels, it did not have an effect on the steady-state level of a mutant form of PML that is defective in binding Pin1. In addition, exogenous wild-type, but not Pin1 binding-defective PML protein expression levels were decreased by overexpression of ERK2. In contrast, knockdown of ERK2 by siRNA resulted in an increase in PML protein levels and an increase in the formation of PML NBs. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we identified Ser-403 and Ser-505 as the ERK2 targets that promote Pin1-mediated PML degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that EGF induced activation of ERK and interaction between PML and phosphorylated ERK resulting in a decrease in PML protein levels. Taken together, our results support a model in which Pin1 promotes PML degradation in an ERK2-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2004293344,"Since the discovery of RNAi and microRNAs more than 10 years ago, much research has focused on the development of systems that usurp microRNA pathways to downregulate gene expression in mammalian cells. One of these systems makes use of endogenous microRNA pri-cursors that are expressed from polymerase II promoters where the mature microRNA sequence is replaced by gene specific duplexes that guide RNAi (shRNA-miRs). Although shRNA-miRs are effective in directing target mRNA knockdown and hence reducing protein expression in many cell types, variability of RNAi efficacy in cell lines has been an issue. Here we show that the choice of the polymerase II promoter used to drive shRNA expression is of critical importance to allow effective mRNA target knockdown. We tested the abundance of shRNA-miRs expressed from five different polymerase II promoters in 6 human cell lines and measured their ability to drive target knockdown. We observed a clear positive correlation between promoter strength, siRNA expression levels, and protein target knockdown. Differences in RNAi from the shRNA-miRs expressed from the various promoters were particularly pronounced in immune cells. Our findings have direct implications for the design of shRNA-directed RNAi experiments and the preferred RNAi system to use for each cell type."

Despite this, little is known about the characteristics of older adults who are on treatment and their treatment outcomes.A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using routinely collected data with Malawi Ministry of Health monitoring tools from facilities providing antiretroviral therapy services in Zomba district. Patients aged 25 years and older initiated on treatment from July 2005 to June 2010 were included. Differences in survival, by age group, were determined using Kaplan-Meier survival plots and Cox proportional hazards regression models.There were 10,888 patients aged 25 and older. Patients aged 50 and older (N = 1419) were more likely to be male (P<0.0001) and located in rural areas (P = 0.003) than those aged 25-49. Crude survival estimates among those aged 50-59 were not statistically different from those aged 25-49 (P = 0.925). However, survival among those aged 60 and older (N = 345) was worse (P = 0.019) than among those 25-59. In the proportional hazards model, after controlling for sex and stage at initiation, survival in those aged 50-59 did not differ significantly from those aged 25-49 (hazard ratio 1.00 (95% CI: 0.79 to 1.27; P = 0.998) but the hazard ratio was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.03 to 2.06; P = 0.032) for those aged 60 and older compared to those aged 25-49.Treatment outcomes of those aged 50-59 are similar to those aged 25-49. A better understanding of how older adults present for and respond to treatment is critical to improving HIV services."
https://openalex.org/W1973457369,"Background Although cervico-vaginal epithelial cells of the female lower genital tract provide the initial defense system against HIV-1 infection, the protection is sometimes incomplete. Thus, enhancing anti-HIV-1 humoral immunity at the mucosal cell surface by local expression of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (BnAb) that block HIV-1 entry would provide an important new intervention that could slow the spread of HIV/AIDS. Methods and Findings This study tested the hypothesis that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-BnAb gene transfer to cervico-vaginal epithelial cells will lead to protection against HIV-1. Accordingly, a recombinant AAV vector that encodes human b12 anti-HIV gp120 BnAb as a single-chain variable fragment Fc fusion (scFvFc), or “minibody” was constructed. The secreted b12 minibody was shown to be biologically functional in binding to virus envelope protein, neutralizing HIV-1 and importantly, blocking transfer and infectivity of HIV-1bal in an organotypic human vaginal epithelial cell (VEC) model. Furthermore, cervico-vaginal epithelial stem cells were found to be efficiently transduced by the optimal AAV serotype mediated expression of GFP. Conclusion This study provides the foundation for a novel microbicide strategy to protect against sexual transmission of HIV-1 by AAV transfer of broadly neutralizing antibody genes to cervico-vaginal epithelial stem cells that could replenish b12 BnAb secreting cells through multiple menstrual cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2032919519,"Introduction Human cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) has been hypothesized to be an age-dependent disease accompanied by similar vascular changes in other organs. SHRSP feature numerous vascular risk factors and may be a valid model of some aspects of human CSVD. Here we compare renal histopathological changes with the brain pathology of spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP). Material and Methods We histologically investigated the brains and kidneys of 61 SHRSP at different stages of age (12 to 44 weeks). The brain pathology (aggregated erythrocytes in capillaries and arterioles, microbleeds, microthromboses) and the kidney pathology (aggregated erythrocytes within peritubular capillaries, tubular protein cylinders, glomerulosclerosis) were quantified separately. The prediction of the brain pathology by the kidney pathology was assessed by creating ROC-curves integrating the degree of kidney pathology and age of SHRSP. Results Both, brain and kidney pathology, show an age-dependency and proceed in definite stages whereas an aggregation of erythrocytes in capillaries and arterioles, we parsimoniously interpreted as stases, represent the initial finding in both organs. Thus, early renal tubulointerstitial damage characterized by rather few intravasal erythrocyte aggregations and tubular protein cylinders predicts the initial step of SHRSPs' cerebral vascular pathology marked by accumulated erythrocytes. The combined increase of intravasal erythrocyte aggregations and protein cylinders accompanied by glomerulosclerosis and thrombotic renal microangiopathy in kidneys of older SHRSP predicts the final stages of SHRSPs' cerebrovascular lesions marked by microbleeds and thrombotic infarcts. Conclusion Our results illustrate a close association between structural brain and kidney pathology and support the concept of small vessel disease to be an age-dependent systemic pathology. Further, an improved joined nephrologic and neurologic diagnostic may help to identify patients with CSVD at an early stage."
https://openalex.org/W2016347466,"Renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI) is a common and important trigger of acute renal injury (AKI). It is inevitably linked to transplantation. Involving both, the innate and the adaptive immune response, IRI causes subsequent sterile inflammation. Attraction to and transmigration of immune cells into the interstitium is associated with increased vascular permeability and loss of endothelial and tubular epithelial cell integrity. Considering the important role of cytoskeletal reorganization, mainly regulated by RhoGTPases, in the development of IRI we hypothesized that a preventive, selective inhibition of the Rho effector Rho-associated coiled coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) by hydroxyfasudil may improve renal IRI outcome. Using an IRI-based animal model of AKI in male Sprague Dawley rats, animals treated with hydroxyfasudil showed reduced proteinuria and polyuria as well as increased urine osmolarity when compared with sham-treated animals. In addition, renal perfusion (as assessed by (18)F-fluoride Positron Emission Tomography (PET)), creatinine- and urea-clearances improved significantly. Moreover, endothelial leakage and renal inflammation was significantly reduced as determined by histology, (18)F-fluordesoxyglucose-microautoradiography, Evans Blue, and real-time PCR analysis. We conclude from our study that ROCK-inhibition by hydroxyfasudil significantly improves kidney function in a rat model of acute renal IRI and is therefore a potential new therapeutic option in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2054584829,"Background Cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) agonists attenuate inflammatory pain but the precise mechanism implicated in these effects is not completely elucidated. We investigated if the peripheral nitric oxide-cGMP-protein kinase G (PKG)-ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels signaling pathway triggered by the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) and modulated by opioids, participates in the local antinociceptive effects produced by a CB2R agonist (JWH-015) during chronic inflammatory pain. Methodology/Principal Findings In wild type (WT) and NOS1 knockout (NOS1-KO) mice, at 10 days after the subplantar administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), we evaluated the antiallodynic (von Frey filaments) and antihyperalgesic (plantar test) effects produced by the subplantar administration of JWH-015 and the reversion of their effects by the local co-administration with CB2R (AM630), peripheral opioid receptor (naloxone methiodide, NX-ME) or CB1R (AM251) antagonists. Expression of CB2R and NOS1 as well as the antinociceptive effects produced by a high dose of JWH-015 combined with different doses of selective L-guanylate cyclase (ODQ) or PKG (Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs) inhibitors or a KATP channel blocker (glibenclamide), were also assessed. Results show that the local administration of JWH-015 dose-dependently inhibited the mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity induced by CFA which effects were completely reversed by the local co-administration of AM630 or NX-ME, but not AM251. Inflammatory pain increased the paw expression of CB2R and the dorsal root ganglia transcription of NOS1. Moreover, the antinociceptive effects of JWH-015 were absent in NOS1-KO mice and diminished by their co-administration with ODQ, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs or glibenclamide. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that the peripheral antinociceptive effects of JWH-015 during chronic inflammatory pain are mainly produced by the local activation of the nitric oxide-cGMP-PKG-KATP signaling pathway, triggered by NOS1 and mediated by endogenous opioids. These findings suggest that the activation of this pathway might be an interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain with cannabinoids."
https://openalex.org/W2171095823,"Objective To investigate the factors associated with clinical progression and good prognosis in patients with lower limb osteoarthritis (OA). Methods Cohort study of 145 patients with OA in either knee, hip or both. Progression was defined as 1) new joint prosthesis or 2) increase in WOMAC pain or function score during 6-years follow-up above pre-defined thresholds. Patients without progression with decrease in WOMAC pain or function score lower than pre-defined thresholds were categorized as good prognosis. Relative risks (RRs) for progression and good prognosis with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated by comparing the highest tertile or category to the lowest tertile, for baseline determinants (age, sex, BMI, WOMAC pain and function scores, pain on physical examination, total range of motion (tROM), osteophytes and joint space narrowing (JSN) scores), and for worsening in WOMAC pain and function score in 1-year. Adjustments were performed for age, sex, and BMI. Results Follow-up was completed by 117 patients (81%, median age 60 years, 84% female); 62 (53%) and 31 patients (26%) showed progression and good prognosis, respectively. These following determinants were associated with progression: pain on physical examination (RR 1.2 (1.0 to 1.5)); tROM (1.4 (1.1 to 1.6); worsening in WOMAC pain (1.9 (1.2 to 2.3)); worsening in WOMAC function (2.4 (1.7 to 2.6)); osteophytes 1.5 (1.0 to 1.8); and JSN scores (2.3 (1.5 to 2.7)). Worsening in WOMAC pain (0.1 (0.1 to 0.8)) and function score (0.1 (0.1 to 0.7)), were negatively associated with good prognosis. Conclusion Worsening of self-reported pain and function in one year, limited tROM and higher osteophytes and JSN scores were associated with clinical progression. Worsening in WOMAC pain and function score in 1- year were associated with lower risk to have good prognosis. These findings help to inform patients with regard to their OA prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W1990257304,"Background During inflammation, adhesion molecules regulate recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissues. It is reported that vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) activates extracellular regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), but the mechanism for this activation is not known. Pharmacological inhibitors of ERK1/2 partially inhibit leukocyte transendothelial migration in a multi-receptor system but it is not known whether VCAM-1 activation of ERK1/2 is required for leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM) on VCAM-1. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we identified a mechanism for VCAM-1 activation of ERK1/2 in human and mouse endothelial cells. VCAM-1 signaling, which occurs through endothelial cell NADPH oxidase, protein kinase Cα (PKCα), and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), activates endothelial cell ERK1/2. Inhibition of these signals blocked VCAM-1 activation of ERK1/2, indicating that ERK1/2 is activated downstream of PTP1B during VCAM-1 signaling. Furthermore, VCAM-1-specific leukocyte migration under physiological laminar flow of 2 dynes/cm2 was blocked by pretreatment of endothelial cells with dominant-negative ERK2 K52R or the MEK/ERK inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, indicating for the first time that ERK regulates VCAM-1-dependent leukocyte transendothelial migration. Conclusions/Significance VCAM-1 activation of endothelial cell NADPH oxidase/PKCα/PTP1B induces transient ERK1/2 activation that is necessary for VCAM-1-dependent leukocyte TEM."

However, it is unknown whether the synchrony results from muscle electrical coupling or neural inputs. We analyzed the effects of mutating gap junction proteins and blocking neuromuscular transmission on the synchrony of action potentials (APs) and Ca2+ transients among neighboring body wall muscle cells. In wild-type worms, the percentage of synchronous APs between two neighboring cells varied depending on the anatomical relationship and junctional conductance (Gj) between them, and Ca2+ transients were synchronous among neighboring muscle cells. Compared with the wild type, knock-out of the gap junction gene unc-9 resulted in greatly reduced coupling coefficient and asynchronous APs and Ca2+ transients. Inhibition of unc-9 expression specifically in muscle by RNAi also reduced the synchrony of APs and Ca2+ transients, whereas expression of wild-type UNC-9 specifically in muscle rescued the synchrony defect. Loss of the stomatin-like protein UNC-1, which is a regulator of UNC-9-based gap junctions, similarly impaired muscle synchrony as unc-9 mutant did.

The mechanism for generating this locomotion wave is a subject of great interest because, with a locomotory system consisting mainly of five pairs of command interneurons, 57 ventral cord motoneurons, and 95 body wall muscle cells (1Goodman M.B.

The sinusoidal locomotion of the worm requires synchronized contractions and relaxations of neighboring body wall muscle cells at the same position along the longitudinal body axis. It is unclear how the muscle cells get synchronized. Neural control could be important because each motoneuron forms synapses with several muscle cells that are located at the same longitudinal level (5Liu Q. Chen B. Hall D.H. Wang Z.W. Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 6White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, gap junctions could play a role because muscle cells in parallel are electrically coupled, whereas those in series are not (7Liu Q. Chen B. Gaier E. Joshi J. Wang Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7881-7889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, precise roles of neural inputs and muscle gap junctions in synchronizing muscle activities are poorly defined. Mutations of body wall muscle acetylcholine or GABA receptors cause severe locomotion defects (8Lewis J.A. Wu C.H. Berg H. Levine J.H.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5348-5359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether the locomotory defects simply result from a change in muscle contractility or are also contributed by asynchrony. Injection of a small current comparable with that of the junctional currents (Ij) into a muscle cell causes significant membrane depolarization of the cell (7Liu Q. Chen B. Gaier E. Joshi J. Wang Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7881-7889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, mathematical modeling has led to controversial conclusions. Although one study suggested that body wall muscle electrical coupling is required for propagating the undulatory locomotion wave (13Karbowski J. Schindelman G. Cronin C.J. Seah A. Sternberg P.W. J. Comput. Neurosci. 2008; 24: 253-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), another study concluded that the Ij between body wall muscle cells is too small to be of physiological significance (14Boyle J.H. Cohen N. Biosystems. 2008; 94: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, further studies are needed to assess the roles of neuromuscular transmission and gap junctions in synchronizing muscle activities. Gap junctions have been implicated in the synchrony of a variety of cells. For example, neighboring body wall muscle cells of Ascaris lumbricoides, which is phylogenetically related to C. elegans, are electrically coupled (15Debell J.T. Delcastillo J. Sanchez V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1963; 62: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and fire action potentials (APs) 2The abbreviations used are: APaction potentialIPSCinhibitory postsynaptic currentminisspontaneous postsynaptic currentsPmyo-3promoter of the myosin heavy chain gene myo-3TBC(+)-tubocurarineANOVAanalysis of variance. synchronously (16Weisblat D.A. Russell R.L. J. Comp. Physiol. 1976; 107: 293-307Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The synchrony of APs was thought to result from electrical coupling of the muscle cells (16Weisblat D.A. Russell R.L. J. Comp. Physiol. 1976; 107: 293-307Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but no experimental evidence exists to back up this assumption. In mammalian brain, network oscillations, which are important to cognition (17Buzsáki G. Draguhn A. Science. 2004; 304: 1926-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (4216) Google Scholar), depend on synchronous electrical activities of inhibitory interneurons, and the synchrony requires the function of gap junctions but could be driven by chemical synaptic transmission (18Zhang Y.

Gap junctions in C. elegans are formed by innexins (26Phelan P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 225-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The innexin UNC-9 is a major component of gap junctions in C. elegans body wall muscle cells (7Liu Q. Chen B. Gaier E. Joshi J. Wang Z.W. J. Biol.

Wang Z.W. J. Physiol. 2011; 589: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether APs and Ca2+ transients are synchronized in neighboring body wall muscle cells and whether gap junctions are important to the synchrony. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of muscle gap junction deficiency and neuromuscular transmission blockade on the synchrony of C. elegans body wall muscle cells. We found that muscle gap junctions played a central role in synchronizing muscle APs and Ca2+ transients. This information is potentially useful to improving the existing models regarding C. elegans locomotion (1Goodman M.B.

C. elegans hermaphrodites were grown on agar plates with a layer of OP50 Escherichia coli either at room temperature (21–22 °C) or inside an environmental chamber (21 °C). Adult hermaphrodite animals were immobilized and dissected as described previously (33Wang Z.W. Saifee O. Nonet M.L. Salkoff L. Neuron. 2001; 32: 867-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 34Richmond J.E. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Briefly, an animal was immobilized on a glass coverslip by applying VetbondTM tissue adhesive (3M Company). Application of the adhesive was generally restricted to the dorsal middle portion of the animal, allowing the head and tail to sway during the experiment. A longitudinal incision was made in the dorsolateral region. After clearing the viscera, the cuticle flap was folded back and glued to the coverslip, exposing the ventral nerve cord and the two adjacent muscle quadrants. A Nikon FN-1 microscope equipped with a 40× water immersion objective and 15× eyepieces was used for viewing the preparation. Borosilicate glass pipettes with a tip resistance of 3–5 MΩ were used as electrodes for current- and voltage clamp recordings in the classical whole cell patch clamp configuration with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and the Clampex software (version 10, Molecular Devices). Series resistance was compensated to 75–80% in voltage clamp experiments. The data were sampled at a rate of 10 kHz after filtering at 2 kHz. Spontaneous APs were recorded simultaneously from specific pairs of neighboring body wall muscle cells without current injection. For recording Ij, the membrane voltage (Vm) of both cells was held at −30 mV, from which a series of voltage steps (−110 to +50 mV at 10-mV intervals and 250-ms duration) were applied to one cell (Cell 1), whereas the other cell (Cell 2) was held constant to record Ij. Junctional voltage (Vj) was defined as Vm of Cell 2 minus Vm of Cell 1. Negative currents of 1-s duration and various amplitudes (10, 20, and 30 pA) were injected into one cell, whereas the membrane voltage changes in response to the current injections were recorded from both the injected cell and a neighboring muscle cell. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents (referred to as “minis”) were recorded from wild-type worms, whereas evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were recorded from an integrated transgenic strain expressing mCherry-tagged channel rhodopsin-2 in GABAergic neurons under the control of unc-47 (vesicular GABA transporter) promoter (35Liu Q. Hollopeter G. Jorgensen E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10823-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) at a holding potential of −10 mV. IPSCs were evoked by applying a pulse (3 ms) of blue light using a 470 ± 20-nm excitation filter (filter 59222; Chroma Technology Corp.) and a light source equipped with a shutter (Lambda XL with SmartShutter; Sutter Instrument) (36Chen B. Liu P. Wang S.J. Ge Q. Zhan H. Mohler W.A. Wang Z.W. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3184-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The standard extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 11 mm dextrose, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The standard pipette solution contained 120 mm KCl, 20 mm KOH, 5 mm Tris, 0.25 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 36 mm sucrose, 5 mm EGTA, and 4 mm Na2ATP (pH 7.2). In the experiments analyzing the effects of gabazine on minis and IPSCs, the standard pipette solution was modified by substituting 113.2 mm KCl with equal molar potassium gluconate. In the experiments analyzing the effects of TBC and gabazine on APs, the extracellular solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dextrose, 5 mm sucrose, and 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and the pipette solution contained 25 mm KCl, 115 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm K4BAPTA, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mm Na2GTP, 0.5 mm cAMP, and 0.5 mm cGMP (pH 7.2). The compositions of these two solutions were partially based on those used in a previous study (29Gao S. Zhen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2557-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TBC (T2397; Sigma-Aldrich) and gabazine (S106; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in the extracellular solution to make frozen stocks and added to the recording chamber by pipetting after diluting with the extracellular solution. An integrated Pmyo-3::GCaMP2 transgene (28Liu P. Ge Q. Chen B. Salkoff L. Kotlikoff M.I. Wang Z.W. J. Physiol. 2011; 589: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was crossed into different mutant backgrounds. The worms were glued and filleted to image spontaneous fluorescence changes of GCaMP2 in body wall muscle cells using an electron-multiplying CCD camera (iXonEM+885; Andor Technology, Belfast, Northern Ireland), a FITC filter (59222; Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT), a light source (Lambda XL; Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA), and the NIS-Elements software (Nikon). The images were acquired at 16 frames/s with 10–40 ms of exposure time (no binning) for 4 or 5 min. The bath solution used in these experiments was the standard extracellular solution. Based on an established method (37Esposito G. Di Schiavi E. Bergamasco C. Bazzicalupo P. Gene. 2007; 395: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a portion (1–397 bp) of the unc-9 cDNA (R12H7.1, www.wormbase.org) was cloned into a worm expression vector containing the muscle-specific myo-3 promoter (pPD118.20) in both the sense and antisense directions to generate two separate worm expression plasmids: Pmyo-3::unc-9(1–397 sense) (wp872) and Pmyo-3::unc-9(1–397 antisense) (wp873). The two plasmids were coinjected into the wild type together with a Pmyo-2::DsRED plasmid (wp568), which served as a transformation marker, to generate a transgenic strain for analyzing the effects of unc-9 RNAi on APs, Gj, and Ca2+ transients. The transgene was also crossed into a wild-type strain expressing Pmyo-3::UNC-9::GFP (27Chen B. Liu Q. Ge Q. Xie J. Wang Z.W. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1334-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to verify the effectiveness of RNAi. To rescue unc-9 defect specifically in muscle, a plasmid (wp223) with wild-type unc-9 cDNA downstream of the myo-3 myosin heavy chain promoter (Pmyo-3) (38Okkema P.G. Harrison S.W. Plunger V. Aryana A. Fire A. Genetics. 1993; 135: 385-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was expressed in unc-9(fc16) mutant following standard transgenic procedures (39Evans T. Transformation and Microinjection, WormBook, The C. elegans Research Community.doi/10.1895/wormbookDate: 2006http://www.wormbook.orgGoogle Scholar). A plasmid containing Pmyo-3 and GFP cDNA (pPD118.20) was coinjected to serve as a transformation marker. Muscle cells showing GFP fluorescence were used for electrophysiological analyses. To determine the effect of muscle UNC-9 on Ca2+ transients, wp223 was injected into unc-9(fc16) mutant expressing the integrated Pmyo-3::GCaMP2 transgene, together with wp568 to serve as a transgenic marker. The peak times of the cell with a lower AP frequency were subtracted from those of the cell with a higher AP frequency. Two consecutive APs (one from each cell) with the shortest interpeak interval were assigned as a pair and used to calculate the peak time difference. APs that could not be assigned into pairs (because of the absence of events in the other cell) were excluded from the analysis. The averaged Ij traces from four runs of voltage steps were used for statistical analyses after filtering at 300 Hz. The apparent mean steady-state current during the last 100 ms of the voltage steps was determined with Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and used to plot the Ij-Vj relationship. Gj was determined from the slope of the Ij-Vj relationship at the liner portion (Vj = −30 to +30 mV) and compared among the different groups. Ij traces are displayed at 20-mV Vj intervals in figures for clarity, although the data were acquired and analyzed at 10-mV Vj intervals. The mean membrane voltage between 300 and 800 ms of each current injection step was quantified with Clampfit. The coupling coefficient was the ratio of the mean membrane voltage change of the uninjected cell over that of the injected cell at each current injection step. To determine whether Ca2+ transients were synchronous among neighboring cells, all of the muscle cells with Ca2+ transients within the camera imaging field (typically around 10 cells) were assigned as separate regions of interest. The fluorescence intensities in the regions of interest over successive frames were first plotted as absolute fluorescence intensity over time using the NIS-Elements software and then converted to F/F0 using the MATLAB software (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) running a custom module. The Ca2+ transient traces (F/F0 over time) of all the cells within the camera imaging field were visually inspected to determine whether or not the events were synchronous. Cells without Ca2+ transients (e.g. some cells in unc-9 and/or unc-1 mutants) were excluded from analysis. The frequency, amplitude, and area of Ca2+ transients were first determined separately for all the cells with Ca2+ transients within the camera imaging field and then averaged. The frequency of mPSCs was determined using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA) from an uninterrupted trace of 15 s before and 15 s after the application of gabazine. A detection threshold of 10 pA was used in initial automatic analysis, followed by visual inspections to include missed events (≥5 pA) and to exclude false events resulting from baseline fluctuations. The peak amplitudes of IPSCs were measured with Clampfit. Three consecutive IPSCs immediately before gabazine and three immediately after the application of gabazine were averaged separately. Data graphing and statistical analyses were performed with OriginPro (version 8.5; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA). Either paired t test or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test, as specified in the figure legends, were used for comparing the means. The data are shown as the means ± S.E. p < 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant. The sample size (n) is equal to the number of cell pairs (for APs, Ij and the coupling coefficient), cells (for minis and IPSCs), or worm preparations (for Ca2+ transients). We first determined whether APs were synchronous in neighboring muscle cells and whether AP synchrony was related to Gj by performing current and voltage clamp experiments for various pairs of contacting muscle cells. The analyzed pairs of contacting muscle cells included L1L2, R1R2, L1R1, L1R2, R1L2, L2R2, L1L1, and R1R1 (Fig. 1A). Among them, data from six pairs were pooled into three groups: L1L2+R1R2, L1R2+R1L2, and L1L1+R1R1, because the two pairs within each pooled group have analogous anatomical locations and are indistinguishable in functional properties. Sample traces of APs and Ij from the different cell pairs are shown in Fig. 1B. Two APs were considered to be synchronous if the time difference between their peaks was ≤50 ms. This criterion was used because the majority of the events were within ± 50 ms when the AP peak times of one cell are subtracted from those of the other cell in the L1L2 and R1R2 pairs (Fig. 1C), which had the highest Gj, and because the probability for the peak time difference to occur within ± 50 ms by random chance was reasonably low, ∼17% ((2 × 50)/600 = 16.7%) based on the mean interspike interval of 600 ms in wild-type worms (28Liu P. Ge Q. Chen B. Salkoff L. Kotlikoff M.I. Wang Z.W. J. Physiol. 2011; 589: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The percentage of synchronized APs varied among the different pairs of muscle cells with the mean value being 75% in L1L2 and R1R2, 55% in L1R1, 44% in L1R2 and R1L2, 23% in L2-R2, and 13% in L1L1 and R1R1 (Fig. 1D). The value for the L1L1 and R1R1 pairs was close to that estimated for pure chance (17%), which is consistent with the fact that Gj was very low in this pair of cells. A larger percentage of synchronous APs generally corresponded to a higher Gj (Fig. 1D). Subsequent analyses of AP synchronization and Gj were performed only with the L1L2 and R1R2 pairs because their higher Gj and AP synchrony made the analyses more reliable. We also calculated the mean peak time difference for synchronous APs. The difference was ∼20 ms in all except for the L1L1 and R1R1 pairs, which showed a significantly larger peak time difference (Fig. 1E). It is not immediately obvious what underlay the larger time difference in this pair. In C. elegans body wall muscle cells, electrical coupling is mainly mediated by gap junctions formed by the innexin UNC-9 (7Liu Q. Chen B. Gaier E. Joshi J. Wang Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7881-7889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To further assess the role of electrical coupling in AP synchronization, we compared the percentage of synchronous APs and the level of Gj in the L1L2 and R1R2 pairs between the wild type and a putative unc-9 null mutant, unc-9(fc16) (40Barnes T.M. Hekimi S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2251-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The proportion of synchronous APs was 60% lower in the mutant, which was accompanied by a decrease of the mean Gj to a comparable degree (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the mean peak time difference for synchronous APs remained unchanged in the mutant (Fig. 2C). These observations suggest that gap junctions formed by UNC-9 play important roles in synchronizing muscle APs. We previously reported that the function of UNC-9-based gap junctions depends on the stomatin-like protein UNC-1 (27Chen B. Liu Q. Ge Q. Xie J. Wang Z.W. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1334-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To test whether UNC-1 also plays a role in synchronizing muscle APs, we analyzed APs and Ij in the putative null mutant unc-1(e719) (41Rajaram S. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the double mutant unc-9(fc16);unc-1(e719). We found that both the unc-1 single mutant and the unc-9;unc-1 double mutant similarly affected muscle APs and Gj, as did unc-9 mutant (Fig. 2, A and B), which further supports that UNC-9 gap junctions are important to muscle synchrony. We also tested the effects of carbenoxolone (50 μm) and probenecid (100 μm) on Gj of the L1L2 and R1R2 pairs in wild-type worms. Carbenoxolone is a nonspecific gap junction blocker (42Davidson J.S. Baumgarten I.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 1104-1107PubMed Google Scholar), whereas probenecid blocks channels formed by pannexin 1 (43Silverman W. Locovei S. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C761-C767Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), which is a homologue of invertebrate innexins. However, neither chemical showed an inhibitory effect on the Gj (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, they were not used for assessing the role of gap junctions in muscle synchrony. The correlation between synchronous AP and Gj in wild-type and mutant worms suggests that changes in the membrane potential of one cell may alter that of the neighboring cells through gap junctions. To confirm this prediction, we determined the coupling coefficient between two contacting cells of the L1L2 and R1R2 pairs in the wild type, unc-9(fc16), unc-1(e719), and the double mutant unc-9(fc16);unc-1(e719). Currents were injected into one cell of the pair (−10 to −30 pA at 10-pA intervals, 1-s duration), whereas membrane voltage changes were monitored in both cells. The coupling coefficient was the ratio of membrane voltage change of the noninjected cell over that of the injected cell. Positive current pulses were not used to avoid complications by APs. In response to current injections, the injected cell (Cell 1) showed similar voltage changes in wild-type and mutant worms, whereas the uninjected cell (Cell 2) showed significantly larger voltage change in the wild type than any of the mutants, among which there was no difference (Fig. 3, A and B). The coupling coefficient was 0.25 in wild-type worms but ∼0.1 in the various mutants (Fig. 3C). Thus, membrane voltage change of one muscle cell may affect that of the neighboring cells through gap junctions; and both UNC-9 and UNC-1 are important in allowing this to occur. UNC-9 is expressed in muscle cells as well as many neurons, including command interneurons and ventral cord motoneurons (44Altun Z.F. Chen B. Wang Z.W. Hall D.H. Dev. Dyn. 2009; 238: 1936-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, UNC-9 deficiency in neurons might indirectly contribute to the changes of APs and Ca2+ transients observed in the unc-9 mutant. To assess the pure effect of muscle UNC-9 deficiency, we created transgenic worms in which unc-9 expression in muscle was selectively inhibited by RNAi. Furthermore, we performed muscle-specific rescue experiments by expressing wild-type UNC-9 in body wall muscle cells under the control of Pmyo-3. The RNAi was effective as indicated by the disappearance of fluorescent puncta at muscle intercellular junctions in a transgenic strain expressing an UNC-9::GFP fusion protein (Fig. 4A). Worms expressing the RNAi transgenes showed decreased Gj and AP synchrony in the L1L2 and R1R2 pairs compared with wild type, but th"

Although crystal structures of insulin dimers and hexamers are well established, proinsulin is refractory to crystallization. Although an NMR structure of an engineered proinsulin monomer has been reported, structures of the wild-type monomer and hexamer remain undetermined. We have utilized hydroxyl radical footprinting and molecular modeling to characterize these structures. Differences between the footprints of insulin and proinsulin, defining a ""shadow"" of the connecting (C) domain, were employed to refine the model. Our results demonstrate that in its monomeric form, (i) proinsulin contains a native-like insulin moiety and (ii) the C-domain footprint resides within an adjoining segment (residues B23-B29) that is accessible to modification in insulin but not proinsulin. Corresponding oxidation rates were observed within core insulin moieties of insulin and proinsulin hexamers, suggesting that the proinsulin hexamer retains an A/B structure similar to that of insulin. Further similarities in rates of oxidation between the respective C-domains of proinsulin monomers and hexamers suggest that this loop in each case flexibly projects from an outer surface. Although dimerization or hexamer assembly would not be impaired, an ensemble of predicted C-domain positions would block hexamer-hexamer stacking as visualized in classical crystal lattices. We anticipate that protein footprinting in combination with modeling, as illustrated here, will enable comparative studies of diabetes-associated mutant proinsulins and their aberrant modes of aggregation."

To study its conformational dynamics, the plug was labeled site-specifically with an environment-sensitive fluorophore. In the presence of a stable preprotein translocation inter-mediate, the SecY plug showed an enhanced solvent exposure consistent with a displacement from the hydrophobic central pore region. In contrast, binding and insertion of a ribosome-bound nascent membrane protein did not alter the plug conformation. These data indicate different plug dynamics depending on the ligand bound state of the SecYEG channel."
https://openalex.org/W2094990470,"Recently, we have described that apoptosis-like process of red blood cells (RBC) - eryptosis - in malaria is not restricted to parasitized cells, occurring also in non-parasitized RBC (nRBC). Besides to pathogenic proprieties, apoptosis also participates in the innate defense trough restriction of intracellular pathogens propagation. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of P. falciparum parasites to infect eryptotic RBC. Schizont parasitized RBC concentrated by magnetic separation were cultured with eryptotic RBC obtained by ionomycin treatment and, then, parasite growth was evaluated in Giemsa-stained thin blood smears. While parasites infected and developed normally in control non-eryptotic RBC, cultures performed with eryptotic RBC had a marked decrease in parasitaemia. It was noteworthy a great number of free merozoites in eryptotic RBC cultures, indicating that these cells were not susceptible to invasion. We suggest that although eryptosis could be involved in malaria pathogenesis, it could also acting protectively by controlling parasite propagation."
https://openalex.org/W2016956855,"The human microbiota has come into focus in the search for component causes of chronic diseases, such as gastrointestinal cancers. Presumably long induction periods and altered local environments after disease onset call for the development of methods for characterization of microorganisms colonizing the host decades before disease onset. Sequencing of microbial genomes in old formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) gastrointestinal biopsies provides a means for such studies but is still challenging. Here we report a method based on laser capture micro-dissection and modified Roche 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing to obtain metagenomic profiles of Helicobacter pylori. We applied this method to two 15 year old FFPE biopsies from two patients. Frozen homogenized biopsies from the same gastroscopy sessions were also available for comparison after re-culture of H. pylori. For both patients, H. pylori DNA dissected from FFPE sections had ∼96.4% identity with culture DNA from the same patients, while only ∼92.5% identity with GenBank reference genomes, and with culture DNA from the other patient. About 82% and 60% of the predicted genes in the two genomes were captured by at least a single sequencing read. Along with sequences displaying high similarity to known H. pylori genes, novel and highly variant H. pylori sequences were identified in the FFPE sections by our physical enrichment approach, which would likely not have been detected by a sequence capture approach. The study demonstrates the feasibility of longitudinal metagenomic studies of H. pylori using decade-preserved FFPE biopsies."
https://openalex.org/W2152579405,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder affecting an estimated 5-10 million people worldwide. Recent evidence has implicated several genes that directly cause or increase susceptibility to PD. As well as advancing understanding of the genetic aetiology of PD these findings suggest new ways to modify the disease course, in some cases through genetic manipulation. Here we generated a 'walk-through' series of RNA Pol III-expressed shRNAs targeting both the α-synuclein A30P and LRRK2 G2019S PD-associated mutations. Allele-specific discrimination of the α-synuclein A30P mutation was achieved with alignments at position 10, 13 and 14 in two model systems, including a heterozygous model mimicking the disease setting, whilst 5'RACE was used to confirm stated alignments. Discrimination of the most common PD-linked LRRK2 G2019S mutation was assessed in hemizygous dual-luciferase assays and showed that alignment of the mutation opposite position 4 of the antisense species produced robust discrimination of alleles at all time points studied. Discrimination at this position was subsequently confirmed using siRNAs, where up to 10-fold discrimination was seen. The results suggest that RNAi-mediated silencing of PD-associated autosomal dominant genes could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of the relevant clinical cases of PD in future."
https://openalex.org/W1967147602,"Background Osteopontin (OPN) is a member of the small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) family and a cytokine with diverse biologic roles. OPN undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including polymerization and proteolytic fragmentation, which alters its biologic activity. Recent studies suggest that OPN may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma. Methodology To determine whether secreted OPN (sOPN) is polymerized in human airways and whether it is qualitatively different in asthma, we used immunoblotting to examine sOPN in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples from 12 healthy and 21 asthmatic subjects (and in sputum samples from 27 healthy and 21 asthmatic subjects). All asthmatic subjects had mild to moderate asthma and abstained from corticosteroids during the study. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between airway sOPN and cellular inflammation. Principal Findings We found that sOPN in BAL fluid and sputum exists in polymeric, monomeric, and cleaved forms, with most of it in polymeric form. Compared to healthy subjects, asthmatic subjects had proportionately less polymeric sOPN and more monomeric and cleaved sOPN. Polymeric sOPN in BAL fluid was associated with increased alveolar macrophage counts in airways in all subjects. Conclusions These results suggest that sOPN in human airways (1) undergoes extensive post-translational modification by polymerization and proteolytic fragmentation, (2) is more fragmented and less polymerized in subjects with mild to moderate asthma, and (3) may contribute to recruitment or survival of alveolar macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2020568242,"When producing aquaculture fish feed pellets, the size of the output product is of immense importance. As the production method cannot produce pellets of constant and uniform size using constant machine settings, there is a demand for size control. Fish fed with feed pellets of improper size are prone to not grow as expected, which is undesirable to the aquaculture industry. In this paper an image analysis method is proposed for automatic size-monitoring of pellets. This is called granulometry and the method used here is based on the mathematical morphological opening operation. In the proposed method, no image object segmentation is needed. The results show that it is possible to extract a general size distribution from an image of piled disordered pellets representing both length and diameter of the pellets in combination as an area."
