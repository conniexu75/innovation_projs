https://openalex.org/W1969774671,"The W7 mouse thymoma cell line does not express the metallothionein-I (MT-I) gene in the presence of either cadmium or glucocorticoids, unlike most other cell lines. This cell line was therefore used as a model system for studying the role of DNA methylation on MT-I gene expression. The extent of DNA methylation within the MT-I gene and its flanking regions was determined by comparing the cleavage patterns generated by the isoschizomeric restriction enzymes Hpa II and Msp I. In W7 cells, all of the Hpa II sites in the vicinity of the MT-I gene are methylated, whereas in cells that have an expressible MT-I gene (for example, Friend erythroleukemia cells) all of these Hpa II sites are unmethylated. When W7 cells are treated for a few hours with 5-azacytidine, the MT-I gene becomes inducible by both cadmium and glucocorticoids. Addition of hydroxyurea along with 5-azacytidine prevents MT-I gene induction, suggesting that incorporation of 5-azacytidine into DNA is required before this gene can be activated. To determine whether 5-azacytidine treatment changes the methylation pattern near the MT-I gene, we treated W7 cells with 5-azacytidine and selected inducible cells in 10 micro M cadmium. all of the Hpa II sites within the MT-I gene are unmethylated in these cadmium-resistant W7 cells. In addition, flanking DNA sequences are also undermethylated in a pattern similar to that seen in Friend erythroleukemia cells that express the MT-I gene. The possible significance of methylation as a mechanism of gene commitment during cell differentiation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2137391369,"These studies explore the role of conformational change and exposed carbohydrate residues in the clearance of alpha 2-macroglobulin-trypsin (alpha 2M-T) complexes in the mouse. Human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) was purified and demonstrated to be homogeneous in the electrophoretic slow form. Two conformationally altered derivatives, alpha 2M-T and alpha 2-macroglobulin-methylamine (alpha 2M-MeNH2), were prepared and demonstrated to exist in the electrophoretic fast form. Radiolabeled alpha 2M-T and alpha 2M-MeNH2 were cleared rapidly with a half-life of 2-4 min following injection into mice. Radiolabeled native alpha 2M, however, remained in the circulation with a half-life of several hours. Both alpha 2M-T and alpha 2M-MeNH2 bound specifically to mouse peritoneal macrophages at 4 degrees C and occupancy of receptor sites increased with increasing time and radioligand concentration. Excess amounts of unlabeled alpha 2M-T or alpha 2M-MeNH2 cross-completed with trace amounts of the other in both clearance studies and binding assays, indicating that both derivatives were removed by the same receptor pathway. The clearance and binding of alpha 2M-T and alpha 2M-MeNH2 were not inhibited by excess amounts of unlabeled asialoorosomucoid, fucosyl-bovine serum albumin, mannosyl-BSA, or N-acetylglucosaminyl-BSA. Our results indicate that the clearance pathway removing alpha 2M-T complexes from the circulation recognizes a fundamental conformational change in alpha 2M secondary to protease binding, which can also be induced by exposure to methylamine. Therefore, other chemical or physical alterations that occur in alpha 2M upon binding trypsin, apart from the conformational change also present in alpha 2M-MeNH2, do not seem necessary for the recognition of alpha 2M-T by cells in the clearance pathway. In addition, this pathway appears distinct from several systems already described mediating clearance of glycoproteins through recognition of terminal galactose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, or mannose on oligosaccharide side chains."

https://openalex.org/W1508830093,"Forty monoclonal antibodies to acetylcholine receptor from the electric organs of Electrophorus electricus have been characterized by immunoglobulin isotype, affinity for receptor, and specificity for species, subunit, and determinants within subunits. Using these antibodies, nine immunogenic regions on the receptor molecule were distinguished. Most of these are species specific, and are located on various subunits of the acetylcholine receptor. The least species-specific forms the main immunogenic region (MIR). Most monoclonal antibodies and most antibodies in conventional antisera are directed at this region. The MIR is located on the extracellular surface of the alpha subunits and is homologous to the MIR which we previously described on Torpedo californica receptor. An homologous MIR is also a characteristic feature of receptor from mammalian muscle. The possible immunological and structural significance of the MIR is discussed."

Three different preparations of alkaline phosphatase (calf intestine, bovine liver, and Escherichia colg dephosphorylated phospho-Tyr-histones at 5-10 times the ratet hey dephosphorylated phospho-ser-histones. It was concluded that the p-nitrophenyl phosphatase and phospho-Tyr phosphatase activities reside in the same protein on the basis of high performance liquid chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, inhibition of both activities by Pi and EDTA but not fluoride, and inhibition of phospho-Tyr phosphatase activity by p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Phosphoprotein phosphatase from rabbit muscle, which had little if any p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity, dephosphorylated phospho-Ser-histones at 16 times the rate it dephosphorylated phospho-Tyrhistones. Thus, the ratio of the pseudo-first order rate constants for dephosphorylation of phospho-Tyr-histones/ phospho-Ser-histones was approximately 100 times higher for alkaline phosphatases compared to the rabbit muscle protein phosphatase. Membrane proteins from A-431 cells (phosphorylated at tyrosine) were more effective substrates than phospho-Tyr-histones as substrates for alkaline phosphatase; this was not the case for protein phosphatase. Phospho-Tyr phosphatase activity of the alkaline phosphatases was optimal in the pH range of 7-8. The so-called alkaline phosphatases, then, may be a group of membrane-bound glycoproteins that represent a class of phosphoprotein phosphatases that show selectivity for proteins phosphorylated at tyrosine residues."

https://openalex.org/W2094448488,"The proteins of the three major rate components of axonal transport in guinea pig retinal ganglion cells were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Each rate component consisted of a different set of proteins that remained associated with each other during transport. This suggests that each rate component represents a distinct macromolecular complex and that these complexes may be definable organelles such as microtubules, microfilaments, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, the transport of radiolabeled proteins in the axon reflects the movement of complete subcellular rather than the movement of individual proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2036988442,"Bodian's silver method was used to stain polypeptides of rat spinal cord or peripheral nerve separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The bands corresponding to the three polypeptide subunits of the neurofilaments were intensely impregnated. Two other polypeptides were stained inconsistently and less intensely. The tubulin band was stained weakly or not at all; other polypeptides, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, actin, and vimentin, remained unstained. This novel application of Bodian's method provides indirect proof that neurofilaments are the neuronal subcellular structure stained by the technique."

https://openalex.org/W2153985717,"Raji cells, a human B lymphoblastoid cell line of Burkitt lymphoma origin, formed lupus inclusions when grown in a medium conditioned by the growth of Raji cells whose DNA thymidine residues had been unifilarly (single-strandedly) substituted with bromodeoxyuridine. Ultracentrifugation of this medium in excess of that required to remove Epstein-Barr virus and all other known mammalian viruses did not prevent the formation of the inclusions, and treatment of the conditioned medium with pronase destroyed the activity. These results demonstrate the presence of a protein that is secreted from bromodeoxyuridine-substituted Raji cells and is capable of inducing nonbromodeoxyuridine-substituted cells to form lupus inclusions. Interferon (100 units per milliliter) was found in the conditioned medium. Inclusions also formed in Raji cells grown in fresh medium supplemented with human leukocyte or fibroblast interferon (100 units per milliliter)."

https://openalex.org/W1516179737,"Two influenza virus substrains, A/RI/5-/57 and A/RI/5+/57, with antigenically similar hemagglutinins and neuraminidases but with different properties of elution from erythrocytes, have been examined for the specificity of their interaction with cell surface sialyloligosaccharides. This was accomplished by using erythrocytes treated with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase to remove sialic acids, and then modified with CMP-NeuAc and three purified sialyltransferases to contain either the NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal, NeuAc alpha 2,6Gal, or NeuAc alpha 2,6GalNAc linkages on cell-surface glycoproteins. Each virus was tested for its ability to adsorb to and hydrolyze sialic acid from the derivatized cells. The hemagglutinins of the A/RI/5-/57 and A/RI/5+/57 viruses were found to have totally different specificities, binding respectively to the NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal and NeuAc alpha 2,6Gal linkages as preferred receptor determinants. In contrast, the neuraminidases of the two viruses exhibited similar specificities, efficiently hydrolyzing only the NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal linkage. The results suggest that the difference in the ability of the A/RI/5-/57 and A/RI/5+/57 viruses to elute from erythrocytes resides in the different receptor specificities of their hemagglutinins. Indeed, it appears that A/RI/5-/57 virus elutes because its receptor determinant, NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal, is rapidly hydrolyzed by the viral neuraminidase, while the A/RI/5+/57 virus fails to elute because its preferred receptor determinant NeuAc alpha 2,6Gal is largely resistant to hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1615873781,"The effect of cAMP analogues on phosphatidylcholine formation via the CDP-choline pathway was investigated in cultured monolayers of rat hepatocytes. Treatment with chlorophenylthio-cAMP or the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, aminophylline, reduced the total uptake of [methyl-3H]choline by 32 and 26% (p less than 0.01), respectively. Chlorophenylthio-cAMP inhibited the incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline into phosphatidylcholine by 2.5-fold (p less than 0.001) and reduced the rate of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis by approximately 40%. Aminophylline, 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and N6,O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-monophosphate also inhibited [methyl-3H]choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine. Although choline kinase and phosphocholinetransferase activities were stimulated by chlorophenylthio-cAMP treatment, CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity was reduced 46% (p less than 0.01). The results indicate that cytidylyltransferase may be phosphorylated and inhibited by cAMP-dependent protein kinases."

https://openalex.org/W2063390418,"A 36 kilobase (kb) DNA segment of the Drosophila genome that contains several larval cuticle protein genes has been cloned and characterized. This segment maps at chromosomal locus 44D. It contains five genes, all of which are expressed at the same time of Drosophila development. Four of the genes are clustered within 7.9 kb of DNA and are abundantly expressed as poly(A)RNA in the epidermis of late third instar larvae but are not abundantly expressed in other developmental stages. A fifth gene lies 8 kb away from this cluster and is expressed at a much lower level in late third instar larval poly(A) RNA. Three of the four abundantly expressed genes have been shown to code for larval cuticle proteins; less decisive evidence indicates that the fourth gene also probably codes for a larval cuticle protein. Some of the genes are related in DNA sequence, and the proteins encoded in the cluster are related immunologically. Thus the cuticle genes encoded by the segment at 44D are members of a family of genes of common ancestry, which share the same pattern of developmental expression and reside in a small segment of the Drosophila genome."

https://openalex.org/W1558991162,"Poly(A)-rich RNA was isolated from developing soybean seeds (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and fractionated on linear log sucrose gradients. Two major fractions sedimenting at 18 S and 20 S were separated and then purified by further sucrose gradient fractionation. Both fractions were active as messengers when added to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate protein synthesis system. The 18 S fraction caused proteins migrating primarily to the 60,000-dalton region of a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel to be produced, while translation of the 20 S fraction preferentially directed the synthesis of polypeptides similar in size to the alpha and alpha' subunits of beta-conglycinin. Evidence that many of the 60,000-dalton polypeptides were related to glycinin and the high molecular weight 20 S translation products were related to beta-conglycinin was obtained by immunoprecipitation using monospecific antibodies against glycinin and beta-conglycinin, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the immunoprecipitated products revealed that the glycinin precursor region contained at least three different size components and that the family of glycinin precursors had larger apparent molecular weight (58,000-63,000) than the disulfide-linked complexes between acidic and basic glycinin subunits (57,000). Unlike the disulfide-linked glycinin complexes which were cleaved by disulfide reduction, glycinin precursors were insensitive to reducing agents. The alpha and alpha' subunits synthesized in vitro also had slightly larger apparent molecular weights than purified alpha and alpha' standards."

During perfusion of this intestinal segment in vivo, there was a constant basal rate of intraluminal secretion of this amine. The rate of secretion was significantly increased during efferent electrical stimulation of the cut cervical vagal nerves. This stimulatory effect was not altered after bilateral adrenalectomy was performed in the same animals. A synchronous release of substance P into the gut lumen was also demonstrated during vagal stimulation. During the period of increased intraluminal secretion of immunoreactive serotonin, there was no demonstrable change in the portal or systemic blood levels of this amine."
https://openalex.org/W2113322434,"Previous nucleotide sequence studies have demonstrated that the structural genes for four transfer RNA species (thrU, tyrU, glyT and thrT) are positioned close to one another and near tufB, one of the structural genes for elongation factor Tu. We have carried out experiments to determine the position of the tufB promoter and thus to infer whether these five genes are in a single transcription unit. tufB cloned on plasmids was fused to Tc (in operon fusion) or to lacZ (in gene fusion). These plasmids were then subjected to in vitro deletion to locate the promoter responsible for tufB transcription. In addition, the ability of wild-type tufB to complement kirromycin resistance was determined with deletion plasmids. The results indicate that the major promoter for tufB lies upstream from the four transfer RNA genes, and that there might be at least one weak internal promoter, possibly adjacent to tufB. Assuming that the four tRNA genes that lie between the major promoter and tufB are also transcribed from that promoter, we suggest that all five genes lie in a single transcription unit (thrUp-thrU-tyrU-glyT-thrT-tufB-tufBt) whose primary transcript is thus both a transfer RNA precursor and a messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1255332801,"C4a anaphylatoxin is derived from the fourth component (C4) of the blood complement system. The C4 alpha-chain is selectively cleaved between positions 77 and 78 by the protease C1s, a subcomponent of C1, generating the fragments C4a and C4b. Human C4a was isolated directly from fresh serum after C1 of the classical pathway of complement was activated by heat-aggregated gamma-globulin. The C4a anaphylatoxin is a cationic polypeptide of Mr = 9000 composed of 77 residues and devoid of histidine, tryptophan, and carbohydrate. The primary structure of human C4a was deduced from sequence analysis of two cyanogen bromide fragments and of peptides obtained after chymotryptic digestion of the COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide fragment. The proposed sequence is: (formula, see text) Manual alignment of the linear structures of human C3a, C4a, and C5a, based primarily on the location of two Cys-Cys sequences in each indicate a 30% homology between C3a and C4a and a 36% homology between C5a and C4a. It was concluded from the sequence comparison that C3a, C4a, and C5a are a family of bioactive factors derived from precursor molecules that share a common genetic origin. Although the human anaphylatoxins share a partial structural identity and express similar biological activities, these factors ae immunologically distinct molecules having no antigenic determinants in common as judged by radioimmunoassay."
https://openalex.org/W1553159886,"Vanadate (10 mM) strongly inhibited endogenous protein degradation as well as the degradation of an exogenous, endocytosed protein (asialofetuin) in isolated rat hepatocytes. Protein synthesis and cellular viability were unaffected, but changes in cell morphology suggested some interference with cytoskeletal elements. The effect of vanadate was comparable to the effects of several other degradation inhibitors (lysosomotropic amines, leupeptin, vinblastine, amino acids, dimethylaminopurine riboside) known to inhibit the autophagic/lysosomal pathway of protein degradation. Vanadate inhibited proteolysis in a liver homogenate at pH 5, suggesting a direct effect upon the lysosomal proteinases."

https://openalex.org/W2116239878,"Interferon-treated HeLa cells were incubated with [3H]uridine to label mRNA and were then exposed to the double-stranded RNA poly(inosinic acid).poly(cytidylic acid) (In.Cn). The incubation with In.Cn greatly enhanced the decay of mRNA. When the cells were incubated in this way in the presence of cycloheximide, which blocks ribosome movement along mRNA, extensive polysome degradation was detected in interferon-treated cells. Products of degradation of mRNA were recovered from monosomes which were presumably formed as a result of endonucleolytic breaks of mRNA. This endonucleolytic activity was correlated with the formation of 2',5'-oligo(A) by an enzyme induced by interferon and activated by double-stranded RNA; the 2',5'-oligo(A) was previously shown to activate an endonuclease in cell extracts. The 2',5'-oligo(A) levels in cells were measured by a competition-binding assay. Details of the procedure used are described, including synthesis of highly radioactive (2'-5')pppA3[32P]cytidine 3',5'-diphosphate, separation of 2',5'-oligo(A) binding from degrading activities, and specificity of the assay."
https://openalex.org/W1529295649,"Rabbit alveolar macrophages exhibit high affinity surface receptors which recognize alpha 2-macroglobulin . protease complexes but not native alpha 2- macroglobulin. Binding of alpha 2-macroglobulin . protease complexes to surface receptors is independent of the protease used to form the complex. In this communication, we demonstrate that treatment of human alpha 2-macroglobulin with nucleophilic agents (methyl amine, ammonium salts) converts native alpha 2-macroglobulin into a form recognized by the surface receptor for alpha 2-macroglobulin protease complexes. Analysis of the concentration dependency of ligand binding revealed that the surface receptor did not distinguish between nucleophile-treated alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 2-macroglobulin . protease complexes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proteases or nucleophilic agents effect the hydrolysis of an internal thiol-ester bond (Tack, B. F., Harrison, R. A., Janatova, J., Thomas, M. L., and Prahl, J. W. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 5764-5768), leading to an alteration in alpha 2-macroglobulin conformation. The altered conformation results in recognition of the alpha 2-macroglobulin by surface receptors."

A gapped duplex DNA was the preferred substrate for this exonuclease activity since the hydrolytic activity on this type of DNA was much greater than the hydrolysis of either native or heat-denatured DNA. Using 3'-terminally labeled activated calf thymus DNA as substrate, the exonuclease activity was found to be activated by salt and spermidine in a manner identical with HSV-1 DNA polymerase. This activation was accompanied by increases in apparent Km and Vmax values of the activated DNA substrate. Phosphonoformic acid inhibited both DNA polymerase and exonuclease activities uncompetitively with respect to activated DNA and had a Ki of 2.4 microM at an ionic strength of 0.25 mu. Of the nucleoside 5'-monophosphates tested only the purine ribonucleotides inhibited the exonuclease activity. The inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to DNA, and GMP was about twice as potent as AMP or IMP. 9-beta-D-arabinosyladenine 5'-monophosphate (araAMP) could be incorporated into DNA by HSV-1 DNA polymerase; however, 9-beta-D-arabinosyladenine 5'-triphosphate would not replace dATP in supporting in vitro HSV-1 DNA synthesis. AraAMP incorporated into primer termini caused a significant decrease in the rate of subsequent primer elongation. These 3'-terminal araAMP residues could be removed by the HSV-1 DNA polymerase-associated exonuclease activity in a manner dependent on GMP concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1601784606,"Soybean trypsin inhibitor, a protein of Mr = 20,000, has been used to assess the degree of inaccessibility of porcine trypsin within the alpha 2-macroglobulin-trypsin complex. The interaction between alpha 2-macroglobulin-bound trypsin and the inhibitor was demonstrated by affinity chromatography and trypsin inhibition. Whereas the free trypsin-inhibitor association is very fast (k = 1.2 X 10(7) M-1 s-1), the reaction between complexed trypsin and inhibitor takes 10 h to reach equilibrium. In addition, alpha 2-macroglobulin reduces, by several orders of magnitude, the affinity of trypsin for the inhibitor. Only one of the two trypsin molecules of the ternary (trypsin)2-alpha 2-macroglobulin complex is readily accessible to soybean inhibitor. It is postulated that the recently discovered proximity of the alpha 2-macroglobulin binding sites (Pochon, F., Favaudon, V., Tourbez-Perrin, M., and Bieth, J. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 547-550) accounts for this behavior. In the light of these results it is concluded that the proteinase binding sites are localized on the alpha 2-macroglobulin surface and that the two subunits of this protein are either not identical or not symmetrically arranged."
https://openalex.org/W2018467146,"Affinity-purified antibodies prepared against the major coat protein of brain coated vesicles, clathrin, were microinjected into cultured fibroblasts, and their intracellular distribution was followed by immunofluorescence microscopy and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry. Microinjected anticlathrin antibodies were concentrated on coated regions of the plasma membrane and the GERL apparatus. When an excess of anticlathrin antibodies was injected into the cytosol, coated pits on the plasma membrane were covered by anticlathrin antibody but still functioned to cluster an internalize alpha2-macroglobulin. These results are discussed in terms of the role of clathrin in the pathway of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Our data indicate that in cultured fibroblasts coated pits are stable elements permanently attached to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1597877943,"(2'-5')(A)n synthetase is one of the mediators of interferon action. If activated by double-stranded RNA it converts ATP into pyrophosphate and (2'-5')(A)n. In turn, (2'-5')(A)n activates a latent endoribonuclease (RNase L) which cleaves single-stranded RNA. We report here the isolation and characterization of a homogeneous human (2'-5')(A)n synthetase. The enzyme was purified from interferon-treated HeLA S3 cells by chromatography of a ribosomal salt wash fraction on DEAE-cellulose, poly(I) . poly(C) agarose, and CM-cellulose. The purified (2'-5')(A)n synthetase can convert over 90% of ATP into (2'-5')(A)n. The enzyme is unstable but can be stabilized by certain nonionic detergents (e.g. Triton X-100). Its apparent Mr = 100,000, as determined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, and about 80,000, as determined by centrifugation through a glycerol gradient. The human (2'-5')(A)n synthetase is similar to the corresponding enzyme from mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, but differs from the latter in size (100,000 versus 105,000 daltons) and in ionic conditions required for maximal activity."

https://openalex.org/W2039279446,"Interferons are being tested as antiviral and antitumour agents in man1–5, but because of their limited availability, clinical trials have remained inconclusive. Most of the interferon (IFN) preparations tested in man have been derived from human peripheral blood, buffy-coat leukocytes (HuIFN-α)6 induced by Sendai virus or from human diploid fibroblastoid cells (HuIFN-β) superinduced with poly(rI)-poly(rC)7. As production of interferon from leukocytes is restricted by the availability of blood donors, and production from cultured cells is a laborious and relatively costly process, the use of recombinant DNA technology may provide the most economical approach to the large-scale production of pure species of human interferon. The testing of such interferons is in its infancy. With the availability of bacterially produced HuIFN-α2 we have been able to compare its activity against vaccinia virus infection of the rhesus monkey with that of HuIFN-α from leukocyte buffy coats. Here we provide evidence that the two human α-interferons have comparable antiviral activity but that the bacterially produced form has fewer side effects, at least in the rhesus monkey."
https://openalex.org/W1532324074,"Monoclonal antibodies to hyaluronidase-treated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) were used to study the immunological determinants of chick cartilage proteoglycan. The determinants recognized by the antibodies were studied by a radioimmune inhibition assay utilizing hyaluronidase-treated [35S]CSPG. Hyaluronidase-treated CSPG inhibits the reaction of four clonal antibodies, S54C, S103L, S11D, and P100D, with [35S]CSPG, but to varying degrees. Only the reaction of S103L is inhibited to a considerable extent by undigested CSPG, indicating that hyaluronidase treatment exposes determinants specific for the other three antibodies. These findings are consistent with the earlier conclusion that S103L is specific for a protein determinant (Dorfman et al., 1980). Only the reaction of S54C is not significantly inhibited by chondroitinase ABC-digested CSPG. This result indicates that chondroitinase ABC digestion can also expose determinants recognized by S11D and P100D but that such digestion removes the determinant recognized by S54C. Of the four antibodies tested, only the reaction of S54C with hyaluronidase-treated [35S]CSPG is significantly inhibited by chondroitin-6-SO4 tetra- and hexasaccharide (59 and 43% inhibition, respectively, at a concentration of 1333 microM). The reaction of S54C is inhibited to a lesser extent by chondroitin tetra- and hexasaccharide (28 and 26% inhibition, respectively, at a concentration of 1333 microM). In contrast, chondroitin-4-SO4 oligosaccharides do not inhibit the reactions of any of the clonal antibodies. These result suggest that S54C recognizes a determinant that contains chondroitin-6-SO4 oligosaccharide, attached via the linkage oligosaccharide to core protein."

These effects were antagonized by intraventricular administration of drugs that prevent the formation of angiotensin II or block its receptors. The fact that these angiotensin-blocking drugs did not change the sodium intake of sodium-deficient sheep challenges the idea that central angiotensin action is involved in sodium appetite due to a deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2045388410,"The polymorphic major histocompatiblity antigens (H–2) have a crucial role in the activation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Thus, H–2 antigens are not only recognized by allogeneic lymphocytes leading to generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), but it has also been demonstrated that in syngeneic systems most T cells are only able to recognize foreign antigens in conjunction with their own MHC (major histocompatibility complex) antigens. This phenomenon, termed H–2 restriction1, may be the key to our understanding of the biological function of MHC antigens. It is not clear whether recognition by T cells of H–2 on a molecular level is confined to particular domains on the H–2 molecule, nor whether the same polymorphic H–2 sites, which are characterized by antibodies, are recognized by allogeneic as well as by H–2-restricted syngeneic CTLs. Previous findings2 indicate the existence of at least two major polymorphic domains on the H–2Kk molecule as defined by antibodies. Here we show the existence of CTLs with specifity for these polymorphic domains, and the preferential recognition of a particular domain by both alloreactive as well as H–2-restricted CTLs."

This is an indication that biopterin levels are regulated by an adrenergic cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent mechanism. The decline in tissue biopterin content, produced mainly by inhibited of biosynthesis, is maximal at 6 hours and is not associated with either an increase in biopterin release or a shift in the reduction state of the biopterin."

It is shown that Ru(NH3)62+/3+ is an efficient electron donor directly to cytochrome oxidase, without mediation by cytochrome c. The steady state kinetics of electron transfer from Ru(NH3)62+ to purified oxidase resembles that of cytochrome c, showing a biphasic pattern but higher apparent Km values (Km1 = 8 microM, Km2 = 88 microM). Under conditions that favor tight binding to the oxidase, cytochrome c acts as a competitive inhibitor of Ru(NH3)62+, indicating that the two electron donors interact with cytochrome oxidase at the same site(s). The efficiency of Ru(NH3)62+ as an electron mediator to cytochrome aa3 and the similarity of its kinetic behavior to that of cytochrome c, make it a potentially valuable tool for investigating the mechanism of energy conservation in the terminal segment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain."

The gamma 95-264 segment was generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage of the gamma chain and isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Rabbit antisera to this peptide and to gamma chain recognized at least five antigenic loci uniformly distributed throughout this segment. In primary binding assays, antibodies to gamma 95-264 bound gamma 95-264, free gamma chain, and fibrinogen fragment D, but not native fibrinogen. Also, gamma 95-264 was bound by antibodies to gamma chain and fibrinogen fragment D, but not by antibodies generated to native fibrinogen. Thus, the gamma 95-264 sequence was not accessible to antibody in the native structure. In competitive equilibrium radioimmunoassays, neither native fibrinogen nor highly soluble fibrinogen fraction I-9 inhibited the binding of gamma 95-264 by its antiserum or anti-gamma chain. With plasmic cleavage, however, the gamma 95-264 sequence became accessible to antibody and the series of fragments D greater than Y greater than D:E = X describes the relative reactivity of the gamma chain sequence in fibrinogen degradation products. Differential expression of gamma 95-264 antigenic loci was also observed with D fragments differing in molecular weight. Plasmic cleavage of cross-linked and noncross-linked fibrin generated D fragments which did not express gamma 95-264 as well as fibrinogen D derivatives, indicating that the D domains of fibrinogen and fibrin are immunochemically distinguishable. These findings indicate that the central segment of the gamma chain is inaccessible to antibody in native fibrinogen, but that proper surface orientation is achieved upon plasmic degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1528099054,"The Mn2+-dependent endonuclease activity associated with the avian myeloblastosis virus RNA-directed DNA polymerase has been shown to be activated by ATP in the presence of Mg2+. In the presence of Mn2+ the endonucleolytic activity was stimulated about 3-fold by the addition of ATP. The earlier identified Mr = 40,000 Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)-associated endonuclease which functions in the presence of both Mg2+ and Mn2+ has also been shown to be similarly stimulated by ATP. For both endonuclease activities stimulation was only observed at ATP concentrations above 0.5 mM, and it did not increase upon elevating the ATP concentration above 2.5 mM. ADP and dATP also stimulated both activities, although not to the same extent as ATP. GTP had no apparent effect and AMP seemed to inhibit both activities. The effect ATP analogs had on the F-MuLV associated endonuclease activity could suggest that the endonuclease reaction in the presence of ATP might involve the cleavage of beta-gamma phosphate bonds in ATP. Neither adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate nor (beta, gamma-methylene)adenosine 5'-triphosphate stimulated the activity, whereas significant stimulation was observed in the presence of (alpha, beta-methylene)adenosine 5'-triphosphate. Although no ATPase activity could be detected in the purified F-MuLV endonuclease preparation, the data do not exclude the possibility that ATP may be cleaved in amounts which are equivalent to the number of nicks introduced into DNA by the virus-associated endonuclease. In the presence of ATP and Mg2+ the F-MuLV-associated endonuclease nicked both supercoiled and linear DNA duplexes extensively, although the former was nicked more readily than the latter. Single-stranded DNA functioned poorly as a substrate. The nicks introduced by the enzyme contained a 5'-phosphoryl terminus and a 3'-hydroxyl group."
