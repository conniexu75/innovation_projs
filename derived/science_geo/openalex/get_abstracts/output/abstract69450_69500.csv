https://openalex.org/W1923027407,"A specific and sensitive assay for disulfide groups has been developed, based on reduction with dithioerythritol or dithiothreitol and determination of the resulting monothiols with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the presence of arsenite. The dissociation constants for the complexes formed between arsenite and dithioerythritol, dithiothreitol, 1,3-dithioglycerol, and 1,2-dithioglycerol have been measured, as well as the rate constants for the formation and breakdown of the complexes and for the bimolecular reaction between the complexes and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The pK values of dithiothreitol are 8.3 and 9.5, and those for dithioerythritol are 9.0 and 9.9."
https://openalex.org/W1501993347,"A method is described by which rate equations for enzymic reactions under the equilibrium assumptions may be derived by inspecting the reaction pathways without solving simultaneous equations in the conventional way. Also described is a simple graphic method which combines the above technique with King and Altman's method. By the latter method, rate equations may be derived with minimal effort for complicated enzymic mechanisms in which some steps are considerably faster than the rest so that the enzymic species connected by those rapid steps may be at a near equilibrium while the over-all reaction is in a steady state. Rate equations are derived, for the purpose of illustration, for the reversible single substrate-single modifier system, the partial equilibrium ping-pong bi-bi mechanism, the general mechanism for two-substrate system, and a complicated three-substrate mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1527360379,"A rapid and simple procedure for the preparation of sperm whale ferrimyoglobin is described. The method involves homogenization in 70% saturated ammonium sulfate at 4° and chromatography on carboxymethyl Sephadex. The major component was judged to be homogeneous by electrophoresis at two pH values and by analytical chromatography on sulfoethyl Sephadex at a third pH value. The method has also been utilized to prepare electrophoretically pure myoglobin from harbor seal and porpoise. The amino acid composition and amino-terminal end groups of harbor seal and porpoise myoglobin have been determined, and the results compared with sperm whale myoglobin. Each protein was found to possess 153 amino acid residues with a single amino-terminal end group. Both harbor seal and porpoise myoglobins have glycine as the amino-terminal residue, in contrast to the sperm whale protein, which contains a single residue of valine. The amino acid compositions indicate a close similarity among all three myoglobins and suggest that only a limited number of amino acid substitutions in the primary structure differentiates the three proteins. The molar extinction coefficients and the reduced mean residue rotation at 233 mµ were found to be essentially identical in the three myoglobins, indicating that the three-dimensional structure in solution is probably very nearly identical for sperm whale, harbor seal, and porpoise ferrimyoglobins."
https://openalex.org/W1588826238,"Abstract A scheme has been devised for the purification of glutathione reductase from bakers' yeast. The purified protein is homogeneous with respect to chromatographic, electrophoretic, and sedimentation criteria. A molecular weight of 1.24 ± 0.05 x 105 was calculated for the protein from sedimentation equilibrium and osmotic pressure measurements. In the presence of 5 m guanidine hydrochloride, the molecular weight is reduced to 5.15 ± 0.3 x 104 calculated from sedimentation equilibrium experiments, assuming no preferential interaction with the solvent, or to 5.60 x 104 calculated from osmotic pressure measurements. These values indicate that the native protein contains two polypeptide chains. The dissociated polypeptide chains appear identical with respect to net charge and molecular size. The native enzyme was found to contain 2 moles of FAD per mole of protein. Both FAD moieties can be separated from the dissociated protein by dialysis or electrophoresis, indicating that FAD is attached to the native protein by noncovalent bonds."

https://openalex.org/W1521935871,"Abstract Histones are methylated after synthesis by a transfer of methyl groups (derived from methionine) to the free e-amino groups of lysine residues in the polypeptide chain. The time courses of histone synthesis and methylation have been compared during regeneration of the liver in the rat. Uniformly labeled arginine-14C and methionine-(methyl-14C) were used as precursors, and the e-N-methyllysines were separated from the other amino acids in the protein digest. The histones were fractionated by differential acetone precipitation to yield an arginine-rich fraction containing 0.91 mole per 100 moles of e-N-methyllysines. e-N-Dimethyllysine is the predominant form of the modified amino acid. Its concentration exceeds that of the monomethyl derivative by a factor of 3. Histone methylation is a relatively late event in the course of cell division after partial hepatectomy. The peak in methylation occurs at a time when the rates of histone synthesis and DNA synthesis have already begun to decline. Methylation of histones does not correlate with an increase in DNA template activity for RNA synthesis, nor with the initiation of histone, nonhistone protein, or DNA synthesis. It may correlate with structural and functional changes known to occur in the nucleus prior to mitosis, which involve a condensation of the chromatin and a curtailment of nucleic acid synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1552981157,"Abstract Approximately 90% of the total tyrosine hydroxylase activity of bovine adrenal medulla homogenates was localized in the particulate fraction of the homogenate. The particulate enzyme was solubilized by incubation with trypsin, and the solubilized enzyme was partially purified. This enzyme was found to behave like the tyrosine hydroxylase which had been purified from the supernatant fraction by Nagatsu, Levitt, and Udenfriend, in that a tetrahydropteridine is required as cofactor and the enzyme is inhibited by certain tyrosine analogues and catechol derivatives. Partially purified tyrosine hydroxylase requires the addition of Fe2+, and maximum activity is found when the enzyme has previously been incubated with Fe2+. In contrast, incubation of the enzyme with Fe2+ results in almost complete loss of activity, although both forms of iron are active without prior incubation. The enzyme is markedly inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, indicating the presence of an essential sulfhydryl group on the enzyme. Nevertheless, prior incubation of the enzyme with mercaptoethanol results in inhibition of hydroxylation."

The smallest concentrations eliciting both responses were below 100 nanograms per milliliter. Relative activities of (alpha)-, beta3-, and (gamma)-tocopherol and (alpha)-tocopheryl-quinone were roughly 100 : 100 : 20 : 0.4. The synthetic antioxidants tested were without activity."
https://openalex.org/W1856514772,"Abstract When deoxyadenosylcobalamin was incubated with ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii, dihydrolipoate, and a nucleoside triphosphate in the presence of tritiated water, labeled hydrogen was incorporated into nonexchangeable positions in the cobamide. A maximum of 1.4 atoms of labeled hydrogen was incorporated per molecule of deoxyadenosylcobalamin. On photolysis of the labeled cobamide the radioactivity was found in the 5'-hydrogen atoms of the nucleoside products derived from the deoxyadenosyl moiety. This result indicates that the hydrogen atoms of the methylene group bound to cobalt in the cobamide exchange with water, a conclusion confirmed by nonenzymic synthesis of 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin-5'-3H2 and the demonstration that tritium is transferred from this compound into water. This hydrogen exchange occurred only in the presence of enzyme, dithiol, and a nucleotide. The dithiol requirement could be met by 1,3- or 1,4-dithiols or by the thioredoxin system, but monothiols were relatively ineffective. Ribonucleoside triphosphates could satisfy the nucleotide requirement, but deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were also active and dGTP was the most effective nucleotide of all. Nucleoside mono- and diphosphates were less effective than the corresponding triphosphates. The specificity of the nucleotide requirement, the absence of hydrogen transfer to or from the activating nucleotide, and the fact that deoxynucleotides did not undergo detectable reaction in the system suggest that nucleotides act as allosteric activators of the hydrogen exchange reaction. The enzymic transfer of hydrogen between water and the 5'-methylene group of the cobamide is considered to occur via the dithiol and to indicate the reversible formation of a reduced cobamide intermediate, probably identical with that occurring in the mutase reactions that require deoxyadenosylcobalamin and in the diol dehydrase reaction. In ribonucleotide reduction this reduced cobamide intermediate is regarded as the immediate donor of a hydride ion to position 2' α of the nucleotide substrate. Attempts to obtain evidence of the existence of this intermediate by incorporating label from deoxyadenosylcobalamin-5'-3H2 into the deoxynucleotide product of the reductase or by dilution by unlabeled deoxyadenosylcobalamin of tritium incorporation from water into deoxynucleotide product were unsuccessful. However, as required by the hypothesis, inactivation of the enzyme for the hydrogen transfer reaction under various conditions always resulted in parallel or greater inactivation for ribonucleotide reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1566819067,"Abstract Methods for preparing troponin and tropomyosin from ethanol-extracted muscle are presented. Examination of these proteins by disc electrophoresis indicated that the troponin preparation is homogeneous. If precautions were taken to assure that the —SH groups of tropomyosin were not permitted to oxidize during preparation or electrophoresis, tropomyosin appeared to be nearly homogeneous. Traces of troponin, however, appeared in all samples. Neither troponin nor tropomyosin was found to make actomyosin superprecipitation sensitive to the removal of Ca++. Combined, they were effective. A moderately wide range of troponin to tropomyosin ratios (between 1:1 and 3:1) were found to provide optimal sensitization of actomyosin. At a troponin to tropomyosin ratio of 1.3:1, 35 µg of this protein mixture inhibited by 85% 200 µg of actomyosin. The ability of troponin to collaborate with tropomyosin in the sensitization of actomyosin was lost to varying degrees if the troponin —SH groups were allowed to react with p-chloromercuribenzoate or N-ethylmaleimide or if the —SH groups were not protected during preparation. In contrast, the function of tropomyosin was found not to correlate with the state of its —SH groups. Troponin was found to be a potent calcium-binding substance, possessing 24 µmoles of high affinity calcium-binding sites per g. The high affinity site had an apparent affinity constant of approximately 2.4 x 106 m-1. It is hypothesized that the binding of calcium to this site inactivates troponin and that this is the mechanism whereby calcium activates myofibrillar contraction. It is concluded that tropomyosin does not possess a similar class of calcium-binding sites. The affinity of troponin for calcium was unaltered by reaction of its —SH groups. The number of high affinity calcium-binding sites was, however, doubled to approximately 40 µmoles of sites per g by reaction of troponin with —SH reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1482748464,"Abstract The peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus epidermidis contains serine and glycine in the interpeptide bridges. A particulate enzyme system has been obtained which catalyzes peptidoglycan synthesis from the uridine nucleotides substrates and a transfer RNA (tRNA)-dependent incorporation of both serine and glycine into the peptidoglycan. Maximum serine incorporation requires simultaneous incorporation of glycine, but glycine incorporation is independent of serine incorporation. Serine and glycine are first activated, attached to tRNA, and then transferred to a lipid intermediate of peptidoglycan synthesis. Finally, this lipid intermediate is utilized in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan. The seryl-tRNAs of this organism have been separated into four seryl-tRNA fractions. Three of these function both in peptidoglycan synthesis and in protein synthesis, as examined by various methods. The fourth seryl-tRNA participates equally well in peptidoglycan synthesis, but it has not been possible to demonstrate its participation in protein synthesis or in triplet-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes by using triplets corresponding to all of the known serine codons."

https://openalex.org/W1516466129,"Abstract An assay system for the determination of aminoacyl transfer RNA binding to ribosomes has been developed which involves the isolation of ribosomes from incubation mixtures containing puromycin or puromycin-treated ribosomes, by means of discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation or adsorption on Millipore membrane filters. One of the aminoacyl-transferring enzymes, transferase I, catalyzes the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes in the absence of peptide bond synthesis. The requirement for transferase I, in 6 mm magnesium ion-containing solutions, is absolute; the other aminoacyl-transferring enzyme, transferase II, is inactive. Ammonium and magnesium ions are necessary, and guanosine triphosphate stimulates the interaction. At higher (20 mm) magnesium ion concentrations, significant binding of aminoacyl-tRNA occurs in the absence of transferase I, and it is stimulated to some extent by the addition of the enzyme. In contrast to the transferase I-dependent (low Mg++) binding, which is prevented by the presence of 12C-aminoacyl-tRNA but not by stripped tRNA, the transferase I-independent (high Mg++) binding is equally inhibited by the presence of 12C-aminoacyl-tRNA and stripped tRNA. GTP appears to have multiple sites of action in the aminoacyl transfer reaction; the effect on the aminoacyl-tRNA-binding reaction described here represents an additional role of this nucleotide. These results, which are consistent with previous observations made in this laboratory, suggest that transferase I reacts with aminoacyl-tRNA and then, as the complex, with ribosomes. Thus, transferase I behaves as an aminoacyl-tRNA ribosome-binding enzyme, which catalyzes the first step in the series of reactions between free aminoacyl-tRNA and peptidyl tRNA."

Procedures have been developed for the separation of the amide and the amide-free forms of the lipid intermediates, and it has been shown that the amide-free lipid intermediate can substitute for the uridine nucleotide substrates in the amidation reaction. Some properties of the reaction are reported."
https://openalex.org/W1556172762,"Abstract Myoglobins from sperm whale, harbor seal, and harbor porpoise were compared with respect to their behavior in several reactions. Qualitative similarities were established in each case, but quantitative differences were also observed. Despite close similarities in the hydrogen ion titration curves, the titration parameters of the imidazole groups were not identical. In this respect, the whale and porpoise proteins showed the most points of similarity. By contrast, the hemic acid dissociation constants for the seal and porpoise proteins were indistinguishable, and differed from the value for the whale protein by approximately 0.33 in pK units. The sharpest contrasts were obtained in the rates of denaturation by cupric ion, in which the whale protein was set apart in two respects. First, its reaction rate was much slower in an inert buffer. Second, its reaction rate was much more effectively depressed by addition of small quantities of phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1501863431,"Abstract A particulate enzyme system from Micrococcus roseus R27 has been obtained which catalyzes the biosynthesis of a peptidoglycan. The preparation catalyzes the incorporation of l-threonine onto the e-amino group of lysine in the presence of transfer RNA (tRNA), supernatant solution, and ATP. Crude 14C-l-threonyl-tRNA will substitute for these additional requirements. The threonyl-tRNAs of this organism have been separated into two fractions, each of which participates in both peptidoglycan and protein biosynthesis. The amino acid-coding properties of the two threonyl-tRNAs in polypeptide synthesis are reported. l-Alanine is also found in the interpeptide bridge of M. roseus R27, but only indirect evidence for the incorporation of l-alanine into the interpeptide bridge following the incorporation of l-threonine could be obtained."

The incorporation of l-alanine required l-alanyl transfer RNA (l-alanyl-tRNA) as an intermediate. l-Cysteinyl-tRNA was converted to l-alanyl-tRNA by reduction with Raney nickel, as previously described in studies of protein synthesis. This l-alanyl-tRNAcys did not participate detectably in peptidoglycan synthesis. There is therefore some specificity in the participation of tRNA in peptidoglycan synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2095646374,"Abstract The earlier observation of George and Hanania that the apparent pK' value for the hemic acid dissociation of horse ferrimyoglobin is insensitive to changes in over-all net protein charge imparted by titration over the range of pH from 8 to 10 is extended to the ferrimyoglobins of sperm whale, harbor seal, and harbor porpoise. The state of net charge of each of the latter three proteins has also been altered by alkylation of exposed histidyl residues with iodoacetamide, so that the carboxamidomethylated and unmodified proteins could be compared directly at a series of identical pH values in the range of titration of the hemic acid. This modification imparts a relative positive charge, but it is found again that the pK' value for the hemic acid dissociation is not affected. The same observation was made with sperm whale ferrimyoglobin alkylated with bromoacetate so that the effect of imparting a relative negative charge by carboxymethylation could be tested. It is concluded that the classical formulation in terms of over-all net protein charge is not applicable, and that the groups of which the state of charge has been altered are too far from the heme iron to influence the hemic acid dissociation. This dissociation is sensitive, however, to species differences in the environment of the heme."

Particularly high yields of acylated ε-amino groups were obtained when dimethylsulphoxide was used as reaction medium. A sample of mohair which had been treated for 24 h at 40° C in this solvent, however, showed a somewhat diffuse X-ray pattern.

The inactivation that takes place concomitant with binding of only a few atoms of iodine per molecule of aldolase is not accompanied by a gross conformational change in the enzyme. It is concluded that iodination of a specific tyrosyl residue or residues of muscle aldolase is responsible for the marked inactivation. A significant portion of the iodine incorporated is associated with the COOH-terminal tyrosyl residues. Two COOH-terminal tryptic peptides have been isolated with the use of 125I as the marker, and the amino acid compositions of these peptides have been determined."
