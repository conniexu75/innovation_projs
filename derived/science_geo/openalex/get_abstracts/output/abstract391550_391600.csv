We have generated more than 700 data sets and discovered protein-coding, noncoding, RNA regulatory, replication, and chromatin elements, more than tripling the annotated portion of the Drosophila genome. Correlated activity patterns of these elements reveal a functional regulatory network, which predicts putative new functions for genes, reveals stage- and tissue-specific regulators, and enables gene-expression prediction. Our results provide a foundation for directed experimental and computational studies in Drosophila and related species and also a model for systematic data integration toward comprehensive genomic and functional annotation."

In this vein, Gerstein et al. (p. 1775 ) summarize for the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, and The modENCODE Consortium (p. 1787 ) summarize for the Drosophila melanogaster genome, full transcriptome analyses over developmental stages, genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding sites, and high-resolution maps of chromatin organization. Both studies identified regions of the nematode and fly genomes that show highly occupied targets (or HOT) regions where DNA was bound by more than 15 of the transcription factors analyzed and the expression of related genes were characterized. Overall, the studies provide insights into the organization, structure, and function of the two genomes and provide basic information needed to guide and correlate both focused and genome-wide studies."
https://openalex.org/W2053526397,"Androgen deprivation therapy is the major treatment for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). However, it is a temporary remission, and the patients almost inevitably develop hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). HRPC is almost incurable, although most HRPC cells still express androgen receptor (AR) and depend on the AR for growth, making AR a prime drug target. Here, we provide evidence that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, is a direct antagonist of androgen action. In silico modeling and FRET-based competition assay showed that EGCG physically interacts with the ligandbinding domain of AR by replacing a high-affinity labeled ligand (IC50 0.4 µM). The functional consequence of this interaction was a decrease in AR-mediated transcriptional activation, which was due to EGCG mediated inhibition of interdomain N-C termini interaction of AR. Treatment with EGCG also repressed the transcriptional activation by a hotspot mutant AR (T877A) expressed ectopically as well as the endogenous AR mutant. As the physiological consequence of AR antagonism, EGCG repressed R1881-induced PCa cell growth. In a xenograft model, EGCG was found to inhibit AR nuclear translocation and protein expression. We also observed a significant down-regulation of androgen-regulated miRNA-21 and up-regulation of a tumor suppressor, miRNA-330, in tumors of mice treated with EGCG. Taken together, we provide evidence that EGCG functionally antagonizes androgen action at multiple levels, resulting in inhibition of PCa growth.—Siddiqui, I. A., Asim, M., Hafeez, B. B., Adhami, V.

The pattern of receptor phosphorylation has been proposed to generate a “bar code” that can be varied in a tissue-specific manner to direct physiologically relevant receptor signaling. If such a mechanism existed, receptors would be expected to be phosphorylated in a cell/tissue-specific manner. Using tryptic phosphopeptide maps, mass spectrometry, and phospho-specific antibodies, it was determined here that the prototypical Gq/11-coupled M3-muscarinic receptor was indeed differentially phosphorylated in various cell and tissue types supporting a role for differential receptor phosphorylation in directing tissue-specific signaling. Furthermore, the phosphorylation profile of the M3-muscarinic receptor was also dependent on the stimulus. Full and partial agonists to the M3-muscarinic receptor were observed to direct phosphorylation preferentially to specific sites. This hitherto unappreciated property of ligands raises the possibility that one mechanism underlying ligand bias/functional selectivity, a process where ligands direct receptors to preferred signaling pathways, may be centered on the capacity of ligands to promote receptor phosphorylation at specific sites.

It is now clear that GPCR phosphorylation is a complex regulatory mechanism involving an array of different protein kinases that include second messenger regulated kinases, members of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family, as well as receptor tyrosine kinases and protein kinase CK2 and CK1α (2Premont R.T.

The consequence of this kinase activity is the hyperphosphorylation of GPCRs at sites largely within the third intracellular loop and C-terminal tail, which in turn promotes the recruitment of arrestin proteins that mediate G-protein-independent signaling (1Reiter E.

G-protein-coupled receptor G-protein-coupled receptor kinase cerebellar granule. The complexity of GPCR phosphorylation allows for the possibility that receptors might be phosphorylated differentially in different cell types (5Torrecilla I. Spragg E.J. Poulin B. McWilliams P.J. Mistry S.C. Blaukat A. Tobin A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and thereby provide a mechanism by which the same receptor subtype would have different signaling properties depending on the cell type in which the receptor is expressed (3Tobin A.B. Butcher A.J. Kong K.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2008; 29: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This notion has been supported by recent studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor and CXC4R receptor where receptor phosphorylation by different members of the GRK family can mediate different signaling outcomes (6Busillo J.M.

Furthermore, our own studies and the studies of others on the M3-muscarinic receptor have demonstrated that phosphorylation of this receptor subtype by CK1α regulates receptor signaling to the phospholipase C and ERK pathways (8Luo J. Busillo J.M. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Budd D.C. Willars G.B. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4581-4587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase CK2 has no impact on ERK/phospholipase C but rather regulates the coupling of the receptor to the JNK pathway (5Torrecilla I. Spragg E.J. Poulin B. McWilliams P.J. Mistry S.C. Blaukat A. Tobin A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that one mechanism by which receptors might direct signaling to one pathway (i.e. JNK) in preference to another (i.e. ERK) might be via specific phosphorylation profiles of the receptor. By adopting a specific phosphorylation profile or “phosphorylation signature,” a receptor could favor coupling to a particular pathway. In this way, the phosphorylation profile of a receptor could act as a “bar code” that encodes a particular signaling outcome (3Tobin A.B. Butcher A.J. Kong K.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2008; 29: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Kim J. Ahn S. Ren X.R. Whalen E.J. Reiter E. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9649-9654Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Hence, in each tissue type a GPCR might adopt a different phosphorylation profile, or bar code, and this would contribute to tissue-specific signaling related to the physiological function of the receptor. If such a regulatory mechanism existed, then it would be expected that receptors would be differentially phosphorylated in different cell types. We test this possibility in this study and present evidence that the M3-muscarinic receptor is indeed differently phosphorylated in different cell and tissue types. Furthermore, we show that ligands can favor specific phosphorylation events that raise the possibility of ligand-specific phosphorylation and thereby a mechanism by which biased ligands could direct the preferential coupling of receptors to downstream signaling networks. Unless otherwise stated, all biochemicals and reagents were from Sigma or from previously identified sources (5Torrecilla I. Spragg E.J. Poulin B. McWilliams P.J. Mistry S.C. Blaukat A. Tobin A.B. J.

Radioisotope [32P]orthophosphate (specific activity 8500–9120 Ci/mmol), myo-[3H]inositol (specific activity 25 Ci/mmol), and N-[3H]methylscopolamine (specific activity 83 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The anti-muscarinic receptor antibodies used in this study were generated in-house against a glutathione S-transferase (GST) bacterial fusion protein containing the full third intracellular loop of the mouse M3-muscarinic receptor (Arg252–Thr491). Where rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised, the antibodies were first passed through a GST-affinity column to remove antibodies to GST and then purified by affinity chromatography on a column containing the receptor-fusion protein. In the case of mouse monoclonal antibodies, affinity purification against the antigen was carried out. Phosphorylation-specific antibodies, anti-phosphoserine 384, 412, and 577, were raised against peptide sequences NSTKLPpSSDNLQ, HKLQAQKpSMDDRD, and YQQRQpSVIFHK, corresponding to amino acid residues 378–389, 405–418, and 572–583 of the mouse M3-muscarinic receptor in which serines 384, 412, and 577 were phosphorylated. The 87-day programs, which included four immunizations, were performed by Eurogentec. The resulting antisera were purified against the immunizing peptides. Mouse M3-muscarinic receptor third intracellular loop Arg252 to Thr491 and the C-terminal Lys548 to Leu589 were inserted into pGEX-2t to produce N-terminal GST fusions. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) IRL transformed with the fusion constructs or pGEX-2t alone was grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1% w/v glucose; protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 200 μm. CHO cells stably expressing the wild-type M3-muscarinic receptor were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and geneticin G418 (500 μg/ml). Experiments were performed in Krebs/HEPES buffer (118 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 4.3 mm KCl, 1.17 MgSO4, 4.17 mm NaHCO3, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 11.7 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) or in a modified Krebs/HEPES buffer as indicated. Mouse CG neurons were prepared and cultured as described previously (5Torrecilla I. Spragg E.J. Poulin B. McWilliams P.J. Mistry S.C. Blaukat A. Tobin A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), trypsin- dissociated, and plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells well. The neurons were maintained in Eagle's basal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm KCl, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FCS. After 48 h, cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to prevent glial cell proliferation, and the culture was continued for 7–8 days. Experiments were then performed on cells that were washed and then maintained in CSS-25 buffer (120 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 25 mm KCl, 15 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)). For the mass spectrometry experiments, a stably transfected CHO cell line was generated that expressed a mouse M3-muscarinic receptor HA-tagged at the C terminus. For receptor purification, 20 confluent T175 flasks were harvested and resuspended in 40 ml of Krebs/HEPES buffer and stimulated with methacholine (100 μm, 5 min). Membranes were then prepared and solubilized by addition of 5 ml of PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 plus a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g, the resulting supernatant was diluted 1:1 with PBS, and the receptor was then purified on anti-HA affinity resin (Roche Diagnostics). After extensive washing with solubilization buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, the resin was resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue. Purified M3-muscarinic receptors were excised from the polyacrylamide and washed three times for 15 min with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Reduction and alkylation of cysteines were performed by addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 60 °C for 30 min followed by addition 100 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min in the dark. Gel slices were washed three times for 5 min with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 50% acetonitrile and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 1 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). LC-MS/MS was carried out on each sample using a 4000 Q-Trap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Peptides resulting from in-gel digestion were loaded at a high flow rate onto a reverse-phase trapping column (0.3 mm inner diameter × 1 mm), containing 5 μm of C18 300 Å Acclaim PepMap media (Dionex, UK) and eluted through a reverse-phase capillary column (75 μm inner diameter × 150 mm) containing Symmetry C18 100 Å media (Waters) that was self-packed using a high pressure packing device (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark). The output from the column was sprayed directly into the nanospray ion source of the 4000 Q-Trap mass spectrometer. Additional mass spectrometry experiments were performed on an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer by “FingerPrints” Proteomics Facility (College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee). The resulting spectra were searched against the UniProtKB/SwissProt data base using MASCOT software (Matrix Science Ltd.) with peptide tolerance set to 5 ppm for LTQ OrbiTrap data or 0.1 Da for 4000 Q-Trap data, and the MS/MS tolerance was set to 0.6 Da. Fixed modifications were set as carbamidomethyl cysteine with variable modifications of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, and oxidized methionine. The enzyme was set to trypsin/P, and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Peptides with a Mascot score greater than 20 and where the probability (p) that the observed match was a random event was <0.05 were included in the analysis. The spectra of peptides reported as being phosphorylated were interrogated manually to confirm the precise sites of phosphorylation. In vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling, receptor solubilization, and immunoprecipitation were conducted as described previously (5Torrecilla I. Spragg E.J. Poulin B. McWilliams P.J. Mistry S.C. Blaukat A. Tobin A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO cells stably expressing the human M3-muscarinic receptor were grown in 6-well plates, washed, and incubated for 1 h in KH2PO4-free Krebs buffer containing 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were then stimulated with 0.1 mm methacholine for 5 min and lysed in RIPA buffer (2 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 160 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4)). M3-muscarinic receptors were immunoprecipitated using an in-house anti-M3-muscarinic receptor polyclonal antibody (5Torrecilla I. Spragg E.J. Poulin B. McWilliams P.J. Mistry S.C. Blaukat A. Tobin A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and visualized by autoradiography. The membrane was subsequently blocked and immunoblotted with another in-house anti-mouse M3-muscarinic receptor monoclonal antibody for the detection of total receptors. To dephosphorylate the immunoprecipitated receptor, the immune complexes were washed three times with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.25% n-octyl glucoside before treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase (20 units per reaction) for 2 h at 37 °C. Receptors were then resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and immunoblotted with phosphorylation-specific antibodies. For phosphopeptide mapping, CHO-M3 cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate. Stimulation and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described above. The immunoprecipitated samples of one entire 6-well plate of CHO cells were pooled and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps were prepared as described previously (5Torrecilla I. Spragg E.J. Poulin B. McWilliams P.J. Mistry S.C. Blaukat A. Tobin A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The resolved phosphopeptides were then visualized using a STORM 820 phosphorimager (GE Healthcare) and quantified using AlphaEaseFC software (Alpha Innotech). To establish the phosphorylation status of M3-muscarinic receptors in preparations from the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and whole pancreas, tissues from adult wild-type or adult M3-muscarinic receptor knock-out mice on a mixed genetic background (129/SvEv × CF1) (25Yamada M. Miyakawa T. Duttaroy A. Yamanaka A. Moriguchi T. Makita R. Ogawa M. Chou C.J. Xia B. Crawley J.N. Felder C.C. Deng C.X. Wess J. Nature. 2001; 410: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) were extracted into ice-cold HIB buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 9.1 mm glucose) containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, PhosStop, Roche Diagnostics). Membranes were prepared and solubilized in buffer composed of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The receptor was immunoprecipitated with the anti-M3-muscarinic receptor monoclonal antibody. Immune complexes were washed three times in solubilization buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Receptors were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphoserine 384, anti-phosphoserine 412, or anti-phosphoserine 577 antibodies. For the detection of total receptors, membranes were stripped and re-probed with an anti-mouse M3 muscarinic receptor antibody. Western blots were digitized and quantified as described above. To assess agonist efficacy, total [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation assay was carried out CHO-m3 cells. In brief, cells seeded at 100,000 cells/well in 24-well plates were labeled with 2.5 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in Krebs/HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated with 10 mm LiCl for 20 min at 37 °C. Appropriate concentrations of agonist were added for 10 min to stimulate [3H]inositol phosphate production. Reactions were terminated by rapid aspiration of the buffer and addition of 1 m ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (500 μl). Cell lysates were transferred to centrifuge tubes and incubated with 10 mm EDTA (50 μl) and 1,1,2-trichlorofluoroethane/tri-n-octylamine (1:1, v/v, 500 μl) for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 4 min. An ∼400-μl aliquot from the top layer was recovered and transferred to fresh tubes containing 60 mm NaHCO3. [3H]Inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphate ([3H]InsPx) fraction was recovered by anion exchange chromatography as follows: Dowex-1 (formate form) columns were regenerated with 10 ml of ammonium formate (2 m), formic acid (0.1 m) and washed thoroughly with distilled water. Samples were applied to the columns, and the columns washed with 10 ml of distilled water. Columns were then washed with ammonium formate (60 mm), sodium tetraborate (10 mm) solution. Total [3H]InsPx was eluted in 10 ml of ammonium formate (0.75 m), formic acid (0.1 m) and collected in large scintillation vials. A 5-ml aliquot from the eluate was mixed with 10 ml of SafeFluor scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. The expression levels of the M3-muscarinic receptor were determined in membranes isolated from the hippocampus, cortex, and submandibular salivary gland by subtracting the specific binding of the muscarinic antagonist N-[3H]methylscopolamine obtained from wild-type mice from that obtained from M3-muscarinic receptor knock-out mice. N-[3H]Methylscopolamine binding was conducted as described previously (13Poulin B. Butcher A. McWilliams P. Bourgognon J.M. Pawlak R. Kong K.C. Bottrill A. Mistry S. Wess J. Rosethorne E.M. Charlton S.J. Tobin A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 9440-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The M3-muscarinic receptor expression levels in hippocampus, cortex, and submandibular gland were 258, 351, and 335 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The submandibular glands from wild-type mice or M3-muscarinic receptor gene knock-out mice were dissected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The fixed tissue were embedded in paraffin and processed on a Shandon Citadel 2000 where serial sections (5 μm) were cut. Sections where dewaxed in xylene, dehydrated through alcohol, and then washed with distilled water. The sections were then treated for microwave antigen retrieval in a Sanyo Shower Wave 1000-watt microwave, at 700 watts for 20 min in a 0.01 m citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Sections were then permeabilized with Triton X-100, and the M3-muscarinic receptor was stained with either anti-M3 muscarinic receptor antibodies or receptor phospho-specific antibodies used at a dilution of 1:200 using methods described previously (5Torrecilla I. Spragg E.J. Poulin B. McWilliams P.J. Mistry S.C. Blaukat A. Tobin A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data presented are means ± S.E. of at least three determinations, and statistically significance differences were determined using analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post test. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. The phosphorylation profile of the mouse M3-muscarinic receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a recombinant protein or as an endogenously expressed protein in the mouse insulinoma cell line, MIN6, and mouse primary CG neurons was investigated. The receptor was immunoprecipitated from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells and digested with trypsin. The tryptic phosphopeptides were then resolved by two-dimensional chromatography, and an autoradiograph was obtained to provide a phosphopeptide map (Fig. 1A). The phosphopeptide map from the three cell types revealed a quartet of phosphopeptides labeled 1–4 that served to orient the map (Fig. 1B). These peptides were seen in all three cell types as were phosphopeptides labeled A and X (Fig. 1B). In contrast, there were a number of phosphopeptides that were observed in only one of the three cell types. Thus, phosphopeptides labeled with three asterisks were only observed in receptors derived from CHO cells (Fig. 1B). Four phosphopeptides labeled with two asterisks were only observed in CG neurons, and the phosphopeptide labeled with two plus signs was only observed in insulinoma cells. There were some phosphopeptides that were shared just between two cell types as illustrated by phosphopeptides Y and B that are shared between CHO cells and CG neurons. These studies demonstrated that although there were common features in the phosphorylation profiles of the M3-muscarinic receptor in the three cell types investigated, there were also specific differences that make the overall phosphorylation profile of the M3-muscarinic receptor expressed in each of the cell types unique. Although the phosphopeptide maps described above illustrate differential receptor phosphorylation, these studies do not reveal the precise sites of phosphorylation. To do this, we conducted a mass spectrometric analysis of the phospho-acceptor sites on the M3-muscarinic receptor expressed in CHO cells. These studies revealed 13 serine and 2 threonine phospho-acceptor sites in the third intracellular loop and one serine (Ser577) in the C-terminal tail (Fig. 2). Phospho-specific antibodies were raised to phosphorylated Ser384 and Ser412 in the third intracellular loop and Ser577 in the C-terminal tail. These were chosen because they represented phosphorylated residues that were not within a cluster of phosphorylation sites (which would have made specific antibody generation difficult) and that were sites determined to have high antigenicity. The antiserum from each of the immunizations was subjected to affinity purification that separated nonphospho-specific antibodies (structural antibodies) and phospho-specific antibodies. To test the specificity of the purified antiserum, the nonphosphorylated epitopes present in bacterial glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing either the third intracellular loop of the receptor or the C-terminal tail were probed in Western blots with the structural antibody and the phospho-specific receptor antibodies (Fig. 3, A–C). In these experiment, the structural antibodies reacted with the appropriate fusion protein. The phospho-specific antibody fraction did not recognize the GST fusion proteins (Fig. 3, B and C). The phospho-specific antibodies did, however, identify the intact M3-muscarinic receptor immunoprecipitated from transfected CHO cells (Fig. 3D). This immunoreactivity was lost following de-phosphorylation with calf intestinal phosphatase (Fig. 3D). The phosphorylation status of the M3-muscarinic receptor at residues 384, 412, and 577 was investigated on receptors expressed in CHO cells, CG neurons, and MIN6 insulinoma cells (Fig. 4). Receptors derived from CHO cells showed high basal levels of phosphorylation on Ser384 that fell by 82% following receptor stimulation with the full agonist methacholine. In contrast, agonist stimulation increased phosphorylation on Ser384 by 28% in receptors expressed in CG neurons (Fig. 4A). In MIN6 cells, the receptor was basally phosphorylated on Ser384 and was not changed following agonist stimulation (Fig. 4B). These data demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser384 was regulated differentially in the three cell types. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of the receptor at Ser577 also showed the importance of cell background. In CHO cells and CG neurons, Ser577 phosphorylation was increased following agonist stimulation by 61 and 50%, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly there was no evidence of basal or agonist-mediated phosphorylation at Ser577 from receptors expressed in MIN6 cells (Fig. 4B). Similarly, there was clear agonist-mediated phosphorylation at Ser412 from receptors derived from CHO cells and CG neurons. However, there was no evidence for Ser412 phosphorylation on receptors expressed in MIN6 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). To evaluate differential phosphorylation of the M3-muscarinic receptor in vivo, membranes were prepared from the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and pancreas from either wild-type mice or from mice where the M3-muscarinic receptor gene had been knocked out. The membranes were then solubilized; the M3-muscarinic receptor was immunoprecipitated with a receptor-specific monoclonal antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was probed in Western blots with receptor phospho-specific antibodies. In these experiments, the M3-muscarinic receptor expressed in the hippocampus was determined to be phosphorylated equally on Ser318 and Ser412 but was phosphorylated to a lesser extent on serine577 (Fig. 5A). The phosphorylation profile for the receptor appeared different in the cerebral cortex where the receptor was equally phosphorylated on Ser318 and Ser577 but less phosphorylated on Ser412 (Fig. 5A). The receptor showed a further unique phosphorylation profile in the pancreas where the receptor was generally poorly phosphorylated, showing a weak signal for phosphorylation on Ser318 and Ser412 but no detectable phosphorylation of Ser577 (Fig. 5A). The molecular weight of the M3-muscarinic receptor immunoprecipitated from the pancreas (Fig. 5A) and from MIN6 insulinoma cells (Fig. 4B) was observed to be greater than that in the brain and CHO cells. The reason for this is likely to be differential glycosylation because the receptor was poorly phosphorylated in pancreatic cell/tissue types; hence, phosphorylation was not likely to be a major contributory factor in the apparently high molecular weight of the receptor in these experiments. We also investigated the phosphorylation status of the M3-muscarinic receptor in salivary submandibular glands. However, we were not able to detect the receptor in Western blots from this tissue probably because the receptor was subjected to proteolysis. We were, however, able to detect the receptor by immunocytochemistry where the M3-muscarinic receptor was determined to be expressed in the excretory cells as well as in the cells of the excretory ducts (Fig. 5B). In these experiments weak staining for the receptor phosphorylated on Ser384 and Ser412 was detected, although there was stronger staining for phosphorylation on Ser577 (Fig. 5B). Hence, the phosphorylation profile of the M3-muscarinic receptor was different in each of the four tissues. This difference is illustrated as a bar code in Fig. 5C. The studies above provide evidence that th"

To date, only two DNA-binding proteins have been identified as being involved in vertebrate tendon formation, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Scleraxis and, recently, the Mohawk homeobox gene. We investigated the involvement of the early growth response transcription factors Egr1 and Egr2 in vertebrate tendon formation. We established that Egr1 and Egr2 expression in tendon cells was correlated with the increase of collagen expression during tendon cell differentiation in embryonic limbs. Vertebrate tendon differentiation relies on a muscle-derived FGF (fibroblast growth factor) signal. FGF4 was able to activate the expression of Egr genes and that of the tendon-associated collagens in chick limbs. Egr gene misexpression experiments using the chick model allowed us to establish that either Egr gene has the ability to induce de novo expression of the reference tendon marker scleraxis, the main tendon collagen Col1a1, and other tendon-associated collagens Col3a1, Col5a1, Col12a1, and Col14a1. Mouse mutants for Egr1 or Egr2 displayed reduced amounts of Col1a1 transcripts and a decrease in the number of collagen fibrils in embryonic tendons. Moreover, EGR1 and EGR2 trans-activated the mouse Col1a1 proximal promoter and were recruited to the tendon regulatory regions of this promoter. These results identify EGRs as novel DNA-binding proteins involved in vertebrate tendon differentiation by regulating type I collagen production.

These results identify EGRs as novel DNA-binding proteins involved in vertebrate tendon differentiation by regulating type I collagen production. Vertebrate tendons are specialized dense connective tissues mainly composed of collagens that connect muscle to bone. Tendon repair following injuries or during aging is a clinical challenge because tendons are only repaired slowly and partially. The establishment of new strategies for tendon repair is prevented by a limited understanding of tendon development and consequently awaits a better understanding of tendon development. An important goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating collagen expression, production, and assembly during tendon development to be able to design new therapies for tendon repair. Tendons consist of elongated fibroblasts named tenocytes that produce an abundant extracellular matrix composed of >90% collagen. The major collagen component of mature tendon is type I collagen, a heterotrimeric molecule composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain that are genetically distinct and encoded by Col1a1 and Col1a2, respectively (1Banos C.C.

Type I collagen molecules self-assemble into highly organized parallel collagen fibrils and then into fibers, which provide the tensile strength of tendon. Other collagens, such as the fibrillar collagens III and V and the nonfibrillar collagens named FACITs (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices), and collagens XII and XIV are important for collagen fibril formation, growth, and integrity of tendons. In addition to collagens, tendons contain various matrix components contributing to the properties of tendons such as proteoglycans, elastic matrix components, and glycoproteins. Most of the available mice deficient for these tendon components display abnormal collagen structure in tendons but also in other tissues (reviewed in Refs. 1Banos C.C. Thomas A.H. Kuo C.K.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into tenocytes are largely unknown. Similarly, the molecules involved in the regulation of collagen genes during embryonic tendon development remain to be identified. It is notable that very few DNA-binding proteins have been identified as being involved in tendon formation. The bHLH transcription factor scleraxis (SCX) is expressed in the tendon progenitor and differentiated cells and has been shown to be involved in embryonic tendon differentiation (7Murchison N.D.

Tendons have the same embryological origin as cartilage and bone in vertebrates. Limb tendons originate from the lateral plate as cartilage and bone. Classical studies in avian embryos and analysis of muscleless limbs from Pax3 mutant mice have highlighted that limb tendons initiate their development independently of muscles, but muscles are required for further tendon development (8Schweitzer R.

Drosophila tendon precursor cells are characterized by the expression of the transcription factor Stripe, an Egr (early growth response)-like transcription factor. Analysis of loss- and gain-of-function Stripe mutant phenotypes shows that Stripe is a key regulator of tendon cell specification and differentiation (20Becker S. Pasca G. Strumpf D. Min L. Volk T.

Cell suspensions were subjected to FACS at room temperature using a MoFlo® XDP Flow Cytometer (Dako; with state laser, 488 nm) with Dako-Moflo Summit software or using a VantageTM Se option DiVa flow cytometer (laser, 488 nm). The GFP-positive fractions were collected in 2 mm PBS-EDTA supplemented with 20% of fetal calf serum. Total RNAs was extracted from FACS-sorted limb tendon cells or from tail tendons of E18.5 mutant and control mice using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity Retrotranscription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primer efficiencies were comprised between 95 and 103%, and for the primers that do not span introns, we performed control PCR minus RT to exclude genomic contamination of the cDNA samples. All primers were used at a concentration of 400 nm. Primer sequences for real-time PCR are listed in Table 1. The results were expressed as mRNA levels corrected for GAPDH levels in each sample. For mRNA level analyses of limb tendon cells, three independent RNA samples originating from three independent mouse litters for each embryonic stage were analyzed at least in triplicate. RNA quantity was extrapolated from the standard curve by the StepOnePlusTM real-time PCR software (Applied Biosystems). For mRNA level analyses in embryonic tail tendons, gene expression changes were quantified using the ΔΔCT method. The experiment was performed with eight independent samples for each genotype, and PCR was carried out in triplicate for each gene.

Schneider-Maunoury S. BioTechniques. 2006; 40 (36, 38 passim): 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Eighty hind limbs from E18.5 mouse embryos were homogenized using a mechanical disruption device (Lysing Matrix A, Fast Prep MP1, 3 × 30 s). 8 μg of each antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-EGR1 antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-EGR2 antibody (Covance, Denver, PA, USA), or anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) as a positive control were used to immunoprecipitate 25 μg of sonicated chromatin. ChIP products were analyzed by PCR. Two pairs of primers were used to amplify fragments associated with tendon regulatory regions of the mouse Col1a1 proximal promoter, previously characterized (11Léjard V. Brideau G. Blais F.

The reverse (5′-aaatgtagcaggtagggcac-3′) and forward (5′-atggcctttactccagacct-3′) primers were used to amplify a 230-base fragment (from −3.08 kb to −2.85 kb) of the Col1a1 promoter, flanking the TSE1 and TSE2 elements (11Léjard V.

The reverse (5′-cgtcaggaaagggtcatctg-3′) and forward (5′-aaaactagctcagggagggc-3′) primers were used to amplify a 330-base fragment (from −1.51 kb to −1.18 kb), included in the tendon-specific deletion region (1.537 kb to −0.22 kb). During vertebrate limb development, tendon cell differentiation is dependent on muscle and occurs in parallel to spatial arrangement of tendon primordia into individual tendons (reviewed in Ref. 4Edom-Vovard F. Duprez D. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The muscle-dependent phase of tendon formation has been established to initiate after E12.5 and E6 in mouse and chick limbs, respectively, based on the presence of Scx expression in E12.5 mouse and E6 chick muscleless limbs and its subsequent disappearance after these stages (8Schweitzer R.

Before tendon differentiation and individualization, the main tendon collagen, Col1a1 was expressed ubiquitously in chick limb tissues (Fig. 1A), whereas the reference tendon marker Scx displayed an expression in dorsal and ventral limb regions (Fig. 1B). It is assumed that Scx early expression in dorsal and ventral limb regions labels tendon progenitors (7Murchison N.D. Price B.A. Conner D.A. Keene D.R. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J. Schweitzer R. Development. 2007; 134: 2697-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 8Schweitzer R. Chyung J.H. Murtaugh L.C. Brent A.E. Rosen V. Olson E.N. Lassar A. Tabin C.J.

Development. 2009; 136: 1351-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). When tendons are well individualized, Col1a1 expression is clearly enhanced in chick and mouse tendons, in addition to be expressed in other limb tissues such as muscle connective tissue cells, blood vessels, and dermis (Fig. 1, C, D, and G). Tendon-associated collagens, for example as Col5a1 and Col12a1, also label chick or mouse limb tendons (Fig. 1, E, F, H, and I). To analyze the expression levels of collagens and Egr genes specifically in tendon cells before and after the initiation of tendon differentiation process, we had to sort out tendon cells. We took advantage of the Scx-GFP mouse line (28Pryce B.A. Brent A.E. Murchison N.D. Tabin C.J. Schweitzer R. Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236: 1677-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We isolated GFP-positive cells by FACS from limbs of Scx-GFP mouse line at different embryonic stages: E11.5 (tendon progenitors), E12.5 (transitory stage), and E14.5 (differentiating tendon cells) (Fig. 1J). Quantitative analysis of Col1a1 expression showed a dramatic 27-fold increase between E11.5 (progenitors) and E14.5 (tenocytes) (Fig. 1K), although a significant 2.7-fold increase of Col1a1 transcript levels was observed between E11.5 and E12.5 and a much greater increase of 10-fold increase occurred between E12.5 and E14.5 (Fig. 1K). This suggested that the initiation of Col1a1 increase was initiated between E11.5 and E12.5. The tendon-associated collagens, Col3a1, Col5a1, Col12a1, and Col14a1, followed similar expression patterns. They all displayed a massive increase of expression between E11.5 and E14.5 ranging from 7-fold for Col3a1 to 91-fold for Col14a1, and smaller but significant increases between E11.5 and E12.5 (Fig. 1K). This quantitative analysis of collagen expression in mouse limb tendon cells showed that tendon collagen expression increases dramatically between E11.5 and E14.5. The timing of the collagen expression increase is fully consistent with the timing of the muscle-dependent phase of tendon cell differentiation. Quantitative analysis of Egr1 and Egr2 expression in tendon cells showed that Egr1 and Egr2 expression significantly increased between the stage of tendon progenitors (E11.5) and the stage of differentiating tendon cells (E14.5), 15-fold for Egr1 and 10-fold for Egr2 (Fig. 2A). These results indicated that Egr1 and Egr2 expression level followed that of collagens during tendon cell differentiation (Fig. 1, J and K, and 2A). In situ hybridization experiments confirmed that mEgr1 transcripts were first observed at E12.5 in Scx domains in forming tendons (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). At E16.5, when tendons are fully individualized, mEgr1 transcripts display a restricted expression at the tendon attachment close to muscles (Fig. 2, B and C) (41McMahon A.P. Champion J.E. McMahon J.A. Sukhatme V.P. Development. 1990; 108: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and delineate long tendons (Fig. 2, D and E). The mouse Egr2 probe failed to provide any significant signal in mouse limbs in our hands. We therefore analyzed Egr2 expression in Egr2lacZ/+ mice (30Schneider-Maunoury S. Topilko P. Seitandou T.

https://openalex.org/W2059637124,"Autophagy has recently elicited significant attention as a mechanism that either protects or promotes cell death, although different autophagy pathways, and the cellular context in which they occur, remain to be elucidated. We report a thorough cellular and biochemical characterization of a novel selective autophagy that works as a protective cell response. This new selective autophagy is activated in pancreatic acinar cells during pancreatitis-induced vesicular transport alteration to sequester and degrade potentially deleterious activated zymogen granules. We have coined the term ""zymophagy"" to refer to this process. The autophagy-related protein VMP1, the ubiquitin-protease USP9x, and the ubiquitin-binding protein p62 mediate zymophagy. Moreover, VMP1 interacts with USP9x, indicating that there is a close cooperation between the autophagy pathway and the ubiquitin recognition machinery required for selective autophagosome formation. Zymophagy is activated by experimental pancreatitis in genetically engineered mice and cultured pancreatic acinar cells and by acute pancreatitis in humans. Furthermore, zymophagy has pathophysiological relevance by controlling pancreatitis-induced intracellular zymogen activation and helping to prevent cell death. Together, these data reveal a novel selective form of autophagy mediated by the VMP1-USP9x-p62 pathway, as a cellular protective response."

Mice with an inactive S1P lyase gene are impaired in the capacity to degrade S1P, resulting in highly elevated S1P levels. These S1P lyase-deficient mice have low numbers of lymphocytes and high numbers of neutrophils in their blood. We found that the S1P lyase-deficient mice exhibited features of an inflammatory response including elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increased expression of genes in liver associated with an acute-phase response. However, the recruitment of their neutrophils into inflamed tissues was impaired and their neutrophils were defective in migration to chemotactic stimulus. The IL-23/IL-17/granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) cytokine-controlled loop regulating neutrophil homeostasis, which is dependent on neutrophil trafficking to tissues, was disturbed in S1P lyase-deficient mice. Deletion of the S1P4 receptor partially decreased the neutrophilia and inflammation in S1P lyase-deficient mice, implicating S1P receptor signaling in the phenotype.

After its formation, S1P may be either dephosphorylated back to sphingosine by the action of two specific S1P phosphatases, Sgpp1 and Sgpp2, or permanently degraded by the S1P lyase Sgpl1 to the nonsphingolipid substrates hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine (7Fyrst H.

Total bone marrow cells were isolated from Sgpl1+/+ and Sgpl1−/− mice by flushing the femur and tibia from both legs two times with 1 ml of PBS. Cells were injected i.v. into lethally irradiated Rag2−/− mice (Taconic, Germantown, NY). Transplanted mice were analyzed 8 weeks after the procedure. Sgpl1+/+, and Sgpl1−/− mice were injected intraperitoneal with 10 mg/kg of body weight of LPS from Escherichia coli 055:B5 (Sigma-Aldrich) and observed for 5 days. In other experiments, mice were euthanized 60, 90, and 120 min after LPS injection. Sgpl1+/+ and Sgpl1−/− mice were injected intraperitoneal with 300 μl of 4% thioglycollate (Sigma-Aldrich).

Total bone marrow cells were isolated from mice by flushing the femur and tibia from both legs two times with 1 ml of PBS. To obtain total leukocytes, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were dissected and mechanically disaggregated. Single-cell suspensions were obtained using a 40-μm cell strainer. Peripheral blood was obtained by cardiac puncture. Red blood cells were removed from blood samples and splenic single-cell suspensions by ammonium chloride lysis. For some experiments, neutrophils were sorted from total bone marrow cells using anti-Ly-6G magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). The absolute number of each cell subpopulation was determined by flow cytometry using CALTAG counting beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For bone marrow and spleen, the absolute cell counts were normalized by the individual body weight expressed in grams. Alternatively, blood cell counts were determined in the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. Tissues from Sgpl1+/+ and Sgpl1−/− mice were fixed and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with H&E. A comprehensive histologic evaluation of the sections was performed by the National Institutes of Health Division of Veterinary Resources Pathology Service. Cells were diluted in 1% BSA-PBS and incubated with anti-FcγR antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) to block binding of conjugated antibodies to FcγR (BD Biosciences). Antibodies anti-mouse Gr-1 (FITC- and allophycocyanin [APC]-conjugated), anti-CD11b (phycoerythrin (PE)- and FITC-conjugated), anti-CD4 (peridinin chlorophyll protein [PerCP]-conjugated), anti-CD8 (PE-conjugated), anti-B220 (APC-conjugated), anti-CD62L (APC-conjugated), anti-CD11a (PE-conjugated), anti-CD49d (PE-conjugated), anti-CD18 (FITC-conjugated), anti-IL-17 (PE-conjugated), and anti-Foxp3 (FITC-conjugated) were purchased from BD Biosciences. After cells were labeled with the appropriate antibodies for 30 min on ice and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, they were subjected to flow cytometry on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Myeloid cells in bone marrow were identified as Gr-1high CD11b+ and Gr-1low CD11b+. Neutrophils in blood and spleen were identified as Gr-1high CD11b+ cells and monocytes as Gr-1low/− CD11b+ cells. T lymphocytes were identified as CD4+ or CD8+ cells and B lymphocytes as B220+ cells. Th-17 cells were detected by determining the intracellular production of IL-17 in CD4+ cells. Lymphocytes were isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes, activated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 500 ng/ml ionomycin for 2 h and incubated with BD GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) for 2 h. Cells were then stained with anti-CD4 PerCP-conjugated antibody on ice for 30 min, fixed, and permeabilized using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences), and stained with IL-17 PE-conjugated and Foxp3 FITC-conjugated antibodies. Th-17 cells were identified as CD4+ IL-17+ Foxp3− cells. For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, mice were injected intraperitoneally once with 100 μl of a 10 mg/ml BrdU solution (BD Biosciences) and analyzed 48 h later. BrdU-positive cells were detected using a FITC-BrdU Flow kit (BD Biosciences) by flow cytometry. Serum levels of corticosterone were determined by ELISA (AssayPro, St. Charles, MO). Serum levels of cytokines IL-12, TNF, IFN-g, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, IL-10, and IL-6 were determined using the BD Cytometric Bead Array (CBA, BD Biosciences). Serum IL-17 was detected by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Serum granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was detected using the mouse cytokine/chemokine LINCOplex kit from Millipore (St. Charles, MO). IL-23 expression was studied by determining the levels of the Il23a subunit mRNA by real-time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as described below. The concentration of shed, soluble CD62L (s-CD62L) in serum from Sgpl1+/+ and Sgpl1−/− mice was determined by ELISA (R&D Systems). The response of neutrophils toward formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was studied using 6.5 mm Transwell inserts with a 5-μm pore size (Corning, Cambridge, MA). A splenocyte suspension in RPMI 1640 plus 0.4 mg/ml fatty acid-free (FAF)-BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) (medium + FAF-BSA) was added to each insert in a well containing 600 μl of a solution of 1 μm fMLP (SigmaAldrich) prepared in medium + FAF-BSA. Wells containing medium + FAF-BSA without fMLP were used as controls. After 3 h at 37 °C, cells in the bottom of the wells were harvested, counted, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For RT-qPCR, total RNA was purified from bone marrow neutrophils and from liver using TRIZOL (Invitrogen). The mRNA expression levels of mouse Tnf (Mm00443258_m1), Vcam-1 (Mm00449197_m1), Saa1 (Mm00656927_g1), Saa3 (Mm00441203_m1), Sell (Mm00441291_m1), Il23a (Mm00518984_m1), S1pr1 (Mm00514644_m1), S1pr2 (Mm01177794), S1pr3 (Mm00515669_m1), S1pr4 (Mm00468695_s1), and S1pr5 (Mm00474763_m1) genes were determined by RT-qPCR using Assay-on-Demand probes and primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Mm99999915_g1) mRNA level was used as an internal control. For microarray analysis, RNA purified from Sgpl1+/+ and Sgpl1−/− livers was prepared and analyzed on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays as described (29Bektas M. Allende M.L. Lee B.G.

The National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus accession number for the microarray data is GSE18745. Genes that belong to the Gene Ontology (GO) category “acute inflammation” were compared between Sgpl1+/+ and Sgpl1−/− mRNA samples using a heat map generated using the Partek Genomic Suite 6.5 software (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO). Sphingolipids in serum were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) by the Lipidomics Core at the Medical University of South Carolina on a Thermo Finnigan (Waltham, MA) TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a multiple reaction monitoring-positive ionization mode as described (32Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods. 2006; 39: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was determined using the Mann-Whitney or Student's t test. In all cases, values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Sgpl1−/− mice generally die soon after weaning (26Vogel P. Donoviel M.S. Read R. Hansen G.M. Hazlewood J. Anderson S.J.

The Sgpl1−/− mice were severely lymphopenic, with deficiencies of both T (CD4+, CD8+) cells and B (B220+) cells in blood (supplemental Fig. S1, A and C). Low numbers of T and B cells were also apparent in the spleen of the Sgpl1−/− mice (supplemental Fig. S1, B and D). The lymphocyte deficiency in the Sgpl1−/− mice has been attributed to a number of possible sources, including a block in the egress of recirculating lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs and to defects in the development of T cells and B cells (27Weber C. Krueger A. Münk A. Bode C. Van Veldhoven P.P. Gräler M.H. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast to the severe lymphopenia, blood levels of neutrophils, and monocytes were highly elevated in the Sgpl1−/− mice (Fig. 1A) (26Vogel P. Donoviel M.S. Read R. Hansen G.M. Hazlewood J. Anderson S.J. Sun W. Swaffield J. Oravecz T. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Sgpl1+/− mice had normal blood cell counts indicating that both Sgpl1 alleles must to be deleted to produce this immune phenotype (supplemental Fig. S2A). We next determined the numbers and percentages of neutrophils and monocytes in the spleen and their precursors in the bone marrow. Compared with the WT mice, the percentages of splenic neutrophils and monocytes were dramatically elevated in Sgpl1−/− compared with WT mice (Fig. 1C). The total numbers of neutrophils and monocytes in spleen, when normalized by body weight, were also significantly increased in the Sgpl1−/− mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 1D). We enumerated myeloid cells, the precursors of neutrophils and monocytes, in bone marrow and found a substantial increase of both immature and mature myeloid cells in the Sgpl1−/− mice when expressed as either percentage of total cells or absolute cell numbers normalized by body weight (Fig. 1, E and F). The ratio of immature to mature myeloid cells was similar between Sgpl1−/− and WT mice suggesting differentiation of neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow of Sgpl1−/− mice was normal. To establish whether increased granulopoiesis was responsible for the elevated neutrophil numbers in Sgpl1−/− mice, we labeled proliferating precursor cells in bone marrow by BrdU incorporation and determined the appearance of BrdU+ neutrophils in blood after 48 h. The numbers of BrdU+ neutrophils generated in Sgpl1−/− mice were significantly higher than in WT mice (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that increased granulopoiesis was occurring in the Sgpl1−/− mice. We also determined the circulating ceramide, sphingosine, and S1P levels at P6 and P18 by HPLC-MS/MS analysis (supplemental Fig. S3). Both ceramide and S1P levels were substantially elevated at P6 and P18 in the Sgpl1−/− mice compared with WT mice. With increasing age, ceramide and S1P levels increased in the Sgpl1−/− mice. Sphingosine remained at similar low levels at both ages tested. Sgpl1+/− mice had serum sphingolipid levels similar to WT mice (supplemental Fig. S2B). To rule out stress-induced changes on peripheral lymphocytes and neutrophils, we measured circulating corticosterone levels and found that there was no significant difference between the values of Sgpl1−/− and WT mice (supplemental Fig. S4). Neutrophilia can be associated with inflammation. Microarray analysis of P18 liver mRNA using Affymetrix mouse genome GeneChips revealed that the GO category of “acute inflammation” was significantly different between Sgpl1−/− and WT mice (p < 0.001). Acute-phase reactants, serum amyloids (Saa1–4), orosomucoids (Orm1–3), and LPS binding protein (Lbp) were highly elevated in the livers of the Sgpl1−/− mice compared with those of WT mice, indicative of an acute inflammatory process (Fig. 2A). We next determined the progression of inflammatory changes in Sgpl1−/− mice by examining the mRNA expression of some genes related to inflammation in liver at P6 and P18. An increase in Tnf, Saa1, and Saa3 was detected by RT-qPCR at both ages in the Sgpl1−/− livers compared with those of WT mice (Fig. 2B). We also detected an increase in the expression level of the endothelial adhesion molecule Vcam-1 in the P18 Sgpl1−/− livers when compared with controls (Fig. 2B). Vcam-1 is elevated during the endothelium response to inflammatory stimuli (33Barreiro O. Martín P. González-Amaro R. Sánchez-Madrid F. Cardiovasc. Res. 2010; 86: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate the presence of a pro-inflammatory process in the liver of Sgpl1−/− mice that intensifies with age. In the serum of Sgpl1−/− mice, we detected a significant increase in the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IFN-γ, MCP-1, and IL-6 compared with levels observed in WT mice (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that the inflammation was systemic. Sgpl1+/− mice did not display any elevated serum cytokine levels (supplemental Fig. S2C). Injection of Sgpl1−/− mice with a dose of LPS, which was not lethal to WT mice, caused their death by 8 h (supplemental Fig. S5A). Within 120 min after the LPS injection, the Sgpl1−/− mice expressed substantially higher levels of TNF, IL-6, and MCP-1 in serum compared with the WT mice injected with LPS (supplemental Fig. S5B). Serum ceramide, sphingosine, and S1P concentrations were not significantly elevated over the respective baseline values in either Sgpl1−/− or control mice after LPS treatment during the same time period (supplemental Fig. S5C). The pro-inflammatory state of the Sgpl1−/− mice raised the possibility that stimulation of the innate immune system by opportunistic bacterial infection, perhaps as a result of their severe lymphocyte deficiency, might be inducing systemic inflammation. We found no histologic evidence for the presence of infection in the tissue of Sgpl1−/− mice compared with WT mice (supplemental Fig. S6). We therefore studied the effect of deleting the Toll-like receptor-4 (Tlr4) in Sgpl1−/− mice (Fig. 3). Tlr4 is a receptor that detects the LPS of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, and triggers a cascade of events that activates the transcription of many pro-inflammatory genes involved in the innate immune response (34Beutler B.A. Blood. 2009; 113: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). If the inflammatory response in Sgpl1−/− mice was the result of a Gram-negative bacterial infection, the inflammation in the Sgpl1−/− Tlr4−/− double knock-out (DKO) mice should be suppressed relative to the Sgpl1−/− mice. We found that the Sgpl1−/− Tlr4−/− DKO and Sgpl1−/− mice had similarly depressed lymphocyte and elevated neutrophil blood counts (Fig. 3A) and similar elevations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum (Fig. 3B) and of mRNA levels for Tnf and Vcam-1 in liver (Fig. 3C). Whereas the Sgpl1−/− mice were hypersensitive to LPS, dying by 8 h after being challenged with a nonlethal dose of LPS, the Sgpl1−/− Tlr4−/− DKO mice were resistant (supplemental Fig. S5A). These results indicate that the pro-inflammatory condition of the Sgpl1−/− mice was unlikely to be the result of an activation of the innate immune system by an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterial infection. We next sought to determine if the neutrophilia was correlated with large numbers of neutrophils infiltrating into the liver of Sgpl1−/− mice, as would be expected based on the acute inflammation exhibited by this tissue (Fig. 2, A and B). Surprisingly, we found that the liver parenchyma in Sgpl1−/− mice appeared similar to Sgpl1+/+ mice and did not exhibit extensive neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 4, A and B); however, we did observe abnormally high accumulations of neutrophils that appeared to be confined at the hepatic sinusoids in Sgpl1−/− mice compared with Sgpl1+/+ mice (Fig. 4, C and D). These results suggested a possible impairment of neutrophil recruitment from the blood into the inflamed tissue in the Sgpl1−/− mice. A survey of other Sgpl1−/− tissues showed that they were spared from substantial neutrophil infiltration (supplemental Fig. S6, C–L). As reported previously (26Vogel P. Donoviel M.S. Read R. Hansen G.M. Hazlewood J. Anderson S.J. Sun W. Swaffield J. Oravecz T. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the Spgl1−/− lungs contained a slight increase in macrophages within alveoli (supplemental Fig. S6, A and B). To establish whether Sgpl1 deficiency altered the ability of neutrophils to migrate to sites of inflammation, we injected mice intraperitoneal with thioglycollate and examined the influx of neutrophils into"
https://openalex.org/W1992867100,"Accumulating evidence indicates that dysfunction of mitochondria is a common feature of Parkinson disease. Functional loss of a familial Parkinson disease-linked gene, BRPK/PINK1 (PINK1), results in deterioration of mitochondrial functions and eventual neuronal cell death. A mitochondrial chaperone protein has been shown to be a substrate of PINK1 kinase activity. In this study, we demonstrated that PINK1 has another action point in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was enhanced by overexpression of PINK1, and the Akt activation was crucial for protection of SH-SY5Y cells from various cytotoxic agents, including oxidative stress. Enhanced Akt phosphorylation was not due to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase but due to activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) by PINK1. Rictor, a specific component of mTORC2, was phosphorylated by overexpression of PINK1. Furthermore, overexpression of PINK1 enhanced cell motility. These results indicate that PINK1 exerts its cytoprotective function not only in mitochondria but also in the cytoplasm through activation of mTORC2."
https://openalex.org/W1987133102,"Accumulation of the amyloid β peptide in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain is a major pathological feature of Alzheimer disease. Amyloid β peptide is generated from the sequential protease cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We reported previously that copper increases the level of APP at the cell surface. Here we report that copper, but not iron or zinc, promotes APP trafficking in cultured polarized epithelial cells and neuronal cells. In SH-SY5Y neuronal cells and primary cortical neurons, copper promoted a redistribution of APP from a perinuclear localization to a wider distribution, including neurites. Importantly, a change in APP localization was not attributed to an up-regulation of APP protein synthesis. Using live cell imaging and endocytosis assays, we found that copper promotes an increase in cell surface APP by increasing its exocytosis and reducing its endocytosis, respectively. This study identifies a novel mechanism by which copper regulates the localization and presumably the function of APP, which is of major significance for understanding the role of APP in copper homeostasis and the role of copper in Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2002960747,"A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) tether protein kinase A (PKA) and other signaling proteins to defined intracellular sites, thereby establishing compartmentalized cAMP signaling. AKAP-PKA interactions play key roles in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cardiac myocyte contractility. We discovered small molecules, 3,3'-diamino-4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane (FMP-API-1) and its derivatives, which inhibit AKAP-PKA interactions in vitro and in cultured cardiac myocytes. The molecules bind to an allosteric site of regulatory subunits of PKA identifying a hitherto unrecognized region that controls AKAP-PKA interactions. FMP-API-1 also activates PKA. The net effect of FMP-API-1 is a selective interference with compartmentalized cAMP signaling. In cardiac myocytes, FMP-API-1 reveals a novel mechanism involved in terminating β-adrenoreceptor-induced cAMP synthesis. In addition, FMP-API-1 leads to an increase in contractility of cultured rat cardiac myocytes and intact hearts. Thus, FMP-API-1 represents not only a novel means to study compartmentalized cAMP/PKA signaling but, due to its effects on cardiac myocytes and intact hearts, provides the basis for a new concept in the treatment of chronic heart failure."

Mutations in each of the three RNase H2 subunits have been implicated in a human auto-inflammatory disorder, Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS). To understand how mutations impact on RNase H2 function we determined the crystal structure of the human heterotrimer. In doing so, we correct several key regions of the previously reported murine RNase H2 atomic model and provide biochemical validation for our structural model. Our results provide new insights into how the subunits are arranged to form an enzymatically active complex. In particular, we establish that the RNASEH2A C terminus is a eukaryotic adaptation for binding the two accessory subunits, with residues within it required for enzymatic activity. This C-terminal extension interacts with the RNASEH2C C terminus and both are necessary to form a stable, enzymatically active heterotrimer. Disease mutations cluster at this interface between all three subunits, destabilizing the complex and/or impairing enzyme activity. Altogether, we locate 25 out of 29 residues mutated in AGS patients, establishing a firm basis for future investigations into disease pathogenesis and function of the RNase H2 enzyme.

Eukaryotic RNase H2 has evolved markedly from its prokaryotic ancestry. In both archaea and bacteria, the RNase H2 enzyme consists of a single protein, while eukaryotic RNase H2 is a complex containing three protein subunits, all of which are required for activity (5Jeong H.S.

The RNASEH2A subunit exhibits significant sequence homology, including the catalytic site residues, with the prokaryotic enzyme, whereas the two auxiliary subunits (RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C) have no known prokaryotic equivalents. The precise role of the auxiliary subunits is not fully defined; however they are thought to serve as a platform for assembly of the RNase H2 complex and to modulate its interaction with other proteins. Indeed, RNASEH2B binds PCNA (7Chon H. Vassilev A. DePamphilis M. Zhao Y. Zhang J. Burgers P.M. Crouch R.J. Cerritelli S.M.

Despite a high degree of sequence identity between the mouse and human subunits, the authors only located three patient mutations in their structure, stating that the remaining mutations were in disordered loops. We therefore determined the structure of the human RNase H2 trimer to enhance our understanding of how RNase H2 mutations cause disease.

In addition, we define a more extensive interaction interface for the C terminus of RNASEH2A that involves both auxiliary subunits.

Our human structure now allows the mapping of 25 out of 29 AGS mutations, and shows that 7 of these cluster at the interface of the RNASEH2A and RNASEH2C C-terminal regions. A polycistronic construct based on pGEX6P1 was made to express the human RNase H2 trimer, allowing simultaneous expression of GST-tagged RNASEH2B, and untagged RNASEH2A and RNASEH2C (supplemental Fig. S1A). Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences were introduced by PCR before RNASEH2A and RNASEH2C coding sequences. Similar polycistronic constructs were used for all co-expression, with RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, or RNASEH2C replaced by alternative coding sequences. Point mutations and internal deletions were introduced using the QuikChange method (Stratagene); C-terminal deletions were created with alternative reverse primers; chimeric Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Afu)/human RNASEH2A was generated by overlap PCR. For a list of constructs generated, see supplemental Table S1. Recombinant RNase H2 complexes were expressed in Rosetta-2 cells (Novagen). Cells were grown to an optical density of 0.6 at 37 °C, cooled to room temperature, and induced with 0.1 mm IPTG at 20 °C for 14–16 h. Cells were pelleted and lysed by sonication in a PBS buffer containing 0.2% Tween, 10 mm MgCl2, Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma, 50 μl per gram of cell pellet), 100 μg of DNase I and 100 μg of RNase A (Sigma). Cleared lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare Life Science) for 2 h at 16 °C. GST-tagged and associated proteins were released from the beads by cleavage with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) for 14–16 h at 4 °C and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7. As human RNaseH2 containing full-length subunits did not yield crystals of sufficient quality, we improved x-ray diffraction by truncating regions of predicted disorder and introducing point mutations. Our best diffraction data were obtained from crystals of a complex containing RNASEH2B residues 2–226, full-length RNASEH2C, and RNASEH2A with catalytic site mutations D34A and D169A. Importantly, this complex (without the point mutations) retains the same activity as wild-type RNase H2 (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at room temperature in 96-well plates with 0.2 μl droplets at 4 °C. Equal volumes of pre-formed RNaseH2 complex (11 mg/ml in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7) and precipitant (20% PEG3350, 0.1 m bis-Tris-propane pH 6.5, 0.2 m KNO3) were mixed. Crystals were cryoprotected with reservoir solution plus 20% ethylene glycol before cryocooling in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at Diamond Light Source (Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, UK) at beamline I04. The data set was integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. Academic Press, New York1997Google Scholar). Pseudo-translational symmetry was detected from a native Patterson map, and as a result MOLREP was used for the molecular replacement strategy (17Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar). Coordinates deposited for the murine RNase H2 (PDB ID: 3KIO) were initially used as a search model for phasing, however limited refinement into the human electron density resulted in poor geometry and statistics (supplemental Table S2). The deposited murine structure was re-refined against deposited structure factors with BUSTER-TNT (18Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), using non-crystallographic local structure similarity restraints (19.Smart, O., Brandl, M., Flensburg, C., Keller, P., Paciorek, W., Vonrhein, C., Womack, T., Bricogne, G., (2008) Annual Meeting of the ACA, 137, Knoxville, TN.Google Scholar) and TLS constraints (where each chain corresponded to a TLS group; supplemental Table S3). As murine RNase H2 (PDB ID: 3KIO) was solved by experimental phasing using selenomethionine derivates (14Shaban N.M. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3617-3624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we preserved the location but not necessarily the sequence context of these methionines, including those introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (14Shaban N.M. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3617-3624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The re-refined murine RNase H2 coordinates were then used as a molecular replacement model for the human structure. To generate a human homology model as a starting point for refinement, point mutations were introduced using COOT into the murine coordinates. Atomic models for the subunits were refined against the 4.1 Å human dataset as individual rigid bodies with PHENIX (20Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16447) Google Scholar), followed by further cycles of maximum-likelihood positional and B-factor refinement with BUSTER-TNT (18Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) using TLS and 2-fold NCS restraints. The use of non-crystallographic local structure similarity restraints (19.Smart, O., Brandl, M., Flensburg, C., Keller, P., Paciorek, W., Vonrhein, C., Womack, T., Bricogne, G., (2008) Annual Meeting of the ACA, 137, Knoxville, TN.Google Scholar) plus strict stereochemical (18Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and B-factor (21Tronrud D.E. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1996; 29: 100-104Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar) restraints were coupled with highly conservative rebuilding to avoid over-fitting of the experimental data. Because of steric clashes, RNASEH2A:143–166 were excluded from the refinement in one of the two heterotrimers. The analysis and figures presented were generated from the heterotrimer best-resolved in electron density.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant complexes with one subunit GST-tagged were expressed using polycistronic constructs and purified by affinity chromatography (see above). Affinity-matrix-bound proteins before and after PreScision Protease cleavage were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Enzyme activity assays were performed using a fluorometric assay as previously described (9Crow Y. Leitch A. Hayward B. Garner A. Parmar R. Griffith E. Ali M. Semple C. Aicardi J. Babul-Hirji R.

Briefly, 10 μm of 3′ fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides (GATCTGAGCCTGGGaGCT or gatctgagcctgggagct; uppercase DNA, lowercase RNA) were annealed to a complementary 5′ DABCYL-labeled DNA oligonucleotide (Eurogentec) in 60 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, by heating for 5 min at 95 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Reactions were performed in 100 μl of buffer (60 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.01% BSA, 0.01% Triton X-100) with 250 nm substrate in 96-well flat-bottomed plates at 24 ± 2 °C for 90 min. Fluorescence was read for 100 ms using a VICTOR2 1420 multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer), with a 480 nm excitation filter and a 535 nm emission filter. Reactions were carried out in triplicate with a range of different protein concentrations. A standard curve (relating fluorescence units to moles of converted substrate) was generated using fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide annealed to DNA without DABCYL. Experiments were performed using the fluorometric assay and conditions described above, with 0.1 nm RNase H2 and substrate concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 μm for RNA18:DNA18 substrate or from 0 to 0.5 μm for D14R1D3:D18 substrate. Initial velocities of substrate cleavage were determined and expressed as the rate of the converted substrate concentration (nm) over time (min). Substrate hydrolysis by RNase H2 follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were determined using non-linear regression in SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software Inc.). Thermal stability assays were performed using the fluorescence-based thermal shift (ThermoFluor) method as previously described (22Nettleship J.E. Brown J. Groves M.R. Geerlof A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 426: 299-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Proteins were diluted in 50 μl volumes to 2 μm in 10 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.2, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 5× SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen). Assays were carried out in a Bio-Rad iQ5 rtPCR Thermocycler, heating the samples from 20 °C to 80 °C at 0.5 °C increments, holding each temperature for 30 s. Fluorescence intensity was measured in relative fluorescence units (RFU) using excitation/emission wavelengths of 485 nm/575 nm. Thermal denaturation graphs were plotted as a function of the gradient of protein unfolding [d(RFU)/dT] against the temperature gradient, with the melting temperature (Tm) defined as the temperature at the maximum of d(RFU)/dT. Peptides were generated by automatic synthesis (23Winkler D.F. Hilpert K. Brandt O. Hancock R.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 570: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Dikmans A. Beutling U. Schmeisser E. Thiele S. Frank R. Qsar Combinatorial Science. 2006; 25: 1069-1080Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) on chemically modified cellulose membrane disks derivatized with Fmoc-β-alanine using standard Fmoc (fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry with the MultiPep (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments AG) (23Winkler D.F. Hilpert K. Brandt O. Hancock R.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 570: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). After synthesis, side chains were deprotected by incubating the disks in 80% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 3% triisopropylsilane (TIPS), 5% H2O, 12% dichloromethane for 1 h at room temperature. This solution was removed and the membrane disks were solubilized in 88.5% TFA, 4% trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, 2.5% TIPS, 5% H2O for 16 h at room temperature. Peptide-cellulose conjugates were precipitated with ice-cold tert-butylmethylether, dried, and dissolved in DMSO. Peptide arrays were created by spotting the peptide-cellulose conjugates on coated microscope slides (CelluSpotsTM, Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments AG) in duplicate. Slides were blocked in TBST (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) containing 5% BSA and then overlaid with TBST/0.5% BSA containing 0.4 μm recombinant His-RNASEH2BC. Control slides were overlaid with TBST/0.5% BSA only. Bound protein was detected with anti-His-HRP (Qiagen) and visualized by ECL (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Peptide binding experiments were performed at 20 °C in a Perkin Elmer LS55 Luminescence Spectrometer with excitation/emission wavelengths of 480 nm/530 nm and slit widths of 15 nm/20 nm, respectively. The photomultiplier voltage used was 650 V with an integration time of 5 s per measurement. A peptide corresponding to the C terminus of RNASEH2A with an N-terminal fluorescein plus a single glycine linker ([Fluorescein] GSSHRYFLERGLESATSL; Peptide Protein Research) was rehydrated in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8 and diluted in a 900 μl volume to a final concentration of 20 nm. The RNASEH2BC heterodimer (54.4 μm) was titrated into a constantly stirred cuvette containing the fluorescein-labeled peptide. Anisotropy was measured continuously, and the values recorded once measurements were unchanged for five consecutive readings. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting the titration data (corrected for dilution) to a one-site binding equilibrium model in Prism5 (GraphPad Software). To gain insight into how mutations in RNase H2 cause human disease, we set out to solve the structure of the human RNase H2 heterotrimer. Given significant sequence conservation between human and murine RNase H2 (86, 80, and 65% sequence identity for RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C, respectively) the murine RNase H2 crystal structure (PDB ID: 3KIO) (14Shaban N.M. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3617-3624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used as a model for molecular replacement to phase human RNase H2. However, limited refinement of this solution into the human RNase H2 electron density failed to give adequate statistics or geometry (supplemental Table S2). Re-analysis of the coordinates and structure factors deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for murine RNase H2 established that the published mouse model was not in agreement with the experimental electron density in a number of areas (mRNASEH2C residues 87–116 and 136–144; mRNASEH2B residues 92–102, 146–159, and 267–282; supplemental Fig. S2 and S3) (26Kleywegt G.J. Harris M.R. Zou J.Y. Taylor T.C. Wählby A. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2240-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We therefore used BUSTER-TNT to re-refine the deposited murine coordinates against the deposited structure factors. Our new interpretation of the murine model improved the refinement statistics (supplemental Table S3) and produced a better visual fit to the density (supplemental Fig. S3). The two murine models are similar in their secondary structural elements but differ significantly in their connectivity and sequence assignment for all three RNase H2 subunits (see supplemental Fig. S3 and S4, and supplemental text for a detailed description of the differences observed). We then solved the structure of human RNase H2 to 4.1 Å resolution by molecular replacement using coordinates for this re-refined murine model. To avoid overfitting of the data, the human model was refined using tight geometric and B-factor restraints (21Tronrud D.E. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1996; 29: 100-104Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar) resulting in refinement residuals Rexpt and Rfree of 37.4 and 37.9%, respectively. The geometry of the final refinement was assessed using MOLPROBITY (27Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W375-W383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). 94.1% of the residues were in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot; 0.5% were outliers. As expected from the sequence conservation between murine and human RNase H2, we find their structures to be similar. Superposition of atomic models based on secondary structure matching (28Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3150) Google Scholar) resulted in a root mean square deviation of 1.01 Å for equivalent Cα atom pairs. The largest difference was found at (human) RNASEH2A residues 195–204. However, due to the low resolution of our human structure, this new conformation was not modeled and the α-helix was truncated at residue 194. Human RNase H2 is a heterotrimeric complex in which the core domains of the three subunits are linearly stacked (Fig. 1A). The structure of the RNase H2 catalytic subunit is highly conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (14Shaban N.M. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3617-3624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Chapados B.R. Chai Q. Hosfield D.J. Qiu J. Shen B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, we find that the core domain of human RNASEH2A adopts a canonical RNase H2 fold. In eukaryotes, the sequence of RNASEH2A extends beyond the catalytic core domain to include nearly 50 additional residues. Whereas residues 258–283 are not resolved in our human RNase H2 structure, the extreme C terminus of RNASEH2A (residues 284–299) forms an α/β motif that binds the RNASEH2BC heterodimer, and RNASEH2A residues 250–257 contribute to a β-sheet with RNASEH2C. The auxiliary RNASEH2B and RNASH2C subunits together with the C-terminal extension of RNASEH2A adopt an interwoven triple β-barrel fold centered on the C-terminal half of RNASEH2C. RNASEH2C residues 118–126 and 128–134 form β-strands central to all three β-barrels, whereas residues 143–160 form a kinked α-helix that interacts with secondary structure elements of RNASEH2B and the C terminus of RNASEH2A. Analysis of the electrostatic surface potential of RNase H2 reveals two positively charged patches on the same face of the molecule (Fig. 1B). The first region corresponds to the active site binding groove of the catalytic RNASEH2A subunit and is similar to that observed for Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Afu) RNase HII (15Chapados B.R. Chai Q. Hosfield D.J. Qiu J. Shen B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The second basic patch occurs in the vicinity of the central β-barrel formed by the RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C subunits, and may indicate an additional substrate binding site. In the crystal structure of human RNase H2 the C terminus of RNASEH2A extends from the core catalytic domain and bridges the two auxiliary subunits (Fig. 2A). To assess the functional relevance of this interaction, we examined the effect of mutant and chimeric RNASEH2A on complex assembly and enzyme activity. GST-tagged RNASEH2B was used to co-purify complexes by affinity chromatography. When co-expressed, wild-type RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C subunits assemble to"

https://openalex.org/W1977473390,"PHLPP belongs to a novel family of protein phosphatases that serve as negative regulators of Akt. There are two isoforms, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, identified in this family. Our previous studies indicated a tumor suppressor role of both PHLPP isoforms in colon cancer. Here we report that the expression of PHLPP is controlled by mTOR-dependent protein translation in colon and breast cancer cells. Treating cells with rapamycin or knockdown of mTOR using RNAi results in a marked decrease of PHLPP protein expression. In contrast, stable knockdown of TSC2, a negative regulator of mTOR activity, increases PHLPP expression. The rapamycin-mediated down-regulation of PHLPP is blocked by expression of a rapamycin-insensitive mutant of p70S6K. In addition, depletion of 4E-BP1 expression by RNAi results in an increase of PHLPP expression and resistance to rapamycin-induced down-regulation. Moreover, inhibition of mTOR activity by amino acid or glucose starvation reduces PHLPP expression in cells. Functionally, we show that rapamycin-mediated inhibition of PHLPP expression contributes to rapamycin resistance in colon cancer cells. Thus, our studies identify a compensatory feedback regulation in which the activation of Akt is inhibited by up-regulation of PHLPP through mTOR, and this mTOR-dependent expression of PHLPP subsequently determines the rapamycin sensitivity of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981943245,"Factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH) catalyzes the β-hydroxylation of an asparagine residue in the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), a modification that negatively regulates HIF transcriptional activity. FIH also catalyzes the hydroxylation of highly conserved Asn residues within the ubiquitous ankyrin repeat domain (ARD)-containing proteins. Hydroxylation has been shown to stabilize localized regions of the ARD fold in the case of a three-repeat consensus ankyrin protein, but this phenomenon has not been demonstrated for the extensive naturally occurring ARDs. Here we report that the cytoskeletal ankyrin family are substrates for FIH-catalyzed hydroxylations. We show that the ARD of ankyrinR is multiply hydroxylated by FIH both in vitro and in endogenous proteins purified from human and mouse erythrocytes. Hydroxylation of the D34 region of ankyrinR ARD (ankyrin repeats 13–24) increases its conformational stability and leads to a reduction in its interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (CDB3), demonstrating the potential for FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation to modulate protein-protein interactions. Unexpectedly we found that aspartate residues in ankyrinR and ankyrinB are hydroxylated and that FIH-catalyzed aspartate hydroxylation also occurs in other naturally occurring AR sequences. The crystal structure of an FIH variant in complex with an Asp-substrate peptide together with NMR analyses of the hydroxylation product identifies the 3S regio- and stereoselectivity of the FIH-catalyzed Asp hydroxylation, revealing a previously unprecedented posttranslational modification.

FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation of an asparagine (Asn) residue in the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (CAD) of human HIF-α reduces the interaction between HIF and the transcriptional coactivator proteins p300/CBP (2Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), thereby reducing the expression of HIF-regulated genes. The dependence of FIH on oxygen for catalysis enables it to act as a sensor for hypoxia (3Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J.

FIH not only catalyzes the β-hydroxylation of Asn residues in HIF-α isoforms but also of ankyrin repeat domain (ARD)-containing proteins (5Cockman M.E. Lancaster D.E. Stolze I.P. Hewitson K.S.

In contrast to its “switch-like” role in HIF regulation, the role(s) of Asn hydroxylation of the ubiquitous ARD proteins is unknown; it has been proposed that the extent of ARD hydroxylation regulates the amount of FIH available for HIF hydroxylation (6Coleman M.L. McDonough M.A. Hewitson K.S. Coles C. Mecinovic J. Edelmann M. Cook K.M. Cockman M.E. Lancaster D.E. Kessler B.M. Oldham N.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. J. Biol.

The ankyrin repeat domain comprises a variable number of ∼33 residue ankyrin repeats (ARs) that are arranged into a helix-loop-helix-β-hairpin/loop conformation (11Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). ARDs are predicted to be present in >300 proteins encoded by the human genome (12Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar) and are involved in a range of processes including signaling, development, epigenetic regulation, and cellular structure (13Michaely P.

Trans-Prolyl-4 hydroxylation of the extracellular matrix protein collagen occurs extensively in (Pro-Pro-Gly)n motifs and stabilizes the collagen triple helix structure (15Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 16Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Crystallization studies on ARD proteins have shown that Asn hydroxylation does not alter the stereotypical ankyrin fold (6Coleman M.L. McDonough M.A. Hewitson K.S. Coles C. Mecinovic J. Edelmann M. Cook K.M. Cockman M.E. Lancaster D.E. Kessler B.M. Oldham N.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. J. Biol.

Biosyst. 2009; 5: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, solution studies have revealed that Asn hydroxylation stabilizes consensus ARD proteins with respect to unfolding (17Kelly L. McDonough M.A. Coleman M.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. Mol. Biosyst. 2009; 5: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Hardy A.P. Prokes I. Kelly L. Campbell I.D. Schofield C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 994-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The question then arises as to whether ARD proteins that have a structural role in cells undergo Asn hydroxylation. The human cytoskeletal ankyrin family, which serve as adapters linking a variety of integral membrane proteins to the spectrin-cytoskeleton, includes three members: ankyrinR, ankyrinB, and ankyrinG (19Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). All three ankyrins contain 24 ARs in their membrane binding domains. Here we show that peptide fragments derived from ankyrinR, ankyrinB, and ankyrinG are substrates for FIH. We demonstrate that the ankyrinR ARD undergoes multiple FIH-catalyzed Asn hydroxylations both in vitro and in vivo. Hydroxylation of ankyrinR D34 causes its stabilization and may modulate its interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (CDB3). Unexpectedly, we found that FIH catalyzes the aspartate (Asp) hydroxylation of ankyrinR and ankyrinB. Using biochemical assays, NMR, and crystallographic analyses, we show that FIH also hydroxylates Asp residues in other AR sequences to generate the novel 2S,3S-hydroxyaspartate product. Taken together the results expand the scope of FIH-catalyzed post-translational modifications. pGEX-KG D34 (ankyrinR aa 402–827, ARs 13–24) was a kind gift from P. Michaely (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). pGEX-6p1-ankyrinB (ankyrinB aa 1–959, ARs 1–24) was a generous gift from V. Bennett (Duke University). pEF1/V5-HIS D34 was generated by PCR using pGEX-KG D34 as the template. pEF1/V5-HIS D12 (ankyrinR aa 1–402, ARs 1–12) was generated by PCR using human fetal cDNA as template. pFLAG-CMV2 CDB3 (aa 2–379) was generated by PCR using pET-21a CDB3 (kind gift from Z. Zhang, Fudan University) as the template. pET28a FIH, pCDNA3 FIH, and pCDNA3 FIH D201A plasmids were as described previously (6Coleman M.L. McDonough M.A. Hewitson K.S. Coles C. Mecinovic J. Edelmann M. Cook K.M. Cockman M.E. Lancaster D.E. Kessler B.M. Oldham N.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24027-24038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The FIH Q239H mutant was generated by standard techniques. The integrity of all constructs was verified by sequencing. Peptides used for in vitro incubation assays with FIH were prepared using an Intavis Multipep automated peptide synthesizer using Tentagel-S-RAM resin (Rapp-Polymere) using standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl/N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole strategy. Final cleavage using 2.5% triisopropylsilane in trifluoroacetic acid yielded the peptides as C-terminal amides that were precipitated in cold ether, re-dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and lyophilized. The masses of the predicted peptide products were confirmed using a Micromass MALDI-TOF (Waters) mass spectrometer. AnkyrinR D34 and the ankyrinB ARD were prepared by glutathione affinity and size exclusion chromatography to >90% purity using buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaBr, 2.5 mm CaCl2 (Buffer A). D34-OH was prepared by co-expression of pGEX-KG D34 and pET-28a FIH in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). After induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, the cells were supplemented with a final concentration of 40 μm Fe(II), 1.6 mm 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), and 1.2 mm 5,6-isopropylidene-l-ascorbic acid (IPAA) and were grown for 4 h before harvest. The cells were lysed by sonication in Buffer A supplemented with 40 μm Fe(II), 5 mm 2OG, and 1.2 mm IPAA and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with stirring. Purification of D34-OH was as for the unhydroxylated material. CDB3 was prepared as described (20Ding Y. Jiang W. Su Y. Zhou H. Zhang Z. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 34: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recombinant D34 was tested for the ability to stimulate FIH-dependent decarboxylation of 14C-labeled 2OG as described (3Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J. Bhattacharya S. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26351-26355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In vitro FIH incubation assay used 20–60 μm FIH, 100 μm Fe(II), 100 μm peptidyl substrate, 1 mm 2OG, and 1.2 mm IPAA. The assay mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before analyses. HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2mm l-glutamine. Transfection was with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were lysed in IP buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, 1×Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and V5-D34 affinity purified using anti-V5 antibody resin (Sigma). Immunocomplexes were washed 3 times in IP buffer before elution in 2× Laemmli buffer and separation by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed using the following HRP-conjugated antibodies at a dilution of 1:5000: anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-V5 (AbD Serotec), and anti-FLAG (Sigma). GST pulldown assays were performed as described (21Su Y. Ding Y. Jiang M. Jiang W. Hu X. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 289: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Human blood samples used in this study were provided by a healthy laboratory donor following written informed consent with ethical approval from the Mid and South Buckinghamshire Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 08/H0607/50). Endogenous ankyrinR was essentially purified from 50 ml of freshly drawn human blood as described (22Bennett V. Stenbuck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2540-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE gel bands corresponding to the correct size of ankyrinR were excised and subjected to trypsin or endoproteinase GluC digestion followed by MS analyses. Mouse endogenous ankyrinR was purified following the same protocol except that 5 ml of blood was isolated from four mice by cardiac puncture. Coomassie Blue-stained protein-containing bands were excised and digested with either trypsin (Promega) or endoproteinase GluC (Roche Applied Science) essentially as described (8Cockman M.E. Webb J.D. Kramer H.B. Kessler B.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 535-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The resultant digest mixtures were analyzed by nano-ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoUPLC-MS/MS) using a 75-μm inner diameter, 25-cm length C18 nano-AcquityTM UPLCTM column (1.7 μm particle size; Waters) and a 90-min gradient of 2–45% solvent B (solvent A: 99.9% H2O, 0.1% formic acid; solvent B: 99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) on a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system (final flow rate 250 nl/min; 6000–7000 p.s.i.) coupled to a Q-TOF (quadrupole time-of-flight) Premier tandem mass spectrometer (Waters). MS analyses were performed in data-directed analysis mode (MS to MS/MS switching at precursor ion counts greater than 10 and MS/MS collision energy dependent on precursor ion mass and charge state). Raw MS data were processed with ProteinLynx Global Server software (PLGS Version 2.2.5) including de-isotoping. The mass accuracy of the raw data was calibrated using Glu-fibrinopeptide (200 fmol/μl; 700 nl/min flow rate; 785.8426 Da [M+2H]2+) that was infused into the mass spectrometer as a lock mass during sample analysis. MS and MS/MS data were calibrated at intervals of 30 s. For the identification of endogenous ankyrinR, data-directed analysis-derived MS/MS spectra (peaklists) were searched against the UniprotKB/Swissprot data base (release 2010_07, 2010/06/18, 20,355 human sequences and 16,299 mouse sequences) using the Mascot algorithm (Version 2.2, Matrix Science) on an in-house server (The Computational Biology Research Group, University of Oxford) with the following parameters: peptide tolerance, 0.2 Da; 13C = 1; fragment tolerance, 0.1 Da; trypsin missed cleavages, 1; instrument type, electrospray ionization-quadrupole-TOF; variable modifications: M/N/D/HW oxidation, N/Q deamidation, no fixed modifications. The minimum threshold score/expect cut-off for accepting an individual MS/MS spectrum was >45/0.013, which assured the presence of at least 6–8 consecutive b or y ions covering the post-translationally modified residue. Assignments of hydroxylations that were detected by PLGS and Mascot were evaluated and verified by manual inspection. For quantitative comparison of non-hydroxylated versus hydroxylated peptide peaks, the sum of all MS spectra containing the relevant precursor ion pairs are shown, and the ratio was calculated by comparing the sum of ion counts for all isotopic peaks of the corresponding precursor ions. MALDI-TOF MS analyses of synthetic peptides were performed on a Waters MicromassTM MALDI micro MXTM mass spectrometer in positive ion reflectron mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the MALDI matrix. Instrument parameters used were: laser energy, 141%; pulse, 2050 V; detector, 2700V; suppression, 1500. The MALDI data were analyzed using MassLynxTM Version 4.1. MS/MS analyses of synthetic peptides was performed on a SynaptTM high definition mass spectrometryTM (Micromass Ltd) using a 2.1 × 100-mm C18 Acquity UPLC® BEH300 column (1.7-μm particle size; Waters) and a 4-min gradient of 5–50% solvent B at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. LC/MS was performed at trap CE 6V and transfer CE 4V, and MS/MS was performed at trap CE 35V and transfer CE 4V. CD experiments were performed using a Chirascan Circular Dichroism Spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. The temperature inside the cuvette was recorded during the scan and used in the subsequent analyses. A cuvette with a path length 0.1 cm was used. For thermally induced unfolding, D34 samples were buffered in 1 mm Tris, 400 mm NaF, pH 7.4, at a protein concentration of 2.5 μm. Thermal denaturation used stepped ramping at a rate of 1 °C min−1, and the signal was averaged over 3 scans at each temperature. For equilibrium unfolding, aliquots of urea solutions were prepared by dispensing the appropriate volumes of 10 m urea solution in buffer (1 mm Tris, 400 mm NaF, pH 7.4). Protein stock was then added to a final concentration of 2 μm. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 16 h before measurement. For native proteins (at 0 m urea), at least three spectra between 200 and 250 nm were recorded and averaged to determine whether the spectrum had the expected shape. At all other urea concentrations, the ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded, and three points were averaged. The denaturation curves were fitted to a three-state model described previously (23Werbeck N.D. Itzhaki L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7863-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using SigmaPlot. DSC scans were collected using a MicroCal VP DSC Microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at a protein concentration of 20 μm in Buffer A at a scan rate of 1 °C min−1. The Asp-substrate peptide HLEVVKLLLEHGADVDAQDK was hydroxylated (∼75%) by incubation with FIH in the presence of 2OG, Fe(II), and IPAA at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (2%). Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the hydroxylated product was purified by HPLC using a Vydac 218TP C18 reversed phase column (250 × 22 mm; particle size, 10–15 μm) (Grace Davison Discovery Sciences). The hydroxylated peptide was eluted using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then lyophilized. To prepare the peptide for NMR analysis the sample was resuspended in 160 μl of methanol-d4 and transferred to a 3-mm NMR tube. All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on a Bruker AVIII 700 spectrometer equipped with an inverse TCI cryoprobe optimized for 1H observation and running TOPSPIN 2 software. HSQC spectra were collected using adiabatic 180° CHIRP pulses, and TOCSY experiments employed the DIPSI-2 isotropic mixing scheme with mixing times of 120 ms. Spectra are referenced to residual methanol solvent signals at δH 3.33 and δC 48.0 ppm. The SMART, PFAM, and Uniprot databases were searched for human ankyrin sequences. Sequences that were represented incompletely in the electronic resources were extended to the canonical length of 33 residues. To eliminate redundancy, AR matching to different entries for identical proteins was removed. Among the 1505 human AR sequences identified, 1354 ARs have a length of 32, 33, or 34 residues and were selected for the alignment. The FIH Q239H variant was prepared by standard methodology and purified as described for wt FIH (3Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J.

Co-crystallization of FIH Q239H with the Asp-substrate peptide 2, HLEVVKLLLEHGADVDAQDK (purchased from PeptideSynthetics), used conditions reported for the FIH·HIF1αCAD complex (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). A dataset for an FIH Q239H·Zn(II) NOG·Peptide 2 crystal was collected at the Diamond beamline I02 with an ADSC Q315 3 × 3 CCD detector and was processed with HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (search model PDB ID 1H2K) and was initially refined with CNS (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar) and slow cool-simulated annealing refinement using the maximum-likelihood function and bulk-solvent modeling in CNS proceeded until the decreasing R/Rfree no longer converged. PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to monitor the geometric quality of the model between refinement cycles and identify poorly modeled areas needing attention. The final model was refined with a round of REFMAC TLS using the anisotropic thermal motion parameters derived from TLS motion determination server (28Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). 90.4% of the residues in the final model lie within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran [ϕ,ψ] plot and the rest within the additionally allowed regions. For data collection and refinement statistics, see supplemental Table S1. The coordinates for the structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2xum. Sequence analyses of the 24 ARs of human ankyrinR identified 13 Asn residues at positions analogous to previously demonstrated sites of FIH-dependent hydroxylations (5Cockman M.E. Lancaster D.E.

To investigate which of these ARs contain Asn residues that are FIH substrates, we synthesized peptides spanning the potential hydroxylation sites and tested them in FIH incubation assays. Peptides corresponding to ARs 3, 4, 7, 14, 19, and 22 of the ankyrinR ARD displayed an increase of 16 Da in mass to varying extents after incubation with FIH (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). MS/MS analyses of the modified peptides assigned the sites of hydroxylation to Asn residues corresponding to Asn-105, Asn-233, Asn-464, Asn-629, and Asn-728 in ankyrinR ARD (supplemental Figs. S2–S6). We next examined the sequences of the other human cytoskeletal proteins, ankyrinB and ankyrinG, and found several Asn residues located at analogous hydroxylation positions to ankyrinR (supplemental Figs. S7A and S8A). Synthetic peptides spanning ankyrinB Asn-58, Asn-124, Asn-656, and Asn-755 and ankyrinG Asn-68, Asn-134, Asn-658, Asn-691, and Asn-757 were all found to be hydroxylated by FIH (supplemental Figs. S7B and S8B). The observations suggested that the human cytoskeletal ankyrins are potential FIH substrates. To assess whether the residues hydroxylated in the peptide studies above could also be hydroxylated in the context of an ARD, we first purified recombinant human ARDs from Escherichia coli. We were successful in isolating the C-terminal 12 ARs of ankyrinR (residues 402–827; D34) (29Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2092077288,"In view of its critical role in influenza A virus (IAV) tropism and pathogenesis, we evaluated the receptor binding properties of HA proteins of the closely related swine and new pandemic human IAVs. We generated recombinant soluble trimeric H1 ectodomains of several IAVs and analyzed their sialic acid binding properties using fetuin-binding and glycan array analysis. The results show that closely related swine and new pandemic H1 proteins differ dramatically in their ability to bind these receptors. Although new pandemic H1 protein exhibited hardly any binding, swine H1 bound efficiently to a number of α2-6-linked sialyl glycans. The responsible amino acids were identified by analyzing chimeric H1 proteins and by performing systematic site-directed mutagenesis of swine and new pandemic human H1 proteins. The difference was found to map to residues at positions 200 and 227. Although substitution of either residue significantly affected the binding phenotype, substitution of both was found to act synergistically and reverse the phenotype almost completely. Modeling of the T200A and E227A substitutions into the crystal structure of the new pandemic human H1 protein revealed the loss of potential hydrogen bond formation with Gln(191), which is part of the 190-loop of the receptor binding site, and with the penultimate galactose, respectively. Thus, a residue not belonging to the receptor binding site may affect the interaction of HA with its receptor. Interestingly, whereas alanine at position 200 is found in most new pandemic human viruses, the residue at position 227 in these viruses is invariably a glutamic acid."

N-cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule essential for synaptic contact and is involved in the intracellular signaling pathway at the synapse. Here we report that the functional disruption of N-cadherin-mediated cell contact activated p38 MAPK in murine primary neurons, followed by neuronal death. We further observed that treatment with Aβ42 decreased cellular N-cadherin expression through NMDA receptors accompanied by increased phosphorylation of both p38 MAPK and Tau in murine primary neurons. Moreover, expression levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK were negatively correlated with that of N-cadherin in human brains. Proteomic analysis of human brains identified a novel interaction between N-cadherin and JNK-associated leucine zipper protein (JLP), a scaffolding protein involved in the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. We demonstrated that N-cadherin expression had an inhibitory effect on JLP-mediated p38 MAPK signal activation by decreasing the interaction between JLP and p38 MAPK in COS7 cells. Also, this study demonstrated a novel physical and functional association between N-cadherin and p38 MAPK and suggested neuroprotective roles of cadherin-based synaptic contact.

Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid β; JLP, JNK-associated leucine zipper protein; PS, presenilin; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ANOVA, analysis of variance. is pathologically characterized by the presence of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex and hippocampus. Insoluble Aβ fibrillar aggregates found in senile plaques have long been considered to cause the neurodegeneration of AD. On the other hand, synaptic loss is another pathological hallmark of AD, which strongly correlates with the severity of cognitive impairment better than senile plaques or neurofibrillary tangles (1Terry R.D. Masliah E. Salmon D.P. Butters N. DeTeresa R. Hill R. Hansen L.A. Katzman R. Ann. Neurol. 1991; 30: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3355) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies from AD mouse models have shown that learning impairment and synaptic dysfunction become apparent before the formation of plaques, suggesting the hypothesis that soluble Aβ causes “synaptic failure” before plaques develop and neuron death occurs (2Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). Converging lines of evidence suggest that natural soluble Aβ oligomers trigger synaptic loss (3Shankar G.M. Bloodgood B.L. Townsend M. Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Sabatini B.L. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2866-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the investigation of molecular mechanisms, which develop senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, research focusing on synaptic dysfunction is important to clarify the earliest pathology in AD. Presenilin (PS) 1/2 is the essential catalytic component of γ-secretase proteolytic complex (4Wolfe M.S. De Los Angeles J. Miller D.D. Xia W. Selkoe D.J.

Invest. 1999; 104: 1321-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PS1 binds to N-cadherin, which is an essential molecule for synaptic contact and is abundantly localized in hippocampal synapses (9Benson D.L. Tanaka H. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6892-6904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of cadherin associates with the actin cytoskeleton via β-catenin and regulates synaptic contact, synaptogenesis, and dendritic spine morphology (10Murase S. Mosser E. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 91-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 11Togashi H. Abe K. Mizoguchi A. Takaoka K. Chisaka O. Takeichi M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition to the structural role as an adhesive molecule, N-cadherin plays important roles in intracellular signaling pathways such as β-catenin or Wnt signaling. Also, N-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion activates PI3K/Akt cell survival signaling by recruiting PI3K into the N-cadherin adhesion complex (12Tran N.L. Adams D.G. Vaillancourt R.R. Heimark R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32905-32914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Further, PS1 facilitates this process by promoting cadherin/PI3K association (13Baki L. Shioi J. Wen P. Shao Z. Schwarzman A. Gama-Sosa M. Neve R. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). As a consequence, PS1/N-cadherin interaction at the synapse seems to be neuroprotective by facilitating the PI3K/Akt survival signaling. Recently, we demonstrated that N-cadherin promotes the cell surface expression of PS1/γ-secretase, thereby activating the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway (14Uemura K. Kuzuya A. Shimozono Y. Aoyagi N. Ando K. Shimohama S. Kinoshita A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15823-15832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and that N-cadherin-mediated synaptic adhesion modulates Aβ secretion as well as Aβ42/40 ratio via PS1/N-cadherin interactions (15Uemura K. Lill C.M. Banks M. Asada M. Aoyagi N. Ando K. Kubota M. Kihara T. Nishimoto T. Sugimoto H. Takahashi R. Hyman B.T. Shimohama S. Berezovska O. Kinoshita A. J Neurochem. 2009; 108: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that N-cadherin functions not only as a synaptic adhesion molecule but also as a modulator of AD pathology by affecting Aβ production and PI3K/Akt signaling. On the other hand, increased p38 MAPK activity is associated with the neuropathology of AD (16Johnson G.V. Bailey C.D. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 183: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For example, both p38 MAPK and its upstream kinase MKK6 are activated in AD brain tissue as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (17Hensley K. Floyd R.A. Zheng N.Y. Nael R. Robinson K.A. Nguyen X. Pye Q.N. Stewart C.A. Geddes J. Markesbery W.R. Patel E. Johnson G.V. Bing G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 18Zhu X. Rottkamp C.A. Hartzler A. Sun Z. Takeda A. Boux H. Shimohama S. Perry G. Smith M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Activation of the p38 MAPK signaling is also reported in an AD-relevant animal model (19Savage M.J. Lin Y.G. Ciallella J.R. Flood D.G. Scott R.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a previous report demonstrated that Aβ employs synaptic depression to drive endocytosis of synaptic AMPA receptor by activating p38 MAPK (20Hsieh H. Boehm J. Sato C. Iwatsubo T. Tomita T. Sisodia S. Malinow R. Neuron. 2006; 52: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Among the MAPK family members, p38 MAPK is activated by numerous unique signals such as environmental stressors and toxins, cellular injury, growth factors, and inflammatory cytokine leading to various neuronal cell fates including apoptosis, differentiation, and proliferation. However, the relationship between p38 MAPK and N-cadherin has not been elucidated in AD pathology. Based on the above observations, we hypothesized that disruption of N-cadherin-based cell-cell contact may up-regulate the p38 MAPK signaling, leading to the neurodegeneration of AD. We demonstrated an inverse correlation between the expression levels of phosphorylated (and thus activated) p38 MAPK and those of N-cadherin in human brains. Moreover, we showed that the disruption of N-cadherin-based contact leads to an activation of p38 MAPK signaling in murine primary neurons, followed by neuronal death. Furthermore, we performed proteomic analysis using human brains and identified JNK-associated leucine zipper protein (JLP) as a novel interacting protein of N-cadherin, thus demonstrating a new signaling pathway from N-cadherin to p38 MAPK through the association with JLP, which might be compromised in AD pathogenesis. Human brain tissues were provided by the Tokyo Institute of Psychiatry. Brains from non-AD and AD patients were dissolved in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Each sample was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected to obtain soluble proteins. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. For proteomic analysis, equal amounts of aliquots were treated with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C. After removing protein G-Sepharose by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, anti-N-cadherin antibody (BD Biosciences) was added to the supernatants. Each sample was rotated for 2 h at 4 °C and then treated with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer five times and resuspended in 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4.3% SDS, 30% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). After boiling for 4 min, the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. To visualize proteins, the gels were stained with silver nitrate using PlusOne silver staining kit protein (GE Healthcare). The protein bands were excised and subjected to in gel trypsinization, and molecular mass analysis of the tryptic peptides was performed by MALDI-TOF/MS with an Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/TOF system (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). HEK293 and COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. SH-SY5Y cells, which are derived from human neuroblastoma cell lines, were maintained in Opti-MEM® (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS. Primary neurons were obtained from the cerebral cortices of fetal mice (14–16 days of gestation) and cultured in neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen).

Transfection of either HEK293 or COS7 cells was carried out using Transfectin reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following antibodies were used in the study: mouse monoclonal antibody to N-cadherin (BD Biosciences), rabbit polyclonal antibody to JLP (Abcam), rabbit polyclonal antibody to p38 and phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal antibody to S-probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-N-cadherin N terminus antibody (N-cadherin neutralizing antibody, GC-4), anti-β-actin antibody, anti-FLAG-M2 antibody, control normal mouse IgG (Sigma), mouse monoclonal antibody to PHF-Tau (AT8) (Pierce), and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate (Molecular Probe). ADH-1 was a kind gift from Dr. Gupta (Adherex Technologies Inc.). Synthetic Aβ42 peptides were obtained from Peptide Institute Inc. SB203580 was purchased from Calbiochem. S-protein-agarose beads were from Novagen. Preparation of protein samples, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described elsewhere (14Uemura K. Kuzuya A. Shimozono Y. Aoyagi N.

For inhibition of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact, the cells were treated either with ADH-1 as indicated or with N-cadherin-neutralizing antibody (GC-4) as described elsewhere (15Uemura K. Lill C.M. Banks M. Asada M. Aoyagi N. Ando K. Kubota M. Kihara T. Nishimoto T. Sugimoto H. Takahashi R. Hyman B.T. Shimohama S. Berezovska O. Kinoshita A.

After fixation, the samples were examined using a laser scanning confocal microscope, LSM 510 META (Zeiss). Signals on films were quantified with National Institutes of Health Image software (National Institutes of Health). Comparisons were performed using a Mann-Whitney U test or a Student's t test. For comparison of multiparametric analysis, one-way ANOVA, followed by the post hoc analysis by Fisher's protected least significant difference (PLSD) was used. Pearson's correlation co-efficients and significance were defined by STATVIEW software. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E., and statistical significance was assessed at p < 0.05. N-cadherin is an essential adhesion molecule for forming synapses, and synaptic loss is one of pathological hallmarks of AD. Because previous reports showed that synaptic proteins such as synaptophysin or PSD-95 were reduced in AD (24Masliah E. Terry R.D. DeTeresa R.M. Hansen L.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 103: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 25Gylys K.H. Fein J.A. Yang F. Wiley D.J. Miller C.A. Cole G.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 1809-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that N-cadherin expression is also decreased in the brains of AD patients. First, the expression levels of N-cadherin were analyzed in human brain tissues from temporal cortices of AD patients and age-matched non-AD controls (Table 1). As expected, Western blot analysis using anti-N-cadherin antibody showed that expression levels of N-cadherin were decreased in AD brains compared with non-AD controls (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis showed that the ratio of N-cadherin/β-actin was significantly decreased in AD brains compared with that in non-AD controls (Fig. 1B, p < 0.05). To investigate whether the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was enhanced in AD brains, we subsequently examined the expression levels of both phosphorylated and total p38 MAPK in the same tissues of human brains by Western blot (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous reports (18Zhu X. Rottkamp C.A. Hartzler A. Sun Z. Takeda A. Boux H. Shimohama S. Perry G. Smith M.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Savage M.J. Lin Y.G. Ciallella J.R. Flood D.G. Scott R.W. J.

Moreover, when we plotted the ratio of phospho/total p38 MAPK against that of N-cadherin/β-actin, we found that the phospho/total p38 MAPK ratio negatively correlated with N-cadherin/β-actin ratio (Fig. 1D, r = −0.774, p < 0.01). These results suggested a negative correlation between phosphorylated p38 MAPK and N-cadherin expressions in human brain.TABLE 1Characteristics of human casesCaseAgeSexPost-mortem intervalClinical diagnosisPathological findingsyearshNon-ADCase 160MaleNAAlcoholismPlaque(−), NFT stage ICase 280FemaleNAAbdominal aortic aneurysm rupturePlaque(−), NFT stage IICase 377Male7.5Liver cirrhosisPlaque(−), NFT stage IICase 466Male11Rectal cancerPlaque(−), NFT stage ICase 548Male10Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcificationPlaque(−), tangle(−)ADCase 175Male12Alzheimer diseaseBraak stage C, VICase 268Female9Alzheimer diseaseBraak stage C, VICase 375Male17.5Alzheimer diseaseBraak stage C, VICase 481Female61Dementia with Levy bodiesAlzheimer disease Braak stage C, VICase 556Male18Alzheimer diseaseBraak stage C, VI Open table in a new tab To elucidate the link between the reduced level of N-cadherin and p38 MAPK activation in AD brains, we analyzed whether the inhibition of N-cadherin-based synaptic contact could lead to p38 MAPK activation in neuronal cells. The N-terminal extracellular domain of N-cadherin harbors the homophilic cell adhesion recognition sequence, His-Ala-Val (HAV). It has been established that ADH-1, which mimics the natural HAV sequence of N-cadherin, can specifically disrupt N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion (26Williams E. Williams G. Gour B.J. Blaschuk O.W. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4007-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used it as a specific N-cadherin antagonist in the present experiment. First, murine primary neurons were treated with different concentrations of ADH-1 to disrupt the N-cadherin-based synaptic contact, followed by analysis of p38 MAPK activation by Western blot. Interestingly, exposure of murine primary neurons to ADH-1 for 24 h enhanced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Tau in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). To confirm the effect of N-cadherin inhibition on p38 MAPK signaling and Tau phosphorylation in an alternative way, we applied N-cadherin-neutralizing antibody to murine primary neurons for 6 h followed by Western blot, and the same result was obtained as ADH-1 (supplemental Fig. S2). Next, we asked whether activation of p38 MAPK after inhibition of N-cadherin-based synaptic contact could lead to neuronal death. To answer this question, we examined neuronal cell viability after ADH-1 treatment using MTT assay. We observed significant decreases in neuronal cell viability after treatment with ADH-1 (n = 4, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). To evaluate whether p38 MAPK plays an important role in ADH-1-induced neuronal death, we used SB203580, a well characterized p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor. ADH-1 application with or without SB203580 revealed that neuronal death induced by ADH-1 was significantly attenuated by co-treatment with SB203580 (n = 4, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2C). Thus, the increased level of p38 MAPK activation is responsible for the ADH-1-induced neuronal death. To prove the effect of ADH-1 on the structural integrity of N-cadherin-mediated cell contact and p38 MAPK activation, ADH-1 (0.5 mg/ml) was added to confluent SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h. As expected, confocal microscopic analysis showed that the treatment with ADH-1 resulted in the significant decrease of N-cadherin immunoreactivity at the sites of cell-cell contact (Fig. 2D, left panels), indicating the disruption of N-cadherin-mediated cell contact. Consistent with the above result, enhanced immunoreactivity of phospho-p38 MAPK was observed in cells treated with ADH-1, compared with nontreated cells (Fig. 2D, middle panels). No immunoreactivities of both N-cadherin and phospho-p38 MAPK were observed in the absence of primary antibodies (supplemental Fig. S3). A number of recent studies have found that Aβ is synaptotoxic (20Hsieh H. Boehm J. Sato C. Iwatsubo T. Tomita T. Sisodia S. Malinow R. Neuron. 2006; 52: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 27Snyder E.M. Nong Y. Almeida C.G. Paul S. Moran T. Choi E.Y. Nairn A.C. Salter M.W. Lombroso P.J. Gouras G.K. Greengard P. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether Aβ could down-regulate N-cadherin expression in neurons. To assess the effect of Aβ on N-cadherin expressions, murine primary neurons were treated with synthetic Aβ42 peptides (100 nm) for 48 h and subjected to Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3A, Aβ42 treatment decreased N-cadherin expression in neurons. Previous reports have demonstrated that p38 MAPK is activated by the fibrillar Aβ (28Zhu X. Mei M. Lee H.G. Wang Y. Han J. Perry G. Smith M.A. Neurochem. Res. 2005; 30: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and that p38 MAPK can phosphorylate Tau at Ser-202/Thr-205 (29Reynolds C.H. Nebreda A.R. Gibb G.M. Utton M.A. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether synthetic Aβ42 peptides could trigger p38 MAPK activation and Tau phosphorylation at Ser-202/Thr-205 in our system. Consistent with the previous reports, we observed increased levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and phosphorylated Tau in the Aβ42-treated cell preparations as compared with nontreated ones by Western blot (n = 3, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3, A and B). Together, this experiment indicated that Aβ42 treatment decreases the levels of N-cadherin, activates p38 MAPK, and phosphorylates Tau in neuronal cells. Previous reports demonstrated that Aβ treatment induces excessive excitation of glutamate receptors to cause excitotoxicity (30Hynd M.R. Scott H.L. Dodd P.R. Neurochem. Int. 2004; 45: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 31Kihara T. Shimohama S. Sawada H. Honda K. Nakamizo T. Shibasaki H. Kume T. Akaike A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13541-13546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the decreased level of N-cadherin was induced by the Aβ-mediated excitotoxicity. To test this, murine primary neurons were pretreated (30 min) with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (10 μm) before being exposed to Aβ42. Subsequent Western blot analysis of cell lysates revealed that MK-801 inhibited Aβ42-induced reduction of N-cadherin levels (n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). To clarify the mechanistic link between the disruption of N-cadherin-based contact and p38 MAPK activation, we set out to identify the proteins that associate with N-cadherin in human brain samples. For this, lysates of temporal cortices from brains of AD and non-AD patients were immunoprecipitated with anti-N-cadherin antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were visualized by silver staining, demonstrating a protein band of ∼180 kDa in the lysates of brains of both AD patients and non-AD controls (supplemental Fig. S4). The protein band was identified by mass spectrometry as JLP, a scaffold protein that has been known to mediate the interaction between p38 MAPK and its upstream kinases (21Lee C.M. Onésime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14189-14194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To confirm the association between N-cadherin and JLP, we transiently transfected HA-tagged N-cadherin and/or FLAG-tagged JLP expression constructs into HEK293 cells. Equal amounts of cell lysates obtained from each transfected cell were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and then immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4A). A protein band of ∼180 kDa was visualized with anti-FLAG antibody in the immunoprecipitate using anti-HA antibody obtained from the double-transfected cells (Fig. 4A, third lane), clearly indicating that N-cadherin associates with JLP. To further verify this association, the lysates derived from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged N-cadherin and/or FLAG-tagged JLP plasmids were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, HA-tagged immunoreactivity was observed in the immunoprecipitate with anti-FLAG antibody, confirming the association of N-cadherin with JLP. Finally, to demonstrate the endogenous association between N-cadherin and JLP in neurons, murine primary neurons were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-N-cadherin antibody, and then subjected to Western blot with anti-JLP antibody (Fig. 4C). The result showed endogenous association between N-cadherin and JLP in murine primary neurons, as well as in human brains. To determine the N-cadherin-binding domains of JLP, a series of S-tagged JLP mutants truncated at the C terminus was transfected into COS7 cells (Fig. 5A). Immunoprecipitation with anti-N-cadherin antibody showed that all of the S-tagged C-terminal deletion mutants of JLP were associated with N-cadherin (Fig. 5B), indicating that the JLP N terminus plays an important role in the association with N-cadherin. To further characterize the sequences of JLP involved in this association, various N-terminally truncated JLP mutants tagged with the S-sequence were prepared as indicated (Fig. 5C). COS7 cells were transiently transfected with these deletion mutants, and the lysate derived from each transfected cell was subjected to immunoprecipitation assay with anti-N-cadherin antibody. We observed that the JLP fragment corresponding to the region of amino acids 160-463 was strongly associated with N-cadherin, whereas that corresponding to the region of amino acids 160–398 showed a weaker association with N-cadherin (Fig. 5D). In contrast, a shorter fragment corresponding to the region of amino acids 210–398, lacking amino acids 160–209 and leucine zipper II domain of amino acids 398–463, failed to co-immunoprecipitate with N-cadherin. These results implicated that both the region containing amino acids 160–209 and leucine zipper II domain in JLP are essential for its association with N-cadherin. We next focused on investigating the functional role of the molecular association between N-cadherin and JLP. Previously, JLP has been reported to act as a scaffolding protein to bring p38 MAPK together with their upstream kinases MKK4 and MEKK3 (21Lee C.M. Onésime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P.

https://openalex.org/W2037397639,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a member of a lipase family known to hydrolyze triglyceride molecules in plasma lipoprotein particles. LPL also plays a role in the binding of lipoprotein particles to cell-surface molecules, including sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). LPL is predominantly expressed in adipose and muscle but is also highly expressed in the brain where its specific roles are unknown. It has been shown that LPL is colocalized with senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains, and its mutations are associated with the severity of AD pathophysiological features. In this study, we identified a novel function of LPL; that is, LPL binds to amyloid β protein (Aβ) and promotes cell-surface association and uptake of Aβ in mouse primary astrocytes. The internalized Aβ was degraded within 12 h, mainly in a lysosomal pathway. We also found that sulfated GAGs were involved in the LPL-mediated cellular uptake of Aβ. Apolipoprotein E was dispensable in the LPL-mediated uptake of Aβ. Our findings indicate that LPL is a novel Aβ-binding protein promoting cellular uptake and subsequent degradation of Aβ."

The eukaryotic RNase H2 heterotrimeric complex recognizes RNA/DNA hybrids and (5′)RNA-DNA(3′)/DNA junction hybrids as substrates with similar efficiency, whereas bacterial RNases H2 are highly specialized in the recognition of the (5′)RNA-DNA(3′) junction and very poorly cleave RNA/DNA hybrids in the presence of Mg2+ ions. Using the crystal structure of the Thermotoga maritima RNase H2-substrate complex, we modeled the human RNase H2-substrate complex and verified the model by mutational analysis.

Our model indicates that the difference in substrate preference stems from the different position of the crucial tyrosine residue involved in substrate binding and recognition. Ribonucleases H (RNases H) are nucleases that cleave RNA/DNA hybrids (1Tadokoro T. Kanaya S. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1482-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The two main groups of RNases H (type 1 or RNases H1 and type 2 or RNases H2) share low sequence similarity and differ in their biochemical properties (2Ohtani N. Haruki M. Morikawa M. Crouch R.J. Itaya M. Kanaya S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, type 1 and type 2 RNases H have the same fold of the catalytic core, called the RNase H fold, a common feature of other related enzymes, such as integrases, transposases, Argonaute, and RuvC resolvase (3Nowotny M. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). They all belong to the retroviral integrase superfamily. The key feature of the RNase H fold is a β-sheet of three anti-parallel and two parallel strands. The active site of retroviral integrase superfamily proteins is predominantly composed of carboxylates that coordinate two divalent metal ions that are essential for catalysis. The preferred metal ions are Mg2+, but Mn2+ can also support the reaction. Type 1 enzymes require the presence of at least four ribonucleotides and hydrolyze the nucleic acid in the middle of the RNA sequence (2Ohtani N. Haruki M. Morikawa M. Crouch R.J. Itaya M. Kanaya S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The most unique and possibly most important feature of type 2 enzymes is their ability to cleave preferentially on the 5′ side of the last ribonucleotide in DNA-RNA-DNA/DNA substrates. RNases H2 hydrolyze these substrates even when a single ribonucleotide is present. Single ribonucleotides can result from misincorporation by DNA polymerases, which occurs frequently in eukaryotic cells (4Nick McElhinny S.A. Watts B.E. Kumar D. Watt D.L. Lundström E.B. Burgers P.M. Johansson E. Chabes A. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4949-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The presence of these ribonucleotides in the DNA can lead to genomic instability, and they must be removed (5Rydberg B. Game J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16654-16659Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Qiu J. Qian Y. Frank P. Wintersberger U. Shen B. Mol. Cell.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). RNase H2 works together with FEN-1 nuclease to completely excise single ribonucleotides from the DNA (5Rydberg B. Game J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16654-16659Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Qiu J. Qian Y. Frank P. Wintersberger U. Shen B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8361-8371Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). RNases H2 are present in all kingdoms of life. Bacterial enzymes contain a single subunit and prefer substrates in which a ribonucleotide has its 3′-phosphate connected to a deoxynucleotide (-XpRpDp-) being indifferent to the type of nucleotide on its 5′ side; RNA primers of Okazaki fragments and single ribonucleotides in duplex DNA are such substrates. The products after digestion of these substrates are a single ribonucleotide on the 5′-end of the downstream DNA (pRpDp-). Eukaryotic proteins consist of a catalytic subunit (RNase H2A), with striking similarities to the prokaryotic enzymes, and two auxiliary subunits (RNase H2B and RNase H2C) (8Jeong H.S. Backlund P.S. Chen H.C. Karavanov A.A. Crouch R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The latter share no significant sequence similarity with known proteins. Their roles are unclear, but they are required for activity (8Jeong H.S. Backlund P.S. Chen H.C. Karavanov A.A. Crouch R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Chon H. Vassilev A. DePamphilis M.L. Zhao Y. Zhang J. Burgers P.M. Crouch R.J. Cerritelli S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 96-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic RNases H2 cleave the same substrates as their bacterial homologs but also cleave an RNA/DNA hybrid in which no -RpDp- junction exists. Moreover, eukaryotic RNases H2 cleave RNA/DNA hybrids processively, whereas the prokaryotic enzymes act in a distributive manner. Archaeal RNases H2 have substrate preferences similar to the eukaryotic enzymes. Human type 2 RNase H is the main RNase H activity in human cells (10Frank P. Braunshofer-Reiter C. Wintersberger U.

Because no AGS patient has been observed with a complete loss of RNase H2, type 2 RNase H activity has been suggested to be essential in humans (12Crow Y.J. Leitch A. Hayward B.E. Garner A. Parmar R.

Shin D.Y. Shimada Y. Crouch R.J. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of archaeal and bacterial type 2 RNases H are available (14Muroya A.

Biol. 2001; 307: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition to the catalytic domain adopting the RNase H fold, they also contain a helical C-terminal domain. We recently reported the first crystal structures of bacterial RNase H2 in complex with nucleic acid, a 12-mer double-stranded DNA with a single ribonucleotide embedded in one of the strands (17Rychlik M.P. Chon H. Cerritelli S.M. Klimek P. Crouch R.J. Nowotny M. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 658-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). They demonstrated that the substrate is bound in a cleft between the catalytic and C-terminal domains. The 5′ phosphate of the (5′)RNA-DNA(3′) junction is located at the active site, and the 2′-OH group of the ribonucleotide interacts with conserved glycine, arginine, and glycine (GRG motif). An absolutely conserved tyrosine residue from the C-terminal domain forms a hydrogen bond with this 2′-OH group and a stacking interaction with the second residue of the junction. This stacking is the most efficient if no 2′-OH group is present in the ribose ring and, hence, selects for DNA, which leads to specific binding of the RNA-DNA junction. The stacking interaction with tyrosine also introduces a deformation of the substrate, allowing the phosphate group in the middle of the junction to participate in the coordination of a Mg2+ ion at the active site. Such substrate preference is lost in the presence of a Mn2+ ion because Mn2+ binding is not coupled to substrate deformation. While we were working on the determination of the structure of the human RNase H2 complex, the first structure of a eukaryotic RNase H2 from mouse was reported (18Shaban N.M. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3617-3624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showing that the catalytic subunit of the complex closely resembles the known structures of RNases H2 and that the auxiliary subunits form a highly intertwined dimer adopting a triple-barrel fold. Our human structure was solved at 3.1 Å resolution, and it differed from the mouse structure in tracing of the B and C subunits. In our refined structure, we have been able to map the positions of all currently reported RNase H2 mutations in AGS patients. Because of the similarities between the catalytic subunits of human and mouse RNases H2A and the monomeric Thermotoga maritima RNase H2, we used our bacterial RNase H2 complex structure (17Rychlik M.P. Chon H. Cerritelli S.M. Klimek P. Crouch R.J. Nowotny M. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 658-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to build a model of substrate binding by the human enzyme, which we verified through mutagenesis studies. To allow the testing of different combinations of truncated subunits, subunit A was cloned into a pET28 expression vector, and subunits B and C were cloned into a pET15 vector (EMD Biochemicals). All proteins carried N-terminal His tags removable with PreScission Protease (subunit A) or thrombin (subunits B and C). The mutagenesis of the constructs was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) or inside-out PCR. pET28-A and pET15-BC vectors with appropriate deletions were co-transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells for co-expression. Protein expression was induced overnight with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C. Bacterial cells were next suspended in 40 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol with the addition of a mixture of protease inhibitors and incubated on ice in the presence of 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After sonication, the cleared lysate was applied to a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm imidazole, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 m NaCl, and 5% glycerol. After a wash step with 60 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 60 to 300 mm. Fractions containing the protein were dialyzed overnight against 40 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The His tags were removed by overnight incubation with thrombin and PreScission Protease. The protease-digested sample was applied to a heparin column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 40 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.1 to 0.5 m. Selected fractions were next concentrated and applied to a gel filtration column (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare). The final protein sample was concentrated to 35–45 mg/ml and stored in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 75 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA. We previously constructed an E. coli system to overproduce a human RNase H2 mutant with the PCNA-interacting motif truncated (ABΔPIPC) (9Chon H. Vassilev A. DePamphilis M.L. Zhao Y. Zhang J. Burgers P.M. Crouch R.J. Cerritelli S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 96-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The initial crystallization trials with ABΔPIPC yielded crystals in a form of very thin and flexible plates or spherulites that could not be improved through optimization of the crystallization conditions. Deletion mutant AB14–233C crystallized more readily than the ABΔPIPC and yielded larger and regular crystals. For crystallization, the protein solution (13 mg/ml) was mixed with the reservoir solution at equal volumes and crystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. The crystals of AB14–233C complex were obtained with 0.1 m MgCl2, 15% PEG 3350, 0.1 m Bis-Tris (pH 5.5), and 2 mm reduced glutathione. The crystals were transferred stepwise to dehydrating solutions with increasing PEG 3350 concentrations up to a final concentration of 40% and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data of the AB14–233C complex crystals were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility at beamline 23-2 on a Mar225 CCD detector at 100 K. The dataset was processed and scaled using HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymol. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the P1 space group and contain six RNase H2 complexes per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the mouse RNase H2 structure (Protein Data Bank ID 3KIO) and Phaser program (20McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14444) Google Scholar). The resulting model was refined using phenix.refine (21Afonine P.V. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. CCP4 Newsletter. 2005; 42 (contribution 8)Google Scholar) and autoBuster (Global Phasing Ltd, Cambridge, UK). After several rounds of refinement it was apparent that the model from the molecular replacement did not fit well to electron density maps. Rebuilding the dubious regions involved changes to the previously assumed tracing and chain assignment. The most significant changes were introduced to the region defined in the human protein by two segments, B:83–96 and C:142–162 (Fig. 2, A, C, and E). Starting from residue B:Gly-83, the B chains of both human and mouse protein superimpose well until B:Val-91 (B:Met-91 in mouse RNase H2). Here, the B chain of the human protein continues in the same direction, whereas the mouse B chain makes a sharp turn and forms an α-helix. In the human structure this region is also a helix but belongs to subunit C (residues 148–158) and runs in the opposite direction. The other end of this helix is built in the mouse structure as a fragment of the C subunit (residues 112–116), which also adopts a helical structure, this time with the same polarity as the human C chain. Therefore, the single helix in the human structure (C:142–158) in the mouse structure is built as two helices coming from different chains and with opposite polarity. The mouse structure also contains a stray B:267–275 strand built into electron density, which we assigned to two fragments of the human protein: B:92–96 and C:158–161. The need to rebuild this region was justified by both the observation that the electron density in this area is clearly split in two traces and the fact that the deletion mutant of the B subunit we used for crystallization was C-terminally truncated at residue 233 and, thus, lacked the fragment corresponding to mouse residues B:267–275. Another fragment that was rebuilt in the human structure is the region corresponding to the mouse residues C:83–94 (Fig. 2, B, D, and E). Whereas the C:83–87 region forming a β-strand superimposes well with the human complex model, the C:89–94 part appears to fall out of register. The lack of density bridging the two β-strands in this region together with the analysis of the downstream sequence led us to assign residues C:119–124 in place of mouse C:89–94. Thus, instead of taking a sharp turn built in the mouse structure, the C chain of the human structure continues beyond that turning point into a non-visible and, hence, likely unstructured stretch of ∼30 residues and then resumes as the antiparallel β-strand. The structures of the A subunits of the mouse and human proteins are much more consistent. They are also similar to the published archaeal and bacterial structures, with the exception of the C-terminal fragment of the A subunit (∼50 residues), which is only present in eukaryotic RNases H2. A substantial proportion of this region is not visible in the mouse and human RNase H2 structures. However, because of the corrections we made to the C chain, we were able to trace the very last 16 residues of the A subunit that were misassigned to the C chain in the mouse model (Fig. 2E). The final rebuilt model was refined in autoBuster interspersed with manual building in Coot (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar). Structural analyses, including superpositions and structural figures, were prepared in PyMol (Schrödinger). The coordinates of the structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 3PUF. RNase H activity was determined using a uniformly [α-32P]ATP-labeled poly(rA)/poly(dT) substrate by measuring the amount of radioactivity of the acid-soluble digestion product in various solution conditions as described previously (23Gaidamakov S.A. Gorshkova I.I. Schuck P. Steinbach P.J. Yamada H. Crouch R.J. Cerritelli S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For assays with Mg2+, the enzyme concentrations were 0.02 and 0.2 nm, and for assays in the presence of Mn2+, the enzyme concentrations were 0.2 and 4 nm. For short substrate experiments, the 5′-32P-labeled 12-mer substrates (the sequences of the oligonucleotides are given in supplemental Fig. 3) were digested with native and mutant proteins in 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm MgCl2 (or 1 mm MnCl2). The hydrolysis products were analyzed on 20% Tris borate EDTA-urea polyacrylamide gels. The reaction products were visualized by phosphorimaging. The variants of human RNase H2 AB14–233C B:W73L, B:G83S, B:H86R, and B:Y219H were purified on a nickel column essentially using the same protocol as for wild type AB14–233C. The thermal stability of these proteins was analyzed using a ThermoFluor assay according to the published protocol with a few modifications (24Nettleship J.E. Brown J. Groves M.R. Geerlof A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 426: 299-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Proteins at 2 μm concentration were prepared in a 40-μl volume in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, and 5× SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen). Thermal denaturation of the proteins was monitored by measuring the fluorescence intensity using a SYBR Green filter on LightCycler480 (Roche Applied Science). The temperature of the protein solutions was linearly increased by 0.03 °C/s from 20 to 90 °C. The melting temperature (Tm) was defined as the temperature showing the maximum fluorescence gradient. Eukaryotic RNases H2 are considerably more complex enzymes than their prokaryotic homologs. The catalytic subunit (A) has N- and C-terminal extensions that are not present in the prokaryotic enzymes. The B and C accessory subunits are unique to eukaryotic RNases H2, and although their functions are unknown, they are assumed to assist the catalytic subunit. To determine which regions of the different subunits are important for complex formation, we made several deletions and tested the solubility and activity of the mutated complexes and individual subunits (supplemental Table 1). Deletion of the N- and C-terminal ends of the B subunit (a protein comprising residues 14–233) formed a complex that retained close to wild type activity and solubility. However, deletion of the N- (A24–299) or C-terminal (A1–250) extensions of the A subunit produced insoluble protein that could not form a complex with the B and C subunits when they were co-expressed in E. coli. In our hands the expression of RNase H2A alone resulted in mostly insoluble protein, and the small amount of enzyme that could be partially purified in soluble form was inactive for the cleavage of RNA/DNA and RNA-DNA/DNA hybrid substrates (data not shown). We obtained crystals of the human RNase H2 AB14–233C that diffracted x-rays to 3.1 Å resolution. We used the recently published structure of mouse RNase H2 (18Shaban N.M. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3617-3624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank ID 3KIO) as a search model in molecular replacement to solve the human RNase H2 structure. After several rounds of refinement, although the overall structures of the mouse and human complexes were very similar, some regions of the model needed to be rebuilt. This particularly involved the middle portions of the B and C subunits (see “Experimental Procedures”). The human structure was refined to a final R factor of 20.6% and Rfree of 25.5% (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of our crystals accommodates 6 copies of the human RNase H2 AB14–233C complex. Supplemental Table 2 provides the ranges of the residues that were traced in each copy of the complex. The six complexes were refined independently (non-crystallographic symmetry was not applied) and are essentially identical; they can be superimposed with a 0.74 Å root mean square deviation of the positions of 508 Cα atoms from each copy of the complex (supplemental Fig. 1). The three subunits of the complex are arranged in one line, with the C subunit located in the middle and B and A subunits on its sides (Fig. 1, A and B). The B and C subunits form an intertwined dimer that adopts a triple-barrel fold with a central core of 14 β-strands. The catalytic A subunit interacts almost exclusively with subunit C. An α-helix (residues 98–108) and three loops (residues 196–199, 227–232, and 250–256) of the A subunit make mostly hydrophobic contacts with four regions of the C subunit (residues 34–36, 47–51, 62–67, and 134–135) (Fig. 1, C and D). The extreme C-terminal fragment of subunit A (residues 284–299) also forms extensive contacts with subunits B and C, and residues 292–296 add a short β-strand to the central β-sheet of the triple-barrel of subunits B and C. Deletion of one of the regions described above (AΔ104–110) prevented complex formation (supplemental Table 1). We hypothesized that removing the hydrophobic regions of the catalytic subunit that are necessary for complex formation might yield a soluble and active single subunit RNase H2. To accomplish this, we deleted the hydrophobic region involved in complex interactions shown in Fig. 1D and C-terminal extension to produce A1–250,Δ104–110. Although the solubility of the mutated protein was higher than the wild type 2A, the protein was inactive (data not shown). To completely remove the regions of interactions with the accessory subunits, we also replaced the hydrophobic residues of the A subunit shown in Fig. 1C with the corresponding region of T. maritima RNase H2, which is soluble and active as a monomer. The resulting protein (A1–250,Δ104–110,Δ223–231,NGVL) remained inactive (data not shown), demonstrating the importance of the complex formation for activity. The complete description of the differences in tracing between mouse and human RNases H2 is given under “Experimental Procedures” and shown in Fig. 2.TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics for human RNase H2 structureData collectionSpace groupP1Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)90.1, 108.4, 114.3α, β, γ (°)105.9, 103.7, 111.4Wavelength (Å)0.87260Resolution (Å)aValues in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.50-3.1 (3.15-3.10)Rmerge10.7 (41.1)I/σ(I)11.8 (2.2)Completeness (%)97.1 (87.6)Redundancy2.8 (2.3)RefinementResolution (Å)3.1No. reflections63130Rwork/Rfree (%)20.6/25.5No. atoms25,820Protein25,729Water91Average B-factor64.4Protein64.5Water39.6Root mean square deviationBond lengths (Å)0.008Bond angles (°)1.03a Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.

Myoferlin and dysferlin regulate myoblast fusion and muscle membrane resealing, respectively. Correspondingly, myoferlin is most highly expressed in singly nucleated myoblasts, whereas dysferlin expression is increased in mature, multinucleated myotubes. Myoferlin also mediates endocytic recycling and participates in trafficking the insulin-like growth factor receptor. We have now characterized a novel member of the ferlin family, Fer1L5, because of its high homology to dysferlin and myoferlin.

We also found that Fer1L5 protein binds directly to the endocytic recycling proteins EHD1 and EHD2 and that the second C2 domain in Fer1L5 mediates this interaction. Reduction of EHD1 and/or EHD2 inhibits myoblast fusion, and EHD2 is required for normal translocation of Fer1L5 to the plasma membrane.

The characterization of Fer1L5 and its interaction with EHD1 and EHD2 underscores the complex requirement of ferlin proteins and mediators of endocytic recycling for membrane trafficking events during myotube formation. The ferlin family is defined by its homology to FER1, a Caenorhabditis elegans gene required for the fusion of intracellular organelles to the plasma membrane and normal reproduction in worms (1Achanzar W.E. Ward S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Washington N.L. Ward S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mammalian ferlin family has six members, and like C. elegans FER1, these proteins are defined by the presence of multiple C2 domains and a carboxyl-terminal membrane anchor. C2 domains are independently folding domains that can mediate protein-protein interactions as well as protein-membrane interactions. The C2 domains of synaptotagmins, the best characterized C2 domains, regulate the very rapid fusion of membrane-bound vesicles to the plasma membrane during fast exocytosis (3Bai J. Earles C.A.

The mammalian ferlin family is unique in that members have six or seven C2 domains. In mammals, three ferlins have been characterized, and two have been linked to inherited disease in humans. Dysferlin is highly expressed in muscle, and loss of function mutations lead to a recessive form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B and Miyoshi myopathy, a milder muscle disease (6Bashir R.

Otoferlin is highly expressed in the inner ear, and loss of function mutations in otoferlin lead to nonsyndromic deafness (8Yasunaga S. Grati M. Cohen-Salmon M. El-Amraoui A. Mustapha M. Salem N. El-Zir E. Loiselet J. Petit C. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In muscle, membrane fusion is important for repair of plasma membrane as well as for the fusion of myoblasts to form multinucleate myotubes. The absence of dysferlin renders the sarcolemma less able to reseal after laser-induced damage (9Bansal D. Miyake K. Vogel S.S. Groh S. Chen C.C. Williamson R. McNeil P.L. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2003; 423: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Myoferlin is most related to dysferlin, showing homology within the C2 domains and in the intervening regions, and the loss of myoferlin leads to impaired myoblast fusion (10Doherty K.R. Cave A.

Myoferlin-null mice have smaller muscle fibers and delayed muscle healing after damage (10Doherty K.R. Cave A. Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J. Posey A. Earley J.U. Hadhazy M. McNally E.M. Development. 2005; 132: 5565-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Three additional genes, fer1L4, fer1L5, and fer1L6, are present in the human and mouse genomes, but little is known about their expression at the protein level or their function. Myogenesis occurs through the fusion of singly nucleated myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes, a process that is recapitulated during muscle regeneration. Myoblast fusion begins with the recognition of appropriate fusion partners followed by cell attachment and finally the merging of membrane bilayers of two apposing cells into a single bilayer. Prior to membrane coalescence in fusing myoblasts, an accumulation of vesicles at sites of fusion can be observed on electron micrographs of fusing muscle cells (11Doberstein S.K. Fetter R.D.

We have now characterized Fer1L5, the only other mammalian ferlin to contain an NPF motif. We found that Fer1L5 is expressed in myoblasts undergoing fusion to myotubes and that Fer1L5 can bind both EHD1 and EHD2, two EHD family members that are also expressed in myoblasts. siRNA-mediated reduction of EHD1 and/or EHD2 expression leads to impaired myoblast fusion. Reduction of EHD2 protein levels inhibits normal transit of Fer1L5 through the secretory system to the plasma membrane. EHD proteins and ferlin proteins form discrete structures in myoblasts. From these data, we propose a model where multiple ferlin proteins interact with EHD proteins to mediate the cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for proper membrane recycling and myoblast fusion. C2C12 cells were obtained from ATCC (catalogue number CRL-1772). The cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in 7.5% CO2. The cells were differentiated in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in 7.5% CO2. All of the tissue culture media and sera were from Invitrogen. For immunoblot time course analysis, C2C12 cells were plated at equal densities on 10-cm tissue culture plates and harvested at specified time points. The cultures were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton, 1% Halt protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce), and PMSF). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Fifty μg of protein was separated on a 4–20% acrylamide gel stained with GelCode Blue stain reagent (Pierce) or transferred to PVDF Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-myoferlin at 1:3000 (MYOF3) (10Doherty K.R. Cave A. Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J. Posey A. Earley J.U. Hadhazy M. McNally E.M.

Peptides for anti-Fer1L5 antibody production were selected using MacVector. The peptide EQKDQPRKEMEKTRSWQPWK (amino acids 1031–1050) was synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected into rabbits (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TA) to generate anti-Fer1L5 ab1005. A second antibody, anti-Fer1L5 ab412 was generated against the peptide sequence RGGKKPPFRTSEEGTCIMDA (amino acids 438–457). The specificity of the antibodies was tested by blocking the immunostaining from 2 μg of antibody with 40 μg of respective peptides. Other than this specificity test, ab412 was not used. Secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), were used at a dilution of 1:5000.

To quantify ferlin expression in a 4-day differentiated culture of C2C12 cells, nuclei within myoferlin-, Fer1L5-, and dysferlin-positive cells were counted and classified as singly nucleated, containing two to four nuclei or containing five or more nuclei using the Cell Counter Plugin for Image J.

Primers corresponding to each of these nucleotide regions were designed and used to amplify inserts from mouse Fer1L5 and myoferlin cDNA templates. The inserts were ligated into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Mutant versions of Fer1L5 C2B were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu Turbo polymerase and the following sets of primers: NPF to dysferlin C2B sequence SPL (forward, 5′-ATCAAGATGGGAAACTCTCCTCTCTTCAATGAGATATTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAATATCTCATTGAAGAGAGGAGAGTTTCCCATCTTGAT-3′) and NPF to fer1L4 C2B sequence CPF (forward, 5′-ATCAAGATGGGAAACTGTCCTTTCTTCAATGA03′; reverse, 5′-TCATTGAAGAAAGGACAGTT-TCCCATCTTGAT-3′).

Cultures of BL21 cells (Invitrogen) expressing glutathione S-transferase-Fer1L5 C2 domain and glutathione S-transferase-myoferlin C2B fusion proteins were induced for 3 h with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 350 mm. The cells were resuspended in 50 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. Fifteen μl of cell lysate was loaded on a 12% acrylamide gel. For each experiment, two gels were used; one was transferred to PVDF membrane used for the gel overlay, and the other was stained with GelCode Blue stain reagent (Pierce). The EHD1 cDNA was digested from the EHD1-DsRed construct (17George M. Ying G. Rainey M.A. Solomon A. Parikh P.T. Gao Q. Band V. Band H.

PVDF membranes containing the GST fusion proteins of C2 domains were blocked for 2 h at 4 °C in blocking buffer (0.1% gelatin, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween in 1× PBS, pH 7.5) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in overlay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) containing the radioactive EHD1 and EHD2. The membrane was washed four times for 20 min at 4 °C in overlay buffer and exposed to film overnight at −80 °C. Cultures of BL21 cells expressing glutathione S-transferase-DysF domain + epitope regions from dysferlin, Fer1L5, and myoferlin were induced for 3 h with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 350 mm. The cells were resuspended in 50 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. Twenty-five μl of cell lysate from dysferlin and myoferlin cultures and 12.5 μl of cell lysate from Fer1L5 culture was separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. For each experiment, two gels were used; one was transferred to PVDF membrane used for the gel overlay, and the other was stained with GelCode Blue stain reagent (Pierce). The PVDF membrane was immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-Fer1L5 (antibody 1005) primary antibody 1:1000 and goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody 1:5000. Blocking and antibody incubations were performed in StartingBlock T20 blocking buffer (catalogue number 37543; Pierce). ECL-Plus chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak Biomax MS film were used for detection. A 650-bp region of Mus musculus EHD1 3′-UTR was amplified from C2C12 cDNA through RT-PCR using the primers 5′-CCACTTTCTAACCACCAGCTCCTTGTCTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCACTACAGAACACTAAGTAGCTTATGC-3′ (reverse). 500 bp of EHD1 3′-UTR and EHD2 3′-UTR were amplified from cDNA with T7 priming sites using the primers EHD1 (forward, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATTTTTCAAGGTCCATAAAG-3′; reverse, 5′GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGACGTCATGGACTGTCTCGC-3′) and EHD2 (forward, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACTGCCTGCCTACCCTGCCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGATGTCACACTCCTGAGAGT-3′). In addition, three regions of ∼500 bp each were amplified from Fer1L5 cDNA with T7 priming sites using the primers siRNA1 (forward, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCATCTGTGCCCTCG-3′; reverse, S5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAGTGCCTTCCTCTGA-3′), siRNA2 (forward, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAACATCCTCAACAAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGGGCAACAAGTAAAT-3′), and siRNA3 (forward, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACTATGCTTCATCCTCCTGAGCGAAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAACAGCTCTGCTCTTCTTGTCAGAAG-3′). The three Fer1L5 amplicons were pooled into one sample. Amplicons were in vitro transcribed using the TurboScript T7 Transcription Kit (Genlantis, San Diego, CA). EHD1, EHD2, and Fer1L5 double-stranded RNA fragments were digested into 22-bp siRNAs using the recombinant human Turbo dicer enzyme kit (Genlantis). Genlantis provided a nonspecific siRNA control, GFP siRNA. C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate and transfected with 500 ng of siRNA 16 h after plating. Transfected C2C12 cells were differentiated for 4 days. The cells were lysed, and the proteins were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to PVDF and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-EHD1 (1:1000), goat polyclonal anti-EHD2 (1:1000), rabbit polyclonal anti-Fer1L5 (antibody 1005) (1:1000), mouse monoclonal anti-desmin (1:1000), or mouse monoclonal anti-smooth muscle actin (1:1000). The cells were immunostained with mouse monoclonal anti-desmin (Sigma) and Sytox Green (Invitrogen), and nuclei within desmin-positive cells were counted and used to classify cells as mononucleated, binuclear, or containing three or more nuclei using the Cell Counter Plugin for Image J. Statistical analysis was performed with Prism using an unpaired t test as described (10Doherty K.R. Cave A. Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J. Posey A. Earley J.U. Hadhazy M. McNally E.M.

The Fer1L5 gene was identified based on homology to dysferlin (fer1L1) and myoferlin (fer1L3) and verified by RT-PCR as well as IMAGE cDNA clones. The open reading frame of Fer1L5 sequence is 6117 bp and predicts a protein of 2038 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 236 kDa (Fig. 1A). The mammalian ferlin family members share characteristic conserved features, including a single transmembrane domain and six C2 domains. The Fer1L5 protein contains six predicted C2 domains: C2A at amino acids 1–98, C2B at 168–264, C2C at 325–422, C2D at 1078–1222, C2E at 1487–1586, and C2F at 1659–1851. Each C2 domain is directly homologous to those previously identified in dysferlin and myoferlin (7Liu J. Aoki M. Illa I. Wu C. Fardeau M. Angelini C. Serrano C. Urtizberea J.A. Hentati F. Hamida M.B.

Ferlin C2 domains share stronger similarity to positionally equivalent domains in other ferlin family members than to C2 domains within the same molecule (6Bashir R. Britton S. Strachan T. Keers S.

Genet. 1998; 20: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Myoferlin, Fer1L5, and dysferlin are unique from the other ferlin family members in that they also contain a DysF domain present in the ferlins that is the hypothesized binding site for caveolin-3 (31Patel P.

The DysF domain is also found in the human β-propeller protein DKFZP434B0335 and the yeast peroxisomal proteins Pex30p and Pex31p (31Patel P. Harris R. Geddes S.M. Strehle E.M. Watson J.D. Bashir R.

A seventh C2 domain can be identified between C2D and C2E in dysferlin and myoferlin by the SMART algorithm and other protein prediction programs (29Letunic I. Copley R.R. Pils B. Pinkert S. Schultz J. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D257-D260Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 32Therrien C. Dodig D. Karpati G. Sinnreich M. J. Neurol. Sci. 2006; 250: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); however, this domain is highly divergent from the standard C2 domain profile. C2C12 cells are a transformed mouse myoblast-like cell line that can be induced to differentiate into myotubes upon serum starvation, mimicking the pattern of primary cultured myoblasts (33Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). We compared the expression patterns of myoferlin, dysferlin, and Fer1L5 throughout differentiation using antibodies specific for dysferlin and myoferlin (30Davis D.B. Delmonte A.J. Ly C.T. McNally E.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and a newly generated antibody to Fer1L5 protein. The anti-Fer1L5 antibody epitope is unique to Fer1L5, and correspondingly the homologous regions from myoferlin and dysferlin show no reactivity to this antibody (supplemental Fig. S1). Myoferlin was maximally expressed in early differentiating myoblasts (Fig. 1B, days 0 and 1, where day 0 represents the switch to differentiation media). Dysferlin was maximally expressed in mature differentiated myotubes (days 6+). We found that Fer1L5 protein was expressed in a pattern more similar to that of dysferlin than of myoferlin (Fig. 1C). C2C12 cells grow and differentiate asynchronously, and individual cultures of cells can vary in terms of cell stages. For instance, a culture of mature, differentiated myotubes can also contain singly nucleated myoblasts as well as nascent microtubes, which we define as myotubes containing two to four nuclei. We performed immunofluorescence microscopy on C2C12 cells differentiated for 4 days using the same antibodies specific for ferlin proteins and correlated ferlin expression to cell stage by quantifying the number of nuclei in ferlin-stained cells (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2055337546,"Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a zinc finger-containing transcriptional factor, regulates a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stem cell reprogramming. Post-translational modifications of KLF4, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation, regulate its transcriptional activity. Most recent studies also demonstrate that KLF4 is targeted for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis during cell cycle progression. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that KLF4 is profoundly degraded in response to TGF-β signaling. We have identified the Cdh1-anaphase promoting complex as a putative E3 ligase that governs TGF-β-induced KLF4 degradation. The TGF-β-induced KLF4 degradation is mediated by the destruction box on the KLF4. Either depletion of Cdh1 by RNA interference or stabilization of KLF4 by disruption of its destruction box significantly attenuates TGF-β-induced ubiquitylation and degradation. In addition, depletion of Cdh1 or stabilization of KLF4 antagonizes TGF-β-induced activation of transcription. Determining the role of KLF4 proteolysis in response to TGF-β signaling has opened a new perspective to understand the TGF-β signaling pathway."

Because the information on specific cellular targets of different S100 proteins is still limited, we developed an affinity approach that selects for protein targets only binding to the physiologically active dimer of an S100 protein. Using this approach, we here identify IQGAP1 as a novel and dimer-specific target of S100P, a member of the S100 family enriched in the cortical cytoskeleton. The interaction between S100P and IQGAP1 is strictly Ca2+-dependent and characterized by a dissociation constant of 0.2 μm. Binding occurs primarily through the IQ domain of IQGAP1 and the first EF hand loop of S100P, thus representing a novel structural principle of S100-target protein interactions. Upon cell stimulation, S100P and IQGAP1 co-localize at or in close proximity to the plasma membrane, and complex formation can be linked to altered signal transduction properties of IQGAP1. Specifically, the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1 that is thought to function in assembling signaling intermediates at IQGAP1 scaffolds in the subplasmalemmal region is markedly reduced in cells overexpressing S100P but not in cells expressing an S100P mutant deficient in IQGAP1 binding. Furthermore, B-Raf binding to IQGAP1 and MEK1/2 activation occurring downstream of IQGAP1 in EGF-triggered signaling cascades are compromised at elevated S100P levels. Thus, S100P is a novel Ca2+-dependent regulator of IQGAP1 that can down-regulate the function of IQGAP1 as a signaling intermediate by direct interaction.

Intracellular Ca2+ signaling requires a network of different effectors that couple the signal, a transient and often locally restricted elevation in Ca2+ levels, to cellular responses. Among these effectors are families of Ca2+-binding proteins that function by interacting with and thereby modulating target proteins in their Ca2+-bound conformation. S100 proteins are the largest family of these effector proteins consisting of 21 different genes in humans (for reviews on S100 proteins, see Refs.1Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 2Heizmann C.W. Fritz G. Schäfer B.W. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d1356-d1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Santamaria-Kisiel L.

They are characterized by two EF hand-type Ca2+-binding sites, helix-loop-helix structures that coordinate Ca2+ through carbonyl, hydroxyl, and carboxyl oxygens located within the intrahelical loop. S100 proteins form homo- and heterodimers, and mutagenesis experiments as well as high resolution structures of S100 dimers complexed with target peptides have revealed that these dimers represent the physiologically relevant entity (for reviews see Refs. 3Santamaria-Kisiel L.

A number of S100 target proteins have been identified, including cytoskeletal elements, different enzymes, and receptors (1Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 2Heizmann C.W. Fritz G. Schäfer B.W. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d1356-d1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Santamaria-Kisiel L.

Acta. 2009; 1793: 993-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, the search for specific targets has been hampered by the fact that S100 proteins expose hydrophobic surfaces in their Ca2+-bound active conformation and thus tend to show unspecific interactions in this conformation. To circumvent this problem of unspecific hydrophobic interactions, we designed a strategy to probe for S100 protein interactions that are Ca2+-dependent but only occur with the biologically active dimer. The basis for this approach was the identification of a single residue in the S100P protein, Phe-15, that proved to be crucial for dimerization. Mutation of phenylalanine to alanine yielded an S100P variant that failed to dimerize but retained the capability to bind Ca2+ and to respond to Ca2+ binding with the exposure of hydrophobic residues (7Koltzscher M. Gerke V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9533-9539Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Comparing the interaction partners of this S100P F15A derivative that we considered unspecific with those binding to the wild-type dimeric S100P led to the identification of the membrane-cytoskeleton cross-linker ezrin as a dimer-specific and physiologically important target of S100P (8Koltzscher M. Neumann C. König S. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2372-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Extending this approach, we now show that IQGAP1 is another target protein of dimeric S100P that does not show an unspecific interaction with the monomeric variant of the S100 protein. IQGAP1 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the IQGAP family, which also includes IQGAP2 and -3 in humans. It is a multidomain protein that can recruit several interaction partners and that has been shown to function in signal transduction pathways and regulation of actin cytoskeleton and microtubule dynamics (for reviews see Refs. 9Brown M.D. Sacks D.B.

Through direct interaction it can inhibit the GTPase activity of Cdc42 and Rac1 thereby stabilizing their active, GTP-bound forms and increasing neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization that affects cell shape dynamics and motility (for review see Ref. 15Noritake J. Watanabe T. Sato K. Wang S. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2085-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Interaction with E-cadherin enables IQGAP1 to regulate cell-cell contacts (16Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), whereas the ability to bind actin and microtubule regulators, e.g. Dia1 and CLIP170, respectively, allows IQGAP1 to bridge the actin and microtubule networks, a function particularly relevant in the leading edge of migrating cells. Finally, through functioning as a scaffolding protein for signaling complexes, IQGAP1 is involved in different signaling pathways. Importantly, it can associate with B-Raf, MEK, and ERK isoforms, and it participates in the MAPK cascade possibly by facilitating the spatial coupling of the different kinases (for review see Ref. 17Sacks D.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The activity of IQGAP1 itself is also regulated by direct protein interactions. Apart from the activating Cdc42 and Rac1 associations, the effect of calmodulin binding is best studied. Calmodulin can bind to the IQ domain of IQGAP1, and when bound in its Ca2+-loaded conformation, it interferes with many of the other protein interactions of IQGAP1 thereby silencing IQGAP1 activity (18Briggs M.W. Sacks D.B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For example, Ca2+/calmodulin binding abrogates the activating Cdc42 interaction and also inhibits the interaction of IQGAP1 with B-Raf, thereby affecting other kinases of the MAPK pathway and down-regulating MAPK signaling, e.g. downstream of the EGF receptor (19Ren J.G. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22972-22982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we obtained further evidence for a role of IQGAP1 in linking Ca2+ and MAPK signaling. We identified Ca2+-bound S100P as a novel interaction partner of IQGAP1 and could show that S100P binding down-regulates both EGF-triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1 and EGF-induced MEK activation, however, without affecting the IQGAP1 interactions with Cdc42 and Rac1. This indicates that S100P is a novel and selective Ca2+-dependent regulator of IQGAP1 functions. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics in a 7% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. HeLa cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (SF9) insect cells were cultured in TC-100 medium with 10% FCS and 0.26% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma) at 27 °C in air atmosphere. The generation of pET-32a+ and pcDNA3.1 plasmids encoding the IQGAP1 full-length protein and different domains of IQGAP1 has been described (20Mbele G.O. Deloulme J.C. Gentil B.J. Delphin C. Ferro M.

The constructs encoding tagless, His-, or GFP-tagged versions of human S100P in pKK223-3-, pET-28a+-, or pEGFP-C2 as well as the constructs encoding YFP-tagged human S100A10 in pYFP-C1 and GST-tagged human N-ERMAD in pGEX-4T-1 have been described previously (8Koltzscher M.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding His-tagged S100P truncation and deletion mutants were generated by PCR. PCR was performed using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the pET-28a+ plasmid containing S100Pwt cDNA as a template, and oligonucleotide primers containing the respective deletions and restriction enzyme sites. For the expression of S100PΔ21–25 fused to an N-terminal GFP tag, the coding sequence of S100PΔ21–25 was cloned into the pEGFP-C2 vector using EcoRI and SalI restriction sites (Clontech). Expression of full-length GST-tagged IQGAP1 in SF9 insect cells employed Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis baculoviruses encoding GST-IQGAP1. After 72 h of infection, cells were scraped off and harvested by centrifugation (500 × g, 15 min). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm PMSF, and 10 μg/μl leupeptin and subjected to sonication (duty cycle 30%, output control 3). The lysed cells were centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h), and the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. After washing with the same buffer, the IQGAP1-containing matrix was used for in vitro binding assays. His-tagged or tagless S100Pwt and S100P deletion mutants as well as GST-tagged N-ERMAD and the His-tagged IQ domain of IQGAP1 were expressed in Escherichia coli cells (strain BL21(DE3)pLysS). Transformed bacteria were grown to an A600 of 0.6 at 37 °C, and recombinant protein expression was then induced by adding isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation (2500 × g; 10 min) and resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF). Cells were lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles and sonication (duty cycle 50%, output control 5), and the remaining cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. For the preparation of tagless S100Pwt and S100PΔ21–25 proteins, the resulting supernatants were dialyzed against 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel (Sigma) column equilibrated in dialysis buffer. After washing with increasing concentrations of NaCl (30 and 40 mm), tagless S100P proteins were eluted with dialysis buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. The pooled fractions were then dialyzed against 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 80 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm CaCl2. The dialyzed proteins were adjusted to a CaCl2 concentration of 5 mm and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated in dialysis buffer. After washing with the same buffer, bound S100P protein was eluted with dialysis buffer containing 2 mm EGTA. His-tagged S100Pwt or S100P deletion mutants were obtained by adjusting the supernatants after the 100,000 × g centrifugation step to a CaCl2 concentration of 5 mm and applying them to a phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 and no EDTA. After washing with the same buffer, bound S100P proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 1 mm EGTA. The eluted S100P-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF. Subsequently, the proteins were applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) column equilibrated in dialysis buffer. After washing with increasing concentrations of imidazole (25 and 35 mm), His-tagged S100P proteins were eluted with elution buffer (250 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF). The His-tagged IQ domain of IQGAP1 was prepared by applying the supernatant obtained after the ultracentrifugation step to a Ni-NTA-agarose column equilibrated with 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF. After washing with the same buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (25, 35, and 100 mm), His-tagged IQ domain was eluted with this buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. GST-tagged N-ERMAD was obtained by applying the soluble bacterial proteins to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with PBS. After washing with PBS, bound GST-tagged N-ERMAD was eluted with a buffer containing 100 mm glutathione and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The TnT® Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to produce [35S]methionine-labeled IQGAP1 domains or the full-length protein. Therefore, 1 μg of pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the respective cDNA was incubated with 12 μl of TnT® Quick Master Mix and 9 μCi of Redivue® l-[35S]methionine (GE-Healthcare) at 30 °C for 60 min. The success of the reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography, and the TnT® products were then further used for in vitro binding assays. His-tagged S100Pwt and S100P F15A were purified as described previously (8Koltzscher M. Neumann C. König S. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2372-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and used as affinity tools for probing placental protein extracts. Extracts were prepared by homogenizing frozen placenta in homogenization buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 35 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μm leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 1.5 mm PMSF) using a Waring blender. After centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was then dialyzed against 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 35 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μm leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 1.5 mm PMSF, and 2 mm NaN3. To screen for Ca2+-dependent interactions, CaCl2 was added to the placental protein extract to a final concentration of 0.7 mm. 30 mg of Ca2+-containing placental protein extract were then loaded onto Ni-NTA-agarose affinity columns containing 5 mg of purified His-tagged S100Pwt or S100P F15A, respectively. After washing the columns with dialysis buffer containing 0.7 mm CaCl2, Ca2+-dependently bound proteins were eluted with dialysis buffer containing 0.7 mm EGTA. The collected fractions were analyzed in gradient (7–15%) SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In vitro binding assays were performed using different column-based affinity chromatography approaches. To analyze the interaction of IQGAP1 and S100P, glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads containing 3 μg of immobilized GST-IQGAP1 were equilibrated in buffer A (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1.5 mm PMSF) containing either 3 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. 30 μg of tagless S100P protein were dialyzed against the respective equilibration buffer and added in the fluid phase. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h and washing with the same buffers, bound S100P protein was eluted with buffer A containing 7 mm EGTA. Fractions of the flow-through and of washing and elution steps were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots employing a monoclonal mouse anti-S100P antibody 3V. Gerke, unpublished data. and a goat anti-mouse POX-labeled secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). For precise mapping of the interaction motif in IQGAP1, His-tagged S100Pwt was immobilized on Ni-NTA-agarose beads in buffer A containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. To confirm that equivalent amounts of S100P protein were immobilized, small aliquots of the resin were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or probed by immunoblotting prior to the experiment. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled IQGAP1 domains were added to the immobilized His-S100Pwt and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. As a control, equal amounts of the in vitro translation products were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose alone. After washing with the respective binding buffers, bound proteins were eluted with boiling SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For mapping of the IQGAP1-binding site in S100P, the recombinantly expressed His-tagged S100P truncation or deletion mutants was immobilized on Ni-NTA-agarose as described above, and in vitro translated full-length IQGAP1 protein was added. Analysis of IQGAP1 bound to the different S100P derivatives was performed as described above. To compare S100Pwt and S100PΔ21–25 in terms of their ability to bind to the N-ERMAD of ezrin, 30 μg of the respective His tagged-S100P protein were immobilized on Ni-NTA-agarose beads equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.5 mm CaCl2. After incubation with 100 μg of GST-N-ERMAD for 2 h and extensive washing with the same buffer, bound GST-N-ERMAD was eluted with buffer A containing 5 mm EGTA. The collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using a monoclonal mouse anti-GST antibody (B14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) and a goat anti-mouse POX-labeled secondary antibody. SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore 3000 system (GE Healthcare) employing CM5 sensor chips. The flow buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20) was filtered through 0.22-μm filters (Millipore) and degassed before use. About 3000 response units of purified S100Pwt or S100PΔ21–25 were immobilized on the sensor chip using the amine coupling method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, using a flow rate of 5 μl/min, the chip surface was activated with a 7-min injection of a freshly prepared 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide solution, followed by injection of S100Pwt or S100PΔ21-25 at a concentration of 30 μg/ml in acetate buffer, pH 4.0. When the desired level of immobilization was achieved, unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester groups were blocked with a 7-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride. Sensorgrams (response units versus time) were recorded at 25 °C with a typical flow rate of 60 μl/min and injection times of 3 min. Controls for the contribution of the change in bulk refractive index were performed in parallel with blank flow cells that were activated with N-ethyl-N-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide and deactivated with ethanolamine in the absence of protein to be coupled and subtracted from all binding sensorgrams. Blank injections of the running buffer were also performed and subtracted from all the kinetic measurements. To analyze the binding affinity of the IQ domain to immobilized S100Pwt or S100PΔ21–25, different concentrations of the IQ domain covering the concentration range between 50 nm and 1.5 μm diluted in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 500 μm CaCl2 and 450 μm EGTA were injected into the flow cells. Each injection was repeated at least 2-fold for reproducibility. Regeneration of the surface was performed using one injection of 10 mm EGTA followed by a pulse injection of 50 mm NaOH. Approximate equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were obtained by measuring the equilibrium resonance (Req) units at several ligand concentrations at equilibrium. The affinity of the interaction, i.e. the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), was determined from the level of binding at equilibrium as a function of the sample concentrations by BIAEvaluation software version 4.1 (Biacore, Inc.). The steady state binding level is related to the concentration according to the Scatchard equation, Req/C = KARmax − ReqKA, where Rmax is the resonance signal at saturation; C is the concentration of free analyte, and KA is the equilibrium association constant. The Ca2+ dependence of IQ-S100P interaction was verified by performing IQ injections on the immobilized S100Pwt in flow buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20) containing either 2 mm HEDTA or 0.77 mm CaCl2 plus 2 mm HEDTA. The latter corresponded to a free Ca2+ concentration of 2.5 μm as determined by MaxChelator software. Binding of the IQ domain of IQGAP1 to S100Pwt and S100PΔ21–25 was directly compared by reaction of similar concentrations of this domain with the immobilized S100P proteins. Therefore, the two S100P proteins were immobilized to the same level of response units (flow cells 2 and 4 were used for S100P and S100PΔ21–25, respectively, and flow cells 1 and 3 were used as blank references). Injections of the IQ domain in running buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 500 μm CaCl2, and 450 μm EGTA) were then performed on all flow cells allowing the direct comparison between the response of IQ interaction with S100Pwt and S100PΔ21–25. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the pEGFP-S100Pwt expression construct. After 24 h, cells were washed once with PBS and scraped into 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 2.5 μm free Ca2+ (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm HEDTA, 0.77 mm CaCl2, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). Cell lysis was performed on an overhead shaker for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation (300 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The resulting post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was applied to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in lysis buffer either together with a polyclonal rabbit anti-IQGAP1 antibody (H-108, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or nonspecific anti-mouse IgG polyclonal rabbit antibodies (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C and washing with lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted with boiling SDS sample buffer. Samples of the PNS and the eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using a monoclonal mouse anti-IQGAP1 antibody (BD Biosciences) and a monoclonal mouse anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) followed by a goat anti-mouse POX-labeled secondary antibody. HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and serum-starved for 16 h. To stimulate cells, EGF was added to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml for 5 min at 37 °C. Control cells were maintained in FCS-free medium. Cells were then fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Following quenching in 50 mm NH4Cl for 7 min and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min, cells were treated with 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-S100P antibody (MAb 18-9, a gift from A. Gibadulinova, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-IQGAP1 antibody (raised against amino acids 1–863) each for 45 min and washed with PBS. Primary antibodies were detected with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Dianova) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies, respectively. Stained cells were mounted in Mowiol and analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pGFP-S100Pwt, pGFP-S100PΔ21–25, or pYFP-S100A10. After 16 h of serum starvation, cells were stimulated with EGF (E9644-.2MG, Sigma) at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml for 5 min at 37 °C. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1 was determined by immunoprecipitation. Therefore, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor mixture, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (both from Roche Diagnostics)), collected by scraping, and sonicated for 15 s. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (4000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and equal amounts of total soluble protein were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-IQGAP1 antibody coupled to magnetic sheep anti-rabbit Dynabeads® (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. The tyrosine phospho"

Activated protein C (APC), a natural anticoagulant with anti-inflammatory and endothelial barrier protective properties, significantly increased the barrier impedance of keratinocyte monolayers, measured by electric cell substrate impedance sensing and FITC-dextran flux. In response to APC, Tie2, a tyrosine kinase receptor, was rapidly activated within 30 min, and relocated to cell-cell contacts. APC also increased junction proteins zona occludens, claudin-1 and VE-cadherin. Inhibition of Tie2 by its peptide inhibitor or small interfering RNA abolished the barrier protective effect of APC. Interestingly, APC did not activate Tie2 through its major ligand, angiopoietin-1, but instead acted by binding to endothelial protein C receptor, cleaving protease-activated receptor-1 and transactivating EGF receptor. Furthermore, when activation of Akt, but not ERK, was inhibited, the barrier protective effect of APC on keratinocytes was abolished. Thus, APC activates Tie2, via a mechanism requiring, in sequential order, the receptors, endothelial protein C receptor, protease-activated receptor-1, and EGF receptor, which selectively enhances the PI3K/Akt signaling to enhance junctional complexes and reduce keratinocyte permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2104493977,"Protein synthesis is a key regulated cellular process that links nutrient availability and organismal growth. It has long been known that some cellular proteins continue to be synthesized under conditions where global translation is severely compromised. One prominent example is the selective translation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) under stress conditions. Although the transcriptional regulation of Hsp genes has been well established, neither the specific translation-promoting features nor the regulatory mechanism of the translation machinery have been clearly defined. Here we show that the stress-induced preferential translation of Hsp70 mRNA is negatively regulated by PI3K-mTORC1 signaling. Despite the transcriptional up-regulation, the translation of Hsp70 mRNA is deficient in cells lacking tuberous sclerosis complex 2. Conversely, Hsp70 synthesis is enhanced under the reduced PI3K-mTORC1 signaling. We found that the 5′ UTR of Hsp70 mRNA contributes to cap-independent translation without exhibiting typical features of internal ribosome entry site. Our findings imply a plausible mechanism for how persistent PI3K-mTORC1 signaling favors the development of age-related pathologies by attenuating stress resistance.

https://openalex.org/W2067462507,"Calreticulin is a soluble calcium-binding chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is also detected on the cell surface and in the cytosol. Calreticulin contains a single high affinity calcium-binding site within a globular domain and multiple low affinity sites within a C-terminal acidic region. We show that the secondary structure of calreticulin is remarkably thermostable at a given calcium concentration. Rather than corresponding to complete unfolding events, heat-induced structural transitions observed for calreticulin relate to tertiary structural changes that expose hydrophobic residues and reduce protein rigidity. The thermostability and the overall secondary structure content of calreticulin are impacted by the divalent cation environment, with the ER range of calcium concentrations enhancing stability, and calcium-depleting or high calcium environments reducing stability. Furthermore, magnesium competes with calcium for binding to calreticulin and reduces thermostability. The acidic domain of calreticulin is an important mediator of calcium-dependent changes in secondary structure content and thermostability. Together, these studies indicate interactions between the globular and acidic domains of calreticulin that are impacted by divalent cations. These interactions influence the structure and stability of calreticulin, and are likely to determine the multiple functional activities of calreticulin in different subcellular environments."
https://openalex.org/W2090739447,"FoxO1, a forkhead box O class transcription factor, is abundant in insulin-responsive tissues. Akt, downstream from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in insulin signaling, phosphorylates FoxO1 at Thr(24), Ser(256), and Ser(319), negatively regulating its function. We previously reported that dehydroepiandrosterone-stimulated phosphorylation of FoxO1 in endothelial cells requires cAMP-dependent protein kinase α (PKA-α). Therefore, we hypothesized that FoxO1 is a novel direct substrate for PKA-α. Using an immune complex kinase assay with [γ-(32)P]ATP, purified PKA-α directly phosphorylated wild-type FoxO1 but not FoxO1-AAA (mutant with alanine substitutions at known Akt phosphorylation sites). Phosphorylation of wild-type FoxO1 (but not FoxO1-AAA) was detectable using phospho-specific antibodies. Similar results were obtained using purified GST-FoxO1 protein as the substrate. Thus, FoxO1 is a direct substrate for PKA-α in vitro. In bovine aortic endothelial cells, interaction between endogenous PKA-α and endogenous FoxO1 was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. In human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC), pretreatment with H89 (PKA inhibitor) or siRNA knockdown of PKA-α decreased forskolin- or prostaglandin E(2)-stimulated phosphorylation of FoxO1. In HAEC transfected with a FoxO-promoter luciferase reporter, co-expression of the catalytic domain of PKA-α, catalytically inactive mutant PKA-α, or siRNA against PKA-α caused corresponding increases or decreases in transactivation of the FoxO promoter. Expression of vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 mRNA, up-regulated by FoxO1 in endothelial cells, was enhanced by siRNA knockdown of PKA-α or treatment of HAEC with the PKA inhibitor H89. Adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells was enhanced by H89 treatment or overexpression of FoxO1-AAA, similar to effects of TNF-α treatment. We conclude that FoxO1 is a novel physiological substrate for PKA-α in vascular endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1965150025,"Cadherins form a large family of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion receptors involved in development, morphogenesis, synaptogenesis, differentiation, and carcinogenesis through signal mechanotransduction using an adaptor complex that connects them to the cytoskeleton. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying mechanotransduction through cadherins remain unknown, although their extracellular region (ectodomain) is thought to be critical in this process. By single molecule force spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and protein engineering, here we have directly examined the nanomechanics of the C-cadherin ectodomain and found it to be strongly dependent on the calcium concentration. In the presence of calcium, the ectodomain extends through a defined (“canalized”) pathway that involves two mechanical resistance elements: a mechanical clamp from the cadherin domains and a novel mechanostable component from the interdomain calcium-binding regions (“calcium rivet”) that is abolished by magnesium replacement and in a mutant intended to impede calcium coordination. By contrast, in the absence of calcium, the mechanical response of the ectodomain becomes largely “decanalized” and destabilized. The cadherin ectodomain may therefore behave as a calcium-switched “mechanical antenna” with very different mechanical responses depending on calcium concentration (which would affect its mechanical integrity and force transmission capability). The versatile mechanical design of the cadherin ectodomain and its dependence on extracellular calcium facilitate a variety of mechanical responses that, we hypothesize, could influence the various adhesive properties mediated by cadherins in tissue morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and disease. Our work represents the first step toward the mechanical characterization of the cadherin system, opening the door to understanding the mechanical bases of its mechanotransduction. Cadherins form a large family of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion receptors involved in development, morphogenesis, synaptogenesis, differentiation, and carcinogenesis through signal mechanotransduction using an adaptor complex that connects them to the cytoskeleton. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying mechanotransduction through cadherins remain unknown, although their extracellular region (ectodomain) is thought to be critical in this process. By single molecule force spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and protein engineering, here we have directly examined the nanomechanics of the C-cadherin ectodomain and found it to be strongly dependent on the calcium concentration. In the presence of calcium, the ectodomain extends through a defined (“canalized”) pathway that involves two mechanical resistance elements: a mechanical clamp from the cadherin domains and a novel mechanostable component from the interdomain calcium-binding regions (“calcium rivet”) that is abolished by magnesium replacement and in a mutant intended to impede calcium coordination. By contrast, in the absence of calcium, the mechanical response of the ectodomain becomes largely “decanalized” and destabilized. The cadherin ectodomain may therefore behave as a calcium-switched “mechanical antenna” with very different mechanical responses depending on calcium concentration (which would affect its mechanical integrity and force transmission capability). The versatile mechanical design of the cadherin ectodomain and its dependence on extracellular calcium facilitate a variety of mechanical responses that, we hypothesize, could influence the various adhesive properties mediated by cadherins in tissue morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and disease. Our work represents the first step toward the mechanical characterization of the cadherin system, opening the door to understanding the mechanical bases of its mechanotransduction. The acquisition of specific machinery for cell adhesion represented a crucial step in the evolution of metazoan organisms, enabling multicellularity and the development of tissues. There are four major classes of cell adhesion receptors: the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like superfamily, the cadherin superfamily, selectins, and integrins (1Hynes R.O. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M33-M37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because of their location at the cell-cell interface, these receptors are often subject to mechanical stress (2Vogel V. Sheetz M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 3Schwartz M.A. DeSimone D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, to date only the mechanical properties of Ig and fibronectin type III domains have been investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) 5The abbreviations used are: AFM, atomic force microscopy; SMFS, single molecule force spectroscopy; EC, ectodomain of cadherins; MD, molecular dynamics; SMD, steered MD; ΔLc, increase in contour length; WLC, wormlike chain; TM, triple mutant; pN, piconewtons; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.-based single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) and protein engineering (4Carrión-Vázquez M.

Cadherins can be defined (with some exceptions) as a superfamily of calcium (Ca2+)-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion proteins that mediate most cell adhesion in vertebrates, playing a crucial role in morphogenesis, synaptogenesis, tissue architecture, tissue repair, and carcinogenesis (5Takeichi M.

Still, certain cadherins are heterophilic or/and connect two membranes from the same cell. At least in the case of the so-called “classical” cadherins (6Tepass U. Truong K. Godt D. Ikura M. Peifer M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 8Yagi T. Takeichi M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1169-1180PubMed Google Scholar), their connection to the cytoskeleton appears to be mediated by several adaptor proteins (Refs. 9Pérez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E.

This linkage is responsible for reinforcing cell-cell adhesion through a signaling pathway involving the activation of Rho, Rac, Cdc42, and the Arp2/3 actin nucleator complex (12Kim S.H. Li Z.

External mechanical stimuli are among the signals transduced by cadherins, which can induce changes in cell shape and synaptic plasticity (6Tepass U. Truong K. Godt D. Ikura M. Peifer M. Nat. Rev.

Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) signaling. Furthermore, cadherin interactions are known to exert forces that have already been measured (21Ganz A. Lambert M. Saez A. Silberzan P. Buguin A. Mège R.M. Ladoux B. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Classical cadherins are single pass transmembrane glycoproteins of 720–750 amino acids with an extracellular region (ectodomain or EC) that has a rodlike structure composed of five autonomously folded tandem domains (extracellular cadherin domains EC1–EC5 from the distal N terminus to the proximal C terminus; see Fig. 1, A and B). Although it is accepted that these cadherins establish homophilic interactions in cis and trans (22Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), the quaternary structure of these complexes remains unclear. The resolution of the atomic structure of the entire ectodomain of C-cadherin (a classical cadherin; Ref. 23Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L. Science. 2002; 296: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) led to the proposal that trans interactions were based on a “β-strand-swapping” mechanism that only involved EC1, whereas the cis interactions also involved EC2. This model was consistent with electron microscopy data (24He W. Cowin P. Stokes D.L. Science. 2003; 302: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 25Hewat E.A. Durmort C. Jacquamet L.

J. 2003; 84: 4033-4042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that, although the model derived from the atomic structure of the ectodomain could be correct, it appears not to be exclusive as several interactions resulting from different degrees of overlap of the cadherin ectodomains are likely to occur. Indeed, the strongest interaction was detected with a complete overlap. Interestingly, recent evidence points to the existence of an intermediate binding conformation (termed “X-dimer”), which is necessary for the subsequent formation of the mature β-strand-swapping interaction (32Sivasankar S.

Furthermore, non-classical cadherins seem to use a different mechanism of interaction (34Ciatto C. Bahna F. Zampieri N. VanSteenhouse H.C. Katsamba P.S. Ahlsen G. Harrison O.J. Brasch J. Jin X.

Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) makes the study of their nanomechanics a critical task as the first step toward understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms. To this end, unveiling the specific mechanical role of their ectodomain is essential. Related to this, the ectodomain has been postulated to function as a “force sensor” (37Giannone G. Mège R.M. Thoumine O. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 475-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 38Ladoux B. Anon E. Lambert M. Rabodzey A. Hersen P. Buguin A. Silberzan P. Mège R.M. Biophys. J. 2010; 98: 534-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), although the force sensitivity of cadherin junctions is still a matter of debate. Thus, in this context, it is highly relevant to study not only its intermolecular interactions (i.e. cis and trans, on which all nanomechanical studies of cadherins have focused so far; Refs. 29Baumgartner W. Hinterdorfer P. Ness W. Raab A. Vestweber D. Schindler H. Drenckhahn D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 4005-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 30Baumgartner W. Golenhofen N.

Structure. 2009; 17: 1075-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) but also the intramolecular interactions within the monomer. It is known that mature cadherin interactions are disrupted upon depletion of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium (5Takeichi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 22Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and indeed, cadherins were also proposed to function as “Ca2+ sensors” (39Wiest M.C. Eagleman D.M. King R.D. Montague P.R. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cadherin ectodomain loses its rigidity and becomes a very flexible structure at low Ca2+ concentrations (40Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 41Alattia J.R. Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tong K.I. Heng Y.M. Ottensmeyer P. Kay C.M. Ikura M.

Biol. 2002; 324: 823-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis is that the nanomechanics of the monomeric cadherin ectodomain may change under different Ca2+ concentrations and that this differential response may affect the transduction of the mechanical signals within the cell. We have chosen C-cadherin as a study system as this is the only cadherin for which the atomic structure of the whole ectodomain is available. C-cadherin is implicated in cell adhesion during the early stages of the development (i.e. the compaction of the morula) of Xenopus laevis (45Choi Y.S. Sehgal R. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1575-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 46Ginsberg D. DeSimone D. Geiger B. Development. 1991; 111: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein contains five EC domains, and each interdomain region can bind three Ca2+ ions such that the entire ectodomain is capable of binding 12 Ca2+ ions (Ref. 23Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L. Science. 2002; 296: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar and see Fig. 1B). Ca2+ binding has a marked effect on the conformation of the protein as the binding of Ca2+ induces rigidity, whereas the unbound protein has a flexible structure (23Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L. Science. 2002; 296: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 40Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J.

Although the role of Ca2+ in the structure and function of cadherins is well documented, to date no experimental data are available regarding the modulatory effects of Ca2+ binding on the nanomechanics of the ectodomain. This is particularly relevant given that these proteins are considered to act as mechanotransducers (3Schwartz M.A. DeSimone D.W. Curr. Opin.

The cadherin fold, a compact unit with overall dimensions of ∼45 × 25 × 25 Å in the presence of Ca2+, is a Greek key fold with the N and C termini pointing toward opposite ends of the domain. This topology is remarkably similar to that of the Ig-like fold and superimposes quite well onto Ig I type (“intermediate”; Ref. 49Rader C. Sonderegger P. Sonderegger P. Ig Superfamily Molecules in the Nervous System. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 1-22Google Scholar), a class that includes the majority of Ig domains that are present in cell adhesion proteins, surface receptors, and muscle proteins (50Harpaz Y. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Both folds consist of seven β-strands with antiparallel pairings except for that between the A′ and G strands. These similarities are not likely to be the result of either sequence divergence or functional convergence but rather that of structural convergence (51Shapiro L. Kwong P.D. Fannon A.M. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 6793-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The nanomechanics of proteins with similar folds has previously been studied by AFM-based SMFS, revealing a relatively high mechanical stability for all of them (4Carrión-Vázquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Díez H. Hervás R. Oroz J. Fernández J. Martínez-Martín D. Arrondo J.L.R. Alonso L. Advanced Techniques in Biophysics. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2006: 163-245Google Scholar). Here, using this technique and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have directly measured the nanomechanical properties of the C-cadherin ectodomain and the effects of Ca2+ binding. We found that, upon Ca2+ binding, this structure rigidifies and “canalizes” its nanomechanical behavior, generating a novel mechanical element (the “Ca2+ rivet”). The purified recombinant ectodomain of C-cadherin from X. laevis (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry P33148) was provided by Dr. Barry Gumbiner (22Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The protein was kept frozen (−80 °C) at ∼0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) with either 1 mm CaCl2 (“presence of Ca2+”) or 1 mm EGTA (“absence of Ca2+”). To construct the heteropolyproteins containing the EC cadherin domains and the I27 marker domains (52Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrión-Vázquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernández J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we used the only “ready-to-go” cloning/expression vector available (Ref. 53Steward A. Toca-Herrera J.L. Clarke J. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2179-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and see Fig. 1C). A plasmid encoding the entire ectodomain of C-cadherin (22Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) was used as a template for the cloning of EC domains. To construct the (I27)3-EC1–5-I27 polyprotein, the KpnI and MluI sites present in the I27-containing vector (53Steward A. Toca-Herrera J.L. Clarke J. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2179-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were used as cloning sites. In the case of the (I27)3-EC1–2-(I27)2 and (I27)3-EC2-(I27)2 polyproteins, the KpnI and SpeI sites were selected for cloning. To construct the triple mutant (TM) D67A/D100A/D134A, the wild type EC1–2 sequence was cloned into the pT7blue vector (Novagen) using KpnI and SpeI sites prior to performing site-directed mutagenesis (one point mutation at a time) using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). This construct was called EC1–2TM and was cloned into the KpnI and SpeI sites of the aforementioned expression vector, which contains the I27 marker domains (53Steward A. Toca-Herrera J.L. Clarke J. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2179-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Domain boundaries were chosen according to those deposited in the Swiss-Prot Database (entry P33148) and in the Protein Data Bank (code 1l3w). The EC1–5 protein contained residues 1–540, EC1–2 residues 1–214, and the EC2 domain residues 102–214 based on the sequence of the mature C-cadherin. All the sequences were verified by sequencing both strands of the DNA, and the cloning steps were carried out in the Escherichia coli XL1-Blue strain (Stratagene). Heteropolyproteins were expressed in the E. coli C41(DE3) strain (54Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A595 of 0.6–0.8 after which the expression of the recombinant heteropolyproteins was induced over 4 h by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. We determined the solubility of proteins by immunoblotting the soluble and insoluble fractions. The bacterial cells were lysed by treatment with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (55Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Recombinant heteropolyproteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography using HisTrap HP FPLC columns (GE Healthcare) on an FPLC apparatus (ÄKTA Purifier, GE Healthcare) with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5), which was added with 50 mm imidazole for binding and 500 mm imidazole for elution. Either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA was added to the samples prior to the purification processes but not to the purification buffers (as recommended by GE Healthcare). Afterward, gel filtration purification was performed using a HiLoad 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) added with either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA (absence of Ca2+). The concentrations of CaCl2 and EGTA mentioned above were chosen on the basis of previous reports demonstrating that they saturated all the Ca2+ binding sites (40Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), respectively. The purified proteins were kept at ∼0.5 mg/ml at 4 °C. For the analysis of the (I27)3-EC1–2-(I27)2 polyprotein in 0.1 mm CaCl2, an aliquot of the polyprotein that was purified in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 was dialyzed extensively against a 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing no added Ca2+. Finally, several dialysis steps against a 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.5) buffer were performed followed by concentration of the polyprotein sample in the same buffer by ultrafiltration using Amicon 10 K filters (Millipore). No Ca2+/EGTA buffer was used to prepare this buffer based on the assumption that the residual Ca2+ concentration in Milli-Q water is in the low μm range (56Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). To analyze the (I27)3-EC1–2-(I27)2 polyprotein in the presence of magnesium ions (Mg2+), we dialyzed an aliquot of the polyprotein (purified in the presence of EGTA) extensively against a 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing neither EGTA nor Mg2+. A final dialysis step against a 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.5) buffer was performed followed by a dilution of the protein sample in the same buffer. The concentration of each protein was estimated by spectrophotometry using its molar extinction coefficient. All the heteropolyproteins constructed using this method end with two C-terminal cysteine residues for their covalent attachment to the gold-coated coverslips used as AFM substrates. However, to avoid rupturing the disulfide bonds present in EC5 (23Boggon T.J. Murray J. Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. Shapiro L. Science. 2002; 296: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), we only used reducing agents with (I27)3-EC1–2-(I27)2 and (I27)3-EC2-(I27)2 but not with the (I27)3-EC1–5-I27 polyproteins. The heteropolyprotein (I27)3-EC1–5-I27 was highly insoluble, and only small amounts were obtained after purification, hindering the collection of sufficient data for statistical analysis. We also attempted to construct heteropolyproteins containing EC domains 4 and 5, (I27)3-EC4–5-(I27)2, but encountered difficulties in their expression that rendered them unsuitable for AFM studies. The expression of heteropolyproteins was performed in E. coli, whereas the expression of the entire ectodomain alone was performed in CHO cells (22Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).

Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). IKr is important for cardiac repolarization, and its reduction causes long QT syndrome (LQTS), a disorder that predisposes individuals to life-threatening arrhythmias (3Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M. Nature. 2006; 440: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Mutations in hERG cause type 2 inherited long QT syndrome (LQT2), and a diverse variety of medications can block hERG and cause acquired LQTS as a cardiac side effect (4Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In addition, a reduction in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) exacerbates LQTS (5Roden D.M. Woosley R.L. Primm R.K. Am. Heart J. 1986; 111: 1088-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Using an in vivo rabbit model, we previously demonstrated that hypokalemia chronically reduces IKr and prolongs the action potential duration and the QT intervals of electrocardiograms. We further showed that extracellular K+ (K+o) is required for hERG function and membrane stability; upon depletion of K+o, hERG channels enter into a non-conducting state within minutes and are subsequently internalized and degraded within hours (6Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Investig. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Massaeli H. Guo J. Xu J. Zhang S. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated an involvement of caveolin in low K+-induced internalization of cell surface hERG channels (8Massaeli H. Sun T. Li X. Shallow H. Wu J. Xu J. Li W. Hanson C. Guo J. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27259-27264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the cellular machinery for hERG endocytic degradation is largely unknown. In particular, although ubiquitin (Ub) is found to be involved in the internalization of cell surface hERG channels (6Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Investig. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Massaeli H. Guo J. Xu J. Zhang S. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the nature of Ub-hERG interactions is not known.Ub is a protein with a highly conserved sequence of 76 amino acids found in every eukaryotic cell. The covalent binding of Ub to target proteins is known as ubiquitination, a process well known for labeling proteins for degradation (9Haglund K. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 598-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 10Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Appendage of a single Ub moiety leads to monoubiquitination, whereas attachment of a chain of Ub leads to polyubiquitination. Although polyubiquitination targets proteins for proteasomal degradation (11Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), monoubiquitination targets membrane proteins for internalization and lysosomal degradation. As an internalization signal of membrane proteins, monoubiquitination is well described in yeast (12Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 13Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 14Lucero P.

Heart J. 1986; 111: 1088-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We recently showed that hypokalemia enhances cell surface hERG internalization and degradation and thus identified a novel mechanism through which hypokalemia induces cardiac arrhythmias (6Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Investig. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although our work showed that Ub is involved in endocytic degradation of cell surface hERG channels under low K+ conditions (6Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Investig. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Massaeli H. Guo J. Xu J. Zhang S. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the nature of Ub-hERG interactions is unknown. The present study demonstrated that monoubiquitination mediates degradation of the voltage-gated K+ channel hERG under low K+ conditions. This conclusion is supported by the observations that overexpression of UbKO enhanced the degradation of the 155-kDa hERG channels (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) and that UbKO preferentially associated with hERG channels under low K+ conditions in the presence of lactacystin (Fig. 6). Ub can polymerize by binding to other Ub molecules at lysine residues (37Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar); UbKO has all lysine residues mutated to arginine residues and can only support monoubiquitination. Hence, UbKO is a useful tool in evaluating monoubiquitin modification of cargo proteins (24Lim K.L. Chew K.C. Tan J.M. Wang C. Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Tanaka Y. Smith W. Engelender S. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2002-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 25Zhou R. Patel S.V. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20207-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Numerous cellular proteins are post-translationally modified by the addition of the small modifier protein Ub for maintaining cellular health. Whereas polyubiquitination usually leads to proteasomal degradation of various cellular proteins, monoubiquitination regulates endocytic degradation of membrane receptors in lysosomes (9Haglund K. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 598-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 10Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The monoubiquitination-controlled attenuation of the receptor-mediated signaling pathways plays a central role in maintaining signaling homeostasis. For example, epidermal growth factor receptor, the epithelial sodium channel, the inward rectifier potassium channel ROMK1, and receptor tyrosine kinases are all monoubiquitinated, and monoubiquitin acts as a signal for internalization of targeted proteins through sorting in MVBs for lysosomal degradation (9Haglund K. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 598-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 28Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21323-21326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). MVBs are formed when segments of the endosomal membrane endocytose and become vesicles within a larger endosomal body. ESCRT-I first binds both Ub and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and initiates the sorting mechanism (37Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). ESCRT-II then brings ESCRT-III to the desired site on the endosomal membrane where they sequester the MVB cargo (37Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The morphological changes in the intraluminal vesicles reflect the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo toward them (31Wollert T. Wunder C. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2009; 458: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Vps24 is an important member of ESCRT-III required for cargo protein sorting. As shown in Fig. 5, hVps24 is involved in the degradation of mature hERG channels in low K+ conditions. Overexpression of hVps24 enhanced the 155-kDa hERG degradation in low K+, whereas knockdown of hVps24 impeded this process. The hVps24 protein displays predominantly plasma membrane and vesicular localization consistent with its role in the formation of MVBs (32Muzioł T. Pineda-Molina E. Ravelli R.B. Zamborlini A. Usami Y. Göttlinger H. Weissenhorn W. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our data also showed that internalized hERG channels colocalized with the hVps24 protein, a marker protein of MVBs (Fig. 4). Because hVps24 is involved in the MVB sorting of internalized cargo proteins, depletion of hVps24 obstructs hERG sorting in MVBs, leading to an accumulation of internalized hERG channels in endosomes. Such accumulation may impede hERG endocytosis through either an increased endosome recycling to the plasma membrane or an unknown feedback mechanism.Because UbKO is a chain elongation-defective Ub mutant, it causes premature termination of polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 2C) and only supports monoubiquitination of target proteins (24Lim K.L. Chew K.C. Tan J.M. Wang C. Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Tanaka Y. Smith W. Engelender S. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2002-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 25Zhou R. Patel S.V. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20207-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Our data showed that UbKO expression significantly accelerated low K+-induced endocytic degradation of the mature hERG channels (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Thus, polyubiquitination may not play a decisive role in low K+-induced hERG internalization. On the other hand, low K+-induced hERG internalization can be impeded by the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7) as well as MG132 (data not shown). The exact mechanisms for proteasomal activity in the MVB/lysosomal degradation of hERG channels under low K+ conditions warrant further investigation and may be related to the fact that proteasomal activity is required for the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo proteins in MVBs (38Hurley J.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our data demonstrated that lactacystin not only prevented 155-kDa hERG degradation but also shifted the 155-kDa hERG band toward a slightly higher molecular mass (Fig. 6A), suggesting that mature hERG channels are monoubiquitinated in the presence of lactacystin. Indeed, our co-IP data revealed that lactacystin-preserved hERG channels are monoubiquitinated (Figs. 2C and 6B). We propose that monoubiquitination triggers internalization of hERG channels, and deubiquitination is subsequently required for hERG sorting and degradation in MVBs/lysosomes (Fig. 9). The fact that lactacystin impedes degradation of mature hERG channels that are ubiquitinated raised a possibility that, as a proteasomal inhibitor, lactacystin inhibits hERG degradation in the MVB/lysosomal pathway by preventing deubiquitination of hERG channels. Previously, proteasomal activity has also been shown to be required for degradation of a number of membrane proteins that are internalized via the ubiquitination/MVB/lysosome pathway. These membrane proteins include glutamate receptors (16Patrick G.N. Bingol B. Weld H.A. Schuman E.M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2073-2081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), tropomyosin-regulated kinase A receptor (39Geetha T. Wooten M.W. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), growth hormone receptor (40van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), chloride channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (41Gentzsch M. Chang X.B. Cui L.

Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to investigate the role of deubiquitination in the degradation of these membrane proteins.Our data obtained using Western blot (Fig. 6) and confocal analysis (Fig. 7) further demonstrated that internalized hERG was not ubiquitinated when it reached lysosomes in the presence of lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1. These data strongly suggested that deubiquitination occurs downstream of hERG sorting and degradation. Our data on the deubiquitination enzyme STAMBP directly support this notion (Fig. 8) and suggest that the monoubiquitinated and internalized 155-kDa hERG is subsequently deubiquitinated between early endosomes and lysosomes, i.e. during MVB sorting. Thus, Ub molecules are released from mature hERG channels prior to their delivery to lysosomes for degradation. Because STAMBP-mediated deubiquitination of mature hERG is likely to occur at a late stage of endocytosis during cargo sorting in MVBs where STAMBP is recruited by the ubiquitinated cargo, STAMBP does not counteract the early step of monoubiquitination of cell surface hERG channels induced by low K+ exposure. Deubiquitination plays a similar role in endocytosis of protease-activated receptor 2 (43Hasdemir B. Murphy J.E. Cottrell G.S. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28453-28466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In short, our data showed that monoubiquitination at the earlier stages of the pathway directs the mature hERG channel for MVB sorting, and the internalized mature hERG channel is ultimately in a deubiquitinated state when it reaches lysosomes.Endocytosis represents one of the most essential processes for cell function. We previously showed that extracellular K+ is a prerequisite for hERG function and membrane stability; under low K+ conditions, cell surface hERG channels enter into a non-conducting state, reflecting a conformational change of the channel. This conformational change may cause the channel to be tagged by Ub, which triggers the channel internalization through a caveolin-dependent endocytic pathway (8Massaeli H. Sun T. Li X. Shallow H. Wu J. Xu J. Li W. Hanson C. Guo J. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27259-27264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our present study indicates that attachment of a single Ub moiety is sufficient to trigger internalization of cell surface hERG channels; the internalized mature hERG channels are sorted by the ESCRT in MVBs and undergo deubiquitination prior to entry into lysosomes for degradation.In summary, we have demonstrated that the cell surface voltage-gated potassium channel hERG is internalized and degraded through a monoubiquitination/MVB sorting pathway in a dynamic manner under low K+ conditions. This finding extends our understanding of ion channel regulation and endocytic degradation of plasma membrane proteins.

Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). IKr is important for cardiac repolarization, and its reduction causes long QT syndrome (LQTS), a disorder that predisposes individuals to life-threatening arrhythmias (3Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M. Nature. 2006; 440: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Mutations in hERG cause type 2 inherited long QT syndrome (LQT2), and a diverse variety of medications can block hERG and cause acquired LQTS as a cardiac side effect (4Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In addition, a reduction in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) exacerbates LQTS (5Roden D.M. Woosley R.L. Primm R.K. Am. Heart J. 1986; 111: 1088-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Using an in vivo rabbit model, we previously demonstrated that hypokalemia chronically reduces IKr and prolongs the action potential duration and the QT intervals of electrocardiograms. We further showed that extracellular K+ (K+o) is required for hERG function and membrane stability; upon depletion of K+o, hERG channels enter into a non-conducting state within minutes and are subsequently internalized and degraded within hours (6Guo J.

Res. 2010; 106: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated an involvement of caveolin in low K+-induced internalization of cell surface hERG channels (8Massaeli H. Sun T. Li X. Shallow H. Wu J. Xu J. Li W. Hanson C. Guo J. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27259-27264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the cellular machinery for hERG endocytic degradation is largely unknown. In particular, although ubiquitin (Ub) is found to be involved in the internalization of cell surface hERG channels (6Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Investig. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Massaeli H. Guo J. Xu J. Zhang S. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the nature of Ub-hERG interactions is not known.Ub is a protein with a highly conserved sequence of 76 amino acids found in every eukaryotic cell. The covalent binding of Ub to target proteins is known as ubiquitination, a process well known for labeling proteins for degradation (9Haglund K. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 598-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 10Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Appendage of a single Ub moiety leads to monoubiquitination, whereas attachment of a chain of Ub leads to polyubiquitination. Although polyubiquitination targets proteins for proteasomal degradation (11Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), monoubiquitination targets membrane proteins for internalization and lysosomal degradation. As an internalization signal of membrane proteins, monoubiquitination is well described in yeast (12Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R.

The elongation factors TFIIF and TFIIS have been shown to cooperate in maintaining pol II in the catalytically competent state on pure DNA templates. We now show that although TFIIF or TFIIS alone is modestly stimulatory for nucleosome traversal, both factors together increase transcription through nucleosomes in a synergistic manner. We also studied the effect of TFIIF and TFIIS on transcription of nucleosomes containing a Sin mutant histone. The Sin point mutations reduce critical histone-DNA contacts near the center of the nucleosome. Significantly, we found that nucleosomes with a Sin mutant histone are traversed to the same extent and at nearly the same rate as equivalent pure DNA templates if both TFIIS and TFIIF are present. Thus, the nucleosome is not necessarily an insurmountable barrier to transcript elongation by pol II. If unfolding of template DNA from the nucleosome surface is facilitated and the tendency of pol II to retreat from barriers is countered, transcription of nucleosomal templates can be rapid and efficient.

It is now appreciated that control of transcript elongation is an important aspect of gene regulation (recently reviewed in Ref. 1Saunders A. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). A major checkpoint occurs as RNA polymerase II (pol II) 2The abbreviations used are pol II, RNA polymerase II; EC, elongation complex. passes from initiation into productive transcript elongation, ∼50 bp downstream of the transcription start site in many genes (2Core L.J.

This checkpoint is roughly coincident with the initial contact between pol II and the first nucleosome of the transcription unit (7Schones D.E. Cui K. Cuddapah S. Roh T.Y. Barski A. Wang Z. Wei G. Zhao K. Cell. 2008; 132: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 8Seila A.C. Calabrese J.M. Levine S.S. Yeo G.W. Rahl P.B. Flynn R.A. Young R.A. Sharp P.A.

Once pol II crosses this initial checkpoint, it can elongate transcripts efficiently over hundreds of kilobases of predominantly nucleosomal template (10Singh J. Padgett R.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1128-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The rate of transcript elongation in vivo (10Singh J. Padgett R.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1128-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) slightly exceeds the maximum rates reported for transcript elongation by pol II on pure DNA templates in vitro (11Izban M.G.

To understand both the initial elongation checkpoint and the exceptional efficiency of transcript elongation downstream of that point, it is essential to develop in vitro systems that duplicate these processes. Progress toward this goal has been somewhat limited because even single nucleosomes have generally proven to be strong barriers to transcribing pol II in vitro (11Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 2005; 18: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Given the tight association of all 146 bp of nucleosomal DNA with the histone octamer surface, one might initially imagine that the nucleosome presents an essentially continuous barrier to transcript elongation by pol II. However, studies with templates bearing single, precisely positioned nucleosomes indicated that the transcriptional barrier for pol II is more discrete. The strongest pauses for human pol II typically occur 45–55 bp within the nucleosome. After pol II crosses this barrier and the nucleosome dyad, transcription continues largely uninhibited through the remainder of the nucleosome (13Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I. Polikanov Y.S. Luse D.S. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This suggests that traversal is controlled primarily by the unfolding of the template DNA from the octamer surface as pol II enters the central segment of the nucleosome organized by the histone H3/H4 tetramer (see Ref. 18Kulaeva O.I. Gaykalova D.A. Pestov N.A. Golovastov V.V. Vassylyev D.G. Artsimovitch I. Studitsky V.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the results of recent studies on the transcription of nucleosomes that were altered to facilitate template unfolding. The two strongest protein-DNA contacts in the nucleosome immediately flank the nucleosome dyad (19Hall M.A. Shundrovsky A. Bai L. Fulbright R.M. Lis J.T. Wang M.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These contacts are specifically disrupted by point mutations in histone H3 or H4 called Sin mutants (20Muthurajan U.M. Bao Y. Forsberg L.J. Edayathumangalam R.S. Dyer P.N. White C.L. Luger K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that nucleosomes containing Sin mutant histones do provide a significantly lower barrier to nucleosome traversal by pol II (21Hsieh F.K. Fisher M. Újvári A. Studitsky V.M. Luse D.S. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Single-nucleosome unfolding studies have demonstrated that removal of the N-terminal tail domains from histones H2A and H2B specifically favors DNA unwrapping 45–55 bp within the nucleosome (22Brower-Toland B. Wacker D.A. Fulbright R.M. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Wang M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We have also shown that overall nucleosome traversal by human pol II is increased and that the +45 barrier in particular is decreased with nucleosomes lacking the H2A/H2B tails (23Újvári A. Hsieh F.K. Luse S.W. Studitsky V.M. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32236-32243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These alterations in nucleosome structure are not exact analogs of the events in the nuclei of higher eukaryotes that control transcript elongation. However, results with nucleosomes containing Sin mutant or tailless histones do demonstrate directly that targeted unfolding of DNA from the octamer surface has the potential to play a major role in effective transcript elongation in vivo. Although facilitating unfolding of critical histone-DNA contacts clearly improves transcription through nucleosomes by pol II, traversal in the in vitro studies just cited remained incomplete and slow relative to transcription of pure DNA templates (21Hsieh F.K. Fisher M. Újvári A. Studitsky V.M. Luse D.S. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Újvári A. Hsieh F.K. Luse S.W. Studitsky V.M. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32236-32243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is known that pol II backtracks along the template when it encounters transcriptional barriers, including arrest sites on pure DNA templates (24Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2005; 18: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, effective nucleosome traversal is likely to require factors that hold pol II in the transcriptionally competent configuration. TFIIS, which drives transcript cleavage in backtracked complexes to realign the active site and the 3′-end of the RNA (26Reines D. Ghanouni P. Li Q.Q. Mote Jr., J. J. Biol.

Cell. 2006; 125: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, even at saturating levels of TFIIS and long incubation times, traversal of single nucleosomes remains incomplete (23Újvári A. Hsieh F.K. Luse S.W. Studitsky V.M. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32236-32243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A potential solution is suggested by the work of Burton and co-workers (30Zhang C. Yan H. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50101-50111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), who showed in single-bond formation assays on pure DNA templates that the initiation and elongation factor TFIIF acts synergistically with TFIIS to maintain pol II in the catalytically competent state. This finding predicts that the combined action of these factors should provide a significant increase in the ability of pol II to transcribe nucleosomal templates. Both TFIIS (28Kim J. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2010; 140: 491-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and TFIIF (31Cojocaru M. Jeronimo C. Forget D. Bouchard A. Bergeron D. Côte P. Poirier G.G.

Biol. 2010; 20: 548-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have been shown to associate with pol II across transcribed regions in mammalian cells, so it is reasonable to suppose that they participate in facilitating nucleosome traversal in the cell. Here, we show that although TFIIS and TFIIF are stimulatory on their own in facilitating nucleosome traversal, these factors clearly cooperate in supporting transcription through nucleosomes by pol II. Importantly, when template unfolding is facilitated by the presence of a Sin mutant histone, the combination of TFIIS and TFIIF allows pol II to traverse nucleosomes efficiently and at rates approaching those seen on pure DNA templates. The human general transcription factors TATA-binding protein, TFIIB, and TFIIE were recombinant proteins prepared as described (33Újvári A. Luse D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The Sin mutant H3 has a substitution of isoleucine for threonine at position 118. DNA templates were composed of the adenovirus major late promoter upstream and either the 603 or 603R assembly element downstream (13Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I.

Working templates were prepared by PCR amplification with the upstream primer biotinylated. Templates were reconstituted into nucleosomes by decreasing salt dialysis. Nucleosome assembly was verified by native gel electrophoresis; typically, only 1–3% of free DNA was detected. For the experiments in Fig. 5, templates were deliberately under-reconstituted, leaving ∼25% free DNA. Nucleosomal templates were bound to streptavidin beads and assembled into preinitiation complexes by incubation with human pol II and the general transcript initiation factors as described (13Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I. Polikanov Y.S. Luse D.S. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Transcription was initiated with 250 μm CpA, 100 μm UTP, 0.7 μm [α-32P]CTP, and 50 μm dATP at 30 °C for 1 min to generate primarily complexes with 21-mer RNAs (EC21). These complexes were then washed successively with 100 mm KCl and 40 mm KCl. For all reactions except those in supplemental Fig. S4, EC21 complexes were chased for 15–300 s with all four NTPs (1 mm) at 30 °C as indicated in the figures; reactions were terminated by pipetting into phenol-CHCl3. The reactions in supplemental Fig. S4 used 100 or 250 μm NTPs as indicated; all other parameters were the same as in the other figures. Elongation factors (TFIIS, 24 μg/ml; and/or TFIIF, 2 μg/ml) were added along with the NTPs as indicated in the figures. Sarkosyl was added where indicated to a final concentration of 1% prior to the addition of the chase NTPs. The concentration of KCl in all the chase reactions was adjusted to 58 mm to compensate for KCl added with the elongation factors. For the experiment in Fig. 5, templates were radiolabeled at the downstream end. EC21 complexes were synthesized with non-radiolabeled NTPs only and were immediately digested with DraI at 30 °C for 5 min. Reactions for each lane contained 10 ng of template plus 8 units of DraI at a final concentration of 0.8 units/μl. After exchanging the buffer to 100 mm KCl, digestion was continued at 30 °C with 20 units of StyI at a final concentration of 0.8 units/μl for 5 min. Complexes were washed twice with 100 mm KCl buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and once with 40 mm KCl buffer. Supernatants from the two digestions and all subsequent washes were saved and combined. Buffer or α-amanitin (final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml) was added, followed by TFIIF, TFIIS, and 1 mm NTPs at a final salt concentration of 58 mm KCl as in the other figures. Incubation was continued at 30 °C for 5 min. For the indicated samples, 6.25 units of ClaI was added to a final concentration of 0.2 units/μl; all samples were then incubated at 30 °C for a further 5 min. All reactions were terminated by the addition of phenol-CHCl3. In all cases, labeled RNAs or DNAs were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing gels and quantified using a STORM Imager and ImageQuant software. We analyzed the ability of human pol II to transcribe DNA wrapped on the surface of a single, precisely positioned nucleosome. The 255 bp templates consisted of 106 bp promoter segments upstream of 149 bp nucleosome positioning elements. Nucleosomes were reconstituted by salt dialysis, and the nucleosomal templates were attached to beads at the upstream end. Preinitiation complexes were then assembled using purified human pol II and purified or recombinant transcript initiation factors. Transcripts were pulse-labeled to generate complexes with predominantly 21-nucleotide RNAs (EC21). Following rinsing to remove unincorporated label, transcription complexes were chased into the nucleosome with excess non-labeled NTPs. In this study, we focused on the 603 positioning sequence, which directs nucleosome assembly with base pair accuracy (40Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). We showed previously that nucleosomes reconstituted on the 603 sequence provide a much stronger barrier to transcription when read in one of the two possible orientations. We designated the less permissive orientation 603R and the more permissive orientation 603 (13Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I. Polikanov Y.S. Luse D.S. Studitsky V.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As expected from previous work (13Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A. Kulaeva O.I.

Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32236-32243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), 603R nucleosomes assembled with wild-type histones provided a very strong barrier to pol II. After a 5-min chase, only ∼10% of polymerases reached the end of the template (Fig. 1, A, lanes 1–7, and B). Most of the 603R barrier was concentrated at a closely spaced series of pause sites 45–55 bp within the nucleosome. This barrier resulted from the nucleosome because the addition of Sarkosyl (which removes the nucleosome from DNA) eliminated the barrier (Fig. 1A, lanes 29–35). We tested whether the elongation factors TFIIS and TFIIF could significantly improve transcript elongation by pol II through the 603R nucleosome. The amount of each factor added was saturating as determined by initial titrations on the 603R nucleosomal template. Each factor individually increased traversal by ∼2-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). When we plotted the time required for the maximum level of run-off transcript to appear for each reaction, it was clear that the rate at which run-off transcript accumulated increased with TFIIF but not with TFIIS (Fig. 1C). This is consistent with the known effects of these factors reported previously for transcript elongation on pure DNA templates (11Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In supplemental Fig. S1, we reproduced this finding with the template and factor preparations used in this study. Significantly, the combination of TFIIF and TFIIS greatly improved traversal as compared with the addition of either factor alone (Fig. 1A, lanes 22–28). The amount of run-off roughly doubled (Fig. 1B), whereas the rate at which run-off accumulated was the same as seen with TFIIF alone (Fig. 1C). This agreed with our initial hypothesis that TFIIF and TFIIS should cooperate in facilitating transcript elongation on nucleosomal templates. To confirm that the effect of the elongation factors was not somehow confined to the relatively nonpermissive 603R template, we repeated the Fig. 1 experiment with nucleosomes assembled on the 603 sequence. In the absence of factors, traversal was considerably higher on the 603 template as compared with 603R (supplemental Fig. S2, A, lanes 1–7, and B). As we observed with 603R nucleosomes, both TFIIF and TFIIS increased traversal on the 603 template. The two factors combined to stimulate both the level and the rate of traversal. Although TFIIS alone did not eliminate the strong +45 barrier on the 603R nucleosome, on the less restrictive 603 template, TFIIS strongly diminished the central pauses within the nucleosome, particularly in cooperation with TFIIF (supplemental Fig. S2A, compare lanes 7, 14, and 28). A single amino acid variant of histone H3, the Sin mutant T118I, relieves the requirement of chromatin remodelers for expression of certain genes in yeast (41Kruger W. Peterson C.L. Sil A. Coburn C. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2770-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes bearing Sin mutant versions of H3 or H4 are less stable and more mobile along the DNA in thermal shift experiments (20Muthurajan U.M. Bao Y. Forsberg L.J. Edayathumangalam R.S. Dyer P.N. White C.L. Luger K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In agreement with our recent findings (21Hsieh F.K. Fisher M. Újvári A. Studitsky V.M. Luse D.S. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), substitution of H3 T118I for wild-type H3 considerably reduced the traversal barrier imposed by the 603R nucleosome (Figs. 1A and 2A, compare lanes 1–7). Both TFIIF and TFIIS increased traversal of the Sin mutant nucleosome. The overall effects of the factors were generally similar to those shown in Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2. On the H3 T118I-containing template, traversal levels were maximal with TFIIS alone, although the rate of traversal in the presence of TFIIS was stimulated by TFIIF. Note in particular that with both factors, the major +45 barrier was almost completely eliminated (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 7, 14, and 28). A similar overall result was seen with an H3 T118I-containing nucleosome assembled on the 603 template (Fig. 3). The results in Fig. 3 provide an especially clear picture of the differing roles of the two elongation factors. TFIIF increased the rate at which run-off appeared, but all major pause sites were still occupied, even at the longest time points (Fig. 3A, lanes 15–21). TFIIS strongly reduced all of the pauses, but the most effective pause reduction and relatively rapid read-through required TFIIF in addition to TFIIS (Fig. 3A, lanes 8–14 and 22–28).FIGURE 3Traversal of a 603 nucleosome containing an H3 Sin mutant histone is efficient in the presence of TFIIF and TFIIS. A, same as in Fig. 2, except that the 603 nucleosome assembly sequence was used instead of 603R. On this template, there is a major pause 15 bp within the nucleosome (+15), which is indicated to left of the nucleosome (oval) in A. B and C, same as in Fig. 1, except that three repeats were done.

Wacker D.A. Fulbright R.M. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Wang M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our earlier work (21Hsieh F.K. Fisher M. Újvári A. Studitsky V.M. Luse D.S. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that incorporation of tailless H2A and H2B along with a Sin mutant histone provides an additive increase in nucleosome traversal by human pol II. As shown in supplemental Fig. S3, a histone octamer assembled on the 603R template with tailless H2A/H2B and H3 T118I allowed considerable pol II traversal even in the absence of factors. The addition of either TFIIF or TFIIS stimulated traversal, but the result with both factors together was especially striking: the nucleosomal barrier was essentially eliminated in that case (supplemental Fig. S3, lanes 22–28). The results in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 and supplemental Fig. S3 suggest an additional question: if the nucleosomal pause sites are nearly eliminated on these templates in the presence of both TFIIF and TFIIS, is transcript elongation through the nucleosome under these conditions equivalent to that seen on free DNA? Fig. 4 shows the results of transcript elongation in the presence of TFIIF and TFIIS on 603R DNA and a 603R nucleosome containing H3 T118I. The efficiency of run-off production was essentially equivalent for nucleosomal and pure DNA templates in this experiment, but even in the presence of saturating elongation factors, some slight pausing was still seen on the nucleosome at the major pause sites near +45. Thus, the traversal rate on the nucleosome was on average about half that on free DNA under these conditions. This represents, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that pol II can achieve full traversal of nucleosomes in a defined biochemical system at rates comparable to those obtained on pure DNA templates. It is important to note that nucleosomes assembled on the 603R sequence are the least permissive for traversal of any we have tested (13Bondarenko V.A. Steele L.M. Újvári A. Gaykalova D.A.

However, the mechanism by which t-UTPs function in pre-rRNA transcription remains undetermined. In the present study, we identified hALP, a histone acetyl-transferase as a novel t-UTP. We first showed that hALP is nucleolar, and is associated with U3 snoRNA and required for 18 S rRNA processing. Moreover, depletion of hALP resulted in a decreased level of 47 S pre-rRNA. Ectopic expression of hALP activated the rDNA promoter luciferase reporter and knockdown of hALP inhibited the reporter. In addition, hALP bound rDNA. Taken together these data identify hALP as a novel t-UTP. Immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown experiments showed that hALP binds the upstream binding factor (UBF) in vivo and in vitro. It is of importance that hALP acetylated UBF depending on HAT in vivo, and hALP but not hALP (ΔHAT) facilitated the nuclear translocation of the RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-associated factor 53 (PAF53) from the cytoplasm and promoted the association of UBF with PAF53. Thus, we provide a mechanism in which a novel t-UTP activates Pol I transcription by binding and acetylating UBF."

In this work, monomeric CYP3A4 solubilized in Nanodiscs has been studied for its ability to interact with varying molar ratios of ANF and TST. Comparison of the observed heme spin state, NADPH consumption, and product formation rates with a non-cooperative model calculated from a linear combination of the global analysis of each substrate reveals a detailed landscape of the heterotropic interactions and indicates negligible binding cooperativity between ANF and TST. The observed effect of ANF on the kinetics of TST metabolism is due to the additive action of the second substrate with no specific allosteric effects."

Mutations in the Wnt receptor FZD4 gene have been confirmed to cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). FEVR is characterized by incomplete vascularization of the peripheral retina, which can lead to vitreous bleeding, tractional retinal detachment, and blindness. We screened for mutations in the FZD4 gene in five families with FEVR and identified five mutations (C45Y, Y58C, W226X, C204R, and W496X), including three novel mutations (C45Y, Y58C, and W226X). In the retina, Norrin serves as a ligand and binds to FZD4 to activate the Wnt signaling pathway in normal angiogenesis and vascularization. The cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FZD4 has been shown to play a critical role in Norrin-FZD4 binding. We investigated the effect of mutations in the FZD4 CRD in Norrin binding and signaling in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type and mutant FZD4 proteins were assayed for Norrin binding and Norrin-dependent activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by cell-surface and overlay binding assays and luciferase reporter assays. In HEK293 transfection studies, C45Y, Y58C, and C204R mutants did not bind to Norrin and failed to transduce FZD4-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In vivo studies using Xenopus embryos showed that these FZD4 mutations disrupt Norrin/β-catenin signaling as evidenced by decreased Siamois and Xnr3 expression. This study identified a new class of FZD4 gene mutations in human disease and demonstrates a critical role of the CRD in Norrin binding and activation of the β-catenin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2006958416,"Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that effluxes drugs and organic anions across the plasma membrane. The 17 transmembrane helices of MRP1 are linked by extracellular and cytoplasmic loops (CLs), but their role in coupling the ATPase activity of MRP1 to the translocation of its substrates is poorly understood. Here we have examined the importance of CL5 by mutating eight conserved charged residues and the helix-disrupting Gly(511) in this region. Ala substitution of Lys(513), Lys(516), Glu(521), and Glu(535) markedly reduced MRP1 levels. Because three of these residues are predicted to lie at the interface of CL5 and the second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2), a critical role is indicated for this region in the plasma membrane expression of MRP1. Further support for this idea was obtained by mutating NBD2 amino acids His(1364) and Arg(1367) at the CL5 interface, which also resulted in reduced MRP1 levels. In contrast, mutation of Arg(501), Lys(503), Glu(507), Arg(532), and Gly(511) had no effect on MRP1 levels. Except for K503A, however, transport by these mutants was reduced by 50 to 75%, an effect largely attributable to reduced substrate binding and affinity. Studies with (32)P-labeled azido-ATP also indicated that whereas ATP binding by the G511I mutant was unchanged, vanadate-induced trapping of azido-ADP was reduced, indicating changes in the catalytic activity of MRP1. Together, these data demonstrate the multiple roles for CL5 in the membrane expression and function of MRP1."

Human lysosomal αGNase is well known to degrade heparin and heparan sulfate. Here, we reveal the substrate specificity of αGNase (AgnC) from Clostridium perfringens strain 13, a bacterial homolog of human αGNase, by chemically synthesizing a series of disaccharide substrates containing α-linked GlcNAc. AgnC was found to release GlcNAc from GlcNAcα1,4Galβ1pMP and GlcNAcα1pNP substrates (where pMP and pNP represent p-methoxyphenyl and p-nitrophenyl, respectively).

Deletion of the C-terminal region containing several carbohydrate-binding module 32 (CBM32) domains significantly reduced the activity for porcine gastric mucin; however, activity against GlcNAcα1,4Galβ1pMP was markedly enhanced. Dot blot and ELISA analyses revealed that the deletion construct containing the C-terminal CBM-C2 to CBM-C6 domains binds strongly to porcine gastric mucin. Consequently, tandem CBM32 domains located near the C terminus of AgnC should function by increasing the affinity for branched or clustered α-GlcNAc-containing glycans.

https://openalex.org/W2093532264,"Previous studies suggested that the zinc-responsive Zap1 transcriptional activator directly regulates the expression of over 80 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Many of these genes play key roles to enhance the ability of yeast cells to grow under zinc-limiting conditions. Zap1 is unusual among transcriptional activators in that it contains two activation domains, designated AD1 and AD2, which are regulated independently by zinc. These two domains are evolutionarily conserved among Zap1 orthologs suggesting that they are both important for Zap1 function. In this study, we have examined the roles of AD1 and AD2 in low zinc growth and the regulation of Zap1 target gene expression. Using alleles that are specifically disrupted for either AD1 or AD2 function, we found that these domains are not redundant, and both are important for normal growth in low zinc. AD1 plays the primary role in zinc-responsive gene regulation, whereas AD2 is required for maximal expression of only a few target promoters. AD1 alone is capable of driving full expression of most Zap1 target genes and dictates the kinetics of Zap1 gene induction in response to zinc withdrawal. Surprisingly, we found that AD1 is less active in zinc-limited cells under heat stress and AD2 plays a more important role under those conditions. These results suggest that AD2 may contribute more to Zap1 function when zinc deficiency is combined with other environmental stresses. In the course of these studies, we also found that the heat shock response is induced under conditions of severe zinc deficiency.

In this study, we have examined the roles of AD1 and AD2 in low zinc growth and the regulation of Zap1 target gene expression. Using alleles that are specifically disrupted for either AD1 or AD2 function, we found that these domains are not redundant, and both are important for normal growth in low zinc. AD1 plays the primary role in zinc-responsive gene regulation, whereas AD2 is required for maximal expression of only a few target promoters. AD1 alone is capable of driving full expression of most Zap1 target genes and dictates the kinetics of Zap1 gene induction in response to zinc withdrawal. Surprisingly, we found that AD1 is less active in zinc-limited cells under heat stress and AD2 plays a more important role under those conditions. These results suggest that AD2 may contribute more to Zap1 function when zinc deficiency is combined with other environmental stresses. In the course of these studies, we also found that the heat shock response is induced under conditions of severe zinc deficiency."

In mammals, Klotho and beta-Klotho are type 1 transmembrane proteins that function as obligatory co-factors for endocrine FGFs to bind to their cognate FGF receptors (FGFRs). Mutations in Klotho/beta-Klotho or fgf19, -21, or -23 are associated with a number of human diseases, including autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, premature aging disorders, and diabetes. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome contains two paralogues of Klotho/beta-Klotho, klo-1, and klo-2. klo-1 is expressed in the C. elegans excretory canal, which is structurally and functionally paralogous to the vertebrate kidney. KLO-1 associates with EGL-15/FGFR, suggesting a role for KLO-1 in the fluid homeostasis phenotype described previously for egl-15/fgfr mutants. Altered levels of EGL-15/FGFR signaling lead to defects in excretory canal development and function in C. elegans. These results suggest an evolutionarily conserved function for the FGFR-Klotho complex in the development of excretory organs such as the mammalian kidney and the worm excretory canal. These results also suggest an evolutionarily conserved function for the FGFR-Klotho axis in metabolic regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2023020380,"Envenoming by the contact of human skin with Lonomia obliqua caterpillars promotes a hemorrhagic syndrome characterized by a consumptive coagulopathy. Losac (Lonomia obliqua Stuart factor activator) is a component of the bristle of L. obliqua that is probably partially responsible for the observed syndrome because it activates factor X and is recognized by an effective antilonomic serum. Here we unveil the proteolytic activity of Losac and demonstrate the feasibility of its recombinant production. On the other hand, Losac has no homology to known proteases, but it can be inhibited by PMSF, a serine protease inhibitor. Instead, it shows closer homology to members of the hemolin family of proteins, a group of cell adhesion molecules. The recombinant protein (rLosac) shortened the coagulation time of normal and deficient plasmas, whereas it was ineffective in factor X-deficient plasma unless reconstituted with this protein. rLosac was able to activate factor X in a dose- and time-dependent manner but not γ-carboxyglutamic acid domainless factor X. Moreover, phospholipids and calcium ions increased rLosac activity. Also, rLosac had no effect on fibrin or fibrinogen, indicating its specificity for blood coagulation activation. Linear double reciprocal plots indicate that rLosac follows a Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Cleavage of factor X by rLosac resulted in fragments that are compatible with those generated by RVV-X (a well known factor X activator). Together, our results validate Losac as the first protein from the hemolin family exhibiting procoagulant activity through selective proteolysis on coagulation factor X."
https://openalex.org/W2030725344,"In yeast, the inositolphosphorylceramides mostly contain C26:0 fatty acids. Inositolphosphorylceramides were considered to be important for viability because the inositolphosphorylceramide synthase AUR1 is essential. However, lcb1Δ cells, unable to make sphingoid bases and inositolphosphorylceramides, are viable if they harbor SLC1-1, a gain of function mutation in the 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase SLC1. SLC1-1 allows the incorporation of C26:0 fatty acids into phosphatidylinositol (PI), thus generating PI″, an abnormal, C26-containing PI, presumably acting as surrogate for inositolphosphorylceramide. Here we show that the lethality of the simultaneous deletion of the known ceramide synthases LAG1/LAC1/LIP1 and YPC1/YDC1 can be rescued by the expression of SLC1-1 or the overexpression of AUR1. Moreover, lag1Δ lac1Δ ypc1Δ ydc1Δ (4Δ) quadruple mutants have been reported to be viable in certain genetic backgrounds but to still make some abnormal uncharacterized inositol-containing sphingolipids. Indeed, we find that 4Δ quadruple mutants make substantial amounts of unphysiological inositolphosphorylphytosphingosines but that they also still make small amounts of normal inositolphosphorylceramides. Moreover, 4Δ strains incorporate exogenously added sphingoid bases into inositolphosphorylceramides, indicating that these cells still possess an unknown pathway allowing the synthesis of ceramides. 4Δ cells also still add quite normal amounts of ceramides to glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors. Synthesis of inositolphosphorylceramides and inositolphosphorylphytosphingosines is operated by Aur1p and is essential for growth of all 4Δ cells unless they contain SLC1-1. PI″, however, is made without the help of Aur1p. Furthermore, mannosylation of PI″ is required for the survival of sphingolipid-deficient strains, which depend on SLC1-1. In contrast to lcb1Δ SLC1-1, 4Δ SLC1-1 cells grow at 37 °C but remain thermosensitive at 44 °C."
https://openalex.org/W2072997107,"GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase plays a key role in the generation of mannose 6-phosphate, a recognition marker essential for efficient transport of lysosomal hydrolases to lysosomes. The enzyme complex is composed of six subunits (α(2)β(2)γ(2)). The α- and β-subunits are catalytically active, whereas the function of the γ-subunit is still unclear. We have investigated structural properties, localization, and intracellular transport of the human and mouse γ-subunits and the molecular requirements for the assembly of the phosphotransferase complex. The results showed that endogenous and overexpressed γ-subunits were localized in the cis-Golgi apparatus. Secreted forms of γ-subunits were detectable in media of cultured cells as well as in human serum. The γ-subunit contains two in vivo used N-glycosylation sites at positions 88 and 115, equipped with high mannose-type oligosaccharides. (35)S pulse-chase experiments and size exclusion chromatography revealed that the majority of non-glycosylated γ-subunit mutants were integrated in high molecular mass complexes, failed to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and were rapidly degraded. The substitution of cysteine 245 involved in dimerization of γ-subunits impaired neither ER exit nor trafficking through the secretory pathway. Monomeric γ-subunits failed, however, to associate with other GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase subunits. The data provide evidence that assembly of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex takes place in the ER and requires dimerization of the γ-subunits."

Helices S5 and S6 form the ion-conducting pore, and helices S1-S4 function as the voltage sensor with helix S4 thought to be the essential element for voltage-dependent activation. Although the crystal structures have provided insight into voltage-gated K channels (K(V)s), revealing a characteristic domain arrangement in which the voltage sensor domain of one subunit is close to the pore domain of an adjacent subunit in the tetramer, the structural and functional information on Na(V)s remains limited. Here, we show that the domain arrangement in NaChBac, a firstly cloned prokaryotic Na(V), is similar to that in K(V)s. Cysteine substitutions of three residues in helix S4, Q107C, T110C, and R113C, effectively induced intersubunit disulfide bond formation with a cysteine introduced in helix S5, M164C, of the adjacent subunit. In addition, substituting two acidic residues with lysine, E43K and D60K, shifted the activation of the channel to more positive membrane potentials and consistently shifted the preferentially formed disulfide bond from T110C/M164C to Q107C/M164C. Because Gln-107 is located closer to the extracellular side of helix S4 than Thr-110, this finding suggests that the functional shift in the voltage dependence of activation is related to a restriction of the position of helix S4 in the lipid bilayer. The domain arrangement and vertical mobility of helix S4 in NaChBac indicate that the structure and the mechanism of voltage-dependent activation in prokaryotic Na(V)s are similar to those in canonical K(V)s."

McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar). Three hedgehog ligands exist in mammals, Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (2Lum L. Beachy P.A. Science. 2004; 304: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Shh is the best studied ligand in the hedgehog pathway, and it functions as a morphogen involved in the development of many organs such as the limb, external genitalia, neural tube, bone, craniofacial, tooth, and hair follicle (3Niswander L.

Shh binds to Patched1 (Ptch1), a 12-pass transmembrane protein, to activate signal transduction. In the absence of Shh, Patched1 inhibits Smoothened (Smo) and its downstream signaling cascades. Upon Shh binding, Patched1 releases its repression on Smo, which leads to activation of Gli transcription factors. Activated Glis translocate to the nucleus where they regulate downstream target gene expression (9Kovacs J.J. Hara M.R. Davenport C.L. Kim J. Lefkowitz R.J. Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 443-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). One of these targets is Ptch1, which upon induction generates a negative feedback loop to avoid sustained activation of this pathway. Both genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that Gli1 interacts directly with the Gli binding sites within the Ptch1 proximal promoter through its zinc finger domain (10Yoon J.W. Kita Y. Frank D.J.

However, how basal Ptch1 expression level is controlled in the absence of Shh signaling remains unclear.Among all zinc finger transcription factors in the mammalian genome, C2H2 zinc finger is the most common type of zinc finger that binds to DNA. C2H2 zinc finger motifs contain the consensus sequence YCX2–4CX3YX5YX2HX3,4H, where X represents any amino acid, and Y represents a hydrophobic residue (11Pabo C.O. Peisach E. Grant R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The two cysteines and histidines coordinate a zinc ion and fold the domain into a finger-like structure to interact with DNA (12Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 231Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Many zinc finger transcription factors contain multiple zinc fingers, and each zinc finger recognizes three nucleotides (13Miller J.C. Holmes M.C. Wang J. Guschin D.Y. Lee Y.L. Rupniewski I. Beausejour C.M. Waite A.J. Wang N.S. Kim K.A. Gregory P.D. Pabo C.O. Rebar E.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). However, not all zinc fingers bind to DNA at the same time, as post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins could interfere with their DNA binding capabilities.Of all the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, roughly one-third contain the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is only present in tetrapods (14Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). KRAB-containing C2H2 zinc finger proteins are involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and neoplastic transformation (15Jheon A.H. Ganss B. Cheifetz S. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18282-18289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Hennemann H. Vassen L. Geisen C. Eilers M. Möröy T. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 2004; 299: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The KRAB domain spans 50–75 amino acids and is further subdivided into KRAB A and B boxes. The KRAB A box is more conserved and plays a key role in transcription repression by binding to corepressors, whereas the B box plays a supportive role (18Vissing H. Meyer W.K. Aagaard L. Tommerup N. Thiesen H.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Corepressors for the KRAB zinc finger protein include Kap1, Tif1b, or Krip1 (19Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The current model suggests that KRAB zinc finger proteins bind to their cognitive DNA sequences, recruit co-repressors, and form a facultative heterochromatin environment with HDACs, HP1, and Setdb1 on target promoters to silence gene expression (12Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 231Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar).In this paper we demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized KRAB zinc finger protein ZNF431 directly represses Ptch1 expression by binding to three response elements in the Ptch1 1b promoter. This repression occurs both in MPLB cells and in Xenopus and mouse embryos. In addition, ZNF431 is also necessary for controlling basal Ptch1 expression as short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ZNF431 led to elevated Ptch1 expression in MPLB cells. Finally we show that Hh signaling response was decreased in ZNF431-overexpressing cells but elevated in ZNF431 knockdown cells. Together, these results implicate ZNF431 in controlling both Ptch1 basal expression and cellular response to Hh signaling.DISSCUSSIONMore than 350 KRAB C2H2 zinc finger protein family members have been identified both in mice and in humans, yet the biological function for most of these proteins remains unclear (34Ding G. Lorenz P. Kreutzer M. Li Y. Thiesen H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D267-D273Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Groner A.C. Meylan S. Ciuffi A. Zangger N. Ambrosini G. Dénervaud N. Bucher P. Trono D. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1000869Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The C2H2 Zinc fingers have been shown to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, and the KRAB domain represses DNA transcription (15Jheon A.H. Ganss B. Cheifetz S. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18282-18289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 36Bellefroid E.J. Lecocq P.J. Benhida A. Poncelet D.A. Belayew A. Martial J.A.

However, only a few in vivo targets have been identified for these proteins. In this study we characterized the mouse ZNF431, a C2H2 zinc finger protein with N-terminal KRAB domains and 15 tandem C2H2 zinc fingers at the C-terminus. We showed that ZNF431 is a nuclear transcriptional repressor and the N-terminal KRAB-A domain is required for this repressive activity through its association with HDAC1 and HDAC2. In addition, we identified Ptch1 as a direct transcriptional target for ZNF431 in MPLB cells. Three ZNF431 binding sites were identified in the mouse Ptch1 promoter with a consensus sequence of GCGCCC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that ZNF431 binds to these sites in vivo. We validated our cell culture findings both in Xenopus embryos and in transgenic mice showing that overexpression of ZNF431 during embryo development suppressed endogenous Ptch1 expression. Finally, we showed that ZNF431 expression level can affect cellular response to Hh stimulation. Together, these results implicate an important role for ZNF431 in Hh signal transduction.Like other KRAB C2H2 zinc finger proteins, ZNF431 represses gene transcription by binding to target promoters and likely first recruits HDAC2 and then HDAC1 to alter local chromatin structure. HDAC1 and -2 are components of two well studied repressive complexes, NuRD and Sin3A (38Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). At present, we do not know which repressive complex is responsible for interacting with ZNF431. Nonetheless, our data showed that the N-terminal ZNF431 KRAB A domain was absolutely required both for interaction with this complex as well as for transcription repression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this transcription repression was dependent on HDAC enzyme activity as TSA treatment partially relieved this repressive effect both on an artificial GAL4-responsive promoter and on the endogenous Ptch1 promoter (supplemental Fig. S13). Other than the N-terminal KRAB domain, ZNF431 contains 15 tandem zinc fingers. Based on crystallographic studies on other tandem zinc finger proteins, each zinc finger can interact with a 3-bp sequence through a one-to-one interaction between individual amino acids within the recognition helix to DNA bases (39Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Thus, tandem zinc finger proteins can theoretically increase their target specificity by adding more zinc fingers. However, not all zinc fingers in tandem bind DNA. Our EMSA results identify a 6-base pair consensus sequence of ZNF431, suggesting that only two zinc fingers are critical for DNA binding, whereas other zinc fingers may be functionally synergistic although structurally independent.We identified Ptch1 as one of the direct transcription targets of ZNF431. We showed that ZNF431 repressed Ptch1 expression both in MPLB cells and in Xenopus and mouse embryos. In MPLB cells only promoter 1b is active, and promoter analysis on the Ptch1 1b promoter revealed three ZNF431 binding sites. All three sites can bind to ZNF431 in an EMSA assay, and mutating all three sites is required to abolish ZNF431-mediated repression. In addition, mutating all three sites also elevated the basal activity of the Ptch1 1b promoter, suggesting that endogenous ZNF431 also regulates the 1b promoter through these sites. These ZNF431 binding sites do not overlap with the consensus Gli binding site located between −923 and −914, suggesting that the two zinc finger proteins regulate Ptch1 expression independently (32Agren M. Kogerman P. Kleman M.I. Wessling M. Toftgård R. Gene. 2004; 330: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the mouse embryo, global overexpression of ZNF431 leads to down-regulation of Ptch1 in all tissues where endogenous Ptch1 is expressed. The Ptch1 1b is the major isoform expressed in all tissues, and ZNF431 overexpression specifically down-regulated the 1b but not the 1a isoform (supplemental Fig. S14). However, given that ZNF431 also reduces Hh responsiveness in MPLB cells, we cannot exclude the possibility that reduced Hh signaling also contributes to the observed Ptch1 reduction in vivo. In Xenopus embryos, overexpression of the mouse ZNF431 could also repress Xptc1 expression. This implies that ZNF431 response element should also exist in the Xptc1 promoter. A search of the Xptc1 proximal promoter for ZNF431 binding sites revealed one consensus sequence (GCGCCC) at −315 relative to the transcription start site. Thus, it is possible that ZNF431 represses Xptc1 expression through binding to this site. These data suggest that ZNF431 function might be conserved in Xenopus; however, our effort to identify its homolog in Xenopus was hampered by an overwhelming number of putative homologous proteins in our blast search. In addition, the fact that presumably only 2 of the 15 zinc fingers may be responsible for binding to DNA makes it much more difficult to pinpoint a Xenopus homolog at this time. Nonetheless, the regulatory pathway between ZNF431 and Ptch1 appears to be conserved between Xenopus and mouse.If ZNF431 is a negative regulator of Ptch1 expression, the two genes should exhibit complementary patterns of expression. In general, ZNF431 expression was detected where Ptch1 was expressed. In a few places such as the developing tooth buds and vibrissa follicles, we observed stronger ZNF431 expression in the epithelial compartment compared with the mesenchyme, whereas Ptch1 was mainly expressed in the mesenchyme (supplemental Fig. S2) (40Goodrich L.V. Johnson R.L. Milenkovic L. McMahon J.A. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ZNF431 showed uniform expression in the developing neural tube, whereas Ptch1 exhibited a gradient expression. Thus, even though ZNF431 is a direct regulator of Ptch1 expression, it cannot be the sole transcriptional regulator governing Ptch1 basal expression.As Ptch1 is a direct target of Hh signaling and functions in a negative feedback loop to inhibit Hh signaling, reducing Ptch1 expression by ZNF431 overexpression should in theory increase Hh signaling. However, that is not the case. We observed that Hh responsiveness was also decreased upon ZNF431 overexpression and elevated upon ZNF431 knockdown. Consistently, expression of several components of Hh signaling cascade was suppressed by ZNF431. Moreover, when ZNF431 is overexpressed, these genes showed no response to Hh stimulation (supplemental Fig. S15). These results suggest that ZNF431 dampens Hh responsiveness by reducing Hh signal transduction, which may not be related to its repressive activity on Ptch1 expression. Together, our data indicate that ZNF431 protein represses both Ptch1 expression as well as the cellular response to Hh signaling. These results suggest that the normal function of ZNF431 may be to control Hh responsiveness within physiological range for signal transduction. IntroductionThe hedgehog (Hh) 2The abbreviations used are: Hh, hedgehog; Shh, Sonic hedgehog; Ptch1, Patched1; Smo, Smoothened; KRAB, Krüppel-associated box; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; DBD, DNA binding domain; HDAC, histone deacetylases; Xptc1, Xenopus ptch1; IP, immunoprecipitation; Ctrl, control; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. signaling pathway plays key roles both in embryonic development and during carcinogenesis (1Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar). Three hedgehog ligands exist in mammals, Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (2Lum L. Beachy P.A. Science. 2004; 304: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Shh is the best studied ligand in the hedgehog pathway, and it functions as a morphogen involved in the development of many organs such as the limb, external genitalia, neural tube, bone, craniofacial, tooth, and hair follicle (3Niswander L.

Shh binds to Patched1 (Ptch1), a 12-pass transmembrane protein, to activate signal transduction. In the absence of Shh, Patched1 inhibits Smoothened (Smo) and its downstream signaling cascades. Upon Shh binding, Patched1 releases its repression on Smo, which leads to activation of Gli transcription factors. Activated Glis translocate to the nucleus where they regulate downstream target gene expression (9Kovacs J.J. Hara M.R. Davenport C.L. Kim J. Lefkowitz R.J. Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 443-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). One of these targets is Ptch1, which upon induction generates a negative feedback loop to avoid sustained activation of this pathway. Both genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that Gli1 interacts directly with the Gli binding sites within the Ptch1 proximal promoter through its zinc finger domain (10Yoon J.W. Kita Y. Frank D.J. Majewski R.R. Konicek B.A. Nobrega M.A. Jacob H. Walterhouse D. Iannaccone P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5548-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, how basal Ptch1 expression level is controlled in the absence of Shh signaling remains unclear.Among all zinc finger transcription factors in the mammalian genome, C2H2 zinc finger is the most common type of zinc finger that binds to DNA. C2H2 zinc finger motifs contain the consensus sequence YCX2–4CX3YX5YX2HX3,4H, where X represents any amino acid, and Y represents a hydrophobic residue (11Pabo C.O. Peisach E. Grant R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The two cysteines and histidines coordinate a zinc ion and fold the domain into a finger-like structure to interact with DNA (12Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 231Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Many zinc finger transcription factors contain multiple zinc fingers, and each zinc finger recognizes three nucleotides (13Miller J.C. Holmes M.C. Wang J. Guschin D.Y. Lee Y.L. Rupniewski I. Beausejour C.M. Waite A.J. Wang N.S. Kim K.A. Gregory P.D. Pabo C.O. Rebar E.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). However, not all zinc fingers bind to DNA at the same time, as post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins could interfere with their DNA binding capabilities.Of all the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, roughly one-third contain the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is only present in tetrapods (14Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). KRAB-containing C2H2 zinc finger proteins are involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and neoplastic transformation (15Jheon A.H. Ganss B. Cheifetz S. Sodek J.

Cell Res. 2004; 299: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The KRAB domain spans 50–75 amino acids and is further subdivided into KRAB A and B boxes. The KRAB A box is more conserved and plays a key role in transcription repression by binding to corepressors, whereas the B box plays a supportive role (18Vissing H. Meyer W.K. Aagaard L. Tommerup N. Thiesen H.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Corepressors for the KRAB zinc finger protein include Kap1, Tif1b, or Krip1 (19Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The current model suggests that KRAB zinc finger proteins bind to their cognitive DNA sequences, recruit co-repressors, and form a facultative heterochromatin environment with HDACs, HP1, and Setdb1 on target promoters to silence gene expression (12Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 231Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar).In this paper we demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized KRAB zinc finger protein ZNF431 directly represses Ptch1 expression by binding to three response elements in the Ptch1 1b promoter. This repression occurs both in MPLB cells and in Xenopus and mouse embryos. In addition, ZNF431 is also necessary for controlling basal Ptch1 expression as short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ZNF431 led to elevated Ptch1 expression in MPLB cells. Finally we show that Hh signaling response was decreased in ZNF431-overexpressing cells but elevated in ZNF431 knockdown cells. Together, these results implicate ZNF431 in controlling both Ptch1 basal expression and cellular response to Hh signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2087363058,"Phytophagous insects do not constantly chew their diets; most of their time is spent in a non-feeding quiescent state even though they live on or around their diets. Following starvation, phytophagous insect larvae exhibit enhanced foraging behaviors such as nibbling and walking similar to the sequential behavior that occurs prior to each meal. Although extensive physiological studies have revealed regularly occurring feeding behaviors in phytophagous insects, little has been elucidated regarding the mechanism at the molecular level. Here, we report identification and characterization of a novel 62-amino acid peptide, designated as hemolymph major anionic peptide (HemaP), from the hemolymph of Bombyx mori larvae that induces foraging behaviors. The endogenous HemaP levels are significantly increased by diet deprivation, whereas refeeding after starvation returns them to basal levels. In larvae fed ad libitum, hemolymph HemaP levels fluctuate according to the feeding cycle, indicating that locomotor-associated feeding behaviors of B. mori larvae are initiated when HemaP levels exceed an unidentified threshold. Furthermore, administration of exogenous HemaP mimics the starvation-experienced state by affecting dopamine levels in the suboesophageal ganglion, which coordinates neck and mandible movements. These data strongly suggest that fluctuation of hemolymph HemaP levels modulates the regularly occurring feeding-motivated behavior in B. mori by triggering feeding initiation."

Here, we report a role of Wnt/Ca2+ signaling in regulating actin and growth cone dynamics. We found that treatment of cultured cortical neurons with Wnt5a, a non-canonical Wnt, either globally or locally, caused an increase in the activity of calpain, a calcium-dependent protease responsible for the cleavage of several actin binding proteins, including spectrin. Treatment with Wnt5a promoted growth cone advance, as well as axonal growth, and these effects were prevented by chelating intracellular calcium, inhibition or down-regulation of calpain, or blockade of spectrin cleavage by competitive peptides. Interestingly, both Wnt5a and activated calpain were found to be mainly distributed in the axon-rich intermediate zone of neocortex. Down-regulating calpain expression interfered with the growth of callosal axons in vivo. Thus, Wnt5a serves as a physiological cue to stimulate localized calpain activity, which in turn promotes growth cone advance and axonal growth.

Wingless-type murine mammary tumor virus integration site (Wnt) family proteins regulate many aspects of neuronal development, including neuronal positioning, axon and dendrite development, and synaptogenesis (1Salinas P.C. Zou Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Canonical Wnts, such as Wnt1, -3a, and -8, by binding to Frizzled (Fz) receptors and co-receptor LRP-5 or -6, cause inhibition of GSK3 and prevent phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin; the rise of β-catenin in the nucleus regulates target gene expression (2Gordon M.D. Nusse R.

For example, Wnt signaling has been reported to orient anterior-posterior axon outgrowth in Caenorhabditis elegans (12Pan C.L. Howell J.E. Clark S.G. Hilliard M. Cordes S. Bargmann C.I. Garriga G.

However, the mechanism of Wnt action in regulating axon development is not clear. Calpain, a family of intracellular cystine proteases, can be activated at various pathological or physiological conditions, including ischemic or traumatic neuronal insults (15Yamashima T.

In cultured Aplysia neurons, localized and transient elevations of intracellular calcium and activation of calpain induce growth cone formation from intact neurons or injury sites after axotomy (24Ziv N.E.

Spira M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1123-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In line with this notion, depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton by pharmacological treatments has been shown to promote axon development in cultured hippocampal neurons (27Schwamborn J.C. Püschel A.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 28Kunda P. Paglini G. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Caceres A. J.

Dotti C.G. Science. 1999; 283: 1931-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that spatial instability of actin structures at the growth cone is important for neuronal polarization and axonal growth (31Witte H. Bradke F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how this actin instability is induced by physiological cues during axon development. Here we demonstrate a role of Wnt5a in regulating calpain activity during axonal growth. We found that treatment of cultured primary neurons with Wnt5a, but not Wnt3a, causes an increase in calpain activity, leading to spectrin cleavage. Importantly, local application of Wnt5a causes localized activation of calpain in developing axons of polarizing neurons. Furthermore, treatment with Wnt5a enhanced forward movement of growth cones, and this effect depended on intracellular calcium and calpain activity. This study demonstrates a novel role of Wnt/Ca2+ signaling in cytoskeleton regulation and axon development. M-calpain was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) in frame with EGFP 3The abbreviations used are EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester; IZ, intermediate zone; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; DIVn, day in vitro n; En, embryonic day n; NMDA, N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid. at the HindIII and KpnI sites. The siRNA targeting sequence was as follows: si-mCalpn, 5′-GAATGGCGATTTCTGCATC-3′; si-Scrambled, 5′-GCTGATGCCGATCTAGTAT-3′. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were subcloned into BglII- and HindIII-digested pSUPER (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) to generate construct for si-mCalpn or si-Scrambled. Rat brains were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors, followed by centrifugation (15,700 relative centrifugal force (rcf) for 1 h at 4 °C). Cultured cortical neurons were lysed in the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Brain homogenates or cell lysates (30–100 μg) were size-fractionated by electrophoresis on 6 or 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Antibodies used were spectrin (MAB1622 (1:1000), Millipore), β-actin (MAB1501 (1:5000), Millipore), GFP (A11122 (1:1000), Invitrogen). Antibody against cleaved spectrin was generated by immunizing rabbit with the peptide with the sequence of CQQQEVY, which was fused with carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and affinity-purified. The secondary antibody used was goat anti-rabbit IgG (AP132P, Millipore) or goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to HRP (AP124P, Millipore). Dissociated hippocampal or cortical neurons were isolated from E18 rats as described previously (32Chen Y.M. Wang Q.J. Hu H.S. Yu P.C. Zhu J. Drewes G. Piwnica-Worms H. Luo Z.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8534-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and transfected by electroporation using the Amaxa Nucleofector device. In some experiments, testing plasmids were co-transfected with EGFP or RFP at a ratio of 3:1. Control or transfected neurons were plated onto coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (0.3 mg/ml). After culturing for 4 h, media were changed to neuronal culture media (neurobasal media containing 1% glutamate and 2% B27). In some instances, neurons at DIV2 or -3 were treated with Wnt5a (100 ng/ml) or Wnt3a (100 ng/ml), without or with pretreatments with DMSO, BAPTA-AM (30 μm, 30 min), calpeptin (40 μm, 1.5 h), or TAT fusion peptides (20 μm TAT-S or TAT-F, 1.5 h). Peptide sequences were as follows: TAT-S, YGRKKRRQRRRGVQAVQQQEVYGMMPRDEADS; TAT-F, YGRKKRRQRRRGTPLRPQQLPSQYTYPQGSQQ. Transfected neurons were subjected to immunoblotting or immunostaining analysis. Neurites positive for Smi-312 and longer than 100 μm were considered as axons. Axonal length was measured using IPP (Image pro plus5.0) software and shown as means ± S.E. from at least three experiments. Values from the control group were normalized as 1.0. Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, washed with PBS three times, and then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After blocking with 10% goat serum in PBS at room temperature for 1 h or 4 °C overnight, neurons were incubated in primary antibodies at 4 °C for 12 h and subsequently with Alexa Fluor 555- or 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Coverslips were mounted and examined using a Nikon Neurolucida system or a Zeiss confocal microscope. Embryonic rat brains were directly removed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after transcardial perfusion. After dehydration, fetal brains were cryopreserved in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura). Coronal cryostat sections were cut at 30-μm thickness on a freezing microtome and immediately processed for immunostaining by a three-step free floating protocol (at 4 °C). Antibodies used were Wnt5a (AF645 (1:100) R&D), Smi-312 (1:1000, Covance), or cleaved spectrin (1:100). In utero electroporation was performed as described previously (33Saito T. Nakatsuji N. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Briefly, uterine horns of pregnant rats at E16 were exposed, and 1–2 μg of plasmid solution was injected into the lateral ventricle of the embryonic brain with a fine glass micropipette. Embryos were then clamped between 5-mm diameter tweezers-type disc electrodes (CUY650-5, Tokiwa Science) and were given five electrical pulses (55 V, 100 ms) at an interval of 1 s (electroporator ECM830, BTX). Uterine horns were then placed back into the abdominal cavity to allow the embryos to continue development. Cortical neurons were co-transfected with testing plasmids and RFP and were plated onto the coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (0.3 mg/ml). At DIV2, cells were imaged under a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with a 40× object lens. Under some conditions, neurons were treated with Wnt5a (100 ng/ml) or Wnt3a (100 ng/ml), without or with pretreatment with various reagents (e.g. 30 μm BAPTA-AM for 30 min, 40 μm calpeptin for 1.5 h, or 20 μm TAT fusion peptides for 1.5 h). Upon application of Wnts, 10-min movies with intervals of 10 s were captured with LSM software to record the growth cone behavior. For each growth cone, the distance between the tip of the longest filopodia and the center of the original growth cone at the indicated time point was measured using IPP software. Average values of 10 neurons at each time point upon Wnt treatments were illustrated to reflect growth cone dynamics. A linker sequence encoding a peptide identical to the calpain cleavage site of αII-spectrin flanked by glycine and serine residues (GSGSGQQEVYGMMPRDGSG) (34Vanderklish P.W. Krushel L.A. Holst B.H. Gally J.A. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was used to adjoin EYFP and ECFP sequences, generating a FRET probe designated as pYSC. Cortical neurons were transfected with pYSC, followed by local application of Wnt5a or Wnt3a (200 ng/μl) with a micropipette that had a tip opening of ∼1 μm, which was 100 μm away from the center of the growth cone. The pressure was applied to the pipette with an electrically gated pressure application system (PM8000-B eight-channel pressure injector, WPI). Immediately after application of Wnts, growth cones were imaged on a Nikon Ti microscope equipped with a mercury lamp using an APO TIRF 100× oil objective (numerical aperture 1.49). Images were acquired using three different fluorescence filter cubes: a CFP filter set (excitation, 420–445 nm; emission, 460–510 nm), a YFP filter set (excitation, 490–500 nm; emission, 520–560 nm), and a FRET filter set (excitation, 420–445 nm; emission, 520–560 nm). Images were recorded simultaneously by the Cascade 512B CCD (Roper Scientific) with the Macro Manager software. The ratio of YFP to CFP, as determined by the ImageJ software and RiFRET plugin, represents the FRET signal, which is inversely correlated with the calpain activity. Wnt5a has been shown to promote neuronal polarization when overexpressed in cultured hippocampal neurons (35Zhang X. Zhu J. Yang G.Y. Wang Q.J. Qian L. Chen Y.M. Chen F. Tao Y. Hu H.S. Wang T. Luo Z.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We determined distribution of Wnt5a in the rat brain. Interestingly, Wnt5a was found to be enriched in the intermediate zone (IZ) of the rat neocortex, which is enriched with traversing callosal axons positive for axonal marker Smi-312 (Fig. 1A), coinciding with the notion that Wnt5a promotes axon development. Given the role of Wnt5a in triggering calcium transients in various cell types, we determined whether Wnt5a activates calpain. Among the numerous calpain substrates, spectrin, the main protein component of the cell membrane skeleton, exhibits high sensitivity to calpain cleavage (36Siman R. Baudry M. Lynch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 3572-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 37Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1264-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Czogalla A. Sikorski A.F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1913-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). αII-spectrin, which is mainly located in the axonal membrane and plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission (39Sikorski A.F. Terlecki G. Zagon I.S. Goodman S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), can be specifically cleaved by calpain, resulting in two proteolytic fragments of similar electrophoretic mobility, ∼136 and ∼148 kDa, respectively (38Czogalla A. Sikorski A.F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1913-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 40Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Thus, the levels of cleaved fragment are usually used to reveal calpain activity. We found that treatment with Wnt5a, but not Wnt3a, caused a progressive increase in the level of cleaved spectrin in cultured cortical neurons (Fig. 1, B and C), and this increase was prevented by pretreatment with BAPTA-AM, a selective chelator of intracellular calcium store, or calpain inhibitor calpeptin (Fig. 1D). Thus, Wnt5a-induced cleavage of spectrin depends on calpain activity. To determine regional distribution of calpain activity in the brain, we generated an antibody that was specific for calpain-mediated spectrin degradation product (Fig. 2A). This antibody specifically recognized cleaved ∼136-kDa fragment but not full-length spectrin (Fig. 2B). Next, we used this antibody to determine regional distribution of calpain activity in the rat brain. Interestingly, cleaved spectrin was found in both the cortical plate and the axon-rich IZ regions (Fig. 2D). These results suggest a correlation between calpain activation and axon development. To monitor calpain activity in cultured neurons, we generated a construct by linking YFP and CFP coding sequences with the calpain cleavage site of αII-spectrin (Fig. 3A), designated as pYSC (where YSC represents YFP-spectrin-CFP), following the method described in a previous report (34Vanderklish P.W. Krushel L.A. Holst B.H. Gally J.A. Crossin K.L. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Under resting conditions without calpain activation, this fusion protein (YSC) was assumed to exhibit FRET. Upon calpain activation, proteolysis of linking region was speculated to cause diminution in FRET signals; thus, the changes of FRET signal could be used to reflect calpain activity (Fig. 3A). First, we determined the responsiveness of the FRET construct to Wnt5a in cultured cortical neurons transfected with pYSC. We found that treatment with Wnt5a, but not Wnt3a, resulted in an increase in the level of monomeric flurophores (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating the proteolysis of YSC fusion proteins and the activation of calpain. In contrast, the calpain-resistant construct with scrambled sequence linking YFP and CFP exhibited no responsiveness to Wnt5a treatment (Fig. 3D). This induced YSC cleavage happened as early as 5 min upon Wnt5a treatment (Fig. 3B) and requires intracellular calcium and calpain because BAPTA-AM or calpeptin treatment prevented accumulation of monomeric flurophores (Fig. 3E, lanes 4 and 5). To further test the specificity of Wnt5a in inducing spectrin cleavage, cortical neurons transfected with pYSC were treated with cell-penetrating peptides composed of the TAT sequence derived from the transactivator of transcription of human immunodeficiency virus and the calpain cleavage site of spectrin or filamin A, hereafter referred to as TAT-S or TAT-F. We found that these peptides also prevented the accumulation of monomeric flurophores induced by Wnt5a (Fig. 3E). Thus, Wnt5a activates calpain, and YSC is a reliable tool to monitor calpain activity in situ. Next, local calpain activity was determined in real-time imaging experiments in cultures of dissociated cortical neurons, whose axonal growth cones were locally administered with Wnt5a or -3a. Images were collected before and after treatment. We found that local application of Wnt5a to the growth cone of a pYSC-expressing neuron caused a decrease in the relative proportions of FRET-based fluorescence to donor fluorescence, whereas application of Wnt3a had no effect on FRET signals (Fig. 4, A and C). The effect of Wnt5a on FRET signals of YSC could be blocked promptly by the addition of Wnt5a antibodies (Fig. 4, A and C). Furthermore, the FRET signals of the calpain-resistant YFP-scrambled-CFP construct was not affected by Wnt5a (Fig. 4, B and D). Thus, Wnt5a, but not Wnt3a, causes activation of calpain in developing axons. Given the role of Wnt5a in evoking the fluctuations of intracellular calcium (7Kühl M. Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 279-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 9Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Busa W.B. Moon R.T. Dev.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5873-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and in stimulating calpain activity shown above, we investigated the role of calpain in axonal growth. We found that Wnt5a treatment caused a marked increase in axon length (Fig. 5, A, B, and E). Interestingly, this Wnt5a-induced axonal growth was prevented by pretreatment with BAPTA-AM or calpeptin (Fig. 5B). This result suggests the involvement of calpain in Wnt5a-induced axonal growth. To exclude potential side effects of synthetic inhibitors, we took the approach of small interference RNA (siRNA) to down-regulate the expression of calpain. Among the various types of calpains, m-calpain plays a specific role in regulating fibroblast membrane protrusion and is required for the proteolysis of the cytoskeletal and focal adhesion proteins FAK, paxillin, spectrin, or talin (42Franco S. Perrin B. Huttenlocher A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies suggested that m- but not μ-calpain might contribute to Ca2+-induced growth cone formation in cultured Aplysia neurons (26Gitler D. Spira M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1123-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, we chose to down-regulate m-calpain. The siRNA construct against m-calpain (si-mCalpn) was effective in down-regulating the expression of co-transfected m-calpain-GFP in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5C) and endogenous m-calpain in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5D), whereas vehicle vector pSUPER or control siRNA construct (si-Scrambled) had no knockdown effect. We found that transfection with si-mCalpn, but not si-Scrambled, prevented the Wnt5a axonal growth-promoting effect (Fig. 5E). Thus, the role of Wnt5a in promoting axonal growth requires appropriate levels of m-calpain. The long term extension of neurites is believed to rely on the transport of vesicles along microtubules, and the short term cellular events that initiate the growth cone formation may be regulated by actin dynamics. Given the relation between calpain activity and growth cone formation (26Gitler D. Spira M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1123-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the activation of calpain by Wnt5a, we investigated the role of Wnt5a in regulating short term growth cone behavior. Cultured cortical neurons were transfected with RFP plasmid, and the behavior of the growth cone was recorded by the usage of time lapse video fluorescence microscopy. We found that treatment with Wnt5a promoted growth cone motility within a short period of time (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting enhanced actin dynamics triggered by Wnt5a. In line with this notion, treatment with Wnt5a markedly enhanced forward movement by the growth cone with the fastest advancing speed (Fig. 6C). However, Wnt3a, which was incapable of activating calpain (Figs. 1C and 3C), had a mild but not significant effect on growth cone advance (Fig. 6C). Thus, Wnt5a has a specific role in regulating growth cone behavior. Next, we determined whether calpain is involved in Wnt5a-regulated growth cone behavior. Cultured cortical neurons at DIV2 were pretreated with 30 μm BAPTA-AM, 40 μm calpeptin, or vehicle DMSO before exposure to Wnt5a (100 ng/ml). We found that the role of Wnt5a in stimulating growth cone forward movement was abolished by pretreatment with BAPTA-AM or calpeptin (Fig. 7, A, C, and E), suggesting the involvement of intracellular calcium and calpain in induced growth cone dynamics. Interestingly, pretreatment with TAT-S or TAT-F peptides, which was shown to prevent Wnt5a-induced cleavage of spectrin (Fig. 3E), also abolished the effect of Wnt5a on growth cone advance (Fig. 7, A, C, and E). This result suggests that calpain-mediated cleavage of actin-binding proteins, such as spectrin, may be involved in growth cone dynamics. Furthermore, down-regulation of m-calpain with si-mCalpn prevented the growth cone-stimulating effect of Wnt5a (Fig. 7, B, D, and F). Taken together, all of these results suggest that Wnt5a-Ca2+ signaling acts to activate calpain, leading to the truncation of actin-binding proteins and enhanced growth cone dynamics, which are essential for axonal growth. Having investigated the role of calpain in axonal growth in vitro, we next determined the role of calpain in vivo. The cerebral cortex is made up of six cellular layers, with neurons at each layer sending an axon ventrally toward the IZ. Once the axons reach the IZ, some of them turn toward the midline and form the corpus callosum, the largest fiber tract in the brain that connects neurons in the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The major projections across the corpus callosum are derived from neurons in layers 2/3 and 5 (43O'Leary D.D. Schlaggar B.L. Tuttle R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 419-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 44O'Leary D.D. Koester S.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 991-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 45O'Leary D.D. Chou S.J. Sahara S. Neuron. 2007; 56: 252-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Given the activation of calpain in IZ regions (Fig. 2C) and the role of calpain in mediating the effect of Wnt5a on axonal growth in cultured primary neurons, we determined the role of calpain in callosal axonal growth in vivo. We took advantage of the in utero electroporation technique to deliver expression constructs into rat cortical neurons (33Saito T. Nakatsuji N. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Vehicle vector pSUPER or that encoding si-mCalpn was co-injected with pCAG-EYFP plasmid into the lateral ventricle of the E16 rat brain, followed by electroporation into a subpopulation of neuronal progenitor cells. At P4, brains were sectioned and stained with Hoechst to mark cortical layers. We found numerous callosal axons in the control group had crossed midline along the corpus callosum (Fig. 8A, top panels). However, down-regulation of m-calpain markedly interfered with callosal axonal growth (Fig. 8A, bottom panels), as reflected by decreased axon length of si-mCalpn-transfected neurons in comparison with control axons (Fig. 8B). Thus, m-calpain is required for axonal growth in vivo. As an important second messenger in the cell, calcium has been shown to play important roles in controlling growth cone behavior (46Zheng J.Q. Poo M.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 375-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 47Kater S.B. Mattson M.P. Cohan C. Connor J. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 315-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Calpain, as a calcium sensor, regulates actin remodeling during cell spreading (48Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J.

https://openalex.org/W2008559540,"Epidermal differentiation in the ventral ectoderm of Xenopus embryos is regulated by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. However, it remains unclear how the BMP pathway is activated and induces the epidermal fate in the ventral ectoderm. Here, we identify a novel player in the BMP pathway that is required for epidermal differentiation during Xenopus early embryonic development. We show that Xenopus EIG121L (xEIG121L) protein, an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein, is expressed in the ventral ectoderm at the gastrula and neurula stages. Almost complete knockdown of xEIG121L protein with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides in early Xenopus embryos results in severe developmental defects, including the inhibition of epidermal differentiation and the induction of neural genes. Remarkably, our analysis shows that BMP/Smad1 signaling is severely suppressed in the xEIG121L knockdown ectoderm. Moreover, immunoprecipitation and immunostaining experiments suggest that xEIG121L protein physically interacts, and co-localizes, with BMP receptors. Thus, our results identify a novel regulator of the BMP pathway that has a positive role in BMP signaling and plays an essential role in epidermal differentiation during early embryonic development."
