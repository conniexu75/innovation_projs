https://openalex.org/W2088395296,"There are currently many plans for sustainable use or sustainable development that are founded upon scientific information and consensus. Such ideas reflect ignorance of the history of resource exploitation and misunderstanding of the possibility of achieving scientific consensus concerning resources and the environment. Although there is considerable variation in detail, there is remarkable consistency in the history of resource exploitation: resources are inevitably overexploited, often to the point of collapse or extinction. We suggest that such consistency is due to the following common features: (i) Wealth or the prospect of wealth generates political and social power that is used to promote unlimited exploitation of resources. (ii) Scientific understanding and consensus is hampered by the lack of controls and replicates, so that each new problem involves learning about a new system. (iii) The complexity of the underlying biological and physical systems precludes a reductionist approach to management. Optimum levels of exploitation must be determined by trial and error. (iv) Large levels of natural variability mask the effects of overexploitation. Initial overexploitation is not detectable until it is severe and often irreversible."
https://openalex.org/W2095534151,"Ultrasonic irradiation of liquids causes acoustic cavitation: the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles. Bubble collapse during cavitation generates transient hot spots responsible for high-energy chemistry and emission of light. Determination of the temperatures reached in a cavitating bubble has remained a difficult experimental problem. As a spectroscopic probe of the cavitation event, sonoluminescence provides a solution. Sonoluminescence spectra from silicone oil were reported and analyzed. The observed emission came from excited state C(2) (Swan band transitions, d(3)IIg-a(3)II(micro)), which has been modeled with synthetic spectra as a function of rotational and vibrational temperatures. From comparison of synthetic to observed spectra, the effective cavitation temperature was found to be 5075 +/- 156 K."
https://openalex.org/W2104312889,"When a liquid is confined in a narrow gap (as near a cell membrane, in a lubricated contact between solids, or in a porous medium), new dynamic behavior emerges. The effective shear viscosity is enhanced compared to the bulk, relaxation times are prolonged, and nonlinear responses set in at lower shear rates. These effects are more prominent, the thinner the liquid film. They appear to be the manifestation of collective motions. The flow of liquids under extreme confinement cannot be understood simply by intuitive extrapolation of bulk properties. Practical consequences are possible in areas from tribology and materials processing to membrane physics."
https://openalex.org/W2084348779,"The possibility induction of light emission from silicon, an indirect bandgap material in which radiative transitions are unlikely, raises several interesting and technologically important possibilities, especially the fabrication of a truly integrated optoelectronic microchip. In this article, the natural considerations that constrain silicon from emitting light efficiently are examined, as are several engineered solutions to this limitation. These include intrinsic and alloy-induced luminescence; radiatively active impurities; quantum-confined structures, including zone folding and the recent developments in porous silicon; and a hybrid approach, the integration of direct bandgap materials onto silicon."
https://openalex.org/W1967263680,"In eastern Africa the altitude of the boundary between montane forest and lowland savanna grassland changed substantially in response to climate change during the later Holocene, but this is not clearly reflected in regional pollen records. The carbon-13 to carbon-12 ratios of tropical grasses are higher than those of most other plants, and this difference is preserved in soil organic carbon stable isotope ratios. Soil organic matter (13)C/(12)C ratios in profiles along an altitude transect in the central Rift Valley of Kenya suggest that the forest-savanna boundary advanced more than 300 meters in altitude. This could have implications for understanding the effects of climate change on the configuration of floral zones, prehistoric hunter-gatherer land-use patterns, and the timing of the advent of Neolithic food production."
https://openalex.org/W2056253342,"In an extending terrane basaltic magma supplied at a pressure greater than the least principal stress (overpressure) may be capable of suppressing normal faulting and the earthquakes and topographic relief that commonly accompany normal faulting. As vertical dikes intrude, they press against their walls in the direction opposite the least principal stress and increase its magnitude. The emplacement of tabular intrusions causes the internal magma pressure to act selectively in opposition to tectonic stresses. This process tends to equalize the stresses and thus diminishes the deviatoric stress (difference between maximum and minimum stresses) that creates faults and causes earthquakes. Observations of the pattern of seismicity and magmatism worldwide indicate that magmatism commonly supplants large earthquakes as the primary mechanism for accommodating tectonic extension. Recognizing the extent of magmatic stress accommodation is important in assessing seismic and volcanic risks."
https://openalex.org/W2045398591,"Neutral sodium emissions encircling Jupiter exhibit an intricate and variable structure that is well matched by a simple loss process from Io's atmosphere. These observations imply that fast neutral sodium is created locally in the Io plasma torus, both near Io and as much as 8 hours downstream. Sodium-bearing molecules may be present in Io's upper atmosphere, where they are ionized by the plasma torus and swept downstream. The molecular ions dissociate and dissociatively recombine on a short time scale, releasing neutral fragments into escape trajectories from Jupiter. This theory explains a diverse set of sodium observations, and it implies that molecular reactions (particularly electron impact ionization and dissociation) are important at the top of Io's atmosphere."

https://openalex.org/W1975127050,"Heavy fermion materials - so named because their conduction electrons behave as though they had extra mass - are like the cuprates in that they exhibit unusual superconducting properties. By the time the cuprates had been discovered, a good understanding of these materials was in hand. Unlike theories of high-[Tc] superconductivity, however, ideas about heavy fermions have not been the subject of great controversy. Thus, most of the effort in this backwater of condensed matter physics has focused on certain details of the behavior of one particularly well-studied compounds, UPt[sub 3]. The cause for sustained interest was that the process of developing ever more elaborate explanations for ever more elaborate experiments did not seem to converage. A recent paper by Midgley et al. reporting modulations in the crystal lattice of UPt[sub 3] suggests that theory and experiment might finally converge in a way that, while it does not threaten the broad understanding of heavy fermion systems, involves a degree of freedom ignored until now even in the face of past experience with elemental metallic uranium. Their transmission electron micrograph evidence for the existence of an incommensurate lattice modulation in UPt[sub 3] implicates this modulation as a probable source of themore » double superconducting transitions. Remarkably, the superconducting and magnetic coherence lengths, and the now discovered modulation period, are all of the same magnitude. For some time people have felt that stacking faults might be relevant to the properties of UPt[sub 3], but these new results are distinct from this. What Midgley et al. suggest is that the complicated superconducting phase diagram of UPt[sub 3] derives from the internal strain field caused by the modulation, and that this strain field lifts the degeneracy associated with unconventional pairing.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2061713175,"The real ocean is so complex that researchers have had to limit their modeling to just one part of it, or content themselves with a scale so coarse that key features of the ocean's circulation were lost. Now, by exploiting a parallel supercomputer, two modelers have managed to squeeze the entire world ocean into a box while preserving some crucial details such as the 50- to 100-kilometer-wide eddies that pinwheel around the ocean and the currents that snake through the narrow straits between ocean basins. As a benchmark of realism, oceanographers have singled our eddies. These small storms play an important role in ferrying heat and salt around the ocean. And eddies only emerge when a model simulates the ocean in blocks measuring roughly half a degree on a side or smaller. Semtner and Chervin's global model, as published last year, had only half-degree blocks, but they recently refined it to a quarter-degree on average and made other improvements. The near-completeness of Semtner and Chervin's model - only the Arctic Ocean is walled out - is revealing things that simply can't show up in regional models. The centerpiece of Semtner and Chervin's early analyses is the looping conveyor belt flow.more » As oceanographers had pictured the flow, it carries warm, fresh surface waters from the Pacific through the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic, and up the Gulf Stream to the neighborhood of Iceland. By then evaporation has made the surface water saltier and thus denser; when the water gives up its heat to the cold north winds - in the process keeping Europe a good 6[degree]C warmer than it would otherwise be - it becomes dense enough to sink into the abyss. The result is a return flow through the deep sea: a broad, slow flood carrying 100 times as much water as the Amazon that flows out of the Atlantic and back to the Pacific by way of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2092174742,"The big three weapons laboratories - Los Alamos, Livermore, and Sandia - could face dramatic changes in the way they do business if a proposal made by Representative George Brown (D-CA) is enacted. Brown, chairman of the House Science Committee, introduced a bill last week that would consolidate nuclear weapons R D from several labs (without saying at which sites or how). Brown also wants to shift the focus of the labs work more toward civilian projects, and the bill would involve the White House more directly in managing their research agenda. The Brown bill (HR 1432), which has won the backing of Representatives Marilyn Lloyd (D-TN), Tim Valentine (D-NC), Rick Boucher (D-VA), and Ron Wyden (R-OR), asks the secretary of energy to make a comprehensive study of current lab activities and submit a plan to redirect one or more of these labs to civilian missions by 31 March 1994. Brown and other members of Congress had considered turning one of the nuclear weapons centers into a green lab, that is, dedicating it to R D on environmental technology. That idea seems to have been set aside in favor of a more general formula that would be administered by amore » new Federal Laboratory Mission Evaluation and Coordination Committee, reporting to the president's science adviser. This watchdog panel, according to the bill, would seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of all the federal laboratories and ensure that between 10% and 20% of their budgets are devoted to collaborative efforts with industry and state and local governments. Administratively, the bill would also create some new positions at the Dept. of Energy (DOE), including an undersecretary for science and technology who would manage the labs.« less"
