To date, mechanisms referring to tumor exosome trafficking, including release and cell-cell transmission, have not been described. To gain insight into this, exosomes purified from metastatic melanoma cell medium were labeled with a lipid fluorescent probe, R18, and analyzed by spectrofluorometry and confocal microscopy. A low pH condition is a hallmark of tumor malignancy, potentially influencing exosome release and uptake by cancer cells. Using different pH conditions as a modifier of exosome traffic, we showed (i) an increased exosome release and uptake at low pH when compared with a buffered condition and (ii) exosome uptake by melanoma cells occurred by fusion. Membrane biophysical analysis, such as fluidity and lipid composition, indicated a high rigidity and sphingomyelin/ganglioside GM3 (N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide) content in exosomes released at low pH. This was likely responsible for the increased fusion efficiency. Consistent with these results, pretreatment with proton pump inhibitors led to an inhibition of exosome uptake by melanoma cells. Fusion efficiency of tumor exosomes resulted in being higher in cells of metastatic origin than in those derived from primary tumors or normal cells. Furthermore, we found that caveolin-1, a protein involved in melanoma progression, is highly delivered through exosomes released in an acidic condition. The results of our study provide the evidence that exosomes may be used as a delivery system for paracrine diffusion of tumor malignancy, in turn supporting the importance of both exosomes and tumor pH as key targets for future anti-cancer strategies.

Cells of different histotypes release intact organelles known as microvesicles or exosomes (1.Andreola G. Rivoltini L. Castelli C. Huber V. Perego P. Deho P. Squarcina P. Accornero P. Lozupone F.

Exosomes have been studied for their molecular composition and biological functions and indicate a specific protein profile (1.Andreola G. Rivoltini L. Castelli C. Huber V. Perego P. Deho P.

Proteomics. 2004; 4: 4019-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Much less is known on the regulatory role of these microvesicles. Several hypotheses suggest that exosomes may represent a vehicle for intercellular communication. In fact, exosomes may deliver proteins, soluble factors, and most importantly, RNA and microRNAs which modulate the protein expression of recipient cells (7.Valadi H. Ekström K. Bossios A. Sjöstrand M. Lee J.J. Lötvall J.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (8980) Google Scholar). This appears of great importance for both the normal homeostasis of the body and the pathogenesis of various diseases, including tumors. As an example, human cancer cells produce large amounts of microvesicles bearing proapoptotic molecules (1.Andreola G. Rivoltini L. Castelli C. Huber V. Perego P. Deho P. Squarcina P. Accornero P.

These in turn are able to induce apoptosis of activated tumor-specific T cells, thus impairing the ability of effector lymphocytes to exert their cytolytic activity against tumor targets. As a consequence, exosomes may create an immuno-privileged environment within the tumors, similar to some physiologic conditions needing immunotolerance (9.Kim J.W. Wieckowski E. Taylor D.D. Reichert T.E. Watkins S. Whiteside T.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1010-1020PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, exosomes released by normal and tumor cells seem to differ in both functional and structural properties (10.Taylor D.D. Lyons K.S. Gerçel-Taylor C. Gynecol. Oncol. 2002; 84: 443-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that exosomes are actively released within tumor tissues or directly spilled into the blood stream but apparently without any specific commitment to tissue targeting (2.Huber V. Fais S. Iero M. Lugini L. Canese P. Squarcina P. Zaccheddu A. Colone M. Arancia G. Gentile M. Seregni E. Valenti R. Ballabio G. Belli F. Leo E. Parmiani G. Rivoltini L.

However, there are some unsolved mysteries regarding the mechanism(s) regulating exosome traffic between the outside and the inside of cells, including internalization of exosomes in target cells. It has been proposed that the interaction of exosomes and recipient cells may occur through receptor-ligand binding (11.Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Liejendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar). Alternatively, exosomes enter into normal dendritic cells by an endocytic pathway or they may fuse with platelets (12.Del Conde I. Shrimpton C.N. Thiagarajan P. López J.A. Blood. 2005; 106: 1604-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 13.Morelli A.E. Larregina A.T. Shufesky W.J. Sullivan M.L. Stolz D.B. Papworth G.D. Zahorchak A.F. Logar A.J. Wang Z. Watkins S.C. Falo Jr., L.D. Thomson A.W. Blood. 2004; 104: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Studies looking at the nature of the interaction of tumor exosomes with cells are inexistent. To address the hypothesis that exosome internalization takes place in tumor cells through membrane fusion mechanism, we set up a fusion assay based on R18 lipid probe dequenching, previously used in viral fusion tests (14.Chu V.C. McElroy L.J. Chu V. Bauman B.E. Whittaker G.R. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 3180-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Some features of tumor microenvironment may represent key factors in the regulation of exosome traffic within the tumor mass. In particular, the tumor microenvironment is acidic, and we have demonstrated that acidity is involved in the regulation of some vesicle-mediated malignant tumor cell functions, such as cannibalism and drug resistance (15.De Milito A. Iessi E. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Spada M. Marino M.L. Federici C. Perdicchio M. Matarrese P. Lugini L. Nilsson A. Fais S.

Malignant melanoma cells survive in an acidic microenvironment, a condition that does not allow survival of normal cells (17.Lugini L. Matarrese P. Tinari A. Lozupone F. Federici C. Iessi E. Gentile M. Luciani F. Parmiani G. Rivoltini L. Malorni W. Fais S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3629-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This survival option of malignant tumor cells is conceivably due to hyperfunctional proton pumps that do not allow acidification of cytosol. In fact, a specific inhibition of H+ release (through proton pump inhibitors (PPI) 2The abbreviations used are: PPIproton pump inhibitorcav-1caveolin-1PBMCperipheral blood mononuclear cell(s)PAFparaformaldehydeTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidGPgeneralized polarizationSMsphingomyelinGM3N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramideMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered saline. ) can induce both acidification of the tumor cell cytosol (15.De Milito A. Iessi E. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Spada M. Marino M.L. Federici C. Perdicchio M. Matarrese P. Lugini L. Nilsson A. Fais S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5408-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and acidic vesicle retention within tumor cells (16.Luciani F. Spada M. De Milito A. Molinari A. Rivoltini L. Montinaro A. Marra M. Lugini L. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Federici C. Iessi E. Parmiani G. Arancia G. Belardelli F. Fais S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings we tested whether microenvironmental acidity might be involved in the traffic of tumor exosomes in regulating both their release and uptake by tumor cells. Accordingly, we set up a suitable in vitro model to study the role of low pH in favoring exosome uptake in human metastatic and primary melanoma cell culture. These melanoma cells, which are capable of bearing a low pH condition (17.Lugini L. Matarrese P. Tinari A. Lozupone F. Federici C. Iessi E. Gentile M. Luciani F. Parmiani G. Rivoltini L. Malorni W. Fais S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3629-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), allowed us to show that melanoma cell acidity was involved in both the exosome release and the uptake by fusion with cell membranes. This was consistent with a different lipid composition of exosomes released at different pH values and with a clear inhibition of exosome uptake after pretreatment with PPI (16.Luciani F. Spada M. De Milito A. Molinari A. Rivoltini L. Montinaro A. Marra M. Lugini L. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Federici C. Iessi E. Parmiani G. Arancia G. Belardelli F. Fais S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Finally, to investigate the possible physiologic role of acidity in exosome uptake, we used a caveolin-1 (cav-1)-bearing exosome model, previously reported to play a role in melanoma progression (18.Felicetti F. Parolini I. Bottero L. Fecchi K. Errico M.C. Raggi C. Biffoni M. Spadaro F. Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Carè A. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; 125: 1514-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By using this model, we were able to demonstrate that in an acidic condition cav-1 associated to melanoma exosome is delivered more efficiently to less aggressive tumor cells. In conclusion, in our study we provide evidence that low pH, which is a hallmark of malignant tumors, plays a key role in aberrantly regulating exosome traffic within the tumor mass. proton pump inhibitor caveolin-1 peripheral blood mononuclear cell(s) paraformaldehyde N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid generalized polarization sphingomyelin N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline. Melanoma cell lines were supplied by Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy, and were obtained from metastatic lesions (Mel1-Mel3, Me665/1) and from primary lesions (MelP1-MelP3, WM983A). PBMC were purified from buffy coat by Ficoll-Hypaque following manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Melanoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum previously deprived of bovine microvesicles by ultracentrifugation (60 min at 100,000 × g) and antibiotics in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Experiments were performed with cells in exponential growth in acidic (pH 6.0) (Mel1ac) or buffered (pH 7.4) (Mel1) media. Microvesicles were isolated from supernatant of Mel1 (exoMel1) or Mel1ac (exoMel1ac) cells by sequential centrifugations as previously described (1.Andreola G. Rivoltini L. Castelli C. Huber V. Perego P. Deho P. Squarcina P. Accornero P. Lozupone F. Lugini L. Stringaro A. Molinari A. Arancia G. Gentile M. Parmiani G. Fais S. J. Exp.

Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar) and then purified on a sucrose gradient (11.Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Liejendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar). The density of each fraction was determined by refractometry. Gradient fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies directed to: Lamp-2 (monoclonal, BD Pharmingen), Rab 5B (polyclonal, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), CD81 (monoclonal, Ancell, Bayport, MN). Fractions positive for Lamp-2, CD81, and Rab 5B were pooled, pelleted, and used in all experiments. For biotin-NHS labeling, exoMel1 was first incubated with water-soluble Sulfo-Biotin-NHS (Calbiochem) (0.5 mg/ml; 30 min at 4 °C), then washed at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove unbound biotin and purified on sucrose gradient. Equal volumes of each fraction were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing and denaturing conditions. The blots were analyzed by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the experiments with PPI, the cells were incubated overnight with 10 μg/ml PPI (AstraZeneca R&D, Mölndal, Sweden), and then biotinylated exosomes (15 μg) were incubated with unlabeled Mel1 cells (1 × 106) for 1 h. Cells were washed and lysed with buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin. In other experiments the blots were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with primary antibodies anti-nucleolin (Clone C23, Santa Cruz) and anti-cav-1 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz). After washing, the filters were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature, and reactivity was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Exosome fusion activity was followed by the increase in fluorescence resulting from dilution of the self-quenched probe R18 (19.Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Exosomes (20 μg of protein/ml) and large unilamellar vesicles (10 μg protein/ml) were labeled, respectively, with 1 and 0.5 μl of an ethanolic solution of the fluorescent lipophilic probe octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (1 mm) for 30 min at room temperature in 1 ml of MES buffer (10 mm MES (pH 6.0 or pH 7.4), 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl). The unincorporated R18 was removed by using a Sephadex G-75 column (20 × 1 cm) equilibrated with saline buffer. Ten μg of labeled exosomes were added to MES fusion buffer in a thermostatted spectrofluorometer FluoroMax-2 (Spex), and fluorescence was measured continuously at 560-nm excitation and 590-nm emission wavelengths (slits 1.5 nm). After an equilibration time of 10 min, unlabeled cells (1 × 106) were added to the exosomes, and fluorescence was monitored for a further 30 min. The fusion reaction was stopped by the addition of Triton X-100 plus octylglucoside at a final concentration of 0.3% and 60 mm respectively, which resulted in maximal probe dilution. The fluorescence increase was measured as the difference with respect to initial fluorescence of labeled exosomes and expressed as % of maximal fluorescence dequenching (FD) according to the equation, % FD = ((F − Fi)/(Fmax − Fi)) × 100, where F is the fluorescence intensity after 30 min of incubation exosomes/cells, Fi is the initial fluorescence value of labeled exosomes, and Fmax is the fluorescence intensity after detergent membrane disruption. R18-labeled exosomes were fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde (PAF) for 20 min at room temperature, then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and used for fusion experiment. In other experiments exosomes were solubilized with 60 mm octylglucoside (Invitrogen) then dialyzed against MES buffer (pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °C. After dialysis, exosomes were recovered and labeled with R18 probe. Fusion activity was tested for 30 min at 37 °C on 1 × 106 Mel1 cells. For cell treatment, 1 × 106 Mel1 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml filipin (Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C, then washed and subjected to fusion. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by filter exclusion using an extrusion apparatus. Briefly, appropriate amounts of lipids dissolved in chloroform were mixed, and the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting lipid films were kept overnight under vacuum. The dry lipids were dispersed by vortex-mixing in 2 mm l-histidine, 2 mm TES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). The suspensions were submitted to 10 cycles of freezing and thawing, then passed 21 times through two stacked 0.1-μm-diameter pore polycarbonate membranes in a Liposofast-Miniextruder (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). All vesicles were supplemented with trace amounts of radiolabeled lipids, and their concentration was determined by radioactivity measurements. To analyze the intracellular fate of exosomes after their entry into tumor cells, the cells were plated on coverslips in WillCo dishes (WillCo Wells, BV, Amsterdam, NH) and fixed with methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. After 2 washes in PBS, cells were probed for 30 min with the following antibodies: Rab 5B (Santa Cruz) for early endosomes, Lamp-1 (clone H4A3, BD Pharmingen) for lysosomes, Golgina (clone CDF4, Molecular Probes) for Golgi apparatus. Then cells were incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Exosomes were labeled with exosome proteins/NHS-rhodamine (10 μg/μl NHS-rhodamine, Pierce) 1:3 (w/w) for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS followed by quenching with serum-free RPMI and washing by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. In lipid colocalization experiments of exoMel1 with parental cells or PBMC, exoMel1 were stained with R18 as previously described, and the cells were labeled with PKH67 dye (green fluorescent cell linker kit, Sigma). Briefly, the cells were incubated in diluent C containing PKH67 for 5 min followed by quenching with fetal bovine serum and then washed with PBS. PKH67-labeled PBMC were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Samples were observed in vivo without fixation with a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Observations were performed with an objective HCX PL APO CS 63 × 1.40 oil in sequential double fluorescence mode (between lines). The excitation wavelengths used were 488 and 543 nm for fluorescein (PKH67) and rhodamine (R18), respectively. Fluorescence emissions were collected after passage through excitation beam splitter FW DD 488/543 filter in a spectral range of 510–555 or 650–700 nm for fluorescein and rhodamine, respectively. The images represent optical sections of double-stained samples. Melanoma cells, cultured in buffered and acidic conditions, were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in 1% OsO4, and then dehydrated in alcohol and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and finally examined with a Philips 208 transmission electron microscope (FEI Co.). To analyze membrane fluidity, the exosomes released from cells cultured at acidic or buffered pH values and parental cells were loaded with the fluorescent probe Laurdan (20.Parasassi T. Krasnowska E.K. Bagatolli L. Gratton E. J. Fluoresc. 1998; 8: 365-373Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar) as previously described (21.Palleschi S. Silvestroni L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, Laurdan from a DMSO stock solution (Laurdan and DMSO final concentrations of 0.11 μm and 0.06%, respectively) was added to Mel1 cells (1 × 106) or exoMel1 (50 μg) resuspended in 2.5 ml of MES buffer, and the probe loading was allowed to proceed in the dark at 37 °C for 45 min. At the end of the loading procedure, a thermal step gradient (40 to 5.5 °C, 0.5 °C min−1) was applied, and fluorescence excitation spectra (320 to 420 nm at both 435- and 490-nm emission wavelengths) were obtained at the selected temperatures. Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a computer-driven L-type spectrofluorometer (FluoroMax-2) equipped with a stirring accessory and thermostatted (±0.1 °C) by a circulating water bath. The monochromator band pass was set at 5 nm for both the excitation and emission path. Spectroscopic data were elaborated in terms of generalized polarization (GP) according to the equation GP = (I435 − I490)/(I435 + I490), where I435 and I490 are the intensity at each excitation wavelength using emission wavelengths of 435 and 490 nm, respectively. GP values were calculated after subtraction of cell or exosome background signal. The signal of unpartitioned probe was always <4% and did not need to be subtracted. The GP value is an index of the rate and extent of membrane water dipolar relaxation processes, which have been found to reliably mirror the lipid packing order irrespective of phospholipid polar head composition and charge in a wide pH range (22.Harris F.M. Best K.B. Bell J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The slope of the GP excitation spectrum can be exploited to ascertain the coexistence of lipid phases. A negative or positive slope indicates a single liquid-crystalline phase or coexisting gel and liquid-crystalline phase domains, respectively (20.Parasassi T. Krasnowska E.K. Bagatolli L. Gratton E. J. Fluoresc. 1998; 8: 365-373Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar). To determine free cholesterol amounts, exosomes and cells were lysed with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, 1.5% CHAPS (w/w), and a proteases inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cholesterol was determined using the cholesterol oxidase-based Amplex Red Cholesterol assay kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Lipid extracts (normalized on 100 μg of protein/sample) were resolved on silica gel plates (Merck), and lipid analysis was performed using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v) (24.Wubbolts R.

The areas containing individual lipids were identified by comigration of standards and were visualized by staining with 3% copper acetate solution in 8% phosphoric acid and subsequent heating at 180 °C for 10 min. The relative amount of lipids was obtained through densitometry analysis by using the Quantity One Bio-Rad software program. Purified exoMel1 and exoMel1ac (10 μg) were stained with R18 as described above and added at different times to melanoma cells (3 × 104 cells/ml) at the corresponding pH values. After PBS washes the cells were sorted on a FACScan machine (BD Biosciences), and at least 1 × 104 events were collected and analyzed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). To evaluate the uptake of exoMe665/1 and exoMe665/1ac into cell membrane compartments, membranes from WM983A cells (1 × 106) treated or not with exoMe665/1 and exoMe665/1ac (65 μg for 2 h at 37 °C followed by PBS washes) were compared. To purify membrane proteins from WM983A, cells were lysed in 0.1 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min at 4 °C and then pelleted down at 1000 × g to remove nuclei. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 60 min. The whole amount of membranes recovered from untreated or exosome-treated WM983A cells was analyzed by Western blotting for cav-1 and Lamp-2 expression.

https://openalex.org/W2066200217,"Blue native gel electrophoresis purification and immunoprecipitation of F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase from bovine heart mitochondria revealed that cyclophilin (CyP) D associates to the complex. Treatment of intact mitochondria with the membrane-permeable bifunctional reagent dimethyl 3,3-dithiobis-propionimidate (DTBP) cross-linked CyPD with the lateral stalk of ATP synthase, whereas no interactions with F(1) sector subunits, the ATP synthase natural inhibitor protein IF1, and the ATP/ADP carrier were observed. The ATP synthase-CyPD interactions have functional consequences on enzyme catalysis and are modulated by phosphate (increased CyPD binding and decreased enzyme activity) and cyclosporin (Cs) A (decreased CyPD binding and increased enzyme activity). Treatment of MgATP submitochondrial particles or intact mitochondria with CsA displaced CyPD from membranes and activated both hydrolysis and synthesis of ATP sustained by the enzyme. No effect of CsA was detected in CyPD-null mitochondria, which displayed a higher specific activity of the ATP synthase than wild-type mitochondria. Modulation by CyPD binding appears to be independent of IF1, whose association to ATP synthase was not affected by CsA treatment. These findings demonstrate that CyPD association to the lateral stalk of ATP synthase modulates the activity of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W2021032365,"(Dihydro)ceramide synthase 2 (cers2, formerly called lass2) is the most abundantly expressed member of the ceramide synthase gene family, which includes six isoforms in mice. CERS2 activity has been reported to be specific toward very long fatty acid residues (C22-C24). In order to study the biological role of CERS2, we have inactivated its coding region in transgenic mice using gene-trapped embryonic stem cells that express lacZ reporter DNA under control of the cers2 promoter. The resulting mice lack ceramide synthase activity toward C24:1 in the brain as well as the liver and show only very low activity toward C18:0-C22:0 in liver and reduced activity toward C22:0 residues in the brain. In addition, these mice exhibit strongly reduced levels of ceramide species with very long fatty acid residues (>or=C22) in the liver, kidney, and brain. From early adulthood on, myelin stainability is progressively lost, biochemically accompanied by about 50% loss of compacted myelin and 80% loss of myelin basic protein. Starting around 9 months, both the medullary tree and the internal granular layer of the cerebellum show significant signs of degeneration associated with the formation of microcysts. Predominantly in the peripheral nervous system, we observed vesiculation and multifocal detachment of the inner myelin lamellae in about 20% of the axons. Beyond 7 months, the CERS2-deficient mice developed hepatocarcinomas with local destruction of tissue architecture and discrete gaps in renal parenchyma. Our results indicate that CERS2 activity supports different biological functions: maintenance of myelin, stabilization of the cerebellar as well as renal histological architecture, and protection against hepatocarcinomas."

Runx2 is subject to a number of post-transcriptional controls including selective proteolysis and phosphorylation. We previously reported that Runx2 is phosphorylated and activated by the ERK/MAPK pathway (Xiao, G., Jiang, D., Thomas, P., Benson, M. D., Guan, K., Karsenty, G., and Franceschi, R. T. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 4453–4459). In this study, we used a combination of in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation analysis, mass spectroscopy, and functional assays to identify two sites at Ser301 and Ser319 within the proline/serine/threonine domain of Runx2 that are required for this regulation. These sites are phosphorylated by activated ERK1 in vitro and in cell culture. In addition to confirming ERK-dependent phosphorylation at Ser319, mass spectroscopy identified two other ERK-phosphorylated sites at Ser43 and Ser510. Furthermore, introduction of S301A,S319A mutations rendered Runx2 resistant to MAPK-dependent activation and reduced its ability to stimulate osteoblast-specific gene expression and differentiation after transfection into Runx2-null calvarial cells and mesenchymal cells. In contrast, S301E,S319E Runx2 mutants had enhanced transcriptional activity that was minimally dependent on MAPK signaling, consistent with the addition of a negative charge mimicking serine phosphorylation. These results emphasize the important role played by Runx2 phosphorylation in the control of osteoblast gene expression and provide a mechanism to explain how physiological signals acting on bone through the ERK/MAPK pathway can stimulate osteoblast-specific gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2086763879,"Many RNA nucleases and helicases participate in ribosome biogenesis, but how they cooperate with each other is largely unknown. Here we report that in vivo cleavage of the yeast pre-rRNA at site D, the 3'-end of the 18 S rRNA, requires functional interactions between PIN (PilT N terminus) domain protein Nob1 and the DEAH box RNA helicase Prp43. Nob1 showed specific cleavage on a D-site substrate analogue in vitro, which was abolished by mutations in the Nob1 PIN domain or the RNA substrate. Genetic analyses linked Nob1 to the late pre-40 S-associated factor Ltv1, the RNA helicase Prp43, and its cofactor Pfa1. In strains lacking Ltv1, mutation of Prp43 or Pfa1 led to a striking accumulation of 20 S pre-rRNA in the cytoplasm due to inhibition of site D cleavage. This phenotype was suppressed by increased dosage of wild-type Nob1 but not by Nob1 variants mutated in the catalytic site. In ltv1/pfa1 mutants the 20 S pre-rRNA was susceptible to 3' to 5' degradation by the cytoplasmic exosome. This degraded into the 3' region of the 18 S rRNA, strongly indicating that the preribosomes are structurally defective."

The amino acid sequence of AO and XOR are remarkably similar, with ∼86% homology, and there is structural similarity of AO, XOR, and bacterial molybdenum nitrite reductase. Our recent studies have shown that AO can also function as a nitrite reductase catalyzing nitrite reduction to NO (21.Li H. Cui H. Kundu T.K. Alzawahra W. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17855-17863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, questions remain concerning the mechanism, substrate specificity, magnitude, and quantitative importance of AO-mediated NO generation in biological systems. Although AO and XOR have similar structure and amino acid sequences, their substrate specificity and inhibitor susceptibility are different (28.Beedham C. Prog. Med. Chem. 1987; 24: 85-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Both XOR and AO exhibit broad specificity, accepting a variety of reducing substrates, including purine, pteridine, aldehyde, and NADH (32.Krenitsky T.A. Neil S.M. Elion G.B. Hitchings G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). But AO catalyzes the oxidation of aldehydes and NADH more efficiently, with lower Km, whereas XOR has higher affinity for xanthine, hypoxanthine, pteridine, and purine (14.Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X.

Aldehydes and NADH are different site-specific electron donors for AO. Although aldehydes donate electrons to AO at the molybdenum site, NADH reduces AO at the FAD site (28.Beedham C. Prog. Med. Chem. 1987; 24: 85-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because aldehydes and NADH are widely present in tissues, it is of critical importance to investigate the magnitude and kinetics of nitrite-dependent NO generation in the presence of these endogenous reducing substrates. This will enable characterization of the mechanism and pathophysiological importance of AO-mediated nitrite reduction. To characterize AO-catalyzed NO production and its quantitative importance in biological systems, EPR spectroscopy, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, and immunoassays of cGMP formation were performed. NO formation was shown to occur due to nitrite reduction at the molybdenum site, with either NADH or aldehydes serving as reducing substrates. The kinetic parameters for AO-mediated nitrite reduction were determined, enabling prediction of the magnitude of NO formation and delineation of the quantitative importance of this process in biological systems. 4-(Dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde (DMAC), NADH, sodium nitrite, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), and raloxifene hydrochloride were obtained from Sigma. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) was obtained from Alexis Biochemical Corp. (San Diego). Direct cGMP assay kit was obtained from Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI), and cGMP production was quantified by immunoassay according to the protocol provided by the company. N-Methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD) was synthesized using carbon disulfide and N-methyl-d-glucamine (11.Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol.

[15N]Nitrite was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS) were obtained from Invitrogen. Millipore ultra-free centrifugal filter (nominal molecular weight limit 10,000) was obtained from Fisher. Rat liver AO was purified as we recently reported (35.Kundu T.K. Hille R. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 460: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). AO activity was determined by adding a suitable volume of enzyme solution to 1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 25 μm DMAC as reducing substrate at 30 °C and monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 398 nm. DMAC oxidations and absorbance changes were converted to units of enzyme activity (IU) using an extinction coefficient ϵ = 30.5 mm−1 cm−1. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 μmol of DMAC/min at 30 °C (35.Kundu T.K. Hille R. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 460: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The activity of freshly isolated AO was ∼1.8 units/mg but declined over time. The purified AO was stored under liquid nitrogen until needed. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were heparinized with 500 units of heparin and anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital at a dose of 30–35 mg/kg. The livers were excised and washed with HBSS (4 °C) to remove any residual blood and then minced into small pieces. Minced tissues (∼0.15 g/ml in HBSS) were homogenized, and the protein concentration was determined by a modification of the Lowry method using the Sigma protein concentration assay kit. EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker EMX spectrometer with HS resonator operating at X-band. Measurements were performed at ambient temperature with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 2.5 G, microwave power of 20 milliwatt. NO formation was measured by spin trapping using the ferrous iron complex of MGD. Solid ferrous ammonium sulfate and MGD (molar ratio, 1:5) were added to the deoxygenated (argon-purged) PBS buffer with a final concentration of 0.1 mm in iron. Quantitation of NO formation and trapping were performed by double integration of the observed EPR signal with comparison with that from a similar aqueous NO-Fe-MGD standard (24.Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16939-16946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The rate of NO production was measured using a Sievers 270B NO analyzer interfaced through a DT2821 A to D board to a personal computer. In the analyzer, NO is reacted with ozone-forming excited-state NO2, which emits light. Mixing of reagents and purging of NO from the reaction mixture were done at controlled temperature in a glass-purging vessel equipped with heating jacket and pressure monitoring device, which allowed maintaining atmospheric pressure inside the purging vessel within limits of 1 mm Hg by keeping water levels at the same height via adjustment of in and out gas flow valves as described by our previous investigations (21.Li H.

The release of NO was quantified by analysis of the digitally recorded signal from the photomultiplier tube using specially designed data acquisition and analysis software developed in our laboratory. After an initial 30-s equilibration of the flow from the purging vessel to the detector, the signal provides the rate of NO formation over time (36.Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Calibration of the magnitude of NO production was determined from the integral of the signal over time compared with that from nitrite concentration standards (23.Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24.Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Compared with measurements performed with argon (100%), the efficiency of NO measurement with air or 10, 5, 2, and 1% oxygen/nitrogen was 92.0, 92.7, 96.6, 98.8, and 99.2% respectively. Results showed that the chemiluminescence linearly increased with NO generation when purging with any of these gas mixtures (γ2 >99%) (24.Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16939-16946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) was measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay. After incubation of liver homogenates (10 mg/ml protein) or AO (0.01 mg/ml), NADH or aldehyde with 10 μm nitrite, and with 1 ml of reaction buffer (10 ng sGC, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GTP in 1 ml PBS) at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions, the protein in the samples was removed by a Millipore filter (centrifuged 2000 × g, 10 min, at 4 °C). The measurements of cGMP in the solution were performed by immunoassay using direct cGMP assay kit according to the manufacturer's product protocol. The standard curve was obtained with known amounts of cGMP. Values are expressed as the mean of at least three repeated measurements and reported ± S.D., unless noted otherwise. Statistical significance of difference was evaluated by Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. To investigate AO-mediated NO generation from nitrite, studies were performed using a chemiluminescence NO analyzer. NO was purged from the solution by argon and then reacted with ozone in the analyzer to form excited-state NO2, which emits light. This method provides direct measurement of the rate of NO generation as a function of time. Prior to the addition of AO, no detectable NO generation was seen from nitrite (1 mm) in the presence of DMAC (50 μm) or NADH (100 μm) (Fig. 1, A, trace b, and B, trace b). However, after addition of AO (0.01 mg/ml), prominent NO generation was triggered (Fig. 1, A, trace a, and B, trace a). AO exhibits broad specificity, accepting a variety of reducing substrates. AO has a high affinity (low Km) for aldehydes and NADH, which are found in all living cells (32.Krenitsky T.A. Neil S.M. Elion G.B. Hitchings G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To further quantitate the rates of NO generation from nitrite in the presence of physiological levels of these typical AO-reducing substrates, EPR spectroscopy was applied to directly measure NO generation under anaerobic conditions. 15NO generated from [15N]nitrite is paramagnetic and binds with high affinity to the water-soluble spin trap Fe2+-MGD forming the mononitrosyl iron complex that exhibits a characteristic doublet 15NO-Fe2+-MGD spectrum, rather than the triplet observed with natural abundance 14NO, enabling direct and selective detection of nitrite-derived NO formation. From the intensity of the observed spectrum, quantitative measurement of NO generation can be performed (12.Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 27.Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10994-10998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of nitrite, with mixture of AO (0.04 mg/ml) and its reducing substrate DMAC or NADH, no signal was observed (Fig. 2A). With nitrite (100 μm) and DMAC or NADH also no signal was seen (Fig. 2B). However, upon addition of AO, a marked 15NO-Fe2+-MGD signal appeared (Fig. 2C). Over 10 min, 4.8 ± 0.6 μm NO generation was detected with DMAC (Fig. 2C) or 3.2 ± 0.4 μm with NADH (Fig. 2D) as electron donor. Thus, typical AO-reducing substrates were able to act as electron donors for AO-catalyzed nitrite reduction and triggered large levels of NO generation under anaerobic conditions. Further measurements of NO generation from pathophysiological levels of nitrite with DMAC and NADH as reducing substrates were performed using a chemiluminescence NO analyzer. With nitrite alone (100 μm) or nitrite in the presence of DMAC (50 μm) or NADH (100 μm), no measurable rate of NO generation was observed (Fig. 3, trace d). However, with the addition of AO in the presence of molybdenum site-binding reducing substrate DMAC (50 μm) (Fig. 3A) or flavin site electron donor NADH (100 μm) (Fig. 3B), prominent NO formation was triggered from 10, 50, or 100 μm nitrite under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 3). To further characterize the mechanism and magnitude of AO-mediated NO formation, kinetic studies of the effects of nitrite concentration on the magnitude of NO generation were performed. The rate of NO formation derived from nitrite reduction was measured under anaerobic conditions using the NO analyzer. Following addition of nitrite (0.01–10 mm), prominent generation of NO was detected from AO with 100 μm NADH (Fig. 4A) or 50 μm DMAC (Fig. 4B) as electron donor. Typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed as a function of nitrite concentration, and the apparent Km and Vmax values are shown inside each curve. The concentration dependence for reducing substrates was also determined in the presence of a fixed nitrite concentration, 1 mm. Each of the typical reducing substrates NADH and DMAC acted as electron donors to support AO-catalyzed nitrite reduction. Again, typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed (Fig. 4, C and D), and the apparent values of Km and Vmax were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The values for each reducing substrate are shown inside each curve. From these data, it is possible to predict the magnitude of AO-catalyzed NO formation as a function of nitrite concentration in the presence of physiological levels of endogenous AO-reducing substrates and to further determine the quantitative importance of this mechanism of NO generation in a given biological system where AO substrate levels are known. The effects of site-specific inhibitors of AO were studied to investigate the reaction sites involved in the process of the AO-mediated nitrite reduction with different reducing substrates (Fig. 5). Raloxifene binds to the molybdenum site of AO. It was observed that raloxifene inhibited AO-mediated nitrite reduction regardless of the type of reducing substrate present (Fig. 5C). Near total inhibition of NO generation was seen in the presence of either DMAC or NADH. Because raloxifene inhibits substrate binding at the molybdenum site of the enzyme, this suggests that nitrite binds to the reduced molybdenum site. DPI, which acts at the FAD site, inhibited AO-mediated nitrite reduction only when NADH was used as the reducing substrate, and it did not inhibit NO generation when DMAC was used (Fig. 5B). This suggests that NADH donates electrons to FAD, and then electrons are transported back to reduce the molybdenum that in turn reduces nitrite to NO. With the aldehyde electron donor DMAC, both AO reduction by the aldehyde and oxidation by nitrite take place at the molybdenum site. Under ischemic conditions, marked intracellular acidosis occurs, and pH values in tissues, such as the heart, can fall to levels of 6.0 or below (12.Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). To assess NO generation from nitrite under different physiological or pathological conditions and to further characterize the mechanism of AO-catalyzed nitrite reduction, experiments were performed to measure the effect of pH on the magnitude of NO generation from nitrite. Measurements were performed with 0.01 mg/ml AO in the presence of 100 μm nitrite. As shown in Table 1, it was observed that maximum AO-catalyzed NO generation occurs at pH 6.0. When the pH was decreased to 5.0 or increased above 8.0, a decrease in the rate of NO generation was observed.TABLE 1Effect of pH on NO generation from nitrite reductionpH 5.0pH 6.0pH 7.4pH 8.0NO generation rate (nmol/s·unit)aThe maximal NO generation rates were measured by chemiluminescence NO analyzer as described in Fig. 2. Measurements were performed with 0.01 mg/ml AO in the presence of 100 μm nitrite and reducing substrate under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C. Values are mean ± S.D.DMAC (50 μm)0.17 ± 0.010.56 ± 0.090.41 ± 0.060.35 ± 0.04NADH (100 μm)0.15 ± 0.010.46 ± 0.110.34 ± 0.050.28 ± 0.03a The maximal NO generation rates were measured by chemiluminescence NO analyzer as described in Fig. 2. Measurements were performed with 0.01 mg/ml AO in the presence of 100 μm nitrite and reducing substrate under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C. Values are mean ± S.D. Open table in a new tab To quantitatively describe the effect of oxygen and further investigate the mechanism of AO-mediated nitrite reduction, chemiluminescence measurements of the rate of NO production were performed using molybdenum site electron donor DMAC and flavin site electron donor NADH under different oxygen tensions. NO formation from AO-catalyzed nitrite reduction was measured with continuous purging with air, 10, 5, 2, or 1% oxygen, corresponding to oxygen concentrations in solution at 37 °C of 214, 102, 51, 20, and 10 μm, respectively. DMAC provides electrons to AO at the molybdenum site, the same site of nitrite binding to the enzyme. For DAMC as reducing substrate, the rate of AO-mediated NO formation from 1 mm nitrite was decreased with the increase of oxygen, and competitive inhibition was observed (Fig. 6A). With the determined Vmax = 13.5 nmol·s−1·units−1 and Km = 3.3 mm as shown in Fig. 4B, the inhibition constant Ki of oxygen on AO-mediated nitrite reduction was calculated to be 3.8 μm, as obtained from fitting to Equation 1 (γ2 > 0.95), V[NO]=VmaxKm(1+[O2]Ki)+[nitrite](Eq. 1) NADH reacts with AO at the FAD site of the enzyme. With NADH as electron donor and purging with air, 10, 5, 2, or 1% oxygen, the oxygen does show typical competitive inhibition kinetics. For 1 mm nitrite with AO (0.01 mg/ml), NADH (100 mm), and superoxide dismutase (500 units/ml) for reactions in argon, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 21% oxygen, the rates of NO generation were 2.61 ± 0.34, 2.47 ± 0.24, 2.13 ± 0.17, 1.47 ± 0.15, 1.27 ± 0.11, and 1.13 ± 0.09 nmol·s−1·units−1, respectively (Fig. 6B). The rate of NO generation decreased with the increase of pO2 when NADH was the reducing substrate; however, even in air, prominent NO production was still present. NO exerts a large number of important regulatory biological functions, including vascular smooth muscle relaxation, neuronal signal transduction, and inhibition of platelet aggregation. The principal receptor for NO is sGC, which catalyzes the conversion of GTP to the second messenger molecule cGMP. To determine the effect of nitrite reduction on sGC activation, enzyme-linked immunoassays were performed to measure cGMP formation. After incubation of nitrite (10 μm) with NADH or DMAC in the presence or absence of AO in the reaction buffer (10 ng of sGC, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GTP in 1 ml of PBS) under anaerobic conditions for 10 min, measurements of the formation of the sGC product cGMP were performed. With 10 μm nitrite and 100 μm NADH or 50 μm DMAC in the reaction buffer in the absence of AO, no significant cGMP formation was detected. In the presence of AO (0.01 mg/ml), significant sGC activation was triggered by nitrite (10 μm) with either NADH (100 μm) or DMAC (50 μm) as electron donor (Fig. 7). To further acc"
https://openalex.org/W2053727265,"Recent evidence suggests that signaling by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is dependent on reactive oxygen species derived from NADPH oxidase. Redox signaling in response to IL-1beta is known to require endocytosis of its cognate receptor (IL-1R1) following ligand binding and the formation of redox-active signaling endosomes that contain Nox2 (also called redoxosomes). The consequent generation of reactive oxygen species by redoxosomes is responsible for the downstream recruitment of IL-1R1 effectors (IRAK, TRAF6, and IkappaB kinase kinases) and ultimately for activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB. Despite this knowledge of the signaling events that occur downstream of redoxosome formation, an understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate the genesis of redoxosomes following IL-1beta stimulation has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate that lipid rafts play an important role in this process. We show that Nox2 and IL-1R1 localize to plasma membrane lipid rafts in the unstimulated state and that IL-1beta signals caveolin-1-dependent endocytosis of both proteins into the redoxosome. We also show that inhibiting lipid raft-mediated endocytosis prevents NFkappaB activation. Finally, we demonstrate that Vav1, a Rac1 guanine exchange factor and activator of Nox2, is recruited to lipid rafts following IL-1beta stimulation and that it is required for NFkappaB activation. Our results fill in an important mechanistic gap in the understanding of early IL-1R1 and Nox2 signaling events that control NFkappaB activation, a redox-dependent process important in inflammation."

Its effects are mainly mediated through transcriptional regulation by T3 receptor (TR). The identification and characterization of the immediate early, direct target genes are thus of critical importance in understanding the molecular pathways induced by T3. Unfortunately, this has been hampered by the difficulty to study gene regulation by T3 in uterus-enclosed mammalian embryos. Here we used Xenopus metamorphosis as a model for vertebrate postembryonic development to identify direct T3 response genes in vivo. We took advantage of the ability to easily induce metamorphosis with physiological levels of T3 and to carry out microarray analysis in Xenopus laevis and genome-wide sequence analysis in Xenopus tropicalis. This allowed us to identify 188 up-regulated and 249 down-regulated genes by T3 in the absence of new protein synthesis in whole animals. We further provide evidence to show that these genes contain functional TREs that are bound by TR in tadpoles and that their promoters are regulated by TR in vivo. More importantly, gene ontology analysis showed that the direct up-regulated genes are enriched in categories important for transcriptional regulation and protein degradation-dependent signaling processes but not DNA replication.

T3 deficiency during development leads to severe developmental defects in mammals, including cretinism in human, which is characterized by severe short stature and mental retardation (5.Hetzel B.S. The Story of Iodine Deficiency: An International Challenge in Nutrition. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). During early mammalian development, there is little T3 in the fetus, although some maternal T3 reaches the embryo. High levels of T3 are present only during the so-called postembryonic period, which spans from several months prior to birth to several months after birth in human (3.Tata J.R. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10.Howdeshell K.L. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This is a critical period of organ growth and maturation, and thus, not surprisingly, T3 deficiency during this period causes severe developmental defects (5.Hetzel B.S. The Story of Iodine Deficiency: An International Challenge in Nutrition. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar, 11.Porterfield S.P. Hendrich C.E. Endocr.

Interestingly, appropriate levels of maternal T3 are also important to ensure proper mammalian development (13.de Escobar G.M. Obregón M.J. del Rey F.E. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol.

JAMA. 2004; 292: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that proper levels of T3 in both the mother and fetus are critical for mammalian development, which makes it difficult to separate the direct effects of T3 on the development of the fetus versus indirect effects through maternal influence. Furthermore, there are only a limited number of known direct T3 response genes in different model systems, and no systematic analysis has been carried out to isolate such genes in development. All these have hampered our understanding of how T3 regulates development in vivo.Amphibian metamorphosis is a postembryonic process that is also dependent on T3 (4.Shi Y.B.

Metamorphosis: Post-embryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Studies in anurans such as Xenopus laevis in the past century have shown that T3 controls every aspect of metamorphosis and is both necessary and sufficient (9.Shi Y.B.

Endocrinol. 2006; 145: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). During metamorphosis, different tissues have different fates (4.Shi Y.B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 17.Brown D.D. Cai L. Dev. Biol. 2007; 306: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For example, the tail and gills undergo resorption, the brain, skin, intestine, and other visceral organs undergo remodeling while the limbs are generated de novo. All these changes are controlled by T3 in mostly organ-autonomous manner.T3 action is primarily mediated through thyroid receptors (TRs), which are transcription factors and are members of nuclear receptor superfamily (1.Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 2.Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 9.Shi Y.B.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). TRs bind to chromosomal sites in the promoter regions (known as thyroid response elements (TRE)) of direct response genes of T3. For T3-inducible genes, these binding sites are often composed of two direct repeats of the consensus sequence AGGTCA with a 4-bp spacer sequence. TR functions mainly as a heterodimer with 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) at these TREs and represses and activates these genes by recruiting corepressor and coactivator complexes in the absence or presence of T3, respectively.We have previously proposed a dual function model for TR function during anuran metamorphosis (22.Shi Y.B. Wong J. Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Stolow M.A. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23.Sachs L.M. Damjanovski S. Jones P.L. Li Q. Amano T. Ueda S. Shi Y.B. Ishizuya-Oka A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). According to this model, in the absence of T3, TR/RXR heterodimers repress direct target genes to ensure proper growth of the premetamorphic tadpoles and prevent premature metamorphic organ transformations. In the presence of T3, TR/RXR heterodimers activate these target genes to initiate metamorphosis. Over the years, studies by us and others have shown that TRs are both necessary and sufficient to mediate the metamorphic effects of T3 in X. laevis (9.Shi Y.B. Thyroid. 2009; 19: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19.Buchholz D.R. Paul B.D. Fu L. Shi Y.B. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2006; 145: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus all the remarkable morphological and developmental changes in the different tissues are effected through gene expression cascades initiated by TRs. Furthermore, TRs indeed have dual functions during metamorphosis. They recruit corepressor complexes in premetamorphic tadpoles to control metamorphic timing and recruit coactivator complexes to initiate metamorphosis (24.Paul B.D. Fu L. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.B. Mol.

In addition, the levels of coactivator complexes also regulate the rate of metamorphic progression (29.Matsuda H. Paul B.D. Choi C.Y. Hasebe T. Shi Y.B. Mol. Cell.

These studies have provided us with an understanding of the global gene expression changes and signaling pathways involved in metamorphosis. How these genes are regulated remains largely unknown, although a few have been shown to be direct target genes of TRs (34.Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3295-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 36.Fu L. Tomita A.

Metamorphosis: Post-embryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells.in: Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Here we have made use of the recent advances in microarray analysis of gene expression in X. laevis and genomic sequencing in the highly related species Xenopus tropicalis to systematically identify direct target genes of T3, which are likely key players in propagating the effects of T3 in regulating metamorphosis. This is made possible in part by the fact that X. laevis and X. tropicalis undergo essentially identical T3-dependent metamorphosis. In addition, TR and RXR genes are regulated and function similarly in both species during development (39.Wang X. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 5610-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As the regulation of immediate early, direct TR target genes by T3 should be independent of new protein synthesis, to identify these direct targets, we treated premetamorphic X. laevis tadpoles with T3 to induce metamorphosis and included protein synthesis inhibitors to block the synthesis of new proteins. We identified the resulting T3 response genes by using an X. laevis microarray. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes are enriched in categories important for the earliest steps of cellular transformations during metamorphosis. To determine whether these genes are regulated by TR directly at the transcriptional level, we then carried out bioinformatics analysis of the homologous genes in X. tropicalis followed by in vitro DNA binding studies. These results showed that essentially all of the genes had one or more functional TREs in and around their promoters. More importantly, we demonstrated that TR was bound to these TREs in tadpoles and regulated their promoters in vivo. Thus, our studies not only identified many direct TR target genes in vivo but also revealed a number of signaling transduction pathways that are regulated by T3 as the first step toward inducing metamorphosis.DISCUSSIONT3 regulates diverse developmental processes and organ function and metabolisms in different vertebrate species. Although non-genomic actions of T3 undoubtedly contribute to some of the biological effects of T3 (58.Davis P.J. Davis F.B. Thyroid. 1996; 6: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), TR is generally believed to be the main mediator of T3 action through transcriptional regulation. The immediate early, direct target genes of TR likely play critical roles to transduce the biological effects of T3. While a number of microarrays have been carried out to identify T3 response genes in different species, the T3-resposne genes identified from such studies include both immediate early, direct target genes of TR as well as downstream, late T3 response genes. Amphibian metamorphosis is an ideal model system to study T3 action in development because of its total dependence on T3 and the ability to easily manipulate this process without any potential complications of maternal effects as in mammals (3.Tata J.R. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 4.Shi Y.B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Furthermore, TR has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for the metamorphic effects of T3, suggesting an essential role of direct TR target genes in this process (9.Shi Y.B. Thyroid. 2009; 19: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17.Brown D.D. Cai L. Dev. Biol. 2007; 306: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 19.Buchholz D.R. Paul B.D. Fu L. Shi Y.B. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2006; 145: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Here, we have combined the advantages of two highly related frog species, microarray analysis in X. laevis and genome sequence information in X. tropicalis, to not only identify immediate early, direct target genes of T3 but also provide evidence to support their regulation by TR in developing tadpoles in vivo. Furthermore, our gene ontology analysis has revealed interesting pathways induced by T3 at the earliest stages of the metamorphic process.Our microarray analysis in X. laevis identified 188 genes up-regulated and 249 genes down-regulated by T3 in the absence of new protein synthesis. Interestingly, most of these genes were not found as T3 response genes in the absence of CHX during the 15-h treatment. Although the exact reasons remain to be determined, some possibilities include the following. First, CHX can stabilize some mRNAs (Fig. 3). This might have altered the magnitude of the changes for some genes. Some genes with the extent of T3 regulation near the 1.3-fold cut-off might change from being a regulated gene to being a non-regulated gene and vice versa in the presence of CHX. In addition, some of the T3-regulated genes might be expressed at very low levels and thus not detectable or with more variable signals on the microarray in the absence of CHX by the microarray. Upon stabilization by CHX, they were now detectable with more consistent signals as T3-regulated genes. Second, some of the genes regulated by T3 treatment alone were late response genes and were thus not regulated by T3 in the presence of CHX. Finally, undoubtedly some genes with a fold of regulation by T3 around the 1.3-fold cut-off might be missed in the T3 alone group or T3 plus CHX group due to some expected experimental variations. Thus, it is quite likely that most of the genes regulated by T3 in the presence of CHX are true T3 response genes during metamorphosis.The above conclusion is also supported by our studies in X. tropicalis, a closely related diploid species of X. laevis within the Xenopodinae subfamily of anurans. We have shown previously that TR and RXR genes are regulated and function similarly in X. tropicalis and X. laevis (39.Wang X. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 5610-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, of the a few direct TR target genes in X. laevis that have been analyzed in X. tropicalis, all are regulated by T3 similarly in X. tropicalis (39.Wang X. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 5610-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 3B. Das, R. A. Heimeier, D. R. Buchholz, and Y.-B. Shi, unpublished observation. Our studies here also indicate that the corresponding genes of the newly identified CHX-resistant T3 response genes in X. laevis are similarly regulated in X. tropicalis, supporting the idea that the T3-dependent gene regulation program is conserved between X. tropicalis and X. laevis.Furthermore, our bioinformatic search showed that of the 46 CHX-resistant T3-induced genes with clear homologs between X. laevis and X. tropicalis, 45 have candidate TREs within 2000 bp of their putative transcription start site. In addition, biochemical studies showed that, of the genes analyzed, each has at least one TRE capable of binding to the TR/RXR heterodimer strongly in vitro. More importantly, our in vivo ChIP assay has shown that TR is bound to the TREs of newly identified target genes in premetamorphic X. tropicalis tadpoles and that the binding to some of the TREs increases upon T3 treatment, just like that in X. laevis. By using the oocyte transcription system, we have further demonstrated that TR regulates the promoters of the newly identified genes in vivo in the context of chromatin. Thus, most, if not all, of the genes discovered here are likely directly regulated by TR during Xenopus development. These findings allowed us for the first time to generate a Xenopus consensus TRE based on a large number of biochemically characterized, natural occurring TREs. The consensus TRE and the degeneracy identified here should help to refine future searches for TREs in other TR target genes by using position-specific probability matrix (MEME) (60.Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1994: 28-36Google Scholar). Of particular interest in this regard is the identification of direct target genes of T3 in different metamorphosing tissues, which are likely important to dictate tissue-specific transformations, an area that we are currently pursuing.Our microarray analysis showed that only a small fraction of genes was commonly regulated by T3 in the absence or presence of CHX. One reason is that the genes regulated by T3 alone likely include both immediate early, direct T3 response genes, which are CHX-resistant T3 response genes, and late, downstream T3 response genes. Thus, one would expect that the biological functions of the genes regulated by T3 in the absence of CHX and those in the presence of CHX would also only partially overlap. Indeed, our GO categories analysis revealed that there are a number of GO categories overlapping between the genes induced by T3 alone and those induced by T3 in the presence of CHX. On the other hand, there are few common GO categories between the down-regulated genes by T3 alone and those by T3 in the presence of CHX, consistent with the much fewer common down-regulated genes under the two conditions (Fig. 2).The direct T3 response genes (regulated by T3 in the presence of CHX) are enriched in GO categories related to transcriptional regulation, such as transcription factors (Table 3 and supplemental Table 5). Some of these transcription factors have been reported previously as direct targets of T3, such as TRβ and TH/bZIP (34.Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3295-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 65.Ishizuya-Oka A. Ueda S. Shi Y.B. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GO categories related to transcriptional regulation are not significantly enriched in the genes regulated by T3 alone, likely because of the presence of many late, downstream response genes in this case. These results support the idea that a transcription factor-mediated gene regulation cascade plays an important role in metamorphosis and suggest that the earliest members of the gene expression pathways leading to subsequent morphological changes involve a disproportionately larger fraction of transcription factors.Another GO category specifically enriched in the direct T3 target genes is metallopeptidases (Table 3 and supplemental Table 5). This suggests that the remodeling of the extracellular matrix and other protein degradation events are important early signaling events induced by T3 during metamorphosis. In fact, one of the first T3 direct response genes found during metamorphosis is stromelysin-3 (MMP-11) (36.Fu L. Tomita A. Wang H. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16870-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 66.Shi Y.B. Brown D.D. J. Biol.

Thus, signaling processes triggered through the action of metallopeptidases are another important early event toward regulating cell fate and behavior during metamorphosis.In addition, our GO analysis revealed the enrichment of categories related to cell cycle and DNA replication in the genes induced by T3 alone and/or by T3 in the presence of CHX. Interestingly, whereas cell cycle categories were enriched in the direct target genes, DNA replication categories were enriched in the genes induced by T3 alone. These suggest that, in the absence of protein synthesis, T3 may induce cell cycle changes. The direct target genes by themselves, however, are not sufficient for DNA replication but rather prepare the cells to enter the S-phase. This is strongly supported by the enrichment of G1/S phase transition genes but the absence of DNA replication genes, e.g. the MCM genes involved in replication fork (72.Ryu S. Driever W. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1140-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in the direct T3 target genes (Table 3 and supplemental Table 5). Likewise, the absence of the GO categories, related to ribosomal biogenesis and assembly in the CHX-resistant T3 response genes, and their presence in the genes induced by T3 alone, suggest the possibility that downstream genes are required to sustain cell proliferation. Undoubtedly, it would be of importance in the future to investigate the function of the direct target genes to test these predictions.

T3 deficiency during development leads to severe developmental defects in mammals, including cretinism in human, which is characterized by severe short stature and mental retardation (5.Hetzel B.S. The Story of Iodine Deficiency: An International Challenge in Nutrition. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). During early mammalian development, there is little T3 in the fetus, although some maternal T3 reaches the embryo. High levels of T3 are present only during the so-called postembryonic period, which spans from several months prior to birth to several months after birth in human (3.Tata J.R. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10.Howdeshell K.L. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This is a critical period of organ growth and maturation, and thus, not surprisingly, T3 deficiency during this period causes severe developmental defects (5.Hetzel B.S. The Story of Iodine Deficiency: An International Challenge in Nutrition. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar, 11.Porterfield S.P. Hendrich C.E. Endocr.

Interestingly, appropriate levels of maternal T3 are also important to ensure proper mammalian development (13.de Escobar G.M. Obregón M.J. del Rey F.E. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 18: 225-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 14.de Escobar G.M. Obregón M.J. del Rey F.E.

JAMA. 2004; 292: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that proper levels of T3 in both the mother and fetus are critical for mammalian development, which makes it difficult to separate the direct effects of T3 on the development of the fetus versus indirect effects through maternal influence. Furthermore, there are only a limited number of known direct T3 response genes in different model systems, and no systematic analysis has been carried out to isolate such genes in development. All these have hampered our understanding of how T3 regulates development in vivo.Amphibian metamorphosis is a postembryonic process that is also dependent on T3 (4.Shi Y.B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 16.Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G. Metamorphosis: Post-embryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Studies in anurans such as Xenopus laevis in the past century have shown that T3 controls every aspect of metamorphosis and is both necessary and sufficient (9.Shi Y.B. Thyroid. 2009; 19: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17.Brown D.D. Cai L. Dev. Biol. 2007; 306: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 18.Buchholz D.R. Tomita A. Fu L.

Endocrinol. 2006; 145: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). During metamorphosis, different tissues have different fates (4.Shi Y.B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 17.Brown D.D. Cai L. Dev. Biol. 2007; 306: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For example, the tail and gills undergo resorption, the brain, skin, intestine, and other visceral organs undergo remodeling while the limbs are generated de novo. All these changes are controlled by T3 in mostly organ-autonomous manner.T3 action is primarily mediated through thyroid receptors (TRs), which are transcription factors and are members of nuclear receptor superfamily (1.Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 2.Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 9.Shi Y.B. Thyroid. 2009; 19: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19.Buchholz D.R. Paul B.D. Fu L. Shi Y.B. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2006; 145: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar, 21.Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). TRs bind to chromosomal sites in the promoter regions (known as thyroid response elements (TRE)) of direct response genes of T3. For T3-inducible genes, these binding sites are often composed of two direct repeats of the consensus sequence AGGTCA with a 4-bp spacer sequence. TR functions mainly as a heterodimer with 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) at these TREs and represses and activates these genes by recruiting corepressor and coactivator complexes in the absence or presence of T3, respectively.We have previously proposed a dual function model for TR function during anuran metamorphosis (22.Shi Y.B. Wong J. Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Stolow M.A. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23.Sachs L.M. Damjanovski S. Jones P.L. Li Q. Amano T. Ueda S. Shi Y.B. Ishizuya-Oka A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). According to this model, in the absence of T3, TR/RXR heterodimers repress direct target genes to ensure proper growth of the premetamorphic tadpoles and prevent premature metamorphic organ transformations. In the presence of T3, TR/RXR heterodimers activate these target genes to initiate metamorphosis. Over the years, studies by us and others have shown that TRs are both necessary and sufficient to mediate the metamorphic effects of T3 in X. laevis (9.Shi Y.B. Thyroid. 2009; 19: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19.Buchholz D.R. Paul B.D. Fu L. Shi Y.B. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2006; 145: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus all the remarkable morphological and developmental changes in the different tissues are effected through gene expression cascades initiated by TRs. Furthermore, TRs indeed have dual functions during metamorphosis. They recruit corepressor complexes in premetamorphic tadpoles to control metamorphic timing and recruit coactivator complexes to initiate metamorphosis (24.Paul B.D. Fu L. Buchholz D.R. Shi Y.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5712-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25.Havis E. Sachs L.M. Demeneix B.A. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26.Sato Y.

In addition, the levels of coactivator complexes also regulate the rate of metamorphic progression (29.Matsuda H. Paul B.D. Choi C.Y. Hasebe T. Shi Y.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 745-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Using subtractive hybridization screening and microarrays, we and others have previously documented the differentially expressed genes in different organs during both T3-induced and natural metamorphosis (4.Shi Y.B.

These studies have provided us with an understanding of the global gene expression changes and signaling pathways involved in metamorphosis. How these genes are regulated remains largely unknown, although a few have been shown to be direct target genes of TRs (34.Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3295-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 36.Fu L. Tomita A.

Metamorphosis: Post-embryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells.in: Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Here we have made use of the recent advances in microarray analysis of gene expression in X. laevis and genomic sequencing in the highly related species Xenopus tropicalis to systematically identify direct target genes of T3, which are likely key players in propagating the effects of T3 in regulating metamorphosis. This is made possible in part by the fact that X. laevis and X. tropicalis undergo essentially identical T3-dependent metamorphosis. In addition, TR and RXR genes are regulated and function similarly in both species during development (39.Wang X. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 5610-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As the regulation of immediate early, direct TR target genes by T3 should be independent of new protein synthesis, to identify these direct targets, we treated premetamorphic X. laevis tadpoles with T3 to induce metamorphosis and included protein synthesis inhibitors to block the synthesis of new proteins. We identified the resulting T3 response genes by using an X. laevis microarray. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes are enriched in categories important for the earliest steps of cellular transformations during metamorphosis. To determine whether these genes are regulated by TR directly at the transcriptional level, we then carried out bioinformatics analysis of the homologous genes in X. tropicalis followed by in vitro DNA binding studies. These results showed that essentially all of the genes had one or more functional TREs in and around their promoters. More importantly, we demonstrated that TR was bound to these TREs in tadpoles and regulated their promoters in vivo. Thus, our studies not only identified many direct TR target genes in vivo but also revealed a number of signaling transduction pathways that are regulated by T3 as the first step toward inducing metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2047519206,"We expressed full-length Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchangers (NCXs) with mutations in two Ca(2+)-binding domains (CBD1 and CBD2) to determine the roles of the CBDs in Ca(2+)-dependent regulation of NCX. CBD1 has four Ca(2+)-binding sites, and mutation of residues Asp(421) and Glu(451), which primarily coordinate Ca(2+) at sites 1 and 2, had little effect on regulation of NCX by Ca(2+). In contrast, mutations at residues Glu(385), Asp(446), Asp(447), and Asp(500), which coordinate Ca(2+) at sites 3 and 4 of CBD1, resulted in a drastic decrease in the apparent affinity of peak exchange current for regulatory Ca(2+). Another mutant, M7, with 7 key residues of CBD1 replaced, showed a further decrease in apparent Ca(2+) affinity but retained regulation, confirming a contribution of CBD2 to Ca(2+) regulation. Addition of the mutation K585E (located in CBD2) into the M7 background induced a marked increase in Ca(2+) affinity for both steady-state and peak currents. Also, we have shown previously that the CBD2 mutations E516L and E683V have no Ca(2+)-dependent regulation. We now demonstrate that introduction of a positive charge at these locations rescues Ca(2+)-dependent regulation. Finally, our data demonstrate that deletion of the unstructured loops between beta-strands F and G of both CBDs does not alter the regulation of the exchanger by Ca(2+), indicating that these segments are not important in regulation. Thus, CBD1 and CBD2 have distinct roles in Ca(2+)-dependent regulation of NCX. CBD1 determines the affinity of NCX for regulatory Ca(2+), although CBD2 is also necessary for Ca(2+)-dependent regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2087420232,"Enveloped viruses enter cells by viral glycoprotein-mediated binding to host cells and subsequent fusion of virus and host cell membranes. For the coronaviruses, viral spike (S) proteins execute these cell entry functions. The S proteins are set apart from other viral and cellular membrane fusion proteins by their extensively palmitoylated membrane-associated tails. Palmitate adducts are generally required for protein-mediated fusions, but their precise roles in the process are unclear. To obtain additional insights into the S-mediated membrane fusion process, we focused on these acylated carboxyl-terminal intravirion tails. Substituting alanines for the cysteines that are subject to palmitoylation had effects on both S incorporation into virions and S-mediated membrane fusions. In specifically dissecting the effects of endodomain mutations on the fusion process, we used antiviral heptad repeat peptides that bind only to folding intermediates in the S-mediated fusion process and found that mutants lacking three palmitoylated cysteines remained in transitional folding states nearly 10 times longer than native S proteins. This slower refolding was also reflected in the paucity of postfusion six-helix bundle configurations among the mutant S proteins. Viruses with fewer palmitoylated S protein cysteines entered cells slowly and had reduced specific infectivities. These findings indicate that lipid adducts anchoring S proteins into virus membranes are necessary for the rapid, productive S protein refolding events that culminate in membrane fusions. These studies reveal a previously unappreciated role for covalently attached lipids on the endodomains of viral proteins eliciting membrane fusion reactions.

https://openalex.org/W1981607442,"cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) activation represents a key signaling mechanism upon beta-adrenergic stimulation under stress. Both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoreceptor (ARs) subtypes induce cAMP accumulation, yet play distinct roles in cardiac contraction and myocyte apoptosis. Differences in controlling cAMP/PKA activities through the assembly of complexes between the receptors and cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases contribute to the distinct biological outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that beta(2)ARs form signaling complexes with a set of PDE4D isoforms expressed in cardiac myocytes. PDE4D9 and PDE4D8 bind to the beta(2)AR at resting conditions; however, agonist stimulation induces dissociation of PDE4D9 from the receptor but recruitment of PDE4D8 to the receptor. Agonist stimulation also induces recruitment of PDE4D5 to the beta(2)AR. Moreover, the receptor-associated PDE4D isoforms play distinct roles in controlling cAMP activities and regulating the PKA phosphorylation of the receptor and myocyte contraction rate responses. Knockdown of PDE4D9 with short hairpin RNA enhances the beta(2)AR-induced cAMP signaling, whereas knockdown of PDE4D8 only slightly prolongs the receptor-induced cAMP signaling in myocytes. Inhibition of PDE4D9 and PDE4D5 enhances the base-line levels of contraction rates, whereas inhibition of PDE4D9 and PDE4D8 enhances the maximal contraction rate increases upon activation of beta(2)AR. Our data underscore the complex regulation of intracellular cAMP by beta(2)AR-associated phosphodiesterase enzymes to enforce the specificity of the receptor signaling for physiological responses."

We present the crystal structure of the full-length and sole cAMP phosphodiesterase, Rv0805, found in M. tuberculosis, whose orthologs are present only in the genomes of slow growing and pathogenic mycobacteria. The dimeric core catalytic domain of Rv0805 adopts a metallophosphoesterase-fold, and the C-terminal region builds the active site and contributes to multiple substrate utilization. Localization of Rv0805 to the cell wall is dependent on its C terminus, and expression of either wild type or mutationally inactivated Rv0805 in M. smegmatis alters cell permeability to hydrophobic cytotoxic compounds. Rv0805 may therefore play a key role in the pathogenicity of mycobacteria, not only by hydrolyzing bacterial cAMP, but also by moonlighting as a protein that can alter cell wall functioning.

Binding of mitochondrially released cytochrome c and of dATP or ATP to Apaf-1 induces the formation of the heptameric apoptosome complex, which in turn activates procaspase-9. We have re-investigated the chain of events leading from monomeric autoinhibited Apaf-1 to the functional apoptosome in vitro. We demonstrate that Apaf-1 does not require energy from nucleotide hydrolysis to eventually form the apoptosome. Despite a low intrinsic hydrolytic activity of the autoinhibited Apaf-1 monomer, nucleotide hydrolysis does not occur at any stage of the process. Rather, mere binding of ATP in concert with the binding of cytochrome c primes Apaf-1 for assembly.

The exact nature of the ligand in the Niu-A state is still under discussion (29.Lubitz W. Reijerse E. van Gastel M. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4331-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In these oxidized states, the enzyme is inactive but can be activated by reduction with hydrogen. Upon activation the oxygen ligand is removed (36.Garcin E. Vernede X. Hatchikian E.C. Volbeda A.

Nir-B activation takes place within a time frame spanning from seconds to minutes, whereas the Niu-A state requires hours (4.De Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Rousset M. Cammack R. Chem.

In one-electron reactions these states are converted to their respective reduced states, Niu-S and Nir-S, which are also catalytically inactive, but EPR-silent. All redox states can be distinguished by FTIR spectroscopy via their characteristic band positions of the CO and CN stretching vibrations (4.De Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Rousset M. Cammack R. Chem.

It is proposed that at least three of the various redox states identified in [NiFe] hydrogenases are directly involved in the catalytic cleavage and formation of H2. Nia-S (EPR-silent) is the most oxidized that is converted by reduction to the intermediate Nia-C (EPR-active), which is then fully reduced to Nia-SR (EPR-silent). Each of the one-electron reduction steps is accompanied by a proton transfer step. Although nickel cycles between diamagnetic +II and paramagnetic +III states, the iron in the active site remains in its valence state during catalysis (25.Surerus K.K. Chen M. van der Zwaan J.W.

The bidirectional, soluble NAD+- reducing hydrogenase from Re H16 (SH) is a close relative of the cyanobacterial bidirectional hydrogenase and the best characterized of its class. For this enzyme a non-standard coordination of the active [NiFe] site was proposed with one additional cyanide ligand bound to each iron and nickel (15.Happe R.P. Roseboom W. Egert G. Friedrich C.G.

The protein was activated by hydrogen in the presence of catalytic amounts of NADH or NADPH (16.Van der Linden E. Burgdorf T. Bernhard M. Bleijlevens B. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 9: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, no evidence of paramagnetic nickel species could be detected by EPR spectroscopy (16.Van der Linden E.

However, in some enzyme preparations significant amounts of Nia-C could also be induced electrochemically or by an excess of NADH or dithionite (39.van der Linden E. Burgdorf T. de Lacey A.L.

Oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms are a matter of intense interest for the production of hydrogen by solar power. The bidirectional hydrogenase is the enzyme naturally involved in this process in cyanobacteria (10.Appel J. Phunpruch S. Steinmüller K. Schulz R. Arch.

PCC 6803 and the first characterization of the enzymes active site and its iron-sulfur centers by a combination of FTIR and EPR spectroscopy. The wild type strains Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, and the Synechocystis mutants were grown in BG-11 (40.Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) supplemented with 5 mm TES, pH 8, at 28 °C and 50 μE m−2 s−1 bubbled with air. For purification, Synechocystis mutant strain E3 was cultured in 5-liter glass bottles. The cells were harvested at 20 min by centrifugation at 6,000 × g. DNA cloning and PCR amplification were performed using standard procedures (41.Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). All primer sequences used during the cloning procedure are listed in Table 1. To insert a psbAII promoter upstream of the hoxE gene from Synechocystis, a PCR product was amplified using the primer pairs E-out1/E-in1 and E-in2/E-out2. The gentamycin cassette that had been amplified with primers Gm1 and Gm2 was then fused to these two PCR products as described (42.Hoffmann D. Gutekunst K. Klissenbauer M. Schulz-Friedrich R. Appel J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4516-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The resulting product was ligated into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen). In the final step this vector was cut by KpnI and NdeI, and the psbAII promoter of pDH1 (42.Hoffmann D. Gutekunst K. Klissenbauer M. Schulz-Friedrich R. Appel J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4516-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was excised with the same enzymes and inserted into these sites.TABLE 1Primer sequences used during cloning proceduresPrimerSequence 5′–3′Anahyp1CATATGGCGACTGAGGAAATTCGAnahyp2TAGCTAGTCGACGATTAAGGAAAAACTGGTACE-in1GGTTCGTGCCTTCATCCGTCGACTGATTGGGAGAGCCTAAACCE-out1TCTGAGCGATGAACTGAGAAACE-in2TACCGCCACCTAACAATTCGGTACCAGGATTTTCATATGACCGTTGCCACE-out2AACTGTTACTTAACCAAGGTTGGm1GTCGACGGATGAAGGCACGAACCGm2GTCGACGAATTGTTAGGTGGCGHoxF-in1GAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAGCTAGCGACTTTGAGTAATTCTTCATAHoxF-out1CTTTTTAGAAGGGGAAGCTAHoxF-in2GAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAGAAATAGTTCGGATCCTTATCCACTCAGTTAHoxF-out2CAGTGGCTTGGATAAATTCT Open table in a new tab For construction of the Strep-tag II mutant (E3), the Strep-tag II sequence with an Alanin-Serin-linker (Fig. 2) was fused to the C terminus of the HoxF protein. Then, two PCR products from the genomic DNA of Synechocystis PCC 6803 were amplified using primer pairs HoxF-out1/HoxF-in1 and HoxF-in2/HoxF-out2. The overlapping parts of the Strep-tag II sequence in these products could be fused together with a second PCR. Primer HoxF-in2 contained the restriction site for the enzyme BamHI, at this site the kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K was inserted as a selection marker in the same orientation as hox genes. To get a hyp gene expression construct, the respective operon of Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 was amplified by PCR using primers Anahyp1 and Anahyp2. The resulting 6.7-kb PCR product was cloned downstream of the psbAII promoter into Synechocystis expression vector pDH2. The latter vector was constructed by cutting the kanamycin cassette out of pDH1 with restriction enzymes XhoI and SacI, and ligating the chloramphenicol resistance cassette from pKS-CAT (HindIII and SacI digested) into the pDH1 vector in a half-blunt end ligation reaction. This construct was transformed into the Strep-tag II mutant E3. All constructs were sequenced before transformation in Synechocystis. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C under aerobic conditions. After washing and resuspending the pellet in buffer W (100 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) the cells were disrupted by three passages through a chilled French pressure cell (Sim Amicon) at 20,000 p.s.i. To obtain the soluble fraction the extract was centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 1 h. Subsequently, a concentrated ammonium sulfate solution was slowly added to a final concentration of 20%. After centrifuging for 30 min at 11,000 × g, the supernatant was applied to a 5-ml gravity flow Strep-Tactin-Sepharose column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). Unbound proteins were removed by washing 5 times with 1 column volume of buffer W. Recombinant protein was eluted by adding buffer E (buffer W with 2.5 mm desthiobiotin (IBA, Göttingen, Germany)) and the elution fraction was concentrated by centrifugation at 7,500 × g in centrifugal filters (Amicon Ultra 4, 10 K, Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). H2 production was measured with a Clark-type electrode (43.Wang R. Healey F.P. Myers J. Plant Physiol. 1971; 48: 108-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 5 mm methyl viologen and 10 mm sodium dithionite (10.Appel J. Phunpruch S. Steinmüller K. Schulz R. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Laboratories) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (44.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 16.5% Tricine-SDS gels (45.Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar), and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Porablot, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Proteins were detected with antibodies raised against Synechocystis HoxF (1:1000) and HoxH (1:100) (10.Appel J. Phunpruch S. Steinmüller K. Schulz R. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) or against the HypD (1:500) (46.Jones A.K. Lenz O. Strack A. Buhrke T. Friedrich B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13467-13477Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of R. eutropha and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Strep-tag II antibodies, obtained from IBA (Göttingen, Germany) were used as described by the manufacturer. As a protein marker, the prestained protein ladder PageRuler (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) was used. The excised gel slices were bleached, reduced with dithiothreitol, and acylated with jodacetamide. After digestion with trypsin, all mass spectra were acquired with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (ABI Voyager-STR). The measurements were carried out with an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. They were calibrated externally and internally using a standard Sequazyme Peptide Mass Standard kit and by the peptides generated by the autoproteolysis of trypsin. Protein identification by mass spectrometry data was achieved using the Protein Prospectors MS-Fit program (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and the Mascot search engine (version 2.0, Matrix Science Ltd.). Determination of the subunit stoichiometry was performed using a Procise 492 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The integrated peak areas of the separated 3-phenyl-2-thiohydantoin-derivatives during 13 Edman degradation cycles were used for quantification of the relative protein amounts. Protein samples were filled in X-Band EPR tubes (Rototec Spintec 707-SQ-250). For reductive activation catalytic amounts (5 mol % of protein) of NADH or NADPH were added and the samples were flushed with 100% H2 gas for 30 min in a glove box with an anaerobic atmosphere (5% H2, 95% N2). Sodium dithionite solution was prepared in an anoxic buffer, and the reduction was carried out under an argon atmosphere by adding a 20-fold excess to the sample. Furthermore, excess NADH was added to another sample that had been incubated with hydrogen and frozen after 30 min. In order to produce the highest oxidized state(s) in the enzyme, experiments with an excess of 2,6-dichloroindophenol were also carried out. Aliquots of the protein samples after various chemical treatments were taken for the FTIR spectroscopic investigations, whereas the main fraction was studied by EPR spectroscopy. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector at a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. The sample (0.1–0.6 mm protein) was held in a temperature-controlled (10 °C), gas-tight liquid cell (volume ∼7 μl, path length ≈50 μm) with CaF2 windows, whereas the sample chamber was purged with dried air. To follow the inactivation process after various chemical reactions, spectra were collected subsequently as a function of time while allowing air to penetrate slowly into the liquid cell. Subsequently, the FTIR spectra were baseline corrected by means of a spline function implemented within OPUS 4.2 software supplied by Bruker. The spectra shown in this work were normalized with respect to the integral intensity of the CO stretching bands. X-Band EPR measurements at 9.5 GHz were carried out on a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a rectangular microwave cavity working in the TE102 mode. The samples were placed in an Oxford ESR 900 helium-flow cryostat controlled with an Oxford ITC502 to allow measurements at temperatures between room temperature and 4 K. The microwave frequency was detected with an EIP frequency counter (Microwave Inc.). To obtain accurate g values the magnetic field was calibrated with an external standard (lithium particles embedded in LiF matrix) with a known g value of 2.002293 (47.Stesmans A. Van Gorp G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1989; 60: 2949-2952Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Simulations of the"

Amine-activated glycans were covalently printed on N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated glass slides and interrogated with different concentrations of recombinant CD-MPR or soluble CI-MPR. Neither receptor bound to non-phosphorylated glycans. The CD-MPR bound weakly or undetectably to the phosphodiester derivatives, but strongly to the phosphomonoester-containing glycans with the exception of a single Man7GlcNAc2-R isomer that contained a single Man-6-P residue. By contrast, the CI-MPR bound with high affinity to glycans containing either phospho-mono- or -diesters although, like the CD-MPR, it differentially recognized isomers of phosphorylated Man7GlcNAc2-R. This differential recognition of phosphorylated glycans by the CI- and CD-MPRs has implications for understanding the biosynthesis and targeting of lysosomal hydrolases."
https://openalex.org/W2071686660,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) has been identified to play important roles in neuronal death. Evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies indicates that increased GSK3beta activity contributes to neurodegeneration and to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. But the molecular mechanisms that underlie GSK3beta-mediated neurotoxicity remain poorly understood. We reported here that myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), a nuclear transcription factor known to promote neuronal survival, is directly phosphorylated by GSK3beta. Our data showed that phosphorylation of MEF2D by GSK3beta at three specific residues in its transactivation domain inhibits MEF2D transcriptional activity. Withdrawal of neuronal activity in cerebellar granule neurons activated GSK3beta in the nucleus, leading to GSK3beta-dependent inhibition of MEF2 function. This inhibition contributed to GSK3beta-mediated neuronal toxicity. Overexpression of MEF2D mutant that is resistant to GSK3beta inhibition protected cerebellar granule neurons from either GSK3beta activation- or neuronal activity deprivation-induced toxicity. These results identify survival factor MEF2D as a novel downstream effector targeted by GSK3beta and define a molecular link between activation of GSK3beta and neuronal survival machinery which may underlie in part GSK3beta-mediated neurotoxicity."

The Trypanosoma brucei Sir2 enzyme, TbSir2Rp1, is a particularly well characterized sirtuin with ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. TbSir2Rp1 has dual deacetylase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities on histone substrates (21.García-Salcedo J.A. Gijón P. Nolan D.P. Tebabi P. Pays E.

This suggested that substrates containing nucleophilic side chains at this position could potentially attack the O-alkylamidate intermediate and become ADP-ribosylated. To test this model, we performed a series of biochemical assays on the Thermotoga maritima sirtuin, Sir2Tm, and the mammalian sirtuin, SIRT1, using various peptides and found that these sirtuins ADP-ribosylate arginine at the +2 position in an acetylated peptide substrate. To gain further mechanistic insights, we solved a structure of Sir2Tm bound to the Arg-acetylated +2 peptide. The structural and biochemical data presented here describe a plausible mechanism for Sir2-mediated ADP-ribosylation of acetylated substrates.DISCUSSIONThe work presented here provides mechanistic insights into how acetylated substrates exhibit enhanced ADP-ribosylation by Sir2Tm. In several structures of either Sir2Tm or Sir2Af2 bound to an acetylated p53 peptide, the peptide methionine located two amino acids C-terminal to the acetyl lysine inserts into the enzyme active site just adjacent to the acetyl lysine (23.Hawse W.F.

Structure. 2006; 14: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Previously, Kowieski et al. (22.Kowieski T.M. Lee S. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5317-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) proposed that a nucleophilic side chain on an acetylated protein substrate could intercept a Sir2 deacetylation reaction intermediate. This proposal and previous Sir2-acetylated peptide structures led us to speculate that a nucleophilic amino acid substituted at the +2 position could react with the O-alkylamidate intermediate to yield an ADP-ribosylated product. Based on the dimensions and geometry of the Sir2Tm active site (26.Hoff K.G. Avalos J.L. Sens K. Wolberger C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the +2 amino acid from the substrate peptide needs to be longer than 5 Å to enter the active site, and ideally, longer than 6 Å. We found that substituting lysine or arginine at this key position of the acetylated p53 peptide indeed results in increased enzymatic ADP-ribosylation by Sir2Tm (Figs. 1, B and D, and 2). The acetyl p53 +2 Arg peptide also stimulates ADP-ribosylation activity of SIRT1 (Fig. 1E), suggesting that ADP-ribosylation activity is conserved in at least a subset of Sir2 enzymes. Peptides with arginine substitutions at positions other than two amino acids C-terminal to the acetyl lysine are far less efficiently ADP-ribosylated (Fig. 2), indicating that ADP-ribosylation by Sir2Tm is sensitive to the position of the substituted arginine. Acetyl lysine residues that are substrates for Sir2 enzymes are located in loop regions of proteins, so using peptide substrates is reasonable. However, it would be informative to analyze the Sir2 ribosylation activity on a protein substrate.The +2 Arg of the acetylated peptide was directly ADP-ribosylated by Sir2Tm. Based on the structure of Sir2Tm bound to the acetyl p53 +2 Arg peptide, the +2 Arg enters the Sir2Tm active site adjacent to the acetyl lysine binding tunnel. In this position, the +2 arginine could react with a Sir2 deacetylation reaction intermediate to become ADP-ribosylated. Our biochemical and structural data support a mechanism in which the +2 arginine reacts with the O-alkylamidate intermediate generating ADP-ribosylated arginine, nicotinamide, and acetyl lysine (Fig. 6, step I). Next, the +2 arginine would react with the O-alkylamidate to generate ADP-ribosylated arginine, nicotinamide, and acetyl lysine (Fig. 6, step II).FIGURE 6Structure-based mechanism of acetyl-dependent Sir2Tm-mediated ribosylation. In the first step of the reaction (step I), the acetyl lysine reacts with NAD+ to generate the O-alkylamidate. The O-alkylamidate can react with nicotinamide to regenerate the starting reactants, NAD+ and acetyl lysine, react with the 2′OH from the nicotinamide-ribose, leading to deacetylation products, or react with the arginine, resulting in ribosylation of the peptide substrate (step II).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An N-terminal lysine is also ADP-ribosylated in the acetylated +2 Arg peptide, suggesting an alternate pathway for ADP-ribosylating substrates (Fig. 3). In structures of Sir2Tm bound to the acetylated p53 peptide, this N-terminal lysine cannot access the Sir2Tm active site. The N-terminal lysine is disordered in all of the Sir2Tm-acetyl p53 peptide complex structures and extends out into solvent. There are at least three models that could explain the ADP-ribosylation of this lysine. First, the reaction product O-acetyl ADP-ribose or NAD+ could react with this lysine nonenzymatically to yield a ribosylated product. There are three additional lysines in the acetyl p53 peptide that are not ribosylated (Fig. 2), arguing that this nonenzymatic mechanism is not likely. A second model would involve binding of a first acetyl peptide and formation of the O-alkylamidate intermediate. Next, another peptide could bind to Sir2Tm and insert the N-terminal lysine into the active site to react with the O-alkylamidate intermediate or another deacetylation intermediate. Based on all identified entry tunnels to the Sir2 active site, the lysine from the second peptide would not be long enough to gain access to the active site, suggesting that this mechanism is not likely. A third model involves Sir2Tm binding the N-terminal lysine through the acetyl lysine binding tunnel instead of the acetyl lysine. A crystal structure of Sir2Tm bound to an unacetylated p53 peptide demonstrates that Sir2Tm can bind unacetylated lysine peptides within the acetyl lysine binding tunnel (24.Cosgrove M.S. Bever K. Avalos J.L. Muhammad S. Zhang X. Wolberger C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7511-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The unacetylated lysine can insert into the active site and come within 4.5 Å of the C1′ of NAD+ (Fig. 7). Next, the lysine could then directly attack the C1′ of NAD+ to yield a ribosylated lysine and nicotinamide. Further studies will be required to assess this proposed mechanism and determine whether other post-translational modifications including propionyl-lysine, which is a substrate for Sir2Tm-mediated depropionylation(33.Garrity J.

Although it is not known whether ADP-ribosylation of glutamate dehydrogenase is dependent upon prior acetylation of that enzyme, it was recently found that glutamate dehydrogenase is acetylated at multiple sites (34.Choudhary C.

https://openalex.org/W2016231318,"Enzymes scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important for cell protection during stress and aging. A deficiency in these enzymes leads to ROS imbalance, causing various disorders in many organisms, including yeast. In contrast to liquid cultures, where fitness of the yeast population depends on its ROS scavenging capability, the present study suggests that Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells growing in colonies capable of ammonia signaling use a broader protective strategy. Instead of maintaining high levels of antioxidant enzymes for ROS detoxification, colonies activate an alternative metabolism that prevents ROS production. Colonies of the strain deficient in cytosolic superoxide dismutase Sod1p thus developed the same way as wild type colonies. They produced comparable levels of ammonia and underwent similar developmental changes (expression of genes of alternative metabolism and center margin differentiation in ROS production, cell death occurrence, and activities of stress defense enzymes) and did not accumulate stress-resistant suppressants. An absence of cytosolic catalase Ctt1p, however, brought colonies developmental problems, which were even more prominent in the absence of mitochondrial Sod2p. sod2Δ and ctt1Δ colonies failed in ammonia production and sufficient activation of the alternative metabolism and were incapable of center margin differentiation, but they did not increase ROS levels. These new data indicate that colony disorders are not accompanied by ROS burst but could be a consequence of metabolic defects, which, however, could be elicited by imbalance in ROS produced in early developmental phases. Sod2p and homeostasis of ROS may participate in regulatory events leading to ammonia signaling. Enzymes scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important for cell protection during stress and aging. A deficiency in these enzymes leads to ROS imbalance, causing various disorders in many organisms, including yeast. In contrast to liquid cultures, where fitness of the yeast population depends on its ROS scavenging capability, the present study suggests that Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells growing in colonies capable of ammonia signaling use a broader protective strategy. Instead of maintaining high levels of antioxidant enzymes for ROS detoxification, colonies activate an alternative metabolism that prevents ROS production. Colonies of the strain deficient in cytosolic superoxide dismutase Sod1p thus developed the same way as wild type colonies.

When organisms, including yeast, grow under aerobic conditions, they produce ROS 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesDHEdihydroethidiumGSglutamine synthetaseMet+methionine prototrophyPQrParaquat-resistantwtwild typeMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. as a consequence of aerobic respiration. Their excess is scavenged by different stress defense enzymes. Various clinical human disorders such as porphyria, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and some neurodegenerative diseases are believed to be partly induced by unbalanced ROS levels or by a deficiency in one of the stress defense enzymes (1.Eberhardt M.K.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can protect itself against various stresses (including oxidative stress) with a variety of ROS-scavenging enzymes, including superoxide dismutases, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins, and others. As do other eukaryotes, S. cerevisiae contains cytosolic CuZn-Sod1p and mitochondrial Mn-Sod2p superoxide dismutases responsible for the removal of superoxide radicals. Another S. cerevisiae enzyme that plays a role in ROS detoxification and yeast resistance to various stresses (2.Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3.Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and that appears to be important for replicative life span (4.Van Zandycke S.M. Sohier P.J. Smart K.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and programmed cell death (5.Guaragnella N. Antonacci L. Giannattasio S. Marra E. Passarella S. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is the cytosolic catalase Ctt1p, which decomposes hydrogen peroxide. Mutants deficient in mitochondrial Sod2p are sensitive to hyperoxia and exhibit growth inhibition on respiratory carbon sources, but during aerobic growth on glucose the absence of this enzyme has little effect (6.Westerbeek-Marres C.A. Moore M.M. Autor A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The loss of Sod1p leads to more pleiotropic defects, including sensitivity to various exogenous stresses and reduced growth under all aerobic conditions because of oxidative injury by internal oxygen species (7.Davidson J.F.

A consequence of endogenous oxidative stress is damage of particular biosynthetic enzymes, resulting in lysine and methionine auxotrophy (10.Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A.

Defective phenotypes associated with sod1Δ strains are usually suppressed by the accumulation of stress-resistant mutants of the two main groups. The first group includes mutations in the BSD1 and BSD2 genes involved in Mn2+ homeostasis (11.Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sod1Δbsd mutants increase the cytosolic concentration of Mn2+, which possesses some intrinsic superoxide dismutase activity and partially compensates for the absence of Sod1p. The second group, designated seo (for suppressors of endogenous oxygen toxicity), includes various mutations that restore Met and Lys prototrophy, although sensitivity to environmental oxidants (e.g. Paraquat) is not reverted (10.Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast to liquid microbial cultures commonly studied in laboratories, microorganisms in their natural environments often organize as multicellular communities (e.g. colonies and biofilms) with unique properties (12.Nadell C.D. Xavier J.B. Foster K.R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2009; 33: 206-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 13.Palková Z. Váchová L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 806-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). During long term development, colonies of different yeasts can undergo developmental changes characterized by extracellular alkalization and production of volatile ammonia, which functions as a signaling molecule (14.Palková Z. Janderová B. Gabriel J. Zikánová B. Pospísek M. Forstová J. Nature. 1997; 390: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae colonies, ammonia elicits expression changes leading to metabolic reprogramming (e.g. activation of peroxisomes and fatty acid β-oxidation, the methyl glyoxylate cycle, amino acid metabolism, and the production of different plasma membrane transporters) and a parallel decrease in the expression of stress-related genes (including CTT1 and SOD1) and genes of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (15.Palková Z. Devaux F. Ricicova M. Mináriková L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ammonia signaling is also important for constraining apoptotic-like cells to the colony center (16.Váchová L. Palková Z. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This study assesses the importance of the individual stress defense enzymes (a deficiency of which poses a serious problem for liquid yeast cultures) during the development of S. cerevisiae colonies. New data suggest that in colonies activation of the ammonia-induced adaptive metabolism is more important for proper development and survival than the presence of ROS scavenging enzymatic activities. Nevertheless, ROS homeostasis appears to be important for the induction of ammonia signaling and activation of metabolic changes. S. cerevisiae strain BY4742 (MATα, his3Δ, leu2Δ, lys2Δ, ura3Δ) and all isogenic mutants (sod1Δ, sod2Δ, ctt1Δ) were obtained from the EUROSCARF collection. Yeast giant colonies (14.Palková Z. Janderová B. Gabriel J. Zikánová B. Pospísek M. Forstová J. Nature. 1997; 390: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) were grown 6/plate at 28 °C on GMA (1% yeast extract, 3% glycerol, 2% agar, 30 mm CaCl2) or on GMA-bromcresol purple (GMA, 0.01% bromcresol purple). Liquid yeast cultures were grown at 28 °C in a shaker in either YPD (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 1% pepton), GM (GMA without agar), or SD (2% glucose, 100 mm KH2PO4, 15 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.15% Wickerham's yeast nitrogen base supplemented with 150 mg/liter of histidine, leucine, lysine, and methionine and 60 mg/liter of uracil), buffered with 50 mm potassium Pi (KH2PO4/K2HPO4), pH 6.5, when appropriate. Agar media (YPDA and SDA) were solidified with 2% agar. Gene, protein, and mutant strain symbols follow standard yeast terminology. Ammonia released by growing colonies was absorbed into acidic traps (14.Palková Z. Janderová B. Gabriel J. Zikánová B. Pospísek M. Forstová J. Nature. 1997; 390: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The amount of ammonia was determined using Nessler's reagent. The methods used were described previously (17.Váchová L. Devaux F. Kucerová H. Ricicová M. Jacq C. Palková Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37973-37981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, cells from the central and margin regions of 6–12 colonies were broken in 10 mm MES buffer, pH 6, with Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) with glass beads in a FastPrep instrument (QBiogene). After cell debris removal, the supernatant (5–15 μg of proteins/slot determined using a Bio-Rad protein detection kit) was subjected to PAGE under nondenaturing conditions. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity in the gels was determined (18.Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9904) Google Scholar, 19.Clare D.A. Duong M.N. Darr D. Archibald F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were quantified by image analyses using UltraQuant 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics). Total RNA from ∼100 mg of wet colony biomass was extracted by a hot phenol method (15.Palková Z. Devaux F. Ricicova M. Mináriková L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For northern blots, 15 μg of total RNA was separated in 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The Northern blots were densitometrically quantified using UltraQuant 6.0 software. The values presented are relative densities calculated for the maximal value of each film (set as 100%). RDN18 was the nonregulated control gene. Survival of cells from colonies was analyzed in liquid SD, YPD, or GM (inoculated to A560 = 0.2). The number of living cells was determined after 1–7 days of cultivation by drop assay. Five-microliter drops of serial 10-fold dilutions of the cell cultures were spotted on an YPDA, and the number of colony-forming cells was determined after 3 days of cultivation. The appearance of suppressor mutants in sod1Δ cultures was determined by drop assay on SDA without methionine and on YPDA supplemented with 1.5 mm Paraquat (methyl viologen; MP Biomedicals) or 5 mm MnSO4. Harvested colonies were suspended in distilled water to a concentration of 7.5 mg/ml. 10-fold serial dilutions of these suspensions were incubated at 52 °C for 150 min in microtitre plates, and then 5 μl drops were spotted on YPDA. The number of colony-forming cells was determined after 3 days of cultivation. Control cells were spotted at the same dilutions before the heat treatment. For 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of the DNA, the cells were permeabilized with 60% ethanol. 4′,6′-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was added to a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, and the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope using an A filter (Leica). Nuclear morphology was determined from a minimum of 500 cells/sample. Cell morphology and the presence of shrunken cells were visualized with Nomarski contrast (supplemental Fig. S3A). For DHE staining, 50 μl of 15 mg/ml cell suspension in 25 mm MES, pH 6, was incubated with 5 μl of 25 μg/ml DHE (Sigma; 1 mg/ml stock solution in Me2SO) for 25 min. The suspension was then transferred to a cuvette with 1.95 ml of distilled water. Mitochondrial superoxide production was monitored by MitoSOX Red staining. Twenty-five μl of 0.5 mm MitoSOX (Molecular Probes; 5 mm stock solution in Me2SO) was added to a cuvette with 2 ml of cell suspension (containing 0.75 mg of wet biomass) and incubated for 5 min. The release of hydrogen peroxide from cells was measured with an Amplex Red horseradish peroxidase kit (Molecular Probes). Fifty μl of cell suspension (15 mg/ml in 25 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0) incubated for 30 min in the presence of 50 μm Amplex Red, and 5 units/ml of horseradish peroxidase was diluted with 1.95 ml of distilled water. Fluorescence was measured using a FluoroMax 3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon) with the following excitation/emission wavelengths: 480/604 nm for DHE, 510/580 nm for MitoSOX Red, and 525/585 nm for Amplex Red. Readings from unstained cells were used as an autofluorescence control and subtracted from the stained cell fluorescence. The enzymatic activities of glutathione peroxidase and peroxiredoxins were measured in cell extracts prepared as described above, with the exception of using 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.8, for the extraction. The samples of 100 μg of protein were assayed with a glutathione peroxidase cellular activity assay kit (Sigma) detecting changes in NADPH absorbance after the addition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Peroxiredoxin activity was assayed by glutamine synthetase (GS) protection assay (20.Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Netto L.E. Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which is based on the sensitivity of GS to oxidative damage caused by a thiol/Fe3+/O2 mixed function oxidase system. The ability of a cell extract to protect GS from oxidative damage is mostly ascribed to the activity of peroxiredoxins (21.Netto L.E. Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the assay, 1 unit of glutamine synthetase (Sigma) in 50 μl was incubated with a mixture of 3 μm FeCl3 and 10 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of the cell extract (containing 50 μg of protein). After 10 min, the remaining GS activity was determined by adding 950 μl of a GS activity assay mixture (0.4 mm ADP, 150 mm glutamine, 10 mm KH2AsO4, 20 mm NH2OH, 0.4 mm MnCl2, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After 15 min, the reaction was stopped with 200 μl of a mixture of 5.5% FeCl3, 2% trichloroacetic acid, and 2% HCl. The γ-glutamylhydroxamate-Fe3+ complex was determined at 420 nm. The intrinsic GS activity of the cell extract was subtracted. The activity of GS prior to treatment with FeCl3/dithiothreitol was taken as 100%. Without the protection by cell extract, the GS completely lost its activity. The data points representing the means ± S.D. were calculated from at least four independent experiments. Where appropriate, data significance was determined using the two-tailed t test. p values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 or commented in the figure legends. The growth of colonies of strains deficient in Sod1p, Sod2p, or cytosolic Ctt1p on GMA was comparable with the growth of wild type (wt) BY4742 colonies (supplemental Fig. S1), exhibiting a linear increase in cell biomass that is typical for yeast colonies growing on solid media (16.Váchová L. Palková Z. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22.Palková Z. Váchová L. Gásková D. Kucerová H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2009; 26: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The colony development, however, substantially differed among strains, some being impaired in ammonia signaling. Whereas sod1Δ colonies exhibited a morphology, alkalization, and ammonia production comparable with the wt phenotype, sod2Δ colonies displayed altered morphology and failed to produce ammonia and accomplish transition to the alkali phase (Fig. 1, A and B). ctt1Δ colonies produced a reduced level of ammonia. To find out whether sod1Δ, sod2Δ, and ctt1Δ colonies are able to activate adaptive metabolic changes ascribed to ammonia signaling (15.Palková Z. Devaux F. Ricicova M. Mináriková L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we monitored expression of the most relevant genes involved in these changes. Expression of carbon metabolism and transporter genes (CIT3, POX1, ATO1, ATO3, and JEN1) was activated in ammonia-producing sod1Δ colonies as well as in wt colonies. The expression of these genes reached significantly lower levels in sod2Δ colonies and was slightly diminished in ctt1Δ colonies (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S2A). On the other hand, sod2Δ colonies maintained a partially higher level of stress-related gene expression (MSN4, HSP30, and CTT1), contrary to sod1Δ and wt colonies (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S2B). These data showed that colonies of all three mutants initiated adaptive metabolic changes in approximately the same developmental period as did wt strain colonies, but in sod2Δ (and to some extent also in ctt1Δ) colonies the changes did not reach a level comparable with that of the wt and sod1Δ colonies. Because sok2Δ colonies lacking Sok2p transcription factor and defective in ammonia signaling also exhibit an altered distribution of dying apoptotic-like cells (16.Váchová L. Palková Z. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we examined center margin colony differentiation in sod1Δ, sod2Δ, and ctt1Δ colonies. First, we analyzed the occurrence of cells exhibiting late dying features (chromatin condensation and fragmentation as well as the presence of “shrunken,” i.e. partially digested, cells) (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S3A) in outer margin and central colony areas. As in wt colonies, the cells exhibiting modified nuclei and shrunken cells were preferentially localized to central regions in ammonia-producing sod1Δ colonies, whereas cells located at the margin were mostly normal and healthy. In contrast, the cells with both dying features were spread throughout the whole of sod2Δ and ctt1Δ colonies (impaired in ammonia production) (Fig. 2A) similarly as in sok2Δ colonies (16.Váchová L. Palková Z. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we determined stress-related characteristics of cells harvested from the central and margin regions of colonies from each strain. We determined ROS levels, ROS-scavenging enzyme activity, and cell tolerance to heat shock (Fig. 2, B–F). Cellular ROS production is characteristic of oxidative stress and has also been linked to ongoing apoptosis (23.Perrone G.G. Tan S.X. Dawes I.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1354-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The occurrence of the superoxide was detected as superoxide-mediated oxidation of either DHE (detecting total cellular superoxide) or MitoSOX Red, an indicator of mitochondrial superoxide. After entering the alkali phase (at day 11), central and outer cells in colonies of both ammonia-producing strains (wt and sod1Δ) exhibited divergent trends in both mitochondrial and cellular superoxide levels. Whereas superoxide concentration gradually increased in the colony center, we observed a simultaneous decrease in the colony margin. A significantly smaller center margin difference was observed in ammonia production-impaired sod2Δ and ctt1Δ colonies. Interestingly, however, despite the similar profiles in central and outer cells, relative levels of mitochondrial (Fig. 2C) and cellular (Fig. 2B) superoxide differed. Total cellular superoxide levels in central cells of sod2Δ and ctt1Δ colonies did not increase as in wt central cells, whereas outer cell levels were comparable with wt (Fig. 2B). Conversely, mitochondrial superoxide levels in outer cells of sod2Δ and ctt1Δ did not decrease as in their wt counterparts, whereas central cell levels remained equivalent (Fig. 2C). These data showed that the overall superoxide level did not increase in sod1Δ, sod2Δ, and ctt1Δ colonies in general, although homeostasis of mitochondrial and cellular superoxide was differentially misbalanced. Cell production of hydrogen peroxide was determined through the Amplex Red assay (supplemental Fig. S4). The results confirmed that center margin H2O2 differences were nearly 40% more pronounced in wt and sod1Δ colonies as compared with sod2Δ and ctt1Δ colonies. However, the center margin difference in ammonia-producing colonies as compared with colonies defective in ammonia production was less prominent than in the case of the superoxide. This could be caused by more efficient diffusion of H2O2 across a colony. Overall amounts of H2O2 released by colonial cells were just 6–17% of the amounts released by 24-h-old wt cells cultivated in YPD liquid medium (data not shown). Because the cellular ROS homeostasis is determined by both ROS production and ROS-scavenging enzymes, we examined catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in colonies. Within wt and sod1Δ colonies, Ctt1p activity was significantly higher in central than in outer cells, whereas it remained uniform within sod2Δ colonies (Fig. 2D). Similarly, Sod1p activity was significantly higher in central than outer wt cells but homogeneous among both sod2Δ colony regions (Fig. 2E). Sod1p activity transiently increased in the central region of ctt1Δ colonies during their transition to the abortive alkali phase (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, both enzyme activities of central sod2Δ cells were lower than those of central wt cells. Variations in scavenging enzymatic activities can influence cell sensitivity to different stresses inducing ROS production. It was shown, for example, that sod1Δ is more sensitive to heat shock, presumably because of increased ROS production at elevated temperature (7.Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Heat shock tolerance of central and outer cells from both wt and sod1Δ colonies differed significantly (Fig. 2F). The survival rate of central cells was 10 times higher than that of outer cells from alkali phase and second acidic phase colonies after exposure to 52 °C for 150 min. Despite the similar trend, both central and outer cells from sod1Δ colonies were ∼5–10 times more sensitive to the heat shock than wt cells. In contrast, there was no difference in heat shock sensitivity between central and outer cells from sod2Δ and ctt1Δ colonies (Fig. 2F). Surprisingly, cells from sod2Δ and ctt1Δ colonies were in general relatively resistant. The above data show that the distribution of cells harboring dying and stress-related characteristics differed in the central and margin regions of ammonia-producing sod1Δ and wt colonies. In contrast, there was little or even no difference in their distribution in sod2Δ and ctt1Δ colonies, which are incapable of ammonia signaling. In addition, contrary to liquid cultures, there was no increase in ROS and/or ROS-scavenging enzymes in colonies deficient in these enzymes. In fact, levels of ROS and of scavenging enzymes were even decreased in some cases. To determine whether the activation of some other stress defense mechanisms could be responsible for compensating the lack of superoxide dismutases or catalase, we measured glutathione peroxidase and peroxiredoxin activities. As shown in supplemental Fig. S5, these activities in cells harvested from 23- and 30-day-old colonies were approximately the same among all strains. Surprisingly, in contrast to the absence of mitochondrial Sod2p, the absence of cytosolic Sod1p was accompanied by no visible defect in colony development and long term survival, despite the fact that sod1Δ colonies were grown aerobically on respiratory glycerol medium GMA. In sharp contrast, it has been shown previously that the absence of Sod1p leads to pleiotropic defects in liquid yeast cultures (e.g. increased sensitivity to oxygen and various stresses, slow growth, and rapid cell dying) (7.Davidson J.F.

To determine whether the wt-like behavior of GMA-grown sod1Δ colonies could be caused by the high accumulation rate of stress-resistant suppressor mutants, we tested the sensitivity of cells harvested from sod1Δ colonies to the superoxide-producing agent Paraquat (an extracellular stressor). We also monitored whether these cells still exhibit Met auxotrophy (a result of intracellular oxygen stress (10.Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar)) under aerobic conditions. As shown in Fig. 3A, even sod1Δ cells from 30-day-old GMA-grown colonies (GMA-sod1Δ) still exhibited high sensitivity to Paraquat and Met auxotrophy at normoxic O2. They were not hypersensitive to extracellular Mn2+. In contrast, a 10-day-old sod1Δ colony grown on YPDA glucose agar (YPDA-sod1Δ) contained ∼1% Paraquat-resistant cells (PQr) and 5% methionine prototrophic (Met+) cells (0.1% of Met+ cells was observed even in a fresh 2-day-old YPDA-sod1Δ colony). These data demonstrate that sod1Δ cells from aged GMA-grown colonies exhibited neither of the characteristics typical of either of the two previously described groups of suppressor mutations (bsd and seo) (10.Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

The data described above excluded the accumulation of oxidative stress-resistant mutants in GMA-grown sod1Δ colonies. An interesting possibility remained, however, that cells within these colonies either transiently adapt or acquire mutation(s), resulting in properties optimal for their existence within this multicellular structure. To investigate this possibility, we compared sod1Δ cells forming colonies capable of ammonia signaling with sod1Δ cells forming colonies under"
https://openalex.org/W1974326753,"Mutations in the activation peptide of human cationic trypsinogen have been found in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Previous biochemical studies demonstrated that mutations p.D19A, p.D22G, and p.K23R strongly stimulate trypsinogen autoactivation. In the present study, we characterized the cell biological effects of these mutants using human embryonic kidney 293T and AR42J rat acinar cells. We found that relative to wild-type trypsinogen, secretion of the mutants from transfected cells was markedly decreased. This apparent secretion defect was completely rescued by inhibition of autoactivation via (1) inclusion of the small molecule trypsin inhibitor benzamidine in the growth medium; or (2) cotransfection with the physiological trypsin inhibitor SPINK1; or (3) by mutation of the catalytic Ser(200) residue in trypsinogen. In contrast, extracellularly added SPINK1 or other nonpermeable proteinaceous trypsin inhibitors did not restore normal secretion of the mutants, indicating that intracellular autoactivation is responsible for the observed secretion loss. Acinar cells expressing the p.D22G mutant detached from the culture plate over time, became terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive, and exhibited elevated levels of the proapoptotic transcription factor CHOP. The observations indicate that activation peptide mutants of human cationic trypsinogen undergo autoactivation intracellularly, which leads to decreased trypsinogen secretion and eventual acinar cell death. The results thus define a novel pathological pathway for parenchymal injury in hereditary chronic pancreatitis."

Homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays were developed to characterize HIV-1 integrase dimerization and the interaction between LEDGF and IN dimers. Using these assays in an equilibrium end point dose-response format with mathematical modeling, we determined the dissociation constants of IN dimers (Kdimer = 67.8 pm) and of LEDGF from IN dimers (Kd = 10.9 nm). When used in a kinetic format, the assays allowed the determination of the on- and off-rate constants for these same interactions. Integrase dimerization had a kon of 0.1247 nm−1·min−1 and a koff of 0.0080 min−1 resulting in a Kdimer of 64.5 pm. LEDGF binding to IN dimers had a kon of 0.0285 nm−1·min−1 and a koff of 0.2340 min−1 resulting in a Kd of 8.2 nm. These binding assays can also be used in an equilibrium end point competition format. In this format, the IN catalytic core domain produced a Ki of 15.2 nm while competing for integrase dimerization, confirming the very tight interaction of IN with itself. In the same format, LEDGF produced a Ki value of 35 nm when competing for LEDGF binding to IN dimers. In summary, this study describes a methodology combining homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer and mathematical modeling to derive the affinities between IN monomers and between LEDGF and IN dimers.

One integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), raltegravir (MK-0518), has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of HIV-1 infection, and a second drug, elvitegravir (GS-9137), is in late stage clinical development. Based on binding experiments (1.Espeseth A.S. Felock P. Wolfe A. Witmer M. Grobler J. Anthony N. Egbertson M. Melamed J.Y. Young S. Hamill T. Cole J.L. Hazuda D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

INSTIs thus prevent the integrase-viral DNA complex from engaging host target DNA. More recently, a second site on integrase that represents the binding site for the cellular cofactor LEDGF was demonstrated to be a viable and attractive target for antiviral drug discovery (3.Al-Mawsawi L.Q.

A small molecule inhibitor targeting this second site may retain activity against viral mutants resistant to INSTIs and complement the antiviral activity of INSTIs, akin to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Hence, compounds that interact with the LEDGF binding pocket on IN could be used in combination with INSTIs to decrease the likelihood of resistance emergence. human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 lens epithelium-derived growth factor integrase homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer catalytic core domain one integrase strand transfer inhibitor integrase binding domain 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol recombinant tobacco etch virus 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid dithiothreitol 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid N-terminal domain tetraphenylarsonium chloride.

LEDGF interacts with integrase primarily through an ∼80-amino acid domain termed the integrase binding domain (IBD) (11.Cherepanov P. Devroe E. Silver P.A. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48883-48892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A solution structure of the IBD has been derived (12.Cherepanov P. Sun Z.Y. Rahman S. Maertens G.

In addition, several co-crystal structures involving IBD and IN domains have been solved and include the following: IBD bound to a dimer of HIV-1 integrase catalytic core domain (CCD), IBD bound to an HIV-2 two-domain integrase (N-terminal domain (NTD) and catalytic core domain), and IBD bound to a maedi-visna virus two-domain (NTD + CCD) integrase (13.Cherepanov P.

Several lines of evidence point to the requirement of LEDGF for HIV-1 replication as a viral cofactor as follows. 1) Mutations in integrase that preserve the catalytic activity of the enzyme but cause defects in viral replication also disrupt integrase interaction with LEDGF (16.Lu R.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1767-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). 4) Overexpression of the IBD in target cells inhibits HIV replication through a dominant negative mechanism (23.De Rijck J. Vandekerckhove L. Gijsbers R. Hombrouck A. Hendrix J. Vercammen J. Engelborghs Y. Christ F. Debyser Z. J.

PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3 (418–430): e47Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Together, these lines of evidence validate the disruption of the integrase-LEDGF interaction as a strategy with therapeutic potential. Despite an abundance of structural information about the interaction of integrase with the IBD of LEDGF, precise determination of the equilibrium and kinetic binding constants between integrase monomers and between integrase and LEDGF is lacking. To characterize these interactions in detail, we developed a novel methodology that combines homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays and mathematical modeling. This methodology enabled the precise determination, for the first time, of the equilibrium constants and kinetic constants of integrase dimer formation and integrase-LEDGF association. These assays can also be used in an equilibrium end point competition binding format to study inhibitors of integrase dimerization or of integrase-LEDGF interaction. All the peptides used in this study were custom-synthesized and purified to >90% purity using the services of Anaspec Inc. (San Jose, CA). Isolation of the LEDGF cDNA and the construction of pLEDGF-6His, a plasmid expressing a C-terminally His6-tagged LEDGF protein, have been described previously (25.Yu F. Jones G.S. Hung M. Wagner A.H. MacArthur H.L. Liu X. Leavitt S. McDermott M.J. Tsiang M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All subsequent LEDGF variants were created using pLEDGF-6His as the starting plasmid. Plasmid pLEDGF, containing native LEDGF, was constructed by substituting a C-terminal 472-bp fragment of pLEDGF-6His with the corresponding fragment lacking the His6 tag. The two PCR amplification primers used for this construction were as follows: Stu5p-LEDGF1126, 5′-CATTGAGGCCTTGGATG-3′, and Hind3p-LEDGF1593, 5′-TTTAAGCTTTTAGTTATCTAGTGTAGAATCC-3′. Plasmid pLEDGF-FLAG containing a C-terminally FLAG-tagged LEDGF was constructed by substituting the same 472-bp fragment of pLEDGF-6His with one containing a FLAG epitope using the two PCR amplification primers as follows: Stu5p-LEDGF1126, 5′-CATTGAGGCCTTGGATG-3′, and Hind3pCFLAG LEDGF, 5′-AAGCTTTATTTGTCATCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGCTGCCGTTATCTAGTGTAGAATCCTTC-3′. After PCR amplification, the amplification products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (catalogue number 28104, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and digested with StuI and HindIII. The double-digested PCR products were purified on a 1% agarose gel and subcloned into pLEDGF75–6His in which the StuI and HindIII cut fragment has been removed. The construct was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (catalogue number C6000-03, Invitrogen) for protein expression. Plasmid pMAL-IBD-(347–471)-WT contains the maltose-binding protein fused to the N terminus of the wild-type LEDGF integrase binding domain IBD-(347–471). The DNA segment corresponding to IBD-(347–471) was amplified by PCR using pLEDGF-6His as template and subcloned into the NcoI- and HindIII-cloning sites of the pMAL vector (catalogue number E8200S, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) that encodes an rTEV protease recognition site at the C terminus of MBP. The two PCR primers are as follows: NcoIBD5p, 5′-CCATGGGCTCAATGGATTCTCGAC-3′, and Hind3-IBD3p, 5′-AAGCTTTTATTCCTTCTCTAGCTTTTTG-3′. Plasmid pMAL-IBD-(347–471)-2Mut, containing MBP-IBD-(347–471) with the double mutation I365A/D366N, was made by site-directed mutagenesis of pMAL-IBD-(347–471)-WT using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (catalogue number 200519, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequences of the plus and minus strand mutagenic primers are as follows: IBD I365A/D366Nplus, 5′-GATTAAAAATTCACTCAAAGCTAATAATCTTGATGTGAAC-3′, and IBDI365A/D366Nminus, 5′-GTTCACATCAAGATTATTAGCTTTGAGTGAATTTTTAATC-3′. The N-terminally His6-tagged integrase (6His-IN) has been described previously (2.Chen X. Tsiang M. Yu F. Hung M. Jones G.S. Zeynalzadegan A. Qi X. Jin H. Kim C.U. Swaminathan S. Chen J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 504-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For C-terminally FLAG-tagged IN (IN-FLAG) expression, the sequence of wild-type IN was cloned as an N-terminal His8-tagged and C-terminal FLAG-tagged protein. The N-terminal His8 tag serves as an affinity purification handle that was subsequently cleaved off by rTEV protease to generate IN-FLAG. The cloning primers are as follows: NdeI5pIN, 5′-GGCCATATGTTTTTAGATGGAATAG-3′, and HindIII3pFLAGIN, 5′-AAGCTTTATTTGTCATCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGCTGCCATCCTCATCCTGTCTACTTGC-3′. The integrase sequence was amplified from pET3a-6HisIN as described previously (2.Chen X. Tsiang M. Yu F. Hung M. Jones G.S. Zeynalzadegan A. Qi X. Jin H. Kim C.U. Swaminathan S. Chen J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 504-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After amplification, the amplification products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (catalogue number 28104, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and digested with NdeI and HindIII. The NdeI and HindIII cut inserts were purified on a 1% agarose gel and cloned into the NdeI and HindIII sites of the modified pET28a vector that encodes two more histidine residue and an rTEV recognition site (catalogue number V351-20, Invitrogen). The construct is named p8His-Tev-IN-FLAG. The construct was introduced into BL21(DE3) One Shot cells (catalogue number C6000-03, Invitrogen) for protein expression. The integrase catalytic core domain (INCCD), residues 50–212 of IN, with a single solubility mutation (F185K) was cloned as an N-terminally His6-tagged protein in the plasmid p6His-INCCD(F185K). For production of untagged INCCD, the INCCD was cloned downstream of a thrombin cleavage site preceded by a His6 tag in pET28a to generate the construct p6His-IIa-INCCD(F185K). The cloning primers for this construct are as follows: NdeINCore5p, 5′-TTTCATATGCATGGACAAGTAGACTG-3′, and H3INCore3p, 5′-TTTAAGCTTTTATTCTTTAGTTTGTATG-3′. After PCR amplification using p6His-INCCD(F185K) as template, the amplification product was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (catalogue number 28104, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and digested with NdeI and HindIII. The double-digested product was purified on a 1% agarose gel and subcloned into the NdeI and HindIII sites of the pET28a (catalogue number 69864, EMD BioSciences, La Jolla, CA). Both constructs were introduced into E. coli BL21-(DE3) (catalogue number 70235-3, EMD BioSciences) for protein expression. BL21(DE3) E. coli transformed with the various expression constructs were grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. These overnight cultures were used to inoculate 6 liters of L-broth containing ampicillin (kanamycin for p8His-Tev-IN-FLAG) at an initial density of 0.05 A600/ml. The cultures were grown at 37 °C and 250 rpm until they reached a density of A600 = 0.8–1.0, which took ∼3–4 h. Protein expression was then induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cultures were kept at 30 °C and 250 rpm for an additional 3 h before the cells were pelleted and stored at −80 °C. Sixteen grams of cell pellet were lysed in 200 ml of Lysis Buffer by passing three times through a microfluidizer. Lysis Buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.0) was used for LEDGF, Lysis Buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for MBP-IBD, Lysis Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for INCCD, and Lysis Buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 8His-Tev-IN-FLAG. The homogenate was centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. For most proteins, supernatant (S1) was saved for protein purification using a three-column method. The supernatant (S1) derived from the centrifugation of cell homogenates (see above) was loaded at 5 ml/min to an XK 26 × 20 column (catalogue number 17-0510-10, GE Healthcare) containing 20 ml of Q-Sepharose-HP that was pre-equilibrated in Buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) to eliminate nonspecific bacterial protein. The flow-through from the Q-Sepharose-HP column was loaded directly onto a 5-ml heparin column. Nonspecific proteins were washed away with 8–10 column volumes of Buffer A at 5 ml/min. LEDGF or LEDGF-FLAG were next eluted with a 100-ml NaCl gradient (0–1000 mm) with a slope of 10 mm/ml. Three milliliter fractions were collected during the elution. The protein peak fractions were analyzed on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel (catalogue number NP0322BOX, Invitrogen) in MES buffer. Fractions containing the ∼60.0- or 61.2-kDa LEDGF or LEDGF-FLAG band were pooled, diluted 15-fold with Buffer A to ∼10 mm NaCl, adjusted to pH 7.0, and filtered to remove any precipitate. The diluted and filtered sample was loaded at 5 ml/min onto a 5-ml cation exchange HiTrap SP-HP column (catalogue number 17-1152-01, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was then washed with Buffer A until the base line was reached and eluted at 3 ml/min with a 125-ml NaCl gradient (0–1000 mm) with a slope of 8 mm/ml. Two and a half-milliliter fractions were collected during the elution. The protein peak fractions were analyzed on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel in MES buffer. The fractions containing the LEDGF or LEDGF-FLAG band were pooled and concentrated using Centriprep-30 (catalogue number 4322, Millipore, Billerica, MA) to a final volume of ∼1 ml. The concentrated sample was then loaded into a 1-ml loop and injected into a 100-ml Shodex® gel filtration column (catalogue number KW2003, Showa Denko KK, Japan) pre-equilibrated in Gel Filtration Buffer (10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). One-milliliter fractions were collected and analyzed on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel in MES buffer. Peak fractions were pooled, and protein concentration was determined. The material was aliquoted, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Purity of LEDGF was determined to be >90% by SDS-PAGE. The supernatant (S1) derived from the centrifugation of cell homogenates (see above) was loaded at 3 ml/min onto a 10-ml amylose resin high flow column (catalogue number E8022S, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). After washing off nonspecific proteins from the column at 3 ml/min with 8–10 column volumes of Buffer A, MBP-IBD-(347–471) was eluted with Buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm maltose, 1 mm DTT). Three milliliter fractions were collected during elution. The protein peak fractions were analyzed on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel (catalogue number NP0322BOX, Invitrogen) in MES buffer. The fractions containing the ∼58-kDa MBP-IBD-(347–471) band were pooled and dialyzed overnight against Buffer C (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). The dialyzed sample was diluted five time with Buffer D (25 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 2 mm DTT), filtered, and loaded onto an anion exchange column, QHP-HiTrap (catalogue number 17-1154-01, GE Healthcare), pre-equilibrated in Buffer D. The column was then washed with 25 ml of Buffer D until base line was reached and eluted at 5 ml/min with a 125-ml NaCl gradient (0–1000 mm) with a slope of 8 mm/ml. Three milliliter fractions were collected during the elution. The protein peak fractions were analyzed on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel in MES buffer. The fractions corresponding to 100 mm NaCl containing the MBP-IBD-(347–471) band were pooled and concentrated using Centriprep-30 (catalogue number 4322, Millipore, Billerica, MA) to a final volume of ∼1 ml. The concentrated sample was then loaded into a 1-ml loop and injected into a 100-ml Shodex® gel filtration column (catalogue number KW2003, Showa Denko KK, Japan) pre-equilibrated in Gel Filtration Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). One-milliliter fractions were collected and analyzed on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel in MES buffer. Fractions corresponding to the first half of the elution peak containing the ∼58-kDa MBP-IBD-(347–471) were pooled, determined for protein concentration using the Bradford method, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The supernatant (S1) derived from the centrifugation of cell homogenates (see above) was loaded at 5 ml/min onto a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (catalogue number 17-5248-01, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in Ni Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole-HCl, 10% glycerol). After washing off nonspecific proteins from the column at 5 ml/min with 8–10 column volumes of Ni Buffer A, INCCD (F185K) was eluted with a 200-ml imidazole gradient of 20–500 mm with a slope of 2.4 mm/ml. Three milliliter fractions were collected during the elution. The protein peak fractions were analyzed on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel (catalogue number NP0322BOX, Invitrogen) in MES buffer. Fractions corresponding to 70–240 mm imidazole containing the ∼20-kDa INCCD(F185K) or 6His-IIa-INCCD(F185K) band were pooled. This pool was then diluted 10 times with SP Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.3, 1 mm DTT) adjusted to pH 6.3 and filtered. The diluted and filtered sample was loaded at 5 ml/min onto a 5-ml cation exchange HiTrap SP-HP column (catalogue number 17-1152-01, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in SP Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.3, 1 mm DTT). The column was then washed with SP Buffer A until base line was reached and eluted at 3 ml/min with a 125-ml NaCl gradient (0–1000 mm) with a slope of 8 mm/ml.

The fractions containing the 6His-INCCD(F185K) or 6His-IIa-INCCD(F185K) band were pooled and concentrated using Centriprep-30 (catalogue number 4322, Millipore, Billerica, MA) to a final volume of ∼1 ml, then loaded into a 1-ml loop, and injected into a 100-ml Shodex® gel filtration column (catalogue number KW2003, Showa Denko KK, Japan) pre-equilibrated in GF Buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT). One milliliter fractions were collected and analyzed on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel in MES buffer. Peak fractions were pooled, aliquoted, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. To generate tag free INCCD(F185K), 6His-IIa-INCCD(F185K) was cleaved with thrombin. For 8His-Tev-IN-FLAG, pellet (P1) was saved instead. The P1 pellet was homogenized in 80 ml of Lysis Buffer D (see under “Expression of Recombinant Proteins”) containing protease inhibitor mixture (1 pellet/50 ml of buffer). 8His-Tev-IN-FLAG in the homogenate was solubilized by addition of 26.7 ml of 5 m NaCl (1.25 m final) and 1.64 g of CHAPS (25 mm final). The mixture was stirred for 40 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S2) was diluted and mixed with an equal volume of Adjustment Buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CHAPS, 40 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). This diluted S2 fraction was then loaded at 5 ml/min onto a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (catalogue number 17-5248-02, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in Ni Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 600 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 10 mm CHAPS, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After washing off nonspecific proteins from the column at 5 ml/min with 8–10 column volumes of Ni Buffer A, 8His-Tev-IN-FLAG was eluted with 25 column volumes of an imidazole gradient of (20–500 mm) with a slope of 3.84 mm/ml. Three-milliliter fractions were collected during the elution. The protein peak fractions were analyzed on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel (catalogue number NP0322BOX, Invitrogen) in MES buffer. The fractions corresponding to 200–400 mm imidazole (60 ml) containing the ∼35.9-kDa 8His-Tev-IN-FLAG were pooled and dialyzed overnight in 2 liters of Ni Buffer A without imidazole at 4 °C. After dialysis, 13 ml of this pool (∼45 mg) was digested for 4 h with 2.6 mg of rTEV protease at room temperature and for an additional 2 h with an additional 1.7 mg of rTEV protease. The digested protein was loaded on a 1-ml Ni HiTrap column (catalogue number 17-5247-01, Amersham Biosciences) to remove the His8 tag and any uncleaved protein. One-third of the flow-through was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-10 membrane (catalogue number UFC901024, Millipore, Billerica, MA) to a final volume of ∼1 ml. The concentrated sample was loaded into a 1-ml loop and injected into a 100-ml Shodex® gel filtration column (catalogue number KW2003, Showa Denko KK, Japan) pre-equilibrated in Gel Filtration Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 600 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm CHAPS, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). One-milliliter fractions were collected and analyzed on a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel in MES buffer. Three peak fractions were pooled, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C. The yield of IN-FLAG was 0.1 mg/g of bacterial pellet. Protein purity based on SDS-PAGE analysis was >90%. The final protein preparation had a concentration of 0.14 mg/ml. An assay was devised to measure the interaction between HIV-1 integrase and LEDGF using a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer format (HTRF). In this assay, we make use of an integrase that is N-terminally tagged with hexahistidine (6His-IN) and a LEDGF that is C-terminally tagged with the FLAG epitope (LEDGF-FLAG). Anti-6His-XL665 and anti-FLAG-EuCryptate antibodies (catalogue numbers 61HISXLA and 61FG2KLA, Cisbio-US, Inc., Bedford, MA), which bind, respectively, to the His6 and FLAG tags, were added to allow fluorescence resonance energy transfer when LEDGF interacted with integrase (Fig. 1). To test competitors in this assay, 6His-IN, LEDGF-FLAG, and competitor were mixed in 60 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in a well of a 96-well half-area white flat bottom plate (catalogue number 3693, Corning Glass). Fifteen microliters of antibody conjugates in binding buffer were then added to start equilibrium binding. The equilibrium binding mixture contained 10 nm 6His-IN, 10 nm LEDGF-FLAG, serial 2.2-fold dilutions of the competitor, 0.45 nm anti-FLAG-EuCryptate, and 10 nm anti-6His-XL665 in binding buffer. After 6 h of incubation at 4 °C, KF was added to a final concentration of 100 mm in each well to prevent quenching of europium fluorescence before reading. The plate was read in an Envision 2102 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer Life Scie"
https://openalex.org/W2061792634,"Nearly every cellular process requires the presence of ATP. This is reflected in the vast number of enzymes like kinases or ATP hydrolases, both of which cleave the terminal phosphate from ATP, thereby releasing ADP. Despite the fact that ATP hydrolysis is one of the most fundamental reactions in biological systems, there are only a few methods available for direct measurements of enzymatic-driven ATP conversion. Here we describe the development of a reagentless biosensor for ADP, the common product of all ATPases and kinases, which allows the real-time detection of ADP, produced enzymatically. The biosensor is derived from a bacterial actin homologue, ParM, as protein framework. A single fluorophore (a diethylaminocoumarin), attached to ParM at the edge of the nucleotide binding site, couples ADP binding to a >3.5-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The labeled ParM variant has high affinity for ADP (0.46 μm) and a fast signal response, controlled by the rate of ADP binding to the sensor (0.65 μm−1s−1). Amino acids in the active site were mutated to reduce ATP affinity and achieve a >400-fold discrimination against triphosphate binding. A further mutation ensured that the final sensor did not form filaments and, as a consequence, has extremely low ATPase activity. The broad applicability of N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC)-ParM as a sensitive probe for ADP is demonstrated in real-time kinetic assays on two different ATPases and a protein kinase.

ATP conversion to ADP is a central process in all living organisms and is catalyzed by a vast number of different enzymes. ATP hydrolysis drives most energy-dependent cellular functions, such as metabolic processes, directed transport, force-generation, and movement. Kinases phosphorylate a wide variety of substrates from metabolic intermediates to proteins, so controlling their activity. Hence, assays to monitor the common product, ADP, have wide applications in biochemical and biomedical research ranging from a detailed understanding of mechanochemical coupling in motor proteins to screening for ATPase and kinase inhibitors. Despite the importance of ADP detection in biological systems, there are only a few methods available to date to monitor ADP, including coupled enzyme assays (1.Charter N.W. Kauffman L. Singh R.

Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2006; 10: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An alternative approach is to take advantage of the highly specific interaction of the target molecule with a cognate binding protein. By attaching a fluorophore in a suitable position on the protein, ligand recognition can be coupled to an optical signal. Such fluorescent, protein-based sensors have been reported for a number of biomolecules such as sugars, amino acids, metal ions, and phosphate (6.Gilardi G. Zhou L.Q. Hibbert L. Cass A.E.G. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R.

This technology offers a number of advantages; the signal change can be very fast, limited only by the speed of ligand binding or the associated conformational change, and only a single component, the labeled protein, is needed for detection. Such a reagentless biosensor has been developed previously which responds to a wide range of ADP/ATP ratios (11.Brune M. Corrie J.E.. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5087-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the applicability of this sensor is narrowed for the reasons that the fluorescence decreases with ADP, and this is less favorable than an increase, because the sensitivity is lower and the signal response is not linear. Here we report the development of an ADP-specific sensor using ParM as the binding protein. ParM, an actin homologue from Escherichia coli involved in plasmid segregation (12.Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 13.van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), was chosen as the protein scaffold for the sensor development for the following reasons. First, because of its prokaryotic origin and relatively small size, it can be strongly overexpressed in E. coli and, therefore, is available in large quantities. Second, crystal structures indicate that ParM undergoes a large conformation change upon ADP binding (13.van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) that facilitates the rational design of labeling positions, where fluorophores are likely to respond to ADP binding. Third, ParM has a high affinity for ADP (14.Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which is advantageous for ADP detection with high sensitivity. The ParM structure has been solved in four different states, the nucleotide-free form as well as complexes with different nucleotides (13.van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 15.Popp D. Narita A. Oda T. Fujisawa T. Matsuo H. Nitanai Y. Iwasa M. Maeda K. Onishi H. Maéda Y. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ParM consists of two domains (I and II) that are both further divided into subdomains A and B. The nucleotide binding site is located in a cleft between the two domains with residues from both contributing to the interaction. In the absence of nucleotide, ParM is in an open conformation. The structure of the ADP complex shows a large (25°) rigid body movement of the two domains relative to each other, leading to cleft closure (Fig. 1) (13.van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although ParM has many advantageous characteristics for its development as a reagentless biosensor, there are also several properties that are potentially deleterious and need circumventing. A problem for any ADP assay is that it is likely to be performed in the presence of a large excess of ATP as substrate, which may bind and inhibit assay components. In the case of a biosensor that is based on binding ADP, discrimination against ATP binding is a necessity. A second problem is that ParM can form filaments (13.van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which may affect the fluorescence signal and/or nucleotide binding. Finally, ParM has low ATPase activity, which may interfere with the assay. In principle, all these potential difficulties can be addressed by manipulation of the protein, particularly by mutagenesis. By engineering the bacterial actin ParM, we have developed a biosensor that responds to ADP binding with a large fluorescence increase, produced by a single coumarin label, MDCC. 2The abbreviations used are: MDCCN-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxamidePBPphosphate-binding proteinMDCC-PBPthe A197C mutant of the PBP of E. coli labeled with MDCCethenoADP1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-diphosphateethenoATP1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphateGMPPNPguanosine-5′-[(β,γ)imido]-triphosphatemantADPN-methyl-anthraniloyl-adenosine 5′-diphosphatemantATPN-methyl-anthraniloyl-adenosine 5′-triphosphateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. The sensor has submicromolar affinity for ADP and a fast signal response. By mutating the ParM active site, we constructed a sensor variant that strongly discriminates against ATP, binding ATP >400-fold weaker than ADP. In addition, filament formation is greatly reduced in the MDCC-ParM variant, and therefore, the ATPase activity is very low. The biosensor is applied in real-time measurements of ATPase and kinase activity.

Plasmid pJSC1 for recombinant synthesis of wild-type ParM was provided by J. Löwe (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK) (16.Salje J. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2230-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Point mutations in ParM were introduced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using pJSC1 as template. For all variants except those containing only the initial cysteine mutations, the ParM expression plasmid was modified so that the protein has a C-terminal hexahistidine tag for simpler and faster purification. ParM variants with a C-terminal His6 tag were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotides 5′-GTATCTCATAGGTAATCAATCAGGATCCCATCATCATCATCATC-3′ and 5′-GATGATGGGATCCTGATTGATTACCTATGAGATACATACCG-3′. The mutagenic PCR changes the two stop codons after the ParM gene on pJSC1 to codons for Gln and Gly followed by a one-base deletion, so that the vector-encoded His6 tag is expressed. The ParM (His6) constructs contain the 10-amino acid extension QSGSHHHHHH at the C terminus. ParM variants were synthesized in E. coli BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen). ParM expression cultures were grown at 30 °C in 2×TY medium containing 100 μg of ml−1 ampicillin until the A600 was 0.4–0.6 cm−1, when overexpression was induced by the addition of 2 mg liter−1 arabinose. Cells were harvested after 16 h induction, resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), and stored at −80 °C. ParM (His6) mutants were purified by nickel-chelate chromatography (for purification of ParM variants without the His6 tag, see the Supplemental Methods). Cleared cell extracts were supplemented with 500 mm NaCl and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter (Sartorius). The lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A (30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl). The column was washed with buffer A until the absorbance at 280 nm reached the base line followed by 50 ml of buffer B (30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl). ParM was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–250 mm imidazole in buffer B adjusted to pH 8.0. Fractions containing ParM were pooled, and 10 mm dithiothreitol was added. Protein solutions were concentrated using a Vivaspin-20 centrifugal concentrator (Vivascience) before loading on a gel filtration column. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a 120-ml HiLoad Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in 30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were concentrated in a Vivaspin-20 centrifugal concentrator (Vivascience) to 30–100 mg ml−1. ParM concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient 34,380 m−1cm−1 calculated from the primary sequence (17.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). Aliquots were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Labeling of the final sensor variant ParM (His6/I27C/K33A/T174A/T175N/C287A) was typically carried out on a scale of ∼100 mg of protein. Labeling reactions contained 150 μm ParM and 250 μm MDCC in 30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl. The reaction mixture was incubated for 35 min and end-over-end mixing at 22 °C. 2 mm sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate was added, and incubation was continued for 15 min. The solution was filtered through a 0.2-μm Acrodisc filter (Pall Corp.) and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl. The column was washed with the same buffer until the 280-nm absorbance reached base line. A 200-ml linear gradient of 25–400 mm KCl was applied. The main peak of labeled ParM, eluting at ∼130 mm KCl, was pooled, and MDCC-ParM was concentrated as described above. The concentration of labeled ParM was determined using the extinction coefficients for MDCC coupled to dithiothreitol (7.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), ϵ430 = 46800 m−1cm−1 and ϵ280 = 7470 m−1 cm−1, and the extinction coefficient of ParM given above. The identity of the labeled ParM variant was confirmed by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry. The measured molecular mass was 37,214.8 Da, conforming to the theoretical mass of the ParM construct labeled with a single MDCC, 37,214.5 Da. Adenine and guanine nucleotides (Sigma) were obtained at the highest purity available. The purity of the nucleotides was analyzed by HPLC using a Partisphere-SAX column (125 × 4.5 mm, Whatman). Isocratic separation of nucleotides was performed with 0.3 m (NH4)2HPO4, adjusted to pH 4.0 with HCl and containing 25% MeOH (v/v). The absorbance was monitored at 260 nm. Commercial ATP contained typically ∼0.7% ADP. For determination of the ATP affinity of labeled ParM mutants, the ATP was further purified on a 100-ml DEAE-cellulose column using a linear gradient of 10 to 600 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 7.4 over 2000 ml. Fractions were analyzed by HPLC as described above. The purest fractions were pooled and rotary-evaporated to dryness under high vacuum at room temperature. ATP was washed four times with methanol by redissolving the solid in 50 ml of methanol and subsequent rotary evaporation. The dry solid was redissolved in water and stored at −80 °C. This procedure yielded ATP, which contained <0.1% ADP, as measured by HPLC. Nucleotide concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements using the extinction coefficients ϵ259 = 15,400 M−1cm−1 and ϵ253 = 13,700 M−1cm−1 for adenine and guanine nucleotides, respectively. Fluorescence spectra, titrations, and slow kinetics were measured at 20 °C using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian). Fluorescence spectra and titrations were carried out in 30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 μm bovine serum albumin unless otherwise stated. MDCC fluorescence was excited at 431 nm, and emission was recorded at 474 nm. Titrations of MDCC-labeled ParM variants with adenine nucleotides were analyzed with a quadratic binding curve using Grafit software (18.Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK2001Google Scholar), F=Fmin+(Fmax-Fmin)(Kd+P+L-((Kd+P+L)2-4PL)1/2)/2P(Eq. 1) where P and L are the total concentrations of protein and ligand, respectively, Kd is the dissociation constant, and Fmin and Fmax are the fluorescence intensities of the free and ligand-bound protein. Steady-state activity measurements of PcrA helicase and PknB kinase were performed with the ADP biosensor MDCC-ParM (His6/I27C/K33A/T174A/T175N/C287A). The helicase assay was carried out in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2; for the kinase assay, 30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol were used. MDCC fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 431 and 474 nm, respectively. The concentrations used in the experiments are given in the respective figure legends. For calibration of the sensor response, MDCC-ParM at the concentration used in the assay was titrated with ADP, and the fluorescence was recorded. To account for the different fluorescence responses when ATP is present, these titrations were carried out at a series of different, initial ATP concentrations (see Fig. 2D). Thereby, the total nucleotide concentration, ATP+ADP, was held constant during the titrations, and only the ADP content was changed. This was achieved by incubating MDCC-ParM plus a particular ATP concentration in the cuvette and then titrating with an ADP solution of the same concentration as ATP in the cuvette, which also contained MDCC-ParM at the cuvette concentration. By linear regression, a gradient was obtained for each initial ATP concentration, corresponding to the change in fluorescence intensity per micromolar ADP. Instead of performing such a calibration for each initial ATP concentration used in the helicase or kinase assay, the titrations were performed at only four different total nucleotide concentrations. The calibrations for the other concentrations were then obtained by interpolation. Titrations were measured at 3, 6, 10, and 15 μm initial ATP for the PcrA assay and 10, 20, 30 and 40 μm for the PknB assay as well as in the absence of ATP. The gradients obtained in these titrations were plotted versus the initial ATP concentration. For each initial ATP concentration a gradient for calibration was then calculated by linear interpolation, and these were used to calculate the ADP concentrations from the fluorescence signal. Stopped-flow experiments were carried out at 20 °C using a HiTech SF61 DX2 stopped-flow instrument equipped with a Xe/Hg lamp (TgK Scientific, UK). MDCC fluorescence was excited at 436 nm, and emission was detected with a photomultiplier after filtering scattered light through a 455-nm cut-off filter. ADP binding kinetics of MDCC-ParM was measured in 30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 μm bovine serum albumin. Association kinetics were measured under pseudo-first order conditions with at least a 10-fold excess of ADP over ParM. In displacement experiments to determine the dissociation rate constants, the preformed complex of MDCC-ParM and ADP was mixed with a 100–400-fold excess of unlabeled ParM. Single exponential curve-fitting was performed with the HiTech software. Phosphate and ADP release kinetics during a single turnover of ATP hydrolysis by SufBC from Thermotoga maritima were measured with the phosphate biosensor MDCC-PBP (19.Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and the ADP sensor MDCC-ParM, respectively. Measurements were carried out in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. A solution of 13 μm SufBC containing the respective biosensor (20 μm MDCC-PBP or 80 μm MDCC-ParM) was rapidly mixed with a 4 μm ATP solution. Pi release data were analyzed by single exponential curve-fitting using Grafit software. ADP release kinetics could be described by assuming two successive irreversible steps, where ADP is released in the second step. Curve fits were carried out with Grafit using the equation, F=A(1+(k2/(k1-k2))exp(-k1t)+(k1/(k2-k1)exp(-k2t))+F0(Eq. 2) where F0 is the fluorescence at time point zero, A is the total fluorescence change, and k1 and k2 are the rate constants of the two first order reactions. To measure ADP dissociation kinetics from the SufBC complex, 13 μm SufBC and 4 μm ADP was preincubated in one syringe before rapidly mixing with 80 or 160 μm MDCC-ParM. Data were analyzed by single exponential curve-fitting using the HiTech software. The rate constant was only 10% different between the measurements with 80 and 160 μm MDCC-ParM. Wild-type ParM contains two cysteine residues; Cys-100 is buried in a hydrophobic core and is probably inaccessible to labeling, whereas Cys-287 (Fig. 1) is solvent-exposed and likely to be modified by cysteine-reactive fluorophores. Having shown that the latter cysteine was not useful as a fluorophore site (supplemental Table S1), it was mutated to alanine, and new cysteine residues were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into this C287A variant. After examination of the structure of ParM and the nucleotide-induced conformation change, six different labeling positions were identified where an attached fluorophore might experience a large change in environment when ADP binds. These are positioned on the surface, close to the ADP-triggered cleft closure. The ParM mutants, containing one reactive cysteine each, were labeled with different probes, and fluorescence spectra were recorded in the absence and presence of ADP. Only ParM (I27C/C287A) responded to ADP with an increase in fluorescence intensity, whereas all other mutants showed a less favorable signal decrease (supplemental Table S1). The largest response was obtained with the coumarin derivative, MDCC, which gave a 3-fold fluorescence increase (Fig. 2A). This adduct, MDCC-ParM (I27C/C287A), was chosen for further study and development. The sensitivity of ADP detection depends on both the inherent fluorescence change and ADP affinity. The ADP affinity of MDCC-ParM (I27C/C287A) was determined by titration using the fluorescence change upon ADP binding (Fig. 2B and Table 1). The dissociation constant, 0.31 μm, is ∼8-fold lower than the value determined for ethenoADP binding to wild-type ParM (20.Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Dissociation constants and fluorescence changes for binding of ADP and ATP to MDCC-ParM mutants at different stages of the sensor developmentParM mutantADPATPKd ratio, ATP/ADPF+ADP/F−ADPKdF+ADP/F−ADPKdμmμmI27C/C287A3.00.313.118.760I27C/T174A/T175N/C287A3.50.513.3203398I27C/K33A/T174A/T175N/C287A3.50.463.2212460 Open table in a new tab A main challenge in the development of any ADP-specific biosensor that is based on binding is to achieve good discrimination against ATP. Titration of MDCC-ParM (I27C/C287A) with ATP yielded a dissociation constant of 18.7 μm, 60-fold higher than the dissociation constant of the ADP complex (Fig. 2B and Table 1). The size of the fluorescence change was similar to that obtained with ADP. This weaker binding of ATP was not expected, as wild-type ParM binds the fluorescent analogue ethenoATP with 60-fold higher affinity than ethenoADP (20.Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, the ATP affinity relative to that of ADP is still too high for many applications, and therefore, the ParM nucleotide binding site was mutated to further increase discrimination against ATP. The crystal structures of ParM in complex with ADP (13.van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GMPPNP (15.Popp D. Narita A. Oda T. Fujisawa T. Matsuo H. Nitanai Y. Iwasa M. Maeda K. Onishi H. Maéda Y. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) indicate a very similar conformation of the protein in the diphosphate and triphosphate states. Examination of these structures suggested mutations that might weaken ATP binding without changing the ADP affinity. First, the side chains of Ser-9, Thr-174, and Thr-175 form hydrogen bonds to the γ-phosphate of GMPPNP (15.Popp D. Narita A. Oda T. Fujisawa T. Matsuo H. Nitanai Y. Iwasa M. Maeda K. Onishi H. Maéda Y. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) but are not within hydrogen-bonding distance of the ADP (13.van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Removing these hydroxyl side chains by mutation to alanine might, therefore, selectively weaken triphosphate binding. The second approach was to block the γ-phosphate binding site by introducing more bulky amino acids at positions 9, 148, and 175. On the background of ParM (His6/I27C/C287A), 10 different active site mutant proteins were generated, labeled with MDCC, and analyzed for ADP and ATP binding affinity (supplemental Table S2). The best combination of active site mutations in terms of selectivity for ADP was T174A/T175N; this mutant bound ATP ∼400-fold weaker than ADP while retaining tight affinity for ADP and a large fluorescence enhancement (Table 1). This construct, ParM (His6/I27C/T174A/T175N/C287A), was used for further experiments. Wild-type ParM forms actin-like filaments, which are essential for its function in plasmid segregation (21.Møller-Jensen J. Jensen R.B. Löwe J. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) but could disturb the sensor function of ParM. Filament formation may interfere with the fluorescence signal, and the ATPase activity of ParM is strongly enhanced in the filament (20.Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21.Møller-Jensen J. Jensen R.B. Löwe J. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The polymerization of MDCC-ParM (His6/I27C/T174A/T175N/C287A) was investigated using light scattering. At 10–40 μm, this variant formed filaments when ATP was added but not with ADP or in the absence of nucleotide (supplemental Fig. S1A). The nucleation and polymerization kinetics were much slower than for wild-type ParM, but the critical concentration, 2.5 μm, was very similar to wild-type ParM (20.Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore, further mutations were introduced to block filament formation. Among others, the two point mutations K33A and R34A have been shown to inhibit filament formation (16.Salje J. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2230-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and these residues participate in interactions between protomers in a model of the ParM filament (15.Popp D. Narita A. Oda T. Fujisawa T. Matsuo H. Nitanai Y. Iwasa M. Maeda K. Onishi H. Maéda Y. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have introduced each mutation into ParM (His6/I27C/T174A/T175N/C287A) and analyzed the labeled proteins for polymerization. Light scattering assays showed that the K33A mutation blocks filament formation more efficiently; no increase in light scattering was detected over a period of 4 h even at very high (120 μm) concentrations of the sensor (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus, the ParM variant containing the K33A mutation, MDCC-ParM (His6/I27C/K33A/T174A/T175N/C287A), was chosen as the final ADP biosensor, hereafter referred to as MDCC-ParM. As mentioned above, filament formation is related to an acceleration of ATP hydrolysis, and therefore, the K33A mutation is expected to decrease ATPase activity. The ATPase rate of MDCC-ParM was measured using a phosphate biosensor, rhodamine-PBP (adduct of the A17C/A197C double mutant of E. coli phosphate-binding protein with two molecules of 6-iodoacetamidotetramethylrhodamine) (22.Okoh M.P. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14764-14771Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (data not shown). ATP hydrolysis was very slow, with a rate constant of <0.001 min−1, which is >10-fold lower than MDCC-ParM without the K33A mutation. Thus, the K33A mutation not only blocks filament formation but thereby also inhibits ATPase activity. Titrations of MDCC-ParM with ADP and ATP showed that the K33A mutation did not alter ADP affinity and discri"

We have previously shown that breast cancer cells secrete factors able to directly stimulate osteoclastogenesis from receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-primed precursors and that transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) plays a permissive role in this process. Now, we evaluate the signaling events triggered in osteoclast precursors by soluble factors produced by MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells. In mouse bone marrow cultures and RAW 264.7 murine monocytic cells, MDA-MB-231-derived factors increased osteoclast number, size, and nucleation. These factors failed to induce Smad2 phosphorylation, and short interfering RNAs against Smad4 did not affect their ability to induce osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 factors induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2, and pharmacological inhibitors against p38 (SB203580) and MEK1/2 (PD98059) impeded the osteoclastogenic effects of cancer-derived factors. Neutralizing antibodies against TGFβ attenuated p38 activation, whereas activation of ERK1/2 was shortened in duration, but not decreased in amplitude. ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by cancer-derived factors was blocked by MEK1/2 inhibitor, but not by Ras (manumycin A) or Raf (GW5074) inhibitors. Inhibition of protein kinase Cα using Gö6976 prevented both ERK1/2 phosphorylation and osteoclast formation in response to MDA-MB-231-derived factors. Using microspectrofluorimetry of fura-2-AM-loaded osteoclast precursors, we have found that cancer-derived factors, similar to RANKL, induced sustained oscillations in cytosolic free calcium. The calcium chelator BAPTA prevented calcium elevations and osteoclast formation in response to MDA-MB-231-derived factors.

https://openalex.org/W2051464456,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays major roles in embryonic development and has also been associated with the progression of certain cancers. Here, Shh family members act directly as long range morphogens, and their ability to do so has been linked to the formation of freely diffusible multimers from the lipidated, cell-tethered monomer (ShhNp). In this work we demonstrate that the multimeric morphogen secreted from endogenous sources, such as mouse embryos and primary chick chondrocytes, consists of oligomeric substructures that are “undisruptable” by boiling, denaturants, and reducing agents. Undisruptable (UD) morphogen oligomers vary in molecular weight and possess elevated biological activity if compared with recombinant Sonic hedgehog (ShhN). However, ShhN can also undergo UD oligomerization via a heparan sulfate (HS)-dependent mechanism in vitro, and HS isolated from different sources differs in its ability to mediate UD oligomer formation. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved ShhN glutamine residues abolishes UD oligomerization, and inhibitors directed against transglutaminase (TG) activity strongly decrease the amount of chondrocyte-secreted UD oligomers. These findings reveal an unsuspected ability of the N-terminal hedgehog (Hh) signaling domain to form biologically active, covalently cross-linked oligomers and a novel HS function in this TG-catalyzed process.

In vertebrates, three closely related Hh morphogens (Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert hedgehog) have been described, and a single ortholog is expressed in Drosophila melanogaster. Production of active morphogen begins with the cleavage of the signal sequence followed by autocatalytic cleavage of the 45-kDa precursor molecule to yield a 19-kDa N-terminal signaling domain. This domain becomes C-terminal-cholesterol-modified during processing and N-terminal-palmitoylated, resulting in a dual-lipidated molecule tightly bound to the surface of producing cells that constitutes the active morphogen (called ShhNp, if derived from the Shh precursor, or IhhNp, if derived from the Ihh precursor) (1.Jacob L. Lum L. Science. 2007; 318: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the (Drosophila) cell surface, lipidated morphogen monomers are organized into suboptical oligomers that are further recruited to preexisting heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-rich membrane subdomains to form large, visible multimeric clusters (2.Vyas N. Goswami D. Manonmani A. Sharma P. Ranganath H.A. VijayRaghavan K. Shashidhara L.S. Sowdhamini R. Mayor S. Cell. 2008; 133: 1214-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Morphogen release from the cell surface then depends on the expression of Dispatched (3.Ma Y. Erkner A. Gong R. Yao S. Taipale J. Basler K. Beachy P.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family members. The latter mediate morphogen shedding in an HS-regulated way, as has recently been shown for ShhNp in transfected Bosc23 cells, a HEK 293T-derived cell line (4.Dierker T. Dreier R. Petersen A. Bordych C. Grobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8013-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).In addition to HS-regulated ShhNp shedding, HS is also involved in the formation of the Hh extracellular gradient, which in the fly depends on the HS co-polymerase Tout-velu (Ttv, exostosin in vertebrates) and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked HSPGs Dally and Dally-like, corresponding to vertebrate glypicans (5.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 6.Desbordes S.C. Sanson B.

Dev Cell. 2008; 14: 712-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Exostosins synthesize the HS (GlcA1,4GlcNAc1,4)n carbohydrate backbone, which is modified by N-deacetylase/sulfotransferases, O-sulfotransferases, and a GlcA-C5 epimerase. Many growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, and morphogens bind to HS, and the HSPGs are thought to act as co-receptors for these ligands (8.Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). In this work we show a new HS function in hedgehog signaling; that is, the HS-dependent formation of oligomeric substructures stabilized by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-links.Eight transglutaminases (TGs) are encoded in the human genome, and at least two have been shown to be secreted forms that participate in extracellular matrix remodeling; they are tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and factor XIIIa (fXIIIa). TGs catalyze covalent ϵ-(γ-glutaminyl)lysyl interprotein cross-links in a Ca2+-dependent manner, resulting in the generation of supermolecular structures with extra rigidity and resistance against proteolytic degradation (for review, see Ref. 9.Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). TG activity is involved in the development of the heart, lung, and the central nervous system in addition to salivary gland development, blood clotting, and other processes. The two extracellular TGs, TG2 and fXIIIa, undergo up-regulation, which is physiological in growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes and pathological up-regulation in osteoarthritic cartilage (10.Johnson K.A.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2607-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and myelin basic protein have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and progressive suprabulbar palsy in which the abnormal accumulation of insoluble proteinaceous aggregates causes progressive neuronal death (14.Kim S.Y. Jeitner T.M. Steinert P.M. Neurochem Int. 2002; 40: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Here, we identified members of the Hh family as new targets for TG cross-linking activity, adding new substrates to the extensive list of TG-cross-linked extracellular proteins.DISCUSSIONThe detection of oligomer formation by SDS-PAGE and/or Western blotting and inhibition of protein cross-linking by bifunctional amines is widely used to identify TG protein substrates. In this work we demonstrate by SDS-PAGE the formation of HhNp oligomers starting from the endogenously produced monomers and confirmed the identity of in vitro generated ShhN oligomers by employing two different Hh-specific antibodies in combination with two monoclonal antibodies directed against Myc and hexahistidine tags as well as LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of in vitro generated ShhN oligomers. Notably, heparin increased HhNp complex formation in chondrocyte cultures, and ShhN effectively formed oligomers in the presence of specific forms of HS. We also made the observation that the formation of large (120 and 180 kDa) oligomers was efficiently inhibited by a range of TG-specific abortive substrates and an inhibitor; however, the 75-kDa form was less affected. Indeed, the incomplete inhibition of UD oligomerization by a range of TG inhibitors is not compatible with the mode of de novo direct polymerization of proteins in a single-phased reaction, which constitutes one type of TG-mediated protein cross-linking reaction. Examples for this type of reaction would be the formation of the vaginal plug after copulation in rodents (31.Williams-Ashman H.G. Notides A.C. Pabalan S.S. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1972; 69: 2322-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and lobster hemolymph clotting (32.Lorand L. Doolittle R.F. Konishi K. Riggs S.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 102: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Notably, another type of known TG action is only incompletely affected by inhibitors or analogue substrates of TGs (9.Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) and can be described as the enzymatic “spot-welding” of non-covalent (e.g. reversible) assemblies. Here, cross-linking occurs in a two-phase system that uses a preformed polymer scaffold, and TG contributes only to the stabilization (maturation) of a preformed reversible polymer structure (9.Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). An example for this second type of TG-mediated reaction is the coagulation of blood. After limited proteolysis of fibrinogen by thrombin, fibrin molecules self-assemble into an array of protofibrils and fibrils, ultimately forming a clot network. The cross-linking enzyme, fXIIIa, then introduces a few strategically located bridges into the preformed, labile polymer to stabilize the clot. Analogous to this process, we suggest that by binding to cell-surface HS chains, membrane-tethered, lipidated HhNp proteins or preformed nanocomplexes (2.Vyas N. Goswami D. Manonmani A. Sharma P. Ranganath H.A. VijayRaghavan K. Shashidhara L.S. Sowdhamini R. Mayor S. Cell. 2008; 133: 1214-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) may first assemble into labile multimers similar or identical to those described previously (Fig. 7). In vivo, HhNp protein binding to specifically sulfated HS “scaffolds” may bring Gln-47 and an unidentified lysine residue provided by another monomer into close proximity, allowing for subsequent TG-mediated isopeptide linkage. This will result in UD oligomer formation within labile multimers.However, although our model would also predict the formation and release of UD oligomeric HhNp from Drosophila cells, surface plasmon resonance studies showed negligible binding of the fly morphogen to HS but strong binding to heparin (33.Zhang F. McLellan J.S. Ayala A.M. Leahy D.J. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3933-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, ShhN bound not only to heparin but (although to a lesser extent) also to porcine intestinal HS that was employed in the study. These observations may reflect a strong preference of fly HhNp for highly sulfated regions or forms of HSPGs possibly related to sequence variations within the HS binding CW motif (murine ShhN, GKRRHPKK; fly HhN, LGRHRARN; CW consensus, XBBBXXBX, B indicates basic amino acid residues (25.Rubin J.B. Choi Y. Segal R.A. Development. 2002; 129: 2223-2232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Alternatively, HS binding of fly HhNp may require specific binding motifs that were likely absent from the porcine HS used in the assay (33.Zhang F. McLellan J.S. Ayala A.M. Leahy D.J. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3933-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) but may be expressed on functional fly HS in vivo. This possibility is supported by the finding that Drosophila HhNp colocalizes with HSPGs in vivo and that fly HhNp/HSPG colocalization was abolished upon deletion of the HS binding CW sequence (2.Vyas N. Goswami D. Manonmani A. Sharma P. Ranganath H.A. VijayRaghavan K. Shashidhara L.S. Sowdhamini R. Mayor S. Cell. 2008; 133: 1214-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is further supported by specific HS requirements for efficient ShhN binding and UD oligomerization in vitro, as shown in this work. The requirement for specific HS motifs may, thus, also explain why ShhN or ShhNp expressed in transfected cell lines were only found as monomers or as labile multimers, in contrast to endogenously expressed HhNp isolated from cultured chondrocytes (19.Zeng X. Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Robbins D.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Possibly, heterologous expression systems lack the specifically sulfated HS isoforms required for UD oligomerization and may also lack TG expression, resulting in the generation of only labile morphogen multimers (representing the preformed polymer) (Fig. 7). In contrast, endogenous production of HhNp in vivo may be coordinated with specific HS synthesis and TG secretion, resulting in the regulated formation of covalently cross-linked and biologically active UD oligomers within the preformed polymers. For these reasons, the formation of UD oligomers found in the in vivo situation was undetectable in previous studies, relying on protein expression in transfected cells. Importantly, TG avidly binds to heparin, but heparin binding only slightly affects TG activity in vitro (34.Gambetti S. Dondi A. Cervellati C. Squerzanti M. Pansini F.S. Bergamini C.M. Biochimie. 2005; 87: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggests that UD oligomerization is not merely a result of HS-dependent TG activation.What may be the function of UD oligomers in specific developmental settings, and what may be their site of expression? Elevated activity of TG2 and fXIIIa have been described as additional features of hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes (35.Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 36.Nurminskaya M. Linsenmayer T.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 785: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Notably, the hypertrophic phenotype can be induced by thyroid hormones in growth plate chondrocytes, and T4 also stimulates TG activity in the extracellular matrix of articular chondrocytes (37.Rosenthal A.K. Heinkel D. Gohr C.M. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2003; 11: 463-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We, thus, suggest that at in the Ca2+-rich environment of the developing bone, TG-producing hypertrophic chondrocytes may secrete UD oligomers with specific advantages over the labile multimer or the monomeric form. These advantages may include the possibility of allosteric control, higher local concentration of active sites, larger binding surfaces, and the generation of novel active sites at the subunit interfaces. Those features may all strongly affect the formation of the extracellular morphogen gradient and interaction with the hedgehog receptor Patched. In this work we show enhanced biological activity of UD oligomers and possibly also of labile multimers over the monomeric form. This may be due to the clustering of multiple molecules of the hedgehog receptor Patched, in turn effectively reducing its interaction with Smoothened. Alternatively, increased biological activity of UD oligomers may be explained by increased protein stability in the extracellular matrix due to resistance against proteolytic degradation, consistent with other TG extracellular matrix substrates (9.Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar).In addition to being involved in normal developmental processes, as shown in mouse embryos or hypertrophic chondrocytes isolated from chick embryos, our findings may also play a role in pathophysiological conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA). Pathologic hypertrophic differentiation also occurs in articular chondrocytes in OA in situ and has the potential to promote OA progression through pathological calcification (38.Kirsch T. Swoboda B. Nah H. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Both fXIIIa and TG2 are molecular markers of chondrocyte differentiation in the growth plate (35.Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 39.Nurminskaya M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and TG2 and fXIIIa expression as well as TG activity are up-regulated in human knee OA cartilage chondrocytes (40.Johnson K. Hashimoto S. Lotz M. Pritzker K. Terkeltaub R. Am J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 149-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because hypertrophic chondrocytes express TG-linked HhNp oligomers that strongly induced C3H10T1/2 differentiation into osteoblasts in our assays, the findings presented in this work may result in a better understanding of the pathology of OA. In addition to a putative role of UD oligomerization in OA, the novel mechanism suggested here comprising multimerization of Hh proteins by HS scaffold modulation followed by TG-catalyzed cross-linking may also be involved in initiation and progression of neurodegenerative disease. In these scenarios TGs have been implicated in the abnormal accumulation of insoluble and protease-resistant proteinaceous aggregates (14.Kim S.Y. Jeitner T.M. Steinert P.M. Neurochem Int. 2002; 40: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, HS is co-distributed with the abnormal prion protein, PrP(Sc), even in very early disease stages in scrapie-infected mice (41.Leteux C. Chai W. Nagai K. Herbert C.G. Lawson A.M. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12539-12545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that HS may also serve as a scaffold for protein aggregation in these pathophysiological conditions.

In vertebrates, three closely related Hh morphogens (Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert hedgehog) have been described, and a single ortholog is expressed in Drosophila melanogaster. Production of active morphogen begins with the cleavage of the signal sequence followed by autocatalytic cleavage of the 45-kDa precursor molecule to yield a 19-kDa N-terminal signaling domain. This domain becomes C-terminal-cholesterol-modified during processing and N-terminal-palmitoylated, resulting in a dual-lipidated molecule tightly bound to the surface of producing cells that constitutes the active morphogen (called ShhNp, if derived from the Shh precursor, or IhhNp, if derived from the Ihh precursor) (1.Jacob L. Lum L. Science. 2007; 318: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the (Drosophila) cell surface, lipidated morphogen monomers are organized into suboptical oligomers that are further recruited to preexisting heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-rich membrane subdomains to form large, visible multimeric clusters (2.Vyas N. Goswami D. Manonmani A. Sharma P. Ranganath H.A. VijayRaghavan K. Shashidhara L.S. Sowdhamini R. Mayor S. Cell. 2008; 133: 1214-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Morphogen release from the cell surface then depends on the expression of Dispatched (3.Ma Y. Erkner A. Gong R. Yao S. Taipale J. Basler K. Beachy P.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family members. The latter mediate morphogen shedding in an HS-regulated way, as has recently been shown for ShhNp in transfected Bosc23 cells, a HEK 293T-derived cell line (4.Dierker T. Dreier R. Petersen A. Bordych C. Grobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8013-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).In addition to HS-regulated ShhNp shedding, HS is also involved in the formation of the Hh extracellular gradient, which in the fly depends on the HS co-polymerase Tout-velu (Ttv, exostosin in vertebrates) and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked HSPGs Dally and Dally-like, corresponding to vertebrate glypicans (5.Bellaiche Y.

Exostosins synthesize the HS (GlcA1,4GlcNAc1,4)n carbohydrate backbone, which is modified by N-deacetylase/sulfotransferases, O-sulfotransferases, and a GlcA-C5 epimerase. Many growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, and morphogens bind to HS, and the HSPGs are thought to act as co-receptors for these ligands (8.Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). In this work we show a new HS function in hedgehog signaling; that is, the HS-dependent formation of oligomeric substructures stabilized by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-links.Eight transglutaminases (TGs) are encoded in the human genome, and at least two have been shown to be secreted forms that participate in extracellular matrix remodeling; they are tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and factor XIIIa (fXIIIa). TGs catalyze covalent ϵ-(γ-glutaminyl)lysyl interprotein cross-links in a Ca2+-dependent manner, resulting in the generation of supermolecular structures with extra rigidity and resistance against proteolytic degradation (for review, see Ref. 9.Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). TG activity is involved in the development of the heart, lung, and the central nervous system in addition to salivary gland development, blood clotting, and other processes. The two extracellular TGs, TG2 and fXIIIa, undergo up-regulation, which is physiological in growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes and pathological up-regulation in osteoarthritic cartilage (10.Johnson K.A.

Jeitner T.M. Steinert P.M. Neurochem Int. 2002; 40: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).

THp-(1–43) showed high affinity for 14-3-3 proteins (Kd ∼ 0.5 μm for 14-3-3γ and -ζ and 7 μm for 14-3-3η).

The affinity of 14-3-3γ for negatively charged membranes (S0.5 = 1–9 μm) is much higher than the affinity of TH for the same membranes, compatible with the formation of a ternary complex between Ser19-phosphorylated TH, 14-3-3γ, and membranes.

https://openalex.org/W2002365858,"The RNA-binding motif protein 4 (RBM4) plays multiple roles in mRNA metabolism, including translation control. RBM4 suppresses cap-dependent translation but activates internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. Because of its high expression level in muscle and heart, we investigated the function of RBM4 in myoblast cells. Here, we demonstrate that RBM4 is phosphorylated and translocates to the cytoplasm in mouse C2C12 cells upon cell differentiation. Notably, RBM4 is transiently deposited into cytoplasmic granules containing microtubule assembly factors as well as poly(A)(+) RNAs. Moreover, RBM4 colocalizes with the components of micro-ribonucleoproteins, including the Argonaute2 (Ago2) protein, during muscle cell differentiation. RBM4 interacts directly with Ago2 and may recruit Ago2 to suppress translation of target mRNAs. Furthermore, RBM4 selectively associates with muscle cell-specific microRNAs and potentiates their translation repression activity by promoting micro-ribonucleoprotein association with target mRNAs. Altogether, our results suggest that RBM4 translocates to the cytoplasm and participates in translation suppression during muscle cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2155282256,"Sulfiredoxin catalyzes the ATP-dependent reduction of overoxidized eukaryotic 2-Cys peroxiredoxin PrxSO(2) into sulfenic PrxSOH. Recent mechanistic studies on sulfiredoxins have validated a catalytic mechanism that includes formation of a phosphoryl intermediate on the sulfinyl moiety of PrxSO(2), followed by an attack of the catalytic cysteine of sulfiredoxin on the phosphoryl intermediate that leads to formation of a thiosulfinate intermediate PrxSO-S-sulfiredoxin. Formation of this intermediate implies the recycling of sulfiredoxin into the reduced form. In this study, we have investigated how the reductase activity of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae sulfiredoxin is regenerated. The results show that an oxidized sulfiredoxin under disulfide state is formed between the catalytic Cys(84) and Cys(48). This oxidized sulfiredoxin species is shown to be catalytically competent along the sulfiredoxin-recycling process and is reduced selectively by thioredoxin. The lack of Cys(48) in the mammalian sulfiredoxins and the low efficiency of reduction of the thiosulfinate intermediate by thioredoxin suggest a recycling mechanism in mammals different from that of sulfiredoxin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae."

(see Fig. 1) and the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) forms a complex that modulates the transcription of genes containing a VDR element. This process is termed a genomic response and involves 1,25D binding to the VDR, formation of a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor, and recruitment of nuclear co-activators (NCoAs) and the basal transcription machinery (1.Sutton A.L.

The current induced-fit model describing nuclear receptor (NR) activation (i.e. the mouse-trap model) is founded on the comparison of apo- and holo-NR x-ray crystal structures. The mouse trap model posits that closure of the NR activation helix (i.e. helix-12) is induced by ligand binding to an opened-like helix-12 apo-NR conformer. The closed helix-12 conformation completes the activation function II domain (AF2), which serves as the high affinity binding site for recruitment of various NCoAs (1.Sutton A.L. MacDonald P.N. Mol.

The ZK side-chain molecular volume is significantly enhanced relative to 1,25D; therefore, ZK acts as a traditional NR antagonist by blocking VDR helix-12 closure (5.Tocchini-Valentini G. Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Moras D. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain MK antagonism; both are based on the inability of MK to function as an antagonist in the rodent VDR (rVDR). One current hypothesis suggests that the α/β-unsaturated exo-cyclic methylene of MK (Fig. 1) undergoes a 1,4-Michael addition (i.e. formation of a covalent MK-VDR adduct) with Cys-403 and/or Cys-410 of the human VDR (hVDR), neither of which are present in the rVDR primary sequence (10.Ochiai E.

Yet another hypothesis proposes that the energetic stability of the rVDR closed helix-12 conformer is enhanced relative to hVDR (7.Peräkylä M. Molnár F. Carlberg C. Chem.

Our comprehensive structure-function studies demonstrate that MK antagonism hinges on its reduced side-chain molecular volume allowing it to bind favorably to two distinct regions within the hVDRwt LBP. Furthermore, we show for the first time in the NR field that a known antagonist (MK) can be converted into a superagonist ligand by a conservative single point mutation and provide further evidence in support of the VDR ensemble model (18.Norman A.W.

The molecular volume of 1,25D, MK, and ZK was determined using Discovery Studio 2.0 (Molecular Attributes, Accelrys Inc.) and atom typing with the cff forcefield. For 1,25D and ZK the conformation used for the calculation was taken from the pose observed in their reported VDR LBD x-ray .pdb files. For MK the lowest energy complex determined using the flexible docking protocol (see below) was used to calculate the molecular volume. The molecular volumes of the hVDRwt ligand binding pocket (LBP) and the His-305, His-397, Leu-404, Leu-414, and Val-418 mutants were calculated following mutant generation and side-chain refinement in DS2.0. Following refinement the Receptor-Ligand Interaction/Binding Site/Find Sites from Receptor Cavities tool in DS2.0 was used to determine the molecular volume of the LBP. Cells were seeded at 0.4 × 105 cells per well on 24-well plates (BD Biosciences) in minimal Eagle medium with Earle's buffered salts and non-essential amino acids, with 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA). After 24-h incubation, phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells, at ∼60% confluence, were transfected using a 10-min pre-treatment with 0.2 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Pre-treated cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 μg/well activator pcDNA3.1(−)Nhe1(−)VDR or mutant plasmid and 0.5 μg/well reporter OC-pSEAP2 (secreted alkaline phosphatase) (22.Bula C.M. Huhtakangas J. Olivera C. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. Henry H.L. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5581-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated in 80 μm chloroquine in growth media with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for 4 h followed by the same culture medium without chloroquine for 24 h. At 28 h post transfection, the cell medium was replaced with the same medium containing various concentrations of 1,25D or its analogs, with a final ethanol concentration of 0.1%. In all antagonism studies first the 1,25D EC50 in the given VDR construct was experimentally derived (n ≥ 3), then a 10-fold excess of MK was co-incubated with the EC50 concentration of 1,25D (see supplemental materials). At 22 h after analog treatment, an aliquot of the cell medium was harvested to measure secreted alkaline phosphatase using the Phospha-LightTM Kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The concentration of steroid producing 50% (EC50) of the maximal activity was then determined using Prism v5.0. [35S]-VDR was generated from pcDNA3.1(−)Nhe1(−)VDR or mutant VDR plasmid constructs using the Promega TNT reticulocyte lysate kit. The reaction tubes were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C then placed on ice. 1,25D or analog was added, and the tubes were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 15 μg/ml trypsin was added to the tubes and incubated for 20 min at room temperature followed by 5.0-min incubation at 80 °C with SDS. Reaction mixtures were then loaded in a 12.5% or 15% SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to electrophoresis. Bands were visualized by autoradiography. The molecular weight of each band was calculated using Stratagene EagleSight software (v3.0.001). BL21-DE3 cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the pET15b vector containing human VDR LBD (aa 118–427; Δ165–215) obtained from the Moras laboratory (Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology, Strasbourg, France). Following culture scale-up to 1 liter (37 °C), cells were grown to an A600 of 0.5–0.6 (37 °C and 250 rpm), induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, grown at 20 °C for 6 h, and pelleted at 4,000 × g for 10 min (4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 10% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed by sonication (15-s pulse, 1 min on ice, repeated 3×). After centrifugation (12,000 × g), the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filters (Millipore), flash frozen, and stored at −80 °C. To determine the affinity of ligands for the hVDR, 0.05 pmol of [3H]1,25D in EtOH was added to borosilicate glass tubes (Fisher). Increasing concentrations of cold ligands were added to the tubes in duplicate, and total EtOH was adjusted to 20 μl. 230 μl (25 μg of total protein, determined by Bradford) of the diluted, clarified VDR-LBD was added to each tube, briefly vortexed, and placed at 4 °C for 4–24 h (buffer same as lysis buffer minus protease inhibitor cocktail and pH 8.0). Following incubation, 250 μl of 50% (v/v) hydroxyapatite solution in TED (10 mm Tris-base, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added and washed three times with 1 ml of TED plus 0.5% Triton X-100. Bound [3H]1,25D was eluted with 1 ml of ethanol and counted in 7 ml of Liquiscint (National Diagnostics) scintillation mixture using a Beckman LS6500. Data from duplicate samples were averaged and plotted as % max bound [3H]1,25D versus the log of the concentration of the competitor used. Non-linear regression using Prism® (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was performed to determine the IC50, correlation coefficient, and R2 values. Data were also plotted to generate a relative competitive index value (21.Mizwicki M.T. Keidel D. Bula C.M. Bishop J.E. Zanello L.P. Wurtz J.M. Moras D. Norman A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12876-12881Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Whole molecule GMMX (Global-MMX) experiments were carried out on 1,25D and MK allowing for flexibility in the A-ring, seco-B-ring, and side-chain single bonds of both molecules (Fig. 1). The following GMMX variables were used: search on bonds only, π-correction turned on, energy window of 11.0 kcal/mol, and 1000 total conformers generated. After the manual check of the sp2-hybridized atoms, the 1,25D and MK conformer sets were typed with the cff forcefield (DS2.0) and used for the flexible docking simulation. The complex formation between the apo-hVDR molecules and the PC_Model ligand conformers was simulated by applying a flexible docking protocol (DS2.0). To simulate the 1,25D and MK complex formation with the hVDRwt LBP and its mutants, 50 hVDR LBP conformations were first generated (this includes the hVDRwt LBD). Flexibility was allowed in the following R-groups: Tyr-143, Tyr-147, Asp-149, Phe-150, Phe-153, Leu-227, Ala-231, Leu-233, Val-234, Tyr-236, Ser-237, Ile-268, Met-272, Arg-274, Ser-275, Ser-278, Trp-286, Cys-288, Tyr-295, Asp-299, Val-300, Ala-303, Gly-304, His-305, Leu-309, Ile-310, Leu-313, His-397, Tyr-401, Leu-404, Leu-414, Thr-415, Val-418, and Phe-422 (i.e. the flexible docking residues, these residues form the VDR LBP). In all of the calculations the VDR conformational isomers were generated and the protocol stopped, so that the same set of VDR LBP conformers was sourced in all the simulations. The flexible docking protocol variables changed from the default parameters were as follows: a 10.0-Å docking sphere was defined by searching the apo-VDR molecule for putative binding sites; the number of flexible docking residues allowed for structural refinement was set to 12; the top 5 hits were saved for each protein-ligand pair, and a simulated annealing step was performed. The Generalized Born with Molecular Volume method (23.Im W. Lee M.S. Brooks 3rd, C.L. J. Comput. Chem. 2003; 24: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 24.Zoete V. Meuwly M. Karplus M. Proteins. 2005; 61: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was used to determine the ΔGbinding value (ΔGbinding = ΔGholo-VDR − ΔGapo-VDR − ΔGligand), where the only default values changed were the cutoff distances, which were changed from 14, 12, and 10 Å, to 10, 8, and 6 Å, respectively. For a more detailed description of the computational techniques/protocols employed herein see the supplemental materials. Based on the hVDR x-ray crystallographic results (5.Tocchini-Valentini G.

Chem. 2001; 9: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). These H-bonds effectively anchor the terminal methyl groups (Cys-26 and Cys-27 (Fig. 2)) of the 1,25D side chain to form favorable hydrophobic van der Waals (vdW) interactions with Leu-227 (helix-3), Leu-414 (helix-12), and Val-418 (helix-12 (Fig. 2)). The hydrophobic interactions made with theses three residues aid in stabilizing the intramolecular interaction between helix-3 and helix-12 and thereby the closed conformation of helix-12 (i.e. the activation helix (Fig. 2)). To study the impact that expanding or shrinking the free molecular volume of the VDR LBP proximal to the helix-3/helix-12 interface (Fig. 2) has on 1,25D-hVDR transactivation, we generated seven conservative hVDR point mutants. These were used to determine the 1,25D effective concentration (EC50) required to induce the expression of an osteocalcin-driven SEAP reporter, in CV1 cells (Table 1). The transactivation results demonstrated that all of the hVDR mutant constructs that increase the free molecular volume proximal to the helix-3/helix-12 interface suppressed 1,25D transactivation. In contrast, mutations made that reduced the free molecular volume, had little or no effect on the 1,25D EC50 (Table 1).TABLE 1The molecular volume of Leu-404, Leu-414, and Val-418 hVDR LBP mutants and 1,25Ds effective concentration (EC50)ConstructLBP molecular volume1,25D EC50Å3nmhVDRwt4061.4 ± 0.15 (n = 20)L404V43137 ± 1.6 (n = 3)L414V43428 ± 4.3 (n = 3)V418A41674 ± 24 (n = 3)V418L3991.8 ± 0.81 (n = 3)L404V/V418L424390 ± 150 (n = 3)L404V/L414V44869 ± 17 (n = 3)L404F/V418L4066.5 ± 1.5 (n = 3) Open table in a new tab Co-incubation of 10 nm MK with 1 nm 1,25D significantly hindered the ability of 1,25D to act as a potent genomic agonist in CV1 cells transiently transfected with hVDRwt (Fig. 3). When a 10-fold excess of MK was combined with an EC50 dose of 1,25D in the helix-3/helix-12 interface mutants (Table 1), MK antagonist potency was significantly enhanced by all of the hVDR mutants that increased the free molecular volume of the hVDR LBP (Figs. 2 and 3). These results were somewhat expected given MK had a reduced side-chain molecular volume (344 Å3) when compared with 1,25D (360 Å3 (Fig. 1)). Located opposite the helix-3/helix-12 interface in the hVDR LBP are the basic His-305 and His-397 residues (Fig. 2). To study the effect that expanding or shrinking the hVDR LBP molecular volume at the 305 and 397 loci has on 1,25D agonist potential, H305F, H305A, H397F, H305A/H397F, and H305F/H397F mutants were assayed. Of these mutants, the H305A, H397F, and H305A/H397F modifications increased the free volume of the LBP and had a weakened ability to respond to 1,25D (Table 2). However, only the H305A and H305A/H397F mutants were nearly as effective in attenuating 1,25D-induced transactivation when compared with the helix-3/helix-12 interface mutants (compare Tables 1 and 2).TABLE 2VDR LBP molecular volume, 1,25D/MK EC50 values, and VDR affinity in the His-305 and/or His-397 point mutantsConstructLBP molecular volume1,25D EC50MK EC50MK relative competitive index1,25D IC50MK IC50Å3nmnmnmnmxhVDRwt4061.4 ± 0.15 (n = 20)>500 (n = 6)10.6 ± 5.3 (n = 6)5.21 ± 2.79 (n = 4)37.9 ± 8.14 (n = 4)H305F3923.2 ± 0.93 (n = 3)0.062 ± 0.001 (n = 3)26.1 ± 23.2 (n = 4)17.0 ± 2.74 (n = 4)15.8 ± 9.63 (n = 4)H397F4219.1 ± 1.3 (n = 6)∼100 (n = 2)NDNDNDH305A46125.0 ± 2.9 (n = 6)NDNDNDNDH305A/H397F46031.0 ± 10.0 (n = 7)>500 (n = 3)NDNDNDH305F/H397F3651.6 ± 0.13 (n = 4)0.054 ± 0.035 (n = 3)227 ± 136 (n = 4)85.4 ± 36.9 (n = 4)73.5 ± 12.0 (n = 4) Open table in a new tab In contrast, the H305F and H305F/H397F mutations reduced the free volume of the hVDR LBP and showed an hVDRwt-like response to 1,25D (Table 2). This functional result correlated well with the measured affinity of 1,25D in H305F, but not H305F/H397F, where the ability of 1,25D to bind the H305F/H397F was weakened by ∼15-fold (Table 2). When the H305A and H305A/H397F mutants were co-incubated with an EC50 dose of 1,25D and a 10-fold excess of MK, MK functioned as a complete antagonist (≤5% of the 1,25D-reporter activity (Fig. 4, A–C). MK also functioned as a complete antagonist in the R402E hVDR construct, which has been previously shown to intrinsically reduce the stability of the closed hVDR helix-12 conformation (20.Mizwicki M.T. Bula C.M. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 103: 243-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). The only mutant that increased the free molecular volume of the hVDR LBP that did not adhere to the enhanced antagonistic trend of MK was H397F (Fig. 4E). Surprisingly, MK antagonism was lost in the H305F and H305F/H397F hVDR mutant constructs (Fig. 4, F and G, respectively). In fact, MK was a 29- and 33-fold more efficient agonist than 1,25D and therefore showed a superagonist response in these mutants (Table 2, 4th column). MK's efficacy (i.e. EC50) with H305F and H305F/H397F were the same; however, the agonist potency of 10 nm MK was approximately five orders of magnitude better in the H305F/H397F construct (Fig. 4G). These results indicate that reducing the free molecular volume of the hVDR LBP provides a physicochemical environment capable of overcoming the reduced molecular volume of the MK side chain (Fig. 1). Given that the MK side chain has more π-bond character when compared with 1,25D, we tested if the switch of MK into a superagonist was due to the H305F modification increasing MK's VDR affinity. The measured MK-VDR affinity (i.e. IC50) in H305F and H305F/H397F indicated that it was only slightly better in the H305F construct and worse in the H305F/H397F construct when compared with the MK·hVDRwt affinity (Table 2). Thus the measured MK-H305F/H397F EC50 and IC50 values do not correlate, an observation that was also true for 1,25D (Table 2). Because a correlation between affinity and function did not exist, we next determined if MK is capable of stabilizing the transcriptionally active, closed helix-12 conformation in H305F and H305F/H397F by performing partial trypsin digest (i.e. PSA) experiments. Three major hVDR fragments were generated by PSA. The ∼34-kDa hVDRwt fragment stabilized by 1,25D represents the active, closed conformation of helix-12 (hVDR-c1, Fig. 5A) (20.Mizwicki M.T. Bula C.M. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 103: 243-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30.Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The MK-H305F and MK-H305F/H397F PSA results demonstrated that MK did stabilize a strong hVDR-c1 band (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, the hVDR-c1 band was observed at very low doses of MK only in the H305F/H397F construct (Fig. 5, compare A and B). The hVDR-c1 band was also observed at low doses of 1,25D (Fig. 5C) indicating that the enhanced stability of the hVDR-c1 conformer stems from a favorable intramolecular effect introduced by the H305F/H397F double mutation. This was confirmed by a significant enhancement in the protection of the apo-H305F/H397F construct against proteolytic degradation when compared with apo-hVDRwt (Fig. 5D). Consistent with the proposal that the MK molecule can form a covalent adduct with the hVDR LBP (10.Ochiai E. Miura D. Eguchi H. Ohara S. Takenouchi K. Azuma Y. Kamimura T. Norman A.W. Ishizuka S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the MK·hVDRwt PSA dose experiment demonstrated that the c1, c2, and c3 can be covalently modified by MK in a dose-dependent manner (see white arrows, Fig. 6). The covalent adducts were not observed in any of the His-305 or His-397 point mutations, as determined by PSA (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 4), suggesting that either His residue is capable of forming an MK covalent adduct. To test the validity of this hypothesis and to gain a more precise structural/molecular understanding for the switch of MK into a superagonist/complete antagonist and its known species specificity (7.Peräkylä M. Molnár F. Carlberg C. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10.Ochiai E. Miura D. Eguchi H. Ohara S. Takenouchi K. Azuma Y. Kamimura T. Norman A.W. Ishizuka S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we developed a flexible docking molecular modeling protocol. To simulate the binding and stability of flexible vitamin D sterols to a flexible hVDR LBP we combined two techniques. Whole molecule PC_Model GMMX conformational search calculations were employed to generate conformational isomers of 1,25D and MK. For 1,25D this computation produced 502 conformational isomers and for MK 133, consistent with the reduction in the rotational degrees of freedom of the MK side chain (Fig. 1). The conformational isomers were then docked to different hVDR LBP conformers using the flexible docking protocol of Discovery Studio 2.0 (DS2.0, see “Experimental Procedures”). Using this approach, the 1,25D conformational isomer observed in the x-ray structure was selected as the most energetically favored ligand pose in the flexible hVDR LBP (Fig. 7A). The ΔGbinding value calculated for the energy optimized 1,25D-hVDR x-ray complex was −47.1 kcal/mole, whereas the complex predicted by the flexible docking protocol was −50.7 kcal/mole (Table 3), indicating a minor refinement to the x-ray complex. Furthermore, the 1,25D ΔGbinding values calculated for H305F, H305F/H397F, H397F, and H305A qualitatively correlated with the measured 1,25D EC50 values in these mutants (Table 2).TABLE 31,25D and MK flexible docking resultshVDR constructAvg. 1,25D ΔGbindinghVDR constructMK region 1:"

https://openalex.org/W2088741298,"Although terminal differentiation of intestinal epithelium is essential for the efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Recent studies have shown that Elf3 (E74-like factor 3), a member of the ETS transcription factor family, has an essential role in the terminal differentiation of absorptive enterocytes and mucus-secreting goblet cells. Here, we demonstrated that Crif1 (CR6-interacting factor 1) functions as transcriptional coactivator of Elf3 in intestinal epithelium differentiation. The intestinal epithelium-specific Crif1-deficient mice died soon after birth and displayed severe alterations of tissue architecture in the small intestine, including poor microvillus formation and abnormal differentiation of absorptive enterocytes. Strikingly, these phenotypes are largely similar to that of Elf3-deficient mice, suggesting that Elf3 signaling in the intestinal epithelium depends on the Crif1 expression. We dissected this relationship further and found that Crif1 indeed interacted with Elf3 through its ETS DNA binding domain and enhanced the transcriptional activity of Elf3 by regulating the DNA binding activity. Knockdown of Crif1 by RNA interference conversely attenuated the transcriptional activity of Elf3. Consistently, the expression level of Tgf-betaRII (transforming growth factor beta type II receptor), a critical target gene of Elf3, was dramatically reduced in the Crif1-deficient mice. Our results reveal that Crif1 is a novel and essential transcriptional coactivator of Elf3 for the terminal differentiation of absorptive enterocytes."

Progress in understanding the structure and function of PDE6 has been hindered by lack of an expression system of the enzyme. Here we report ectopic expression and analysis of compartmentalization and membrane dynamics of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion protein of human cone PDE6C in rods of transgenic Xenopus laevis. EGFP-PDE6C is correctly targeted to the rod outer segments in transgenic Xenopus, where it displayed a characteristic striated pattern of EGFP fluorescence. Immunofluorescence labeling indicated significant and light-independent co-localization of EGFP-PDE6C with the disc rim marker peripherin-2 and endogenous frog PDE6. The diffusion of EGFP-PDE6C on disc membranes investigated with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was markedly slower than theoretically predicted. The enzymatic characteristics of immunoprecipitated recombinant PDE6C were similar to known properties of the native bovine PDE6C. PDE6C was potently inhibited by the cone- and rod-specific PDE6 gamma-subunits. Thus, transgenic Xenopus laevis is a unique expression system for PDE6 well suited for analysis of the mechanisms of visual diseases linked to PDE6 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2014703687,"It is well known that phosphoglucose isomerase/autocrine motility factor (AMF) promotes cell migration in an autocrine manner in various tumor cells. However, it remains unclear whether certain cytokines modulate the effects of AMF on tumor cell migration. Because interleukin (IL)-8, a proinflammatory cytokine, is produced by melanoma cells and has been correlated with melanoma migration, the migratory ability of melanoma cells induced by AMF may also involve induction of IL-8 expression. In the present study, we assessed whether AMF promotes melanoma cell migration through autocrine production of IL-8. We found that AMF stimulation increased IL-8 production through up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA transcription, especially in biologically early stage melanoma cells. AMF-induced migration of these cells was inhibited by a specific neutralizing antibody against IL-8. The IL-8 production induced by AMF was mediated by the ERK1/2 pathways. These findings suggest that melanoma migration induced by AMF is mediated by autocrine production of IL-8 as a novel downstream modulator of the AMF signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2050497595,"Here, we report a novel role for hGas7b (human growth arrest specific protein 7b) in the regulation of microtubules. Using a bioinformatic approach, we studied the actin-binding protein hGas7b with a structural similarity to the WW domain of a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase, Pin1, that facilitates microtubule assembly. Thus, we have demonstrated that hGas7b binds Tau at the WW motif and that the hGas7b/Tau protein complex interacts with the microtubules, promoting tubulin polymerization. Tau, in turn, contributes to protein stability of hGas7b. Furthermore, we observed decreased levels of hGas7b in the brains from patients with Alzheimer disease. These results suggest an important role for hGas7b in microtubular maintenance and possible implication in Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2166598337,"Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) terminates the endocannabinoid signaling pathway that regulates numerous neurobehavioral processes in animals by hydrolyzing N-acylethanolamines (NAEs). Recently, an Arabidopsis FAAH homologue (AtFAAH) was identified, and several studies, especially those using AtFAAH overexpressing and knock-out lines, have suggested an in vivo role for FAAH in the catabolism of NAEs in plants. We previously reported that overexpression of AtFAAH in Arabidopsis resulted in accelerated seedling growth, and in seedlings that were insensitive to exogenous NAEs but hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) and hypersusceptible to nonhost pathogens. Here we show that whereas the enhanced growth and NAE tolerance of the AtFAAH overexpressing seedlings depend on the catalytic activity of AtFAAH, hypersensitivity to ABA and hypersusceptibility to nonhost pathogens are independent of its enzymatic activity. Five amino acids known to be critical for rat FAAH activity are also conserved in AtFAAH (Lys-205, Ser-281, Ser-282, Ser-305, and Arg-307). Site-directed mutation of each of these conserved residues in AtFAAH abolished its hydrolytic activity when expressed in Escherichia coli, supporting a common catalytic mechanism in animal and plant FAAH enzymes. Overexpression of these inactive AtFAAH mutants in Arabidopsis showed no growth enhancement and no NAE tolerance, but still rendered the seedlings hypersensitive to ABA and hypersusceptible to nonhost pathogens to a degree similar to the overexpression of the native AtFAAH. Taken together, our findings suggest that the AtFAAH influences plant growth and interacts with ABA signaling and plant defense through distinctly different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1965014575,"The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) sugar phosphotransferase system mediates sugar uptake and controls the carbon metabolism in response to carbohydrate availability. Enzyme I (EI), the first component of the phosphotransferase system, consists of an N-terminal protein binding domain (EIN) and a C-terminal PEP binding domain (EIC). EI transfers phosphate from PEP by double displacement via a histidine residue on EIN to the general phosphoryl carrier protein HPr. Here we report the 2.4 A crystal structure of the homodimeric EI from Staphylococcus aureus. EIN consists of the helical hairpin HPr binding subdomain and the phosphorylatable betaalpha phospho-histidine (P-His) domain. EIC folds into an (betaalpha)(8) barrel. The dimer interface of EIC buries 1833 A(2) of accessible surface per monomer and contains two Ca(2+) binding sites per dimer. The structures of the S. aureus and Escherichia coli EI domains (Teplyakov, A., Lim, K., Zhu, P. P., Kapadia, G., Chen, C. C., Schwartz, J., Howard, A., Reddy, P. T., Peterkofsky, A., and Herzberg, O. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 16218-16223) are very similar. The orientation of the domains relative to each other, however, is different. In the present structure the P-His domain is docked to the HPr binding domain in an orientation appropriate for in-line transfer of the phosphate to the active site histidine of the acceptor HPr. In the E. coli structure the phospho-His of the P-His domain projects into the PEP binding site of EIC. In the S. aureus structure the crystallographic temperature factors are lower for the HPr binding domain in contact with the P-His domain and higher for EIC. In the E. coli structure it is the reverse."

https://openalex.org/W2071221231,"Interleukin 4 (IL-4) inhibits receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation and functional activity in a STAT6-dependent manner. IL-4 down-regulates expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in mature osteoclasts. To determine whether IL-4 regulates TRAP promoter activity, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with a TRAP promoter-luciferase reporter. Treatment with IL-4 alone modestly enhanced TRAP luciferase activity. However, IL-4 suppressed the ability of RANKL to up-regulate TRAP-luciferase activity, suggesting that IL-4 has multiple effects on TRAP transcription. IL-4 also reduced the RANKL-induced association of RNA polymerase II with the TRAP gene in osteoclasts. The TRAP promoter contains a STAT6-binding motif, and STAT6 bound to the endogenous TRAP promoter after IL-4 treatment. To determine the impact of STAT6 binding, we transfected cells with STAT6VT, a constitutively active STAT6 mutant. STAT6VT alone up-regulated TRAP-luciferase activity; this effect was abrogated by mutating the STAT6 binding site in the minimal TRAP promoter. STAT6VT did not inhibit the potent up-regulation of TRAP promoter activity caused by overexpression of NFATc1, PU.1, and microphthalmia transcription factor, downstream targets of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and RANKL. IL-4 down-regulated the expression of c-Fos and NFATc1 in mature osteoclasts. Knockdown of NFATc1 by short interfering RNA caused TRAP expression to be down-regulated, and ectopic expression of NFATc1 abrogated the IL-4-induced down-regulation of TRAP. These results suggest that STAT6 plays two distinct roles in TRAP expression. The IL-4-induced activation of STAT6 mediates suppression of the RANKL-induced TRAP promoter activity indirectly by inhibiting NFATc1 expression. However, in the absence of RANKL and osteoclast differentiation, STAT6 binds the TRAP promoter after IL-4 treatment and directly enhances TRAP expression."
https://openalex.org/W2051842310,"Mutations in the homeobox transcription factor PITX2 result in Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS), which is associated with anterior segment dysgenesis and an increased risk of glaucoma. To understand the pathogenesis of the defects resulting from PITX2 mutations, it is essential to know the normal functions of PITX2 and its interaction with the network of proteins in the eye. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using a cDNA library from a human trabecular meshwork primary cell line to detect novel PITX2-interacting proteins and study their role in ARS pathogenesis. After screening of approximately 1 x 10(6) clones, one putative interacting protein was identified named PRKC apoptosis WT1 regulator (PAWR). This interaction was further confirmed by retransformation assay in yeast cells as well as co-immunoprecipitation in ocular cells and nickel pulldown assay in vitro. PAWR is reportedly a proapoptotic protein capable of selectively inducing apoptosis primarily in cancer cells. Our analysis indicates that the homeodomain and the adjacent inhibitory domain in PITX2 interact with the C-terminal leucine zipper domain of PAWR. Endogenous PAWR and PITX2 were found to be located in the nucleus of ocular cells and to co-localize in the mesenchyme of the iridocorneal angle of the developing mouse eye, consistent with a role in the development of the anterior segment of the eye. PAWR was also found to inhibit PITX2 transcriptional activity in ocular cells. These data suggest PAWR is a novel PITX2-interacting protein that regulates PITX2 activity in ocular cells. This information sheds new light in understanding ARS and associated glaucoma pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2124886000,"Abnormalities in the transport of saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA; >C18:0) contribute to their toxic levels in peroxisomal disorders of fatty acid metabolism, such as adrenoleukodystrophy and adrenomyeloneuropathy. We previously showed that VLCFA desorb much slower than normal dietary fatty acids from both albumin and protein-free lipid bilayers. The important step of transbilayer movement (flip-flop) was not measured directly as a consequence of this very slow desorption from donors, and the extremely low aqueous solubility of VLCFA precludes addition of unbound VLCFA to lipid membranes. We have overcome these limitations using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin to solubilize VLCFA for rapid delivery to ""acceptor"" phosphatidylcholine vesicles (small and large unilamellar) and to cells. VLCFA binding was monitored in real time with the fluorescent probe fluorescein-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine in the outer membrane leaflet, and entrapped pyranine was used to detect flip-flop across the membrane. The upper limit of the rate of flip-flop across the membrane was independent of temperature and media viscosity and was similar for model raft and non-raft membranes as well as living cells. We further showed that cyclodextrins can extract VLCFA rapidly (within seconds) from vesicles and cells, which have implications for the mechanism and potential alternative approaches to treat adrenoleukodystrophy. Because VLCFA diffuse through the lipid bilayer, proteins may not be required for their transport across the peroxisomal membrane."

Although a disulfide-constrained peptide exhibited strong inhibition, a linear peptide with the same sequence, or a disulfide-constrained variant with a single lysine to alanine mutation showed significantly reduced capabilities of inhibition. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the 170 loop of the β-domain of streptokinase was then performed to elucidate its importance in streptokinase-mediated plasminogen activation.

Remarkably, these mutants were able to generate amidolytic activity and non-proteolytic activation in “partner” plasminogen as wild-type streptokinase. Moreover, cofactor activities of the 170 loop mutants, pre-complexed with plasmin, against microplasminogen as the substrate showed a similar pattern of decline in kcat as that observed in the case of full-length plasminogen, with no concomitant change in Km.

Elegant equilibrium binding and kinetic studies directed toward resolving the steps involved in the phenomenon of conformational activation of HPG by SK demonstrate a relatively rapid formation of a SK·HPG* complex, a “conformationally activated” state, due to the generation of a nonproteolytically activated active center, which is also amidolytically active (4.Boxrud P.D.

One of the fascinating aspects of HPG activation reaction is the molecular mechanisms whereby the binding of SK to HPN modulates the substrate specificity of the latter (with, essentially, a trypsin-like broad specificity), virtually re-programming it to a very high degree of preference for the Arg561-Val562, the scissile peptide bond of substrate HPG that leads to the HPG proteolytic activation (5.Boxrud P.D.

The crystal structure of SK complexed with μPN (the isolated catalytic domain of HPN), with which SK forms a tight binary complex as it does with full-length HPG, reveals that the domains of SK form a “three-sided crater,” with the μPN situated at the bottom of a valley into which the substrate's catalytic domain, bearing the “target” scissile peptide bond to be cleaved, can potentially dock (9.Wang X.

However, its overall contribution toward plasminogen activation cannot be described as major, because its mutation was found to abolish only a relatively small fraction of the overall activity of SK·HPN against HPG and μPG.

The results, presented below, reveal that this loop contributes in a major way toward catalytic processing of the substrate plasminogen, because various point-mutations within this loop resulted in more than an order of drop in kcat even though substrate affinity of the mutants, as well as their capability to engender the non-proteolytic activation in partner plasminogen, as tested through the activation of scissile-peptide bond mutant of microplasminogen (μPG R561A) remains unaltered. Thus, the present study identifies a new exosite in SK that is important in the activation of HPG. Glu-plasminogen was either purchased from Roche Diagnostics GmBH, Germany, or purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography (17.Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). The T7 RNA polymerase-promoter-based expression vector, pET 23(d), and Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) were products of Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). Thermostable DNA polymerase (pfu TurboTM) was obtained from Stratagene Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide primers were supplied by Biobasic Inc., Canada. Phenyl-agarose 6XL was procured from Prometic Biosciences Ltd., UK, and DEAE-Sepharose (fast-flow) from Amersham Biosciences. Urokinase, ϵ-aminocaproic acid, sodium cyanoborohydride, and l-lysine were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents used were of the highest analytical grade available. Custom synthesis of the peptides derived from the 170 loop primary structure, namely CQFTPLNPDDDFRPGLKDTKLLC, or its mutated sequence, namely CQFTPLNPDDDFRPGLADTKLLC, was carried out using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-based solid-phase peptide chemistry on an automated peptide synthesizer model PS3 by M/s USV, Mumbai, India. After synthesis and cleavage by standard procedures, the peptides were purified on reverse transcription-high-performance liquid chromatography and disulfide-constrained peptide, were cyclized by H2O2 treatment. Linear peptides were N-terminally acetylated and their C-terminal amidated. The SK gene from Streptococcus equisimilis H46A strain, a type C streptococcus, was earlier cloned in pET 23d vector (11.Chaudhary A. Vasudha S. Rajagopal K. Komath S.S. Garg N. Yadav M. Mande S.C. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2791-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and this construct was used to prepare all substitution mutants. The substitution point-mutations of the 170 loop of the β-domain of SK were prepared by using a QuikChange® mutagenesis kit obtained from Stratagene Inc., which involves usage of two complementary primers having the desired mutation at the center (see supplemental Table SI for a list of the primers designed for the various mutants). The wtSK and 170 loop mutants cloned in pET 23d were expressed intracellularly in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as inclusion bodies under the control of the T7 phage RNA polymerase promoter after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and purified as described (11.Chaudhary A. Vasudha S. Rajagopal K. Komath S.S. Garg N. Yadav M. Mande S.C. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2791-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Plasmin (HPN), the active form of HPG, was prepared by digesting Glu-HPG with urokinase covalently immobilized on agarose beads using a ratio of 300 Plough units/mg HPG in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, and 25 mm l-lysine at 22 °C for 10 h (11.Chaudhary A.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2791-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). μPG, the catalytic domain of plasminogen (residues Lys530–Asn790) made devoid of all five kringles, was prepared by cleavage of HPG by HPN under alkaline conditions (0.1 n glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 10.5) at 25 °C (18.Shi G.Y. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17071-17075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant μPG and its scissile peptide-bond mutant, R561A, were expressed and purified as described earlier (19.Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The SK·HPN activator complex was formed by preincubating equimolar concentrations (0.5 μm each) of SK and HPN in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 22 °C for 1 min (20.Radek J.T. Davidson D.J. Castellino F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This enzyme complex, at a final concentration of 5 nm, was added to reaction mixes already containing various concentrations of individual peptides (0–500 μm) in assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl preincubated with 0.05 μm of HPG for 10 min. The generation of plasminogen activator activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm by recording the increase in rate of release of p-nitroanilide from the chromogenic substrate by the human plasmin generated as a result of HPG activation for a period of 10 min at 22 °C. A control reaction contained all components except the test peptide. The specific activity at each concentration of inhibitory peptide was calculated by obtaining the slopes of the activation progress curves as change in absorbance/t2. The extent of inhibition by different concentrations of the given peptide was determined and expressed in percentage relative to control reactions (taken as 100%) conducted in the absence of peptide. A one-stage colorimetric assay method, was used to measure the kinetics of HPG activation by wtSK or its mutants (21.Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change in absorbance at 405 nm was then measured as a function of time (t) in a Molecular Devices Versamax microplate reader at 22 °C. The activator activities were obtained from the slopes of the activation progress curves as change in absorbance/t2 (21.Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal methionine was removed from wtSK and 170 loop mutants using methionine aminopeptidase (pfu MetAP) enzyme by a procedure, as described previously (22.Wakeham N. Terzyan S. Zhai P. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The extent of removal of the N-terminal methionine was determined by N-terminal sequence analysis on Applied Biosystems sequencer, Model 491A, and also through quantitative amino acid composition analysis. To monitor the active site formation 7 μm HPG was added to an assay cuvette containing 7.5 μm wtSK/mutant, 100 μm NPGB, and 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The “burst” of p-nitrophenol release due to acylation of active center was monitored at 410 nm as a function of time at 22 °C (2.McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23.Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 24.Wohl R.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3799-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). R561A μPG mutant (final concentration, 5.0 μm) was incubated with 5.5 μm wtSK or a mutant SK, in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5. The time course of amidolytic activity generation was determined after transferring an aliquot of the complex to a 100-μl reaction well containing assay buffer, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl along with 1 mm Chromozym®PL (the transfer time (including initial complexation was ∼30 s). Final concentration of the complex in the amidolytic assay reaction was 10 nm. The change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored spectrophotometrically as a function of time (19.Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The kinetics of HPG/μPG activation by HPN·wtSK/SK-loop mutant complexes was measured by transferring suitable aliquots (usually, so as to attain a 0.5 nm final concentration in the assay mix) of preformed HPN·wtSK/SK loop mutant complexes to the reaction wells containing varying concentrations of substrate HPG/μPG in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl) also containing 0.5 mm chromogenic substrate Chromozym®PL. The generation of activator activity was monitored at 22 °C at 405 nm as before. The kinetic parameters for HPG/μPG activation were then calculated from Michaelis-Menten (v versus S) and inverse (1/v versus 1/S) Lineweaver-Burk plots (20.Radek J.T. Davidson D.J. Castellino F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor was also used to measure the rate and equilibrium dissociation constants describing interactions between soluble analytes (HPG and μPG) and wtSK/SK loop mutants complexed with immobilized HPG, a situation simulating substrate binding to binary complex and hereafter referred to as ternary interaction as described previously (14.Dhar J. Pande A.H. Sundram V. Nanda J.S. Mande S.C. Sahni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13257-13267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 25 °C in HBS “running buffer” (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5 mm NPGB. The NPGB was included to prevent plasmin-mediated proteolysis (14.Dhar J. Pande A.H. Sundram V. Nanda J.S. Mande S.C. Sahni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13257-13267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Figs. S4 and S5 for binding sensorgrams). After subtracting the nonspecific response the association rate constants (kon values), the dissociation rate constants (koff values) and the equilibrium binding constant (KD) were calculated from sensorgrams by non-linear fitting of the association and dissociation curves according to a 1:1 binding model, using BIACORE 3000 evaluation software. With the objective to explore the possible role of the 170 loop of SK in plasminogen activation, a set of peptides was synthesized corresponding to residues Pro165 to Leu185 (each containing 23 residues), including unconstrained, linear, and peptides constrained at the N and C termini through an intramolecular disulfide bond (25.Jackson K.W. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6620-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) after cysteine additions at both ends (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The synthetic peptides were then examined for their ability to selectively inhibit activation of sub-saturating concentrations of substrate HPG by the preformed wtSK·HPN enzyme complex. Such a peptide mimotope approach is closely similar to our earlier studies to map another important substrate-interacting site in SK (26.Nihalani D. Raghava G.P. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1284-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27.Nihalani D. Kumar R. Rajagopal K. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Remarkably, Peptide 2 (wild-type 170 loop sequence constrained through a disulfide bond) inhibited the activation of substrate HPG in a concentration-dependent manner in the low micromolar range of concentration, whereas the linear peptide, i.e. Peptide 1, could not inhibit substrate HPG activation significantly compared with uninhibited controls (see Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1 for actual progress curves showing direct inhibition by the constrained peptide). This observation indicated that the linear, 170 loop peptide probably remains in an extended conformation incapable of competing with SK·HPN for its substrate interactions, whereas the cyclic peptide adopts a conformation that mimics the 170 loop epitope in the native structure of SK. Apart from testing for inhibition of the preformed wtSK·HPN enzyme complex, the two peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit amidolytic activity of HPN, on the one hand, and also the amidolytic activity of SK·HPN complex, on the other. In both cases, no observable inhibition could be seen in the amidolytic activity of free HPN as well as wtSK·HPN complex, which suggests that this 170 loop peptide selectively interferes in the interaction of the activator enzyme with substrate HPG, and thereby competitively inhibits its activation. The sequence of residues 170–181 of SK, which comprises the 170 loop in the β-domain of this tri-domain protein, consists of a stretch containing several positively and negatively charged residues (16.Wang X. Tang J. Hunter B. Zhang X.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25.Jackson K.W. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6620-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To further explore the possible role of this loop in SK-mediated plasminogen activation, and also to identify its important residues if the loop were indeed important in HPG activation, alanine substitution mutations were introduced into the loop in the full-length SK expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as inclusion bodies and purified to near-homogeneity (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Far-UV CD spectra of the purified 170 loop mutants (data not shown) showed a close resemblance with that of the wtSK, which was suggestive of the absence of any major structural impairment caused by the loop mutations. The mutants were then characterized for their ability to activate HPG by a single-stage continuous spectrophotometric assay that measures the overall HPG activator activity using catalytic amounts of SK and a large excess of HPG (28.De Renzo E.C. Siiteri P.K. Hutchings B.L. Bell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 533-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative slopes of the progress curves so obtained (see Fig. 3, which shows the time course of plasmin generation by some of the alanine mutants compared with that of wtSK) clearly indicate that the alanine substitution mutants of 170 loop exhibited varied extents of reduction in their HPG activation capabilities. Of all the single-site substitution mutants tested, we observed that K180A exhibited the most compromised plasminogen activator activity, roughly of an order of magnitude less compared with wild-type SK. This was followed by P177A and R176A, carrying substitutions toward the central region of the loop. However, some mutants (D172A, D173A, and D174A) showed, at most, only a minor decrease in activity compared with wtSK. Because alanine substitution at position 180 in the full-length protein led to reduced plasminogen activation, it was of interest to perform direct inhibition assays with wtSK·HPN or mutant SK·HPN, as before, using the synthetic peptide approach. Using 170 loop wild-type peptide, both linear as well as cyclic, we checked for a possible inhibition of the mutant K180A·HPN enzyme complex, but none of these exhibited any significant inhibition at or near the concentrations seen to be inhibitory with wtSK·HPN (data not shown). This result suggests that the 170 loop sequence derived (wild-type) peptide, which likely mimics the specific conformation of the epitope present in the 170 loop of β-domain in streptokinase, loses its recognition (and, hence, capability for inhibition) once SK is mutated at the 180 position. To further explore the importance of this lysine to alanine substitution, linear as well as cyclic synthetic peptides, as before, carrying the alanine substitution at lysine 180 position were used to test for inhibition of wtSK·HPN enzyme complex in the HPG activation assays (Fig. 2; see also supplemental Fig. S1 for actual progress curves showing no inhibition by the mutated constrained peptide). From these results, it is apparent that the mutated constrained peptide had lost its ability for inhibition. Thus, overall, the results strongly support the conclusion that the 170 loop sequence represents a “hot spot” involved in substrate activation by SK·HPN. Because some of the single substitution mutants of the 170 loop exhibited significant reduction in their plasminogen activator capability, as monitored through single-stage assays, it was of interest to explore the underlying cause of this decline in activity, i.e. whether it was the amidolytic/zymogen activation step, which operates through Pathway I (schematically presented in Fig. 1) wherein 1:1 complexation of HPG with SK and formation of the SK·HPG* activator complex occurs, was affected, or a step subsequent to this, in Pathway II, namely the interaction of substrate HPG with the fully mature mutant SK·HPN complex. To address this issue, the ability of 170 loop mutants to generate the active site in HPG upon 1:1 complexation was examined through the well"
https://openalex.org/W2027630809,"We have previously identified integrin αvβ3 and Fas as receptors for the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B), and G308S, a mutant of SPE B that binds to Fas only. In the current study we found that after binding to αvβ3, SPE B stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT1. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by a JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, short interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of JAK2, and anti-αVβ3 antibody. AG490 also decreased the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 to the procaspase 8 promoter, decreasing procaspase 8 expression, suggesting that SPE B up-regulates procaspase 8 expression via the JAK2/STAT1 pathway. Alternatively, both SPE B and G308S increased STAT1 phosphorylation at serine 727, which was inhibited by anti-Fas antibody, a p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and siRNA silencing of p38. In addition, SPE B and G308S increased binding of serine-phosphorylated STAT1 to the Bax promoter and Bax expression, which was decreased by SB203580. SPE B and G308S-stimulated Bax expression was also inhibited by anti-Fas antibody. These findings suggest that Fas mediate SPE B-induced Bax expression through p38. Silencing of JAK2 or p38 by siRNA blocked procaspase 8 expression, whereas only p38 siRNA decreased Bax expression.

The time course analysis indicated that during apoptosis, molecules were activated in the following sequence: caspase 8, Bid, Bax, cytochrome c release, caspase 9, and caspase 3 (8.Tsai W.H.

Further analysis indicated that transcription of procaspase 8 and Bax were stimulated by SPE B. In the present study we further characterize the signal pathways that lead to the expression of procaspase 8 and Bax. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) protein family members are important for growth, development, proliferation, and cell death because they modulate the expression of target genes (9.Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation provides the binding site for the SH2 domain of STAT protein to form homo- or heterodimers. Dimer formation results in the translocation of STAT proteins to the nucleus, where they bind to target genes and modulate transcription. The COOH-terminal transactivation domains of some STAT proteins contain a conserved serine residue that can be phosphorylated to serve as a coactivator to modulate the function of other transcription factors independent of STAT binding to DNA (9.Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). As for cytokine-activated STATs, Janus kinases (JAKs) phosphorylate tyrosine residues, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) phosphorylate serine residues (10.Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin.

The three major MAPK pathways, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK, mediate phosphorylation on serine residues. ERKs are more important for the anti-apoptotic signal pathway, e.g. ERK inhibits Fas-induced tumor cell apoptosis (17.Holmström T.H. Tran S.E. Johnson V.L. Ahn N.G. Chow S.C. Eriksson J.E. Mol. Cell.

In the present study we further elucidate the roles of the STAT1 and MAPK pathways in the SPE B-induced apoptotic pathway. Our presented evidence indicates that (i) SPE B triggers the integrin αVβ3-mediated JAK2/STAT1 signal pathway to induce the expression of procaspase 8 and (ii) SPE B also binds to the Fas receptor to activate p38 MAPK that phosphorylates STAT1 at serine 727 and increases expression of Bax. The expression and purification of recombinant SPE B (rSPE B) have been previously described (5.Chen C.Y. Luo S.C. Kuo C.F. Lin Y.S. Wu J.J. Lin M.T. Liu C.C. Jeng W.Y. Chuang W.J. J. Biol.

The gene encoding ProSPE B was amplified using a PCR with six histidine tags and a BamH1 recognition site. The gene was then cloned into the BamH1 site of the pET21a vector (Novagen), which was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 pLys. A wild-type construct was used to produce a G308S mutant, a conversion of the RGD motif to RSD, using overlap extension PCR (21.Aiyar A. Xiang Y. Leis J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 177-191PubMed Google Scholar). An inoculum (250 μl) of stock culture was added to 250 ml of LB/AMP medium (Sigma) and allowed to grow to an optical density (590 nm) of 0.5–1.0. To induce rSPE B expression, 250 μl of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (100 mg/ml, MDBio) was added to the culture medium. For rSPE B, cells were grown at 33 °C overnight, whereas for G308S, cells were grown at 37 °C overnight. After induction, cells were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min, and the pellets were resuspended in 80 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris and 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). The resuspended pellet was broken three times using a French press at 1500 kg/cm2 for 30 s. The entire content was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to collect supernatant, which was then separated on a nickel-chelated column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted by a 0–200 mm imidazole gradient. The collected fractions were concentrated using Amicon ultrafiltration with a 10-kDa cutoff membrane (Millipore Corp.) and dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Purity was verified using SDS-PAGE. rSPE B and G308S were expressed as a 42-kDa zymogen and converted to a 28-kDa active enzyme during the course of purification. The purified rSPE B and G308S were passed through Detoxi-Gel (Pierce) to remove lipopolysaccharide contamination. A549 cells were grown in defined minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamate (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Cells (8 × 104/well) were seeded into a 24-well plate for 24 h and then washed with PBS and incubated in complete medium containing specified agents for the time indicated. Cells (2 × 105/well) were seeded into a 6-well plate for 24 h, washed with cold PBS, and then incubated with the indicated agents for the indicated times. The cells were collected and boiled in sample buffer for 5 min. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (BioTrace) and blocked with PBS containing 5% lowfat milk at 4 °C overnight. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were probed with one of the following primary antibodies diluted in PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) or TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20): 1/100 dilution of anti-procaspase 8 (Cell Signaling), 1/200 dilution of anti-caspase 8 (Cell Signaling), 1/500 dilution of anti-Bax (Oncogene), 1/500 dilution of anti-JAK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1/500 dilution of anti-STAT1 (Calbiochem), 1/500 dilution of anti-phosphotyrosine (Calbiochem), 1/100 dilution of phospho-specific (Thr180/Tyr182) anti-p38 MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1/500 dilution of anti-p38α MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1/200 dilution of anti-ERK1/2 (Calbiochem), 1/100 dilution of phospho-specific (Thr202/Tyr204) anti- ERK1/2 (Calbiochem), 1/100 dilution of anti-p-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1/500 dilution of anti-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1/100 dilution of phospho-specific (Tyr701) anti-STAT1 (Calbiochem), or 1/100 dilution of phospho-specific (Ser727) anti-STAT1 (Calbiochem). The membranes were washed 4 times with PBST or TBST and probed with 0.1 μg/ml of the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Bioscience). Protein loading was controlled using anti-β-actin (1/10,000) (Sigma) or anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen antibody (1/1000) (Calbiochem). Each experiment was independently repeated three times. In the immunoprecipitation assay, the cell lysates were preincubated with 2.5 μg of anti-JAK2 antibody at 4 °C overnight and then with protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 3 h. Protein A beads were washed 4 times with cold PBS, resuspended in Laemmli buffer (25 μl; 0.0625 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue), and boiled. Proteins were detected using Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, as described above. Total RNA was extracted from A549 cells, and 5 μg of total RNA was subjected to an oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcriptase reaction. cDNA was synthesized by a PCR. The primers used for procaspase 8 amplification were 5′-AGGAAAGTTGACATCCTGAAAA-3′ and 5′-GGAGAGTCCGAGATTGTCATTA-3′, which recognized fragments of α1 (127 bp) and α2 (173 bp), respectively. The conditions for PCR amplification of procaspase 8 were 95 °C for 5 min, then 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. The primers used for Bax amplification were 5′-ATCCAGGATCGAGCAGGGCG-3′ and 5′-ACTCGCTCAGCTTCTTGGTG-3′. The conditions for PCR amplification of Bax were 95 °C for 2 min, then 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. Before PCR amplification with each primer pair, an aliquot of the cDNA was amplified with β-actin primers to determine whether the equivalent amounts of RNA were prepared. All PCR products were separated on 2% (w/v) agarose gels. Cells were scraped from the culture dish and washed with cold PBS. Pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of cell lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm KCl), incubated on ice for 15 min, and then vortexed for 15 s. Whole contents were centrifuged at 15,000 × g at room temperature for 10 s. STAT1 in the supernatants was detected by Western blotting. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of cold nuclear lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 nm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5 mm MgCl2) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 s to remove the nuclear debris. Supernatants were used to detect STAT1 using Western blotting. The expression of short hairpin RNA is described elsewhere (8.Tsai W.H. Chang C.W. Chuang W.J. Lin Y.S. Wu J.J. Liu C.C. Chang W.T. Lin M.T. Infect.

For transfection, cells (5 × 106) were washed with serum-free minimal essential medium and incubated in a medium containing 2.5 μg of DNA and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum for an additional 24 h before the assay. The enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive cells were sorted by FACSAria (BD Biosciences) with a purity ranging from 72 to 76% in different experiments. For the JAK2, p38, and Bax silencing assay, cells were transfected with control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), JAK2 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p38 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Bax siRNA (Cell signaling) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A549 cells at a density of 2 × 105/well were seeded into medium without antibiotics for 1 day before transfection. siRNA and siTransfection reagent were incubated separately with siTransfection medium at room temperature for 10 min, subsequently, both incubation media were combined and incubated at room temperature for another 30 min. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium without antibiotics, and the mixtures were added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 24 h. To verify the effectiveness of siRNAs, Western blotting was performed as described above (Supplement 1). Cells treated with SPE B, or other agents were fixed at −20 °C with 70% ethanol. After being washed once with PBS, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (40 μg/ml in PBS) (Sigma) containing ribonuclease (100 μg/ml) (Sigma) at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Apoptotic cells were quantified using FACScan with CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences) and presented as the percentage of hypodiploid cells. The interaction of STAT1 with DNA in A549 cells was evaluated by a ChIP assay (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (1 × 107) were washed with cold PBS and stimulated with new medium containing SPE B or G308S for 3 h. The cells were then treated with formaldehyde (1%) at room temperature for 60 min, washed 3 times with PBS, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The nuclei were prepared in SDS lysis buffer, and the lysates were sonicated 5 times for 10 s, each at 30% power using a sonic dismembrator (model 300; Fisher) to shear genomic DNA. Anti-STAT1-specific antibody (Calbiochem) and polyclonal rabbit IgG antibodies (Pierce) were used for immunoprecipitation. Samples (5 μl each) were analyzed by 35 rounds of PCR amplification. The procaspase 8 promoter region was analyzed with primers of 5′-ACAGTGCCAGGAAGTGAGAAAC-3′ and 5′-CAGATGCTCCAGAAATGCTAAT-3′. These primers were used, respectively, as upper and lower primers for the region −188/+126. The Bax promoter region was analyzed using the primers 5′-TAATCCCAGCGCTTTGGAAG-3′ and 5′-TGCAGAGACCTGGATCTAGC-3′. Statistical analysis was done using Student's t test or one way analysis of variance and then Tukey's post test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. We previously found that caspase 8 was activated first during SPE B-induced apoptosis (8.Tsai W.H. Chang C.W. Chuang W.J. Lin Y.S. Wu J.J. Liu C.C. Chang W.T. Lin M.T. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 7055-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To further delineate the activation process of caspase 8, a time course analysis of levels of procaspase 8 and caspase 8 in the presence of SPE B was conducted. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the level of caspase 8 increased in a time-dependent manner. As caspase 8 increased, the procaspase 8 level did not decrease concomitantly but, rather, increased slightly over time. A similar time course analysis was also performed in the presence of G308S, and different results were observed. The level of caspase 8 increased with time until 4 h post-treatment and then decreased slightly with time, whereas the level of procaspase 8 decreased with time (Fig. 1, C and D). Because activation of caspase 8 is through the cleavage of procaspase 8, an increase in caspase 8 is usually accompanied with a decrease in procaspase 8. The continuous increase of procaspase 8 in the presence of SPE B, but not in the presence of G308S, suggested that there must be a SPE B-specific pathway that up-regulates procaspase 8 production. The total RNA was then extracted, and the levels of procaspase 8 mRNA were analyzed by RT-PCR. Procaspase 8 mRNA expression increased with time in the presence of SPE B (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, no differences in the expression of procaspase 8 mRNA were found in the presence of G308S (Fig. 2, C and D). The up-regulation of procaspase 8 by SPE B, but not G308S, indicated that the process was mediated through integrin αVβ3.FIGURE 2SPE B induced procaspase 8 gene expression. Cells (3 × 106) were treated with SPE B (20 μg/ml) (A) and G308S (20 μg/ml) (C) or PBS (control (C)) for the indicated times. Total RNA was prepared from A549 cells and subjected to RT-PCR analysis of procaspase 8 mRNA expression. The cDNA was amplified with specific oligos for procaspase 8 and β-actin. A quantitative result of procaspase 8 versus β-actin is expressed as the relative ratio in the same way as described in Fig. 1, B and D. Results are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By modulating the expression of target genes, STAT transcription factors play important roles in apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that STAT1 up-regulates proapoptotic genes such as caspases and death receptors to promote apoptosis (12.Huang Y.Q. Li J.J. Karpatkin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6462-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22.Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). To determine whether STAT1 activation is a key event in SPE B-induced expression of procaspase 8, we evaluated the involvement of JAK2. When cells were incubated with SPE B for various times, tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 was detected 10 min after SPE B treatment, whereas no phosphorylation could be detected in cells pretreated with the JAK2 inhibitor, AG490 (Fig. 3A). However, when cells were incubated with G308S, the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 was not detected (Fig. 3B). Previously we demonstrated that there is a direct association between SPE B and integrin αVβ3. We then examined interactions between integrin αVβ3 and JAK2. As shown in Fig. 3C, JAK2 coprecipitated with αVβ3 in the presence of SPE B and not in the presence of G308S. The phosphorylation of STAT1 on tyrosine 701 was detected 15 min after SPE B treatment and was inhibited by AG490 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). When cells were pretreated with anti-αVβ3 antibody, STAT1 phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 was inhibited (Fig. 3E). When cells were transfected with JAK2 siRNA, STAT1 phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 was also abrogated (Fig. 3F). These observations indicate that SPE B induces STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation through integrin αVβ3 and JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Because STAT1 is a transcription factor that functions in the nucleus, it is important to determine whether SPE B induces STAT1 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus in A549 cells. Our results show that in the presence of SPE B, the level of STAT1 in the cytoplasmic extract decreased (Fig. 4A), whereas its level in the nucleus increased over time (Fig. 4B). STAT1 in the nuclear fraction was also confirmed with phospho-specific (Tyr701) anti-STAT1 antibody (Fig. 4C). Its formation and translocation was also inhibited by AG490 and not produced by G308S. We also investigated whether pathways in A549 cell induced by SPE B occur in other epithelial cell types. The results indicated that in HEp-2 cells, JAK2 and STAT1 were phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to SPE B treatment, and JAK2 acted upstream of STAT1 (Supplement 2, A and B). Because phosphorylation at the serine residue in the COOH terminus of the STAT protein is important to its transcriptional activity, we also evaluated this process in SPE B-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5A, levels of STAT1 phosphorylated at serine 727 were increased both in SPE B- and G308S-treated cells. Pretreatment of cells with anti-αVβ3 antibody or AG490 did not inhibit this phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). Our data suggest that an integrin-independent pathway mediates the phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 727. The increased level of phosphoserine 727 in the nucleus also indicates that phosphorylation of serine 727 alone is enough for nuclear entry. The involvement of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in the phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 727 was also studied. We found that SPE B stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK in A549 cells (Fig. 5C). SPE B or G308S treatment increased the nuclear level of STAT1 phosphorylated at serine 727, whereas the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, anti-Fas antibody, and p38 siRNA each inhibited serine phosphorylation of STAT1 induced either by SPE B or by G308S (Fig. 5D). The ERK inhibitor, PD98059, had no effect on serine 727 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the G308S-induced p38 phosphorylation decreased in the presence of SB203580 and anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 5E), suggesting that phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 727 is mediated through the Fas and p38 MAPK pathways. Similarly, SPE B also activated p38 and phosphorylated p38-regulated STAT1 serine 727 phosphorylation in HEp-2 cells (Supplement 3, A and B). We next analyzed the transcriptional levels of several pro-apoptotic genes. We found no differences in mRNA levels of caspase 2, caspase 3, or caspase 9 either in the presence or in the absence of SPE B (data not shown). However, the mRNA level of Bax increased over time in SPE B-treated cells (Fig. 6A). In the presence of SB203580, this increase was eliminated (Fig. 6B). Several studies have reported that p38 MAPK acts as a mediator of apoptosis under different physiological conditions (23.De Zutter G.S. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6168-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24.Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Lebedeva I.V. Sauane M. Gopalkrishnan R.V. Valerie K. Dent P. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25939-25948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It was also shown that p38 MAPK sensitized cells to apoptosis by increasing the levels of Bax and Fas (19.Porras A. Zuluaga S. Black E. Valladares A. Alvarez A.M. Ambrosino C. Benito M. Nebreda A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We found that SPE B and G308S both enhanced the generation of Bax protein and that the anti-Fas antibody inhibited this process (Fig. 6C). In addition, the increased levels of Bax induced by SPE B or G308S were inhibited by SB203580 (Fig. 6, D and E). These findings indicate that the Fas receptor and p38 MAPK are important mediators for the production of Bax by SPE B. To investigate the molecular basis of SPE B-induced up-regulation of procaspase 8, we studied whether the expression of procaspase 8 mRNA depends on STAT1 transcriptional activity. Using the ChIP assay, we found that in the presence of SPE B, STAT1 was bound to procaspase 8 promoter and that this binding was eliminated by AG490 but not affected by SB203580 (Fig. 7A). This suggests that phosphorylation of STAT1 at tyrosine 701 was necessary for its binding to procaspase 8 promoter, whereas the phosphorylation of serine 727 was not. Furthermore, AG490, SB203580, and siRNA of JAK2 and p38 inhibited procaspase 8 mRNA transcription (Fig. 7, B and C), which indicated that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 and serine 727 of STAT1 ar"

Mutations, such as V75M and V75A, emerge in patients infected with HIV-1 group M subtype B and group O variants, after failing treatment with stavudine (d4T) and other nucleoside RT inhibitors. V75I is an accessory mutation of the Q151M multidrug resistance complex of HIV-1 RT and is rarely associated with thymidine analogue resistance mutations (TAMs). In vitro, it confers resistance to acyclovir. TAMs confer resistance to zidovudine (AZT) and d4T by increasing the rate of ATP-mediated excision of the terminal nucleotide monophosphate (primer unblocking). In a wild-type HIV-1 group O RT sequence context, V75A and V75M conferred increased excision activity on d4T-terminated primers, in the presence of PP(i). In contrast, V75I decreased the PP(i)-mediated unblocking efficiency on AZT and d4T-terminated primers, in different sequence contexts (i.e. wild-type group M subtype B or group O RTs). Interestingly, in the sequence context of an excision-proficient RT (i.e. M41L/A62V/T69SSS/K70R/T215Y), the introduction of V75I led to a significant decrease of its ATP-dependent excision activity on AZT-, d4T-, and acyclovir-terminated primers. The excision rate of d4T-monophosphate in the presence of ATP (3.2 mm) was about 10 times higher for M41L/A62V/T69SSS/K70R/T215Y than for the mutant M41L/A62V/T69SSS/K70R/V75I/T215Y RT. The antagonistic effect of V75I with TAMs was further demonstrated in phenotypic assays. Recombinant HIV-1 containing the M41L/A62V/T69SSS/K70R/V75I/T215Y RT showed 18.3- and 1.5-fold increased susceptibility to AZT and d4T, respectively, in comparison with virus containing the M41L/A62V/T69SSS/K70R/T215Y RT."

Thus, cooperativity and enzyme catalysis are intimately linked, yet their linkage is poorly understood.

An array of biophysical and biochemical studies indicates that non-catalytic but conserved residues directly regulate the redistribution. Furthermore, factors such as ligands and temperature, individually or in concert, also strongly influence the redistribution. As a consequence, these factors also exert their influence on catalysis by profoundly influencing the pre-equilibrium facilitated dynamics of communication between multienzyme components.

Allostery in proteins emanates from a redistribution of the conformational ensemble (1.Hilser V.J. Thompson E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The generally accepted notion is that binding of a ligand to one site can affect the other through a propagated change in the protein shape; however, it has been shown that allosteric communication could also exist in the absence of such physical linkage (1.Hilser V.J. Thompson E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8311-8315Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the latter scenario, communication between structurally separated active sites is thermodynamic in nature. Cooperativity, a special case of allostery, is closely associated with ligand-induced conformational dynamics, which may provide free energy of allosteric coupling via entropic effects (2.Cooper A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 15296-15303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and of apo-E1ec and E1ec variants complexed with ThDP and PLThDP (9.Kale S. Arjunan P. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28106-28116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) revealed no structural inequivalence of the active centers and hence provided no hint as to how the two sites communicate structurally. The active center region of E1ec is highly dynamic, exhibiting ligand- and temperature-dependent conformational equilibrium involving the dynamic inner (encompassing residues 401–413) and outer loops (encompassing residues 541–557) from different subunits of an α2 dimer along with an always ordered helical segment (residues 525–535) (8.Arjunan P.

Using an array of biophysical and biochemical methods, we showed that this conformational equilibrium is also present in the unliganded enzyme (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such a “pre-equilibrium” is an intrinsic attribute of key functional proteins and has been shown to have important catalytic roles in many enzymes. Consistent with this idea, the pre-equilibrium in E1ec was shown to be critical for many of its catalytic functions starting from predecarboxylation events and culminating in the transfer of the acetyl moiety to the E2ec component (9.Kale S. Arjunan P. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28106-28116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, the pre-equilibrium was shown to “energetically promote” the covalent addition of substrate to the enzyme bound ThDP by decreasing the activation energy and was found to be rate-determining (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Pre-steady state analysis of the rate-determining step in E1ec revealed that it could be resolved into at least two phases: a fast phase followed by a slower one. This kinetic response suggested that one set of sites reacts rapidly, whereas the other set reacts slowly, a hallmark of negative cooperative behavior in which two active sites act asymmetrically, indicating intersubunit communication. A conformational pre-equilibrium is also an important feature of many enzymes exhibiting cooperativity in its action. Therefore, the pre-equilibrium in E1ec may also be an important modulator of the observed cooperative behavior. Although allosteric communication between distant sites is fundamental to the catalytic functions of enzymes, allosteric communication linked to catalytic turnover is poorly understood (11.Stetefeld J. Jenny M. Burkhard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13688-13693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide experimental evidence that the dynamics of both active center loops exhibit synchronous pre-equilibrium that occurs on a time scale similar to that of the rate-limiting catalytic step, and is essential for catalysis. Using an array of methods, we further show that the cooperativity detected in the E1ec rate-determining step is dynamically modulated and is the outcome of a redistribution of rate-promoting pre-equilibrium in an ensemble in response to interplay of temperature and ligand binding. The E. coli strain JRG 3456 deficient in native E1ec gene was transformed with pGS878 plasmid containing the aceE gene encoding the E1ec and was used for overexpression and site-directed mutagenesis. The pET-22b(+)-1-lip E2 vector transformed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells was used for overexpression of 1-lip E2, a construct with a single lipoyl domain, instead of three lipoyl domains in the wild-type E2ec, but shown to be very similar in biochemical properties to the latter but more suitable to mechanistic studies. Activity was measured with either 1-lip E2 or 3-lipoyl domain E2ec (the latter was obtained from the National BioResource Project (Japan)) and E3ec as described earlier (12.Nemeria N. Volkov A. Brown A. Yi J. Zipper L. Guest J.R. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mass ratio of E1ec·E2ec·E3ec complex was 1:5:5. The procedures for expression, purification, and activity measurements of E1ec and its singly substituted variants were described previously (13.Yi J. Nemeria N. McNally A. Jordan F. Machado R.S.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14037-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The following primers (substitutions underlined) were used for construction of singly substituted E1ec variants: N548A, 5′-AGTACACCCCGGCGGACCGCGAGCAGGTTGC-3′; E551A, 5′-GCAGGACCGCGCGCAGGTTGCTTACTATAAAG-3′; E551C, 5′-CAGTATACCCCGCAGGATCGCTGTCAGGTGGCG-3′;R550A, 5′-CAGTACACCCCGCAGGACGCCGAGCAGGTTGC-3′; D549A, 5′-CAGTACACCCCGCAGGCCCGCGAGCAGGTTGC-3′. CD spectroscopy was used to determine the dissociation constant (Kd(PLThDP)) for binding of substrate analog MAP to E1ec and loop variants and was essentially similar to the method described earlier (9.Kale S. Arjunan P. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28106-28116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow CD spectra were recorded on the π*-180 CDF spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Temperature was adjusted to the desired value with an Rtϵ 7 Thermo NESLAB temperature controller. A slit width of 2 mm and path length of 10 mm were used. Reactions were monitored for the indicated times, and data were analyzed and prepared using Pro-K Global analysis software (Applied Photophysics) and Sigma Plot (Systat Software, Inc.), respectively. The PLThDP formation traces were fitted to a double exponential equation (y = A0 − A1exp(−k1t) − A2exp(−k2t)). The temperature dependence of pre-steady state kinetic data was analyzed by the Arrhenius equation, lnk=lnA-(EaRT)(Eq. 1) where Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, A is a pre-exponential factor, and T is temperature. Fluorescence quenching experiments were performed to determine the binding affinity of ThDP (Kd(ThDP)) as described previously (14.Nemeria N. Yan Y. Zhang Z. Brown A.M. Arjunan P. Furey W. Guest J.R. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45969-45978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The time dependence of reductive acetylation of independently expressed lipoyl domain by the E1ec component or by outer loop E1ec variants was monitored using a 4800 Plus matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The procedure was essentially similar to the one described previously (9.Kale S. Arjunan P. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28106-28116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The changes in relative intensities were fit to first-order decay (y = y0 + A1e−x/t) to derive the apparent rate constant, k′r (k′r = 1/t), for reductive acetylation. This procedure was described in detail previously (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The proximal location of residues Asp549, Gln548 located on the outer loop of one subunit, and Asn404 from the inner loop from the second subunit within hydrogen bonding distance (Fig. 1) and their conservation in homodimeric pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes and 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes (supplemental Fig. S1) suggests that these residues might have important role(s) in enzyme function (9.Kale S. Arjunan P. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28106-28116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of E1ec with the intermediate analogue PLThDP bound does not suggest direct involvement of Asp549 or Asn404 in predecarboxylation steps due to their large distance (at least in the ordered conformation) from the active center ThDP. However, distal residues have been shown to play important roles in catalysis and regulation by influencing the rate-promoting dynamic processes (16.Agarwal P.K. Billeter S.R. Rajagopalan P.T. Benkovic S.J. Hammes-Schiffer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2794-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 17.Rajagopalan P.T. Lutz S. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12618-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18.Tousignant A. Pelletier J.N. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1037-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis with E1ec, we created variants with alanine substitutions at these residues. The E1ec-specific activity (via reduction by the enamine of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol or DCPIP) for D549A and N404A was only modestly reduced by factors of 5 and 2, respectively, whereas the activity of the entire complex (NADH production after reconstitution with E2ec and E3ec) was reduced ∼260- and ∼56-fold, respectively (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1). This precipitous drop in overall complex activity as compared with DCPIP activity is an indication that the substitutions greatly impair intercomponent communication. Furthermore, the time-dependent reductive acetylation of lipoyl domain by D549A and N404A proceeded at a greatly reduced rate. Although E1ec completes this reaction in <30 s (our minimum reaction time for quenching manually mixed components), for the D549A and N404A variants, this reaction was incomplete even after 30 min of incubation, since the unacetylated lipoyl domain could still be detected in the reaction medium (Fig. 2B). The apparent rate constant for reductive acetylation (k′r) (the rate of transfer of acetyl group from E1ec to the lipoyl moiety on E2ec) was significantly lower as compared with that for E1ec. These results are in line with our previous results on other inner loop variants (9.Kale S. Arjunan P. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28106-28116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and support a generalized conclusion drawn with respect to ThDP-dependent enzymes, that loop disorder to order transition, manifested as pre-equilibrium in E1ec, also confers specificity of lipoyl domain recognition during transfer of acetyl group to the E2ec component (8.Arjunan P.

Stott K.M. Reche P.A. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This observation also supports the recent hypothesis (3.Seifert F. Golbik R. Brauer J. Lilie H. Schröder-Tittmann K. Hinze E. Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. Tittmann K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12775-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that for those ThDP enzymes that are part of multienzyme complexes (unlike the enzymes that are not part of such complexes), the active center dynamics also serves to support substrate channeling or, in the case of E1ec, the transfer of acetyl group to E2ec.FIGURE 2Biochemical signatures of pre-equilibrium disruption. A, activities and kinetic parameters of outer loop variants. The E1-specific assay used DCPIP reduction monitored at 600 nm (1 unit of activity = 1 μmol of DCPIP reduced/min/mg of E1ec). For overall complex activity (pyruvate:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity), the production of NADH was monitored at 340 nm (1 unit of activity = 1 μmol of NAD+ reduced/min/mg of E1ec). Detailed kinetic parameters of variants are summarized in supplemental Table S1. B, determination of dissociation constant for thiamin diphosphate (Kd(ThDP)) in E1ec and its variants. C, time-dependent reductive acetylation of lipoyl domain by D549A and N404A. Inner loop variants that resulted in impaired pre-equilibrium (9.Kale S. Arjunan P. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28106-28116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) are also shown for comparison. The apparent pseudo-first order rate constant (k′r) is also shown. D–F, formation of “carboligase” side reaction products acetolactate and acetoin on the E1ec, D549A, and N404A, respectively ((S)-acetoin gives a positive band with λmax near 280 nm, whereas (R)-acetolactate gives rise to a negative band with λmax at 301–302 nm) (21.Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The variants were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C, and protein was removed in each case with the help of a Centricon YM-30 (Millipore) unit. The carboligation product ratio (acetolactate to acetoin, ([AL]/[AC]), obtained from NMR) for each reaction is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) That the observed effects on kinetics emanate from disruption of interaction between the dynamic regions from two subunits is further supported by the fact that substitution of charged residues in the immediate vicinity of Asp549 and Gln548 (e.g. R550A and E551A) that are not involved in hydrogen bonding with the inner loop did not result in significant reduction in activities (supplemental Table S1). Fluorescence quenching experiments with ThDP yielded similar values of Kd(ThDP) for E1ec, D549A, and N404A (Fig. 2C), indicating that binding of coenzyme (and hence the active center) was unaffected by the substitutions. Therefore, the observed effects on kinetics are probably a result of disruption of interaction between the loops. Moreover, the unusual “carboligation” profile, resulting from impaired sequestering of active site chemistry from solvent (9.Kale S. Arjunan P. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28106-28116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), is also indicative of disruption of loop closure, due to disruption of interaction between the loops over the active center in loop-substituted variants (Fig. 2, D–F). Because substitutions on the inner loop invariably affected predecarboxylation steps on E1ec, we determined the ability of D549A and N404A variants to form PLThDP from MAP. Titration of the D549A and N404A with MAP shows small increases in the Kd(PLThDP) (the apparent PLThDP dissociation constant) as compared with E1ec (Fig. 3). Interestingly, both variants exhibited signal saturation at approximately half the CDmax, compared with the CD signal saturated with PLThDP at 300–305 nm observed with E1ec. This suggests that PLThDP formation proceeds in only half of the available sites. Thus, disruption of a dynamic intersubunit interaction among E1ec subunits results in half-of-the-sites reactivity, an extreme form of negative cooperativity. Interestingly, half-of-the-sites reactivity was not present with respect to ThDP (data not shown); this is in contrast to observations on other E1ec variants that displayed half-of-the-sites reactivity for both PLThDP and ThDP (23.Nemeria N. Tittmann K. Joseph E. Zhou L. Vazquez-Coll M.B. Arjunan P. Hübner G. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21473-21482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the effects of substitutions are limited solely to substrate turnover. In order to determine whether half-of-the-sites reactivity induced as a result of obliterating intersubunit/interloop interaction is a consequence of altered mobility of the outer loop, we first investigated whether the outer loop (bearing residues Asp549 and Gln548), like the inner loop, exhibits rate-promoting pre-equilibrium and whether pre-equilibrium occurs on catalytic time scales and is thus important for catalysis. Using 19F NMR methodology we utilized earlier (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) for qualitative and quantitative characterization of inner loop dynamics, we ascertained that the outer loop also exhibits “open-closed” conformational pre-equilibrium (Fig. 4A). The line shape simulations of the 19F NMR spectra of the E551C-TFA (trifluoroacetonyl group introduced at E551C-substituted cysteineless E1ec) (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S2) at different temperatures, within the experimental error range, yielded an exchange rate constant of <1 s−1. In order of magnitude, this value is similar to the observed kcat of the E551C-TFA (kcat = 0.74 s−1 at 30 °C) and kex (kex = kAB + kBA) for the inner loop (also <1 s−1) (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting synchronicity and quantitative correlation of outer and inner loop dynamics with catalysis in E1ec. Therefore, we conclude that the dynamics of the two active center loops are concerted and represent a rate-limiting catalytic step or a synchronous rate-promoting pre-equilibrium. Moreover, as observed with the inner loop (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), Lorentzian deconvolution of the E551C-TFA 19F NMR spectra at different temperatures also revealed that the outer loop open-closed population transition with respect to temperature is not linear; instead, there is a step deviation (Ttran) of pre-equilibrium in favor of the open conformation above 25 °C (Fig. 4B). It has been suggested that ThDP-dependent enzymes are only catalytically active in the “closed” conformation (24.Sundström M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas the open conformation is a binding-competent conformation as we had observed earlier on E1ec (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, E1ec undergoes a large scale “binding activation transition” at 25 °C. This was also observed in the inner loop populations and is significant because it is also apparent in the variation of kcat with temperature for E1ec (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The latter observation indicates that synchronous loop dynamics remains a rate-determining factor (influences kcat) in E1ec catalysis at all temperatures tested. Our earlier thermodynamic studies showed (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) E1ec to exhibit hallmark features of a protein in which ligand binding is coupled to a conformational change and the thermodynamic signatures of a pre-equilibrium. Briefly, the MAP-binding isotherm to E1ec above (25 °C) revealed a marked initial response in which the heat released per mole of injected MAP increases before declining to zero as the enzyme is saturated with MAP. This suggests that binding of the initial MAP ligands (and presumably substrate pyruvate) occur to thermodynamically distinct sites from the subsequent binding sites, implying interaction between binding sites. The parameters derived revealed that the apparent negative cooperativity at higher temperature is entropically (dynamically) driven. The D549A and N404A variants could not be analyzed by ITC due to low heats. Thus, to determine whether the outer loop substitutions and their effects on cooperativity are caused by disruption of pre-equilibrium, we determined the temperature dependence of kfast and kslow. As with the reaction of MAP with E1ec (see below), kfast increased while kslow decreased with increasing temperature; however, the temperature dependence was once more nonlinear, resulting in nonlinear Arrhenius plots (supplemental Fig. S2A). Nonlinear Arrhenius plots have been attributed to 1) a change in a rate-limiting step, 2) conformational changes in the enzyme, or 3) a change in the specific heat of the reactant. In the present case, since we had shown that the rate-limiting step does not change with temperature (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the observed nonlinearity supports pre-equilibrium and the associated changes in specific heat capacity, as observed in ITC data on E1ec. In fact, a convex Arrhenius plot is characteristic of enzyme-catalyzed reactions involving two or more competing enzymatic forms, each dominating in a different temperature range (25.Massey V. Curti B. Ganther H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2347-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Truhlar D. Kohen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A convex Arrhenius plot entails Ea (and hence ΔH*, the enthalpy of activation) decreasing with increasing temperature, concomitant with increasing frequency of rate-promoting process (in the case of E1ec, the rate-limiting pre-equilibrium). Importantly, the discontinuity in kfast and kslow, occurs at ∼25 °C (the “activation transition” temperature observed above), further lowering the Ea required for the kfast (covalent addition of substrate) and kslow (redistribution of pre-equilibrium) processes. This is consistent with ITC (10.Kale S. Ulas G. Song J. Brudvig G.W. Furey W. Jordan F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008;"

It also appears to be involved in cellular morphogenesis processes. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that Rad53 is phosphorylated at multiple SQ/TQ and at SP/TP residues, which are typical consensus sites for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases and CDKs, respectively. Here we show that Clb-CDK1 phosphorylates Rad53 at Ser774 in metaphase. This phosphorylation event does not influence the DNA damage and replication checkpoint roles of Rad53, and it is independent of the spindle assembly checkpoint network. Moreover, the Ser-to-Asp mutation, mimicking a constitutive phosphorylation state at site 774, causes sensitivity to calcofluor, supporting a functional linkage between Rad53 and cellular morphogenesis.

Protein kinases are fundamental regulators of cellular metabolism and cell cycle progression. Therefore, understanding how they are regulated is a very important challenge for the comprehension of several cellular pathways. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad53 is a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase, and it is well established that Rad53 family members, including the Chk2 protein kinase in human cells, play a central role in the signal transduction pathway activated in response to DNA lesions and help prevent genome rearrangements and cancer (1.Stracker T.H. Usui T. Petrini J.H. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2.Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Rad53 is phosphorylated by the upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases Mec1 and Tel1 (ATR and ATM in human cells); this triggers autophosphorylation events, leading to full activation of the kinase (3.Pellicioli A. Foiani M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R769-R771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to the kinase domain, Rad53 presents two FHA domains through which the protein interacts with substrates and regulators (4.Hammet A. Pike B.L. McNees C.J. Conlan L.A. Tenis N. Heierhorst J. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rad53 also contains a bipartite NLS domain in the C-terminal region (5.Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P.

However, it is unlikely that Rad53 kinase activity plays a role in response to spindle damage because Rad53, prepared from cells treated with nocodazole (an agent that cause spindle depolimerization and triggers the spindle assembly checkpoint), does not exhibit autophosphorylation activity, as determined by in situ kinase assay (8.Tercero J.A. Longhese M.P. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1323-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar); moreover, rad53Δ cells are not sensitive to spindle-damaging agents. Finally, Rad53 appears to be involved in cellular morphogenesis (9.Enserink J.M. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. Kolodner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10.Smolka M.B. Chen S.H. Maddox P.S. Enserink J.M. Albuquerque C.P. Wei X.X. Desai A. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In fact, rad53Δ cells have an abnormal shape and are sensitive to morphogenesis-stressing agents (9.Enserink J.M. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. Kolodner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that the roles of Rad53 in morphogenesis are not dependent on Mec1-dependent phosphorylation, and it is unknown whether the role of Rad53 in morphogenesis is regulated during the cell cycle. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Rad53 is phosphorylated at many serine and threonine sites, and, interestingly, it is phosphorylated at proline-directed Ser175, Ser375, and Ser774 sites in exponentially growing cells, without any DNA and/or spindle damage (5.Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11.Sweeney F.D. Yang F. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Durocher D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1364-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the CDK1 cell cycle kinase may directly phosphorylate Rad53 and influence its activity, as supported by recent observations implicating CDK1 in DNA damage checkpoint activation (12.Ira G. Pellicioli A. Balijja A. Wang X. Fiorani S. Carotenuto W. Liberi G. Bressan D. Wan L. Hollingsworth N.M. Haber J.E. Foiani M. Nature. 2004; 431: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 13.Enserink J.M. Hombauer H. Huang M.E. Kolodner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 423-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that CDK1 phosphorylates Rad53 in metaphase, without any damage to the spindle or genomic DNA, and that most of the modification that had been previously described as induced by spindle damage (7.Clémenson C. Marsolier-Kergoat M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) is instead due to the accumulation of cells in metaphase induced by the spindle-damaging agent. The Ser774 residue is the main target for CDK1-dependent Rad53 modification in metaphase. Interestingly, the Ser-to-Asp mutation of residue 774, mimicking a constitutively phosphorylation state, causes sensitivity to calcofluor (a morphogenetic stress agent), further suggesting a role for Rad53 in controlling cellular morphogenesis. Our findings raise the possibility that the role of Rad53 in morphogenesis (9.Enserink J.M. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. Kolodner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) may be modulated during the cell cycle by CDK1. Furthermore, none of the CDK1-dependent phosphorylation events occurring on Rad53 at metaphase appear to have any role in promoting Rad53 activation in response to DNA damage or replication stress. All strains are isogenic derivatives of W303. The genotypes of the yeast strains utilized in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. To obtain strains Y849 and Y850, plasmid pVF6 (generously provided by F. Vanoli and M. Foiani), carrying the cdc28-as1 mutant allele, was cut with ClaI and integrated in the CDC28 locus. All the experiments were done in YPD medium containing 10 g yeast extract, 20 g peptone, glucose 2% final concentration, H2O to 1 liter; the pH was adjusted to 5.4 with HCl. E. coli strain (DH5α) was used for the production of mutants and cloning; E. coli cultures were grown in LD medium containing 10 g bactotryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl, H2O to 1 liter, and the pH was adjusted to 7.25. The plasmid pCH10, carrying RAD53-9myc under the control of its own promoter (14.Pellicioli A. Lucca C. Liberi G. Marini F. Lopes M. Plevani P. Romano A. Di Fiore P.P. Foiani M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6561-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), was cut with Not1 and ligated to obtained the pCla6 plasmid, carrying RAD53 without the 9myc epitope cassette. pCla6 was used in PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to generate the mutations rad53-S175A/S175D, rad53-S375A/S375D, and rad53-S774A/S774D. Two complementary oligonucleotides (listed in supplemental Table S3) containing the selected mutation were used to amplify the plasmid pCla6. The PCR product was subsequently digested with DpnI to eliminate the wild type template, and the obtained DNA was used to transform E. coli DH5α cells. The resulting plasmids (listed in supplemental Table S2) were verified by DNA sequencing. This kind of mutagenesis has been described previously (15.Fiorani S. Mimun G. Caleca L. Piccini D. Pellicioli A. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To construct yeast strains, standard genetic procedures for transformation and tetrad analysis were followed. The TCA protein extraction and the Western blot procedures have been described previously (15.Fiorani S. Mimun G. Caleca L. Piccini D. Pellicioli A. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Rad53 protein was analyzed using the specific monoclonal antibodies (Mab.EL7) that we have recently produced (15.Fiorani S. Mimun G. Caleca L. Piccini D. Pellicioli A. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In some experiments (Fig. 3), the SDS-PAGE analysis was performed in a larger apparatus and at 4 °C, conditions that improved the separation of the Rad53 phosphorylated isoforms. Crude extracts were prepared as described (14.Pellicioli A. Lucca C. Liberi G. Marini F. Lopes M. Plevani P. Romano A. Di Fiore P.P. Foiani M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6561-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and resuspended in λ phosphatase buffer with or without 4000 units of λ phosphatase (Biolabs). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Cells were presynchronized in G1 with α-factor (2 μg/ml) and then released in fresh medium. Cells were arrested in G1 and G2/M with α-factor (10 μg/ml) or nocodazole (15 μg/ml), respectively. DNA content was analyzed by FACSCalibur (Bekton-Dickinson) and CellQuest software (Bekton-Dikinson). Several amino acid residues of the Rad53 protein have been found to be phosphoryated in vivo. Most of these modifications occur in cells treated with DNA damaging agents and likely drive full activation of the kinase toward specific substrates (5.Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H.

Hunt D.F. Durocher D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1364-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, mass spectrometry analysis has revealed that some Rad53 residues are phosphorylated even in cells growing in unperturbed conditions, raising the possibility that Rad53 protein is regulated throughout a normal cell cycle (5.Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11.Sweeney F.D. Yang F. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Durocher D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1364-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed a slower migrating Rad53 isoform in nocodazole-treated cells in the absence of any DNA damage (Fig. 1A). This nocodazole-induced Rad53 isoform is due to phosphorylation events because it is reverted by in vitro treatment with λ phosphatase (Fig. 1A). Our results, together with previous findings (7.Clémenson C. Marsolier-Kergoat M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8.Tercero J.A. Longhese M.P. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1323-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 12.Ira G. Pellicioli A. Balijja A. Wang X. Fiorani S. Carotenuto W. Liberi G. Bressan D. Wan L. Hollingsworth N.M. Haber J.E. Foiani M. Nature. 2004; 431: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), indicate that Rad53 is phosphorylated in cells responding to spindle defects caused by the nocodazole treatment. Because the genetic requirements for the nocodazole-induced Rad53 modification has not been extensively studied, we then analyzed whether such Rad53 modification was due to in trans phosphorylation events, mediated by specific kinases, or whether it had to be ascribed to autophosphorylation. Taking advantage of the biochemical features of the Rad53-K227A (Rad53-kd) kinase-defective protein variant (6.Zheng P. Fay D.S. Burton J. Xiao H. Pinkham J.L. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5829-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which receives in trans phosphorylation from the upstream kinase Mec1 but is defective in the autophosphorylation reaction (14.Pellicioli A. Lucca C. Liberi G. Marini F. Lopes M. Plevani P. Romano A. Di Fiore P.P. Foiani M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6561-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), we analyzed Rad53 modification in mec1Δ or rad53-kd cells arrested with α-factor or nocodazole. Exponentially growing cells (Fig. 1B) have been blocked with α-factor or nocodazole in G1 or M phase, respectively; cell cycle arrest was confirmed by FACS analysis (Fig. 1B). By Western blotting, Rad53 does not show any gel mobility shift in G1-blocked cells. On the other hand, the protein is clearly phosphorylated in nocodazole-treated cells, and this modification is not mediated by Mec1, in agreement with previous indications (7.Clémenson C. Marsolier-Kergoat M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), or by autophosphorylation events. In fact, the retarded form of Rad53 observed in metaphase-arrested cells is still evident in mec1Δ and rad53-kd cells. It is known that nocodazole treatment causes spindle damage and cell cycle block in metaphase due to activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) 3The abbreviations used are: SACspindle assembly checkpointFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterkdkinase defective. (16.Lew D.J. Burke D.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 251-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). SAC prevents activation of the anaphase-promoting complex, whose activity is required to inhibit Clb-CDK1; indeed, nocodazole-treated cells are characterized by high activity of the Clb-CDK1 complex (17.Hoyt M.A. Totis L. Roberts B.T. Cell. 1991; 66: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). We thus decided to explore the possibility that Clb-CDK1 may be responsible for Rad53 phosphorylation in metaphase. spindle assembly checkpoint fluorescence-activated cell sorter kinase defective. In S. cerevisiae, the catalytic subunit of the Clb-CDK1 complex is expressed by the essential gene CDC28 (18.Nasmyth K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the cdc28-as1 mutant, sensitive to the ATP analogue 1NMPP1 (19.Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. Wood J.L. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Nature. 2000; 407: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), to inhibit CDK1 activity in nocodazole-treated cells. Presently, this mutation, used in conjunction with the 1NMPP1 molecule, is the most tunable way to specifically switch off CDK1 activity. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that 1NMPP1 does not inhibit wild type CDK1 or other kinases at the experimental concentrations used, while specifically inhibiting CDK1 activity in the cdc28-as1 mutant background, that has been engineered to become a specific target of 1NMPP1 (19.Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. Wood J.L. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Nature. 2000; 407: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). cdc28-as1 exponentially growing cells were treated with nocodazole for 3 h to induce cell cycle arrest and phosphorylation of Rad53 protein. We then divided the cell culture in two parts and added 1NMPP1 to one-half to inhibit Cdc28 kinase. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A) revealed that inhibition of CDK1 rapidly leads to the disappearance of phosphorylated Rad53 isoforms, indicating that CDK1 activity is required to maintain Rad53 phosphorylation in nocodazole-treated cells. CDK1 activity is cell cycle-regulated and its specificity toward substrates is determined by the association with various cyclin subunits (18.Nasmyth K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Cyclins Cln1–3 are specific for G1 phase, Clb5 and 6 are mainly required for DNA replication, and Clb1–4 are more important in G2/M and exit from mitosis. To determine which cyclin is involved in cells responding to nocodazole, we studied Rad53 phosphorylation in clb5Δ, clb2Δ, and clb2Δclb5Δ double mutants. Cells were treated with nocodazole for 3 h, and Rad53 phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting. We found that Rad53 phosphorylation is prevented in clb2Δ and clb2Δclb5Δ cells, but it is maintained in clb5Δ cells (Fig. 2B). Taken together, the results described in Fig. 2 indicate that CDK1 kinase, mainly associated with cyclin Clb2, is required for Rad53 phosphorylation in cells treated with nocodazole. The results described so far may indicate a direct effect of CDK1 on Rad53, or they might be explained by assuming that nocodazole treatment activates the SAC, and one or more kinases of this pathway may phosphorylate Rad53 in a CDK1-dependent manner. Indeed, mutations in spindle assembly checkpoint factors, such as mad2Δ and bub2Δ, prevent nocodazole-induced Rad53 phosphorylation (7.Clémenson C. Marsolier-Kergoat M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, abrogation of the spindle assembly checkpoint through specific mutations also eliminates the cell cycle block at metaphase caused by nocodazole treatment, preventing the possibility to maintain high levels of Clb-CDK1 activity. Moreover, previous work (7.Clémenson C. Marsolier-Kergoat M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) failed to identify a kinase among the spindle assembly checkpoint factors that is responsible for the nocodazole-induced Rad53 phosphorylation. Thus, we investigated the possibility that CDK1 may directly induce Rad53 phosphorylation at the metaphase-anaphase transition independently on SAC activation. To visualize CDK1-dependent Rad53 phosphorylation through a normal cell cycle, wild type cells were synchronized in G1 by α-factor treatment and released into fresh medium without the pheromone. Cell cycle progression after the release from the G1 block was followed by FACS analysis (Fig. 3A). Rad53 protein level and its modifications were analyzed (Fig. 3B) using the highly specific Mab.EL7 monoclonal antibody that we recently described (15.Fiorani S. Mimun G. Caleca L. Piccini D. Pellicioli A. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows that the monoclonal antibody Mab.EL7 detects a modification of Rad53 in samples taken at different time points during an unperturbed cell cycle. The slower migrating isoform of Rad53 is accumulated at time points corresponding to the G2/M transition, and it is not visualized in G1 and at the early stage of S phase, as supported by the FACS profiles (Fig. 3A). The possibility that this cell cycle-dependent Rad53 modification may be associated to the kinase activity of Rad53 itself is unlikely. In fact, by using a highly sensitive in situ assay, we and others (8.Tercero J.A. Longhese M.P. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1323-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14.Pellicioli A. Lucca C. Liberi G. Marini F. Lopes M. Plevani P. Romano A. Di Fiore P.P. Foiani M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6561-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) failed to gain any evidence indicating that Rad53 kinase activity may fluctuate during an unperturbed cell cycle. The cell cycle-dependent modification of Rad53 at G2/M under unperturbed conditions, suggests that the Rad53 phosphorylated form detected after nocodazole treatment is simply related to a G2/M cell cycle block, rather than to SAC activation. Therefore, we assumed that the accumulation of the CDK1-dependent phosphorylated form of Rad53 could be better visualized in a cell population uniformly arrested in mitosis. To block cell cycle in metaphase without triggering the SAC, we took advantage of a genetic system in which we can deplete Cdc20 by switching off the expression of the corresponding gene. Indeed, Cdc20 is an unstable protein required to activate anaphase-promoting complex and drive the exit from mitosis (20.Lim H.H. Goh P.Y. Surana U. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 231-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this strain, expression of CDC20 under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter is repressed by addition of glucose into the culture medium. Because Cdc20 is one of the final targets of the spindle assembly checkpoint cascade, this genetic system is widely used to block cell cycle progression in metaphase, mimicking the effect of the spindle assembly checkpoint activation without generating any damage to the spindle (20.Lim H.H. Goh P.Y. Surana U. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 231-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of glucose to exponentially growing GAL1::CDC20 cells represses the CDC20 expression, leading to a progressive accumulation of cells in metaphase due to the inability to activate anaphase-promoting complex as a consequence of Cdc20 depletion. At different times after glucose addition, samples were taken to monitor FACS profiles and Rad53 protein levels and modifications. Fig. 4A shows that Rad53 phosphorylation correlates with the accumulation of cells in mitosis. Moreover, treatment with nocodazole 6 h after Cdc20 depletion only led to a mild but noticeable increase in the fraction of cells blocked in M phase and in the intensity of the Rad53-phosphorylated band. These results suggest that the SAC is not involved in phosphorylating Rad53 in mitosis, whereas it sustains the idea that CDK1, whose activity is high in CDC20-depleted cells, is directly involved in phosphorylating Rad53. To test whether the Rad53 phosphorylation detected in cells blocked by CDC20 depletion was due to CDK1 activity, we repeated the previous experiment in a GAL1::CDC20 strain carrying the cdc28-as1 mutation (Fig. 4B). 6 h after the addition of glucose, the culture was split into two, and the 1NMPP1 inhibitor was added to half of the culture. Fig. 4B clearly shows that inactivation of CDK1 prevents Rad53 phosphorylation in cells arrested in mitosis. The findings described above indicate that high activity of the Clb-CDK1 kinase complex in mitosis promotes Rad53 phosphorylation, similarly to what is found in nocodazole-treated cells, also suggesting that Rad53 phosphorylation induced by nocodazole treatment is due, at least partially, to CDK1 activity and ruling out the possibility that it requires activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (7.Clémenson C. Marsolier-Kergoat M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CDK1 consensus phosphorylation sites are serine or threonine residues followed by a proline (SP/TP). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Rad53 is phosphorylated at three proline-directed sites: Ser175, Ser375, and Ser774 (5.Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11.Sweeney F.D. Yang F. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Durocher D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1364-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), supporting our data suggesting that CDK1 directly phosphorylates Rad53 in metaphase. In agreement with this hypothesis, Xenopus p34, the frog homolog of Cdc28, phosphorylates Rad53 in vitro (5.Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We explored whether one or more of the three proline-directed sites indicated above are responsible for Rad53 phosphorylation in mitotic cells. We mutagenized the three sites to alanine or aspartate to mimic the nonphosphorylatable or the constitutively phosphorylated state, respectively, generating the rad53-S175A, rad53-S375A, rad53-S774A, rad53-S175D, rad53-S375D, and rad53-S774D alleles. First, we analyzed the level and the activity of the mutant Rad53 proteins in cells growing in normal condition or experiencing DNA damage (zeocine treatment) or replication stress (hydroxyurea treatment). Fig. 5B shows that none of the alleles display any significant change in Rad53 protein level in exponentially growing conditions, and the mutations do not affect Rad53 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage or replication stress. We then tested the effect of these site-specific mutations on the phosphorylation of Rad53 in cells arrested in mitosis by nocodazole treatment. We found that although the Rad53-S175A and Rad53-S375A mutant forms are phosphorylated as the wild type protein in nocodazole-treated cells, the Rad53-S774A form is not (Fig. 5C). In nocodazole-blocked cells, Rad53-S774A protein variant lost the hyperphosphorylation shift in the Western blotting analysis, although we cannot rule out completely the possibility that the Rad53-S774A variant may still retain a minor modification that proved to be difficult to be visualized under our gel electrophoresis conditions. This finding suggests that in mitotic cells, Rad53 is mainly phosphorylated by CDK1 on serine 774 and that S774 phosphorylation is responsible for the major Rad53 electrophoretic mobility shift observed in nocodazole-treated cells. To explore the functional role of the CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad53, we analyzed the sensitivity of the rad53 mutant strains to different toxic agents. Serial dilutions of cells of the various rad53 strains were plated in the presence of different concentrations of hydroxyurea treatment or methyl metanesulfonate (a DNA-alkylating agent). Wild type or rad53Δ strains were used as controls in the plates. The plates were analyzed after 3 days of incubation at 28 °C (Fig. 6A). We found that none of the rad53 alleles tested were sensitive to hydroxyurea treatment or methyl metanesulfonate. This result is in agreement with our previous finding (Fig. 5B), indicating that the various Rad53 mutations do not prevent Rad53 activation following DNA damage and replication stress. By a similar approach, we then tested the sensitivity to benomyl, a spindle-damaging agent. In this case, as controls we used mec1Δ and mad2Δ strains (Fig. 6B). As shown previously (21.Li R. Murray A.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), mad2Δ cells are sensitive to spindle damage, whereas strains mutated in the MEC1 and RAD53 kinases do not cause any sensitivity. We found also that the CDK1-phosphosite mutants of Rad53 are not sensitive to benomyl, ruling out the possibility that CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad53 might have a functional role in the spindle assembly checkpoint. Recently, Rad53 was implicated in morphogenesis (9.Enserink J.M. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. Kolodner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The relationship between the function of Rad53 in the DNA damage checkpoint and its role in cellular morphogenesis is not yet understood. Moreover, the observation that the Mec1 kinase and other DNA damage checkpoint factors are not involved in cellular morphogenesis (9.Enserink J.M. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. Kolodner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10.Smolka M.B. Chen S.H. Maddox P.S. Enserink J.M. Albuquerque C.P. Wei X.X. Desai A. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), leads to the hypothesis that Rad53 function in this pathway is separated from its role in response to DNA damage. Because serine 774 is the main CDK1-dependent modification of Rad53 in metaphase, we tested the sensitivity of the rad53-S774A and rad53-S774D mutant strains to calcofluor white. This agent interferes with cell wall synthesis and cellular morphogenesis (9.Enserink J.M. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. Kolodner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of cells were plated in the presence of various concentrations of calcofluor white, and the plates were incubated at 28 °C for 3 days. rad53Δ mutants are very sensitive to morphogenetic stress, as reported previously (9.Enserink J.M. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. Kolodner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that phospho-mimicking rad53-S774D mutant cells are sensitive to calcofluor white, albeit less than rad53Δ cells, whereas rad53-S774A cells are not (Fig. 6C). We also found that rad53-Δ781, expressing a truncated variant of Rad53 protein that lacks the NLS motif (5.Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6.Zheng P. Fay D.S. Burton J. Xiao H. Pinkham J.L. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5829-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), is also sensitive to calcofluor white. The results described in Fig. 6 suggest that CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad53 does not play any role in the response to DNA or spindle damage. Moreover, the sensitivity of rad53-S774D mutant to calcofluor rises the possibility that CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad53 may influence Rad53 function during morphogenesis and/or in the response to morphogenesis stress. Biochemical and genetic analysis have shown that Mec1 and/or Tel1, the upstream kinases in the checkpoint cascade, phosphorylate Rad53 at multiple SQ/TQ residues, through the action of a mediator protein (Rad9 or Mrc1), which likely promote the optimal interaction between Rad53 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (1.Stracker T.H. Usui T. Petrini J.H. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 3.Pellicioli A. Foiani M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R769-R771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22.Stracker T.H. Usui T. Petrini J.H. DNA Repair (Amst). 2009; PubMed Google Scholar). The in trans phosphorylation of Rad53 is followed by its autophosphorylation, leading to full activation of the kinase in the presence of DNA damage or replication stress. Whether Rad53 is activated in unperturbed exponentially growing cells was an argument of discussion: on one hand, mutations abrogating the catalytic activity of Rad53 cause cell lethality (23.Fay D.S. Sun Z. Stern D.F. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that its kinase activity is essential in unperturbed conditions; on the other hand, the methods currently used to measure Rad53 kinase activity do not reveal any active Rad53 form in unperturbed exponentially growing cells (14.Pellicioli A. Lucca C. Liberi G. Marini F. Lopes M. Plevani P. Romano A. Di Fiore P.P. Foiani M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6561-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15.Fiorani S. Mimun G. Caleca L. Piccini D. Pellicioli A. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One possible interpretation is that the procedures to test Rad53 kinase activity are not sensitive enough to detect a very low level of activity. Hence, most of the details leading to phosphorylation and activation of Rad53 have been analyzed in response to DNA damage and replication stress, and the regulation of Rad53 in untreated exponentially growing cells is much less studied. Recently, accurate mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Rad53 is phosphorylated at SP/TP residues in exponentially growing cells (5.Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11.Sweeney F.D. Yang F. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Durocher D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1364-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), suggesting that during an unperturbed cell cycle, Rad53 may be the target of a kinase different from Mec1 and Tel1 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases. Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that CDK1 phosphorylates Rad53 at the G2/M transition in an unperturbed cell cycle, and this modification is clearly visible in metaphase-arrested cells (Figs. 2 and 3). These findings support the hypothesis that CDK1 is at least one of the kinases modifying Rad53 in exponentially growing conditions. Previous observations (7.Clémenson C. Marsolier-Kergoat M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) led to the hypothesis that an undescribed kinase, likely activated by the SAC pathway, phosphorylates Rad53 in response to spindle damage. Our findings indicate that the Rad53 phosphorylation detected in mitotic cells does not require DNA damage or spindle checkpoint pathways but, instead, it is a metaphase-anaphase event carried out by CDK1, which targets the serine 774 residue of Rad53. We also found that inactivation of CDK1 abrogates Rad53 phosphorylation observed after spindle damage (Fig. 2). Although alternative hypothesis can be suggested, we favor the idea that CDK1 phosphorylates Rad53 at metaphase and that the Rad53 phosphorylation observed in cells with damaged spindles is possibly due to the fact that the SAC pathway blocks the cell cycle at the metaphase-anaphase transition with high Clb-CDK1 activity. Moreover, we failed to observe any sensitivity to benomyl in various rad53 mutant cells (Fig. 6), and there is no evidence that Rad53 activity is required in response to spindle damage. What is the functional significance of the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Rad53 mediated by CDK1? Interestingly, rad53-S774D mutant cells, in which the main CDK1 phosphorylation site mimics a constitutively phosphorylated state, are sensitive to calcofluor white (Fig. 6), suggesting morphogenetic dysfunctions. Because the Ser774 residue is the main target for the CDK1-dependent Rad53 phosphorylation at metaphase, it is tempting to speculate that CDK1 may regulate Rad53 to orchestrate cellular morphogenesis during the cell cycle. Surprisingly, the nonphosphorylatable rad53-S774A mutant allele does not show any calcofluor sensitivity. Opposing phenotypes of mutations altering the phosphorylation of a specific residue have been observed in the regulation of kinases (24.Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar) and of other relevant proteins (for an example, see Ref. 25.Downs J.A. Lowndes N.F. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Such an effect has been extensively characterized biochemically for certain protein kinases (24.Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar), whereas for most proteins, the biochemical details remain obscure. Concerning the effect of opposite mutations at the Ser774 residue of Rad53, an attractive hypothesis may be related to the location of the phosphorylatable residue, which is positioned near the NLS motif (amino acids 781–801; see Fig. 4A). We speculate that such a residue may influence the subcellular localization of Rad53 or its interaction with specific cellular structures. Interestingly, the Rad53-Δ781 mutant protein, which lacks the NLS (5.Smolka M.B. Albuquerque C.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6.Zheng P. Fay D.S. Burton J. Xiao H. Pinkham J.L. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5829-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), is not phosphorylated in metaphase and in the presence of DNA damage (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, rad53-Δ781 cells are sensitive to calcofluor white, DNA damage, and replication stress (Fig. 6C and see Ref. 10.Smolka M.B. Chen S.H. Maddox P.S. Enserink J.M. Albuquerque C.P. Wei X.X. Desai A. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is possible that mimicking the constitutive phosphorylation of Ser774, the rad53-S774D mutation may deregulate the dynamics of Rad53 localization or intracellular interactions. However, because Rad53-S774D is properly activated in response to genotoxic stress (Fig. 5), and mutant cells are not sensitive to DNA damage (Fig. 6), we have to infer that in this mutant, a sufficient amount of Rad53 is localized in the nucleus. Direct microscopic examination of wild type and mutant Rad53 tagged with green fluorescent protein or other epitopes suitable for immunofluorescence analysis, failed to detect any evident alteration in the partition of Rad53 between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. 4L. Diani and A. Pellicioli, unpublished observations. Rad53 is an abundant protein that appears diffusely stained both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (10.Smolka M.B. Chen S.H. Maddox P.S. Enserink J.M. Albuquerque C.P. Wei X.X. Desai A. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Partial relocalization or accumulation of Rad53 to specific cellular compartments or structures is thus difficult to test by microscopic analysis. Recently, it was shown that Rad53 interacts with septins (10.Smolka M.B. Chen S.H. Maddox P.S. Enserink J.M. Albuquerque C.P. Wei X.X. Desai A. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and regulates the phosphorylation and timely degradation of Swe1 (9.Enserink J.M. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. Kolodner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which is the main kinase involved in the morphogenesis checkpoint controlling bud emergence and growth (26.Lew D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It will be a challenge for further studies to investigate whether the rad53-S774A/S774D mutations will influence Swe1 level and function in the cell, perhaps causing abnormalities in the cell wall and/or bud formation. The interaction of Rad53 with other proteins localized at specific cellular structures may be addressed by genetic screenings to identify synthetic interactions between the rad53-S774D/S774A mutant alleles and mutations in other yeast genes. Alternatively, the Rad53 interactors so far identified by tandem affinity purification-tagging methods (10.Smolka M.B. Chen S.H. Maddox P.S. Enserink J.M. Albuquerque C.P. Wei X.X. Desai A. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), can be challenged for their biochemical and genetic interactions with the Rad53-S774D/S774A protein variants. In conclusion, our findings indicate that CDK1 phosphorylates Rad53 in metaphase, and such modification may influence its role in modulating morphogenetic events, also supporting the notion of a molecular link between cell growth and genome integrity checkpoints (9.Enserink J.M. Smolka M.B. Zhou H. Kolodner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10.Smolka M.B. Chen S.H. Maddox P.S. Enserink J.M. Albuquerque C.P. Wei X.X. Desai A.

The contributions of individual residues within this region to inter-protein affinity and cofactor activity were assessed following alanine scanning mutagenesis of residues 555–571 that border or are contained within the loop. Variants were expressed as isolated A2 domains in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus construct and purified to >90%. Two reconstitution assays were employed to determine affinity and activity parameters. The first assay reconstituted factor Xase using varying concentrations of A2 mutant and fixed levels of A1/A3C1C2 dimer purified from wild type (WT), baby hamster kidney cell-expressed factor VIII, factor IXa, and phospholipid vesicles to determine the inter-molecular Kd for A2. The second assay determined the Kd for A2 in factor VIIIa by reconstituting various A2 and fixed levels of A1/A3C1C2. Parameter values were determined by factor Xa generation assays. WT A2 expressed in insect cells yielded similar Kd and kcat values following reconstitution as WT A2 purified from baby hamster kidney cell-expressed factor VIII. All A2 variants exhibited modest if any increases in Kd values for factor VIIIa assembly. However, variants S558A, V559A, D560A, G563A, and I566A showed >9-fold increases in Kd for factor Xase assembly, implicating these residues in stabilizing A2 association with factor IXa. Furthermore, variants Y555A, V559A, D560A, G563A, I566A, and D569A showed >80% reduction in kcat for factor Xa generation.

These results identify residues in the 558-loop critical to interaction with factor IXa in Xase. Factor VIIIa is an essential blood coagulation protein that acts as a cofactor for the serine protease factor IXa in the conversion of factor X to Xa during the propagation phase of coagulation. Defects or deficiencies in factors VIII and IX result in hemophilia A and B, respectively. Factor VIII is synthesized as a multidomain, single chain precursor with a molecular mass of ∼300 kDa and domain structure A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. It circulates primarily as a heterodimer resulting from proteolysis at the B-A3 junction wherein the heavy chain (A1A2B) and light chain (A3C1C2) are associated by metal ion-dependent and independent linkages (see Ref. 1.Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar for review). Factor VIII is activated by limited proteolysis catalyzed by thrombin or factor Xa to the active cofactor, factor VIIIa. These cleavages convert the heterodimer or single chain precursor to the heterotrimer (2.Lollar P. Parker C.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3.Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the heavy chain-derived A1 subunit and light chain-derived A3C1C2 subunit maintaining stable association, whereas the A2 subunit is weakly associated with the A1/A3C1C2 dimer through electrostatic interactions (4.Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIIIa can be reconstituted from the isolated A2 subunit and A1/A3C1C2 dimer to regenerate high levels of cofactor activity (3.Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Association of factors VIIIa and IXa on a phospholipid surface forms the intrinsic factor Xase complex, which increases the catalytic efficiency of factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X by >104 (6.van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence studies examining the active site of factor IXa have attributed this increase in kcat to the modulation of its active site by factor VIIIa (8.Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in particular, the A2 subunit of the cofactor (9.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Factor IXa in turn has been shown to stabilize factor VIIIa in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipid (10.Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Blood. 1984; 63: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by promoting association of A2 subunit with A1/A3C1C2 (11.Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6027-6032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This stabilization is derived from multiple interactions within the proteins. Studies involving monoclonal antibody targeted to the A3 domain and synthetic peptides suggest that residues 1811–1818 in that domain bind to the epidermal growth factor 1/2 regions of factor IXa (13.Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This interaction is of high affinity (Kd ∼ 15–50 nm) as determined by solid phase, non-equilibrium binding assay (14.Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or steady state fluorescence (15.Jenkins P.V. Dill J.L. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5094-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interaction between the A2 domain of factor VIIIa and the protease domain of factor IXa has been shown to be of low affinity (Kd ∼ 300 nm) (9.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A number of studies involving fluorescence, peptide, or antibody inhibition and analyses of point mutations in the hemophilia A data base have identified several sequences involved in this interaction (see Ref. 16.Fay P.J. Jenkins P.V. Blood Rev. 2005; 19: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar for a review). One region in A2, the 558-loop was identified as a factor IXa-interactive site by both peptide inhibition studies (17.Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by the capacity of factor IXa to selectively protect factor VIIIa from activated protein C-catalyzed cleavage at Arg-562 (18.Regan L.M. Lamphear B.J. Huggins C.F. Walker F.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9445-9452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Bajaj et al. (19.Bajaj S.P. Schmidt A.E. Mathur A. Padmanabhan K. Zhong D. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16302-16309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggested that residues within the A2 558-loop bind to the 330-helix in factor IXa and modeled this interaction. According to this model, electrostatic, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds contribute to forming this interface. In an attempt to determine the role of the 558-loop toward cofactor activity of factor VIIIa, Jenkins et al. (20.Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) expressed and purified selected B-domainless factor VIII variants with point mutations in this loop as defined from the hemophilia A data base. Functional assays showed that the mutations affected cofactor potential by altering the catalytic rate constant of factor IXa, however, affinity values of the factor VIII variants for factor IXa remained largely unchanged, likely due to the primary factor IXa-binding interactions involving the A3C1C2 subunit of the cofactor. In this study, we have investigated the contributions of residues 555–571 that border or are contained within the 558-loop region of factor VIIIa to inter-protein affinity and activity. To this end, we have reconstituted factor VIIIa and Xase complexes using baculovirus-expressed A2 domains (bA2), 2The abbreviations used are: bA2A2 subunit expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus constructPCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePSphosphatidylserineWTwild typeBHKbaby hamster kidneyMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidTEVtobacco etch virus. containing point mutations of each amino acid residue to Ala in the loop region, and A1/A3C1C2 dimer prepared from BHK cell-expressed factor VIIIa. The reconstituted complexes were evaluated for stabilization of A2 binding and Xa generating activity. With all the A2 variants we observed little or no change in Kd values within reconstituted factor VIIIa compared with that of the WT A2. However, we have identified several residues including Ser-558, Val-559, Asp-560, Gly-563, and Ile-566 where Ala replacement variants resulted in marked (>9-fold) increases in Kd within factor Xase complex, implicating a role for these residues in stabilizing A2 association with factor IXa. In addition, we have identified an overlapping set of residues including Tyr-555, Val-559, Asp-560, Gly-563, Ile-566, and Asp-569 whose Ala variants show >80% reduction in catalytic rates for factor Xa generation indicating a role for these residues in cofactor function.

Factor VIII was a kind gift from Lisa Regan of Bayer Corporation (Berkeley, CA). The plasmid xh-A2 (21.Sarafanov A.G. Makogonenko E.M. Pechik I.V. Radtke K.P. Khrenov A.V. Ananyeva N.M. Strickland D.K. Saenko E.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Andrey Sarafanov and Evgueni Saenko (University of Maryland). Factors IXa, X, and Xa were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, and the chromogenic substrate for factor Xa, Pefa-5523 (Pefachrome FXa) was purchased from Centerchem. Phospholipid vesicles containing 20% phosphatidylserine (PS), 40% phosphatidylcholine (PC), and 40% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were prepared using octyl glucoside as described previously (22.Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The A1/A3C1C2 dimer was purified by Mono S chromatography following activation of WT factor VIII by thrombin as described (23.Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The A2 domain-specific monoclonal antibody R8B12 was obtained from Green Mountain Antibodies (Burlington, VT). The plasmid xh-A2 was modified using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as follows. The Gly residue at position 374 of the A2 domain in xh-A2 was replaced with Val, the authentic residue at this position (24.Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F. Oppermann H. Keck R. Wood W.I. Harkins R.N. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R.M. Capon D.J. Nature. 1984; 312: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In addition, the factor Xa cleavage site in xh-A2 was deleted and a 7-amino acid AcTEV recognition site (Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Ser) for cleavage by TEV was introduced at the N terminus of the A2 open reading frame between the His6 tag and A2 sequence resulting in the plasmid designated pFastBac-wtA2. Cleavage of the TEV site occurs at the Gln-Ser bond and Ser was chosen for the seventh residue in the TEV site to be the first authentic N-terminal residue (residue 373) of the A2 domain. The His tag aided in purification of A2 and this tag was eliminated following cleavage by TEV to yield the WT A2 protein. Single alanine mutations were introduced in and around the 558-loop spanning residues 555 to 571 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Baculovirus expressed A2 (bA2) was prepared from Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). Optimal transduction conditions were determined as described (21.Sarafanov A.G. Makogonenko E.M. Pechik I.V. Radtke K.P. Khrenov A.V. Ananyeva N.M. Strickland D.K. Saenko E.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The expression of bA2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using the R8B12 antibody (25.Newell J.L. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11080-11089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The secreted bA2 proteins were purified from culture medium. The supernatant from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells expressing the bA2 protein was loaded onto a 5-ml heparin column, washed with Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20), bA2 was eluted with Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 800 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20), and fractions (1 ml) were collected. The fractions containing bA2 were determined using SDS-PAGE, pooled, and loaded onto a 1-ml Talon column that was pre-equilibrated with Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl). The Talon column was first washed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole followed by 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl. bA2 was eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole in 500-μl fractions. Fractions with bA2 were pooled based upon Bradford assay (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217486) Google Scholar) and an equal volume of Buffer C was added. The TEV tag was cleaved from the protein with addition of AcTEV protease (1 μl/30 μg of protein) for 2 h at 25 °C to ensure complete cleavage of the tag. Removal of the protease and concentration of bA2 was accomplished using an SP-Sepharose column (0.6 ml) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.01% Tween. The pooled protein was diluted 1:10 with the pre-equilibration buffer and loaded onto the column. The column was washed with Buffer A and bA2 was eluted with Buffer B in 200-μl fractions. The bA2 forms obtained were >90% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE. Fractions were pooled and concentrated using a MicroCon YM-10 (Millipore) as needed. The final concentrations were determined by Bradford assay and verified by running different amounts of the protein on SDS-PAGE gels with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The rate of conversion of factor X to Xa was determined by reconstituting factor Xase from purified A1/A3C1C2 (20 nm) and WT or variant bA2 (2–400 nm) in the presence of PS/PC/PE vesicles (10 μm) and limiting factor IXa (1 nm) by incubating the above components for 10 min at 25 °C. Alternatively, factor VIIIa was reconstituted by the addition of WT or variant bA2 (2–500 nm) to limiting A1/A3C1C2 (1 nm) for 10 min at 25 °C followed by addition of factor IXa (40 nm) and PS/PC/PE vesicles (10 μm) and further incubation for 1 min. Reactions were initiated with the addition of factor X (300 nm), and aliquots were removed at appropriate times to assess initial rates of product formation and added to tubes containing EDTA (50 mm final concentration) to stop the reaction. Affinity values (Kd) for A2 association in the Xase complex were obtained under limiting factor IXa conditions, whereas the Kd for A2 association in the factor VIIIa complex was obtained under limiting A1/A3C1C2 conditions. Rates of factor Xa generation were determined by the addition of the chromogenic substrate, Pefa-5523 (0.46 mm final concentration). Reactions were read at 405 nm for 5 min using a Vmax microtiter plate reader (GE Healthcare). To determine Ki(app) values, various concentrations (50–500 nm) of bA2 variants showing impaired rates of factor Xa generation and/or affinity for factor IXa were added to reactions containing WT bA2 (80 nm). Factor VIIIa and Xase complexes were reconstituted, and factor Xa generation was performed as described above. Inter-protein affinity (Kd) and activity (Vmax) parameters for factor Xa generation were calculated from initial rate data by fitting the data using non-linear least-squares regression analysis to a single site ligand binding model. A=Bmax[A2]/(Kd+[A2])(Eq. 1) Where A is activity of factor Xase (nm min−1 (nm factor IXa)−1) or factor VIIIa (nm min−1 (nm A1/A3-C1-C2)−1). [A2] is the A2 subunit concentration, Bmax is indicated by Vmax, the maximum velocity, and Kd is the dissociation constant for A2 in Xase or VIIIa. The inhibition constant (Ki) for bA2 variants was determined from data fitted globally using non-linear least squares regression analysis according to a competitive inhibition model. A=Vmax[A2]/[Kd(1+[I]/Ki)+[A2]](Eq. 2) Where [I] is the concentration of the variant bA2, [A2] is the concentration of WT bA2, Vmax is the maximum velocity for Xa generated, and Kd is the dissociation constant for WT-bA2 in factor Xase or VIIIa. The A2 subunit of factor VIIIa interacts with the protease domain of factor IXa and modulates its active site, yet contributes only fractionally to the binding energy of the proteins in complex. To study contributions of the A2 subunit to binding and functional interactions within factor Xase, we made two modifications, as described under “Materials and Methods,” to an existing baculovirus A2 domain construct for its expression in insect cells. The first involved replacing the factor Xa cleavage site that liberates the His6 tag from the A2 product with a site for TEV protease. This step was performed to ensure no residual factor Xa would carry over with purification of A2 inasmuch as this is the product of reaction catalyzed by factor Xase and could cloud experimental results. The second modification involved inserting the authentic residue (Gly at 374 to Val) from the A2 sequence near the N terminus of the A2. This was performed based on observations that the A2 subunit derived from the original construct showed ∼10% of the activity as WT A2 following reconstitution analyses (21.Sarafanov A.G. Makogonenko E.M. Pechik I.V. Radtke K.P. Khrenov A.V. Ananyeva N.M. Strickland D.K. Saenko E.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). WT and variant A2 subunits were expressed and purified using a baculovirus-directed construct from Sf9 cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” SDS-PAGE confirmed complete digestion of the TEV tag upon AcTEV protease treatment and >90% homogeneity was achieved for the purified bA2 proteins (Fig. 1). To evaluate the role of individual residues in and around the 558-loop in association within Xase, we individually mutated residues 555–571 that border or are contained within this loop region to Ala and expressed and purified the bA2 variants as described above. Analysis of WT and mutant bA2 forms used factor Xa generation assays following reconstitution of Xase using purified components. Reactions contained purified A1/A3C1C2 dimer (20 nm) from thrombin-treated BHK-factor VIII, limiting concentrations of factor IXa (1 nm), PS/PC/PE vesicles (10 μm), and the indicated concentrations of the individual bA2 subunits. Thus the bA2 subunit was the only varying component in Xase formation thereby eliminating any variability caused by differential activation of the procofactor forms. Reactions were initiated by addition of a Vmax concentration of factor X (300 nm). Because the amount of factor Xa generated is directly proportional to the concentration of reconstituted Xase, the concentration of A2 subunit required to yield maximal levels of factor Xa generation is an indicator of the affinity of the A2 subunit for Xase. Assays performed in the absence of bA2 did not generate detectable amounts of factor Xa (data not shown) indicating that A2 subunit is essential for cofactor activity. Factor Xase reconstituted with WT bA2 yielded similar affinity (Kd = 5.3 nm) and maximal activity (61.1 min−1 nm factor IXa−1) values to that formed using A2 subunit purified from thrombin-activated factor VIII purified from BHK cells (Kd = 4.8 nm; Vmax = 60.9 min−1 nm factor IXa−1) (Fig. 2 and Table 1). This result indicated that bA2 was functionally equivalent to the A2 subunit purified from factor VIII produced in mammalian cells in generating cofactor activity, and that the baculovirus-expressed reagent was an appropriate model for examining the role of the A2 subunit in Xase formation. Furthermore, reconstitution reactions run for 30 min with WT bA2 yielded equivalent activity and resulted in equivalent Kd values as reactions run for 10 min (data not shown), indicating the latter time was sufficient to achieve equilibrium.TABLE 1Kinetic and binding parameters for factor Xase and factor VIIIa reconstituted with WT A2 and 558-loop variantsA2 variantXase reconstitutionaReconstitution of factor Xase was performed using limiting factor IXa (1 nm).VIIIa reconstitutionbReconstitution of factor VIIIa was performed using limiting A1/A3C1C2 dimer (1 nm).KdVmaxKdVmaxnmnm Xa/min/nm IXanmnm Xa/min/nm A1/A3C1C2WT5.3 ± 0.361.1 ± 0.730.1 ± 2.257.9 ± 1.3FVIII-A24.8 ± 0.460.9 ± 0.822.4 ± 1.650.4 ± 2.3Y555A26.9 ± 1.52.9 ± 0.120.1 ± 1.52.1 ± 0.1K556A18.2 ± 1.429.9 ± 0.639.8 ± 4.140.1 ± 1.1E557A4.8 ± 0.626.1 ± 0.620.9 ± 2.335.0 ± 1.1S558A73.4 ± 5.544.0 ± 1.485.4 ± 4.235.9 ± 0.6V559A89.4 ± 9.911.9 ± 0.656.2 ± 13.03.5 ± 0.2D560A70.1 ± 10.710.7 ± 0.751.3 ± 7.210.1 ± 0.4D560K40.2 ± 5.11.5 ± 0.122.6 ± 5.03.5 ± 0.1Q561A21.4 ± 1.841.3 ± 1.251.8 ± 7.734.2 ± 1.4R562A9.9 ± 1.365.3 ± 2.321.1 ± 2.245.8 ± 1.3G563A75.8 ± 14.23.1 ± 0.226.4 ± 1.26.2 ± 0.1N564A10.6 ± 2.457.5 ± 3.617.6 ± 1.546.9 ± 1.0Q565A8.5 ± 1.082.1 ± 2.58.8 ± 0.865.1 ± 1.3I566A46.2 ± 2.63.4 ± 0.129.2 ± 2.812.5 ± 0.3M567A30.0 ± 2.139.2 ± 0.967.2 ± 3.922.3 ± 0.5S568A5.1 ± 0.831.9 ± 1.211.4 ± 1.625.9 ± 1.6D569A14.9 ± 3.01.6 ± 0.111.7 ± 1.72.5 ± 0.1K570A4.6 ± 0.423.1 ± 0.412.4 ± 2.240.5 ± 1.5R571A4.6 ± 0.334.9 ± 0.411.9 ± 1.523.9 ± 0.7a Reconstitution of factor Xase was performed using limiting factor IXa (1 nm).b Reconstitution of factor VIIIa was performed using limiting A1/A3C1C2 dimer (1 nm). Open table in a new tab Results showing rates of factor Xa generated as a function of A2 concentration for selected variants are shown in Fig. 2 with calculated parameter values shown in Table 1. Results for the remaining variants are not shown but parameter values are presented in Table 1. Mutations of residues Ser-558, Val-559, Asp-560, Gly-563, and Ile-566 to Ala resulted in ∼10–15-fold increases in Kd compared with WT, indicating a significant contribution of these residues toward A2 association within Xase (see Fig. 2b and Table 1). Furthermore, Ala variants of residues Tyr-555, Val-559, Asp-560, Gly-563, Ile-566, and Asp-569 yielded about 5–40-fold reductions in rates of factor Xa generated suggesting that these mutations variably impaired cofactor function. Among these, Y555A and D569A showed only moderate increases (3–5-fold) in Kd suggesting that these residues act predominantly by modulating the cofactor activity and play a modest role in association of the A2 subunit with factor IXa in Xase. Alternatively, variants K556A, Q561A, and M567A showed modest increases (3–5-fold) compared with WT in the Kd for A2 with little effect on factor Xa generation rates (Table 1) indicating that these residues contribute marginally to the association of A2 within Xase and show no apparent involvement in cofactor function. The variants E557A, S568A, K570A, and R571A exhibited similar Kd values to WT bA2, whereas rates for factor Xa generation were lower by ∼2-fold, suggesting a modest role for these residues in cofactor function but not in binding interactions. Finally, similar affinity and activity parameters to WT bA2 observed for Ala variants for residues Arg-562, Asn-564, and Gln-565 indicated that these residues do not appear to play a significant role in the interactions of the 558-loop residues regarding cofactor binding or function. Asp-560, a charged residue contained within the 558-loop, demonstrated a key role in both A2 association and cofactor activity of factor VIIIa within the Xase complex, as indicated by significant reductions in affinity and activity parameters upon mutation to Ala. To gain additional insights into the role of this residue, we tested the effect of charge reversal (Asp to Lys) on affinity and rate parameters. Reconstitution of Xase using the D560K A2 variant did not significantly alter the affinity of A2 with FIXa (Kd = 40.1 nm) relative to the D560A mutation (Kd = 70.3 nm) where the negative charge was neutralized (Fig. 2b). However, the charge reversal at this site decreased the rate of Xa generation by a further ∼10-fold compared with the observed rate for Xase formed with D560A A2 (∼40-fold relative to the WT bA2), suggesting that the Asp residue at this position modulates cofactor activity through a negative electrostatic interaction. Affinity values for A2 variants in factor VIIIa were determined to compare the contribution of 558-loop residues toward intersubunit interactions in the cofactor with the stabilization of A2 conferred by Xase. In this series of experiments, factor VIIIa was reconstituted with various concentrations of bA2 (2 nm-500 nm) and limiting A1/A3C1C2 dimer (1 nm). Association of A2 subunit within factor VIIIa was analyzed by generation of factor Xa following the addition PS/PC/PE vesicles (10 μm) and an excess of factor IXa relative to dimer (40 nm), and reactions were initiated using a Vmax concentration of factor X (300 nm). The amount of factor Xa generated in this case is directly proportional to the level of reconstituted factor VIIIa (Fig. 3) and was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The affinity for WT bA2 within reconstituted factor VIIIa (Kd = 30.1 nm) was found to be similar to that observed for A2 purified from BHK-expressed factor VIII (22.4 nm) (see Table 1) confirming that Sf9 purified WT bA2 functions similarly to the BHK cell-derived A2 subunit with respect to its intersubunit interactions within the cofactor. Reconstitution reactions run for 30 min with WT bA2 yielded equivalent activity and resulted in equivalent Kd values as reactions run for 10 min (data not shown). Furthermore, the Kd for A2 in factor VIIIa was about 6-fold higher relative to that within the factor Xase complex. This observation is consistent with results from previous studies showing that interaction with factor IXa partially stabilizes association of the A2 subunit (11.Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Fay P.J. Beattie T.L. Regan L.M. O'Brien L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6027-6032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This effect was further verified by modifying the factor VIIIa reconstitution assay using WT bA2 to decrease or increase the duration of reaction of the reconstituted factor VIIIa with factor IXa prior to reaction with factor X. Reduction of the standard reaction time from 1 min to 30 s yielded a modest increase (∼25%) in Kd, whereas increasing this reaction time to 20 min yielded a >3-fold reduction in this value (results not shown). These observations were consistent with the extended contact time with IXa allowing for a re-equilibration of reactants to approach the affinity value obtained with A2 for Xase. Mutation of individual residues to Ala within and around the 558-loop resulted in no or a modest change on Kd values for inter-subunit interactions in factor VIIIa (see Fig. 3 for selected variants and Table 1). Interestingly, variants S558A and Q565A that form the extremities of the 558-loop structure exhibited a modest (∼3-fold) increase and decrease, respectively, in Kd for A2 interaction within factor VIIIa as compared with WT (Fig. 3a). These observations suggested that these resid"

We had previously shown that the basic helix-loop-helix protein E47 binds to E-box sequences within the promoter of the TrkB gene and activates its transcription. Proper expression of the TrkB receptor plays a key role in development and function of the vertebrate nervous system, and altered levels of TrkB have been associated with important human diseases. Here we show that E47 interacts with MLK2, a mixed lineage kinase (MLK) involved in JNK-mediated activation of programmed cell death. MLK2 enhances phosphorylation of the AD2 activation domain of E47 in vivo in a JNK-independent manner and phosphorylates in vitro defined serine and threonine residues within a loop-helix structure of AD2 that also contains a putative MLK docking site. Although these residues are essential for MLK2-mediated inactivation of E47, inhibition of MLKs by CEP11004 causes up-regulation of TrkB at a transcriptional level in cerebellar granule neurons and differentiating neuroblastoma cells. These findings allow us to propose a novel mechanism by which MLK regulates TrkB expression through phosphorylation of an activation domain of E47. This molecular link would explain why MLK inhibitors not only prevent activation of cell death processes but also enhance cell survival signaling as a key aspect of their neuroprotective potential.

Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). For instance, NeuroD and MyoD are tissue-specific bHLH proteins involved in neurogenesis and myogenesis, respectively (2.Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 3.Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). These tissue-specific proteins form dimers with other ubiquitously expressed bHLH transcription factors called E proteins, which bind to the canonical E-box sequence CANNTG and include HEB, E2–2, and the E2A gene products E12 and E47 (1.Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The formation of active heterodimers can be inhibited by overexpression of Id family members, which bind to and sequester E2A proteins into transcriptionally nonfunctional complexes (4.Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two activation domains within E12 and E47 proteins: AD1, which is found between amino acids 1 and 99 (5.Aronheim A. Shiran R. Rosen A. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8063-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6.Massari M.E. Jennings P.A. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and AD2, which is between amino acids 325 and 432 (7.Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The AD2 domain contains a region between amino acids 345 and 408 consisting of a loop adjacent to an amphipathic α-helix, the loop-helix (LH) motif, which is conserved in yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells (7.Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). c-Jun specifically represses the activity of the LH domain, and the selective recognition by c-Jun of this activation domain in pancreatic β cells suggests an important function of E2A proteins in regulating insulin control element-mediated expression (8.Robinson G.L. Henderson E. Massari M.E. Murre C. Stein R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, E2A transcriptional activity can be modulated by phosphorylation at different levels. It has been reported that phosphorylation status of E47 alters the DNA binding ability of E47 as homodimers or heterodimers in different cellular contexts (9.Sloan S.R. Shen C.P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10.Johnson S.E. Wang X. Hardy S. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol.

Cell. 2004; 7: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, p38 MAPK has been described to phosphorylate E47 at Ser140 and promote MyoD/E47 association and muscle-specific gene transcription (12.Lluís F. Ballestar E. Suelves M. Esteller M. Muñoz-Cánoves P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has also been observed that MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1) signaling through p38 leads to transcriptional inactivation of E47 (13.Page J.L. Wang X. Sordillo L.M. Johnson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30966-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, Ser/Thr kinases 3pK and MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 have been shown to interact with E47 and repress its transcriptional activity (14.Neufeld B. Grosse-Wilde A. Hoffmeyer A.

Finally, E47 proteasomal degradation is associated with increased ERK MAPK activity in aged B cell precursors (15.Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.H.

MLKs are a family of serine/threonine kinases, all of which act as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (17.Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The name “mixed lineage kinases” derives from the fact that of the 11 conserved subdomains found in all protein kinases, domains 1–8 of the MLK proteins resemble serine/threonine kinases, whereas regions 9–11 share sequence similarity with those of tyrosine kinases, such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor and Src (17.Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 18.Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Biochem.

Eight mammalian MLKs have been identified and categorized into three subfamilies on the basis of domain organization and sequence similarity: MLKs, dual leucine zipper-bearing kinases (DLKs), and zipper sterile α-motif kinases (ZAKs). However, MLK2, MLK3, DLK, and leucine zipper kinase (LZK) are the only MLKs that have been studied in any detail at a biochemical level (20.Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21.Ing Y.L. Leung I.W. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Lassam N.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1745-1750PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Sakuma H. Ikeda A. Oka S. Kozutsumi Y. Zanetta J.P. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28622-28629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although MLK3 and LZK are expressed widely, MLK2 and DLK are restricted to brain. MLK1–4 share a high degree of homology in the N-terminal 500 amino acids, which incorporate several functional domains: an SH3 domain, a kinase catalytic domain, two leucine zippers, a proline-rich region, and the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain, which mediates binding to GTP-bound Cdc42 and Rac. In contrast to the N-terminal portion of these proteins, the C termini share little homology and vary greatly in size, possibly to mediate specificity and orchestrate interactions with various other proteins. MLKs are considered primarily as kinases that act upstream of JNKs. Nonetheless, mammalian MLK3 is localized to the centrosome, and its activity is enhanced during G2/M phase transition, when the JNK pathway remains inactive (23.Swenson K.I. Winkler K.E. Means A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 156-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been reported that silencing MLK3 can block mitogen-stimulated B-Raf activation and prevent serum- or Ki-Ras-stimulated cell proliferation (24.Chadee D.N. Kyriakis J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, MLK2 has been involved in modulation of NeuroD and Alien transcription factors (25.Marcora E. Gowan K. Lee J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9578-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26.Eckey M. Tenbaum S.P. Muñoz A. Baniahmad A. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2003; 213: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, MLKs may be involved in very different processes depending on the particular molecular context. Little is known about the molecular effectors of MLK activity in response to external or internal inputs, but the available evidence suggests that the activity of MLK proteins is controlled by phosphorylation (27.Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1961-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of all MLK proteins is their ability to dimerize, and MLK3 autophosphorylates following homodimerization (27.Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1961-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) via a mechanism analogous to that of receptor tyrosine kinases (with which MLKs share some sequence homology). Activation of MLK3 by Cdc42 and Rac has been shown to be a pathway for JNK activation by these G-proteins (28.Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Two Cdc42-inducible autophosphorylation sites in MLK3 have been identified, but it is unclear how Cdc42 induces MLK3 phosphorylation. One speculation was that the association of the CRIB domain with a GTP-bound G-protein would displace an intramolecular SH3-mediated interaction and permit homodimerization via the leucine zipper and autophosphorylation. The activation of the JNK pathway is critical for the naturally occurring neuronal cell death in development and may be important in the pathological neuronal cell death of neurodegenerative diseases. The small molecule MLK inhibitors CEP1347 and CEP11004 prevent the activation of the JNK pathway and consequently reduce neuronal cell death in many cell culture and animal models (29.Wang L.H. Besirli C.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 451-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, the cell death program induced by nerve growth factor deprivation in sympathetic neurons is inhibited by MLK inhibitors as a direct consequence of inhibiting downstream kinases of the JNK pathway such as MKK4 and JNK and JNK-activated transcription factors such as c-Jun (30.Maroney A.C. Glicksman M.A. Basma A.N. Walton K.M. Knight Jr., E. Murphy C.A. Bartlett B.A. Finn J.P. Angeles T. Matsuda Y. Neff N.T. Dionne C.A. J.

Intriguingly, it has been reported that MLK inhibition by CEP11004 increases TrkB protein levels in cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (32.Wang L.H. Paden A.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 1007-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because TrkB is a key tyrosine receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor involved in differentiation and survival in the nervous system (33.Lei L. Parada L.F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), MLK inhibitors would also up-regulate cell survival circuits. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that E47 and NeuroD bHLH proteins bind to p21CIP1 and TrkB promoters linking differentiation and cell cycle arrest in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (34.Liu Y. Encinas M. Comella J.X. Aldea M. Gallego C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2662-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study we show that MLK2 binds to and phosphorylates E47 at the AD2 transactivation domain and, as a consequence, represses TrkB promoter activity. Our results provide a molecular link that explains why MLK inhibition not only prevents activation of cell death processes but also enhances cell survival signaling. Plasmids pCMV-E47 (35.Funato N. Ohtani K. Ohyama K. Kuroda T. Nakamura M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7416-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and SRD-MLK2 (36.Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A.

MLK2 was tagged at its N terminus with a triple FLAG epitope and subcloned under the cytomegalovirus promoter to produce pCYC573, where several derivatives containing different fragments from MLK2 were obtained: pCYC833 (1–364 aa), pCYC843 (1–496 aa), pCYC844 (1–757 aa), and pCYC716 (327–954 aa). A K125A mutation was introduced to obtain a kinase-dead MLK2 mutant in pCYC742 using XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A tandem affinity purification (TAP)-E47 fusion under the cytomegalovirus promoter (pCYC304) was also used to obtain derivatives with different fragments of E47: pCYC306 (1–220 aa), pCYC831 (221–330 aa), pCYC830 (331–400 aa), pCYC925 (331–460 aa), pCYC305 (1–540 aa), pCYC 307 (100–540 aa), and pCYC308 (100–490 aa). Point mutations within full-length E47 produced plasmids pCYC805 (S379A), pCYC899 (S352A/T355A/S359A/S379A, referred to as S/T4A), and pCYC920 (S341A/S352A/T355A/S359A/S379A, referred to as S/T5A). Point mutations within TAP-tagged E47 peptides produced plasmids pCYC836 (S341A), pCYC837 (S352A, T355A, S359A), pCYC838 (S379A), and pCYC926 (S/T5A) pGEX-KG (GE Life Sciences) derivatives containing GST fusions to E47 peptides were pCYC907 (331–460 aa) and pCYC903 (361–460 aa), and corresponding S/T5A (S341A/S352A/T355A/S359A/S379A) and S379A derivatives were pCYC921 and pCYC905, respectively. N-terminal (1–496 aa) wild-type and kinase-dead (K125A) MLK2 fusions to GST produced pCYC846 and pCYC848, respectively. The TrkB luciferase reporter construct (pCYC219) carries a 1.9-kb fragment from positions −1888 to +30 nucleotides relative to the main transcription start site of human TrkB promoter inserted into pGL3b (Promega). SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), HEK293T cells, and GP2–293T cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 units/ml penicillin, 20 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). To induce cell cycle arrest and differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA; Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm for 5 days. The medium was changed every 3 days. MEFs and SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and HEK293T and GP2–293T were transfected with polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich), following standard protocols. Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from postnatal day 7 Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described previously (32.Wang L.H. Paden A.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 1007-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were dissociated by 1 mg/ml trypsin for 15 min prior to mechanical trituration, plated in poly-l-lysine-coated dishes at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml and maintained in basal Eagle's medium with 25 mm KCl, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Aphidicolin (3.3 μg/ml) was added 1 day later to reduce the number of non-neuronal cells. The MLK inhibitor CEP-11004 was kindly provided by Cephalon, Inc. (West Chester, PA). Stocks solutions of CEP-11004 (4 mm) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide, and a working 40 μm solution was prepared in 1% bovine serum albumin/basal Eagle's medium on the day of the experiment. TAP-tagged N-terminal (1–220 aa) or C-terminal (100–651 aa) human E47 fragments or TAP control cDNAs were cloned into a retroviral expression vector (pBABE-puro) to obtain pCYC313, pCYC315 and pCYC316, respectively. Retroviruses were produced in GP2–293T packaging cells by transfection of pBABE-puro derivatives and helper pVSV-G. The cells were maintained at 32 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Supernatant containing viruses was recovered after 48, 72, and 96 h, filtered (0.45 μm), and used for SH-SY5Y infection with the addition of 5 μg/ml polybrene. After 2 days, the medium was removed, and infected cells were selected with 0.25 μg/ml puromycin. A pBABE-puro derivative expressing green fluorescent protein (pCYC186) was used to estimate infection efficiencies. Ten 150-mm plates (8 × 106 cells seeded), and twenty 150-mm plates (5 × 106 cells seeded) were used for TAP experiments with proliferating or RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, respectively. The cells were lysed in TNT buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT) with 2 mm MgCl2 and protease and phosphatase inhibitors and centrifuged for 3 min at 200 × g. Triton X-100 was raised to 1% whenever the large C-terminal fragment of E47 was used. Obtained supernatants were first used for immunoprecipitation with 100 μl of IgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. After five washes, 300 units/ml AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) was added to the column, which was incubated for 2 h at room temperature to elute E47 in TNT buffer with 0.5 mm EDTA. The second immunoprecipitation was carried out with calmodulin beads (Stratagene) in TNT buffer with 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, and 2 mm CaCl2. After five washes, calmodulin beads were suspended in 50 mm NH4CO3H, pH 8, and proteins were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to nano-electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with E47 and MLK2 expression plasmids in 60-mm plates. One day after transfection, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors; sonicated on ice; and spun for 10 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatant was divided into 50-μl aliquots and treated with 4 units of SAP (shrimp alkaline phosphatase; Roche Applied Science) or 400 units of λ protein phosphatase (NEB) as directed by the supplier. Phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EGTA) were added when indicated. The samples were incubated 90 min at 37 °C (SAP) or 30 °C (λ phosphatase). To stop the reaction, 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added, and the samples were analyzed by Western blot. For immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK293T cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors), sonicated on ice, and spun for 10 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of αFLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). The samples were rocked for 2 h at 4 °C, and the beads were collected by centrifugation (1 min at 2000 × g), washed three times with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer, and finally resuspended in loading buffer, boiled, and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (34.Liu Y. Encinas M. Comella J.X. Aldea M. Gallego C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2662-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with αE47 (SC-763), αFLAG (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-α-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), αpS63-c-Jun (Cell Signaling), and αJNK (Cell Signaling) antibodies used as recommended by the suppliers. Luciferase were performed essentially as described (34.Liu Y. Encinas M. Comella J.X. Aldea M. Gallego C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2662-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Routinely, 1 μg of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.05 μg of Renilla luciferase pRL-TK control plasmid (Promega) were used to determine relative expression values. To assess effects caused by E47 or MLK2, 0.8 or 0.2 μg of each expression plasmid (or empty vector) were added to each transfection assay. Firefly/Renilla luciferase ratios obtained from a promoterless vector were substracted as background, and the resulting values were normalized to control conditions. All of the GST fusions were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to cultures at a cell density of 0.3 A600 and subsequent incubation for 4 h at 30 °C. The proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads as directed by the supplier (Amersham Biosciences) in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.3 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. Elution buffer contained 40 mm reduced glutathione, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Kinase reactions were carried out in 20 μl (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors) containing 25 μm nonradioactive ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.2 μg of GST-MLK2 (or GST-MLK2 KD), and 2 μg of the corresponding substrate proteins and were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated products were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to ensure equal loading of substrate proteins and MLK2 kinase, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. RNA was extracted (RNeasy kit; Qiagen), treated with DNaseI (Qiagen), and reverse transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Relative mRNA levels were determined by quantitative real time PCR using TaqMan probes from Applied Biosystems, TrkB (Hs 001778811_m1), and transferrin receptor (TFRC) (4333770F) for SH-SY5Y cells, TrkB 5′(Rn 01441749), TrkB 3′ (Rn 00820626), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Rn 01749022_g1) for cerebellar granule neurons. PCRs were run and analyzed with an iCycler iQ real time detection system (Bio-Rad). To identify neuronal proteins that interact with transcriptional complexes containing E47, we carried out TAP experiments using E47 as bait in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells either proliferating or undergoing differentiation with RA (37.Encinas M. Iglesias M. Liu Y. Wang H. Muhaisen A. Ceña V. Gallego C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were infected with retroviral vectors expressing TAP-tagged human N-terminal (1–220 aa) or C-terminal (100–651 aa) E47 moieties and subsequently selected by puromycin treatment. Purified E47-TAP complexes were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to nano-electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. One of the identified peptides specifically present in the N-terminal E47-TAP pulldown was matched to MLK2, one of the mixed lineage kinases that had been initially identified as signaling effectors in the nervous system (17.Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 38.Silva R.M. Kuan C.Y. Rakic P. Burke R.E. Mov.

Immunol. 2007; 13: 923-933Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To confirm and analyze further the interaction between E47 and MLK2, HEK293T cells were transfected with full-length E47 and different FLAG-tagged MLK2 constructs (Fig. 1A), and corresponding cell extracts were used for immunoprecipitation experiments with αFLAG beads. Although the interaction of E47 with full-length FLAG-MLK2 was readily detected (Fig. 1B), the co-immunoprecipitation efficiency decreased significantly when only the C-terminal moiety of MLK2 was used, suggesting that the interacting region would lie in the N-terminal sequences of MLK2 that include the SH3 motif and the kinase domain. In agreement with this, the N-terminal region of MLK2 was sufficient to co-immunoprecipitate E47 at a similar relative efficiency compared with full-length MLK2. Finally, supporting a key role for the kinase activity of MLK2, a kinase-dead mutant of MLK2 was unable to co-immunoprecipitate E47 (Fig. 1B). Because MLKs undergo autophosphorylation to become fully active (17.Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 19.Handley M.E. Rasaiyaah J. Chain B.M. Katz D.R. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2007; 88: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), this result suggests that autophosphorylation might also be important to acquire a competent conformation to interact with E47. NeuroD overexpression did not affect co-immunoprecipitation of E47 and FLAG-MLK2, suggesting that NeuroD would not mediate their interaction (25.Marcora E. Gowan K. Lee J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9578-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Indeed, MLK2 requires its LZ domain to interact with NeuroD (25.Marcora E. Gowan K. Lee J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9578-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although it is not involved in its interaction with E47 (Fig. 1B). A shift in the mobility of E47 was visible by Western blot of HEK293T cell extracts when wild-type MLK2, but not the kinase-dead mutant (KD), was co-expressed (Fig. 1B). Because MLK2 has been shown to be constitutively active when overexpressed (36.Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), our observations would suggest that MLK2 phosphorylates E47, either directly or indirectly. The retarded E47 bands caused by MLK2 co-expression collapsed into a faster migrating band after treatment of cell extracts with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that MLK2 enhances phosphorylation of E47. Moreover, treatment of cell extracts with λ protein phosphatase also revealed a basal phosphorylation status for E47 in HEK293T cells, which likely reflects the demonstrated participation of other kinases in E47 phosphorylation (9.Sloan S.R.

https://openalex.org/W2047567520,"Mast cells (MCs) play a critical role in innate and adaptive immunity through the release of cytokines, chemokines, lipid mediators, biogenic amines, and proteases. We recently showed that the activities of MC proteases are transcriptionally regulated by intracellularly retained interleukin-15 (IL-15), and we provided evidence that this cytokine acts as a specific regulator of mouse mast cell protease-2 (mMCP-2). Here, we show that in wild-type bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) IL-15 inhibits mMCP-2 transcription indirectly by inducing differential expression and mMCP-2 promoter binding of the bifunctional transcription factors C/EBPbeta and YY1. In wild-type BMMCs, C/EBPbeta expression predominates over YY1 expression, and thus C/EBPbeta preferentially binds to the mMCP-2 promoter. In IL-15-deficient BMMCs, the opposite is found: YY1 expression predominates and binds to the mMCP-2 promoter at the expense of C/EBPbeta. Hypertranscription of the mMCP-2 gene in IL-15-deficient BMMCs is associated with histone acetylation and, intriguingly, with methylation of non-CpG dinucleotides within the MCP-2 promoter. This suggests a novel model of cytokine-controlled protease transcription: non-CpG methylation maintains a chromosomal domain in an ""open"" configuration that is permissive for gene expression."

Degradation of 4-ML has only been described in few bacterial species, including Pseudomonas reinekei MT1. The isomerization of 4-ML to 3-methylmuconolactone (3-ML) is the first step required for the mineralization of 4-ML and is catalyzed by an enzyme termed 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase (MLMI). We identified the gene encoding MLMI in P. reinekei MT1 and solved the crystal structures of MLMI in complex with 3-ML at 1.4-Å resolution, with 4-ML at 1.9-Å resolution and with a MES buffer molecule at 1.45-Å resolution. MLMI exhibits a ferredoxin-like fold and assembles as a tight functional homodimeric complex. We were able to assign the active site clefts of MLMI from P. reinekei MT1 and of the homologous MLMI from Cupriavidus necator JMP134, which has previously been crystallized in a structural genomics project. Kinetic and structural analysis of wild-type MLMI and variants created by site-directed mutagenesis indicate Tyr-39 and His-26 to be the most probable catalytic residues.

Microorganisms have developed the ability to use these abundant compounds as carbon and energy sources. One example is Pseudomonas reinekei MT1, which can use both methyl- and chloro-substituted aromatics as its only carbon source.P. reinekei MT1 has been described to use uncommon routes to degrade these substances (1.Cámara B.

J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6790-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although most other bacteria degrade methyl-substituted aromatics via meta (extradiol)-cleavage of methylcatechols, this strain specializes in the degradation of such compounds via ortho (intradiol)-cleavage (1.Cámara B.

Ortho-cleavage of 4-methylcatechol typically results in the formation of 4-methylmuconolactone (4-ML) 2The abbreviations used are: 4-ML4-methylmuconolactone3-ML3-methylmuconolactoneMLMI4-methylmuconolactone methylisomeraseMMLImethylmuconolactone isomerase1MES2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonatepCMBp-chloromercuribenzoate1-methylbislactone1-methyl-3,7-dioxo-2,6-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane. as a dead-end product (1.Cámara B.

Microbiol. 1976; 2: 267-276Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar).This molecule cannot be mineralized by downstream enzymes of the ortho-cleavage pathway (3-oxoadipate pathway) as the subsequent step requires the abstraction of a proton from the C4 carbon atom (5.Chari R. Whitman C. Kozarich J. Ngai K. Ornston L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 5520-5521Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transformation of 4-ML to 3-ML generates such a proton at the C4 carbon atom. This isomerization step is performed by an enzyme termed 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase (MLMI) (Fig. 1), which is not part of the 3-oxoadipate pathway. MLMI activity has previously only been described in Cupriavidus necator JMP134 and Rhodococcus rhodochrous N75 (6.Pieper D.H. Stadler-Fritzsche K. Knackmuss H.J. Engesser K.H. Bruce N.C. Cain R.B.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1664-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).An analysis of the catalytic activity of MLMI from C. necator JMP134 and R. rhodochrous N75 has shown that, besides 4-ML, both enzymes are able to transform 1-methylbislactone to 3-ML. This indicates that the enzymes catalyze lactone ring formation and opening, rather than a migration of the methyl substituent. Based on its rapid transformation, the bislactone has also been discussed as a possible intermediate of the isomerization of 4-ML to 3-ML (6.Pieper D.H. Stadler-Fritzsche K. Knackmuss H.J.

J. 1989; 262: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The occurrence of an enzyme-bound intermediate has been addressed as well, supported by the finding that MLMI activity is sensitive to heavy metals and thiol reagents (6.Pieper D.H.

To reveal the details of the catalytic mechanism, information regarding the active site architecture in the context of substrate/product binding is crucial. The crystal structure of JMP134 MLMI is available from a structure genome project (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 2ifx). However, no active site was assigned, and no catalytic mechanism has been deduced from the data.In this work we present the identification, crystallization, and characterization of MLMI from P. reinekei MT1. We solved crystal structures of different MLMI variants in complex with different ligands to elucidate the enzymatic mechanism of this enzyme. Considering these structures, we were able to assign the active site cleft of MLMI and pinpoint the residues important for substrate binding and catalysis. Based upon these data, we propose a mechanism for the isomerization catalyzed by MLMI, which is crucial for bacterial growth on methyl-substituted aromatics via ortho-cleavage of 4-methylcatechol. IntroductionAromatic compounds are among the most widely distributed organic substances in nature. Microorganisms have developed the ability to use these abundant compounds as carbon and energy sources. One example is Pseudomonas reinekei MT1, which can use both methyl- and chloro-substituted aromatics as its only carbon source.P. reinekei MT1 has been described to use uncommon routes to degrade these substances (1.Cámara B. Bielecki P. Kaminski F. dos Santos V.M. Plumeier I. Nikodem P. Pieper D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1664-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2.Nikodem P. Hecht V. Schlömann M. Pieper D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6790-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although most other bacteria degrade methyl-substituted aromatics via meta (extradiol)-cleavage of methylcatechols, this strain specializes in the degradation of such compounds via ortho (intradiol)-cleavage (1.Cámara B. Bielecki P. Kaminski F. dos Santos V.M. Plumeier I. Nikodem P. Pieper D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1664-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ortho-cleavage of 4-methylcatechol typically results in the formation of 4-methylmuconolactone (4-ML) 2The abbreviations used are: 4-ML4-methylmuconolactone3-ML3-methylmuconolactoneMLMI4-methylmuconolactone methylisomeraseMMLImethylmuconolactone isomerase1MES2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonatepCMBp-chloromercuribenzoate1-methylbislactone1-methyl-3,7-dioxo-2,6-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane. as a dead-end product (1.Cámara B. Bielecki P. Kaminski F. dos Santos V.M. Plumeier I. Nikodem P. Pieper D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1664-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3.Catelani D. Fiecchi A. Galli E. Biochem.

Microbiol. 1976; 2: 267-276Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar).This molecule cannot be mineralized by downstream enzymes of the ortho-cleavage pathway (3-oxoadipate pathway) as the subsequent step requires the abstraction of a proton from the C4 carbon atom (5.Chari R. Whitman C. Kozarich J. Ngai K. Ornston L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 5520-5521Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transformation of 4-ML to 3-ML generates such a proton at the C4 carbon atom. This isomerization step is performed by an enzyme termed 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase (MLMI) (Fig. 1), which is not part of the 3-oxoadipate pathway. MLMI activity has previously only been described in Cupriavidus necator JMP134 and Rhodococcus rhodochrous N75 (6.Pieper D.H. Stadler-Fritzsche K. Knackmuss H.J. Engesser K.H. Bruce N.C. Cain R.B.

The encoding gene has been localized in the genome of C. necator JMP134 (GenBank™ accession numbers: AAZ60870 and CAA67958) (8.Erb R.W. Timmis K.N. Pieper D.H. Gene. 1998; 206: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and a putative MLMI encoding gene has been localized on plasmid pHG1 of C. necator H16 (GenBank™ accession number: AAP86134). P. reinekei MT1 also contains MLMI-like activity for the isomerization of 4-ML, as recently shown by Camara et al. (1.Cámara B. Bielecki P. Kaminski F. dos Santos V.M. Plumeier I. Nikodem P.
