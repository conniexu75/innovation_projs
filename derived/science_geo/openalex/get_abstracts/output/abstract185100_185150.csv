While matrix metalloproteinases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and cytokines play a major role in invasion and angiogenesis, chemokines such as stromal derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) and their receptors such as CXCR4 are thought to play a critical role in motility, homing, and proliferation of cancer cells at specific metastatic sites. We and others have previously reported that the extracellular signal-activated transcription factor NF-κB up-regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and cytokines in highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines. In this report, we demonstrate that NF-κB regulates the motility of breast cancer cells by directly up-regulating the expression of CXCR4. Overexpression of the inhibitor of κB (IκB) in breast cancer cells with constitutive NF-κB activity resulted in reduced expression of CXCR4 and a corresponding loss of SDF-1α-mediated migration in vitro. Introduction of CXCR4 cDNA into IκB-expressing cells restored SDF-1α-mediated migration. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays revealed that the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 bind directly to sequences within the –66 to +7 region of the CXCR4 promoter and activate transcription. We also show that the cell surface expression of CXCR4 and the SDF-1α-mediated migration are enhanced in breast cancer cells isolated from mammary fat pad xenografts compared with parental cells grown in culture. A further increase in CXCR4 cell surface expression and SDF-1α-mediated migration was observed with cancer cells that metastasized to the lungs. Taken together, these results implicate NF-κB in the migration and the organ-specific homing of metastatic breast cancer cells.

Taken together, these results implicate NF-κB in the migration and the organ-specific homing of metastatic breast cancer cells. Morbidity and mortality in cancer are mainly due to organ-specific metastasis and the failure of chemotherapeutic drugs to selectively kill cancer cells at the sites of metastasis. Metastasis is a non-random process, and each cancer type has its own preferred sites of metastasis (1Liotta L.A. Nature. 2001; 410: 24-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For example, breast cancer cells preferentially metastasize to the regional lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bone (1Liotta L.A. Nature. 2001; 410: 24-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2Nicolson G.L. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 325-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Prostate cancers usually metastasize to bone. While there has been considerable progress in identifying genes that promote the metastasis of cancer cells, little is known about the genes that enable cancer cells to seed, survive, and proliferate at sites of metastasis. Three models of organ-specific metastasis are currently under consideration: 1) selective survival and proliferation of cancer cells in a particular organ due to local production of appropriate growth factors, 2) organ-specific endothelial cells trapping circulating tumor cells by expressing appropriate adhesion molecules on their surface, and 3) organ-specific attractant molecules helping in homing cancer cells to specific sites (3Moore M.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). While data supporting the first two models are still scanty, a recent study provided evidence supporting the third model. Muller et al. (4Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4387) Google Scholar) demonstrated that metastatic breast cancer cells overexpress the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Additionally sites to which breast cancer cells metastasize express abundant amounts of stromal derived factor-1α (SDF-1α, 1The abbreviations used are: SDF-1α, stromal derived factor-1α; CXCR, CXC chemokine receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitor of κB; IκBαSR, IκBα super-repressor; IL, interleukin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; IKK, IκB kinase complex; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; β-gal, β-galactosidase; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein; TRPM-2, testosterone-repressed prostatic message-2; SP-1, specificity protein-1; BLR, Burkitt's lymphoma receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.1The abbreviations used are: SDF-1α, stromal derived factor-1α; CXCR, CXC chemokine receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitor of κB; IκBαSR, IκBα super-repressor; IL, interleukin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; IKK, IκB kinase complex; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; β-gal, β-galactosidase; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein; TRPM-2, testosterone-repressed prostatic message-2; SP-1, specificity protein-1; BLR, Burkitt's lymphoma receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. recently renamed CXCL12), the ligand for CXCR4. Moreover antibodies against CXCR4 significantly inhibited lymph node and lung metastasis in xenograft models of breast cancer. These results suggest that SDF-1α serves as a homing factor for cancer cells and that the signaling pathways activated upon interaction of CXCR4 with SDF-1α play a role in the survival and proliferation of cancer cells once they are localized in a specific organ. The transcription factors that regulate CXCR4 expression in breast cancer cells are currently unknown. We considered the possibility that the extracellular signal-activated transcription factor NF-κB is involved in the expression of CXCR4 because NF-κB has been shown to up-regulate the expression of several prometastatic and proangiogenic genes including interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor (5Baeuerle P.A.

In addition, inhibitors of NF-κB have been shown to reduce metastasis in xenograft models (9Andela V.B. Schwarz E.M. Puzas J.E. O'Keefe R.J. Rosier R.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6557-6562PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB is a heterodimeric complex of Rel family proteins that is physically confined to the cytoplasm of normal cells through its interaction with inhibitor of κB (IκB) proteins (6Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). A heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 subunits is the predominant form of NF-κB, although several other cell type-specific heterodimers have been identified. Upon exposure of cells to growth factors and cytokines such as epidermal growth factor, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor α, a series of signaling events target IκB for degradation, promoting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. NF-κB binds to its response elements (5′-GGGPuNNNPyPyCC-3′ where Pu is a purine and Py is a pyrimidine) in the promoter region of target genes and activates transcription (5Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). CXCR4 may be one of the NF-κB target genes as a putative NF-κB binding site (5′-GAGGCATTTCC-3′, –230 to –240) is present in the promoter region of CXCR4 (10Caruz A. Samsom M. Alonso J.M. Alcami J. Baleux F. Virelizier J.L. Parmentier M. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Several laboratories, including ours, have demonstrated constitutive activation of NF-κB in a variety of cancers (11Bargou R.C. Emmerich F. Krappmann D. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Arnold W. Royer H.D.

We have shown that constitutively active NF-κB is responsible for overexpression of prometastatic and antiapoptotic genes in breast cancer cells (14Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A.

Cancer. 2002; 26: 282-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we and others have shown that cancer cell-derived heregulin, IL-1α, and/or overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor is involved in constitutive NF-κB activation in breast cancer (21Biswas D.K.

The present study was initiated to determine whether NF-κB promotes organ-specific metastasis by selectively up-regulating CXCR4. We demonstrate that NF-κB directly regulates the expression of CXCR4, which appears to be critical for the motility of cancer cells in response to SDF-1α in vitro. In addition, we also show that cells that express CXCR4 are clonally selected during their growth in the mammary fat pad of nude mice. A further increase in CXCR4 expression and SDF-1α-mediated migration was observed in cancer cells that metastasized to the lungs. Breast Cancer Cell Lines—The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were obtained from the ATCC and grown in minimum essential medium + 10% fetal calf serum. LxSN11, IκBαSR6, and IκBαSR10 cells, which are derived from MDA-MB-231 cells, have been described previously (19Patel N.M. Nozaki S. Shortle N.H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Newton T.R. Rice S. Gelfanov V. Boswell S.H. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Nakshatri H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4159-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs and Transient Transfection Assays—The CXCR4 promoter was recloned by PCR using a Genome Walker kit (Clontech). PCR-amplified DNA was cloned into the pBL-CAT3 vector and sequenced. Deletion mutants were also generated by PCR. The p65, p50, and Bcl-3 expression vectors were a generous gift from Dr. W. Greene (Gladstone Institute for Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, CA). The expression vectors for NIK, IKKα, and IKKβ were a generous gift from Dr. D. Donner (Indiana University School of Medicine). The CXCR4 expression vector was a kind gift from Dr. G. Alkhatib (Indiana University School of Medicine). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the CXCR4/CAT reporter and expression vectors along with a β-galactosidase expression vector (RSVβ-gal and pcH110 for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, respectively) by the calcium phosphate method. The β-galactosidase activity and CAT activity in an equal number of β-galactosidase units were measured as described previously (14Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—COS-1 cells were transfected with 10 μg of expression vectors, and whole cell extracts or nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection as described previously (14Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Patel N.M. Nozaki S. Shortle N.H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Newton T.R.

EMSA was performed with CXCR4, NF-κB, and SP-1 probes as described previously (14Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNase Protection Assay—Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The RNase protection assay with hCR6 or hAPO-5 probes (BD Pharmingen) was performed as described previously (19Patel N.M. Nozaki S. Shortle N.H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Newton T.R. Rice S. Gelfanov V. Boswell S.H. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Nakshatri H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4159-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The hCR6 probe set simultaneously measures the expression of CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, BLR-1, BLR-2, and V28. The hAPO-5 probe measures XIAP, TRAF-1, TRAF-2, TRAF-3, TRAF-4, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and TRPM-2. Mouse Mammary Fat Pad Injection and Isolation of Cancer Cells— MDA-MB-231 cells (106) were injected into the mammary fat pad of 7-week-old nude mice. Mammary tumors were resected after 6 weeks, minced, and digested for 1 h at 37 °C in digestion buffer (2 mg/ml collagenase type 3, 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase in 10 ml of PBS/g of tumor). Cell pellets were digested again for 20 min at 37 °C with protease (12.5 mg/ml in PBS). Cell pellets were washed in PBS and plated in growth medium. Metastatic cells from the lungs were similarly isolated with the exception that the lungs were collected 8 weeks after removal of the primary tumor. CXCR4 expression was measured periodically in cultured tumor- and metastasis-derived cancer cells. Data presented in the text were obtained from cells cultured for 1 month. Cell Surface Expression of CXCR4 —Cell surface expression of CXCR4 was measured by flow cytometry. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to either CXCR4 or an isotype control (BD Pharmingen) in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications and then analyzed by flow cytometry (25Christopherson II, K.W. Campbell J.J. Hromas R.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 3562-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The staining protocol used was as follows. Cells were first washed in PBS, penicillin, streptomycin, 1% bovine serum albumin and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, penicillin, streptomycin, 1% bovine serum albumin containing the appropriate antibody. Samples were mixed and incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 40 min. The cells were then washed twice in PBS, penicillin, streptomycin, 1% bovine serum albumin and fixed in PBS, 1% paraformaldehyde. One hundred thousand events were accumulated for each analysis. Samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the data were averaged for statistical analysis. Data are presented as means ± S.E., and comparisons were made using the two-tailed Student's t test. Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis assays were performed using 96-well chemotaxis chambers (NeuroProbe) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions as described previously with minor variations (25Christopherson II, K.W. Campbell J.J. Hromas R.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 3562-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 ng/ml CXCL12/SDF-1α was added to 300 μl of phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the lower chamber. Twenty-five thousand fluorescent-tagged (4 μg/ml calcein AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) cells in 50 μl of medium were added to the upper chamber, separated from the lower chamber by a membrane (5.7-mm diameter, 5-μm pore size, polycarbonate membrane). Total cell migration was obtained by measuring the fluorescence (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 530 nm) on a microplate spectrofluorometer and calculating the cell number in the lower chamber in comparison to a cell number standard curve after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Percentage of migration was calculated by dividing the number of cells in the lower chamber by the total cell input multiplied by 100 and subtracting random migration (always less than 7%) to the lower chamber in the absence of SDF-1α. Three samples were analyzed separately in triplicate, and the data were averaged for statistical analysis. Data are presented as means ± S.E., and comparisons were made using the two-tailed Student's t test. MDA-MB-231 Cells Overexpressing IκBα Super-repressor Display Lower Levels of CXCR4 mRNA—We reported previously the generation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells overexpressing the IκBα super-repressor (19Patel N.M. Nozaki S. Shortle N.H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Newton T.R. Rice S. Gelfanov V. Boswell S.H. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Nakshatri H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4159-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells contain constitutively active NF-κB and express a number of prometastatic (uPA, IL-6, and IL-8) and antiapoptotic genes (cIAP-2 and TRAF-1) in an NF-κB-dependent manner (18Newton T.R. Patel N.M. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Stauss C.R. Goulet Jr., R.J. Nakshatri H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18827-18835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Patel N.M. Nozaki S. Shortle N.H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Newton T.R. Rice S. Gelfanov V. Boswell S.H. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Nakshatri H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4159-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Nakshatri H. Goulet Jr., R.J. Curr. Probl. Cancer. 2002; 26: 282-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive NF-κB DNA binding activity and cIAP-2 expression were lower in IκBα super-repressor-expressing cells (IκBαSR6 and IκBαSR10) compared with cells transduced with retrovirus vector alone (LxSN11) (19Patel N.M. Nozaki S. Shortle N.H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Newton T.R. Rice S. Gelfanov V. Boswell S.H. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Nakshatri H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4159-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To determine whether NF-κB similarly regulates the expression of CXCR4 in these cells, we performed an RNase protection assay with RNA from LxSN11, IκBαSR6, and IκBαSR10 cells. CXCR4 transcripts could be detected in LxSN11 cells but not in IκBαSR6 and IκBαSR10 cells (Fig. 1A). To further confirm the involvement of NF-κB in CXCR4 expression, an RNase protection assay was performed with RNA from untreated and parthenolide-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Parthenolide is a relatively specific inhibitor of NF-κB and has been used by a number of investigators for in vitro studies (26Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5617-5623PubMed Google Scholar). Parthenolide reduced the expression of CXCR4 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether IL-1α, a potent inducer of NF-κB, alters CXCR4 expression, we performed an RNase protection assay with RNA from MCF-7 breast cancer cells containing the empty vector (pcDNA3) or cells that stably overproduce IL-1α. These cell lines have been described elsewhere. 2S. Kumar, K. D. Miller, H. L. Chua, H. Kishimoto, R. M. Bigsby, and H. Nakshatri, submitted. Consistent with the role of NF-κB in CXCR4 expression, IL-1α-overproducing cells displayed elevated CXCR4 compared with cells with the pcDNA3 vector (Fig. 1C). To ensure that there is a correlation between CXCR4 mRNA and cell surface expression of the CXCR4 protein, we performed flow cytometric analysis with an antibody that specifically recognizes CXCR4 on the cell surface. Cell surface expression of CXCR4 was observed in MCF-7 cells that overexpress IL-1α but not in MCF-7-pcDNA3 cells (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results indicate that CXCR4 expression in breast cancer cells is regulated by NF-κB as well as by the cytokines that induce NF-κB. NF-κB Directly Regulates the CXCR4 Promoter—To determine whether NF-κB directly regulates CXCR4 promoter activity, we performed a transient transfection assay in MCF-7 breast cancer cells with a CXCR4/CAT reporter. Two reporters, one with the –897 to +7 region (CXCR4(–897)/CAT) and the other with the –209 to +7 region (CXCR4(–209)/CAT) of the CXCR4 promoter, were used. Reporter activity was measured in the absence or presence of the NF-κB inducers tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1α, or TPA. IL-1α and TPA induced CXCR4/CAT reporter activity (Fig. 3A). Constitutive CXCR4 promoter activity in MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced by IκBαSR (Fig. 3B). Induction of CXCR4(–209)/CAT by IL-1α and TPA suggests that induction of CXCR4 by IL-1α and TPA is an indirect effect of NF-κB activation or that the NF-κB binding site in the CXCR4 promoter is distinct from the putative site predicted from the TFSEARCH computer program. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we generated additional deletion mutants (CXCR4(–121)/CAT and CXCR4(–66)/CAT) and tested them for activity in the presence of various subunits of NF-κB. The p65 but not the p50 subunit of NF-κB increased the activity of both reporters (Fig. 3C). Among the upstream kinases involved in NF-κB activation, NIK activated the CXCR4 promoter. IKKα but not IKKβ activated CXCR4(–897)/CAT. Although the basal activity of CXCR4(–66)/CAT was 5 times lower than that of CXCR4(–121)/CAT, the p65 subunit still activated this reporter. These results suggest that the NF-κB response element is located within the –66 to +7 sequence of the CXCR4 promoter. We next determined direct binding of the NF-κB subunits to the –66 to +7 region of the CXCR4 promoter by EMSAs using extracts from COS-1 cells transfected with various subunits of NF-κB and the –66 to +7 region of CXCR4 as a probe. The p50 subunit, either alone or in combination with the p65 subunit, bound to the probe (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4). Similar results were obtained when nuclear extracts instead of whole cell extracts were used (Fig. 4, lanes 5–7). Neither c-Rel nor Bcl-3 bound to this region (data not shown). Unlabeled oligonucleotide with a classical NF-κB binding site from the immunoglobulin promoter but not the SP-1 binding site reduced the CXCR4 probe·protein complex formation (Fig. 4, lanes 8–10). The CXCR4 DNA probe·protein complex could be disrupted by an antibody against p65 and supershifted partially by an antibody against p50 (lanes 11–14). A nonspecific antibody (against the p110 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) had no effect on the CXCR4 probe·protein complex (lane 14). These results indicate that the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB directly bind to the CXCR4 promoter. Because this region of the promoter lacks a classical NF-κB response element, it appears that the p50 and p65 subunits bind to a non-classical response element. The exact p50 and p65 binding site sequence is yet to be determined because results of a DNase I footprinting assay were inconclusive (data not shown). Also we did not detect the binding of NF-κB subunits using EMSA when the probe contained only the –66 to –33 or the –32 to +1 regions of the CXCR4 promoter (data not shown). Thus, it appears that NF-κB DNA binding requires the entire –66 to +1 region. NF-κB Regulates SDF-1α-mediated Migration of MDA-MB-231 Cells through CXCR4 —To determine the consequence of NF-κB inhibition on SDF-1α-mediated migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, we performed a chemotaxis assay with LXSN11, IκBαSR6, and IκBαSR10 cells with increasing concentrations of SDF-1α. SDF-1α-induced motility was observed with LxSN11 cells but not with IκBαSR6 and IκBαSR10 cells (Fig. 5A). We confirmed the requirement of NF-κB for the SDF-1α-induced migration of MDA-MB-231 cells by performing a chemotaxis assay with cells pretreated with parthenolide. Parthenolide at 5 μm completely inhibits constitutive NF-κB DNA binding activity in these cells (19Patel N.M. Nozaki S. Shortle N.H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Newton T.R. Rice S. Gelfanov V. Boswell S.H. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Nakshatri H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4159-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Inhibition of SDF-1α-dependent migration was observed with cells pretreated with parthenolide (Fig. 5B). Recent studies indicated that NF-κB regulates migration of MDA-MB-231 cells through up-regulation of uPA (27Sliva D. Rizzo M.T. English D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3150-3157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In that case, the failure of IκBαSR cells and parthenolide-pretreated cells to migrate in response to SDF-1α could be due to reduced uPA instead of CXCR4 expression. To directly prove that reduced SDF-1α-dependent migration of IκBαSR cells is due to lower levels of CXCR4 in these cells, we reintroduced CXCR4 by transient transfection and performed a chemotaxis assay. SDF-1α-dependent migration was restored in IκBαSR6 and IκBα10 cells upon reintroduction of CXCR4 cDNA (Fig. 5C). These results confirm that NF-κB is directly involved in SDF-1α-mediated migration of breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 Cells Selected after Growth in Nude Mice Express Higher Levels of Cell Surface CXCR4 —Although a major function of SDF-1α is to transiently up-regulate the expression of integrins involved in the binding of CXCR4-expressing cells to the endothelium and egression from the circulation, SDF-1α is also known to activate other growth-promoting signaling pathways (28Ganju R.K.

If that is the case, unlike in cell culture models, cancer cells that express CXCR4 should grow well in a xenograft model as these cells can take advantage of circulating SDF-1α. Because flow cytometry with an antibody against CXCR4 revealed that less than 10% of MDA-MB-231 cells grown in culture express CXCR4 on their surface, our hypothesis was that only those cells that express higher levels of CXCR4 should grow in nude mice. Furthermore cells expressing CXCR4 should metastasize to organs that express SDF-1α, such as the lungs. To test this possibility, we implanted MDA-MB-231 cells into the mammary fat pad of nude mice, resected the tumors after 6 weeks, a"

https://openalex.org/W2004102471,"Insulin stimulates glucose transport by promoting exocytosis of the glucose transporter Glut4 (refs 1, 2). The dynamic processes involved in the trafficking of Glut4-containing vesicles, and in their targeting, docking and fusion at the plasma membrane, as well as the signalling processes that govern these events, are not well understood. We recently described tyrosine-phosphorylation events restricted to subdomains of the plasma membrane that result in activation of the G protein TC10 (refs 3, 4). Here we show that TC10 interacts with one of the components of the exocyst complex, Exo70. Exo70 translocates to the plasma membrane in response to insulin through the activation of TC10, where it assembles a multiprotein complex that includes Sec6 and Sec8. Overexpression of an Exo70 mutant blocked insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, but not the trafficking of Glut4 to the plasma membrane. However, this mutant did block the extracellular exposure of the Glut4 protein. So, the exocyst might have a crucial role in the targeting of the Glut4 vesicle to the plasma membrane, perhaps directing the vesicle to the precise site of fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2133408651,"To investigate genes involved in pulmonary carcinogenesis and those related to sensitivity of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) to therapeutic drugs, we performed cDNA microarray analysis of 37 NSCLCs after laser-capture microdissection of cancer cells from primary tumors. A clustering algorithm applied to the expression data easily distinguished two major histological types of non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequent analysis of the 18 adenocarcinomas identified 40 genes whose expression levels could separate cases with lymph-node metastasis from those without metastasis. In addition, we compared the expression data with measurements of the sensitivity of surgically dissected NSCLC specimens to six anti-cancer drugs (docetaxel, paclitaxel, irinotecan, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine), as measured by the CD-DST (collagen gel droplet embedded culture-drug sensitivity test) method. We found significant associations between expression levels of dozens of genes and chemosensitivity of NSCLCs. Our results provide valuable information for eventually identifying predictive markers and novel therapeutic target molecules for this type of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2108326699,"Emerging data suggest that signaling by heparin-binding growth factors is influenced by the sulfation state of N-acetylglucosamine residues of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Here we report that the recently identified protein HSulf-1, a heparin-degrading endosulfatase, encodes a cell surface-associated enzyme that diminishes sulfation of cell surface HSPGs. The message encoding this enzyme is readily detectable in a variety of normal tissues, including normal ovarian surface epithelial cells, but is undetectable in 5 of 7 ovarian carcinoma cell lines and markedly diminished or undetectable in ∼75% of ovarian cancers. Similar down-regulation is also observed in breast, pancreatic, renal cells, and hepatocellular carcinoma lines. Re-expression of HSulf-1 in ovarian cancer cell lines resulted in diminished HSPG sulfation, diminished phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases that require sulfated HSPGs as co-receptors for their cognate ligands, and diminished downstream signaling through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway after treatment with fibroblast growth factor-2 or heparin-binding epidermal growth factor. Consistent with these changes, HSulf-1 re-expression resulted in reduced proliferation as well as sensitivity to induction of apoptosis by the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine and the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Collectively, these observations provide evidence that HSulf-1 modulates signaling by heparin-binding growth factors, and HSulf-1 down-regulation represents a novel mechanism by which cancer cells can enhance growth factor signaling.

Hemostasis. 2002; 28: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These biological effects result, in part, from the binding of polypeptides to the highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains of HSPGs. In some cases, this binding requires sulfation of specific sites on the glycosaminoglycan chains. Previous work, for example, has suggested that specific sulfate groups play critical roles in the interactions between heparin, FGF, and the FGF receptor (3Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Caccia P.

In particular, the N- and 2-O-sulfate groups of heparin are essential for its binding to FGF-2, whereas the 6-O-sulfate groups are required for stimulation of FGFR-1 (5Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U.

The sulfation state of HSPGs is classically thought to reflect the activity of sulfotransferases that are active during HSPG biosynthesis. Dhoot et al. (7Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), however, previously identified the quail sulfatase QSulf-1 as a developmentally regulated protein that modulates Wnt signaling by altering HSPG sulfation. Unlike many other sulfatases, which are lysosomal enzymes, QSulf-1 was localized on the cell surface (7Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that signaling by other HB-GFs might be modulated by cell surface sulfatase expression. Morimoto-Tomita et al. (8Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) recently utilized the EST KIAA1077 to identify HSulf-1 as a human homolog of QSulf-1. Upon expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells, HSulf-1 reportedly is released into the medium, where it catalyzes endo-glucosamine-6-sulfatase activity (8Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Further analysis by PCR demonstrated that HSulf-1 mRNA was expressed in a variety of tissues, including ovary, although the size of the transcripts and the possibility of alternative splice forms was not investigated (8Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we performed suppression subtraction hybridization analyses of two early and late stage tumors subtracted against normal ovarian epithelial brushings, and we demonstrated that the mRNA corresponding to KIAA1077 is down-regulated (9Shridhar V. Sen A. Chien J. Staub J. Avula R. Kovats S. Lee J. Lillie J. Smith D.I. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 262-270PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the report of Dhoot et al. (7Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) identifying Qsulf-1 as a modulator of Wnt signaling, this observation raised the possibility that KIAA1077 down-regulation might alter growth factor signaling in ovarian cancer. Current understanding suggests that generation of the neo-plastic phenotype requires multiple genetic or epigenetic changes that increase proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and enhance cell invasiveness (10Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). Of interest in the present context is the observation that enhanced signaling by certain “growth factors” can simultaneously stimulate proliferation and inhibit apoptosis (11Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. Science. 1990; 248: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 12Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E.

Elevated expression of and signaling by growth factors that activate the mitogen-activated kinase pathway, including FGF and HB-EGF, have been seen frequently in ovarian cancers and other solid tumors (14Liu J.F.

Cancer. 2002; 97: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of the ERK pathway has been implicated in enhanced proliferation as well as resistance to apoptosis (21Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6594-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 22Dent P. Grant S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 775-783PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, there is considerable interest in understanding the factors that contribute to activation of this pathway as well as mechanisms that can reverse this activation. In this report, we describe the widespread down-regulation of HSulf-1 in cancer cell lines and ovarian cancer specimens. To examine the functional consequences of this down-regulation, we re-expressed HSulf-1 in two ovarian cancer cell lines that lack this message. Results of this analysis suggest that HSulf-1 is a cell surface sulfatase that diminishes HSPG sulfation, thereby modulating signaling by HB-GFs. Consistent with this conclusion, we demonstrate diminished ERK pathway activation after treatment with FGF-2 and HB-EGF, diminished proliferation, and enhanced drug-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines in which HSulf-1 is re-expressed. These observations not only provide new insight into the function of HSufl-1, but also suggest that its down-regulation is a previously unidentified mechanism by which cancer cells enhance growth factor signaling. Cell Culture—OV167, OV177, OV202, OV207, and OV266 ovarian cancer cell lines and the short term cultures of the normal ovarian epithelium were established at the Mayo Clinic (23Conover C.A. Hartmann L.C. Bradley S. Stalboerger P. Klee G.G. Kalli K.R. Jenkins R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-5 and SKOV-3, as well as breast (BT474, MCF-7, MCF-10A, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-435, UACC812, and UACC893), pancreas (AsPc1, BxPc3, CAPAN 1, CAPAN 2, CFPAC-1, and Mia), kidney (HTB45, HTB49, and CRL 1633), and hepatocellular carcinomas (Hep3B, HepG2, HUH7, HSNU182, SNU387, SNU423, SNU449, SNU475, SKHep1 and PLC5) were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Normal human mammary epithelial Cells (HMEC) were from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego). All cells were grown according to the providers' recommendations. Drugs and Reagents—Staurosporine (Sigma) and UCN-01 (Drug Synthesis Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health) were dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 1 mm, stored at –20 °C, and subsequently diluted with serum-free medium before use. In all experiments the concentration of Me2SO did not exceed 0.1%. Cisplatin (Sigma) was prepared immediately before use as a 1000-fold concentrated solution in Me2SO. Fibroblast growth factor, heparin-stabilized FGF, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factors (Sigma) were dissolved in water. Cloning of HSulf-1 cDNA and Gene—BLAST search of the isolated sequence from SSH libraries of early and late stage tumors identified ESTs homologous to KIAA1077 in the dbEST. The homologous ESTs were assembled into a contig with the use of Sequencher 3 software (Gene Codes Corp, Ann Arbor, MI). Additional 5′ sequences not present in KIAA1077 were obtained with electronic walking by assembling overlapping EST sequences in the genome BLAST server. The integrity of the full-length cDNA obtained by this electronic walking was confirmed by PCR analysis using PCR primers flanking each junction between EST clones. For expression of truncation mutants of HSulf-1, the N-terminal portion of HSulf-1 (N-Sulf) containing only the sulfatase domain was amplified using primers NF (5′-ATTGGACCAAATACAATGAAG-3′) and NRFlg (ttaagccttgtcatcgtccttgtagtcGAATGTATCACGCCAAAT), where the lowercase letters encode the FLAG epitope. The C-terminal portion of HSulf-1 (C-Sulf) was amplified using primers CF (5′-CGTGATACATTCCTAGTGG) and CRFlg (ttaagccttgtcatcgtccttgtagtcACCTTCCCATCCATCCCA) with a stop codon introduced after the epitope tag. The full-length HSulf-1 was amplified using primers NF and CRFlg using Expand™ Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science). All three products were cloned into GFP Fusion TOPO® TA Expression plasmid (Invitrogen). For generating a full-length HSulf-1/GFP fusion construct, the stop codon of CRFlg was not included. cDNAs generated from short term cultures of normal ovarian surface epithelial cells were used as a template for generating PCR products for cloning. The products of each PCR were resolved on a 1.6% agarose gel and purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for cloning into expression vectors. Establishment of Stable Transfectants—Exponentially growing SKOV3 cells in 100-mm dishes were washed with serum-free medium and treated with a mixture containing 4 μg of plasmid, 30 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 20 μl of Plus reagent. After 3 h of incubation, complete medium with serum was added. G418 (400 μg/ml) was added 24 h later to select transfectants. Individual colonies were subsequently cloned using cloning cylinders. For controls, cells were similarly transfected with vector (pcDNA3.1 GFP-CT); and stable clones were selected. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from 7 ovarian cancer cell lines and 30 primary ovarian tumors using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed as described (9Shridhar V. Sen A. Chien J. Staub J. Avula R. Kovats S. Lee J. Lillie J. Smith D.I. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 262-270PubMed Google Scholar). 50–100 ng of reverse-transcribed cDNA was used in a multiplex reaction with three different primer pairs Sulf-1F (5′-CCACCTTCATCAATGCCTT-3′) and Sulf-1R (5′-CCTTGACCAGTCCAAACCTGC-3′), Sulf-2F (5′-CATCATTTACACCGCCGACC) and Sulf-2R (5′-CTGCCGTCTCTTCTCCTTC-3′), Sulf-3F (5′-GAGCCATCTTCACCCATTCAA-3′) and Sulf-3R (5′-TTCCCAACCTTATGCCTTGGGT-3′), and GAPDH-F (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′) and GAPDH-R (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTTGTA-3′) in separate reactions to yield 760-, 1260-, and 825-bp products, respectively. The PCR mixes contained 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 μm concentration of each primer for HSulf-1 and 50 μm for the GAPDH primers, and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) in a 12.5-μl reaction volume. The conditions for amplification are as follows: 94 °C for 3 min followed by 29 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9600 Gene-Amp PCR system. The products of the reaction were resolved on a 1.6% agarose gel and photographed using the Gel Doc 1000 photo documentation system. LOH Analysis—The 5 pairs of microsatellite markers within the HSulf-1 gene used in this study are listed in Table I along with their locations within the HSulf-1 gene. Amplifications were performed as described (9Shridhar V. Sen A. Chien J. Staub J. Avula R. Kovats S. Lee J. Lillie J. Smith D.I. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 262-270PubMed Google Scholar) except that annealing was performed at 52–57 °C, and reactions were run in a 96-well plate. After denaturation, PCR products were run on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 8 m urea. Gels were dried, subjected to autoradiography using multiple exposure times, and scored for LOH. Allelic imbalance indicative of LOH was scored, and a >50% loss of intensity of one allele in the tumor sample with respect to the matched allele from normal tissue was observed.Table IPrimers used in LOH analysisSequencesLocation within the geneProduct size% LOH (no. samples with LOH/ no. informative samples)bpCA1F-5′ CATCTCCATGTCTGAACTTC 3′5′ UTR37946% (4/9)CA1R-5′ ACCTCTTCCTTCAACCTCTG 3′13 CA repeatsCA2F-5′ GTCCCTTGTAATGATAATAAG 3′Intron 127547% (7/15)CA2R-5′ GAAGACCAAAGTGGCATC 3′21 CA repeatsCA3F-5′ GAGTAAGAAGAGATATTGGAG 3′Intron 224753% (9/17)CA3R-5′ CCTAGCTGTGTGGATCATTGC 3′11 CA repeatsCA4F-5′ CGAACTCCTGACCTCAAGTG 3′Intron 3-121250% (4/7)CA4R-5′ CAGAGGGTGGGTGCAGAGTC 3′24 CA repeatsCA5F-5′ TAGAATACCTGCACTTCACTG 3′Intron 3-219350% (10/20)CA5R-5′ GAAGACCAAAGTGGCATC 3′10 GAAG repeats Open table in a new tab Northern Blot—Total RNA (15 μg) was fractionated on 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gels and blotted in 1× SPC buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm CDTA (pH 6.8)) onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The probes were labeled using the random primer labeling system (Invitrogen) and purified using spin columns (100 TE) from Clontech. Filters were hybridized at 68 °C with radioactive probes in a hybridization incubator and washed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Analysis of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was quantitated by assessing the number of cells containing nuclear changes indicative of apoptosis (chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation) after staining with DAPI. HSulf-1-transfected SKOV3 cells were seeded in 35-mm plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the plates were washed and changed to serum-free medium. Staurosporine was added to a final concentration of 1 μm for 5 h. DAPI was then added to each well at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. After a 20-min incubation in the dark at 20 °C, cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE200; Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) using excitation and emission filters of 380 and 430 nm. An individual blinded to the experimental conditions counted at least 300 cells in six different high power fields for each treatment. Each treatment was repeated at least three times, performed in triplicate each time. To inhibit apoptosis, the cells were pretreated with 40 μm N-(Nα-benzyl-oxycarbonylvalinylalanyl) aspartic acid (O-methyl ester) fluoromethyl ketone for 1 h before the addition of staurosporine. The significance of differences between experimental variables was determined using the Student's t test. Proliferation Assays—SKOV3 parental cells and cells stably transfected with empty vector were plated at 100,000 cells/10-cm disk in triplicate in complete medium. After trypsinization, the total number of trypan blue-excluding cells was determined daily for 5 days. Treatment with FGF-2, HB-EGF, and EGF—To assess the role of HSulf-1 in HB-GF-mediated signaling, vector-transfected and HSulf-1 clones 7 and 8 were serum-starved for 8–12 h, treated with diluent, 10 ng/ml FGF-2, 100 ng/ml HB-EGF (Sigma), or 10 ng/ml EGF for the times indicated in individual figures. Following treatment, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, scraped from the dishes, and lysed at 4 °C in SDS sample buffer without bromphenol blue. Protein concentrations were determined with bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). Immunoblotting—Equal amounts of protein (20 μg/lane) were separated by electrophoresis on an SDS gel containing a 4–12% acrylamide gradient and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were washed once with TBS, 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked with TBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at 20 °C. The blocking solution was replaced with a fresh solution containing a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling Inc., Beverly, MA). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the blots were washed three times for 10 min each in TBS, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 5% milk/TBST at 20 °C for 1 h. After washing 3 times in TBST, the proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were stripped and reprobed with antisera that recognize total ERK, EGFR phosphorylated on Tyr1068 and/or Tyr992, total EGFR (all from Cell Signaling Inc., Beverly, MA), or mouse monoclonal anti-actin (Sigma). Sulfatase Assay—Confluent flasks of stable transfectants were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in SIE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 1% ethanol) containing 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After cells were sheared by passage through a 20-gauge needle, protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. 100 μg of total cellular protein was preincubated with 10 μm estrone 3-O-sulfamate (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h to inhibit steroid sulfatases. 4-MUS was then added to a final concentration of 10 mm in the presence of 10 mm lead acetate in a total volume of 200 μl. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml of 0.5 m Na2CO3/NaHCO3 (pH 10.7). The fluorescence of the liberated 4-methylumbelliferone was measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. To assess the effects of transient transfection, SKOV3 cell lysates prepared 48 h after transfection with empty vector, full-length HSulf-1 cDNA, or mutant N-Sulf were assayed as described above except that the incubation was shortened to 3.5 h. HSulf-1 Localization—SKOV3 cells seeded on glass coverslips were allowed to adhere overnight and then transfected with empty vector or cDNA encoding full-length HSulf-1 fused at its C terminus to GFP. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and mounted with Vectorshield® mounting medium containing DAPI. The GFP fusion protein was visualized using a Zeiss LS510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Alternatively, SKOV3 cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged HSulf-1, incubated for 24 h, washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde and 1% sucrose, washed with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin for 20 min, and washed three times in washing buffer (PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100). After incubation for 1 h at 20 °C with anti-EGFR antibody, cells were washed four times with washing buffer, incubated with 1:200 TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and 1:200 FITC-conjugated anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in the dark, washed twice in washing buffer, stained with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI for 5 min, washed twice in PBS, and viewed with an Axiovert 35 epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with a 100-watt mercury lamp or a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. HSulf-1 Distribution—48 h after transfection of cDNA encoding GFP-tagged HSulf-1 into SKOV3 parental cells, cells and medium were collected separately. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, scraped, and lysed at 4 °C in SDS buffer without bromphenol blue. Protein concentrations were determined with bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). Conditioned medium was concentrated in a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Millipore Corp). The cell lysate and 50× concentrated medium were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Immunoblotting was performed as described above using anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Sulfation State of Cell Surface HS-GAGs—Cells growing on coverslips for 24 h were fixed in methanol for 10 min at –20 °C, washed with PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 20 °C with 1:30 dilution of mouse 10E4 antibody, which recognizes an epitope that includes the N-sulfated glucosamine residue (Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA). After washing, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy as described above. As a control, cells were stained with antibody 3G10, which recognizes nonglycosylated glycosaminoglycans. In brief, cells grown on coverslips for 24 h were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 20 min, washed, preincubated in buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 3.3 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 1 h, and followed by incubation with 20 milliunits/ml of heparitinase I (Sigma) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After thorough washing, cells were incubated with a 1:250 dilution of 3G10 monoclonal antibody (Seikagaku America) for 2 h at 37 °C followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and examined as described above. Characterization of the HSulf-1 cDNA and Gene—Differential screening of suppression subtraction cDNA libraries generated from primary ovarian tumors subtracted against normal ovarian epithelial cells previously identified an EST homologous to KIAA1077 (9Shridhar V. Sen A. Chien J. Staub J. Avula R. Kovats S. Lee J. Lillie J. Smith D.I. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 262-270PubMed Google Scholar) as a transcript that is down-regulated in ovarian cancer. In order to study the function of the corresponding polypeptide, the cDNA and gene were cloned as described under “Materials and Methods.” After HSulf-1 was assembled into a contig using Sequencher 3 software, a 5696-bp cDNA containing a single open reading frame encoding an 871-amino acid polypeptide was isolated (GenBank™ accession number AF545571). The predicted amino acid sequence is identical to that recently reported for HSulf-1 (8Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Based on the computer algorithm Signal P version 1.1 at the Centre for Biological Sequence Analysis website (24Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar), a 22-amino acid signal peptide (MKYSCCALVLAVLGTELLGSLC↓ST) is found at the N terminus, with the most likely cleavage site indicated by ↓. The transmembrane prediction program TMPRED (25Stoffel K.H.W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar) predicts two additional membrane-spanning domains at amino acids 69–88 and 754–779. The cDNA contains five potential polyadenylation signals AATAAA at positions 4170, 4679, 4820, 4824, 5052, and 5678. The HSulf-1 gene spans ∼211-kb genomic fragment on chromosome 8q13.3. Our analysis of the cDNA and gene agree with that reported by Morimoto-Tomita et al. (8Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol.

In addition to this sequence, we have identified two other noncoding exons, one 5′ to this exon (314 bases, which we call exon 1) and another 3′ to this sequence (165 bases, which we call exon 2). To determine which of these exons, 1, 1A, or 2, are present in transcribed message, primers in exons 1 and 5 were utilized to amplify a 950-bp 5′-UTR from normal ovarian epithelial cells, HMEC, and normal kidney. All of the cDNAs amplified lacked exon 1A. Instead, two different splice variants were amplified, a less abundant one lacking exon 1A but containing exons 1 and 2, and a more abundant one lacking both exon 1A and exon 2 (data not shown). HSulf-1 Is Widely Expressed in Normal Tissue—Northern blot analysis using full-length HSulf-1 cDNA as a probe (Fig. 1D) revealed a 6.0-kb and a smaller 5.0-kb transcript. Expression was observed in all nonlymphoid tissues but was highest in small intestine, pancreas, and colon. Importantly, the blot shown in Fig. 1D contains message from total ovary. Further analysis (Fig. 2, A and B) demonstrated that HSulf-1 message was readily detected in purified human ovarian surface epithelial cells. Testis appears to express tissue-specific splice variants that have not been characterized further.Fig. 2Expression of HSulf-1 mRNA is decreased in cance"

We have previously shown that adenovirally expressed tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) induces apoptosis in melanoma cells and inhibits growth of human melanoma xenografts. Here, we have studied the role of death receptors in apoptosis of melanoma cells induced by TIMP-3. Our results show, that the exposure of three metastatic melanoma cell lines (A2058, SK-Mel-5, and WM-266-4) to recombinant TIMP-3, N-terminal MMP inhibitory domain of TIMP-3, as well as to adenovirally expressed TIMP-3 results in stabilization of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-RI), FAS, and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor-1 (TRAIL-RI) on melanoma cell surface and sensitizes these cells to apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha, anti-Fas-antibody and TRAIL. Stabilization of death receptors by TIMP-3 results in activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, and subsequent apoptosis is blocked by specific caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) and by pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK). Adenovirus-mediated expression of TIMP-3 in human melanoma xenografts in vivo resulted in increased immunostaining for TNF-RI, FAS, and cleaved caspase-3, and in apoptosis of melanoma cells. Taken together, these results show that TIMP-3 promotes apoptosis in melanoma cells through stabilization of three distinct death receptors and activation of their apoptotic signaling cascade through caspase-8."

There is increasing evidence that apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of I-R injury in a variety of organs such as brain (1Cao G. Pei W. Ge H. Liang Q. Luo Y. Sharp F.R. Lu A.

More importantly, inhibiting apoptosis during I-R injury is associated with improved survival and organ function (6Mouw G. Zechel J.L. Zhou Y. Lust W.D. Selman W.R. Ratcheson R.A. Metab.

Unlike necrosis, apoptosis is a regulated cell death process involving specific pathways and cellular components. Therefore, delineating the precise apoptotic mechanisms involved during I-R injury may help optimize future therapies designed to abrogate I-R injury-induced apoptosis. The heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide (CO) system has been shown to provide significant protection against hyperoxic lung injury (8Otterbein L.E. Mantell L.L. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L688-L694PubMed Google Scholar), transplant rejection (9Sato K. Balla J. Otterbein L. Smith R.N. Brouard S. Lin Y. Csizmadia E. Sevigny J. Robson S.C. Vercellotti G. Choi A.M.

Med. 2003; 9: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). CO, a reaction product of heme oxygenase-1 activity, has been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antiapoptotic effects and thereby confers, at least in part, the cytoprotective effects of heme oxygenase-1. Furthermore the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, specifically p38 MAPK, appears to mediate the biologic effects of CO (12Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Brouard S. Otterbein L.E. Anrather J. Tobiasch E. Bach F.H. Choi A.M. Soares M.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that low levels of exogenous CO can suppress I-R-induced apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells and mouse lungs through p38 MAPK activation and caspase 3 activity inhibition (12Zhang X.

However, if CO is to have potential as a therapeutic agent, more precise identification of CO-modulated targets will be necessary. Given our previous data showing that the antiapoptotic effects of CO in I-R lung injury is likely through caspase modulation as well as p38 MAPK activation (12Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we extended our investigations to characterize the precise antiapoptotic pathways and the specific p38 MAPK isoform modulated by CO. We show that CO inhibits Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) expression and subsequent activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9; poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage; and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. In addition, CO differentially modulates the pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family proteins. Furthermore all these effects of CO depend upon p38 MAPK activation, specifically p38α MAPK and the upstream MAPK kinase MKK3. We correlate our endothelial cell findings to mouse lungs subjected to I-R by using MKK3-deficient (MKK3–/–) and Fas receptor-deficient (Fas–/–) mice. Taken together, our data are the first to demonstrate in cell and mouse models that the antiapoptotic effects of CO are dependent on the down-regulation of Fas/FasL expression, caspase activity, and modulation of Bcl-2 proteins via the MKK3/p38α MAPK pathway. Reagents—The caspase inhibitors Z-Asp(OMe)-Gln-Met-Asp(OMe)fluoromethyl ketone (Z-DQMD-FMK), Z-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-IETD-FMK), Z-Leu-Glu(OMe)-His-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-LEHD-FMK), and p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. The phospho-MKK3/6, phospho-p38, and cleaved PARP antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The β-tubulin, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bax, Bid, phospho-p38α, rat IgG-FITC, Fas, and Fas ligand antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The FasL-blocking antibody (MFL4) was purchased from BD Pharmingen. Cell Culture and CO Exposure—Rat primary pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) were generously provided by Dr. Troy Stevens (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL) and were exposed to anoxiareoxygenation (A-R) in the presence or absence of CO according to our previous methods (12Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Murine Lung Ischemia-Reperfusion Model and CO Exposure—Adult 6–8-week-old C57BL/6J and Fas receptor mutant mice (B6.MRL-tnfrsf6lpr, which will be designated as Fas–/–) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). MKK3-deficient mice (MKK3–/–) have been described previously (14Lu H.T. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Gatti E. Mellman I. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Mice were exposed to 500 ppm CO during lung I-R as described previously (12Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J.

Apoptosis Assays—An annexin V-FITC kit (BD Pharmingen) was used to detect the apoptosis of PAECs, and a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect the apoptosis of lung tissues by using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) as detailed previously (12Zhang X.

Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Surface Fas and FasL Expression— Pulmonary artery endothelial cell surface expression of Fas and FasL was analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and Cellquest software. In brief, cells were detached using trypsin; washed twice in cold PBS; pelleted; suspended in PBS containing Fas (1:100 dilution), FasL (1:100 dilution), or control rat IgG (1:100 dilution) antibody; and incubated on ice for 45 min. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended in PBS containing anti-rat-FITC (1:50 dilution) antibody, and incubated on ice for 45 min. After two washes with PBS, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Protein levels of phospho-p38, phospho-p38α, phospho-MKK3/6, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bid, Bax, cleaved PARP, Fas, and FasL were analyzed by Western blot assays. To verify equivalent sample loading, membranes were stripped with Blot Restore Membrane rejuvenation solution (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) and reprobed with anti-total p38 or anti-β-tubulin antibody. Isolation of Cytosolic Fraction and Release of Cytochrome c—The cytosolic fraction of PAECs was isolated with Cytochrome c Release Apoptosis assay kit (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA). Western blot with mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products) was then performed. To verify equivalent sample loading, membranes were stripped with Blot Restore Membrane rejuvenation solution and reprobed with anti-β-tubulin antibody. Measurement of Caspase 3, 8, and 9 Activity—The activity of caspases 3, 8, and 9 was measured with colorimetric assays using the CaspACE assay system (Promega, Madison, WI), Caspase 8 Colorimetric Activity assay kit (Chemicon International, Inc.), and Caspase 9 assay kit (Calbiochem), respectively. In brief, for PAECs, after treatment with A-R, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in cell lysis buffer. Lung tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (312.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), 31.25% sucrose, 0.3125% CHAPS, 0.1% Triton X-100. Cell and tissue lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were incubated with the colorimetric substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-pNA), N-acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Ac-IETD-pNA), or Ac-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Ac-LEHD-pNA) for caspases 3, 8, and 9, respectively. The release of pNA from Ac-DEVD-pNA, Ac-IETD-pNA, or Ac-LEHD-pNA was measured at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer. Plasmid Constructs and Transient Transfections—The p38α MAPK constructs have been described previously (12Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and the MKK3 and MKK6 plasmids were obtained from Dr. Jawed Alam. Cells were incubated for 6 h with DNA mixtures containing serum-free medium, Fu-GENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), and wild type or dominant negative mutant plasmids. After incubation, cells were cultured for an additional 16 h in complete medium and then exposed to A-R in the presence or absence of 15 ppm CO. We have demonstrated the transfection efficiency of PAECs to exceed 80% using pEGFP transfections and by examining the cells under phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy as described previously (15Zhang X. Bedard E.L. Potter R. Zhong R. Alam J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L815-L829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed by Student's t test. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. CO Exerts an Antiapoptotic Effect through the p38α Isoform of p38 MAPK and the Upstream MAPK Kinase MKK3 in PAECs during A-R—We have previously shown that CO activates p38 MAPK and that the inhibition of p38 MAPK using SB203580 ablates the antiapoptotic effect of CO (12Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Despite increased p38 MAPK activity during reperfusion, apoptosis still occurs, and this is likely due to the fact that apoptosis is initiated during anoxia; unless p38 MAPK is activated to sufficient levels during anoxia, there is no attenuation of apoptosis during the reperfusion phase (12Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A we show a time course of when p38 activation occurs in the presence and absence of CO in PAECs. CO increases phospho-p38 levels during anoxia after 8 h, but p38 activation is maximal at 24 h. Of note, in the absence of CO, pulmonary artery endothelial cell death is maximal after 24 h of anoxia and is maintained during 30 min to 8 h of reoxygenation (15Zhang X. Bedard E.L. Potter R. Zhong R. Alam J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L815-L829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, in subsequent assays we use 24 h of anoxia and 24 h of anoxia followed by 1 h of reoxygenation as the time points of interest in PAECs. There are four known isoforms of p38 MAPK (α, β, γ, and δ). SB203580 specifically inhibits p38α and p38β but has no effects on p38γ and p38δ (16Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar). Therefore, in Fig. 1B we investigated whether CO activated p38α and/or p38β during A-R. CO activated p38 MAPK, the p38α isoform, and the MAPK kinase(s) upstream of p38 MAPK, MKK3/6, but not p38β (data not shown) during A-R. There are no specific antibodies to MKK3 and MKK6 individually to the best of our knowledge. To delineate the specific roles of p38α, MKK3, and MKK6 in mediating the antiapoptotic effect of CO during A-R, we performed transient transfection experiments with dominant negative mutant (DNM) plasmids of p38α, MKK3, and MKK6. CO was unable to inhibit A-R-induced apoptosis in PAECs transfected with p38α or MKK3 DNM plasmids (Fig. 1, C and D). However, CO still attenuated A-R-induced apoptosis in PAECs transfected with wild type p38α (12Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), wild type MKK3, wild type MKK6, or MKK6 DNM (data not shown). Of note, the background level of cell death due to transfection of p38 DNM or MKK3 DNM in room air was similar to that in room air alone. These data indicate that CO exerts its antiapoptotic effect by modulating the MKK3/p38α MAPK pathway, and the ability of SB203580 to attenuate the antiapoptotic effect of CO is likely due to the inhibition of p38α (since p38β is not involved in our model). Inhibition of Fas/FasL or Modulation of the MKK3/p38 MAPK Pathway by CO Attenuates I-R-induced Apoptosis in Vitro (PAECs) and in Vivo (Mouse Lung) during I-R—The binding of FasL to the Fas receptor is a prototypic signal for apoptosis, and therefore we investigated whether FasL inhibition can attenuate A-R-induced apoptosis in PAECs. Pretreatment of PAECs with a blocking antibody to FasL decreased apoptosis to levels similar to those of cells treated with exogenous CO (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, 1 h of pretreatment with 10 μm SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, attenuated the antiapoptotic effect of CO. Pretreatment with SB203580 or anti-FasL in room air showed basal levels of cell death similar to those in room air alone. Lung I-R injury is an in vivo correlate of A-R injury in pulmonary cells. Similar to our in vitro data, our in vivo data confirm that CO has an antiapoptotic effect during I-R that is mediated by MKK3/p38 MAPK. In Fig. 2C, panel b, we show that wild type mice subjected to lung I-R exhibited increased TUNEL staining throughout the lung compared with that in naïve mice (panel a). Exogenous CO significantly attenuated I-R-induced TUNEL staining (panel d). In the presence of a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or in the genetic absence of MKK3, CO had little effect (panels e and f, respectively). Of note, similar to our cell data, CO retained its antiapoptotic effect in MKK6-deficient mice (data not shown). Furthermore we confirm our in vitro data by showing that Fas–/–mice do not exhibit I-R-induced lung apoptosis, suggesting that the Fas pathway may potentially be a mechanism of I-R-induced apoptosis (panel c). CO Decreases Fas and FasL Expression through the MKK3/p38 MAPK Pathway in Vitro and in Vivo during I-R—In PAECs and mouse lung, we illustrated that the antiapoptotic effect of CO is dependent upon MKK3/p38 MAPK and that Fas/FasL inhibition also has a profound antiapoptotic effect. Therefore, we hypothesized that CO exerts an antiapoptotic effect during I-R by modulating the Fas/FasL pathway through MKK3/p38 MAPK. Anoxia alone or A-R increased Fas expression, which was significantly decreased in the presence of CO (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–5). Furthermore CO-mediated attenuation of Fas expression was ablated in the presence of a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (lanes 7 and 8). Similar results were obtained for FasL expression in PAECs (Fig. 3B). Cells treated with SB203580 in room air (lane 6) showed basal levels of Fas and FasL expression similar to those in room air alone. In Fig. 3C, lane 3, we confirmed our data in vivo by showing that CO decreased I-R-induced Fas/FasL expression in lung tissue. However, CO could not decrease Fas/FasL expression in wild type mice treated with a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or MKK3–/– mice subjected to lung I-R (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 7, respectively). Naïve MKK3–/– mice exhibited basal levels of Fas and FasL expression (Fig. 3C, lane 5). These data indicate that CO can inhibit the expression of Fas/FasL and that this effect depends upon MKK3/p38 MAPK in both cells and mouse lung during I-R injury. CO Inhibits the Activity of Caspases 3, 8, and 9 through the MKK3/p38 MAPK Pathway in Vitro and in Vivo during I-R— We have previously shown that CO inhibits caspase 3 activity via p38 MAPK and that this contributes to the antiapoptotic effect of CO in PAECs during A-R (12Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Our current studies investigate the roles of other caspases and potential downstream targets in the antiapoptotic effects of CO. Caspase 3 activation is regulated by at least two pathways, the ”mitochondrial pathway,“ which involves the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol and subsequent caspase 9 and caspase 3 activation, and/or receptor-mediated pathways, such as Fas/FasL binding, which lead to caspase 8 and then caspase 3 activation (17Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Activated caspase 3 then cleaves substrates, such as PARP, leading to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. Therefore, in the next series of studies we determined whether CO modulates caspases 3, 8, and 9, PARP, and cytochrome c release. In Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5, we first show that CO can effectively attenuate A-R-induced caspase 3, 8, and 9 activation in PAECs during A-R. In addition, pretreatment with SB203580 ablated the ability of CO to inhibit A-R-induced caspase activation, suggesting that CO depends upon p38 MAPK to modulate caspases during A-R in PAECs (lanes 6 and 7). We have already shown that CO decreases Fas/FasL expression through MKK3/p38 MAPK (Fig. 3), and given that blocking FasL also effectively diminishes A-R-induced caspase activities (Fig. 4A, lanes 8 and 9), we postulated a potential sequence of events, namely, that CO activates MKK3/p38α MAPK, leading to decreased Fas/FasL expression and a subsequent decrease in the activity of caspases 3, 8, and 9. Although it appears that CO retains some ability to decrease caspase 3 activity despite treatment with SB203580 (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7), there was no statistical difference between lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 6 and 7. We certainly recognize that there may be other pathways aside from p38 MAPK that are involved; however, at this juncture it is beyond the scope of our studies. Our in vivo data corroborates that CO attenuates caspase 3, 8, and 9 activity through MKK3/p38 MAPK during lung I-R. CO was unable to decrease caspase activity in mouse lungs that were pretreated with SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, or that were MKK3-deficient (Fig. 4B). Caspase 8 Activation Is Upstream of Caspases 9 and 3 during Anoxia—We next attempted to delineate a general order of the caspases using caspase-specific inhibitors. The specificity of the caspase inhibitors have been previously validated (18Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). When PAECs were pretreated with Z-DQMD-FMK, a caspase 3-specific inhibitor, during anoxia, only caspase 3 activity was attenuated, indicating that caspase 3 was downstream of caspases 8 and 9 (Fig. 4C, lane 3). When PAECs were pretreated with Z-IETD-FMK, a caspase 8-specific inhibitor, during anoxia, all three caspases were inhibited (Fig. 4C, lane 4). When PAECs were pretreated with Z-LEHD-FMK, a caspase 9-specific inhibitor, caspase 8 activity was not affected, whereas caspases 3 and 9 were inhibited (Fig. 4C, lane 5). The data indicated that the sequence of caspase activation was 8, 9, and then 3 in PAECs during anoxia. Of note, inhibiting any of the caspases (8, 9, or 3) significantly attenuated A-R-induced apoptosis in PAECs (data not shown). CO Inhibits PARP Cleavage through MKK3/p38 MAPK in Vitro and in Vivo during I-R—Caspase 3 activation results in PARP cleavage and subsequent DNA fragmentation and apoptosis (19Decker P. Muller S. Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2002; 3: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5A we show that CO inhibits PARP cleavage via MKK3/p38 MAPK in PAECs and mouse lung. We confirmed that PARP cleavage is downstream of caspases 8, 9, and 3 by showing that pretreatment with either caspase 3-, 8-, or 9-specific inhibitors all diminished PARP cleavage in PAECs during anoxia (Fig. 5B). CO Inhibits Bid Cleavage through the MKK3/p38 MAPK Pathway in Vitro and in Vivo during I-R—Caspase 8 cleaves Bid, a Bcl-2 homology 3 domain-containing proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, into its active, truncated form with subsequent translocation to the mitochondria where it induces the release of cytochrome c in a manner that is 500-fold more potent than Bax, another proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein (20Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar, 21Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that caspase 8 activity was significantly increased during I-R and that CO attenuated caspase 8 activity via MKK3/p38 MAPK in Fig. 4. We then illustrated that A-R can induce the cleavage of the precursor form of Bid (Fig. 6A, upper bands) to the active, truncated form tBid (lower bands) and that CO can inhibit Bid cleavage via p38 MAPK in PAECs (Fig. 6A, top panel, lanes 4–7). Our in vivo data in Fig. 6A, bottom panel, correlate with our in vitro data. We next confirmed that caspase 8, rather than caspase 3 or 9, is responsible for Bid cleavage during anoxia in PAECs (Fig. 6B). Inhibition of caspase 8 activity with Z-IETD-FMK inhibited anoxia-induced Bid cleavage (Fig. 6B, lane 4), whereas inhibiting caspase 3 or 9 had no effect (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). CO Inhibits A-R-induced Cytochrome c Release, and This Precedes Caspase 9 and 3 Inhibition—Cleaved Bid can translocate to the mitochondria and induce cytochrome c release, which then leads to caspase 9 and 3 activation (21Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar). We found that CO can attenuate A-R-induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 7A, lanes 4 and 5) and that this is through p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 7B, lane 7). FasL inhibition also attenuates cytochrome c release (Fig. 7A, lanes 6 and 7). When we pretreated PAECs with Z-IETD-FMK, a caspase 8-specific inhibitor, cytosolic cytochrome c levels were decreased during anoxia (Fig. 7B, lane 4), whereas caspase 3 and 9 inhibition had no effect (Fig. 7B, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). These data in conjunction with our data showing that CO modulates caspase 8 via MKK3/p38 MAPK (Fig. 4) indicate that CO inhibits cytochrome c through p38 MAPK activation and caspase 8 inhibition, which precedes caspase 9 and 3 inhibition. Of note, CO does not modulate Bax (see below). CO Increases Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 Family Protein Expression through the MKK3/p38 MAPK Pathway in Vitro and in Vivo during I-R—In Fig. 8, top panel, we show that A-R decreases the endogenous levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in PAECs. CO inhibits the A-R-induced decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL expression but depends upon p38 MAPK activity as shown by the effects of SB203580 pretreatment (Fig. 8, top panel, lanes 6 and 7). A-R and CO had no effects on the expression of the proapoptotic Bax. Our in vivo data also strongly support our in vitro results by showing that CO can increase the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL during lung I-R and that the effect of CO is dependent upon the MKK3/p38 pathway (Fig. 8, bottom panel). CO was unable to increase Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL expression in mice that were pretreated with a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (lane 4), or that were deficient in MKK3 (lane 6) during I-R. Of note, inhibiting FasL with anti-FasL antibody had the same effect on cleaved Bid, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL expression as CO had in PAECs during A-R (data not shown). There is significant evidence for the pivotal role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of I-R organ injury (6Mouw G. Zechel J.L. Zhou Y. Lust W.D. Selman W.R. Ratcheson R.A. Metab. Brain Dis. 2002; 17: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Yaoita H. Ogawa K. Maehara K. Maruyama Y.

Transpl. Int. 2000; 13: S568-S572Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Strategies to attenuate I-R-induced apoptosis will expand the currently limited therapeutic options. We have found that CO acts as a potent regulator of apoptosis and may be one mechanism whereby the induction of heme oxygenase-1, the enzyme responsible for more than 90% of endogenous CO generation, affords significant cytoprotection against a variety of noxious stimuli such as lung I-R injury. We previously demonstrated that exogenous administration of 15 ppm CO, an extremely low level significantly below accepted safety standards, dramatically inhibited A-R-induced apoptosis and that the antiapoptotic effect of CO is mediated via p38 MAPK and involves caspase 3 (12Zhang X. Shan P. Otterbein L.E. Alam J. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1248-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Our current studies more precisely delineate potential mechanisms utilized by CO. We show that exogenous CO activates MKK3/6 and p38α MAPK, but not p38β MAPK, during A-R in PAECs. The upstream MAPK kinases MKK3 and MKK6 are thought to be the predominant kinases responsible for activating p38 MAPK. Differences in the relative contribution of these protein kinases in activating p38 MAPK are attributed to the p38 MAPK isoform involved, the stimuli, and cell type. For instance, MKK3 is the major activator of p38 MAPK in PC-12 cells exposed to osmotic stress, while MKK6 is the dominant activator of p38 MAPK in epithelial cells exposed to osmotic stress, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1 and in monocytes stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (23Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E. Kuroyanagi N. Hagiwara M. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore it also has been reported in transformed HeLa and COS-7 cells that MKK3 activates p38α and p38γ, while MKK6 activates p38α, p38β, and p38γ (26Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The different signal transduction pathways initiated by various stimuli leading to the activation of different p38 MAPK isoforms by one or more specific MAPK kinases may account for stimulus-specific and cell-specific responses. We show in our I-R model that in the presence of p38α DNM or MKK3 DNM (in PAECs) or MKK3 deficiency (in mice), CO can no longer attenuate I-R-induced apoptosis. Notably MKK6 DNM transfection in cells or MKK6 deficiency in mice had no effect on the antiapoptotic effect of CO. The literature presents both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic effects of p38 MAPK activation that are likely a reflection of cell type, different inducers, and, potentially, the differential modulation of each of the different p38 MAPK isoforms. Although p38α MAPK is generally thought to be proapoptotic, there are recent reports that p38α MAPK, but not p38β MAPK, can inhibit the apoptotic death of differentiating neurons (27Okamoto S. Krainc D. Sherman K. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7561-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The p38 MAPK isoforms are likely coupled to distinct upstream signal transduction pathways. This would enable activation of specific p38 MAPK isoforms in response to a variety of stimuli. Alternatively the p38 MAPK isoforms may have different downstream targets, which would allow coupling of the various p38 MAPK isoforms to specific biologic responses. Thus, the differential activation of the p38 MAPK isoforms can facilitate cell type- and stimulus-specific cellular responses and may account for the multiple actions of p38 MAPK, thereby highlighting the importance of precisely identifying the p38 MAPK isoforms and upstream modulators involved. Our data indicate that the antiapoptotic effect of CO, in our models of endothelial cell and lung I-R, is dependent upon MKK3/p38α MAPK pathways. The Fas (CD95)/Fas ligand (CD95L) system is a key regulator of apoptosis. Binding of Fas by its ligand FasL can induce caspase 8 activation and lead to the activation of downstream caspases followed by cleavage of key regulatory proteins, such as PARP, and ultimately result in apoptosis (28Wajant H. Science. 2002; 296: 1635-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 29Sartorius U. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). The Fas/FasL system was up-regulated in myocytes during hypoxia, ischemia, and I-R (31Yue T.L. Ma X.L. Wang X. Romanic A.M.

Care Med. 2001; 163: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) found that increased Fas/FasL expression in lung tissues after lipopolysaccharide injury played a critical role in lung injury and that the proper regulation of the Fas/FasL system was important for the potential treatment of acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Ke et al. (34Ke B. Buelow R. Shen X.D. Melinek J. Amersi F. Gao F. Ritter T. Volk H.D. Busuttil R.W. Kupiec-Weglinski J.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 2002; 13: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) showed that heme oxygenase-1 gene transfer prevented Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis and significantly prolonged allogeneic orthotopic liver transplantation survival. We show that I-R lung injury increases Fas/FasL expression in PAECs and lung tissues, which can then be modulated by CO. The administration of a blocking FasL antibody in cells or Fas deficiency in mice decreased apoptosis to levels found in CO-treated cells and animals. Moreover, CO modulates Fas/FasL and subsequent downstream effectors via p38α MAPK and MKK3 in lung I-R. CO could not attenuate Fas and FasL expression and the downstream effectors in the presence of p38 MAPK inhibition or MKK3 deficiency. We also show that CO differentially modulates pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members through the MKK3/p38 MAPK pathway. I-R injury decreases antiapoptotic protein levels (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL), but CO maintains the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL while decreasing levels of the proapoptotic cleaved Bid during I-R. Bid has been implicated in the tumor necrosis factor and Fas death signal pathways (21Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar, 35Singh R. Pervin S. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37630-37636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism through which Bid is proteolytically activated in PAECs and lung during I-R is unclear at the present time. However, in other cells and tissues, several intracellular molecules have been proposed to be the activators of Bid, including caspase 8, granzyme B, and caspase 3 (20Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Med. 2000; 192: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The Fas/caspase 8 pathway has been reported to be the most efficient mechanism for Bid cleavage in various cell types and could be the major pathway for Bid cleavage in our model. We show that Fas/FasL expression and caspase 8 activity are significantly increased during I-R and that the blockade of Fas/FasL during A-R also attenuated Bid cleavage. Furthermore caspases 9 and 3 have no effect on Bid cleavage. CO exposure can inhibit cleavage of Bid during I-R but is dependent upon p38 MAPK/MKK3 activity in cells and mouse lung. There is no change in the proapoptotic protein level of Bax in PAECs during A-R with or without CO exposure. We also demonstrate that CO attenuates the apoptotic events downstream of Bid cleavage, namely cytochrome c release, caspase 9 and 3 activation, and finally PARP cleavage. We confirm that the aforementioned events are mediated by CO through MKK3/p38α MAPK and Fas/FasL modulation. In summary, our observations that FasL inhibition can reproduce the effects of CO on Bcl-2 proteins, cytochrome c release, and PARP in conjunction with our data showing that CO-modulated Fas/FasL expression is downstream of MKK3/p38α MAPK suggest that a likely progression of CO-mediated antiapoptotic signaling is first MKK3/p38α MAPK activation, then Fas/FasL down-regulation followed by decreased caspase 8 activity, then differential modulation of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, and finally decreased cytochrome c release and cleaved PARP expression. Furthermore we are the first to validate these cellular mechanisms of CO in vivo when we demonstrate that Fas-deficient mice do not exhibit I-R-induced apoptosis and that p38 MAPK inhibition or MKK3 deficiency in mice ablates the ability of CO to modulate Fas/FasL and downstream apoptosis effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2070010954,"Studies on the mechanism of activation of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels have often yielded conflicting results. In the current study, we have investigated the influence of expression level on the mode of regulation of TRPC3 channels. At relatively low levels of expression in DT40 chicken B-lymphocytes, TRPC3 was activated by the depletion of Ca2+ stores. Expression was increased by either transfecting with a 10-fold greater concentration of plasmid or transfecting with TRPC3 under control of a more efficient avian β-actin promoter. At higher levels of expression, TRPC3 was no longer store-operated but could be activated through receptor-coupled phospholipase C. Under these expression conditions, TRPC3 was efficiently activated in DT40 cells lacking inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. The Ca2+ store-operated channels formed upon expression of TRPC3 at limited levels were blocked by gadolinium; the receptor-activated channels formed upon expression of higher levels of TRPC3 were insensitive to gadolinium. These findings indicate that a single ion channel protein can form or contribute to the formation of channels regulated in two very distinct ways, i.e. either by phospholipase C-derived messengers or Ca2+ store-depletion. The mechanism of regulation of the channels depends on their level of expression.

Among the members of the canonical TRP (TRPC) subfamily (designated TRPC1 through TRPC7), human TRPC3, first cloned by Zhu et al. (9Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), has been shown in many heterologous expression systems to behave as a receptor-activated channel with constitutive activity that cannot be further increased by Ca2+ store depletion (10Zhu X.

Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hofmann et al. (13Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) showed that TRPC3 and its structural relative TRPC6 can be activated by diacylglycerols (DAGs), providing a possible mechanism of activation of these channels by phospholipase C-linked receptors independent of IP3 and store depletion. We recently demonstrated that TRPC3 is regulated by store depletion when transiently expressed in DT40 chicken B-lymphocytes (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and we proposed TRPC3 as a candidate for store-operated, non-selective cation channels. However, Venkatachalam et al. (15Venkatachalam K. Ma H.-T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) reported that, in this same cell line, TRPC3 behaves as a receptor-activated channel with no dependence on the depletion of Ca2+ stores. In addition, the store-operated behavior of TRPC3, which we have described previously (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), conflicts with the non-store-operated, receptor-regulated behavior reported by us for HEK293 cells (12McKay R.R. Szmeczek-Seay C.L. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We thus suggested that the mode of activation of TRPC3 channels may depend on the level of expression (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the present work, we addressed directly the impact of channel expression levels on the mechanism of regulation of TRPC3 in the avian B cell line, DT40. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—The chicken B lymphocyte cell line DT40 and the mutant variant in which the genes for all three IP3R types were disrupted were obtained from the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN; RIKEN Cell Bank numbers RCB1464 and RCB1467). Cells were cultured essentially as described in Sugawara et al. (16Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Loading of the cells with the Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 and the ratiometric measurement of intracellular Ca2+ were accomplished as described previously (17Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St.J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). DT40 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J.

When indicated, cells were co-transfected with the human M5 muscarinic receptor (50 μg/ml in pcDNA3) and/or rat IP3R-3 in pCB6+ (10 μg/ml; provided by Dr Graeme Bell, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). For some experiments, TRPC3 was subcloned into the lcf201 expression vector (provided by Drs Jean-Marie Buerstedde and Hiroshi Arakawa, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, University of Hamburg, Germany) under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter for expression in DT40 cells. Cells were assayed 17–25 h post-transfection. Fluorescence measurements were performed under the conditions indicated with single enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) positive cells, selected by their yellow/green fluorescence (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 520 nm). The fluorescence intensity of multiple Fura-2-loaded DT40 cells was monitored with a CCD camera-based imaging system (17Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St.J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W.

Under the conditions of measurement, EYFP expression did not contribute significant fluorescence.

Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar) at the C terminus via an AscI restriction site. TRPC3 with fluorescent proteins fused to the C terminus behaves indistinguishably from the native protein in both store-operated and second messenger-operated modes (12McKay R.R. Szmeczek-Seay C.L.

St. J. Bird, and J. W. Putney, Jr., unpublished observations. Confocal Microscopy—Fluorescence images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) using an argon laser and excitation at 488 nm through a 100× (oil immersion) objective lens. Recently, we demonstrated that human TRPC3 is regulated by Ca2+ store depletion when transiently expressed in DT40 chicken B-lymphocytes (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), whereas Venkatachalam et al. (15Venkatachalam K. Ma H.-T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) expressed TRPC3 in DT40 cells and obtained a receptor-activated but not store-operated channel. In addition, in our own laboratory, TRPC3 expressed in HEK293 cells was receptor-activated and not store-operated (12McKay R.R. Szmeczek-Seay C.L. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We speculated (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that the coupling mechanism for TRPC3 channels might depend on the level of expression. To address this hypothesis directly, we increased TRPC3 expression in DT40 cells by increasing 10-fold (100 μg/ml) the amount of plasmid carrying cDNA coding for TRPC3 compared with that used in our previous studies (10 μg/ml; as in Refs. 14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and 19Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), increasing significantly, presumably, the number of cDNA copies per transfected cell. For comparison, we also carried out parallel transfections with plasmid coding for TRPC3 (10 μg/ml). We designate the wild-type DT40 cells produced by these transfections T3low-WT and T3high-WT for cells transfected with 10 and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and T3low-KO and T3high-KO for IP3R-KO cells. Along with TRPC3, the cells were co-transfected with 50 μg/ml human M5 muscarinic receptor (in pcDNA3) and a construct encoding EYFP as a transfection marker (10 μg/ml). Co-transfection efficiency ranged between 60–80% for EYFP positive (EYFP+) cells exhibiting carbachol-induced Ca2+ release. For those cells transfected with both M5 and TRPC3, co-transfection efficiency ranged between 70–80% based on the number of EYFP+ cells exhibiting carbachol-induced Ba2+ entry (a functional marker of TRPC3 activation; see below). It is well established that increasing DNA copy number through the plasmid copy number leads to significant increases in protein levels (20Smolke C.D. Keasling J.D. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2002; 78: 412-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Control transfections run in parallel using either 50 or 100 μg/ml EYFP showed that increasing plasmid concentration did not enhance transfection efficiency (i.e. number of transfected cells) but markedly increased expression of the coded protein (EYFP-dependent cell fluorescence; not shown). Plasmid concentrations up to 200 μg/ml did not affect cell growth and/or viability. To confirm differential expression levels of TRPC3 in T3low and T3high DT40 cells, a construct with TRPC3 fused to the Topaz fluorescent protein (18Tsien R.Y. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar) in pcDNA3 was used (T3T). 3Wedel, B. J., Vazquez, G., McKay, R. R., Bird, G. St. J., and Putney, J. W., Jr. (May 2, 2003) J. Biol. Chem. DOI 10.1074/jbc.M303890200. Wild-type DT40 cells were transiently transfected with either 10 or 100 μg of T3T (designated T3Tlow-WT and T3Thigh-WT, respectively) or the equivalent amount of pcDNA3 carrying cDNA for Topaz protein alone (mock-transfected cells). Transfected cells were analyzed for T3T expression by confocal microscopy. In T3Thigh-WT cells, TRPC3 appeared to be localized in punctate spots in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). With microscope settings optimal for T3Thigh visualization (see legend to Fig. 1 for details), in T3Tlow-WT cells the plasma membrane labeling was barely detectable (Fig. 1B), consistent with the notion that lower TRPC3 expression levels are attained when lower amounts of plasmid are used. Cells transfected with equivalent amounts of pcDNA3-Topaz showed a fluorescence labeling confined exclusively to the cytosol (not shown). To evaluate a TRPC3-dependent cation entry under the different transfection conditions, either Ca2+ or Ba2+ entry was fluorometrically evaluated in single EYFP+ cells. We first assessed the influence of store depletion on cation entry in TRPC3-transfected cells. It is well known that, in DT40 cells, passive depletion of endogenous stores following blockade of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPases with thapsigargin results in activation of the CCE pathway (16Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Broad L.M. Braun F.-J. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Kurosaki T. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18888-18896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Unlike other expression systems (e.g. HEK293 cells), DT40 cells have a CCE poorly permeable to Ba2+ (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Venkatachalam K. Ma H.-T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we exploited this property of DT40 cells and reported that, when 10 mm Ba2+ was used, no store-operated entry was observed in non-transfected cells, whereas TRPC3 cells showed a robust Ba2+ entry (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 19Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, in our more recent studies, we find that some untransfected DT40 cells do show a store-operated entry of 10 mm Ba2+. Thus, although it is still possible to document store-operated Ba2+ entry in quantitative terms (see, for example, Fig. 4A), we have now turned to a technique utilizing Ca2+ and specific channel-inhibiting drugs to document store-operated TRPC3 behavior. 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borane (2APB) is a reliable blocker of store-operated Ca2+ entry in most cells (see Ref. 23Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Mackenzie L. Roderick H.J. Berridge M.J. Peppiatt C.M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar and references therein). 2APB substantially inhibits endogenous CCE in DT40 cells but has a negligible effect on TRPC3 store-dependent activity in these cells (19Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); thus 2APB provides an alternative approach to monitor TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry without the contribution of the endogenous channels. As shown previously for wild-type DT40 cells (16Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Broad L.M. Braun F.-J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18888-18896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), mock-transfected cells respond to thapsigargin with a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ reflecting passive depletion of Ca2+ stores due to a blockade of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps. Once Ca2+ levels returned to baseline, 30 μm 2APB was added, and 2 min later Ca2+ was added to the extracellular medium to evaluate activation of the store-operated pathway. CCE in mock-transfected wild-type cells was almost completely blocked (Fig. 2A), confirming the previously reported action of 2APB on the endogenous channels (19Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, wild-type DT40 cells transiently transfected with a low amount of TRPC3-coding vector (T3low-WT) showed a substantial, 2APB-insensitive Ca2+ entry after thapsigargin-induced store depletion (36 of 45 cells, Fig. 2A), consistent with our earlier report (19Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Basal Ca2+ permeability was not affected by TRPC3 expression, as Ca2+ addition to T3low-WT cells not exposed to thapsigargin but maintained in Ca2+-free medium caused no detectable increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (not shown). 1 μm Gd3+ completely blocks store-operated TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry in response to thapsigargin in DT40 cells (19Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, once the peak of TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry was reached, the addition of 1 μm Gd3+ rapidly reversed this entry. However, applying the above described protocol to T3high-WT cells did not result in the appearance of store-operated Ca2+ entry (0 of 53 cells, Fig. 2B), which is in line with published evidence indicating that exogenously expressed TRPC3 usually results in a channel that is not sensitive to intracellular store depletion (Ref. 8Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Lückhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar and references therein). Basal Ca2+ permeability was not affected by TRPC3 expression at higher levels (not shown), again indicating the absence of constitutive channel activity. We hypothesized previously (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that the expression of TRPC3 in DT40 might be lower than in, for example, HEK293 cells in part because of the relative inefficiency in avian cells of the constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in pcDNA3. In support of this contention, we found that the functional expression of the M5 muscarinic receptor was substantially improved when the gene was driven by an avian β-actin promoter (βAP) than when driven by a CMV promoter2 (in the current study, we circumvent the problem with CMV by increasing the concentration of the M5 plasmid 5-fold compared with the amount necessary for the βAP construct; see Ref. 17Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St.J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, in which the βAP construct was used in the amount of 10 μg/ml). Thus, we subcloned the cDNA coding for TRPC3 into the expression vector lcf201 under control of the avian βAP. As for T3high-WT cells, wild-type DT40 cells transiently expressing βAP-driven TRPC3 (transfected with 10 μg/ml) did not show store-operated Ca2+ entry upon depletion of stores with thapsigargin (0 of 38 cells, Fig. 2B, gray trace). When cells were transfected with a combination of the CMV-driven and βAP-driven plasmids (10 μg/ml each), again no store-operated Ca2+ entry was observed (not shown). However, cells transfected with the βAP construct showed the expected carbachol-induced Ba2+ entry when the βAP-driven TRPC3 was co-transfected with the muscarinic M5 receptor (see below), which is consistent with a higher level of channel expression under control of the chicken promoter. These results clearly show a disappearance of store-operated entry with more highly expressed TRPC3 (TRPC3high) in DT40 cells, whether by increasing plasmid concentration or by use of a more efficient promoter. We next examined the effect of differential expression levels on channel behavior when receptor-dependent activation of the PLC pathway occurs. We showed earlier that, in DT40 cells, the activation of TRPC3low through agonist-induced activation of PLC activates TRPC3 through a store-depletion mechanism. A higher level of expression of TRPC3 in wild-type DT40 cells (T3high-WT) transiently expressing the M5 muscarinic receptor resulted in robust carbachol-induced Ba2+ entry (59 of 76 cells, Fig. 3A, black trace) that was not observed in cells transfected with the M5 receptor only (Fig. 3A, gray trace) or with TRPC3 only (not shown). In contrast to TRPC3low (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), cation permeation of TRPC3high could be seen with as little as 2 mm Ba2+; this may be due to the greater number of channels or possibly the greater relative Ba2+ permeability of the channels at high expression. Additionally, in clear contrast to the observations made for TRPC3low (Ref. 19Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar and Fig. 3B), Gd3+ (5 μm) did not appear to block agonist-induced Ca2+ entry in TRPC3high cells (Fig. 3B); in the presence of Gd3+, 0 of 41 TRPC3low cells responded, whereas 26 of 35 TRPC3high cells responded. This lack of sensitivity to Gd3+ is also observed when TRPC3 is exogenously expressed in other cell lines. We next evaluated the behavior of TRPC3 when expressed in IP3R-KO DT40 cells. With low expression in IP3R-KO cells, PLC stimulation does not lead to activation of the channel, indicating an absolute requirement on IP3 receptor expression for agonist activation of TRPC3low, presumably because IP3 receptors are necessary for agonists to deplete Ca2+ stores (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, carbachol stimulation of IP3R-KO cells transiently co-transfected with the M5 muscarinic receptor, the type-3 rat IP3 receptor, and TRPC3low resulted in a rapid release of calcium from stores followed by activation of TRPC3-mediated Ba2+ entry (10 mm Ba2+, 18 of 29 cells, Fig. 4A). Neither transient Ca2+ release nor Ba2+ entry was detected in IP3R-KO cells co-transfected only with M5 receptor and TRPC3low (0 of 33 cells responded, Fig. 4A). When IP3R-KO cells were transiently co-transfected with the M5 muscarinic receptor and TRPC3high, carbachol addition failed to induce release, but Ba2+ addition to the extracellular medium gave rise to a robust Ba2+ entry (60 of 81 cells, Fig. 4B) that was not observed in cells transfected with M5 receptor only (Fig. 4B). As for wild-type cells, T3high-KO cells lacking the muscarinic receptor did not show carbachol-induced Ba2+ entry (not shown). These results contrast sharply with those for TRPC3low expressing IP3R-KO cells. It is known that members of the TRPC3/6/7 subfamily of TRPC channels can be activated by synthetic DAGs (13Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that TRPC3low expression in either wild-type or IP3R-KO DT40 cells results in a channel sensitive to 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a membrane-permeant DAG (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of OAG on TRPC3-mediated Ba2+ influx in both wild-type and IP3R-KO DT40 cells expressing high levels of TRPC3. In both mock- and TRPC3-transfected cells, OAG treatment did not affect either cytosolic Ca2+ levels or Ca2+ content of the stores (not shown). The addition of OAG to both T3high-WT and T3high-KO cells significantly stimulated Ba2+ influx (WT, 36 of 48 cells; KO, 31 of 41 cells, Fig. 5), whereas there was no effect on cation entry in mock-transfected cells. In both cell types, OAG-induced Ba2+ entry was comparable with that seen with receptor stimulation (Figs. 3 and 4) and was similar in T3high-WT and T3high-KO cells, indicating that, as for receptor-stimulation, OAG action is independent of the IP3R. A similar conclusion was drawn for TRPC3low (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that OAG activation of TRPC3 involves a mechanism that is independent on the expression level of the channel, probably reflecting an intrinsic property of the TRPC3 protein itself. The human isoform of TRPC3, originally cloned by Zhu et al. (9Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), is one of the most extensively characterized members of the TRPC subfamily of cation channels. Although initial studies indicated that the expression of TRPC3 in heterologous cell systems increased CCE (9Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), it was shown later that this reflected a constitutive rather than regulated mode of Ca2+ entry (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In fact, in most subsequent studies in which TRPC3 was exogenously expressed in cell lines, the channel behaved as a receptor-activated non-selective cation channel not dependent on store-depletion (11Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 12McKay R.R. Szmeczek-Seay C.L. Lièvremont J.-P.

Raeymaekers L. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 345-358Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, we recently demonstrated that store depletion does regulate TRPC3 when the channel is transiently expressed in DT40 chicken B-lymphocytes (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). At about the same time, Venkatachalam et al. transiently expressed TRPC3 in both wild-type and IP3R-KO DT40 cells but observed a channel whose activation turned out to be strictly dependent upon receptor stimulation of the PLC pathway but was not regulated by store depletion (15Venkatachalam K. Ma H.-T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These authors proposed that, in DT40 cells, TRPC3 forms receptor-operated cation channels likely activated through PLC-dependent generation of DAG. Similarly, in our own laboratory we found that, in HEK293 cells, TRPC3 is not a store-operated channel (12McKay R.R. Szmeczek-Seay C.L. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) but appears to function as a DAG-regulated channel (25Trebak M. Bird G.St.J. McKay R.R. Birnbaumer L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16244-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We speculated that the store-operated behavior of TRPC3 in DT40 cells might result from a lower level of expression as compared with HEK293 cells (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the current study, we increased TRPC3 expression by two different strategies, i.e. by increasing the concentration of TRPC3-containing plasmid and by expressing TRPC3 under control of a more efficient promoter. The results clearly demonstrate that increasing the level of expression of TRPC3 in DT40 cells indeed results in the disappearance of store-operated behavior and the appearance of an IP3R-independent, receptor-activated behavior. The over-expression strategies were very efficient in causing this transformation of behavior; of 53 cells observed following transfection with the CMV promoter construct (100 μg/ml) and 38 cells observed following transfection with the β-actin promoter construct (i.e. TRPC3high), not one cell exhibited store-operated entry (Fig. 2). Likewise, with a protocol that clearly reveals receptor-activated entry that is independent of store-depletion (i.e. in the absence of IP3 receptor, Fig. 4A), not one of 33 cells showed activation of entry following transfection with CMV-driven construct (i.e. TRPC3low) (10 μg/ml). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a channel protein functioning in two distinct ways depending on the expression level. The behavior observed at higher levels of expression confirms the findings of Venkatachalam et al. (15Venkatachalam K. Ma H.-T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and resolves this apparent contradiction in the literature. In addition, recent observations in our laboratory indicate that the expression of TRPC3 in DT40 cells, under low expression conditions, is also significantly lower than that in HEK293 cells wherein the channel is receptor activated.3 Yue et al. (26Yue L. Peng J.-B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) similarly suggested that a diminished level of expression favors a store-operated mechanism for the TRPV6 channel. In this case, store-operated behavior was observed only at very short times after transfection, and, with more prolonged times, an unregulated channel resulted (26Yue L. Peng J.-B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). What might be the basis for this change in channel behavior as a function of expression level? It is perhaps not surprising to see new and/or unusual behavior of proteins as their expression level is artificially increased, but it is somewhat more difficult to understand why a particular characteristic, in this instance regulation by store depletion, is lost. One possibility is that TRPC3 channels do not function alone when in store-operated mode but must associate with other proteins in proper stoichiometric arrangements. Dramatically increasing one member of such a signaling complex may increase the likelihood of forming incomplete complexes simply by dilution of a limited pool of accessory proteins provided by the cell. What might these additional proteins or factors be? Functional TRP-based channels are apparently tetramers (7Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 27Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Endogenous TRP-encoded channels may form heterotetramers, whereas it is expected that heterologously overexpressed channels mainly give raise to homotetramers (14Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28Wu X. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C526-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of TRPC subfamily members, Hofmann et al. (27Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TRPC3 can only form complexes with the closely related channels TRPC6 and/or TRPC7. However, interaction with proteins outside of the TRPC subfamily was not examined. In addition, other kinds of Ca2+ channels associate with subunits that are not necessarily a part of the pore-forming channels themselves (29Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 16: 521-555Crossref Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). It is not known whether such subunits are involved in the formation of functional TRPC channels. A final question is this. Which of the two modes of behavior represents the physiological function of TRPC3 channels? One might imagine that the behavior seen at the lowest expression level is likely to be the more physiologically relevant, but this need not necessarily be true. At the lower concentrations, TRPC3 may be imposing itself within a signaling structure into a role normally played by another somewhat related channel. There are reports in the literature of endogenous channels that could fit either behavior, e.g. store-operated non-selective cations channels (30Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7782-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), including the suggestion of a channel that can be regulated by both store-depletion and DAG (31Su Z. Csutora P. Hunton D. Shoemaker R.L. Marchase R.B. Blalock J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280 (-C1292): C1284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and receptor- and DAG-activated non-selective cation channels (32Tesfai Y. Brereton H.M. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 33Jung S. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus, for the moment, we may consider the intriguing possibility that either or even both of these TRPC3 behaviors correspond to a physiological mode of TRPC3 channel regulation, depending on the specific cellular environment. We are grateful to Drs. John O'Bryan and Carl Bortner for constructive comments and suggestions."

To localize the site of oxazolidinone action in the living cell, we have cross-linked a photoactive drug analog to its target in intact, actively growing Staphylococcus aureus.

Polypeptides cross-linked were the ribosomal protein L27, whose N terminus may reach the peptidyltransferase center, and LepA, a protein homologous to translation factors. Only ribosome-associated LepA, but not free protein, was cross-linked, indicating that LepA was cross-linked by the ribosome-bound antibiotic.

Antibiotics inhibit cell growth by binding to essential molecular components and interfering with their activity. Identification of the specific drug target is a critical starting point for understanding mechanism of action, possible resistance mechanisms, and for further rational drug refinement. Although one effective way to identify the target of antibiotics is by mapping drug resistance mutations, the majority of studies aimed at understanding the site and the mode of the drug action are generally carried out in vitro using biochemical techniques. Such studies, conducted with subcellular fractions, have on numerous occasions provided critical insights into understanding the mechanism of antibiotic activity. These biochemical approaches are based on a common assumption that interaction of the drug with its target in vitro closely resembles the one that takes place in the living cell. This assumption might not be valid for some antibiotics that interact with such a complex and dynamic macromolecular structure as the ribosome.A great variety of antibiotics inhibit bacterial growth by binding to the ribosome and interfering with its functions in protein synthesis. The ribosome, whose size exceeds that of an average antibiotic by four orders of magnitude, presents multiple possibilities for the antibiotic binding (1Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Carter A.P.

Albrecht R. Yonath A. Franceschi F. Nature. 2001; 413: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the course of translation, the ribosome cycles through various conformational states and interacts with a number of ligands and effectors, including tRNAs and translation factors, which affect the spatial structure of the ribosome (3Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 2002; 108: 557-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the affinity of antibiotics for specific sites in the ribosome might depend on the conformational state of the particle.Oxazolidinones are the first new class of antibiotics introduced into medical practice in 25 years. This class of protein synthesis inhibitors is extremely effective against Gram-positive bacteria (4Ford C.W. Hamel J.C. Wilson D.M. Moerman J.K. Stapert D. Yancey Jr., R.J. Hutchinson D.K.

In addition, these studies conducted with isolated ribosomes had pointed to possible interactions of oxazolidinones with A-864 in the 16 S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit. Lack of a clear understanding of the oxazolidinone binding site on the ribosome and reliance on indirect approaches led to the proposal of diverse models of oxazolidinone action (7Shinabarger D.L.

Biol. 2002; 322: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).One of the major limitations in studies of oxazolidinone action has been the low binding affinity of these compounds to isolated 70 S ribosomes or 50 S ribosomal subunits, e.g. 200 μm for eperezolid, one of the reference oxazolidinones (20Zhou C.C. Swaney S.M. Shinabarger D.L. Stockman B.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The low affinity binding to isolated ribosomes or ribosomal subunits limits the utility of standard footprinting techniques that are routinely used to identify potential direct interactions with rRNA (21Moazed D. Noller H.F. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1987; 327: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). In contrast to the low affinity of the drug for the “static” isolated ribosome, these drugs are potent inhibitors of cell-free translation, where eperezolid exhibits an IC50 of 2.5 μm in an Escherichia coli system (7Shinabarger D.L. Marotti K.R. Murray R.W. Lin A.H. Melchior E.P. Swaney S.M. Dunyak D.S. Demyan W.F. Buysse J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Brickner S.J.

Thus, the site of drug binding in purified non-translating ribosomes may not accurately represent the site responsible for the antibiotic activity. It is possible that the relevant site may transiently appear only in the dynamic structure of the ribosome engaged in protein synthesis.To bridge the information gained from biochemical experiments in vitro and genetic studies in vivo and to identify the site of oxazolidinone action in intact bacteria, we have used photo-induced cross-linking, a technique that is commonly used in vitro. However, in contrast to the previous studies, we have cross-linked a radioactive probe to its putative target in intact, actively growing bacteria. We reasoned that this approach applied to living cells would localize drug binding in vivo in the site relevant for its antibacterial activity. Moreover, we anticipated that this approach would succeed even if the relevant binding site were formed only transiently in the translating ribosome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Materials—All of the compounds used in this study were synthesized at Pharmacia Corp. by previously published methods (24Barbachyn M.R.

After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, the debris of the lysed cells was sedimented at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used for extraction of total RNA or for the isolation of ribosomes after ultracentrifugation at 450,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman TLA-100 ultracentrifuge (4 °C, TLA100 rotor).Isolation of Total RNA—An aliquot (180 μl) of cell lysate supernatant was diluted with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 6 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS to a volume of 250 μl, and RNA was extracted with phenol. The extracted RNA was precipitated by the addition of 400 μl of ethanol, and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried in vacuo, and either used directly for electrophoresis or subjected to primer extension or RNase H analysis. Electrophoresis of RNA was carried out either on 1% agarose gels or on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, dried, and exposed to BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.).Identification of 23 S rRNA Bases Cross-linked to Oxazolidinones— For the preliminary mapping of 23 S rRNA cross-links, total RNA prepared from the cross-linked sample was subjected to RNase H analysis (28Donis-Keller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 29Mankin A.S. Skripkin E.A. Chichkova N.V. Kopylov A.M. Bogdanov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) essentially as described by Dontsova et al. (30Dontsova O. Kopylov A. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2613-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In brief, 4 μg of total RNA was combined in 20 μl of water with 6 pmol of individual deoxyribooligonucleotides or pairs of deoxyribooligonucleotides complementary to sites in domains V and VI of S. aureus 23 S rRNA. The solution was incubated for 30 s at 90 °C and then cooled over 10 min to 50 °C. A 2.5-μl aliquot of 10× reaction buffer (150 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 500 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added followed by the addition of 1 μl of RNase H (Seikagaku America) in 2.5 μl of the 1× reaction buffer. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 55 °C, and RNA was precipitated by the addition of 100 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and 300 μl of ethanol. RNA was recovered by centrifuging for 10 min at 21,000 × g at 4 °C, resuspending in 7 μl of formamide loading dyes, heating for 30 s at 90 °C, and loading the sample onto a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gels (20 cm × 20 cm × 1 mm) were electrophoresed at 20 W for 1.5 h, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, dried, and exposed to a Phosphor-Imager screen (Molecular Dynamics).For precise mapping of the cross-linked nucleotides, the amount of 127I-XL (in this case non-radioactive) added to S. aureus cells was increased to 2 mm. Oligonucleotide primers were 5′-terminally labeled, annealed to RNA, and extended with reverse transcriptase as described (31Merryman C. Noller H.F. Smith C.W.J. RNA: Protein Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 237-253Google Scholar).The following oligonucleotides were used for RNase H mapping and primer extension (numbers in parentheses correspond to the 23 S rRNA complementary sequence, E. coli numbering): SaL 2550, GCCGACATCGAGGTGCC (2494–2510); SaL 2720, GTCCATCCCGGTCCTCTCGTAC (2655–2676); SaL 2230, TAGTATCCCACCAGCGTCTC (2157–2176); SaL2340, ACCTTTGAGCGCCTCCG (2275–2291); EcL 2563, TCGCGTACCACTTTA (2563–2577).Isolation and Identification of Cross-linked Proteins—Ribosomal pellets were resuspended in 70 μl of ribosome buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm NH4Cl, 30 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4)). Two volumes of glacial acetic acid were added, and the tubes were mixed for 15 min at 4 °C before the precipitated RNA was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was brought to 80% acetone and stored overnight at–20 °C. The acetone pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 18,000 × g, washed with cold acetone to remove residual acetic acid, and lyophilized (32Barritault D. Expert-Bezancon A. Guerin M.F. Hayes D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Adams (33Adams L. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Lyophilized protein pellets were resuspended in 35 μl of buffer containing 9 m urea, 4% Nonidet P-40, 1% dithiothreitol, and 2% pH 3.5–10 ampholytes. Samples were applied to isoelectric focusing tube gels and focused for 23,000 volt-hours. Second-dimension gels were 10–20% non-linear gradients run in Tris-glycine-SDS buffer (Bio-Rad). Gels were silver-stained (34Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar), dried, and exposed to Kodak Biomax film.High performance liquid chromatography separation of the extracted ribosomal proteins was carried out on a Vydac 218TPT C18 column according to a modified procedure of Cooperman et al. (35Cooperman B.S. Weitzmann C.J. Buck M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The elution (1 ml/min) started with 75% A (water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, v/v), 25% B (acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, v/v). Buffer B proportion was increased from 25 to 80% over a 100-min linear gradient.Protein Identification—The specifically cross-linked proteins were excised from the gels, reduced, alkylated, and digested in situ with modified porcine trypsin (Promega) using a DigestPro robot (LC Packings). Nano liquid chromatography (nanoLC) tandem mass spectrometry analysis (nanoLC-MS/MS) was performed on a Micromass Q-Tof instrument equipped with a Z-spray ion source. Nanospray MS/MS data was used to identify proteins by comparing the experimental data with predicted data derived from protein and DNA databases. Tandem MS data was searched against the NCBInr and HGS protein databases using MASCOT (Matrix Science) programs maintained on an in-house server.Targeted Disruption of LepA Gene—The LepA knock-out strain of S. aureus (RN4220) was constructed by insertional mutagenesis using an E. coli vector construct that is incapable of replication in S. aureus. A 310-bp region at the 5′ end of the S. aureus LepA gene (yqeQ) was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA using a pair of primers, CTCGATTATAGCACATATTGAC and TTTGTGCTTCGATACCTTGAG, and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) to create pCR-yqeQ-N310 plasmid. An ermB gene that confers erythromycin resistance in S. aureus was cloned into the NotI site of the pCR-yqeQ-N310 plasmid, and the resulting construct was electroporated into S. aureus (36Schenk S. Laddaga R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 94: 133-138Crossref Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from several erythromycin-resistant colonies, and yqeQ gene disruption was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. The lack of LepA expression in the constructed strain was confirmed by Western blot analysis using LepA-specific rabbit antibodies (Covance).RESULTSIn Vivo Cross-linking of Oxazolidinones to Ribosomal RNA— The structures of the oxazolidinones used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. In addition to the photosensitive probe (125I-XL), the structures are shown for the compounds used for competition, eperezolid (PNU-100592(S) and its inactive enantiomer, PNU-107112(R) as well as for linezolid (Zyvox®, PNU-100766), the first clinically approved oxazolidinone. With the exception of PNU-107112(R), all compounds were active against S. aureus (MIC values of 0.7–10 μm). All of the compounds contained the central oxazolidinone ring, the main pharmacophore of this group of drugs (24Barbachyn M.R. Brickner S.J. Gadwood R.C. Garmon S.A. Grega K.C. Hutchinson D.K. Munesada K. Reischer R.J. Taniguchi M. Thomasco L.M. Toops D.S. Yamada H. Ford C.W. Zurenko G.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 456: 219-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 125I-XL, the compound used in cross-linking experiments, contained the photoactive azido group.For cross-linking in vivo, exponentially growing S. aureus cells were incubated with the 125I-XL photoprobe with or without competitor compounds for 30 min (optimal under these conditions) to allow drug penetration into the cell and binding to the target. To determine the specificity of the interaction, parallel incubations contained a 20-fold excess of non-photoactive competitors, active PNU-100592(S), or the control, inactive enantiomer PNU-107112(R) (Fig. 1). After these incubations, 125I-XL was cross-linked to its target by brief exposure to UV light (see “Experimental Procedures”).Extraction and electrophoresis of RNA from S. aureus cells that had been incubated with 125I-XL demonstrated that 23 S rRNA and tRNA were labeled selectively by the photoprobe (Fig. 2). Electrophoresis of the RNA on 1% agarose gels (Fig. 2A) clearly resolved 23 S, 16 S, and 5 S RNA. The 125I probe was cross-linked only to 23 S rRNA; no radioactive drug was seen associated with 16 S rRNA even upon prolonged exposure of the dried gels to film. Cross-linking of 125I-XL to 23 S rRNA likely occurred from the site of its inhibitory action because the yield of the cross-link was significantly reduced in the presence of an active drug PNU-100592(S) but not by its inactive enantiomer PNU-107112(R). (Fig. 2, lanes S and R). Separation of the extracted RNA by polyacrylamide electrophoresis (Fig. 2B) demonstrated that although no drug cross-linked to 5S rRNA, some amount of 125I-XL (much smaller than seen associated with 23 S rRNA) also cross-linked to RNA molecules co-migrating with tRNA. Specific cross-linking of biologically active 125I-XL to 23 S rRNA indicated that in their binding site in the large ribosomal subunit oxazolidinones form close contacts with certain residues of 23 S rRNA and possibly ribosome-bound tRNA.Fig. 2Analysis of RNA isolated from intact S. aureus cross-linked by [125]I-XL by agarose gel electrophoresis (A) or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (B). Exponentially growing S. aureus cells were cross-linked with 2 μm [125]I-XL alone (lane C) or in the presence of a 20-fold excess of biologically active non-cross-linkable competitor (lane S) or its inactive enantiomer (lane R).

Panel B is a similar representation of the separation on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To map the approximate site(s) of 125I-XL cross-linking to 23 S rRNA, RNase H mapping was utilized (28Donis-Keller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 29Mankin A.S. Skripkin E.A. Chichkova N.V. Kopylov A.M. Bogdanov A.A.

Total RNA prepared from cross-linked S. aureus cells was incubated with oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to specific regions of 23 S rRNA (Fig. 3A). The RNA in the formed DNA/RNA heteroduplex was cleaved with RNase H, and the resulting fragments were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis and identified by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3B, when cross-linked 23 S rRNA was cleaved with RNase H in the presence of oligonucleotide SaL 2550, complementary to the rRNA segment 2494–2510 (E. coli numbering), an ∼400-nucleotide-long radiolabeled 23 S rRNA fragment representing the 3′ end of 23 S rRNA was released. No label was found associated with the longer 5′ segment. Digestion of 23 S rRNA with RNase H in the presence of two oligonucleotides, SaL 2550 and SaL 2720 (23 S rRNA positions 2655–2676), released a single radiolabeled rRNA fragment ∼170 nucleotides long corresponding to the rRNA segment between the two oligonucleotides. Thus, 125I-XL was cross-linked exclusively to the 2494–2676 segment of 23 S rRNA.Fig. 3Identification of the site of in vivo 23 S RNA cross-linking by [125I]-XL.A, the relative location of the primers (thin bars) complementary to 23 S rRNA (thick bar) used in RNase H mapping. The approximate sizes of the RNA fragments produced by RNase H cleavage are indicated.

An arrow indicates the nucleotide residue corresponding to the cross-linked position.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The precise location of the cross-link was mapped by primer extension. A single additional band at position 2603 was seen when the rRNA sample prepared from cells incubated with non-radioactive 127I-XL was used as a template (Fig. 3C), corresponding to the drug cross-link at position A-2602. As expected from the results with the radioactive probe, the intensity of this band decreased when the cross-linking was prevented by incubation in the presence of a 20-fold excess of PNU-100592(S) in vivo. Thus, the single rRNA base cross-linked by the photoprobe in actively growing bacteria was A-2602.A-2602 is one of the central nucleotides in the ribosomal peptidyltransferase center (38Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Thus, cross-linking of the oxazolidinone photoprobe to A-2602 places the site of the drug action in the peptidyltransferase center.Oxazolidinone Cross-linking to Ribosome-associated Proteins in Vivo—To investigate possible in vivo cross-linking of 125I-XL to ribosome-associated proteins, ribosomes were pelleted from the lysates of S. aureus cells cross-linked with the drug, and proteins were fractionated by SDS electrophoresis. SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteins in the ribosome pellet demonstrated two radiolabeled protein bands of ∼64 and 11 kDa that were selectively cross-linked (Fig. 4A). The 125I-XL cross-linking to these the proteins showed the same specificity as was seen for the 23 S RNA in these samples; cross-linking was reduced in the presence of the biologically active competitor eperezolid, PNU-100592(S), but not by its inacti"
https://openalex.org/W2003721745,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Only 15% of patients with this disease survive 5 years or longer. Early metastatic spread is the single most important reason for this poor outcome. The survival of patients with pathological stage I disease, that is, no evidence for metastatic spread, and molecular aberrations on chromosome 11p15.5 is equal to that of patients with stage II disease, that is, metastatic spread to hilar lymph nodes. RRM1 is a gene in this region, and it is haploinsufficient in at least 34% stage I patients. Here, we show that overexpression of RRM1 in human and mouse lung cancer cell lines induced PTEN expression, reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), suppressed migration, invasion, and metastasis formation, and increased survival in an animal model. Increased PTEN expression was required for the RRM1-induced suppression of cell motility and FAK phosphorylation. We conclude that RRM1 functions as a metastasis suppressor gene through induction of PTEN expression."
https://openalex.org/W1966867282,"Erythrocyte invasion by the malaria merozoite is accompanied by the regulated discharge of apically located secretory organelles called micronemes. Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 (PfAMA-1), which plays an indispensable role in invasion, translocates from micronemes onto the parasite surface and is proteolytically shed in a soluble form during invasion. We have previously proposed, on the basis of incomplete mass spectrometric mapping data, that PfAMA-1 shedding results from cleavage at two alternative positions. We now show conclusively that the PfAMA-1 ectodomain is shed from the merozoite solely as a result of cleavage at a single site, just 29 residues away from the predicted transmembrane-spanning sequence. Remarkably, this cleavage is mediated by the same membrane-bound parasite serine protease as that responsible for shedding of the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) complex, an abundant, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored multiprotein complex. Processing of MSP-1 is essential for invasion. Our results indicate the presence on the merozoite surface of a multifunctional serine sheddase with a broad substrate specificity. We further demonstrate that translocation and shedding of PfAMA-1 is an actin-independent process.

We further demonstrate that translocation and shedding of PfAMA-1 is an actin-independent process. Apicomplexan parasites possess specialized zoite stages primarily designed to invade host cells. Most zoites are extracellular only transiently, but this relatively vulnerable stage in the parasite life cycle is widely considered a target for drug or vaccine-based interventions aimed at controlling parasite replication. Invasion is accompanied by dramatic proteolytic modification of zoite surface proteins. These proteins broadly divide into two classes on the basis of their trafficking pathway. Resident surface proteins are sorted directly to the plasma membrane of the intracellular developing zoite and are often characterized by the presence of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; ALLM, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal; AMA-1, apical membrane antigen-1; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate; DCI, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin; DTT, dithiothreitol; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; MSP-1, merozoite surface protein-1; PfAMA-1, P. falciparum apical merozoite antigen-1; pHMB, para-hydroxymercuribenzoate; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; TLCK, N-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethylketone; TM, transmembrane; TPCK, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone; Z-GML-CH2Cl, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Met-Leu-chloromethylketone. membrane anchor, or by being peripherally associated with a GPI-anchored protein. A well studied example of this class is merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1). Synthesized as a large precursor protein, it exists on the free Plasmodium falciparum merozoite as a complex of four proteolytic fragments, additionally associated with protein products of two distinct genes (1Pachebat J.A. Ling I.T. Grainger M. Trucco C. Howell S. Fernandez-Reyes D. Gunaratne R. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 83-89Google Scholar). The entire complex is held on the parasite surface via interactions with a single, GPI-anchored polypeptide derived from the C-terminal end of the MSP-1 precursor. At erythrocyte invasion this is proteolytically cleaved in a process called secondary processing (reviewed in Ref. 2Blackman M.J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2000; 1: 59-83Google Scholar) to form two products, MSP-133 and MSP-119. MSP-133 is shed quantitatively, still bound to the rest of the complex, whereas MSP-119, which consists of two epidermal growth factor (epidermal growth factor)-like domains, remains on the invading parasite surface. The protease responsible is a membrane-bound calcium-dependent merozoite serine protease. MSP-1 is a conserved Plasmodium molecule, and the processing step is similarly conserved. Upon successful invasion it always goes to completion. When processing is inhibited, invasion cannot occur, making it a potential target for protease inhibitor-based drug development. Invasion by apicomplexan zoites also involves regulated release of secretory organelles within the anterior domain of the parasite, called rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules. Several microneme proteins translocate onto the parasite surface, where they form a second class of induced or transiently expressed surface proteins. They are thought to act in many cases as adhesive ligands promoting the interaction between parasite and target host cell (3Tomley F. Soldati D. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 81-86Google Scholar, 4Blackman M.J. Bannister L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 11-25Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that for productive invasion, these adhesins must eventually be released from the parasite surface by regulated proteolysis (see, e.g., Ref. 5Brossier F. Jewett T.J. Lovett J.L. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6229-6234Google Scholar). Apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) was first identified as a target of monoclonal antibodies (mAb), which prevent erythrocyte invasion by merozoites of the simian malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi (6Deans J.A. Alderson T. Thomas A.W. Mitchell G.H. Lennox E.S. Cohen S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1982; 49: 297-309Google Scholar). Homologues of AMA-1 are present in all species of Plasmodium examined, as well as in other apicomplexans. Unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the gene in Plasmodium blood stages (7Triglia T. Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Google Scholar) and Toxoplasma gondii asexual stages (8Hehl A.B. Lekutis C. Grigg M.E. Bradley P.J. Dubremetz J.F. Ortega-Barria E. Boothroyd J.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7078-7086Google Scholar) indicate that it has an essential function in this part of the parasite life cycle. Replacement of the P. falciparum ama-1 gene with the divergent Plasmodium chabaudi homologue produced transgenic parasites which invaded mouse erythrocytes more efficiently than wild type P. falciparum (7Triglia T. Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Google Scholar). These observations, together with the now numerous reports of in vivo protection or inhibition of host cell invasion by antibodies (see, e.g., Ref. 9Kocken C.H. Withers-Martinez C. Dubbeld M.A. van der Wel A. Hackett F. Blackman M.J. Thomas A.W. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4471-4476Google Scholar) or by peptides (10Li F. Dluzewski A. Coley A.M. Thomas A.W. Tilley L. Anders R.F. Foley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50303-50310Google Scholar) that bind to the AMA-1 ectodomain, implicate AMA-1 in invasion. All Plasmodium AMA-1 sequences contain 16 completely conserved cysteine residues (Fig. 1), most of which are also positionally conserved in the T. gondii AMA-1 (11Donahue C.G. Carruthers V.B. Gilk S.D. Ward G.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 15-30Google Scholar). The disulfide bonding pattern between these cysteines (12Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Matthew M.L. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Anders R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29446-29452Google Scholar) and limited structural analysis (13Nair M. Hinds M. Coley A. Hodder A. Foley M. Anders R. Norton R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 741-753Google Scholar) suggests that the AMA-1 ectodomain contains three domains, each stabilized by intradomain disulfide bonds. AMA-1 is secreted from micronemes onto the parasite surface and shed in a soluble form following parasite release from the host cell (8Hehl A.B. Lekutis C. Grigg M.E. Bradley P.J. Dubremetz J.F.

Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar). This entire process involves at least two sequential proteolytic processing events. In the case of P. falciparum AMA-1 (PfAMA-1), transport to its initial apical location is quickly followed by the loss of an N-terminal pro-sequence, which extends from the secretory signal cleavage site to residue Ser96 (16Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Google Scholar, 17Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar). The truncated protein (but not the full-length precursor), still in possession of its transmembrane (TM) anchoring sequence, is then translocated onto the parasite surface in the form of a 66-kDa species called PfAMA-166, and is finally quantitatively shed as a result of further proteolysis. On the basis of incomplete mass spectrometric peptide mapping data, we previously proposed that the shed protein took two forms: one (called PfAMA-148 in reference to its apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa on SDS-PAGE) that was concluded to represent the bulk of the ectodomain, being the product of a membrane-proximal cleavage of PfAMA-166; and a second form called PfAMA-144, which was thought to represent a product of cleavage of PfAMA-166 at some unidentified point between domains II and III (17Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar). We now report the results of a detailed extension of this earlier study. Our new data provide a definitive description of proteolytic processing of PfAMA-1, cast new light on the mechanism by which PfAMA-1 is translocated onto the merozoite surface, and reveal a previously unsuspected link between shedding of PfAMA-1 and secondary processing of MSP-1. Materials—Sequencing grade proteases and calpain inhibitors N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal (ALLM) were from Roche Diagnostics Ltd. [35S]Methionine/cysteine (Pro-mix™) was from Amersham Biosciences. 18O water was from Isotec (CK Gas Products Ltd.). The metalloprotease inhibitor TAPI-2 was from BIOMOL. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) was from Pentapharm Ltd. (Basel, Switzerland). Cytochalasin D and B, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1,3-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI), N-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethylketone (TLCK), N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone (TPCK), para-hydroxymercuribenzoate (pHMB), and all other protease inhibitors were from Sigma. A proprietary combinatorial library of 2672 random drug-like compounds was a kind gift of Evotec OAI (Abingdon, Oxford, United Kingdom (UK)). Compounds were screened for inhibition of MSP-1 secondary processing at a concentration of 100 μm, using the Western blot-based assay described previously (18Blackman M.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 213-220Google Scholar). This identified two compounds, 239f and 2312f, which inhibit both MSP-1 processing and erythrocyte invasion in vitro with IC50 values in the low micromolar range (data not shown). Synthesis of the peptidyl chloromethylketone N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Met-Leu-CH2Cl (Z-GML-CH2Cl) was by the mixed anhydride method (19Powers J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 46: 197-208Google Scholar); complete details of the synthesis and characterization will be provided elsewhere. 2I. Wells and M. Blackman, manuscript in preparation. Design of this compound was based on the sequence flanking the secondary processing site within the P. falciparum MSP-1 (20Blackman M.J. Chappel J.A. Shai S. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 103-114Google Scholar). The compound inhibits both MSP-1 secondary processing and erythrocyte invasion with an IC50 value of ∼30 μm. It is also a potent inhibitor of subtilisin BPN′ and chymotrypsin, but does not significantly inhibit elastase, trypsin or the P. falciparum subtilisin-like protease PfSUB-1 (21Withers-Martinez C. Saldanha J.W. Ely B. Hackett F. O'Connor T. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29698-29709Google Scholar) at the highest concentrations tested (500 μm). 3M. Blackman, unpublished data. Parasites and Antibodies—Culture and synchronization of P. falciparum (clone 3D7) was as previously described (18Blackman M.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 213-220Google Scholar). Routinely, parasites were maintained in complete medium containing the serum substitute Albumax, although where indicated protein-free medium was employed. Mature schizonts were isolated by centrifugation on cushions of 63% isotonic Percoll, and either biosynthetically radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (22Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H.L. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Google Scholar) or used for preparation of naturally released merozoites for use in processing assays as previously described (18Blackman M.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 213-220Google Scholar). Purification of mAb 4G2dc1, which recognizes a conformational epitope within the PfAMA-1 ectodomain (23Kocken C.H. van der Wel A.M. Dubbeld M.A. Narum D.L. van de Rijke F.M. van Gemert G.-J. van der Linde X. Bannister L.H. Janse C. Waters A.P. Thomas A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15119-15124Google Scholar), was as described previously (17Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar). The human mAb X509, which recognizes an epitope within the 3D7 MSP-133, has been described (20Blackman M.J. Chappel J.A. Shai S. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 103-114Google Scholar). The RAP-1-specific mAb 209.3 was a kind gift of Dr. A. Holder (National Institute of Medical Research, London, UK). A mouse antiserum was raised against reduced, alkylated recombinant PfAMA-1 (9Kocken C.H. Withers-Martinez C. Dubbeld M.A. van der Wel A. Hackett F. Blackman M.J. Thomas A.W. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4471-4476Google Scholar) using standard protocols. Purification and Immunoprecipitation of Shed PfAMA-1—Shed forms of PfAMA-1 were purified from parasite culture supernatants. Briefly, Percoll-enriched mature schizonts (unlabeled or biosynthetically radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine) were recultured for up to 11 h in the presence or absence of fresh erythrocytes to allow merozoite release and reinvasion. Culture supernatants (referred to as schizont rupture supernatants) were then harvested and clarified by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled material and analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography was as described previously (22Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H.L. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Grainger M. Hackett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Google Scholar). Quantitation of radioactivity associated with selected bands on dried gels was performed with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager, using ImageQuant® version 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics). All immunoprecipitations used mAb 4G2dc1 coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). An affinity column for larger scale purification was produced as described previously (17Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar). Clarified culture supernatant (up to 3 liters at a time) was applied to the column at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1 at 4 °C. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm CHAPS in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, and finally with the same buffer without CHAPS. Bound proteins were eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.7, and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 150 mm NaCl. Alternatively, protein eluted from the affinity column was applied to a Vydac 4.6 mm × 15-cm C4 reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) column equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted at 1 ml min–1 with a 0–54% (v/v) gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min, monitoring elution at 215 nm. Eluate samples were dried under vacuum for further analysis by RP-HPLC, SDS-PAGE, or mass spectrometry. For re-application of samples to the RP-HPLC column following reduction and alkylation, dried samples from the first round of RP-HPLC purification were taken up in 100 μl of 8 m urea in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 50 mm DTT, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Iodoacetamide was then added to 100 mm and incubation continued for an additional 20 min at 37 °C in the dark. Samples were made up to 1 ml with 0.2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water, re-applied to the C4 RP-HPLC column, and eluted using the protocol described above. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS)—RP-HPLC-purified protein was dried under vacuum. Where previously reduced and alkylated, samples were simply taken up directly into 60% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and submitted to mass spectrometry. Where not previously reduced, protein was taken up in 6.25% (v/v) acetonitrile in 5 mm NH4HCO3, supplemented with DTT to 50 mm, and incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature to allow complete reduction. Samples were then acidified with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and analyzed on a Platform single quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altringham, UK) as described previously (17Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar). Proteolytic Digestion and Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Purified PfAMA-144 and PfAMA-148 proteins purified in the absence of prior reduction were solubilized directly into SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.1 m DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then submitted to in-gel proteolytic digestion as described previously (17Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar). Alternatively, dried peaks from RP-HPLC fractionation of reduced and alkylated protein were taken up directly into protease digestion buffer. Digestion with Lys-C was performed in 5 mm NH4HCO3, using the enzyme at 2.5–5.0 ng μl–1, whereas digestion with Glu-C was in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, using the enzyme at 10 ng μl–1. Where required, digestion buffers were prepared using 50% (v/v) 18O water. After overnight digestion at 32 °C, the digestion supernatant was acidified by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to 0.4% (v/v) before analysis on a Reflex-III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) as described previously (17Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar). Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 150 mm NaCl was calibrated with marker proteins ferritin (440 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Blue dextran 2000 was used to determine the void volume (Vo) of the column. Schizont rupture supernatants were obtained from schizonts cultured for 4 h in protein-free medium. Freshly harvested supernatants were concentrated 20-fold by centrifugation in a 12-kDa molecular mass cut-off Vectaspin Micro ultrafiltration unit (Whatman), and 50 μl applied at once to the gel filtration column. The column was eluted at 0.4 ml min–1. Fractions of 0.4 ml were collected and assayed for the presence of PfAMA-1-derived fragments by Western blot using the mouse anti-PfAMA-1 antiserum. Immunofluorescence—Percoll-enriched mature schizonts were recultured for 1 h in fresh medium containing cytochalasin D (final concentration 2 μm, added from a 2 mm stock solution in Me2SO) or Me2SO only, to allow merozoite release. Residual intact schizonts and released merozoites were then pelleted by centrifugation (6500 × g, 1 min at room temperature). Thin films were air-dried, fixed in ice-cold acetone, and probed sequentially with mAb 4G2dc1, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), and the RAP-1-specific mAb 209.3 which had been directly conjugated to Texas Red as described previously (24Blackman M.J. Dennis E.D. Hirst E.M. Kocken C.H. Scott-Finnigan T.J. Thomas A.W. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 229-239Google Scholar). Slides were dipped in a solution of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and mounted in Citifluor (Citifluor UKC Chemical Laboratories, Canterbury, UK). The cells were visualized on an integrated DeltaVision system (Applied Precision) including an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope with a 100× objective. Images were captured with a Micromax air-cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) on a Silicon Graphics Iris work station, using Softworx image acquisition and deconvolution software. The C Terminus of PfAMA-144Lies within Domain III of PfAMA-1—In previous attempts to determine the precise site(s) at which PfAMA-1 is cleaved to release it from the merozoite, shed fragments were isolated and subjected to proteolytic digestion in the presence of 50% (v/v) 18O water. Under these conditions, peptide products of digestion incorporate both 18O and 16O at their terminal α-carboxyl group as a result of serine protease-mediated hydrolysis (25Schnolzer M. Jedrzejewski P. Lehmann W.D. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 945-953Google Scholar). Such peptides possess a distinctive isotope pattern in MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and are distinguishable from any peptide derived from the extreme C terminus of the polypeptide substrate, which should exhibit a normal 16O isotope spectrum. No peptide of the latter type was evident in 18O-containing chymotryptic or tryptic digests of PfAMA-144 and PfAMA-148 (17Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar), suggesting that the C-terminal products of digestion by these proteases were too small or not sufficiently basic to be detected by MALDI-TOF. We extended this approach, using an expanded range of proteolytic enzymes. When affinity-purified PfAMA-144 was digested with endoproteinase Glu-C in the presence of 50% (v/v) 18O water, MALDI-TOF analysis (data not shown) now readily identified a single unlabeled species of m/z 858.52. This can only correspond to the predicted Glu-C peptide with the sequence S458KRIKLN464 (calculated m/z 858.55). This result was unexpected; the sequence lies just downstream of Cys443, the first cysteine of domain III (Fig. 1), and therefore indicated that, rather than lying between domains II and III as previously concluded, the C terminus of PfAMA-144 actually lies within domain III. Hodder et al. (12Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Matthew M.L. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Anders R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29446-29452Google Scholar) have demonstrated unequivocally that all 16 cysteine residues in recombinant P. chabaudi AMA-1 are engaged in disulfide bonds, and that the first cysteine of domain III (Cys443 in the 3D7 PfAMA-1 sequence) is disulfide-bonded to Cys502, which lies in the middle of a cluster of 5 cysteines within the C-terminal part of domain III. An NMR study of recombinant domain III (13Nair M. Hinds M. Coley A. Hodder A. Foley M. Anders R. Norton R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 741-753Google Scholar) has confirmed this assignment. Assuming that this disulfide-bond architecture holds true for authentic PfAMA-1, cleavage at Asn464 could not alone be sufficient to release PfAMA-144 from the merozoite surface, because the cleaved fragment would remain attached to the still membrane-bound C-terminal part of domain III via this single disulfide bond, i.e. the cleavage which produces the C terminus of PfAMA-144 cannot be the same as that which releases it from the merozoite. This new insight forced a reevaluation of our previous model. We postulated the new hypothesis that only the membrane-proximal cleavage is responsible for releasing PfAMA-1 from the merozoite membrane, and that the shed protein likely takes two forms: PfAMA-148, comprising a single polypeptide extending from Ile97 up to this membrane-proximal cleavage site; and a second species, which is identical to PfAMA-148 except for the presence of an internal “nick” within domain III, at Asn464. This nick would produce PfAMA-144, still bound to the remainder of domain III via the single disulfide bond (Fig. 1). Subsequent experiments focused on testing this hypothesis. PfAMA-144Is Disulfide-bonded to a Short C-terminal Polypeptide Fragment with a C Terminus Identical to That of PfAMA-148—SDS-PAGE of immunoprecipitated PfAMA-144 and PfAMA-148 showed that the difference in molecular mass between the two species is reduction-dependent (Fig. 2A); in the absence of DTT, the two proteins co-migrate. This is consistent with PfAMA-144 being disulfide-bound to another species, which, together with PfAMA-144, approximates the total mass of PfAMA-148. Under reducing conditions, this peptide would dissociate and migrate at the solvent front on SDS-PAGE and so would not be readily detectable. To identify it, and to better analyze the structure of the shed species, larger amounts of protein were isolated on a mAb 4G2dc1 affinity column (Fig. 2B, left-hand lane), then further purified by gel filtration or RP-HPLC. The PfAMA-144 and PfAMA-148 species co-migrated precisely on both the gel filtration column (Fig. 2C) and on the RP-HPLC column (Fig. 2D), where the elution profile was characterized by a single major peak with a retention time of 43.5 min. A sample of the gel filtration peak (fraction 39 in Fig. 2C) was reduced and analyzed directly by ESI-MS. Only two species were detectable (Fig. 3), one of molecular mass 48,336.85 ± 5.17 Da, probably representing PfAMA-148 (the major component of the mixture on SDS-PAGE), and the second of molecular mass 6040.97 ± 1.19 Da. Identical results were obtained upon ESI-MS analysis of the RP-HPLC peak (data not shown). Comparison of the high molecular mass signal with the predicted 3D7 PfAMA-1 sequence suggests that, if it corresponds to PfAMA-148, the species extends from its previously determined N-terminal residue of Ile97 through to Thr517 (the calculated mass of this sequence is 48,341.75 Da). The lower mass signal corresponds closely to the predicted mass of Asp465–Thr517 of the PfAMA-1 sequence (predicted m/z of the reduced, non-alkylated sequence is 6038.87), suggesting that this is the sequence of the peptide hypothesized to be disulfide-bonded to PfAMA-144. PfAMA-144 was not detected, probably because of the fact that this is always present at substantially lower levels than PfAMA-148, as noted previously (17Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Google Scholar), and its charge envelope was likely obscured by that of the more abundant species. This issue is returned to below. A further sample of the RP-HPLC-purified PfAMA-144 and PfAMA-148 mixture was taken up in 8 m urea, reduced and alkylated to dissociate any disulfide-dependent interactions, then re-applied to the C4 RP-HPLC column. Three peaks were now evident, with retention times of 31.6, 43.6, and 45.5 min (Fig. 4A). SDS-PAGE of the major peak (data not shown) demonstrated that it contained both PfAMA-144 and PfAMA-148, presumably in fully alkylated form. The minor peak at 43.6 min was also found on SDS-PAGE (data not shown) to contain both PfAMA-144 and PfAMA-148, probably representing residual unmodified material. The peak at 31.6 min was examined directly by ESI-MS. A single, strong signal of molecular mass 6324.91 ± 0.48 Da was detected, which corresponds closely to the predicted mass (6325.2 Da) of the carbamidomethylated form of Asp465–Thr517 of the 3D7 PfAMA-1 sequence. A sample of this material was digested with Lys-C in 50% (v/v) 18O water and analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 4B). A strong but simple spectrum was obtained, comprising only seven major ions. All derived from sequence between Asp465 and Thr517 of PfAMA-1 ("

CD2 is a T and NK cell surface protein that mediates low affinity cell-cell interactions by binding to related immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) proteins, CD58 in humans and CD48 in rodents (reviewed in Ref. 1Davis S.J.

Protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF were added immediately prior to use. The lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 60 min and then clarified at 10,000 × g (13,000 rpm) in a Microfuge or 2,000 × g (3,000 rpm) in a Beckman benchtop GPR centrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min and then filtered (0.45 μm). Streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway) were washed once in PBS before being saturated with biotinylated peptides. At least 20-fold excess peptide (16 μg) over the bead (25 μl at 10 mg/ml) capacity was used. After 30 min at 4 °C beads were washed twice in PBS. 25 μl of beads and 2.5 × 108 cell equivalents of lysate were used for each lane of the gel. The control beads were saturated with d-Biotin in at least 100-fold excess. The beads were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C in the lysate, transferred to new tubes, and washed three times with 200 μl of PBS in a Dynal MPC-E magnetic particle concentrator with a change of tube during each wash. Washed beads were resuspended in 10 μl of NuPAGE SDS sample buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA), reduced with 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol, vortexed, and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. The beads were pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and supernatant was run on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Novex) in an X-Cell II gel tank (Novex) using MOPS SDS running buffer (Novex). The gels were stained with Coomassie, and the protein bands were excised from the gel and analyzed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry (10Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). After overnight trypsin digestion, the peptides were extracted twice with 30 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid. Finally, the dried peptide solution was resuspended in 10 μl of H2O. MALDI Mass Spectrometry—0.5 μl of saturated 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in H2O was mixed on-target with 0.5 μl of sample and dried. Peptide mass fingerprints were acquired on a REFLEX III mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Coventry, UK). The spectra were internally or externally calibrated (Calibration Mixture 2 from a Sequazyme kit, Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Data interpretation was carried out using the Prospector Suite of search programs (prospector.ucsf.edu/). Peak lists from MALDI spectra were input into MS-Fit, and the NCBI nonredundant protein data base was searched. Constructs—Maltose-binding protein fusion proteins were constructed using the pMAL-c2X vector (www.neb.com). Templates CMS (11Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and CIN85 (12Take H. Watanabe S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) for amplification by PCR using cloned Pfu polymerase were provided by K. Kirsch and S. Kaijigaya, respectively. The fragments were cloned in-frame into vector cut with BamHI and SalI. SH3 domains with 5′ BamHI and 3′ SalI sites lacked the initiator Met and contained a stop codon after the following C-terminal sequences CIN85-SH3, FVKLLPP; CMS-SH3d1, KEIKRE; and CIN85-SH3d1, REIKKE. C-terminal regions were cloned using an engineered 5′ BamHI site for CIN85-C, a natural BglII site for CMS-C, and a XhoI site after the stop codon producing the following N-terminal sequences after the junction with pMAL: CMS-CC, IVEALK; CMS-C, SGTVYP; and CIN85-C, GALPPR. CD2BP1-SH3 was amplified from human PBL cDNA and fused to pMAL, the sequence codons for SPAQEY following the BamHI site and with a SalI site after the stop codon. In the T cell hybridoma, PLEGFP-C1 (www.clontech.com) was used for expression of EGFP fused to CD2AP-C, a HindIII (1078 bp)-XhoI (2426 bp) restriction fragment of CD2AP (M. Dustin and A. Shaw, St. Louis, MO), CD2AP-SH3d1-CC (CMS and CD2AP SH3d1 are identical, CD2AP terminology is used in the mouse experiments) constructed in two steps using a 3′ primer containing adjacent BglII and HindIII sites. The intermediate vector was cut with BglII and SalI, and the CMS-CC fragment was inserted, which produced the joining sequence ERSIVE. CMS-CC was also inserted into pLEGFP-C1 to provide a dimeric EGFP control. A mouse CD2 pBabe construct was made by Anna Cambiaggi. Proteins—pMAL fusion proteins were expressed and affinity-purified using standard procedures with amylose resin (www.neb.com). SH3 constructs were further purified by gel filtration using Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences). Chicken CAPZ α1β1, which was the first CAPZ available to us was expressed using a construct provided by T. Obinata (13Soeno Y. Abe H. Kimura S. Maruyama K. Obinata T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and purified from bacterial lysates containing 0.15 m NaCl by ion exchange on Q Sepharose using a binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05 m NaCl and eluted with the same buffer and increasing NaCl concentration, with CAPZ eluting at about 0.4 m NaCl. A single peak containing the heterodimeric CAPZ was isolated by gel filtration on Superdex 200. Human erythrocyte CAPZ was provided by P. Khulman (14Kuhlman P.A. Fowler V.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13461-13472Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Attempts to produce full-length CMS and CIN85 in bacteria as pMAL fusion proteins and in insect cells with a His-biotin tag were hampered by low level expression and degradation and not pursued. Confirmatory sequencing of all constructs was obtained using Big-Dye™ (ABI) Sanger dideoxynucleotide method on a Prism 377 DNA or 3100 Genetic Analyzer sequencer (ABI). Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The concentrations were estimated by absorption at 280 nm in a 1-cm flow cell using theoretical extinction coefficients for the pMAL fusion proteins: CMS-SH3d1 = 74,250 m–1 cm–1 and CIN85-SH3d1 = 77,380 m–1 cm–1. Experimentally determined extinction coefficients determined in triplicate for CMS-SH3d1 (76,973, 79,501, and 88,107 m–1 cm–1) are similar to the theoretical value. BIAcore Analysis—The experiments were carried out using a BIAcore 2000 at 25 and at 37 °C (15van der Merwe P.A. Bodian D.L. Daenke S. Linsley P. Davis S.J. J. Exp.

Chicken CAPZ mAbs 5B12.3 and 1E5.25.4 were obtained from Development Studies Hybridoma Bank (www.uiowa.edu/~dshbwww). Biotinylated peptide solutions were injected in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 400 ng/ml over immobilized streptavidin (3000–4000 RU). CMS, CIN85, and cCAPZ were directly immobilized by amine coupling in 10 mm NaAc buffer, pH 5.0. The response units immobilized are in the relevant figure legends. An extra washing step after blocking with ethanolamine was avoided to avoid possible inactivation of immobilized material. For affinity measurements, 5-μl injections of increasing and decreasing concentrations of monomeric SH3d1 proteins were passed over immobilized peptides at 20 μl/min at 37 °C, and the data were analyzed as described (15van der Merwe P.A. Bodian D.L. Daenke S. Linsley P. Davis S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 16Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J.

Antigen-specific T Cell Hybridoma assays—2B4 mouse T cell hybridoma and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing mouse I-Ek were used as model T and antigen presenting cells, respectively, as described (17Wild M.K. Cambiaggi A. Brown M.H. Davies E.A. Ohno H. Saito T. van der Merwe P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). CD2+ 2B4 T cell hybridoma cells were made by Anna Cambiaggi (Oxford, UK) using calcium phosphate transfection of the BOSC 293T packaging cell line, retroviral transduction, and selection using puromycin at 1 μg/ml. Several clones were pooled to produce a polyclonal population. PLEGFP-C1 constructs were introduced into the CD2+ and CD2– T cell hybridomas by retroviral transduction, with recombinant virus being produced by transfection using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) into the Phoenix packaging cell line. Antigen-specific IL-2 production and TCR down-modulation experiments were essentially as previously described (17Wild M.K. Cambiaggi A. Brown M.H. Davies E.A. Ohno H. Saito T. van der Merwe P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with the following differences. For both antigen stimulation and IL-2 production, round bottomed plates were used in the initial experiments (i.e. Fig. 6), and subsequently, flat bottomed plates were used. To measure IL-2 production, 8,000 HT2 cells (50 μl) were incubated with supernatants (50 μl: usually 1:1 and 1:5) for 16 h followed by a 6-h pulse with 0.8–1 μCi of [3H]thymidine. IL-2 production of triplicate or quadruplicate cultures was calculated using a standard of recombinant human IL-2 and curve fitting in PRISM. Down-modulation experiments were initially carried out in plates, with triplicate cultures being pooled into one fluorescence-activated cell sorter tube (Fig. 7B), but subsequently the whole assay was performed in fluorescence-activated cell sorter tubes (Fig. 7C). Optimal staining was obtained using a three-step staining procedure with KT3 (anti-mCD3), biotinylated anti-rat Ig (Jackson Labs), and Streptavidin-Quantum Red (Sigma). The stained cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and read the following day. The median fluorescence was determined from cells gated for the same levels of EGFP.Fig. 7Interactions of the N-terminal SH3 domain of CD2AP are important in regulating T cell signaling, and the mechanism involves TCR down-modulation. A, IL-2 production in response to antigen (30 nm moth cytochrome c) by cells expressing CD2AP-C, CD2AP-SH3D1-CC, and CMS-CC.

Four bands seen in analysis by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1) with peptide CD2:322–339 but not with other peptides including CD2:281–305 (data not shown) were identified (Table II). Band 2 represents CMS, the human homologue of CD2AP (11Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Band 1 is a closely related protein CIN85 (12Take H. Watanabe S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which has the same overall structure as CMS. Bands 3 and 4 contained the α and β subunits of the actin capping protein, CAPZ. CAPZα exists in two closely related isoforms (α1 and α2) that differ at the C termini (18Hart M.C. Korshunova Y.O. Cooper J.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1997; 38: 120-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Band 3 contained both CapZ α1 and α2 isoforms, because peptides unique to α1 and α2 were present (Table II). Peptide data from band 4 matched the human CAPZβ2 subunit (19Barron-Casella E.A. Torres M.A. Scherer S.W. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Casella J.F. J. Biol.

Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S. Desai N. Widder P. Rosenberger F. van der Merwe P.A. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The N-terminal SH3 domain of CD2AP mediated binding. Both this SH3 domain and the CD2:322–339 peptide have identical sequences in mice and humans. To confirm that CMS was binding directly to CD2:322–339 via its N-terminal SH3 domain and to ask whether CIN85 had comparable specificity, we tested binding of recombinant forms of CMS-SH3d1 and CIN85-SH3d1 (Fig. 2) to peptides using a BIAcore™. The N-terminal SH3 domains of CMS and CIN85 are the most similar, being 68% identical. Care was taken to conduct experiments with monomeric material within hours of elution from a gel filtration column. CMS-SH3d1 was injected over immobilized peptide, and the data are shown for five concentrations in Fig. 3A. CD2:281–305, which did not bind pMAL fusion proteins containing all three SH3 domains of CMS (not shown) or CIN85 (Figs. 2 and 4A, inset), was used as a negative control peptide. CMS-SH3d1 bound to CD2:322–339 and not to CD2:281–305 (Fig. 3A). CIN85-SH3d1 bound in a similar fashion (Fig. 3B) The signals for CMS-SH3d1 and CIN85-SH3d1 passing over the control CD2:281–305 are due simply to the high concentration of protein necessary for detection of weak interactions. Binding was characteristic of a low affinity monomeric interaction with rapid kinetics enabling a quantitative comparison between the two proteins to be made by calculating the KD from equilibrium binding values over a range of concentrations of soluble CMS or CIN85 SH3d1 (Fig. 3, C and D). Fitting binding data to a nonlinear hyperbole and Scatchard analysis (Fig. 3, C and D, insets) showed that CMS-SH3d1 and CIN85-SH3d1 bound CD2:322–339 according to a Langmuir model and with similar dissociation constants, 105 and 76 μm, i.e. in the order of 100 μm. Duplicate sets of data gave comparable results: CMS, 76 μm and CIN85, 72 μm. Slightly lower levels of immobilized peptide resulted in KD values of 129 and 127 μm for 127 and 76 and 77 μm for CIN85. We did not detect in our pull-down experiments another SH3 domain containing protein, CD2BP1, previously reported to interact with the region of CD2 covered by CD2:322–339 in either the absence or the presence of presence of 200 μm Zn2+ ions (7Li J. Nishizawa K. An W. Hussey R.E. Lialios F.E. Salgia R. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7320-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This may have been due to the sensitivity of the assay, and this putative interaction was tested using purified monomeric pMAL fusion protein containing the SH3 domain of CD2BP1, CD2BP1-SH3 (Fig. 2B, lane 4). An interaction was detected at 37 °C, but levels of binding were low despite the high levels of peptide immobilized, and the interaction showed less specificity than CMS or CIN85 because CD2BP1 bound to both CD2:322–339 and CD2:281–309 peptides (Fig. 3E). In experiments using immobilized peptide levels that gave clear CMS-SH3 binding at 4 μm, no binding was detectable with CD2BP1-SH3 at 40 μm even in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 (data not shown). CAPZ does not contain domains that are known to bind proline-rich sequences (21Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) and was not predicted to bind directly to the CD2 cytoplasmic tail. To distinguish between direct and indirect interactions, recombinant chicken CAPZ α1β1, which was available to us (cCAPZ; Fig. 2B, lane 9), CAPZ being highly conserved among species, was tested for interaction with CD2 peptides. Chicken CAPZ (46 μm) (Fig. 2) did not bind CD2 peptides (Fig. 3F) but was antigenically active because it bound mAbs specific for either chicken CAPZ α1 and β1 (Fig. 3F, inset). CAPZ Binds the C-terminal Region of CMS and CIN85 but Not the Coiled-coil Region of CMS—The lack of binding of CD2 peptides by cCAPZ was consistent with CAPZ being associated with the CD2 peptide via CMS and/or CIN85. The lack of proline-rich sequence in CAPZ suggested the mechanism of interaction between CAPZ and CIN85 or CMS would not involve the SH3 domains. This prediction was correct because CIN85-SH3d1–3 did not bind to immobilized cCAPZ (Fig. 4A), whereas CIN85-SH3d1–3 bound CD2:322–339 peptide (inset). A C-terminal fragment of CMS (CMS-C; Fig. 2, A and B, lane 6) was tested for interaction with immobilized cCAPZ. It bound avidly (Fig. 4B) to cCAPZ but not to CD2:322–339. This result with cCAPZ α1β1 heterodimer shows that the interaction is not CAPZ β isoform-specific because the human CAPZ (hCAPZ) identified in the pull-down experiments contained the α1β2 heterodimer. The avid binding is consistent with CMS-C being dimeric as shown by gel filtration (data not shown and Ref. 11Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). CMS-C also bound directly to human CAPZ α1β2 heterodimer (Figs. 4C and 2B, lane 8) and not to CD2:322–339. A motif (VEALK) within the coil-coil region of CMS known to selfassociate (11Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) is also present in the C terminus of human CAPZ β2, raising the possibility that this region mediated binding to CAPZ. However, the coiled-coil region of CMS, CMS-CC (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 5), which formed a tetramer as described for CIN85 (22Watanabe S. Take H. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrating a capability to form higher order complexes, did not bind to CAPZ (Fig. 4C, inset). CIN85-C (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 7) was also dimeric (data not shown) and bound immobilized hCAPZ with high avidity (Fig. 4D). In the reverse orientation, hCAPZ bound to immobilized CMS and CIN85, showing that binding was not an artifact of CAPZ immobilization (Fig. 4, E and F). Thus CAPZ interacts through a discrete fragment of the CMS/CIN85 C-terminal region, which is distinct from the upstream putative endophilin-binding sites (23Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and three of the four putative actin binding sites in the coiled-coil region at the C terminus of CMS (11Kirsch K.H.

https://openalex.org/W1965890551,"This study addresses the mechanism of covalent aggregation of human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (hSOD1WT) induced by bicarbonate (HCO3-)-mediated peroxidase activity. Higher molecular weight species (apparent dimers and trimers) of hSOD1WT were formed from incubation mixtures containing hSOD1WT, H2O2, and HCO3-. HCO3--dependent peroxidase activity and covalent aggregation of hSOD1WT were mimicked by UV photolysis of hSOD1-WT in the presence of a [Co(NH3)5CO3]+ complex that generates the carbonate radical anion (CO3.). Human SOD1WT has but one aromatic residue, a tryptophan residue (Trp-32) on the surface of the protein. Substitution of Trp-32 with phenylalanine produced a mutant (hSOD1W32F) that exhibits HCO3--dependent peroxidase activity similar to wild-type enzyme. However, unlike hSOD1WT, incubations containing hSOD1W32F,H2O2, and HCO3-did not result in covalent aggregation of SOD1. These findings indicate that Trp-32 is crucial for CO3.-induced covalent aggregation of hSOD1WT. Spin-trapping results revealed the formation of the Trp-32 radical from hSOD1WT, but not from hSOD1W32F. Spin traps also inhibited the covalent aggregation of hSOD1WT. Fluorescence experiments revealed that Trp-32 was further oxidized by CO3., forming kynurenine-type products in the presence of oxygen. Molecular oxygen was needed for HCO3-/H2O2-dependent aggregation of hSOD1WT, implicating a role for a Trp-32-dependent peroxidative reaction in the covalent aggregation of hSOD1WT. Taken together, these results indicate that Trp-32 oxidation is crucial for covalent aggregation of hSOD1. Implications of HCO3--dependent SOD1 peroxidase activity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease are discussed."

Mutations in the coding region of the MC4R are found more frequently in obese individuals, supporting the hypothesis that also in humans deficient melanocortin signaling may lead to obesity. Family studies that were carried out to demonstrate the relevance of single mutations for obesity were mostly inconclusive, most likely due to small sample size and complexity of the trait. In addition, the existing pharmacological data of the mutant receptors are limited in that for most mutations the effect on receptor expression level and Agouti-related protein (AgRP) pharmacology have not been studied. The aim of the present study was to gain further insight into the impact of the MC4R mutations on receptor function. Eleven missense mutations were tested for cell surface expression, affinity for α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and AgRP-(83–132), and the biological response to α-MSH. All mutants were poorly expressed at the cell surface, as measured by 125I-[Nle4-D-Phe7]α-MSH binding, and only a few mutants showed altered pharmacology for α-MSH and AgRP. Hemagglutinin-tagged mutant receptors were retained in the intracellular environment. These pharmacological data provide a basis to estimate the quantitative effect of MC4R mutations for the development of obesity.

Several lines of evidence have indicated involvement of the MC4R in the regulation of body weight in rodents. Ectopic overexpression of the MC1R/MC4R antagonist Agouti protein or the MC3R/MC4R antagonist Agouti-related protein (AgRP) in the brain results in obesity in mice (2Miller M.W. Duhl D.M. Vrieling H.

Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Berkemeier L.R. Gu W. Kesterson R.A. Boston B.A. Cone R.D. Smith F.J. Campfield L.A. Burn P. Lee F. Cell. 1997; 88: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar). An intermediate obese phenotype was found for heterozygous null mutants, suggesting a gene dosage effect. Whereas in normal mice application of melanocortin agonists decreased and (MC4R-selective) melanocortin antagonists increased food intake and body weight (7Fan W. Boston B.A. Kesterson R.A.

Palmiter R.D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Together, these data show that under normal conditions, MC4R activation serves to prevent overweight development, and disruption of this signal leads to obesity. In humans, the melanocortin system is also involved in body weight regulation. For instance, mutations causing defects in synthesis or processing of pro-opiomelanocortin, which encodes the melanocortin agonist α-MSH, lead to obesity (10Krude H. Biebermann H. Luck W. Horn R. Brabant G. Gruters A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Also, four frameshift mutations, one nonsense mutation, and 24 missense mutations have been found in the MC4R. Most of these mutations were only identified in obese individuals (11Yeo G.S.

Diabetologica. 2001; 44: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that mutations in the MC4R predispose for development of obesity. The incidence among obese individuals was estimated to be as high as 4%, which would make it the most common monogenic form of obesity (16Vaisse C. Clement K. Durand E. Hercberg S. Guy-Grand B. Froguel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). For several of the MC4R mutations, segregation of the mutant allele with obesity was investigated. For one frameshift mutation and one nonsense mutation, post hoc analysis yielded LOD scores of >3 (21Sina M. Hinney A. Ziegler A. Neupert T. Mayer H. Siegfried W. Blum W.F. Remschmidt H. Hebebrand J.

Although for the other mutants that were tested for segregation with obesity, most family members that carried these MC4R mutations were obese (14Gu W. Tu Z. Kleyn P.W. Kissebah A. Duprat L. Lee J. Chin W. Maruti S. Deng N. Fisher S.L. Franco L.S. Burn P. Yagaloff K.A. Nathan J. Heymsfield S. Albu J. Pi-Sunyer F.X. Allison D.B.

Invest. 2000; 106: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), causality is still ambiguous. Determination of penetrance was limited by small pedigrees and the complexity of the trait. For instance, some families may already be predisposed for obesity or leanness due to environmental and/or other genetic factors (21Sina M. Hinney A. Ziegler A. Neupert T. Mayer H. Siegfried W. Blum W.F. Remschmidt H. Hebebrand J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1501-1507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This could explain why phenotypes of carriers varied from no obesity to extreme obesity (15Farooqi I.S. Yeo G.S. Keogh J.M. Aminian S. Jebb S.A. Butler G. Cheetham T. O'Rahilly S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 16Vaisse C. Clement K. Durand E. Hercberg S. Guy-Grand B. Froguel P. J. Clin.

Pediatr. 2001; 139: 204-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), as is exemplified by the lack of cosegregation of a frameshift mutation that may be considered a loss of function mutation, with obesity (16Vaisse C. Clement K. Durand E. Hercberg S. Guy-Grand B. Froguel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Also, in one study, deletions in the chromosomal region that contains the MC4R were not associated with obesity (22Cody J.D. Reveles X.T. Hale D.E. Lehman D. Coon H. Leach R.J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 424-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although mutations in the MC4R predispose for development of obesity, not for every individual mutation is its role in the pathogenesis of obesity clear, and susceptibility to MC4R mutations may vary between individuals. Pharmacological evaluation of mutant receptors gives more insight into the impact of a mutation on receptor function at the molecular level and may be helpful to determine the quantitative effect of a mutation in mutation carriers. Since most of the mutations in the MC4R result in nonconservative amino acid changes, it seems likely that these mutations affect receptor function rather than that they are in complete linkage disequilibrium with disease mutations elsewhere in the gene. As outlined above, loss of function is expected from MC4R mutations that cause obesity. Indeed, several mutant MC4Rs only found in obese individuals were shown to have impaired or no functionality in vitro (14Gu W. Tu Z. Kleyn P.W. Kissebah A. Duprat L. Lee J. Chin W. Maruti S. Deng N. Fisher S.L. Franco L.S. Burn P. Yagaloff K.A. Nathan J. Heymsfield S. Albu J. Pi-Sunyer F.X. Allison D.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Farooqi I.S.

Hercberg S. Guy-Grand B. Froguel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), whereas mutations that had also been found in nonobese individuals did not affect receptor function (16Vaisse C. Clement K. Durand E. Hercberg S. Guy-Grand B. Froguel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 23Ho G. MacKenzie R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35816-35822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For most mutants that have been tested, however, only agonist binding and potency were determined. Since AgRP is an endogenous ligand for the MC4R, differences in its affinity can be expected to affect MC4R activity as well. In addition, for only two mutant receptors has the cell surface expression level been determined (14Gu W. Tu Z. Kleyn P.W. Kissebah A. Duprat L. Lee J. Chin W. Maruti S. Deng N. Fisher S.L. Franco L.S. Burn P. Yagaloff K.A. Nathan J. Heymsfield S. Albu J. Pi-Sunyer F.X. Allison D.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 23Ho G. MacKenzie R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35816-35822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), whereas this is often reduced as result of a mutation. Therefore, we extended the existing studies by assessing cell surface expression, affinity of AgRP and α-MSH, and the biological response to α-MSH for 11 of the MC4R mutations. Peptides and Chemicals—Forskolin was purchased from Sigma, and synthetic human AgRP-(83–132) was obtained from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Mountain view, CA). α-MSH and [Nle4,d-Phe7]α-MSH were purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Construction of Mutant Receptors—The human-MC4R cDNA (GenBank™ L08603) was used as a template. The receptor cDNA was cloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and maintained in the Escherichia coli DH5α strain. The mutations were introduced with a PCR strategy using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and Pfu buffer (Stratagene). Per reaction, two complementary primers that contained the mutations were used. The reactions yielded complete copies of both complementary strands of the plasmid, which readily can be transformed into bacteria. The primers used were as follows (per mutation, only the primer homologous to the coding strand is given from 5′- to 3′-end): S30F, CTGCACAGCAACGCGTCTGAGTTCCTTGGAAAAGGC; P78L, CTGCATTCACTCATGTACTTTTTCATATGCAGCTTGG; T112M, CTATTAAACAGTACTGATATGGATGCACAG; R165W, CCATAACATCATGACAGTTAAGTGGGTTGGGATC; R165Q, CCATAACATCATGACAGTTAAGCAGGTTGGGATC; I170V, GGTTGGGATCATCGTAAGTTGTATCTGGG, G252S, GCGATTACGTTGACCATCCTGATTAGCGTCTTTGTTGTCTGCTG; I317T, CTGAGGAAAACCTTTAAAGAGATCACCTGTTGCTATCCCCTGGG; I137T, CCTTGCTTGCATCCACCTGCAGCCTGCTTTCAATTGC; L250Q, CCTTGACCATCCAGATCGGCGTCTTTGTTGTCTGC; I301T, CAATCATCGATCCTCTGACTTATGCATTACGGAGTCAAG; V253I, GACCATCCTGATCGGCATCTTTGTTGTCTGC. Reaction mixtures (40-μl end volume) consisted of 20 ng of template DNA, 35 ng of DNA of each primer, 500 μm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), and 3 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) in the appropriate buffer concentration. The cycling parameters were 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 16 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 60 °C for 13 min, and at the end of the reaction an extension step at 68 °C for 20 min. Reaction samples were then cut with DpnI to fragment methylated template DNA and subsequently transformed into E. coli DH5α. The entire coding region of the receptor and upstream sequences of each construct were verified by sequence analysis. Construction of HA-tagged Receptors—The WT and three of the mutant receptors were N-terminally tagged with an HA tag using a PCR strategy. Sequences of the primers that were used are as follows (5′ to 3′): 1, CCATATGATGTTCCAGATTATGCTATGGTGAACTCCACCCACCG; 2, AGTCTCGAGACCTGCGTTAATATCTGCTAGACAAG; 3, ATCAGAATTCGGCCACCATGTATCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTATGC. Two consecutive PCRs were performed, the first using WT or mutant receptor DNA as template and primers 1 and 2. The second PCR used the product of the first PCR as template and primers 2 and 3. The reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 10 ng of template DNA, 30 ng/primer, 200 μm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), and 2 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The cycling parameters were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. These reactions insert an HA tag immediately upstream of the start codon of the MC4R gene, preceded by a consensus Kozak sequence and an EcoRI site. N-terminally, a BspMI and XhoI site are inserted after the stop codon of the MC4R gene. The PCR products were cloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using the EcoRI and XhoI sites and subsequently verified by sequence analysis. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Integro, Zaandam, The Netherlands), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). In order to avoid differences between cells not related to MC4r expression, transient expression of different receptors was performed in one batch of 293 cells for each experiment. Each experiment was performed at least three times. All transfections were done using standard calcium phosphate precipitation. For binding experiments and the adenylate cyclase assay, receptors were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells by transfecting cells growing in 10-cm dishes with 7 μg of DNA. For the reporter gene assay, cells growing in 10-cm dishes were co-transfected with 200 ng of receptor DNA and 7 μg of CRE-lacZ construct (24Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J.S. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The immunocyotochemical studies used BHK cells that were transfected with 1.4 μg of DNA/well of a six-well plate. To allow determination of transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with a lacZ construct. Two days later, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). By adding freshly prepared substrate solution (1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS), β-galactosidase-positive cells were stained. Binding Assay—IC50 values were determined with 125I-[Nle4-d-Phe7]α-MSH as tracer. [Nle4-d-Phe7]-α-MSH was iodinated using bovine lactoperoxidase (Calbiochem) and 125I-Na (ICN, Aurora, OH) according to Oosterom et al. (25Oosterom J. Nijenhuis W.A. Schaaper W.M. Slootstra J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16853-16860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and subsequently high pressure liquid chromatography-purified on a C18 column (μBondapak 3.9 × 300 mm; Waters, Milford, MA). 48 h after transfection, cells growing in 24-well plates were washed with Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 2.5 mm calcium chloride and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with peptides and tracer diluted in Ham's F-10 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.5 mm calcium chloride, 0.25% bovine serum albumin (ICN, Aurora, OH), and 200 KIU/ml aprotinin (Sigma). After two washes with ice-cold Trisbuffered saline (plus 2.5 mm calcium chloride) to remove nonbound tracer, the cells were then lysed in 1 m sodium hydroxide, and samples were counted in a γ-counter. Adenylyl Cyclase Assay—Adenylyl cyclase activity was determined using a modified method of Salomon (26Salomon Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide. Res. 1979; 10: 35-55PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 24-well plates and incubated for 2 h with 2 μCi/ml [3,8-3H]adenine (21.7 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in assay medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (ICN), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and nonessential amino acids. Subsequently, the cells were washed with assay medium containing 0.25 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma) and incubated for 20 min with compounds diluted in assay medium with 0.25 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. Then 1 ml of cold stop solution (5% trichloric acid (Merck), 1 mm cAMP (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm ATP (Roche Applied Science)) per well was added, and the plates were centrifuged at 250 × g. Finally, ATP and cAMP fractions were separated on Dowex (AG-50W-X4; Bio-Rad) and alumina (WN-3; Sigma) columns, respectively. ATP and cAMP fractions were dissolved in scintillation mixture (Ultima Gold™; Packard Instrument Co.) and counted in a β-counter. The equation [3H]cAMP/([3H]cAMP + [3H]ATP) was used to calculate adenylate cyclase (AC) activity as the percentage of [3H]ATP that is converted to [3H]cAMP. Reporter Gene Assay—In this assay, lacZ is used as a reporter gene (24Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J.S. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The cells were dispensed into 96-well plates (BectonDickinson) and 2 days later incubated with peptides at the appropriate concentrations in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (ICN) glutamine (Invitrogen) and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen)). After 5–6 h of incubation, the assay medium was aspirated, and 40 μl of lysis buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Roche Applied Science)) was added. The plates were stored at –20 °C, and after thawing, 80 μl of substrate mix (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.6 g/liter o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), 67.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Merck), and 1.5 mm magnesium chloride) was added. Absorbance at 405 nm was determined in a Victor2 microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemical experiments with HA-tagged receptors, BHK cells were used, since they attached better to glass coverslips as compared with HEK293 cells, which were washed away during the procedures. Cells growing on glass coverslips were transfected overnight with receptor DNA, and after 48 h they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and washed quickly two times in PBS. After incubation (30 min at room temperature) in TNB blocking buffer (provided with Tyramide Signal Amplification kit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-HA antibodies (Roche Applied Science) diluted in TNB buffer supplemented with 0.05% Triton TX-100. The samples were washed three times for 5 min with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The Tyramide Signal Amplification kit with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled streptavidin was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to stain positive cells. The coverslips containing the cells were mounted onto glass slides with 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)-octane/mowiol and viewed with a TCS NT confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). MC4R mutations were taken from four genetic studies, which had identified two silent mutations, one nonsense mutation, three frameshift mutations, and 20 missense mutations in the coding region of the MC4R gene (13Hinney A.

We selected 11 missense mutations that were only found in obese individuals, including five mutations that had not been tested pharmacologically before.

https://openalex.org/W1978417005,"The Giardia lamblia cyst wall (CW), which is required for survival outside the host and infection, is a primitive extracellular matrix. Because of the importance of the CW, we queried the Giardia Genome Project Database with the coding sequences of the only two known CW proteins, which are cysteine-rich and contain leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). We identified five new LRR-containing proteins, of which only one (CWP3) is up-regulated during encystation and incorporated into the cyst wall. Sequence comparison with CWP1 and -2 revealed conservation within the LRRs and the 44-amino-acid N-flanking region, although CWP3 is more divergent. Interestingly, all 14 cysteine residues of CWP3 are positionally conserved with CWP1 and -2. During encystation, C-terminal epitope-tagged CWP3 was transported to the wall of water-resistant cysts via the novel regulated secretory pathway in encystation-secretory vesicles (ESVs). Deletion analysis revealed that the four LRRs are each essential to target CWP3 to the ESVs and cyst wall. In a deletion of the most C-terminal region, fewer ESVs were stained in encysting cells, and there was no staining in cysts. In contrast, deletion of the 44 amino acids between the signal sequence and the LRRs or the region just C-terminal to the LRRs only decreased the number of cells with CWP3 targeting to ESVs and cyst wall by ∼50%. Our studies indicate that virtually every portion of the CWP3 protein is needed for efficient targeting to the regulated secretory pathway and incorporation into the cyst wall. Further, these data demonstrate the power of genomics in combination with rigorous functional analyses to verify annotation.

Further, these data demonstrate the power of genomics in combination with rigorous functional analyses to verify annotation. Giardiasis is a major cause of waterborne diarrheal disease (1Marshall M.M. Naumovitz D. Ortega Y. Sterling C.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 67-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Adam R.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 706-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Farthing M.J.G. Blaser M.J. Smith P.D. Ravdin J.I. Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1995: 1081-1105Google Scholar), contributing greatly to the global burden of malnutrition. Despite its importance, neither the basic biology of Giardia lamblia nor the pathophysiology of infection is well understood. Giardia infection initiates with ingestion of infectious cysts that can persist for months in cold fresh water (4Bingham A.K. Meyer E.A. Nature. 1979; 227: 301-302Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Exposure of cysts to gastric acid during passage through the stomach triggers excystation (4Bingham A.K. Meyer E.A. Nature. 1979; 227: 301-302Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Rice E.W. Schaefer F.W. III. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 14: 709-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and after entry into the small intestine, the parasite emerges and divides into two equivalent binucleate trophozoites (5Rice E.W. Schaefer F.W. III. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 14: 709-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Boucher S.-E. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trophozoites attach to and colonize the human small intestinal epithelium, where they can cause disease. However, if they detach and are carried downstream, they must encyst to survive outside the host. Our laboratory has reproduced the giardial life cycle in vitro (7Gillin F.D. Reiner D.S. Gault M.J. Douglas H. Das S. Wunderlich A. Sauch J.F. Science. 1987; 235: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Gillin F.D. Reiner D.S. Annu. Rev.

The “biological goal” of encystation is differentiation into a form that can survive in the environment and infect a new host. The construction of the extracellular cyst wall is therefore essential as it is the single structure that allows the parasite to persist in fresh water, resist disinfectants, pass through the stomach of the new host, and infect in the small intestine. This 300-nm-thick fibrous structure (10Erlandsen S.L. Bemrick W.J. Pawley J. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Erlandsen S.L. Bemrick W.J. Schupp D.E.

Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1996; 43: 416-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) is tight enough to exclude small molecules, such as water and gastric acid. On the other hand, it must be capable of transmitting the physiological stimuli that regulate activation and emergence (13Hetsko M.L. McCaffery J.M. Meng T-C. Que X. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 88: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, the encystation pathway may be thought of as a giardial virulence mechanism necessary for survival outside the host and infection. The cyst wall is at least 40% protein, and the remainder is carbohydrate (14Jarroll E.L. Macechko P.T. Steimle P.A. Bulik D. Karr C.D. van Keulen H. Paget T.A. Gerwig G. Kamerling J. Vliegenthart J.

The two known cyst wall proteins (CWPs) 1The abbreviations used are: CWP, CW protein; CW, cyst wall; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; ESV, encystation-secretory vesicle; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; nt, nucleotides; contig, group of overlapping clones. contain similar domains, including a putative N-terminal signal peptide and five tandem, leucine-rich repeats (LRR) (16Mowatt M.R.

Lujan H.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the regions of similarity, both proteins are acidic, but CWP2 has a very basic 121-residue C-terminal extension. Expression of the two CWPs increases greatly soon after exposure to encystation signals (16Mowatt M.R. Lujan H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol.

LRR motifs of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins have diverse functions and cellular localizations but are associated with protein-protein interactions (21Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8784-8788Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Kobe B. Deisenhofer J.

Earlier, we discovered a novel regulated secretory pathway that is induced during giardial encystation (19Reiner D.S. Douglas D. Gillin F.D. Infect.

The appearance of large membrane-bounded encystation secretory vesicles (ESVs) at 6–24 h is the earliest morphological change in giardial encystation (17Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 19Reiner D.S. Douglas D. Gillin F.D. Infect.

Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 72: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). CWP1 and -2 are concentrated within the ESVs for transport to the nascent cyst wall (16Mowatt M.R. Lujan H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol.

CWP1 and -2 also contain 18 and 19 cysteine residues, respectively, and form disulfide-bonded heterodimers and oligomers soon after synthesis (16Mowatt M.R. Lujan H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol.

However, the mechanism by which CWPs are targeted to the regulated secretory pathway is not well understood (28Hehl A.B. Marti M. Kohler P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Giardia belongs to one of the earliest diverging eukaryotic lineages (29Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). There is little understanding of the biology of the origins of eukaryotes, particularly of the endomembrane-mediated system of protein modification, sorting, and transport (30Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 2002; (Garland, NY): 551-651Google Scholar). The Giardia cyst wall is a relatively simple form of eukaryotic extracellular matrix with crucial structural and signaling functions whose assembly requires regulated protein expression and transport. Therefore, formation of the ESVs and cyst wall in this protist is an excellent model for the study of early forms of biosynthesis of extracellular structures in eukaryotes. Because of the evolutionary and functional importance of the cyst wall, we queried the Giardia Genome Project Database (www.mbl.edu/Giardia, Ref. 31McArthur A.G. Morrison H.G. Nixon J.E.J. Passamaneck N.Q.E. Kim U. Reich C.I. Holder M.E. Hinkle G. Crocker M.K. Farr R. Olsen G.E. Aley S.B. Adam R. Gillin F.D. Sogin M.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 271-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the coding sequences of CWP1 and CWP2 (16Mowatt M.R. Lujan H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) to identify additional CWPs. We identified five putative leucine-rich proteins. Only one of these (CWP3) is up-regulated during encystation and is transported by the ESV pathway and incorporated into the cyst wall. In contrast, the genes encoding the other four proteins are actually down-regulated during encystation. Therefore, we characterized the expression and detailed the targeting requirements of cwp3. Other important parasites, e.g. Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba, Toxoplasma, several tapeworms, and nematodes, are transmitted as cysts or oocysts with a resistant extracellular wall. Many of these parasites also emerge in the host small intestine after exposure to gastric and intestinal signals (32Despommier D.D. Karapelou J.W. Parasite Life Cycles. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Study of these organisms, however, is limited by the inability to generate viable cysts in vitro (9Eichinger D. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our completion of the life cycle of G. lamblia in vitro and the availability of the Genome Project Database make it a valuable model for other parasites whose differentiation has not been achieved. Giardia Culture and Encystation—Trophozoites of G. lamblia isolate WB (ATCC 50803), clone C6, were cultured in modified TYI-S33 medium (33Keister D.B. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1983; 77: 487-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Encystation was induced by a modification (34Sun C.H. Palm D. McArthur A.G. Svard S.G. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) of our earlier procedure (35Que X. Svard S.G. Meng T.C. Hetsko M.L. Aley S.B. Gillin F.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, trophozoites that were grown to late log phase in growth medium were harvested and encysted for the times indicated in TYI-S-33 medium containing 12.5 mg/ml bovine bile at pH 7.8 at a beginning density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Isolation and Analysis of the cwp3 Gene—We searched the G. lamblia Genome Project Database (www.mbl.edu/Giardia, Ref. 31McArthur A.G. Morrison H.G. Nixon J.E.J. Passamaneck N.Q.E. Kim U. Reich C.I. Holder M.E. Hinkle G. Crocker M.K. Farr R. Olsen G.E. Aley S.B. Adam R. Gillin F.D. Sogin M.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 271-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with amino acid sequences of the cwp1 and cwp2 genes (GenBank™ accession numbers S61925 and S61924, respectively), using the BLAST program (36Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59923) Google Scholar). We amplified a 1.2-kb sequence containing the cwp3 gene from genomic DNA by PCR using primers cwp35F (5′-CCAGTATCACGGAATTAATTTCTT-3′) and cwp33R (5′-TGTGACACGGGGAAAAGCCATAGG-3′). For RT-PCR, 5 μg of total RNA from vegetative and 24-h encysting cells was mixed with oligo(dT)12–18 and Superscript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR on the first-strand cDNA used primers cwp3F (5′-ATGTTTTCTCTGCTTCTTCTCCTT-3′) and cwp3R (5′-TTATCTGTAGTAGGGCGGCTGTAT-3′). Genomic and RT-PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced (Applied Biosystems). For semiquantitative RT-PCR of cwp3, total RNA from 24-h encysting cells was mixed with primer AU1 (5′-GATGTATCGATACGTATC-3′), and reverse transcriptase reaction was performed. PCR on the first-strand cDNA used primers cwp3F and cwp3R. For semiquantitative RT-PCR of neomycin, primer NEOR (5′-TCAGAAGAACTCGTCAAGAAGGCG-3′) was used for reverse transcriptase reaction. Primers NEOF (5′-ATGATTGAACAAGATGGATTGCAC-3′) and NEOR were used for PCR. Primer Extension and 3′-RACE Analysis—Primer extension was performed as described. Briefly, the labeled cwp5R primer (5′-TCCGACTGTAGCCAATTGTTTGGC-3′) (2 pmol) was added to RNA (50 μg), and hybridization was carried out by incubating the mixture at 80 °C for 3 min and then at 50 °C for 90 min. After addition of 100 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), the reaction mixtures were incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. 3′-RACE was performed using the 3′-RACE system (Invitrogen). For 3′-RACE, oligonucleotide cwp33RA (5′-GCACGATGCAACAGACTGCAATAC-3′) was used as amplification primer. RNA and DNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from G. lamblia at the indicated differentiation stages using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was isolated from trophozoites using DNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test). Standard procedures were used in electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization of genomic DNA and total RNA (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was fractionated and transferred to Zeta-Probe blotting membrane (Bio-Rad). Strand-specific probes were labeled using the Prime-It II kit (Stratagene). A full-length coding region probe of cwp3 was made with cwp3F and cwp3R and primed with cwp3R. The membranes were hybridized and washed as described (38Knodler L.A. Svard S.G. Silberman J.D. Davids B.J. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were imaged and quantified using a Storm system (Molecular Dynamics). Plasmid Construction—All cwp3 fragments were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR. The cwp3 gene and its 262-bp 5′-flanking region was amplified from genomic DNA with oligonucleotides cwp35NF (5′-GGCGGCTAGCCAGTATCACGGAATTAATTTCTTTGG-3′) and cwp3AUER (5′-GGCGGAATTCTTAGATGTATCGATACGTATCTCTGTAGTAGGGCGGCTGTATCTT-3′), digested with NheI/EcoRI, and ligated in place of the NheI/EcoRI-excised luciferase gene, 32-bp ran promoter, and two copies of a 19-bp tet operator sequence in pNLop2-1 (34Sun C.H. Palm D. McArthur A.G. Svard S.G. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pNC3, contained the cwp3 gene controlled by its own promoter with an AU1 tag fused at its C terminus. For constructing ND, a PCR with oligonucleotide cwp3NDF (5′-GGCGCCATGGATCAATATGATGCACTCGTTCAG-3′) and cwp3AUER generated a 0.7-kb product that was digested with NcoI and EcoRI. Another PCR with primers cwp3NDR (5′-GGCGCCATGGATCAGTAGTAACTTATTTTTTGGG-3′) and cwp35NF generated a 0.3-kb PCR product that was digested with NcoI and NheI and cloned into NheI/EcoRI-digested pNLop2-1 with the 0.7-kb NcoI/EcoRI fragment. The resulting ND contains a cwp3 gene lacking the predicted signal peptide sequence (residues 1–16). For constructing ND2, a PCR with oligonucleotide cwp3ND2F (5′-GGCGGGATCCTCACTAAATGTGCAGCACATGGGG-3′) and cwp3AUER generated a 0.6-kb product that was digested with BamHI and EcoRI. Another PCR with primers cwp3ND2R (5′-GGCGGGATCCGTCTACTAAACCATATCCAACCTC-3′) and cwp35NF generated a 0.4-kb PCR product that was digested with BamHI and NheI and cloned into NheI/EcoRI-digested pNLop2-1 with the 0.6-kb BamHI/EcoRI fragment. The resulting ND2 contains a cwp3 gene lacking the 44 amino acids N-terminal to LRRs (residues 17–60). A similar strategy was used to construct R1D, R2D, R3D, R4D, R1–4D, and CD1, which contain cwp3 gene with deletion of first LRR (residues 61–83), second LRR (residues 84–107), third LRR (residues 108–131), fourth LRR (residues 132–155), first to fourth (residues 61–155) LRRs, and the region C-terminal to LRRs (residues 156–201), respectively. The product obtained with primers cwp35NF and cwp3CD2R was digested with NheI and EcoRI and cloned into NheI/EcoRI-digested pNLop2-1. The resulting CD2 contains a cwp3 gene with a C-terminal (residues 202–247) deletion. The cwp2 gene and its 356-bp 5′-flanking region was amplified from genomic DNA with oligonucleotides cwp25XF (5′-GGCGTCTAGAAAACATGGGATGTGATCGATGTGACAC-3′) and cwp2AUER (5′-GGCGGAATTCTCAGATGTATCGATACGTATCCCTTCTGCGGACAATAGGCTT-3′), digested with XbaI/EcoRI, and ligated in place of the NheI/EcoRI-excised cwp3 gene in pNC3. The resulting plasmid, pNC2, contained the cwp2 gene controlled by its own promoter with an AU1 tag fused at its C terminus. The cwp1 gene and its 402-bp 5′-flanking region was amplified from genomic DNA with oligonucleotides cwp15NF (5′-GGCGGCTAGCTTCGCTTGCTTTTGCCGTTAGAAGAG-3′) and cwp1AU5ER (5′-GGCGGAATTCTCACTTGAGGTAGAAATCGGTAGGCGGGGTGAGGCAGTACTCTCCG-3′), digested with NheI/EcoRI, and ligated in place of the NheI/EcoRI-excised cwp1 gene in pNC1. The resulting plasmid, pNC1, contained the cwp1 gene controlled by its own promoter with an AU5 tag fused at its C terminus. A NheI/ClaI fragment containing the luciferase gene, 32-bp ran promoter, and two copies of a 19-bp tet operator sequence from pPop2 (34Sun C.H. Palm D. McArthur A.G. Svard S.G. Gillin F.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was replaced by the NheI/ClaI-excised cwp1 gene and its 5′-flanking region from pNC1, resulting in pPC1. The 262-bp 5′-flanking region of the genomic cwp3 gene was amplified with oligonucleotides cwp35NF and cwp35NR (5′-GGCGCCATGGATCAGTAGTAACTTATTTTTTGGG-3′), digested with NheI/NcoI, and ligated in place of the NheI/NcoI-excised 32-bp ran promoter and two copies of a 19-bp tet operator sequence in pNLop2-1. The resulting plasmid, pNC35, contained the luciferase gene under the control of the cwp3 promoter. The same strategy was used to clone pNC35+, which contains the 262-bp 5′-flanking region of the genomic cwp3 gene and includes 47 nt of the coding sequence upstream of the luciferase gene, using primers cwp35NF and cwp7NlucR (5′-GGCGCCATGGTCTACTAAACCATATCCAACCTCAA-3′). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were transfected with pNC3, ND, ND2, R1D, R2D, R3D, R4D, R1–4D, CD1, CD2, pNC2, pNC35, or pNC35+ and selected with G418 as described (39Sun C.H. Chou C.F. Tai J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were maintained at 150 μg/ml G418. Cells transfected with pPC1 were selected and maintained at 54 μg/ml puromycin (40Singer S.M. Yee J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with anti-AU1 or AU5 monoclonal antibody (Berkeley Antibody, 1/5000 in blocking buffer) and detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce, 1/5000). The control membrane was incubated with anti-gPDI-1 serum (38Knodler L.A. Svard S.G. Silberman J.D. Davids B.J. Gillin F.D. Mol.

Immunofluorescence Assay—Stably transfected cells were harvested after 24 h in growth or encystation medium under G418 selection, washed in PBS, and attached to glass coverslips (2 × 106 cells/coverslip) and then fixed and stained (41Abel E.S.

Water-resistant cysts were harvested after 48 h by centrifugation and five treatments with double distilled water for 5 min and then kept in cold distilled water overnight. Cells were reacted with anti-AU1 or AU5 monoclonal antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ, 1/300 in blocking buffer) and anti-mouse ALEXA 568 (Molecular Probes, 1/500 in blocking buffer) as the detector. The images were evaluated on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Encysting cells were processed as described (25McCaffery J.M. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 220-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed parasites were fixed in suspension for 15 min in freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde, in PBS, pH 7.4, and then pelleted and resuspended in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and fixed for an additional 18–24 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed briefly in PBS and resuspended in 1% low temperature gelling agarose. After cooling, the agarose blocks were trimmed into mm3 pieces; cryoprotected with 2.3 m sucrose/20% polyvinyl pyrrolidone (10 K), pH 7.4, for 2 h; and mounted onto cryopins and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were cut on a Leica UCT ultramicrotome equipped with an FC-S cryoattachment and collected onto formvar/carbon-coated nickel grids. Grids were washed through several drops of 1× PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum, 10 mm glycine, pH 7.4; blocked in 10% fetal calf serum for 30 min; and incubated overnight in 20 μg/ml anti-AU-1 antibody. After washing, the grids were incubated for 2 h in 5 nm AU-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). The grids were then washed through several drops of PBS followed by several drops of ddH2O and embedded in an aqueous solution containing 3.2% polyvinyl alcohol (10 K), 0.2% methyl cellulose (400 centiposes), and 0.1% uranyl acetate. The grids were observed and photographed on a Philips 420 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Sequence Analysis and Alignment—The cwp3 and lrp1–4 genes were amplified from genomic DNA. An alignment of the LRRs of Cwp1, Cwp2, and Cwp3 was prepared with ClustalW (42Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55757) Google Scholar). The cwp3 sequence was previously deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AY061927. The lrp3 sequence was previously deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AF310726. We have deposited lrp1, lrp2, and lrp4 in GenBank™ under accession numbers AY225413, AY225414, and AY225415. Identification and Characterization of the cwp3 Gene—To identify possible new cyst wall proteins, we queried the G. lamblia Genome Project Database (www.mbl.edu/Giardia, Ref. 31McArthur A.G.

This search detected five putative open reading frames with E values <10–4, lrp1, lrp2, lrp3, lrp4, and cwp3. During the course of this study, two of these proteins, LRP3 (“virus receptor protein”) and CWP3 were deposited in GenBank™ by others but not published. We found that lrp1, lrp2, lrp3, lrp4 were expressed at significantly lower levels during encystation (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we focused on cwp3, which was up-regulated (Fig. 1B). The cwp3 coding region with 262 nt of 5′- and 120 nt of 3′-flanking regions was retrieved and amplified. Comparing genomic and cDNA sequences showed that the cwp3 gene contained no introns. Primer extension analysis revealed a major transcription start site, –13, and three minor transcription start sites, –16, –17, and –18, relative to the translation start site of cwp3 in 24-h encysting cells. No primer extension product was detected in vegetative cells. All transcription start sites are located within a 9-bp AT-rich sequence, –13/-21 (AAAAAATAA), as has frequently been observed for initiation of giardial transcripts (16Mowatt M.R. Lujan H.D.

https://openalex.org/W2034506209,"EGR2 plays a key role in the PTEN-induced apoptotic pathway. Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to 39 cancer cell lines, we found that EGR2 could induce apoptosis in a large proportion of these lines by altering the permeability of mitochondrial membranes, releasing cytochrome c and activating caspase-3, -8, and -9. Analysis by cDNA microarray and subsequent functional studies revealed that EGR2 directly transactivates expression of BNIP3L and BAK. Our results helped to clarify the molecular mechanism of the apoptotic pathway induced by PTEN-EGR2, and suggested that EGR2 may be an excellent target molecule for gene therapy to treat a variety of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2011139344,"In yeast, MSH2 plays an important role in mismatch repair (MMR) and recombination, whereas the function of the mammalian MSH2 protein in recombinational repair is not completely established. We examined the cellular responses of MSH2-deficient mouse cells to X-rays to clarify the role of MSH2 in recombinational repair. Cell survival, checkpoint functions and relocalization of the recombination-related proteins MRE11 and RAD51 were analysed in embryonic fibroblasts derived from MSH2+/+ and MSH2−/− mice, and in MSH2-proficient and deficient mouse colorectal carcinoma cells. Loss of MSH2 function was found to be associated with reduction in cell survival following radiation, absence of either MRE11 or RAD51 relocalization and a higher level of X-ray-induced chromosomal damage specifically in G2-phase cells. Finally, MSH2−/− cells showed an inefficient early G2/M checkpoint, being arrested only transiently after irradiation before progressing into mitosis. Consistent with the premature release from the G2-phase arrest, activation of CHK1 was transient and CHK2 was not phosphorylated in synchronized MSH2-null cells. Our data suggest that an active MSH2 is required for a correct response to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, possibly connecting DSB repair to checkpoint signalling."

Here we show that in the cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), female subordinates help to raise new nestlings by providing them with food only when the offspring are being raised by parents who also fed the subordinates themselves when they were young3. These helper females use the continued presence of the primary female, rather than of the primary male, as their provisioning cue — presumably because female infidelity is rife in this species6, making their relatedness to the father less reliable."
https://openalex.org/W2017071958,"This fluid can be used to create remarkable magnetic levitation and patterning effects. In magnetic levitation, a strong and spatially varying magnetic field exerts an upward force on a body that is sufficient to counteract its weight due to gravity. Here we show that this effect can be enhanced by immersing the body in cold oxygen gas, which provides a further strong and adjustable buoyancy force that allows a wide range of materials to be levitated in an open, unpressurized vessel. The buoyancy of magnetized liquid oxygen is sufficient to float even gold and platinum, suggesting that this technique could find application in mineral separation. An interesting periodic pattern is created on the surface of this pure elemental paramagnetic fluid."
https://openalex.org/W1966078885,"A significant increase in the induction of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression and in the levels of nitrite plus nitrate was observed in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) stably transfected with catalase (RASMC-2C2) as compared with empty vector-transfected RASMC-V4 cells after exposure to cytokines and lipopolysaccharide. The increased expression of iNOS protein in the RASMC-2C2 cells was associated with a significant activation of nuclear transcription factor κB, one of the transcriptional regulators of iNOS expression. The induction of iNOS was also accompanied by increased protein tyrosine nitration in both cell types as revealed by immunocytochemical staining and high pressure liquid chromatography with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Nitrotyrosine formation was inhibited by 1400W, an iNOS inhibitor, by 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, and by the superoxide dismutase mimetic M40403, but not by the peroxidase inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic hydrazide. Electron microscopy using affinity-purified anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies revealed labeling at the cytosolic side of the rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes, in the nucleus, occasionally in mitochondria, and consistently within the fibrillar layer underneath the plasma membrane.

Moreover, the production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species could also result in the intracellular formation of nitrating species, which modify proteins by tyrosine nitration. Tyrosine nitration, the addition of a nitro (NO2) group in the ortho position of tyrosine residues, has been detected under physiological settings and in a number of pathological conditions including inflammatory and septic conditions (16Ischiropoulos H.

However, the mechanisms accounting for the intracellular nitration of proteins in non-inflammatory cells remain largely unexplored. In the present study, the mechanisms contributing to the formation of nitrated proteins within RASMCs in response to inflammatory stimuli are examined by using a combination of molecular, analytical, and pharmacological approaches. This cell model system was selected because stimulation with cytokines such as TNF-α or IL-1β results in the generation of reduced oxygen species, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (7Zafari A.M.

Expression of functional catalase in clonally expanded RASMC-2C2, but not RASMC-V4, was confirmed by Western blot analyses and catalase activity measurements of cell homogenates. For induction of iNOS, RASMCs (RASMC-2C2 and RASMC-V4 clones) cultured in 6-well plates were treated with a mixture of 250 units/ml TNF-α, 600 units/ml IL-1β, 300 units/ml IFN-γ, and 5 μg/ml LPS for 72 h in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 400 μm 1400W, 100 μm AEBSF, 5 μm M40403, 1 μg/ml, diphenylene iodonium, or 100 μm ABAH for 1 h before the addition of cytokines and LPS. After stimulation, cells were washed extensively with ice-cold PBS and processed for immunological or biochemical analyses. Detection of iNOS—Cells were lysed with 100 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 μm clasto-lactacystin β-lactone). The cells were scraped, and the soluble proteins were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatants were collected and stored at –80 °C. Extracted proteins were quantified by the Bradford assay using IgG as standard. Proteins (50 μg) were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 20 V overnight. Membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with PBS-containing 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 7.4). The blots were washed with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight with primary mouse monoclonal anti-iNOS or GAPDH antibodies at 1:2,000 and 1:40,000 dilution, respectively, in PBS containing 1% non-fat milk and 0.052 Tween 20 (pH 7.4). After washing with PBS-0.05% Tween 20, the gels were incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate at either a 1:2,500 (for iNOS) or 1:10,000 (for GAPDH) dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Measurement of Nitrite plus Nitrate—Cell culture medium was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Samples were diluted 3-fold with cold ethanol, vortexed, and left on ice for 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 0 °C, and 10 μl of the supernatant was injected in a reaction chamber containing a VCl3/HCl mixture heated at 95 °C in the chemiluminescence nitric oxide detector (Nitric Oxide Analyzer; Sievers Instruments, Boulder, CO). A standard curve was generated by injections of known concentrations of NaNO3. The levels of nitrite plus nitrate in the cell culture medium were normalized to protein concentration. Immunocytochemical Staining for iNOS and Nitrotyrosine—Cells were fixed with cold methanol for 20 min at –20 °C and with a mixture of cold acetone/methanol (1:1) for 5 min at –20 °C. Non-specific binding was blocked by incubation for 1 h with 10% bovine serum albumin and normal goat serum in PBS plus 0.3% Triton X-100 at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with an affinity-purified anti-nitrotyrosine polyclonal antibody (raised against nitrated KLH) (1:300) and anti-iNOS monoclonal antibody (1:500) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS plus 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and/or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody at 1:250 or 1:500, respectively, for 1 h. The anti-nitrotyrosine antibody specificity was confirmed by control experiments showing loss of antibody recognition following reduction of samples with 10 mm sodium dithionite or following competition with excess (10 mm) 3-nitrotyrosine. Fluorescent images were obtained using an Olympus 1X70 inverted microscope as described previously (35Paxinou E. Chen Q. Weisse M. Giasson B. Norris E.H. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8053-8061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assay for NF-κB Activity—Nuclei were extracted according to instructions included in the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif), and protein concentration in nuclear extracts was measured. DNA probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP by standard methods described in the gel shift assay systems (Promega). The labeled probe was separated from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP chromatographically on Chroma-Spin 10 spin columns. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using the consensus binding oligonucleotides (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ and 3′-TCAACTCCCCTGAAAGGGTCCG-5′) of NF-κB. DNA-protein binding reactions were performed with 5 μg of nuclear extract and 50,000–100,000 cpm of 32P-end-labeled double-stranded DNA probe in binding buffer composed of 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). All components of the binding reaction, with the exception of the labeled probe, were combined and incubated on ice for 10 min. After the labeled probe was added, the binding reaction was incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Competition experiment was performed with nearly a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides for NF-κB. Supershift assays were performed by the addition of 1.25 μg of antibody against the p65 component of NF-κB and incubated on ice for 30 min, before the probe was added. Samples were electrophoresed on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer at 75 V at 4 °C. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography at –80 °C using an image-intensifier screen. Quantification of 3-Nitrotyrosine—Control and stimulated cells were washed extensively with ice-cold PBS and harvested after application of trypsin in PBS. Cells were sonicated (three 5-s pulses at 8 W), and the content of protein 3-nitrotyrosine in lysates was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry using stable isotope dilution methodology and an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ Deca; ThermoFinigann, San Jose, CA) as described in detail previously (32Brennan M.L. Wu W. Fu X. Shen Z. Song W. Frost H. Vadseth C. Narine L. Lenkiewicz E. Bochers M.T. Lusis A.J. Lee J.J. Lee N.A. Abu-Soud H.M. Ischiropoulos H. Hazen S.L. J. Biol.

Nitrotyrosine contents of proteins are expressed as a product/precursor ratio (i.e. nitrotyrosine/tyrosine; μmol/mol). Immunoelectron Microscopy—Unstimulated cells (control) and cells treated for 72 h with cytokines plus LPS were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) for 2 h. After fixation, cells were scraped and collected, washed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and processed for immunoelectron microscopy as described previously (36Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 37Raposo G. Kleijmeer M.J. Posthuma G. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Herzenberg L.A. Weir D.M. Blackwell C. Weir's Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Malden, Malden, MA1997: 1-11Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed in PBS, dispersed in 12% gelatin at 37 °C, and centrifuged. The gelatin was allowed to harden at 4 °C, and the pellet was cut into small blocks, immersed overnight with 2.3 m sucrose, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transferred to a cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria). 50–60-nm-thick cryosections were thawed and immunolabeled with 20 μg/ml affinity-purified polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (NT432). The antibody was raised against a synthetic decapeptide (Cys-Gly-NO2Tyr-Gly-Gly-Gly-NO2Tyr-Gly) that was synthesized to include two nitrotyrosine residues. The antibody was affinity-purified using an affinity nitrotyrosine column (amino group of nitrotyrosine covalently linked to AminoLink matrix; Pierce), and the purity of the purified antibody was confirmed by SDS electrophoresis. The specificity of NT432 was determined by competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antibody binding at 1:3,200 dilution to nitrated proteins was competed by >90% only by 100 μm 3-nitrotyrosine, and not by 10 mm tyrosine, phosphotyrosine, l-Dopa, and 3-chlorotyrosine. The antibody labeling in the sections was visualized by protein A-gold. After labeling, the sections were stained with uranyl acetate and embedded in methyl cellulose before drying. Induction of iNOS—Immunostimulation of RASMCs with a cytokine mixture comprised of TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and LPS (“Experimental Procedures”) resulted in a time-dependent induction of iNOS. Data in Fig. 1A illustrate the time course of iNOS expression after stimulation. Expression of iNOS was near maximal 72 h after the addition of cytokines. There were no differences in the time course of cytokine-triggered iNOS induction of RASMCs stably transfected with either catalase (RASMC-2C2) or empty vector (RASMC-V4) (data not shown). Immunocytochemical studies showed expression of iNOS in the majority of cells and demonstrated intense staining for iNOS in 79 ± 2% of cells. All subsequent experiments were performed after 72 h of stimulation, unless otherwise stated. To examine the intracellular mechanisms of protein nitration in immunostimulated RASMCs, we used both molecular and pharmacological approaches. However, it is important to first document that the panel of specific i"

We report that β1 and β3 integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins on target cells and/or surfaces dramatically promotes CTL degranulation. CTLs, when adhered to fibronectin but not CTL in suspension, efficiently degranulate upon exposure to soluble MHC·peptide complexes, even monomeric ones. This adhesion induces recruitment and activation of the focal adhesion kinase Pyk2, the cytoskeleton linker paxillin, and the Src kinases Lck and Fyn in the contact site. The T cell receptor, by association with Pyk2, becomes part of this adhesion-induced activation cluster, which greatly increases its signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2133209345,"Yokonolide B (YkB; also known as A82548A), a spiroketal-macrolide, was isolated from Streptomyces diastatochromogenes B59 in a screen for inhibitors of β-glucoronidase expression under the control of an auxin-responsive promoter in Arabidopsis. YkB inhibits the expression of auxin-inducible genes as shown using native and synthetic auxin promoters as well as using expression profiling of 8,300 Arabidopsis gene probes but does not affect expression of an abscisic acid- and a gibberellin A3-inducible gene. The mechanism of action of YkB is to block AUX/IAA protein degradation; however, YkB is not a general proteasome inhibitor. YkB blocks auxin-dependent cell division and auxin-regulated epinastic growth mediated by auxin-binding protein 1. Gain of function mutants such as shy2-2, slr1, and axr2-1 encoding AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors and loss of function mutants encoding components of the ubiquitin-proteolytic pathway such as axr1-3 and tir1-1, which display increased AUX/IAAs protein stability, are less sensitive to YkB, although axr1 and tir1 mutants were sensitive to MG132, a general proteasome inhibitor, consistent with a site of action downstream of AXR1 and TIR. YkB-treated seedlings displayed similar phenotypes as dominant AUX/IAA mutants. Taken together, these results indicate that YkB acts to block AUX/IAA protein degradation upstream of AXR and TIR, links a shared element upstream of AUX/IAA protein stability to auxin-induced cell division/elongation and to auxin-binding protein 1, and provides a new tool to dissect auxin signal transduction.

Auxin controls cell division, elongation, and differentiation and therefore, through its action at the level of the cell, exerts profound effects on growth and development throughout the life of the plant (1Hobbie L. Timpte C. Estelle M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1499-1519Google Scholar). Consistent with the diverse effects of auxin on growth and development is that the expression patterns of a number of genes are dramatically and rapidly altered by auxin application (2Abel S. Theologis A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 9-17Google Scholar), suggesting that auxin ultimately regulates cell growth by controlling the profile of expressed genes. AUX/IAA genes comprise a 34-member gene family in Arabidopsis that is one of three known gene families that are regulated by auxin and implicated to play essential roles in auxin signaling (3Liscum E.

The molecular and genetic studies on auxin signaling have revealed that auxin specifically enhances the transcription of many AUX/IAA genes within minutes without requiring de novo protein synthesis, suggesting that AUX/IAA genes are primary auxin-response genes (5Abel S. Nguyen M.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 533-549Google Scholar, 6Oeller P.W. Theologis A. Plant J. 1995; 7: 37-48Google Scholar). AUX/IAA genes encode short lived nuclear proteins capable of heterodimerization with auxin-responsive factors (7Abel S. Oeller P.W. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 326-330Google Scholar) and are thought to act by negatively regulating the expression of early auxin-responsive genes including other members of the AUX/IAA family (3Liscum E. Reed J.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 387-400Google Scholar). Studies on Arabidopsis mutants with altered responses to auxin such as iaa3/shy2-2, iaa7/axr2-1, iaa17/axr3, iaa14/slr1, tir1, and axr1 revealed that the turnover rate of AUX/IAA proteins is in some way important in various developmental processes including lateral root growth, hypocotyl elongation, gravitropism, and photomorphogenesis (8Reed J.W. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 420-425Google Scholar, 9Gray W.M. Kepinski S. Rouse D. Leyser O. Estelle M. Nature. 2001; 414: 271-276Google Scholar). Dominant mutations in domain II of AUX/IAA as defined by iaa3/shy2-2, iaa7/axr2-1, iaa14/slr1, and iaa17/axr3 alleles confer resistance to ubiquitin-mediated degradation (10Ouellet F. Overvoorde P.J. Theologis A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 829-841Google Scholar, 11Kepinski S. Leyser O. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S81-S95Google Scholar). AXR1 is a subunit of the heterodimeric Nedd8/RUB1-activating enzyme that mediates the first step in the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like modification Nedd8/RUB1 to the cullin subunit of Skp1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) 1The abbreviations used are: SCF, Skp1/Cullin/F-box; ABA, abscisic acid; ABP1, auxin-binding protein 1; AhTet, anhydrotetracycline; 2,4-D, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; FC, fusicoccin; GA, gibberellin A3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GUS, β-glucuronidase; NAA, naphthalene-1-acetic acid; YkB, yokonolide B (A82548A); MS, Murashige-Skoog; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NPA, 1-naphthylphthalamic acid; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; MAPK, mitogenactivated protein kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase. 1The abbreviations used are: SCF, Skp1/Cullin/F-box; ABA, abscisic acid; ABP1, auxin-binding protein 1; AhTet, anhydrotetracycline; 2,4-D, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; FC, fusicoccin; GA, gibberellin A3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GUS, β-glucuronidase; NAA, naphthalene-1-acetic acid; YkB, yokonolide B (A82548A); MS, Murashige-Skoog; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NPA, 1-naphthylphthalamic acid; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; MAPK, mitogenactivated protein kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase.-type E3s (12del Pozo J.C.

A. 1999; 96: 15342-15347Google Scholar), and TIR1 encodes an F-box protein interacting with the Skp1 and Cdc53 (Cullin) proteins to form ubiquitin ligase complexes called SCFs (14Krek W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 36-42Google Scholar, 15Ruegger M. Dewey E. Gray W.M. Hobbie L. Turner J. Estelle M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 198-207Google Scholar). This SCFTIR complex mediates a proteolytic pathway responsible for the degradation of AUX/IAA repressors and ultimately impinges on gene expression including its own. Auxin increases the degradation rate of AUX/IAA proteins (16Zenser N. Ellsmore A. Leasure C. Callis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11795-11800Google Scholar) and promotes the interaction between AUX/IAA and TIR proteins (9Gray W.M. Kepinski S. Rouse D. Leyser O. Estelle M. Nature. 2001; 414: 271-276Google Scholar). However, probably due to gene redundancy and complex feedback control of AUX/IAA expression, loss of function of any specific AUX/IAA gene has little, if any, phenotype. The molecular mechanism by which auxin activates the expression of primary auxin-regulated genes and then elicits physiological responses is not fully understood. Therefore, the approach to this problem with loss of function for multiple AUX/IAA proteins will need to be accomplished either genetically or biochemically using specific inhibitors. There are a number of candidate signaling components residing between auxin perception and the action of the AUX/IAA proteins. For example, the MAPK cascade pathway may link auxin-responsive gene expression with apical signaling component(s) (17Kovtun Y. Chiu W.L. Zeng W. Sheen J. Nature. 1998; 395: 716-720Google Scholar), because MAPK kinase inhibitors inhibit the expression of a reporter gene driven by an auxin-responsive promoter (18Mockaitis K. Howell S.H. Plant J. 2000; 24: 785-796Google Scholar). Phospholipase A2 is rapidly activated by auxin and could act apically to gene expression (19Scherer G.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 357-372Google Scholar). Finally, auxin regulation of cell division involves a heterotrimeric G protein (20Ullah H. Chen J.G. Young J.C. Im K.H. Sussman M.R. Jones A.M. Science. 2001; 292: 2066-2069Google Scholar). Clearly auxin action is complex with multiple molecular pathways that probably interact via negative and positive feedback. One reason for our incomplete understanding of auxin action is the lack of bioprobes to dissect this complexity. Previously, we isolated yokonolide A and a known related compound, A82548A (designated here as yokonolide B (YkB)) (Fig. 1A), from Streptomyces diastatochromogenes B59 as inhibitors of auxin-responsive gene expression using a GUS reporter line under the control of an auxin-inducible promoter (21Hayashi K. Ogino K. Oono Y. Uchimiya H. Nozaki H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2001; 54: 573-581Google Scholar, 22Kirst H.A. Larsen S.H. Paschal J.W. Occolowitz J.L. Creemer L.C. Steiner J.L. Lobkovsky E. Clardy J. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 990-996Google Scholar). We report here the biological activities of YkB, demonstrate its specificity, and with it, connect the auxin signaling components to cell division and elongation. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—For all experiments, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia, Landsberg erecta, and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Petit Havana SR-1) seeds were used as controls. The available Arabidopsis mutants were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Transgenic Arabidopsis β-glucoronidase (GUS) reporter lines PIAA7::GUS, PIAA3::GUS, and ARR5::GUS and shy2-2 were provided by Drs. J. Reed and J. Kieber (University of North Carolina). The transgenic P-IAA 4/5 promoter (Δ-2309)::GUS and parA::GUS lines were provided by Drs. A. Theologis (United States Department of Agriculture, Albany, CA) and Y. Takahashi (University of Tokyo, Japan). The slr1 mutant was a gift from Dr. H. Fukaki (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan). Tobacco BY2 and Arabidopsis T-87 cells were obtained from the RIKEN plant cell bank (Japan). The HS::AXR3NT-GUS line was provided by Dr. M. Estelle (University of Indiana). Suspension-cultured tobacco cells (N. tabacum cv. BY-2) were maintained in a modified MS medium supplemented with 1 μm 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) as described in Ref. 23Winicur Z.M. Zhang G.F. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 501-513Google Scholar on a rotary shaker (100 rpm) at 25 °C in the dark. Auxin deprivation was carried out by washing a 7-day culture twice with the same medium lacking 2,4-D and then cultured in auxin-free medium for 24 h before auxin addition and determination of mitotic indices over time. Tobacco lines MJ10B carrying a tetracycline-inducible ABP1 transgene and the corresponding empty vector control line, R7, were described in Ref. 24Jones A.M. Im K.H. Savka M.A. Wu M.J. DeWitt N.G. Shillito R. Binns A.N. Science. 1998; 282: 1114-1117Google Scholar. Tobacco plants were grown in soil under continuous light at 23 °C. Chemicals—MG132 was purchased from The Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). YkB (A82548A), shown in Fig. 1A, was isolated from culture broth of S. diastatochromogenes B59 as previously described (21Hayashi K. Ogino K. Oono Y. Uchimiya H. Nozaki H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2001; 54: 573-581Google Scholar). Pure samples of YkB (<200 μg/researcher) are available for noncommercial research. The pUB23 plasmid used in the yeast assays was provided by Dr. D. Finley (Harvard Medical School). Hormone Induction—Seedlings (n = 10–15) were transferred to a 12- or 24-well microtiter plate containing 1 ml of germination medium (0.5× Murashige and Skoog salts (Invitrogen), 1% sucrose, 1× B5 vitamins, and 0.2 g/liter MES, pH 5.8) containing the indicated hormone and/or chemicals and then incubated for the indicated time to induce each responsive gene. For the P-IAA 4/5::GUS reporter line, we used the experimental methods previously described (25Ballas N. Wong L.M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 580-596Google Scholar). Histochemical GUS Staining and Quantitative Fluorometric GUS Assays—Whole seedlings (n = 10–20) or the roots were homogenized in an extraction buffer as described in Ref. 26Oono Y. Chen Q.G. Overvoorde P.J. Kohler C. Theologis A. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1649-1662Google Scholar. After centrifugation to remove cell debris, GUS activity was measured with 1 mm 4-methyl umbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide as a substrate at 37 °C. For the histochemical GUS assay, the seedlings were washed three times with buffer A (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 0.5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and then incubated in a staining buffer (buffer A containing 1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-glucuronide, the substrate for histochemical staining (X-gluc)) at 37 °C until sufficient staining developed. RT-PCR—mRNA was extracted from 100 mg of treated tissue using the QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The corresponding cDNAs were synthesized and amplified by the PCR using primers for the indicated genes as follows: IAA1, 5′-ggattacccggagcacaag and 5′-ggagctccgtccatactcac; IAA5, 5′-agatatcgtcgtctccggtg and 5′-gccgaagcaagatcttggta; SAUR-AC1, 5′-ttgaggagtttcttgggtgc and 5′-catggtattgttaagccgcc; RAB18, 5′-ttgggaggaatgcttcacc and 5′-ttgttcgaagcttaacggc; ACTIN (ACT2), 5′-aacattgtgctcagtggtgg and 5′-tcatcatactcggccttgg. The amplified products (IAA1, 208 bp after 27 cycles; IAA5, 251 bp after 25 cycles; SAUR-AC1, 220 bp after 27 cycles; RAB18, 269 bp after 27 cycles; ACT2, 206 bp after 25 cycles) were analyzed by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. Assays—Aleurone layers were prepared from de-embryonated barley seeds (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Kinuyutaka) as previously described (27Hayashi K. Inoguchi M. Kondo H. Nozaki H. Phytochemistry. 2000; 55: 1-9Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated aleurone layers were incubated in 5 mm CaCl2 solution containing 0 or 5 μm gibberellin A3 (GA) and the indicated concentrations of YkB at 25 °C with reciprocal shaking (80 rpm) for 24 h. Aleurone layers were homogenized in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.4, 20 mm CaCl2) and centrifuged. After centrifugation, the α-amylase activity was measured using RBB-starch (Remazol Brilliant Blue R-dyed starch, Sigma) as previously described (28Rinderknecht H. Wilding P. Haverback B.J. Experientia. 1967; 23: 805Google Scholar). BY2 tobacco cells were used for the auxin transport assay exactly as previously described (29Delbarre A. Muller P. Imhoff V. Guern J. Planta. 1996; 198: 532-541Google Scholar). Cells (0.5 g, fresh weight) were resuspended in transport buffer (29Delbarre A. Muller P. Imhoff V. Guern J. Planta. 1996; 198: 532-541Google Scholar) to a final density of 0.1 g/ml and aliquoted into 25-ml flasks containing [3H]NAA with or without 10 μm YkB and/or 10 μm 1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). Flasks were rotated (80 rpm), and for the indicated durations, aliquots of cells were collected by filtration and washed with water (5 ml). Fresh weight of cells was measured, and the radioactivity was counted on filters by liquid scintillation. Experiments were repeated twice. Seedlings (7 days old, n = 15) harboring the HS::AXR3NT-GUS transgene were heat-shocked at 37 °C in liquid germination medium containing 1.5% sucrose for 2 h. After 20 min at 23 °C, the indicated inhibitors and auxin were added to the medium. After the indicated times, degradation was stopped by immersing the seedlings into ice-cold 70% acetone for 20 s. Seedlings were immediately washed with distilled water and stored frozen prior to the GUS activity measurement described above. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The yeast ise1 deletion mutant (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hansen BY4742 mat alpha his3D1 leu2D0 lys2D0 ura3D0, ResGen, record number:10568), harboring a pUB23 plasmid encoding the galactose-inducible ubiquitin-β-galactosidase fusion protein, was cultured on uracil dropout medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% casamino acids, 20 μg/ml l-tryptophan, 20 μg/ml adenine) supplemented with 2% galactose until midlog phase. Cells were washed two times with uracil dropout medium supplemented with 2% glucose to stop further transcription of the fusion protein and resuspended in the same medium containing YkB or MG132 and cultured at 28 °C. Galactosidase activity was measured as previously described (30Guo Y. Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1400Google Scholar). ATP-dependent 20 S core unit activity of 26 S proteasome in Arabidopsis suspension T-87 cells was measured by peptide-hydrolysis using succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide as the substrate in the presence or absence of ATP and Mg2+, as previously described (31Fujinami K. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Cejka Z. Baumeister W. Miyawaki M. Sato T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25905-25910Google Scholar). Measurement of NAA-induced tobacco leaf curvature was as described in Ref. 32Chen J.G. Shimomura S. Sitbon F. Sandberg G. Jones A.M. Plant J. 2001; 28: 607-617Google Scholar with slight modification. The leaf strips were prepared from the sixth leaf of the seven-leaf staged transgenic tobacco MJ10B (tetracycline-inducible ABP1) or R7 (empty vector control) lines. One end of each strip was clamped by a small rubber block. Blocks of 12 interveinal leaf strips were placed in Petri dishes containing 5 ml of buffer (10 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm MES, pH 6.0) with or without the indicated concentrations of the test compounds. To induce ectopic expression of ABP1, MJ10B and R7 strips were incubated for 4 h in solution containing 4 μg/ml anhydrotetracycline (AhTet) prior to NAA and YkB addition. Photographs of the strips were taken, and the degree of curvature for each strip was measured with NIH Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For the root growth assay, surface-sterilized, stratified seeds were germinated on plates and then transferred onto new plates containing the indicated concentration of chemicals. Seedlings were cultivated vertically under continuous light condition at 23 °C. For dark-grown cultures, seeds were exposed to light for 8–12 h after stratification then treated as above except in darkness. For the hypocotyls growth assay, the surface-sterilized, stratified seeds were cultured in liquid medium with rotation (80 rpm) until germinated under continuous light or darkness for 2 days before the indicated concentrations of chemicals were added to the medium. Digital photographs of roots and hypocotyls were taken and analyzed by NIH Image software to measure the length of roots and hypocotyls. The lateral root promotion assay was carried out as described in Ref. 33Casimiro I. Marchant A. Bhalerao R.P. Beeckman T. Dhooge S. Swarup R. Graham N. Inze D. Sandberg G. Casero P.J. Bennett M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 843-852Google Scholar. The seedlings were vertically grown in light on the 1/2 MS plate (1% sucrose) containing 0.5 μm NPA for 9 days to inhibit auxin transport. The seedlings were transferred to 1/2 MS plates containing YkB with or without 0.1 μm NAA. Lateral roots were counted after an additional 4 days of vertical cultivation in light. Gene Expression Profiling—Etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings (4 days old), cultured in 1/2 MS liquid medium containing 1% sucrose, were treated with the indicated concentration of compounds for 20 min in the dark. The seedlings were then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was isolated per the manufacturer's instructions (Plant RNAeasy kit; Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). In order to average out variability but to minimize the number of chips needed, treatments were done in triplicate, and frozen seedlings were pooled followed by three RNA isolations, which were then pooled after a quality control check of the RNA. The raw intensity data of each condition obtained from imaging the hybridized microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were normalized using the global normalization method and further analyzed by MAExplorer freeware developed by the National Cancer Institute. The obtained profiles of regulated genes were evaluated individually with Student's t test. All profiles were statistically significant (p < 0.01). YkB Blocks Primary Auxin-responsive Gene Expression— BA::GUS plants contain an auxin-inducible promoter composed of two auxin-responsive elements derived from the pea AUX/IAA promoter, P-IAA 4/5 (26Oono Y. Chen Q.G. Overvoorde P.J. Kohler C. Theologis A. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1649-1662Google Scholar). YkB (5 μm) completely inhibited IAA-induced GUS reporter gene expression in the BA::GUS line (Fig. 1, B and D). The activity of the synthetic DR5 promoter, which is composed of tandem elements taken from the primary auxin-responsive GH3 promoter (34Ulmasov T. Murfett J. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1963-1971Google Scholar), was also inhibited by 5 μm YkB (Fig. 1, B and E). In addition to synthetic promoters, YkB also inhibited GUS driven by the native auxin-inducible promoters, PIAA3::GUS, PIAA7::GUS, and pea P-IAA 4/5::GUS (Fig. 1, B and C) in roots and hypocotyls (25Ballas N. Wong L.M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 580-596Google Scholar, 35Tian Q. Uhlir N.J. Reed J.W. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 301-319Google Scholar). YkB does not alter GUS activity in vitro (data not shown) and does not compete with auxin at an auxin-binding site because YkB inhibition was independent of auxin concentration (Fig. 1D). The effects of YkB on the steady-state levels of primary auxin-responsive AUX/IAAs (IAA1, IAA5) and SAUR-AC1 (36Gil P. Liu Y. Orbovic V. Verkamp E. Poff K.L. Green P.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 777-784Google Scholar) messages were directly confirmed using RTPCR (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that YkB is an effective inhibitor of expression of auxin-responsive genes. Two lines of evidence indicate that YkB does not act by altering the level of auxin in cells. Auxin influx carriers transport IAA and 2,4-D into the cell, whereas NAA entry is unfacilitated. In contrast, auxin efflux carriers transport IAA and NAA from the cell, but the movement of 2,4-D is unfacilitated; thus, any difference in the activity profiles of these three auxins is diagnostic for a role in auxin transport (29Delbarre A. Muller P. Imhoff V. Guern J. Planta. 1996; 198: 532-541Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1F, YkB was equally effective at blocking auxin-induced gene expression by these three auxins, suggesting that YkB does not alter auxin influx. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1G, YkB had no effect on [3H]NAA efflux through BY2 cells as measured directly in standard accumulation experiments. In addition, YkB showed no effects on 2,4-D influx in BY2 cells, indicating that YkB does not alter auxin uptake (data not shown). To assess whether this inhibitory activity is specific to primary auxin-responsive genes, the effects of YkB were assayed using the Arabidopsis cytokinin-inducible ARR5 reporter line (37D'Agostino I.B. Deruere J. Kieber J.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1706-1717Google Scholar), Arabidopsis ABA-inducible gene (RAB18) transcription (38Lang V. Palva E.T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 951-962Google Scholar), and barley GA-inducible α-amylase expression (Fig. 2, A and B). YkB had no effect on ABA-inducible RAB18 gene expression or GA-inducible α-amylase expression. At relatively high concentrations of YkB, cytokinin-induced GUS expression in the ARR5::GUS line was partially reduced (data not shown). YkB Inhibits Degradation of an AUX/IAA Repressor, but Not 26 S Proteasome Activity—Because auxin alters the stability of AUX/IAA repressors, which in turn could explain the results on reporter gene expression above, we measured the effect of YkB on auxin-induced degradation of an AUX/IAA protein in vivo (9Gray W.M. Kepinski S. Rouse D. Leyser O. Estelle M. Nature. 2001; 414: 271-276Google Scholar, 11Kepinski S. Leyser O. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S81-S95Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis HS::AXR3NT-GUS transgenic line strongly expresses an AUX/IAA-GUS (IAA17/AXR3-GUS) translational fusion protein under the heat shock promoter (9Gray W.M. Kepinski S. Rouse D. Leyser O. Estelle M. Nature. 2001; 414: 271-276Google Scholar). The degradation rate of the AUX/IAA fusion protein is rapid and is enhanced by auxin, but it is inhibited by the 20 S core protease inhibitor, MG132. Both MG132 and YkB inhibited degradation of the fusion protein even in the presence of auxin (Fig. 3, A and B). This inhibitory activity of YkB on AUX/IAAGUS degradation suggests that the inhibition of primary auxin-responsive gene expression is achieved by AUX/IAA repressor stabilization. The effect of MG132 on auxin-responsive reporter gene induction confirmed this regulatory model (Fig. 1B). To test the possibility that YkB is a general proteasome inhibitor, we examined the effects of YkB on ATP-dependent proteasome activity using Arabidopsis T-87 cells and an S. cerevisiae ise1 (erg6) strain expressing ubiquitin-β-galactosidase fusion protein as proteasome substrate under the control of the GAL4 promoter (39Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Google Scholar, 40Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Google Scholar). The ise1 yeast strain was chosen to preclude detoxification of the drug by pumping via multidrug resistance channels (41Kaur R. Bachhawat A.K. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 809-818Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, β-galactosidase activity was decreased within 3 h in the untreated ise1 yeast cells. MG132 prevented the β-galactosidase fusion protein from degradation indicated by unchanged β-galactosidase activity over time. In contrast, YkB had no effect on the rate of degradation of the fusion protein, illustrating that, at a concentration that is supraoptimal to inhibit AUX/IAA degradation in plants, YkB does not alter proteasome activity in yeast. Moreover, MG132 and YkB did not affect the growth rate of yeast, suggesting that the distinct effect between MG132 and YkB on the degradation of the β-galactosidase fusion protein was not due to the effect on yeast growth (Fig. 3C). The 20 S core unit proteolytic activity of the 26 S proteasome in Arabidopsis T-87 cells was directly measured with a fluorogenic peptide substrate. As shown in Fig. 3D, YkB did not inhibit plant proteasome activity in contrast to complete inhibition by MG132. Furthermore, YkB (100 μm) did not inhibit GA-induced barley α-amylase expression, which is known to be repressed by MG132, since it requires the degradation of SLN1 repressor via the ubiquitin-proteolytic pathway (42Fu X. Richards D.E. Ait-Ali T. Hynes L.W. Ougham H. Peng J. Harberd N.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3191-3200Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of primary auxin-responsive genes by YkB is due to AUX/IAA stabilization but not general proteasome inhibition and that this site of action of YkB is specific to auxin. YkB Blocks Auxin-regulated Gene Expression Globally—The effect of auxin and YkB on gene expression was performed with the hybridized microarray using an 8,300-gene probe set. Several interesting patterns were identified supporting the conclusion that YkB, in concert with auxin, regulates the expression of many genes including primary auxin-responsive genes. Four-day-old, etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with or without auxin in the presence or absence of YkB for 20 min. Approximately 4,500 gene sets hybridized detectable cRNA in all five conditions as indicated in Fig. 4A and were used for further expression analysis. Representative clustered genes among the 74 up-regulated and 113 down-regulated gene sets are shown (the entire sets are provided in supplemental data). Gene profiling used strict p value and change criteria as well as triplicates to assure that the differences are statistically significant. Four major types of expression profiles (designated a–d) were clustered into up-regulated gene sets (Fig. 4A). The classes of up-regulated genes (profiles a, b, and c) included ACS (ethylene biosynthesis gene), defense/stress-related proteins, and transcription factors. Type a profiled genes required both auxin and YkB for up-regulation, and the genes in type b are up-regulated by auxin, which is further enhanced by YkB. Consistent with the results obtained through reporter lines and direct measurement of mRNA steady-state levels, half of the IAA up-regulated genes were inhibited by YkB (profile c). Profile c comprised AUX/IAA, SAUR, GH3, and ACS genes. However, no SAUR, GH3, AUX/IAA, or ACS genes were up-regulated by YkB alone. Four expression profiles (H–K) define the down-regulated genes.

https://openalex.org/W2115246644,"Natronobacterium pharaonis phoborhodopsin (ppR; also called N. pharaonis sensory rhodopsin II, NpsRII) is a photophobic sensor in N. pharaonis, and has a shorter absorption maximum (λmax, 500 nm) than those of other archaeal retinal proteins (λmax, 560–590 nm) such as bacteriorhodopsin (bR). We constructed chimeric proteins between bR and ppR to investigate the long range interactions effecting the color regulation among archaeal retinal proteins. The λmax of B-DEFG/P-ABC was 545 nm, similar to that of bR expressed in Escherichia coli (λmax, 550 nm). B-DEFG/P-ABC means a chimera composed of helices D, E, F, and G of bR and helices A, B, and C of ppR. This indicates that the major factor(s) determining the difference in λmax between bR and ppR exist in helices DEFG. To specify the more minute regions for the color determination between bR and ppR, we constructed 15 chimeric proteins containing helices D, E, F, and G of bR. According to the absorption spectra of the various chimeric proteins, the interaction between helices D and E as well as the effect of the hydroxyl group around protonated Schiff base on helix G (Thr-204 for ppR and Ala-215 for bR) are the main factors for spectral tuning between bR and ppR. Natronobacterium pharaonis phoborhodopsin (ppR; also called N. pharaonis sensory rhodopsin II, NpsRII) is a photophobic sensor in N. pharaonis, and has a shorter absorption maximum (λmax, 500 nm) than those of other archaeal retinal proteins (λmax, 560–590 nm) such as bacteriorhodopsin (bR). We constructed chimeric proteins between bR and ppR to investigate the long range interactions effecting the color regulation among archaeal retinal proteins. The λmax of B-DEFG/P-ABC was 545 nm, similar to that of bR expressed in Escherichia coli (λmax, 550 nm). B-DEFG/P-ABC means a chimera composed of helices D, E, F, and G of bR and helices A, B, and C of ppR.

Photoreceptors having retinal (vitamin A aldehyde) as a choromophore are found in various organisms as evolutionary distant as archaea, algae, mammals, etc. (1Spudich J.L. Yang C.S. Jung K.H. Spudich E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 365-392Google Scholar). These retinal proteins react to light of a specific wavelength. These proteins all share the same basic structure. The proteins fold into seven helical segments (2Yokoyama S. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 2000; 19: 385-419Google Scholar, 3Ihara K. Umemura T. Katagiri I. Kitajima-Ihara T. Sugiyama Y. Kimura Y.

They are covalently bound to an 11-cis (mammal type) or all-trans (archaeal type) retinal chromophore at a conserved lysine residue on the G helix via a protonated Schiff base (PSB) 1The abbreviations used are: PSB, protonated Schiff base; bR, bacteriorhodopsin; hR, halorhodopsin; sR, sensory rhodopsin; pR, phoborhodopsin; ppR, N. pharaonis pR; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; λmax, absorption maximum; PC, l-α-phosphatidylcholine; FT, Fourier transform; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: PSB, protonated Schiff base; bR, bacteriorhodopsin; hR, halorhodopsin; sR, sensory rhodopsin; pR, phoborhodopsin; ppR, N. pharaonis pR; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; λmax, absorption maximum; PC, l-α-phosphatidylcholine; FT, Fourier transform; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid. bond. The absorption maximum (λmax) of the chromophore corresponds to its most probable transition from ground to excited state. Accordingly, any factors changing the energy gap between the ground and excited states lead to a change in λmax. Empirical and theoretical studies have suggested several mechanisms by which the spectral tuning between a protein and organic solvent occurs. They include the following: (i) the strength of the electrostatic interaction between PSB and its counter ion or hydrogen bond acceptor (4Blatz P.E. Mohler J.H. Navangul H.V. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 848-855Google Scholar, 5Hu J. Griffin R.G. Herzfeld J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8880-8884Google Scholar, 6Rajamani R. Gao J. J. Comput.

Biol. 2001; 11: 415-419Google Scholar, 11Neutze R. Pebay-Peyroula E. Edman K. Royant A. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 144-167Google Scholar), halorhodopsin (hR) (12Essen L.O. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 516-522Google Scholar), sensory rhodopsin (sR or sRI) (13Hoff W.D. Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 223-258Google Scholar), and phoborhodopsin (pR or sRII) (14Tomioka H. Takahashi T. Kamo N. Kobatake Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 389-395Google Scholar, 15Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 230-239Google Scholar). For the λmax values, pR is remarkably different from the other three; bR, hR, and sR have their λmax at 560–590 nm, whereas that of pR is blue-shifted to ∼500 nm (16Takahashi T. Yan B. Mazur P. Derguini F. Nakanishi K. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8467-8474Google Scholar). The blue-shifted λmax of pR is, therefore, very interesting, and its origin is worthy of investigation. What is the molecular mechanism for the λmax of pR being shifted, although all archaeal retinal proteins are quite similar in their primary structure, especially in the chromophore-binding site?Phoborhodopsin from a haloalkaliphilic bacterium, Natronobacterium pharaonis (N. pharonis phoborhodopsin, ppR; also called N. pharaonis sensory rhodopsin II, NpsRII) is very similar to the pR from H. salinarum in spectroscopic properties and physiological functions (17Kamo N. Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sudo Y. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 66: 1277-1282Google Scholar). We succeeded in expressing ppR in a photoactive form in the Escherichia coli membrane (18Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sumi M. Kamo N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 54-56Google Scholar). With use of this expression system, until now, the characteristics of ppR have been reported by various measurements (17Kamo N. Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sudo Y. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 66: 1277-1282Google Scholar, 19Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Google Scholar, 20Arakawa T. Shimono K. Yamaguchi S. Tuzi S. Sudo Y. Kamo N. Saito H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 237-240Google Scholar, 21Spudich J.L. Luecke H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 540-546Google Scholar, 22Spudich J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 797-799Google Scholar, 23Pebay-Peyroula E. Royant A. Landau E.M. Navarro J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 196-205Google Scholar, 24Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Buldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Google Scholar). We reported the effect of the replacement of three characteristic amino acid residues of ppR (Val-108, Gly-130, and Thr-204) on λmax. These are completely conserved among the bR, hR, and sR groups (whose λmax is 560–590 nm) but are replaced by other residues in the pR groups (whose λmax is 500 nm). Even for a triple mutant (V108M/G130S/T204A), λmax was 515 nm (25Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sumi M. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 141-145Google Scholar). This result implied that there might be other amino acid residues determining the color regulation because it is quite conceivable that the change in the environment around the chromophore is one of the most influential factors regulating color. In fact, Sakmar and co-workers (26Lin S.W. Kochendoerfer G.G. Carroll K.S. Wang D. Mathies R.A. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24583-24591Google Scholar, 27Kochendoerfer G.G. Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Mathies R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 300-305Google Scholar) succeeded in producing a significant blue shift for rhodopsin (500 nm) to 438 nm by simultaneous substitution of nine sites around the chromophore of rhodopsin, whose shift amounts to 80% of the spectral tuning between rhodopsin and the blue cone pigment. Therefore, it is considered that the λmax among archaeal rhodopsins is also determined by the difference in the environment around the chromophore. Recently, the crystallographic structure of ppR was reported from two groups (28Luecke H. Schobert B. Lanyi J.K. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1499-1503Google Scholar, 29Royant A. Nollert P. Edman K. Neutze R. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Navarro J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10131-10136Google Scholar). The structure within 5 Å from the conjugated polyene chain of the chromophore or any methyl group of the polyene chain in the chromophore in ppR is similar to that in bR, and the structure of the chromophore itself in ppR is almost the same as that in bR. However, the hydrogen bond of PSB in ppR is stronger than that in bR based on Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (19Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently reported that the spectral red shift in a multiple mutant of ppR having the same retinal-binding site residues of bR was less than 40% (λmax, 524 nm), and from an FT-IR study, that the hydrogen bond of PSB in this multiple mutant remained strong (30Shimono K. Ikeura Y. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Kamo N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1515: 92-100Google Scholar, 31Shimono K. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6504-6509Google Scholar). These facts may indicate that the environment around PSB in ppR slightly differs from that in bR, and there exist some long range interactions determining the structural features around PSB. According to two crystallographic structures (28Luecke H. Schobert B. Lanyi J.K. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1499-1503Google Scholar, 29Royant A. Nollert P. Edman K. Neutze R. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Navarro J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10131-10136Google Scholar), a difference related to determining the structural features around PSB appears: its difference is the reposition of the guanidinium group of Arg-72, which interacts with the counter ion (Asp-75) against the PSB. In fact, Luecke et al. (28Luecke H. Schobert B. Lanyi J.K. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1499-1503Google Scholar) proposed specifically that the repositioning of Arg-72 is responsible for the spectral difference. Based on the x-ray structure, Ren et al. (32Ren L. Martin C.H. Wise K.J. Gillespie N.B. Luecke H. Lanyi J.K. Spudich J.L. Birge R.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13906-13914Google Scholar) and Hayashi et al. (33Hayashi S. Tajkhorshid E. Pebay-Peyroula E. Royant A. Landau E.M. Navarro J. Schulten K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 10124-10131Google Scholar) predicted the mechanism of spectral tuning between bR and ppR using a quantum mechanical calculation and suggested the existence of a long range interaction. However, their studies come to different conclusions about the principal mechanism of spectral tuning. Ren et al. (32Ren L. Martin C.H. Wise K.J. Gillespie N.B. Luecke H. Lanyi J.K. Spudich J.L. Birge R.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13906-13914Google Scholar) concluded that the major source of the blue shift is associated with the significantly different orientation of the guanidinium of Arg-72 in ppR (Arg-82 in bR) in the two proteins. Hayashi et al. (33Hayashi S. Tajkhorshid E. Pebay-Peyroula E. Royant A. Landau E.M. Navarro J. Schulten K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 10124-10131Google Scholar) concluded that the spectral shift is predominantly induced by a shift of the G helix in the calculated structure that renders the distance between the PSB and the Asp-201 shorter in ppR than in bR.To investigate the long range interactions, constructing the chimeric proteins among a family is promising. Shi et al. (34Shi Y. Randlwimmer F.B. Yokoyama S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11731-11736Google Scholar) constructed chimeric proteins between human blue and mouse ultraviolet pigments and reported that the transmembrane helices A, B, and C were important to the spectral shift, and individual sites contributing the color regulation were assigned. In the present study, we constructed various chimeric proteins between bR and ppR to investigate the long range interactions and the effect of the helix-helix interaction on spectral tuning between bR and ppR and to discuss in which transmembrane helices the color-determining factors exist.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Expression Plasmids—The ppR opsin-fusing histidine tag clones have been subcloned into an expression vector, pET21c (Novagen, Madison, WI) (19Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Google Scholar). The plasmid, including a full-length bop with a fusing histidine tag, was prepared by a PCR using genomic DNA from the H. salinarum strain R1 prepared as described in Ref. 35Charlebois R.L. Hofman J.D. Schalkwyk L.C. Lam W.L. Doolittle W.F. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 21-29Google Scholar. PCR was carried out using two oligonucleotide primers introducing a 5′-NdeI (sense primer) and 3′-XhoI (antisense primer) restriction site (18Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sumi M. Kamo N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 54-56Google Scholar, 19Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Google Scholar). The stop codon was deleted during amplification. A PCR product containing the bop gene was obtained, purified, and subcloned into the plasmid vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The construction of the expression plasmid, pET/bRHis, is essentially the same as that described in Ref. 19Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Google Scholar. We have constructed a series of chimeras between the bR and ppR opsins by introducing appropriate restriction enzyme sites; EcoT14I (for separate helices B and C), EcoRI (helices C and D), SmaI (helices D and E), NheI (helices E and F), NdeI (helices F and G) (Fig. 1). The B-DEFG/P-ABC and B-ABC/P-DEFG chimeric genes were, for example, constructed by ligating two fragments (bR gene and ppR gene) restricted by NdeI and EcoRI. Therefore, the amino acid sequence of B-DEFG/P-ABC is... DSRppREFbRLAL... (Fig. 1), and EF is a linker site. Mutations for introducing the restriction enzyme sites were generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). DNA sequencing was carried out using a DNA Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All constructed plasmids were analyzed using an automated sequencer (377 DNA sequencer, Applied Biosystems).Sample Preparation—All pigments were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (18Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sumi M. Kamo N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 54-56Google Scholar). Preparation of the crude membranes was described previously (18Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sumi M. Kamo N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 54-56Google Scholar). The purification by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) of the pigments was essentially the same as in Refs. 19Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Google Scholar and 36Hohenfeld I.P. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 198-202Google Scholar. To remove nonspecifically bound proteins, the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was washed extensively with buffer W (0.1% n-dodecyl β-D maltoside (DM), 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm MES, 25 or 50 mm imidazole, pH 6.5). The histidine-tagged proteins were eluted with buffer E (0.1% DM, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm imidazole, pH 7.0). The purified B-DEFG/P-ABC sample was reconstituted into l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC, egg, Avanti, Alabaster, AL) liposomes by gently stirring with detergent-adsorbing biobeads (100 mg of biobeads/mg of protein; Bio-Rad) for3hat4 °C, in which the molar ratio of added PC was 50 times that of B-DEFG/P-ABC (19Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Google Scholar, 20Arakawa T. Shimono K. Yamaguchi S. Tuzi S. Sudo Y. Kamo N. Saito H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 237-240Google Scholar, 37Klare J.P. Schmies G. Chizhov I. Shimono K. Kamo N. Engelhard M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2156-2164Google Scholar). After removal of the biobeads by filtration, the reconstitution protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C and washed twice with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 200 mm NaCl.Absorption Spectroscopy and High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) Analysis—Spectra were obtained using a V-560 spectrophotometer (Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo, Japan). A sample was suspended in buffer E (see above). The retinal isomer ratio of pigments was determined using HPLC(model 800 series, Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo, Japan). Extraction of the retinal oxime from the sample was carried out using hexane after denaturation by methanol and 500 mm hydroxylamine (38Imamoto Y. Shichida Y. Hirayama J. Tomioka H. Kamo N. Yoshizawa T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2523-2528Google Scholar). HPLC was done as the same as described previously (30Shimono K. Ikeura Y. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Kamo N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1515: 92-100Google Scholar). For gaining the dark-adapted sample, B-DEFG/P-ABC was kept in the dark for 24 h at 4 °C. On the other hand, the light-adapted state was gained by illumination (> 520 nm (Y54 cut-off filter, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) for 2 min) and subsequent storage in the dark (5 min) at 4 °C.Spectrum Separation—The amounts of purified protein of some chimeric proteins, whose spectrum was not precisely determined due to contaminated proteins, were very low, so the spectrum separation was performed to estimate their λmax (25Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sumi M. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 141-145Google Scholar, 39Chizhov I. Schmies G. Seidel R. Sydor J.R. Luttenberg B. Engelhard M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 999-1009Google Scholar). The spectrum was fitted with five log-normal equations that are composed of four vibronic bands of the chromophore (these four components are the main band (λmax, 500 nm for wild type), the shoulder band (460 nm), the unknown band (412 nm), and the denatured band (364 nm)) and an additional band for the aromatic absorption of the protein. The fitting was performed using Origin software (version 5.0; Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). The equation, shown in Equation 1, is as follows, A(λ)=A×e−In 2(In ρ)2×[In{(1λ−1λmax)(ρ2−1)ρ×ω+1}]2(Eq. 1) where λmax is wavelength (nm); w is half-bandwidth (cm–1); ρ is parameter of skewness; A(λ) is absorbance; A is amplitude (39Chizhov I. Schmies G. Seidel R. Sydor J.R. Luttenberg B. Engelhard M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 999-1009Google Scholar). This analysis formula is most suitable for describing the broad asymmetrical absorption spectra of retinal proteins (40Metzler D.E. Harris C.M. Vision Res. 1978; 18: 1417-1420Google Scholar). The contribution of the background light scattering was fitted by a power function of reciprocal wavelengths such that α + (β/λ)γ.Spectroscopic Titrations—For spectroscopic titration in the absence of chloride, the chimeric proteins were suspended in six-mix buffer (citric acid, MES, Tricine, MOPS, CHES, and CAPS whose concentrations were 10 mm each) and 0.1% DM. The pH was first adjusted to almost 9 with 10 N NaOH. The titration was carried out from alkaline to acidic pH by adding 1 N H2SO4.RESULTSFig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the wild-type ppR, bR, and chimeric proteins separating at loop CD. In this study, a histidine tag at the C terminus was fused to all measured proteins. We have confirmed that the spectrum of the histidine-tagged wild-type ppR was the same as that of a native ppR from N. pharaonis (41Hirayama J. Imamoto Y. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Tomioka H. Yoshizawa T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2093-2098Google Scholar, 42Miyazaki M. Hirayama J. Hayakawa M. Kamo N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 22-29Google Scholar) and of the wild-type ppR expressed in E. coli in the DM solution (30Shimono K. Ikeura Y. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Kamo N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1515: 92-100Google Scholar). The removal of NaCl or imidazole or both did not change any of the absorption maximum and retinal configurations (data not shown). Thus, we deduced no influence of the composition of the suspending medium at least on the visible absorption spectrum and retinal configuration of the ground state. On the other hand, the bR-fusing histidine tag expressed in E. coli (ebRHis) has a shorter absorption maximum (λmax, 550 nm) than the native bR (λmax, 565 nm) (Fig. 2A) (43Varo G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 220-229Google Scholar). This blue-shifted λmax of bR expressed in E. coli is consistent with previous reports (36Hohenfeld I.P. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 198-202Google Scholar, 44Greenhalgh D.A. Farrens D.L. Subramaniam S. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20305-20311Google Scholar). This may be derived from the difference in the host cell lipid (E. coli or H. salinarum) or the difference in the protein-protein packing (monomer in the detergent or trimer in purple membrane). Therefore, we compared all the chimeric protein spectra with ebRHis in the DM solution (λmax, 550 nm) because we measured the spectra of the samples expressed in E. coli in detergent.Fig. 2UV-visible spectra (A–D) of two chimeric proteins, which are separated at loop CD.

Hu et al. (5Hu J. Griffin R.G. Herzfeld J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8880-8884Google Scholar) found, for halide salts of the all-trans PSB of retinal with aniline, that the frequency of the maximum absorption is linearly related to the inverse square of the center-to-center distance between the PSB and halide. The strengths of the hydrogen bond of PSB and internal water molecule around PSB in ppR differ from that in bR, based on an FT-IR study (19Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Google Scholar, 45Kandori H. Furutani Y. Shimono K. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15693-15698Google Scholar). This may indicate that the relative location between PSB and the counter ion residue (Asp-75) in ppR differs slightly from that in bR (between PSB and Asp-85). PSB and asparatate as its counter ion residue exist at helices G and C, respectively. Therefore, we first constructed two chimeric proteins separating at loop CD (B-ABC/P-DEFG and B-DEFG/P-ABC), where the genotype of B-ABC/P-DEFG is defined under “Experimental Procedures” (and also see the legend for Fig. 2). The amounts of expressed proteins of B-ABC/P-DEFG were not sufficient. The spectrum of B-ABC/P-DEFG was then calculated, and it is shown by the dotted line (Fig. 2B). For this calculation, we assumed that the shape of the B-ABC/P-DEFG spectrum would follow two log-normal equations (main and shoulder bands) as used in a previous study (25Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sumi M. Kamo N. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 141-145Google Scholar, 39Chizhov I. Schmies G. Seidel R. Sydor J.R. Luttenberg B. Engelhard M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 999-1009Google Scholar). From the observed and calculated spectra, the λmax of B-ABC/P-DEFG was concluded to be 506 nm (Fig. 2B). The parameters determined in the log-normal equation for B-ABC/P-DEFG are listed (see Table II).Table IIParameters of the log-normal fit of the spectra in Figs. 2 and 5λmaxWidth × 10-4AmplitudeSkewnessnmcm-1B-ABC/P-DEFG506.03 ± 1.082.5 ± 0.20.055 ± 0.0020.977 ± 0.089459.55 ± 6.622.4 ± 1.20.019 ± 0.0061.820 ± 0.723Baseline: α, 0.000 ± 0.095; β, 160.47 ± 9.40; γ, 3.506 ± 0.264χ2, 7.0 × 10-6B-DEF/P-ABCG526.90 ± 13.083.1 ± 1.00.039 ± 0.0741.181 ± 0.650535.99 ± 243.293.6 ± 11.80.004 ± 0.0710.842 ± 2.312Baseline: α, -0.005±0.098; β, 241.18.60±2.344; γ, 4.961±4.506χ2, 0.00004B-EF/P-ABCDG501.53 ± 10.412.7 ± 0.90.028 ± 0.0190.901 ± 0.298461.29 ± 6.361.4 ± 1.00.008 ± 0.0141.142 ± 0.955Baseline: α, -0.013±0.001; β, 207.86±5.10; γ, 5.267±0.785χ2, 0.00002B-DEG/P-ABCF542.34 ± 5.2662.6 ± 0.60.013 ± 0.0021.389 ± 0.426484.44 ± 734.9216 ± 2960.004 ± 0.0420.320 ± 4.369Baseline: α, -0.007±0.068; β, 230.53±5.44; γ, 4.657±1.028χ2, 0.00004 Open table in a new tab Next, to alter the environment between the counter ion residue (Asp-75) and PSB, we constructed the C helix chimera (B-C/P-ABDEFG). The expression in E. coli of this chimera was successful, and its λmax is 500 nm, which is the same as that of the wild-type ppR (data not shown). The environment around Asp-75 can be examined because the absorption maximum of the pigment largely shifts to longer wavelengths when Asp-75 is protonated (46Shimono K. Kitami M. Iwamoto M. Kamo N. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 87: 225-230Google Scholar), and we can take advantage of this phenomenon that pKa of Asp-75 can be estimated form the pH-dependent spectra. We estimated the pKa of Asp-75 in the C helix chimera (B-C/P-ABDEFG). As a result, its pKa was 3.8, which was similar to that of the wild type (pKa, 3.6) (46Shimono K. Kitami M. Iwamoto M. Kamo N. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 87: 225-230Google Scholar). Therefore, the environment around at least Asp-75 in B-C/PABDEFG is not changed from that in wild-type ppR. The substitution of helix C in ppR to bR did not alter its relative position against the PSB. This may be the reason why no shift in the absorption maximum of B-C/P-ABDEFG was observed. On the other hand, the λmax of B-DEFG/P-ABC was 545 nm, similar to that of bR expressed in E. coli (λmax, 550 nm) (Fig. 2, A and C). However, the amounts of purified sample were not more than that of the wild-type ppR, the same level as ebRHis, due to its instability in the DM micelle, so that its spectrum had a band around 400 nm (maybe due to the denatured sample) (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we analyzed the retinal configuration immediately after purification.Retinal Configuration of B-DEFG/P-ABC—In the dark, light-driven ion pumps (bR and hR) have all-trans and 13-cis retinal, whereas the photosensors (sR and pR) are only all-trans (38Imamoto Y. Shichida Y. Hirayama J. Tomioka H. Kamo N. Yoshizawa T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2523-2528Google Scholar). This difference in the retinal isomer composition may be related to the difference in function (pump or sensor). The molecular mechanism of having only all-trans retinal in the photosensors is not known. It might be postulated that the environment around the chromophore reflects the retinal isomer composition because the all-trans form of the retinal might be the most stable if no interaction is exerted in an organic solvent. Which retinal isomers does B-DEFG/P-ABC, which has the large red-shifted absorption spectrum, have? In the DM micelle, B-DEFG/P-ABC has 13-cis re"

Although the role of SHIP-1 has been extensively studied, the role of SHIP-2 in myeloid cell functions is not known. Here, we have analyzed the expression patterns, molecular mechanism of activation, and function of SHIP-2 in human myeloid cell Fcγ receptor (FcγR) signaling.

Treatment of peripheral blood monocytes with bacterial lipopolysaccharide induced expression of SHIP-2 in a dose-dependent manner. FcγRIIa clustering in THP-1 cells induced SHIP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting a role for SHIP-2 in modulating FcγR-mediated function. Consistent with this notion, overexpression of wild-type SHIP-2 (but not catalytically deficient SHIP-2) in THP-1 cells almost completely abrogated NFκB-mediated gene transcription in response to FcγRIIa clustering. Furthermore, FcγRIIa-induced Akt activation was blocked by wild-type SHIP-2, but not by a catalytically deficient mutant of SHIP-2. Additional experiments analyzing the molecular mechanism of SHIP-2 induction by FcγRIIa revealed that SHIP-2 associated with the phosphorylated FcγRIIa immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif via the SHIP-2 SH2 domain. Thus, an SH2 domain mutant of SHIP-2 failed to associate with FcγRIIa or to become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FcγRIIa clustering. Finally, we also demonstrate that SHIP-2 phosphorylation was induced by FcγRI clustering in THP-1 cells.

Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). The process of phagocytosis is accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen radicals, as well as the production of inflammatory cytokines, all of which cause tissue damage. Thus, the phagocytic process must be subject to tight regulation. Human monocytes and macrophages express three classes of FcγR (2Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). FcγRI, FcγRIIa, and FcγRIII are activating receptors that are associated with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). In contrast, FcγRIIb is an inhibitory receptor that bears in its cytoplasmic tail a tyrosine-based inhibitory motif that predominantly recruits negative regulatory phosphatases and causes down-regulation of activation events. In addition to the regulatory role of FcγRIIb, recent studies have revealed that the FcγR ITAMs are often capable of simultaneously activating positive and negative regulatory proteins such that the final biologic response is tempered. We (3Tridandapani S. Wang Y. Marsh C.B. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 169: 4370-4378Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and others (4Nakamura K. Malykhin A. Coggeshall K.M. Blood. 2002; 100: 3374-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that FcγR ITAMs are capable of recruiting and activating the inositol phosphatase SHIP-1. Other studies have shown that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (5Kant A.M. De P. Peng X. Yi T. Rawlings D.J. Kim J.S. Durden D.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the dual phosphatase PTEN (6Kim J.S. Peng X. De P.K. Geahlen R.L. Durden D.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) also serve to regulate FcγR-mediated macrophage functions. Thus, it is clear that FcγR-mediated activation of macrophages is subject to multiple levels of regulation, which are not fully understood. In this report, we present molecular details of a novel regulatory influence exerted by the recently identified inositol phosphatase SHIP-2. FcγR clustering in monocytes and macrophages initiates a biochemical cascade that begins with the activation of the Src kinases that phosphorylate the ITAMs of FcγR (7Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 844-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, the ITAMs serve as docking sites for several signaling enzymes and enzyme-adapter complexes, including the Syk tyrosine kinase (8Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.-M. Coggeshall K.M.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which serves to recruit the Grb2-Sos complex, leading to activation of the Ras pathway. Association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with the ITAM places the enzyme in proximity with its lipid substrates, resulting in the generation of the important lipid second messenger PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 is critical for the activation of PH domain-containing enzymes such as Btk (11Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z.M. Lin S.Q. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J.

SHIP-2 is an inositol 5′-phosphatase that has high level homology to SHIP-1 in its catalytic region (16Giuriato S. Payrastre B. Drayer A.L. Plantavid M. Woscholski R. Parker P. Erneux C. Chap H. J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The molecules are largely divergent in the C-terminal region, consisting of a proline-rich domain that associates with unique SH3 domain-containing proteins (19Wisniewski D. Strife A. Swendeman S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Kavanaugh W.M. Tempst P. Clarkson B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2707-2720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, whereas SHIP-1 has two tyrosine residues in the C terminus that conform to an NPXY motif shown to bind phosphotyrosine-binding domains upon phosphorylation, SHIP-2 has only one NPXY motif (20Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, while enzymatically similar, these two enzymes likely differ in functions that are related to their protein interactions via the C-terminal region. These two molecules also differ in their expression patterns: SHIP-1 is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells, whereas SHIP-2 is much more ubiquitously expressed (20Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed a role for SHIP-2 in regulating insulin receptor signaling (21Blero D. De Smedt F. Pesesse X. Paternotte N. Moreau C. Payrastre B. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Other studies have demonstrated a role for SHIP-2 in mediating the inhibitory effect of FcγRIIb in B cells (21Blero D. De Smedt F. Pesesse X. Paternotte N. Moreau C. Payrastre B. Erneux C. Biochem.

However, the expression and function of SHIP-2 in monocytes and macrophages are not known. In this study, we first demonstrate that SHIP-2 was expressed in human alveolar macrophages, but was almost undetectable in peripheral blood monocytes derived from the same donors. Interestingly, expression of SHIP-2 in PBMs was induced by bacterial LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Second, FcγRIIa clustering in the human myeloid cell line THP-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP-2, suggesting that SHIP-2 may play a role in FcγR-mediated function. Analyzing the functional consequence of SHIP-2 in FcγRIIa signaling, we report that overexpression of wild-type SHIP-2 (but not catalytically deficient SHIP-2) completely abrogated NFκB-dependent gene transcription in response to FcγRIIa clustering in THP-1 cells. Transient cotransfection experiments in COS-7 cells demonstrated that wild-type SHIP-2 down-regulated FcγRIIa-induced Akt phosphorylation. Additional experiments analyzing the molecular mechanism of SHIP-2 activation by FcγRIIa demonstrated that the SH2 domain of SHIP-2 was necessary for optimal association of SHIP-2 with FcγRIIa and for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP-2. Finally, we also demonstrate that FcγRI clustering resulted in phosphorylation of SHIP-2, suggesting that SHIP-2 may regulate both FcγRIIa- and FcγRI-mediated myeloid cell function. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—THP-1, U937, and COS-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All other cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Anti-FcγRI antibody 197 and anti-FcγRIIa antibody IV.3 were obtained from Medarex (Annandale, NJ).

Goat polyclonal anti-SHIP-2 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phospho-Akt, and anti-Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Syk antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Charlottesville, VA). Anti-Xpress antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Isolation of PBMs—CD14-positive PBMs were isolated as described previously (26Tridandapani S. Lyden T.W. Smith J.L. Carter J.E. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were first isolated by density gradient centrifugation over Histopaque (Sigma). Monocytes were then purified from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by negative selection using the MACs monocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech). For this, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were first treated with FcγR blocking reagent (human IgG), followed by a hapten/antibody mixture (mixture of hapten-conjugated monoclonal anti-CD3, anti-CD7, anti-CD19, anti-CD45RA, anti-CD56, and anti-IgE antibodies). The labeled cells were further treated with MACS anti-hapten magnetic microbeads conjugated to monoclonal anti-hapten antibody. The cells were then passed over a MACS column, and the effluent was collected as the negative fraction representing enriched monocytes. Preparation of Human Alveolar Macrophages—Macrophages were obtained from healthy donors by bronchoalveolar lavage. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, counted, and analyzed by Diff-Quick staining for purity. Cell preparations were >95% positive for macrophages. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—THP-1 cells and transfected COS-7 cells were activated by clustering FcγRI and or FcγRIIa with monoclonal antibody 197 or Fab fragments of antibody IV.3 and goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody. Resting and activated cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin), and post-nuclear lysates were incubated overnight with the antibody of interest and protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) or goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig covalently linked to Sepharose, depending on the antibody. Immune complexes bound to beads were washed with buffer A and boiled in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, probed with the antibody of interest, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoblot Data Quantitation—The ECL signal was quantitated using a scanner and a densitometry program (Scion Image). To quantitate the phosphorylation signals in the activated samples, we first subtracted background, normalized the phosphorylation signal to the amount of total precipitated protein, and plotted the values obtained by expressing them as -fold increase over the values in unstimulated samples. Transfection—COS-7 cells were transfected as described previously (3Tridandapani S. Wang Y. Marsh C.B. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 169: 4370-4378Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on culture dishes to 60–70% confluency. cDNA for FcγRIIa in pCEXV3 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Ravetch, Rockefeller University, New York) and cDNAs for wild-type SHIP-2, the inactive SH2 domain mutant of SHIP-2, and the inactive catalytic domain mutant of SHIP-2 in pcDNA3 (generously provided by Dr. Shonna Moodie, Metabolex Inc., Hayward, CA) (27Taylor V.

The DNA mixture was added to cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested 24 h later and analyzed for expression of the transfected cDNAs by Western blotting. Having ensured that the various transfectants expressed comparable levels of protein, we then examined the ability of the wild-type and mutant SHIP-2 molecules to associate with the FcγRIIa ITAM and to become tyrosine-phosphorylated. In other experiments, GST-Akt (a kind gift from Dr. R. B. Pearson, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Australia) (28Conus N.M. Hannan K.M. Cristiano B.E. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol.

Transfection of THP-1 Cells and Luciferase Assays—For analysis of SHIP-2 influence on NFκB transcriptional activity, THP-1 cells were transfected as described previously (3Tridandapani S. Wang Y. Marsh C.B. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 169: 4370-4378Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, THP-1 cells were electroporated (310 V, 950 microfarads; Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II) with 5 μg of wild-type SHIP-2 or catalytically deficient SHIP-2 in pcDNA3, 1 μgof NFκB-luciferase plasmid, and 0.5 μg of pEGFP to normalize for transfection efficiency. Transfectants were harvested 24 h later and activated by clustering FcγRIIa by the methods described above for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in 100 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega luciferase assay reagent. Data are represented as graphs indicating the percent induction of NFκB activity in cells activated by clustering FcγRIIa over the activity in cells that were not activated. Data points are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. SHIP-2 Expression Pattern in Myeloid Cells—Expression of SHIP-2 in myeloid cells was assessed by Western blotting protein-matched lysates obtained from the THP-1 and U937 human monocytic cell lines, the P388D1 mouse myeloid cell line, and primary human PBMs and alveolar macrophages. The results shown in Fig. 1A (upper panels) demonstrate that SHIP-2 was expressed in the transformed myeloid cell lines and in primary human alveolar macrophages. Interestingly, PBMs appeared to express very low levels of SHIP-2 compared with alveolar macrophages from the same donor. The results were consistently observed in five separate donors. A reprobe of the membranes with anti-β-actin antibody (Fig. 1A, lower panels) showed equivalent loading of protein in the different lanes. Treatment of PBMs with LPS, a reagent often used to activate PBMs, resulted in increased expression of SHIP-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, upper panel). These data suggest that SHIP-2 is inducibly expressed in human monocytes. SHIP-2 Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated and Serves to Down-regulate FcγRIIa-mediated Function—To test whether SHIP-2 is involved in FcγR-mediated myeloid cell activation, SHIP-2 phosphorylation was assessed in THP-1 cells stimulated by clustering FcγRIIa (Fig. 2A). For this, FcγRIIa receptors were clustered using Fab fragments of monoclonal anti-FcγRIIa antibody IV.3, followed by F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG. SHIP-2 was immunoprecipitated from resting and activated cells with goat polyclonal anti-SHIP-2 antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The results indicate that FcγRIIa clustering induced SHIP-2 phosphorylation within 1 min and that the phosphorylation signals peaked at ∼7 min and subsided by 30 min post-stimulation (Fig. 2A, upper panel). A reprobe of the same membrane with anti-SHIP-2 antibody revealed equal loading of SHIP-2 in all lanes. The seventh lane is a negative control immunoprecipitation with normal goat IgG (Fig. 2A, lower panel). In a second set of experiments, human PBMs cultured overnight with 100 ng/ml LPS were stimulated by clustering FcγRIIa, and SHIP-2 phosphorylation was assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2B (upper panel), SHIP-2 phosphorylation was induced by FcγRIIa clustering in PBMs. Fig. 2B (lower panel) demonstrates equivalent loading of SHIP-2 in the two lanes. Having ensured that SHIP-2 is phosphorylated during FcγRIIa signaling, we next assessed whether SHIP-2 influences FcγRIIa-mediated functional outcomes. We (3Tridandapani S. Wang Y. Marsh C.B. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 169: 4370-4378Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and others (10Sánchez-Mejorada G. Rosales C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) have previously reported that FcγR clustering induces NFκB-mediated gene transcription, which is down-regulated by the inositol phosphatase SHIP-1. Because SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 are both capable of hydrolyzing PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and influence downstream events, we analyzed whether SHIP-2 plays a role in regulating NFκB-mediated gene transcription. In these experiments, we analyzed NFκB-dependent transcription from a reporter plasmid encoding the luciferase gene in the presence of excess wild-type SHIP-2 or the catalytically deficient SHIP-2 mutant D608A. Thus, THP-1 cells were transiently cotransfected with the NFκB-luciferase plasmid and with plasmids encoding wild-type SHIP-2 or catalytically deficient SHIP-2. The transfected cells were activated by clustering FcγRIIa for 5 h at 37 °C. Transcription of the luciferase gene was measured by a luciferase enzyme assay as described above. The results are expressed as percent increase in luciferase activity in cells activated by clustering FcγRIIa over the activity in resting cells (Fig. 2C). The data indicate that NFκB-dependent transcription of the luciferase gene occurred upon FcγRIIa clustering. However, overexpression of wild-type SHIP-2 blocked the induction of gene transcription (p = 0.027, presence of exogenous wild-type SHIP-2 versus pcDNA3 empty vector). Importantly, gene transcription was significantly enhanced in the presence of dominant-negative, catalytically deficient SHIP-2 (p = 0.006, presence of exogenous catalytically deficient SHIP-2 versus pcDNA3 empty vector), suggesting that SHIP-2 serves to down-regulate NFκB-dependent gene transcription by FcγRIIa. Recent studies have demonstrated an upstream role for Akt in NFκB activation (15Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Because Akt is a PH domain-containing enzyme whose activity is regulated by PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, a substrate of SHIP-2, we next analyzed Akt activation in the presence of overexpressed wild-type SHIP-2 or catalytically deficient SHIP-2. For these experiments, COS-7 fibroblasts were used to achieve high levels of transfection. Thus, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected to express epitope (GST)-tagged Akt along with FcγRIIa (COS-7 cells do not express any endogenous FcγR) and either wild-type SHIP-2 or the catalytically deficient SHIP-2 mutant D608A. The transfected cells were harvested 24 h later and activated by clustering FcγRIIa by the methods described above. Whole cell lysates from resting and activated cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphoserine Akt antibody (Fig. 3A, upper panel). GST-Akt migrated at ∼95 kDa in comparison with endogenous Akt, which migrated at 65 kDa. The slower migration of GST-Akt allowed for analysis of the effect of overexpression of the SHIP-2 proteins on cotransfected GST-Akt. The membrane was reprobed with anti-Akt antibody to detect the total amount of GST-Akt present in each lane (Fig. 3A, middle panel). Fig. 3A demonstrates that GST-Akt was serine-phosphorylated upon FcγRIIa clustering (fourth lane) in comparison with the resting sample (third lane). Overexpression of wild-type SHIP-2 down-regulated FcγRIIa-induced Akt phosphorylation (compare the fifth and sixth lanes). In contrast, overexpression of catalytically deficient SHIP-2 resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of Akt in response to FcγRIIa clustering (eighth lane), suggesting that catalytically deficient SHIP-2 functions in a dominant-negative manner, overcoming the inhibition of Akt by endogenous SHIP-2 (fourth lane). Akt phosphorylation was quantitated by normalizing phospho-Akt (GST) signals to total Akt (GST) signals as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are expressed as -fold increase in Akt phosphorylation in activated cells in comparison with that in resting cells. Fig. 3A (lower panel) represents the mean ± S.D. of values obtained from three independent experiments. The inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by wild-type SHIP-2 was statistically significant (p = 0.02). To ensure that transfected FcγRIIa was expressed to comparable levels in the different transfectants, WCLs were probed with anti-FcγRIIa antibody (Fig. 3B). Likewise, expression of Xpress-tagged wild-type and catalytically deficient SHIP-2 was comparable in the transfected cells as shown in Fig. 3C. These data suggest that SHIP-2 down-regulates FcγRIIa-induced Akt phosphorylation. SHIP-2 Associates with the Phosphorylated ITAM of FcγRIIa—SHIP-2 is a cytoplasmic protein whose activity is regulated by subcellular localization, i.e. SHIP-2 must translocate to the membrane to access its lipid substrates (20Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether FcγRIIa provides a docking site for SHIP-2 in the following experiments. First, we used biotinylated peptides derived from the ITAM of FcγRIIa that were either non-phosphorylated or doubly phosphorylated at the tyrosine residues. These peptides were applied to THP-1 lysates, and the peptide-bound material was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-SHIP-2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A (upper panel), SHIP-2 associated with the doubly phosphorylated FcγRIIa ITAM peptide, but not with the non-phosphorylated peptide. A WCL from THP-1 cells is shown in the third lane. To ensure that the binding of SHIP-2 to the phosphorylated ITAM peptide was specific, the same membrane was reprobed with anti-Syk antibody (Fig. 4A, lower panel). As previously reported, the phosphorylated ITAM of FcγRIIa bound Syk (9Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In a second set of experiments, we investigated whether native FcγRIIa associates with SHIP-2 upon receptor clustering. Here, THP-1 cells were activated by clustering FcγRIIa for 5 min. FcγRIIa was immunoprecipitated from resting and activated cells, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed for the presence of SHIP-2 by Western blotting. The results show that SHIP-2 was capable of associating with FcγRIIa in an activation-dependent manner (Fig. 4B, upper panel). A reprobe of the same membrane indicated equal loading of FcγRIIa in both resting and activated samples. Taken together, the results suggest that SHIP-2 translocates to the membrane upon FcγRIIa clustering by associating with the phosphorylated ITAM of FcγRIIa. The SH2 Domain of SHIP-2 Is Required for Association with the FcγRIIa ITAM—The above finding that SHIP-2 associates with the phosphorylated ITAM of FcγRIIa suggests that the interaction may be mediated via the SH2 domain of SHIP-2. To formally test this possibility, COS-7 fibroblasts were transfected to express epitope (Xpress)-tagged wild-type SHIP-2, R47L SHIP-2 (SH2 domain mutant), or D608A SHIP-2 (catalytically deficient mutant). The tagged SHIP-2 proteins were assessed for their ability to bind the FcγRIIa ITAM in a peptide binding assay. Thus, the peptide-bound material was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Xpress antibody. The results indicate that the SH2 domain mutant of SHIP-2 was unable to associate optimally with the phosphopeptide (Fig. 5A, third lane). In contrast, both wild-type SHIP-2 and catalytically deficient SHIP-2 were able to efficiently bind the phosphorylated ITAM peptide (second and fourth lanes). No signal was seen in the first lane, as these cells were not transfected with the Xpress-tagged SHIP-2 proteins. To ensure that the lack of binding observed with the SH2 domain mutant was not due to lack of expression of the transfected protein, parallel immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-Xpress antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-SHIP-2 antibody (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C is a quantitative measure of the percent of Xpress-tagged SHIP-2 that bound to the phosphorylated ITAM of FcγRIIa. The data represent the mean ± S.D. of values obtained from three independent experiments. The SH2 Domain of SHIP-2 Is Necessary for FcγRIIa-induced SHIP-2 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—As an additional approach to determine the importance of the SH2 domain of SHIP-2 in its association with FcγRIIa and thereby its translocation to the membrane, we next assessed whether SH2 domain mutants of SHIP-2 would become phosphorylated upon FcγRIIa clustering. Here, COS-7 cells were transfected to express FcγRIIa along with wild-type SHIP-2, R47L SHIP-2 (SH2 domain mutant), or D608A SHIP-2 (catalytically deficient mutant). SHIP-2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from resting and activated cells, which had been activated by clustering FcγRIIa, using anti-Xpress antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The results indicate that, although both wild-type SHIP-2 and catalytically deficient SHIP-2 became tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FcγRIIa clustering, the SH2 domain mutant of SHIP-2 failed to become phosphorylated (Fig. 6A, upper panel). A reprobe of the membrane with anti-SHIP-2 antibody showed the presence of SHIP-2 in all lanes (Fig. 6A, middle panel). The phosphorylation level of SHIP-2 was quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” normalized for the amount of total SHIP-2 present in each lane, and expressed as -fold increase in SHIP-2 phosphorylation in the activated samples over that in resting samples. The graph in Fig. 6A (lower panel) represents the mean ± S.D. of values obtained from three independent experiments. To ensure that the lack of phosphorylation of the SH2 domain mutant of SHIP-2 was not due to lack of expression of FcγRIIa in these cells, WCLs from the transfectants were probed with anti-FcγRIIa antibody (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these data indicate that the SH2 domain of SHIP-2 is necessary for the association of SHIP-2 with FcγRIIa. SHIP-2 Is Phosphorylated by FcγRI Clustering in THP-1 Cells—In additional experiments, THP-1 cells were activated by clustering FcγRI with monoclonal antibody 197, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG. SHIP-2 phosphorylation was assessed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 7A, upper panel). Fig. 7A (lower panel) is a reprobe with anti-SHIP-2 antibody to ensure equal loading of SHIP-2 in all lanes. The results indicate that SHIP-2 was indeed invoked upon FcγRI clustering in THP-1 cells. Because our data indicated that SHIP-2 associated with the phosphorylated ITAM of FcγRIIa, we next analyzed whether a similar association might exist between SHIP-2 and the phosphorylated ITAM of the FcγR γ-chain. For this, biotinylated peptides corresponding to the ITAM of the γ-chain that were either non-phosphorylated or doubly phosphorylated were applied to THP-1 lysates. The peptide-bound material was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-SHIP-2 antibody. The results shown in Fig. 7B (upper panel) indicate that the phosphorylated ITAM of the γ-chain was incapable of association with SHIP-2. To ensure that the phosphopeptide used in these experiments is functional, the same membrane was reprobed with anti-Syk antibody (Fig. 7B, lower panel). As shown, the phosphopeptide efficiently bound Syk, consistent with earlier reports (2Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). These data suggest that SHIP-2 translocation to the membrane in response to FcγRI clustering might involve adapter molecules or membrane-associated proteins other than the γ-chain. Further analysis is needed to resolve these issues. FcγR-mediated phagocytosis is regulated by a complex set of phosphatases, each using a distinct molecular mechanism for mediating its inhibitory function. Thus, recent reports have implicated the inositol phosphatase SHIP-1 in modulating FcγR-mediated macrophage function, including phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles (4Nakamura K. Malykhin A. Coggeshall K.M. Blood. 2002; 100: 3374-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Cox D. Dale B.M. Kishiwada M. Helgason C.D. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and induction of gene transcription (3Tridandapani S. Wang Y. Marsh C.B. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 169: 4370-4378Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Likewise, Durden and co-workers have demonstrated a role for the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (5Kant A.M. De P. Peng X. Yi T. Rawlings D.J. Kim J.S. Durden D.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for PTEN (6Kim J.S. Peng X. De P.K. Geahlen R.L. Durden D.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in down-regulating phagocytosis. Although it is clear that to limit the tissue damage caused by the reactive oxygen and nitrogen radicals and the inflammatory cytokines that accompany phagocytosis, this process must be subject to tight regulation, the mechanisms involved in this regulation are not fully understood. In this study, we have analyzed the molecular details of a novel level of regulation exerted by the inositol phosphatase SHIP-2. Our results indicate that SHIP-2 associates with the ITAM of FcγRIIa via the SH2 domain of SHIP-2 and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated. As in the case of SHIP-1, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP-2 does not influence SHIP-2 enzyme activity. However, because membrane translocation of SHIP-2 is necessary for SHIP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinases (30Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and because membrane translocation puts SHIP-2 in the proximity of its lipid substrates, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP-2 serves as a correlate of SHIP-2 activation. Our data also demonstrate that SHIP-2 serves to down-regulate FcγRIIa-induced activation of Akt and NFκB-dependent gene transcription, as overexpression of wild-type SHIP-2 (but not catalytically deficient SHIP-2) almost completely abrogates these two events. Both SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 mediate their inhibitory effects via the SH2 domains, which are reported to have 54% homology. Thus, it must be noted that the enhanced activation of NFκB-dependent luciferase gene induction by the dominant-negative SHIP-2 mutant D608A used in the transfection studies in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2C) may be the result of competition of D608A SHIP-2 with both endogenous SHIP-1 and SHIP-2. In contrast to the association of SHIP-2 with the FcγRIIa ITAM, we were unable to detect any binding of SHIP-2 to the phosphorylated ITAM of the FcγRI-associated γ-chain, despite the fact that SHIP-2 was efficiently phosphorylated upon FcγRI clustering (Fig. 7). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a very weak association of SHIP-2 with the γ-chain that became apparent only when the Western blot was overexposed (data not shown). Based on the results of Fig. 7, we suggest that SHIP-2 association with the γ-chain is likely mediated via adapter molecules or that the association may be weak and transient and is disrupted by the detergent-based lysis buffer. In a recent report, Mitchell and co-workers (31Dyson J.M. O'Malley C.J. Becanovic J. Munday A.D. Berndt M.C. Coghill I.D. Nandurkar H.H. Ooms L.M. Mitchell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) demonstrated an association of SHIP-2 with the actin-binding protein filamin. This association is mediated via the C-terminal proline-rich domain of SHIP-2 and the SH3 domain of filamin. Because filamin is known to be associated with FcγRI (reviewed in Ref. 32Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) in macrophages, it is possible that FcγRI clustering recruits SHIP-2 via filamin. Nonetheless, our data indicate that FcγRI clustering induces tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP-2, suggesting a role for SHIP-2 in regulating FcγRI-mediated events. Interestingly, SHIP-2 expression in human PBMs is almost undetectable, but is induced upon activation of these cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Similar findings were recently reported by Cambier and co-workers (24Brauweiler A. Tamir I. Marschner S. Helgason C.D. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in murine B cells. It is tempting to speculate that the induction of SHIP-2 by LPS is a mechanism employed by Gram-negative bacteria to suppress the host immune response so that the pathogen may evade the phagocytic machinery. Numerous earlier studies have reported that LPS attenuates FcγR-mediated phagocytosis (33Sundaram R. O'Connor M. Cicero M. Ghaffar A. Gangemi J.D. Mayer E.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 34Wonderling R.S. Ghaffar A. Mayer E.P. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 1996; 18: 267-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which LPS mediates its suppressive effect has thus far remained elusive. Further studies are underway to investigate the details of LPS induction of SHIP-2 expression and the functional consequence on FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. Finally, is not clear why myeloid cells express two inositol 5′-phosphatases, SHIP-1 and SHIP-2. Our data suggest that these two molecules may not be coexpressed at all times. Furthermore, although the results of this study demonstrate overlapping functions for SHIP-1 and SHIP-2, i.e. inhibition of Akt and NFκB activation, it is likely that these two phosphatases mediate additional and non-overlapping effects on signaling pathways. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that the C-terminal proline-rich regions of SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 are quite different, leading to association of a distinct sets of SH3 domain-containing molecules (19Wisniewski D. Strife A. Swendeman S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Kavanaugh W.M. Tempst P. Clarkson B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2707-2720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which likely influence distinct signaling pathways. We are currently investigating the functional differences between SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 in FcγR-mediated activation of monocytes and macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1967071130,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), a member of the large basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and PAS homology domain superfamily, is a highly conserved transcriptional regulator involved in mammalian development. In the present study, a murine metanephros organ culture system was employed to evaluate the role of the Ahr signaling in nephrogenesis in vitro. Ahr and Wilms' tumor suppressor (wt1) mRNAs were detected by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR during the course of renal development. Treatment with 3 microM BaP, a hydrocarbon ligand of Ahr, inhibited glomerulogenesis and branching morphogenesis of metanephric kidneys. Deficits in the epithelialization of mesenchymal cells were evidenced by inhibition of the formation of podocyte foot processes and glomerular basement membranes. Hydrocarbon treatment markedly induced -KTS wt1 splice variants, although total wt1 mRNA levels remained unchanged. A significant decrease in total WT1 protein was observed by both immunocytochemistry and Western analysis in cultures challenged with BaP compared to controls. Comparison of metanephric cultures from Ahr+/+ and Ahr-/- mice showed that Ahr is involved in kidney development, and required for BaP-induced deficits in nephrogenesis. These results indicate that ligand activation of Ahr signaling disrupts nephrogenesis in vitro, and that this response involves modulation of wt1 alternative splicing and post-transcriptional control."
https://openalex.org/W2019717408,"IQGAP1, a putative downstream target of the Rho family small G proteins, Cdc42 and Rac, localizes at adherens junctions (AJs) in epithelial cells. It has been suggested that IQGAP1 localizes at AJs through its binding to β-catenin, and negatively regulates the E-cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion. Nectin is a Ca2+-independent, immunoglobulin-like cell–cell adhesion molecule that localizes at AJs. Nectin is associated with E-cadherin through their respective cytoplasmic tail-binding proteins, afadin and catenins, and involved in the formation of AJs cooperatively with E-cadherin. Here we investigated a role of nectin in the localization of IQGAP1 at AJs. Ca2+ chelation from the medium causes disruption of the E-cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion, but not the nectin-based cell–cell adhesion, in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. IQGAP1 remained at the residual nectin-based cell–cell adhesion sites where the E-cadherin immunofluorescence signal disappeared. Restoration of Ca2+ in the medium causes re-accumulation of E-cadherin to the residual nectin-based cell–cell adhesion sites to re-form AJs. Nectin inhibitors inhibit this re-accumulation of E-cadherin to re-form AJs by impairing the nectin-based cell–cell adhesion. The nectin inhibitors also reduced the localization of IQGAP1 at the cell–cell adhesion sites. When MDCK cells were incubated with microbeads coated with the extracellular fragment of nectin that interacts with cellular nectin, IQGAP1 also accumulated at the bead–MDCK cell contact sites. The accumulation of IQGAP1 at the cell–cell adhesion sites was inhibited by actin filament-disrupting agents, latrunculin A and cytochalasin D. These results indicate that nectin is involved in the localization of IQGAP1 at AJs through the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2148093041,"Striated muscle tropomyosin (TM) interacts with actin and the troponin complex to regulate calcium-mediated muscle contraction. Previous work by our laboratory established that α- and β-TM isoforms elicit physiological differences in sarcomeric performance.

TM regulates sarcomeric performance through its binding to actin and the troponin complex. During muscle relaxation when cytoplasmic levels of calcium are low, tropomyosin blocks the myosin-binding site on the filamentous striated muscle actin. Upon stimulation, calcium is released into the myofilament space from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, via the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel, and from extracellular stores; this calcium binds to troponin C within the troponin complex, which causes a conformational change in the position of TM on actin, thereby exposing the myosin-binding site. Myosin binds to actin and triggers muscle contractile activity until the stimulation ceases, and calcium is re-sequestered into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Recent studies (1Muthuchamy M. Grupp I.

The α-TM isoform is the predominant isoform in both skeletal and cardiac musculature. In the adult murine heart, this isoform constitutes ∼98% of the total TM. The remaining 2% of TM is β-TM, which is 86% identical to α-TM. In the skeletal musculature, β-TM expression is much greater, with levels dependent upon the specific muscle. TPM 3 (TM 30sk, γ-TM) is not expressed in the murine heart but is found in slow-twitch skeletal musculature, such as the soleus where it composes ∼30% of all the TMs (4Pieples K. Wieczorek D.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8291-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The TPM 3 isoform is 93% identical to α-TM and is 86% identical to β-TM. Studies in our laboratory using transgenic mice that express β-TM in the heart demonstrate that β-TM increases the sensitivity of the cardiac myofilaments to calcium (5Palmiter K. Kitada Y. Muthuchamy M. Wieczorek D.F. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11611-11614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This increase leads to a delay in the relaxation rate of the heart, and these hearts do not relax completely (1Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When β-TM is expressed at high levels in the heart, the mice die due to defects in both contraction and relaxation (2Muthuchamy M. Boivin G. Grupp I. Wieczorek D.F. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1545-1557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Additional studies (6Wolska B. Keller R. Evans C. Palmiter K. Phillips R. Muthuchamy M. Oehlenschlager J.

The regions within TM that associate with troponin T are amino acids 175–190 and 258 –284. Experiments carried out in vitro show that removal of the TM carboxyl-terminal amino acids by digestion with carboxypeptidase results in the loss of both affinity for actin and the ability to polymerize (8Butters C. Willadsen K. Tobacman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15565-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dabrowska R. Nowak E. Drabikowski W. J. Muscle Res.

Their removal also impairs the cooperative interaction of TM with the myosin S1 region (11Heeley D. Smillie L. Lohmeier-Vogel E. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Pan B. Gordon A. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8495-8498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of non-muscle α-TM for muscle carboxyl-terminal amino acids affects TM-actin and TM-troponin affinities (13Hammell R. Hitchcock-DeGregori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The focus of the present investigation was to selectively modify the isoform of the α-TM carboxyl terminus to provide in vivo information about the role of this domain in the mechanism of muscle contraction and its interaction with actin and the troponin complex. To address this, we substituted the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of α-TM for that of the striated muscle β-TM isoform. This substitution maintains the conserved length of 284 amino acids for TM molecules, whereas we could assess the importance of this region in TM function. By using a transgenic mouse approach, we generated a DNA construct that encodes a TM molecule consisting of α-TM sequence from amino acids 1 to 257 and β-TM sequence from amino acids 258 to 284. This chimeric TM is expressed only in cardiac myocytes and is incorporated into the myofilaments. The incorporation of this protein did not result in any morphological or pathological alterations. However, when amino acids 258 –284 of β-TM substitute for their corresponding α-TM counterparts, there are significant decreases in rates of contraction and relaxation when assayed by work-performing ex vivo heart analyses. There are increases in the time to peak pressure, and a tendency toward an increased time of half-relaxation. Intraventricular pressure was significantly decreased, and there was a dramatic increase in end diastolic pressure. Maximum developed tension and ATPase rate, as well as calcium sensitivity of skinned α/β-TM fiber bundles, were depressed. The results of this study demonstrate that the terminal 27 amino acids of TM are critical determinants of sarcomere performance and myofilament calcium sensitivity in both the whole heart and in isolated myofilaments. Generation of α-/β-TM Transgenic Mice—The mouse wild-type α-TM striated muscle-specific cDNA was generated using PCR primers that amplified from amino acids 1 to 257. The mouse wild-type β-TM striated muscle cDNA was PCR-generated using primers that amplified from amino acids 258 to 284 and through the entire 3′-untranslated region (UTR). These amplified fragments were isolated, purified, and blunt-end ligated to join at the amino acid 257–258 junction. Nucleotide sequencing and comparison with the published sequences verified the amplified sequences. The chimeric α-/β-TM cDNA was linked at the 5′ end to the 5.5-kb murine α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) cardiac-specific promoter. The SV40 polyadenylation and termination sequence (0.24 kb) was ligated at the 3′ end of the minigene construct. The construct was linearized, purified, and microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized ova to generate transgenic mice as described (1Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Transgenic (TG) mice were produced using the FVB/N strain. Founder mice were identified by use of PCR primers corresponding to the α-MHC 5′-UTR and α-TM as the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. Genomic Southern blot analysis confirmed the founder mice. Six chimeric TM transgenic lines were established and distinguished from their non-transgenic (NTG) cohorts by PCR. RNA and Protein Analysis—RNA was isolated from murine hearts using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Total RNA (10 μg) from each transgenic line and control mouse ventricles was electrophoresed on 1% formaldehyde gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Hybridization was conducted with 32P-radiolabeled cDNA fragments from the α-TM and β-TM 3′-UTRs and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). TM message levels were analyzed on ImageQuant PhosphorImager and normalized to GAPDH expression levels. Myofibrillar proteins were prepared from ventricular myocardium as described (1Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (25 μg) were run on two 10% SDS-PAGE gels. One gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm equal protein loading, and proteins from the other gel were transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. The filter was incubated with a striated muscle TM-specific antibody (CH1) (Sigma). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed on myofibrillar protein preparations from NTG and TG (line 14) hearts according to the method of O'Farrell (14O'Farrell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, isoelectric focusing was carried out using 25 μg of the protein sample denatured in 300 μl of rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2 mm tributylphosphine, 2% CHAPS, 0.2% Bio-Lytes (4.7–5.9) (Bio-Rad)). Each sample was used to hydrate a 17-cm ReadyStrip pH 4.7–5.9 for 12 h. Isoelectric focusing was performed in three stages of applied potential difference as follows: 250 V for 15 min, 10,000 V for 1 h, followed by 8000 V for up to 6 h, until 40,000 V-h were achieved. Focused strips were then soaked in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20% glycerol) containing 130 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min, followed by equilibration buffer containing 135 mm iodoacetamide for another 10 min. Strips were then applied to 10% acrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE, followed by transblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blot analysis using the striated muscle TM-specific CH1 antibody was conducted using a 1:5000 dilution. Binding of the primary antibody was detected by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) and enhanced by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Histological Analysis—Heart tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h. The hearts were dehydrated through a gradient of alcohols and xylene, followed by embedding in paraffin. Sections (5 μm) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Isolated Anterograde Perfused Heart Preparation—Control and transgenic mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg sodium nembutal and 1.5 units of heparin to prevent intracoronary microthrombi. The heart was rapidly excised, and the aorta was cannulated with a 20-gauge needle, followed by retrograde perfusion with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (mm): NaCl 118, CaCl2 2.5, KCl 4.7, MgSO4 1.2, KH2PO4 1.2, Na2EDTA 0.5, NaHCO3 25, and glucose 11. The buffer was equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, with a pH of 7.4, and maintained at 37.4 °C. A PE-50 catheter was inserted into the left atrium, advanced into the left ventricle, and forced through the ventricular apex. The proximal end of the catheter remained in the left ventricle, with the distal end connected to a pressure transducer. After the Langendorff mode retrograde perfusion was established, the pulmonary vein was opened and connected to the venous return cannula. Anterograde work-performing perfusion was initiated at a workload of 250 mm Hg ml/min, which was achieved with a venous return of 5 ml/min and aortic pressure of 50 mm Hg. Pressure loading was carried out in work-performing heart preparations. Venous return was kept constant at 5 ml/min, and afterload (aortic resistance) was increased to the point where the maximal rate of pressure development (+dP/dt) was not further elevated. Isoproterenol (Sigma) was added to the Krebs-Henseleit solution entering the heart using a microperfusion pump (MasterFlex L/S). The signals were digitized and analyzed by software “Biobench.” Heart rate, left ventricular pressure, and the mean coronary perfusion pressure were continuously monitored. The pressure curve was used to calculate the rate of pressure development (+dP/dt) and decline (–dP/dt), time to peak pressure (TPP), and time to half-relaxation (RT½). TPP and RT½ were normalized with respect to peak left ventricular pressure because they are dependent upon the extent of pressure development. Pressure loading was carried out at a venous return of 5 ml/min and maximum afterload values (mean aortic pressures) that can be generated at this venous return (preload). To test for a trend in the +dP/dt as an index of cardiac performance over the range of increasing afterloads, mean arterial pressures were gradually increased from 10 to 50 mm Hg with a custom-made micrometer at a constant preload of 5 ml/min. Starling curves were generated by linear regression using the software “Origin” (version 4.0, Microcal™ software). For the regression lines, the average slopes were calculated using only the initial part of the Frank-Starling curve (at cardiac work from 0 to 250 mm Hg ml/min). Data are presented as means ± S.E., and the statistical differences were estimated by paired and unpaired t test analyses when appropriate. Preparation of Skinned Fiber Bundles—The relation between stress (tension) and ATPase activity was measured simultaneously, over a range of pCa (–log of the molar free Ca2+) values, in detergent-extracted fiber bundles as described previously (6Wolska B. Keller R. Evans C. Palmiter K. Phillips R. Muthuchamy M. Oehlenschlager J. Wieczorek D.F. deTombe P. Solaro R.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Muthuchamy M. Pieples K. Rethinasamy P. Hoit B. Grupp I. Boivin G. Wolska B. Evans C. Solaro R.J. Wieczorek D.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The fiber bundles (150 –175 μm in diameter and 1.2 mm in length) were dissected from the left ventricular papillary muscle of the mice hearts and skinned overnight in a relaxing buffer containing (in mm) KCl 150, MOPS 20, EGTA 10, free Mg2+ 1, MgATP2– 5, creatine phosphate 12, dithiothreitol 0.5. The solution also contained 1% Triton X-100, creatine kinase 10 IU/ml, and protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Fiber bundles were mounted at one end to a rod and to a force transducer at the other end. Resting sarcomere length was set at 2.2 μm using a laser diffraction pattern. Cross-sectional area of the fiber bundles was computed using an elliptical model, and the measurements of fiber width and height were obtained. Tension was expressed as force/cross-sectional area. The ATPase activity of the fiber bundles was measured by a linked enzyme assay coupled to the breakdown of NADH as described previously (6Wolska B. Keller R. Evans C. Palmiter K. Phillips R. Muthuchamy M. Oehlenschlager J. Wieczorek D.F. deTombe P. Solaro R.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Tension and ATPase activity were determined over a range of pCa values generated by adding CaCl2 to the relaxing solution described above. Data were linearized using the Hill transformation and the pCa tension or pCa ATPase activity relations were fitted to the Hill equation using non-linear regression analysis to derive the pCa50 value and Hill coefficient (6Wolska B. Keller R. Evans C. Palmiter K. Phillips R. Muthuchamy M. Oehlenschlager J. Wieczorek D.F. deTombe P. Solaro R.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Generation of Chimeric α-/β-TM Transgenic Mice—To elucidate the relation between the carboxyl-terminal end amino acids of TM and contractile behavior in striated muscle, we developed a transgenic mouse model with an overexpressed chimeric α/β-TM protein in the heart. The chimeric TM cDNA was generated by joining the murine α-TM cDNA (containing amino acids 1–257) to the murine β-TM cDNA (containing amino acids 258 –284 and the entire 3′-UTR). This TM sequence was ligated at the 5′ end to the murine α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoter, which confers cardiac-specific expression (Fig. 1). An SV40 polyadenylation and termination cassette is located 3′ of the TM cDNA to ensure correct transcript processing. Founder mice were identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Six lines of transgenic mice were produced with copy numbers ranging from 2 to 5. Chimeric α-/β-TM Transcript and Protein Expression in the Transgenic Mice—We measured TM expression using Northern blot analysis following RNA isolation from hearts of TG and NTG littermates. RNA from each transgenic line was isolated and probed with 32P-radiolabeled 3′-UTR sequences from α-TM and β-TM cDNAs; these nucleotide regions are specific to the particular striated muscle isoform and do not cross-react with other striated muscle TM isoforms (4Pieples K. Wieczorek D.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8291-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, endogenous α-TM is expressed in all hearts and in the skeletal muscle control. When the β-TM 3′-UTR sequence is used as a probe, the expression of chimeric TM is seen to be restricted to transgenic heart samples; this probe also hybridizes to control skeletal muscle RNA, but it is not detected in NTG cardiac RNA. The expression levels of the endogenous α-TM transcript remain relatively constant in the various transgenic mouse lines. However, the α-/β-TM mRNA is expressed more variably, ranging from 93% in line 22 to 300% in line 14 of endogenous α-TM levels. This varied expression of the chimeric mRNA correlates with the copy numbers of the transgene in the different lines. GAPDH expression was ascertained to account for any loading differences among the various samples. To compare contractile protein profiles from chimeric α-/β-TM transgenic mice with controls, we isolated myofibrillar proteins from the hearts of these mice. These proteins were subject to SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize protein content (Fig. 3A). Results show there are no changes in the expression of cardiac contractile myofilament proteins between NTG and α-/β-TM transgenic mice. Also, quantification of total TM protein levels demonstrated no significant differences among the 6 transgenic lines nor between the TG and NTG mice. Under SDS-PAGE conditions, endogenous α-TM and the chimeric α-/β-TM isoforms are not separated electrophoretically, and their isoforms cannot be distinguished. To enhance the sensitivity of the SDS-PAGE assay, we conducted a Western blot analysis using a striated muscle TM-specific antibody (Fig. 3B). This antibody recognizes the three striated muscle TM isoforms with the same affinity (data not shown). However, we detected only one band in either the TG or NTG samples. Even though the chimeric α-/β-TM has one more negative charge than the wild-type α-TM, there are no apparent differences in protein mobility under these experimental conditions. There is a discrepancy between observing two TM messages (endogenous α-TM and chimeric α-/β-TM), yet only one striated muscle TM protein band is detected. To resolve this issue, we conducted additional analyses to define whether only a single TM protein was being translated or whether two TM proteins were co-migrating in the gel. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that addition of urea to SDS-PAGE gels facilitates separation of TM species, including the α-TM, β-TM, and TPM 3 striated muscle isoforms (4Pieples K. Wieczorek D.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8291-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When myofibrillar proteins were subject to SDS-PAGE containing 3.4 m urea, there is no enhanced resolution of TM species, even after Western blot analyses with a TM-specific antibody (data not shown). To identify the TM protein(s) produced in the transgenic mice, we conducted a mass spectrophotometric analysis on the isolated and purified TG TM sample from the SDS-PAGE gel. Results showed there is 100% amino acid sequence identity with wild-type α-TM for amino acids 1–257; the last 27 amino acids (amino acids 258 –284) were not resolvable. To ascertain the distribution of α-TM and chimeric α-/β-TM dimeric species in control and transgenic mice, myofibrillar proteins from NTG and TG hearts were subject to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting of the transfer membrane with the striated muscle TM antibody. A minor modification of the two-dimensional electrophoretic procedure of O'Farrell (14O'Farrell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was employed to resolve the different TM dimers and determine their subunit composition (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under reduced-reduced conditions, heart myofibrillar protein samples from NTG mice show a single area, labeled α, that is reactive with the TM antibody (Fig. 4). In agreement with previous studies on TM composition in skeletal and cardiac musculature, the results show the α–TM isoform is predominant in the heart. The results from Fig. 2 show that in the TG mice, both α- and chimeric α-/β-TM transcripts are generated in the hearts. When the TM protein subunit composition of TG hearts is examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, results show that the TM species resolve into α-and α-/β-subunits in TG samples under reduced-reduced conditions (Fig. 4). A PhosphorImager quantitative analysis shows that 51 ± 2.8% of the total cardiac TM content is the α-/β-TM chimeric protein in the TG hearts. Also the total TM protein levels are equivalent between TG and NTG hearts, which is in agreement with the results obtained from the Coomassie Blue staining analysis. These results demonstrate that both α-TM and chimeric α-/β-TM are present in the TG cardiac myofibrils. To negate the possibility that an unexpected mutation or deletion of the α-/β-TM DNA sequences occurred during transgenesis, we conducted PCR analyses on TG mouse tail DNA. By using oligonucleotides corresponding to the α-MHC and β-TM 3′-UTR sequences as 5′ and 3′ primers, a PCR fragment was generated, amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Results show there are no mutations or deletions in the α-/β-TM nucleotide sequence (or the corresponding amino acid sequence) in the transgene construct. Histological and Physiological Studies—None of the founder mice or their progeny demonstrates any gross phenotypic alterations or reduced viability. Over 15 transgenic mice from 3 different lines and ranging in age from 2 months to 11 months were examined for morphological changes. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained heart sections show no signs of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, thrombi, necrosis, or any other pathological condition in any of the TG lines examined (data not shown). Also, no differences in percent heart/body weight ratios from the transgenic to the NTG mice are observed. Thus, incorporation of the chimeric α-/β-TM protein into the cardiac myofibers does not lead to morphological or pathological alterations in the sarcomere. We pursued several lines of experiments to discover the physiological significance of the 27 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of striated muscle TM in the regulation of cardiac muscle contractility. Transgenic animals from line 14 were studied with different approaches, including the isolated-work performing heart. Mice from TG lines 25 and 31 were also examined to confirm the results. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of wild-type α-TM in transgenic mice does not lead to alterations in morphology or physiological performance of the heart (6Wolska B. Keller R. Evans C. Palmiter K. Phillips R. Muthuchamy M. Oehlenschlager J. Wieczorek D.F. deTombe P. Solaro R.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Prabhakar R. Boivin G.

An isolated anterograde perfused heart preparation was employed to carry out a functional analysis of the chimeric α-/β-TM hearts. This model allows a comparison of myocardial contractile parameters under identical base line conditions (50 mm Hg mean aortic pressure, venous return 5 ml/min, intrinsic heart rate of 320 – 400 beats/min, and cardiac minute work of 250 mm Hg ml/min), and without the compounding variables imposed by reflex changes in the intact animal. Under conditions of identical load, the TG hearts produce systolic pressures that are significantly lower than the control hearts (Table I). The maximal rate of pressure development for contraction (+dP/dt) is significantly decreased: 4504 ± 421 mm Hg/s in the controls versus 3137 ± 221 mm Hg/s (p < 0.05) in the TGs, along with an increased time to peak pressure (0.38 ± 0.026 ms/mm Hg versus 0.55 ± 0.039 ms/mm Hg for NTG versus TG, respectively) (Table I and Fig. 5). Coupled with the decreased contractility, the maximal rate of pressure decline (–dP/dt) is also decreased from 3668 ± 297 mm Hg/s in wild-type to 2768 ± 238 mm Hg/s in the TG heart. Additionally, there is an increase in the end diastolic pressure and in the heart rate in the chimeric α-/β-TM hearts, coupled with an increased basal coronary flow (3.14 ± 0.35 ml/min for NTG versus 4.34 ± 0.20 ml/min for TG). Other parameters of cardiac function (time to peak pressure – TPP and the half-time of relaxation – RT½) were derived from intraventricular pressure tracings. TPP is defined as the time between the beginning of systole and the peak development of pressure. RT½ is the time from the peak intraventricular pressure to the point of 50% ventricular relaxation. Both parameters were normalized with respect to peak intraventricular pressu"

https://openalex.org/W2011996632,"Recent studies suggest that the action of platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent phospholipid modulator of allergic and inflammatory reactions, is diverse and functions as a modulator of a variety of physiological and pathological events in many cell types and tissues. Its role (if any) in modulating the proliferation, transformation and/or differentiation of epithelial colonic cells, however, is not known. In this study, we showed that PAF is biologically active in epithelial-derived human colon carcinoma cells with different phenotypic properties. These cells expressed the PAF receptor. PAF activated three prominent mitogen-activated protein kinase modules (ERK, p38MAPK and Jun N-terminal kinases) in these cells, inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation (measured by the induction of Waf1/p21 and the induction of the differentiation-related marker CEA). The net effect of PAF treatment was the suppression of malignant cell behavior (measured by anchorage-independent growth and cellular invasion). It is concluded that PAF is a modulator of proliferation and differentiation in human epithelial-derived colon carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014180114,"Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) was identified as a bZIP protein that forms dimers with Jun proteins. JDP2 represses transcriptional activation of reporter constructs containing 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-responsive elements (TRE) or cyclic AMP responsive elements (CRE). JDP2, overexpressed by the avian retroviral vector RCAS, induces partial oncogenic transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts. JDP2-expressing cells form multilayered foci in monolayer cultures but do not show anchorage-independent growth. Both the carboxyl and the amino terminus of JDP2 are required for the transforming activity. Chimeric constructs of JDP2 carrying the leucine zipper domain of Fos, GCN4 or EB1 fail to transform CEF. The leucine zipper of Fos mediates only heterodimerization; it cannot homodimerize. In contrast, the leucine zippers of GCN4 and of EB1 exclusively homodimerize and do not form dimers with other bZip proteins. The results with the JDP2 chimeras suggest that the JDP2 homodimer and the JDP2/Jun heterodimer (or other bZip heterodimers formed with the Fos leucine zipper) are nontransforming, leaving as possible transforming combination the JDP2/Fos heterodimer. The unexpected transforming activity of a negative regulator of TRE- and CRE-dependent transcription raises an important question concerning the mechanisms of transformation by the related bZIP proteins Jun and Fos that address the same target sequences."

Differences in the frequency of allelic imbalance (loss of heterozygosity or amplification) at a number of loci were detected and these were evaluated through analysis of additional series of cancers using specific markers. The most consistent difference was observed at chromosome 20q13.1-13.3 characterized by a two fold difference between familial and nonfamilial disease in a total of 99 familial and 186 sporadic Finnish cases. This difference was not observed in a UK set of 67 familial and 96 sporadic CRCs. The genome-wide effort resulted in a large data set giving clues to the location of putative CRC predisposition genes in the genome. The approach provides an alternative strategy for detecting cancer predisposition genes solely reliant on the molecular analysis of single cases obviating the requirement to collect multiple samples from families."
