https://openalex.org/W2479496252,"Efficient intercellular transfer of RNAs, proteins, and lipids as protected exosomal cargo has been demonstrated in the CNS, but distinct physiologic and pathologic roles have not been well defined for this pathway. The capacity to isolate immunochemically human plasma neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs), containing neuron-specific cargo, has permitted characterization of CNS-derived exosomes in living humans. Constituents of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ)42-generating system now are examined in 2 distinct sets of human neural cells by quantification in astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) and NDEs, enriched separately from plasmas of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and matched cognitively normal controls. ADE levels of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1), γ-secretase, soluble Aβ42, soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP)β, sAPPα, glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), P-T181-tau, and P-S396-tau were significantly (3- to 20-fold) higher than levels in NDEs for patients and controls. BACE-1 levels also were a mean of 7-fold higher in ADEs than in NDEs from cultured rat type-specific neural cells. Levels of BACE-1 and sAPPβ were significantly higher and of GDNF significantly lower in ADEs of patients with AD than in those of controls, but not significantly different in patients with FTD than in controls. Abundant proteins of the Aβ42 peptide-generating system in ADEs may sustain levels in neurons. ADE cargo proteins may be useful for studies of mechanisms of cellular interactions and effects of BACE-1 inhibitors in AD.-Goetzl, E. J., Mustapic, M., Kapogiannis, D., Eitan, E., Lobach, I.

https://openalex.org/W2489412446,"In the dividing eukaryotic cell, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures that each daughter cell inherits an identical set of chromosomes. The SAC coordinates the correct attachment of sister chromatid kinetochores to the mitotic spindle with activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for initiating chromosome separation. In response to unattached kinetochores, the SAC generates the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which inhibits the APC/C and delays chromosome segregation. By cryo-electron microscopy, here we determine the near-atomic resolution structure of a human APC/C–MCC complex (APC/C(MCC)). Degron-like sequences of the MCC subunit BubR1 block degron recognition sites on Cdc20, the APC/C coactivator subunit responsible for substrate interactions. BubR1 also obstructs binding of the initiating E2 enzyme UbcH10 to repress APC/C ubiquitination activity. Conformational variability of the complex enables UbcH10 association, and structural analysis shows how the Cdc20 subunit intrinsic to the MCC (Cdc20(MCC)) is ubiquitinated, a process that results in APC/C reactivation when the SAC is silenced."
https://openalex.org/W1423495995,"Fundamental to quantitative characterization of the B cell receptor repertoire is clonal diversity - the number of distinct somatically recombined receptors present in the repertoire and their relative abundances, defining the search space available for immune response. This study synthesizes flow cytometry and immunosequencing to study memory and naive B cells from the peripheral blood of three adults. A combinatorial experimental design was employed, constituting a sample abundance probe robust to amplification stochasticity, a crucial quantitative advance over previous sequencing studies of diversity. These data are leveraged to interrogate repertoire diversity, motivating an extension of a canonical diversity model in ecology and corpus linguistics. Maximum likelihood diversity estimates are provided for memory and naive B cell repertoires. Both evince domination by rare clones and regimes of power law scaling in abundance. Memory clones have more disparate repertoire abundances than naive clones, and most naive clones undergo no proliferation prior to antigen recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2950445893,"Culture independent techniques, such as shotgun metagenomics and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing have dramatically changed the way we can examine microbial communities. Recently, changes in microbial community structure and dynamics have been associated with a growing list of human diseases. The identification and comparison of bacteria driving those changes requires the development of sound statistical tools, especially if microbial biomarkers are to be used in a clinical setting. We present mixMC, a novel multivariate data analysis framework for metagenomic biomarker discovery. mixMC accounts for the compositional nature of 16S data and enables detection of subtle differences when high inter-subject variability is present due to microbial sampling performed repeatedly on the same subjects, but in multiple habitats. Through data dimension reduction the multivariate methods provide insightful graphical visualisations to characterise each type of environment in a detailed manner. We applied mixMC to 16S microbiome studies focusing on multiple body sites in healthy individuals, compared our results with existing statistical tools and illustrated added value of using multivariate methodologies to fully characterise and compare microbial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2506081250,"2-Hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is an important epigenetic regulator, with potential roles in cancer and stem cell biology. The d-(R)-enantiomer (d-2-HG) is an oncometabolite generated from α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) by mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase, whereas l-(S)-2-HG is generated by lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase in response to hypoxia. Because acidic pH is a common feature of hypoxia, as well as tumor and stem cell microenvironments, we hypothesized that pH may regulate cellular 2-HG levels. Herein we report that cytosolic acidification under normoxia moderately elevated 2-HG in cells, and boosting endogenous substrate α-KG levels further stimulated this elevation. Studies with isolated lactate dehydrogenase-1 and malate dehydrogenase-2 revealed that generation of 2-HG by both enzymes was stimulated severalfold at acidic pH, relative to normal physiologic pH. In addition, acidic pH was found to inhibit the activity of the mitochondrial l-2-HG removal enzyme l-2-HG dehydrogenase and to stimulate the reverse reaction of isocitrate dehydrogenase (carboxylation of α-KG to isocitrate). Furthermore, because acidic pH is known to stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and 2-HG is a known inhibitor of HIF prolyl hydroxylases, we hypothesized that 2-HG may be required for acid-induced HIF stabilization. Accordingly, cells stably overexpressing l-2-HG dehydrogenase exhibited a blunted HIF response to acid. Together, these results suggest that acidosis is an important and previously overlooked regulator of 2-HG accumulation and other oncometabolic events, with implications for HIF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2514565647,"The Orion Bar is the archetypal edge-on molecular cloud surface illuminated by strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. Owing to the close distance to Orion (about 1,350 light-year), the effects of stellar feedback on the parental cloud can be studied in detail. Visible-light observations of the Bar(1) show that the transition between the hot ionised gas and the warm neutral atomic gas (the ionisation front) is spatially well separated from the transition from atomic to molecular gas (the dissociation front): about 15 arcseconds or 6,200 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun distance). Static equilibrium models(2,3) used to interpret previous far-infrared and radio observations of the neutral gas in the Bar(4,5,6) (typically at 10-20 arcsecond resolution) predict an inhomogeneous cloud structure consisting of dense clumps embedded in a lower density extended gas component. Here we report one-arcsecond-resolution millimetre-wave images that allow us to resolve the molecular cloud surface. In contrast to stationary model predictions(7,8,9), there is no appreciable offset between the peak of the H2 vibrational emission (delineating the H/H2 transition) and the edge of the observed CO and HCO+ emission. This implies that the H/H2 and C+/C/CO transition zones are very close. These observations reveal a fragmented ridge of high-density substructures, photoablative gas flows and instabilities at the molecular cloud surface. The results suggest that the cloud edge has been compressed by a high-pressure wave that currently moves into the molecular cloud. The images demonstrate that dynamical and nonequilibrium effects are important for the cloud evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2517406800,"This paper introduces an optimal sizing algorithm for a hybrid renewable energy system using smart grid load management application based on the available generation. This algorithm aims to maximize the system energy production and meet the load demand with minimum cost and highest reliability. This system is formed by photovoltaic array, wind turbines, storage batteries, and diesel generator as a backup source of energy. Demand profile shaping as one of the smart grid applications is introduced in this paper using load shifting-based load priority. Particle swarm optimization is used in this algorithm to determine the optimum size of the system components. The results obtained from this algorithm are compared with those from the iterative optimization technique to assess the adequacy of the proposed algorithm. The study in this paper is performed in some of the remote areas in Saudi Arabia and can be expanded to any similar regions around the world. Numerous valuable results are extracted from this study that could help researchers and decision makers."
https://openalex.org/W2513681033,"Accelerometers have been widely deployed in public health studies in recent years. While they collect high-resolution acceleration signals (e.g., 10-100 Hz), research has mainly focused on summarized metrics provided by accelerometers manufactures, such as the activity count (AC) by ActiGraph or Actical. Such measures do not have a publicly available formula, lack a straightforward interpretation, and can vary by software implementation or hardware type. To address these problems, we propose the physical activity index (AI), a new metric for summarizing raw tri-axial accelerometry data. We compared this metric with the AC and another recently proposed metric for raw data, Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO), against energy expenditure. The comparison was conducted using data from the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study, in which 194 women 60-91 years performed 9 lifestyle activities in the laboratory, wearing a tri-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) on the hip set to 30 Hz and an Oxycon portable calorimeter, to record both tri-axial acceleration time series (converted into AI, AC, and ENMO) and oxygen uptake during each activity (converted into metabolic equivalents (METs)) at the same time. Receiver operating characteristic analyses indicated that both AI and ENMO were more sensitive to moderate and vigorous physical activities than AC, while AI was more sensitive to sedentary and light activities than ENMO. AI had the highest coefficients of determination for METs (0.72) and was a better classifier of physical activity intensity than both AC (for all intensity levels) and ENMO (for sedentary and light intensity). The proposed AI provides a novel and transparent way to summarize densely sampled raw accelerometry data, and may serve as an alternative to AC. The AI's largely improved sensitivity on sedentary and light activities over AC and ENMO further demonstrate its advantage in studies with older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2478205319,"Post-translational protein modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins such as small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) regulates processes including protein homeostasis, the DNA damage response, and the cell cycle. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is modified by Ub or poly-Ub at lysine (Lys)164 after DNA damage to recruit repair factors. Yeast PCNA is modified by SUMO on Lys164 and Lys127 during S-phase to recruit the anti-recombinogenic helicase Srs2. Lys164 modification requires specialized E2/E3 enzyme pairs for SUMO or Ub conjugation. For SUMO, Lys164 modification is strictly dependent on the E3 ligase Siz1, suggesting the E3 alters E2 specificity to promote Lys164 modification. The structural basis for substrate interactions in activated E3/E2–Ub/Ubl complexes remains unclear. Here we report an engineered E2 protein and cross-linking strategies that trap an E3/E2–Ubl/substrate complex for structure determination, illustrating how an E3 can bypass E2 specificity to force-feed a substrate lysine into the E2 active site."
https://openalex.org/W2508318399,"Thrombospondin 1 and thrombospondin 2 (THBS1 and THBS2) share similar multifunctional domains, and are known to be antiangiogenic. However, the expression pattern of THBS1 and THBS2 is different, and the specific role of THBS2 in different subtypes of lung cancer remains largely unclear. To evaluate the significance of THBS1 and THBS2 in the development of lung cancer, the present study performed a microarray-based systematic-analysis to determine the transcript levels of thrombospondins and their relation to the prognosis in lung cancer. THBS1 was in general underexpressed in lung cancer; in contrast, mRNA levels of THBS2 were markedly overexpressed in a number of datasets of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), including lung adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma. Similar expression pattern of THBS1 and THBS2 was verified in pulmonary AC cell lines with real-time PCR analysis. The survival of lung AC patients with high THBS2 mRNA expression levels was poorer than patients with low levels of expression of THBS2. In a microarray-based analysis, genes coexpressed with THBS1 or THBS2 were determined. Pulmonary AC patients with a high expression level of sevenTSHB1-coexpressed genes (CCL5, CDH11, FYB, GZMK, LA-DQA1, PDE4DIP, and SELL) had better survival rates than those with a low expression level. Patients with a high expression of seven TSHB2-coexpressed genes (CHI3L1, COL5A2, COL11A1, FAP, MXRA5, THY1, and VCAN) had poor survival rates. Downregulation of VCAN and THBS2 with shRNA inhibited the cell proliferation in the A549 cell line. In summary, THBS1 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma. However, THBS2 may play a double-edged role in the progression of lung AC, i.e. anti-angiogenic and oncogenic function. Further study on the mechanism underlying the activity of THBS2 is warranted to have further implications for cancer diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary AC."
https://openalex.org/W2515032475,"The assessment of pressure pain threshold (PPT) provides a quantitative value related to the mechanical sensitivity to pain of deep structures. Although excellent reliability of PPT has been reported in numerous anatomical locations, its absolute and relative reliability in the lower back region remains to be determined. Because of the high prevalence of low back pain in the general population and because low back pain is one of the leading causes of disability in industrialized countries, assessing pressure pain thresholds over the low back is particularly of interest. The purpose of this study study was (1) to evaluate the intra- and inter- absolute and relative reliability of PPT within 14 locations covering the low back region of asymptomatic individuals and (2) to determine the number of trial required to ensure reliable PPT measurements. Fifteen asymptomatic subjects were included in this study. PPTs were assessed among 14 anatomical locations in the low back region over two sessions separated by one hour interval. For the two sessions, three PPT assessments were performed on each location. Reliability was assessed computing intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimum detectable change (MDC) for all possible combinations between trials and sessions. Bland-Altman plots were also generated to assess potential bias in the dataset. Relative reliability for both intra- and inter- session was almost perfect with ICC ranged from 0.85 to 0.99. With respect to the intra-session, no statistical difference was reported for ICCs and SEM regardless of the conducted comparisons between trials. Conversely, for inter-session, ICCs and SEM values were significantly larger when two consecutive PPT measurements were used for data analysis. No significant difference was observed for the comparison between two consecutive measurements and three measurements. Excellent relative and absolute reliabilities were reported for both intra- and inter-session. Reliable measurements can be equally achieved when using the mean of two or three consecutive PPT measurements, as usually proposed in the literature, or with only the first one. Although reliability was almost perfect regardless of the conducted comparison between PPT assessments, our results suggest using two consecutive measurements to obtain higher short term absolute reliability."
https://openalex.org/W2515847873,"Understanding and managing the biological invasion threats posed by aquatic plants under current and future climates is a growing challenge for biosecurity and land management agencies worldwide. Eichhornia crassipes is one of the world's worst aquatic weeds. Presently, it threatens aquatic ecosystems, and hinders the management and delivery of freshwater services in both developed and developing parts of the world. A niche model was fitted using CLIMEX, to estimate the potential distribution of E. crassipes under historical and future climate scenarios. Under two future greenhouse gas emission scenarios for 2080 simulated with three Global Climate Models, the area with a favourable temperature regime appears set to shift polewards. The greatest potential for future range expansion lies in Europe. Elsewhere in the northern hemisphere temperature gradients are too steep for significant geographical range expansion under the climate scenarios explored here. In the Southern Hemisphere, the southern range boundary for E. crassipes is set to expand southwards in Argentina, Australia and New Zealand; under current climate conditions it is already able to invade the southern limits of Africa. The opportunity exists to prevent its spread into the islands of Tasmania in Australia and the South Island of New Zealand, both of which depend upon hydroelectric facilities that would be threatened by the presence of E. crassipes. In Europe, efforts to slow or stop the spread of E. crassipes will face the challenge of limited internal biosecurity capacity. The modelling technique demonstrated here is the first application of niche modelling for an aquatic weed under historical and projected future climates. It provides biosecurity agencies with a spatial tool to foresee and manage the emerging invasion threats in a manner that can be included in the international standard for pest risk assessments. It should also support more detailed local and regional management."
https://openalex.org/W2514730124,"Keratin subtypes are selectively expressed depending on the cell type. They not only provide structural support, but regulate the metabolic processes and signaling pathways that control the growth of the epithelium. KRT17 (keratin 17) is induced in the regenerative epithelium and acts on diverse signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that KRT17 is invariably and permanently induced in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), as revealed by immunohistochemistry and cDNA microarray analysis. Two representative OSCC cell lines; KRT17-weakly expressing Ca9-22 and KRT17-highly expressing HSC3 were used to establish KRT17-overexpressing Ca9-22 and KRT17-knockdown HSC3 cells. Analysis of these cells revealed that KRT17 promoted cell proliferation and migration by stimulating the Akt/mTOR pathway. KRT17 also upregulated the expression of SLC2A1 (solute carrier family 2 member 1/Glut1) and glucose uptake. To further investigate the effect of KRT17 on tumorigenesis, KRT17-knockout HSC3 cells were established and were transplanted to the cephalic skin of nude mice. The tumors that developed from KRT17-knockout HSC3 cells had a lower Ki-67 labeling index and were significantly smaller compared to the controls. These results indicate that KRT17 stimulates the Akt/mTOR pathway and glucose uptake, thereby facilitating tumor growth. We could not confirm the relationship between KRT17 and SFN (stratifin) in the cells examined in this study. However, our study reinforces the concept that the cellular properties of cancer are regulated by a series of molecules similar to those found in wound healing. In OSCC, KRT17 acts as a pathogenic keratin that facilitates tumor growth through the stimulation of multiple signaling pathways, highlighting the importance of KRT17 as a multifunctional promoter of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2512540879,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor and poor prognosis for osteosarcoma patients is mainly due to chemotherapy resistance. MicroRNAs are important to maintain pathophysiological mechanisms of cancer and influence cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. In this study, we tested the functions of microRNA-21 for malignant features as well as for drug resistance of osteosarcoma. We used Northern blot to measure microRNA-21 levels in osteosarcoma-derived cell lines. MicroRNA-21 activity was modulated by either expressing a sponge to decrease its activity in an osteosarcoma-derived cell line expressing high levels of microRNA-21 or by introducing pri-microRNA-21 in a cell line with low endogenous levels. Cell migration was determined in a scratch assay and cell proliferation was measured by performing growth curve analysis. Sensitivity of the cells towards chemotherapeutics was investigated by performing cell viability assays and calculating the IC50 values. While cell migration was unaffected by modulated microRNA-21 levels, microRNA-21 inhibition slowed proliferation and exogenously expressed microRNA-21 promoted this process. Modulated microRNA-21 activity failed to effect sensitivity of osteosarcoma-derived cell lines to doxorubicin or methotrexate. Contrarily, reduction of microRNA-21 activity resulted in enhanced resistance towards cisplatin while ectopic expression of microRNA-21 showed the opposite effect. Increased microRNA-21 levels repressed the expression of Sprouty2 and ectopic expression of Sprouty2 was able to largely rescue the observed effects of microRNA-21 in osteosarcoma. In summary, our data indicate that in osteosarcoma microRNA-21 expression is an important component for regulation of cell proliferation and for determining sensitivity to cisplatin."
https://openalex.org/W2484084661,"As many as 10% of bone fractures heal poorly, and large bone defects resulting from trauma, tumor, or infection may not heal without surgical intervention. Activation of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) stimulates bone formation. Ticagrelor and dipyridamole inhibit platelet function by inhibiting P2Y12 receptors and platelet phosphodiesterase, respectively, but share the capacity to inhibit cellular uptake of adenosine and thereby increase extracellular adenosine levels. Because dipyridamole promotes bone regeneration by an A2AR-mediated mechanism we determined whether ticagrelor could regulate the cells involved in bone homeostasis and regeneration in a murine model and whether inhibition of P2Y12 or indirect A2AR activation via adenosine was involved. Ticagrelor, dipyridamole and the active metabolite of clopidogrel (CAM), an alternative P2Y12 antagonist, inhibited osteoclast differentiation and promoted osteoblast differentiation in vitro. A2AR blockade abrogated the effects of ticagrelor and dipyridamole on osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation whereas A2BR blockade abrogated the effects of CAM. Ticagrelor and CAM, when applied to a 3-dimentional printed resorbable calcium-triphosphate/hydroxyapatite scaffold implanted in a calvarial bone defect, promoted significantly more bone regeneration than the scaffold alone and as much bone regeneration as BMP-2, a growth factor currently used to promote bone regeneration. These results suggest novel approaches to targeting adenosine receptors in the promotion of bone regeneration.-Mediero, A., Wilder, T., Reddy, V. S. R., Cheng, Q., Tovar, N., Coelho, P.

https://openalex.org/W2507376363,"Reticulate evolution is characterized by occasional hybridization between two species, creating a network of closely related taxa below and at the species level. In the present research, we aimed to verify the hypothesis of the allopolyploid origin of hexaploid C. album s. str., identify its putative parents and estimate the frequency of allopolyploidization events. We sampled 122 individuals of the C. album aggregate, covering most of its distribution range in Eurasia. Our samples included putative progenitors of C. album s. str. of both ploidy levels, i.e. diploids (C. ficifolium, C. suecicum) and tetraploids (C. striatiforme, C. strictum). To fulfil these objectives, we analysed sequence variation in the nrDNA ITS region and the rpl32-trnL intergenic spacer of cpDNA and performed genomic in-situ hybridization (GISH). Our study confirms the allohexaploid origin of C. album s. str. Analysis of cpDNA revealed tetraploids as the maternal species. In most accessions of hexaploid C. album s. str., ITS sequences were completely or nearly completely homogenized towards the tetraploid maternal ribotype; a tetraploid species therefore served as one genome donor. GISH revealed a strong hybridization signal on the same eighteen chromosomes of C. album s. str. with both diploid species C. ficifolium and C. suecicum. The second genome donor was therefore a diploid species. Moreover, some individuals with completely unhomogenized ITS sequences were found. Thus, hexaploid individuals of C. album s. str. with ITS sequences homogenized to different degrees may represent hybrids of different ages. This proves the existence of at least two different allopolyploid lineages, indicating a polyphyletic origin of C. album s. str."
https://openalex.org/W2511869812,"Objective To describe disparities along the depression treatment cascade, from indication for antidepressant treatment to effective treatment, in HIV-infected individuals by gender and race/ethnicity. Methods The Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort includes 31,000 HIV-infected adults in routine clinical care at 8 sites. Individuals were included in the analysis if they had a depressive symptoms measure within one month of establishing HIV care at a CNICS site. Depressive symptoms were measured using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Indication for antidepressant treatment was defined as PHQ-9 ≥ 10 or a current antidepressant prescription. Antidepressant treatment was defined as a current antidepressant prescription. Evidence-based antidepressant treatment was considered treatment changes based on a person’s most recent PHQ-9, in accordance with clinical guidelines. We calculated the cumulative probability of moving through the depression treatment cascade within 24 months of entering CNICS HIV care. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations between gender, race/ethnicity, and a range of depression outcomes. Results In our cohort of HIV-infected adults in routine care, 47% had an indication for antidepressant treatment. Significant drop-offs along the depression treatment cascade were seen for the entire study sample. However, important disparities existed. Women were more likely to have an indication for antidepressant treatment (HR 1.54; 95% CI 1.34, 1.78), receive antidepressant treatment (HR 2.03; 95% CI 1.53, 2.69) and receive evidence-based antidepressant treatment (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.03, 2.74), even after accounting for race/ethnicity. Black non-Hispanics (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35, 0.65), Hispanics (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44, 0.89) and other race/ethnicities (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17, 0.73) were less likely to initiate antidepressant treatment, compared to white non-Hispanics. Conclusions In our cohort of HIV-infected adults depressive symptoms were common. Important disparities in the prevalence of depressive symptoms and receipt of antidepressant treatment existed by gender and race/ethnicity."
https://openalex.org/W2527055114,"The basal ganglia have a central role in motor patterning, habits, motivated behaviors, and cognition as well as in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. Receptors for histamine, especially the H3 receptor (H3R), are highly expressed in the striatum, the primary input nucleus of the basal ganglia, but their effects on this circuitry have been little explored. H3R interacts with dopamine (DA) receptors ex vivo; the nature and functional importance of these interactions in vivo remain obscure. We found H3R activation with the agonist R-(-)-α-methylhistamine to produce a unique time- and cell type-dependent profile of molecular signaling events in the striatum. H3 agonist treatment did not detectably alter extracellular DA levels or signaling through the cAMP/DARPP-32 signaling pathway in either D1- or D2-expressing striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). In D1-MSNs, H3 agonist treatment transiently activated MAPK signaling and phosphorylation of rpS6 and led to phosphorylation of GSK3β-Ser9, a novel effect. Consequences of H3 activation in D2-MSNs were completely different. MAPK signaling was unchanged, and GSK3β-Ser9 phosphorylation was reduced. At the behavioral level, two H3 agonists had no significant effect on locomotion or stereotypy, but they dramatically attenuated the locomotor activation produced by the D1 agonist SKF82958. H3 agonist co-administration blocked the activation of MAPK signaling and the phosphorylation of rpS6 produced by D1 activation in D1-MSNs, paralleling behavioral effects. In contrast, GSK3β-Ser9 phosphorylation was seen only after H3 agonist treatment, with no interactive effects. H3R signaling has been neglected in models of basal ganglia function and has implications for a range of pathophysiologies."
https://openalex.org/W2512294975,"Widespread afforestation programs sequester carbon from the atmosphere and mitigate the rising of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Meanwhile, afforestation carbon sequestration may cost soil water. However, changes in soil moisture content (SMC) after large-scale afforestation or reforestation have rarely been quantified. In this study, we measured changes in SMC following afforestation using a paired plots method with data from 757 plots in Northeastern China. We found a marginally significant decline in soil moisture content of the top 1-m soil (SMC0-1m) after afforestation (P = 0.08) at the regional scale. The SMC responses to afforestation also vary across species. For example, significant SMC decrease are found for Populus spp. plantations (P < 0.05) and plantations of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (P < 0.05). Splitting the first meter of the soil profile into different depth intervals revealed that SMC declined significantly in shallow layers (0–30 cm) for Populus spp. and Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica. We also found that when SMC in the control exceeded a specific threshold, SMC for all five tree species considered tended to decrease, suggesting that the effects of afforestation on soil hydrology vary across different regions."
https://openalex.org/W2511662368,"Background X&Y chromosomal aneuploidies are among the most common human whole-chromosomal copy number changes, but the population-based incidence and prevalence in the child-bearing population is unclear. Methods This retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data leveraged a routine non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) using parental genotyping to estimate the population-based incidence of X&Y chromosome variations in this population referred for NIPT (generally due to advanced maternal age). Results From 141,916 women and 29,336 men, 119 X&Y chromosomal abnormalities (prevalence: 1 in 1,439) were identified. Maternal findings include: 43 cases of 45,X (40 mosaic); 30 cases of 47,XXX (12 mosaic); 3 cases of 46,XX uniparental disomy; 2 cases of 46,XY/46,XX; 23 cases of mosaicism of unknown type; 2 cases of 47,XX,i(X)(q10). Paternal findings include: 2 cases of 47,XXY (1 mosaic); 10 cases of 47,XYY (1 mosaic); 4 partial Y deletions. Conclusions Single chromosome aneuploidy was present in one of every 1,439 individuals considered in this study, showing 47,XXX; 47,XX,i(X)(q10); 47,XYY; 47,XXY, partial Y deletions, and a high level of mosaicism for 45,X. This expands significantly our understanding of X&Y chromosomal variations and fertility issues, and is critical for families and adults affected by these disorders. This current and extensive information on fertility will be beneficial for genetic counseling on prenatal diagnoses as well as for newly diagnosed postnatal cases."
https://openalex.org/W2498459056,"Caveolae are the primary route for internalization and transendothelial transport of macromolecules, such as insulin and albumin. Caveolae-mediated endocytosis is activated by Src-dependent caveolin-1 (Cav-1) phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of dynamin-2 and filamin A (FilA), which facilitate vesicle fission and trafficking, respectively. Here, we tested the role of RalA and phospholipase D (PLD) signaling in the regulation of caveolae-mediated endocytosis and trafficking. The addition of albumin to human lung microvascular endothelial cells induced the activation of RalA within minutes, and siRNA-mediated down-regulation of RalA abolished fluorescent BSA uptake. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that albumin induced the association between RalA, Cav-1, and FilA; however, RalA knockdown with siRNA did not affect FilA recruitment to Cav-1, suggesting that RalA was not required for FilA and Cav-1 complex formation. Rather, RalA probably facilitates caveolae-mediated endocytosis by activating downstream effectors. PLD2 was shown to be activated by RalA, and inhibition of PLD2 abolished Alexa-488-BSA uptake, indicating that phosphatidic acid (PA) generated by PLD2 may facilitate caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, using a PA biosensor, GFP-PASS, we observed that BSA induced an increase in PA co-localization with Cav-1-RFP, which could be blocked by a dominant negative PLD2 mutant. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy studies of Cav-1-RFP also showed that fusion of caveolae with the basal plasma membrane was dependent on PLD2 activity. Thus, our results suggest that the small GTPase RalA plays an important role in promoting invagination and trafficking of caveolae, not by potentiating the association between Cav-1 and FilA but by stimulating PLD2-mediated generation of phosphatidic acid. Caveolae are the primary route for internalization and transendothelial transport of macromolecules, such as insulin and albumin. Caveolae-mediated endocytosis is activated by Src-dependent caveolin-1 (Cav-1) phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of dynamin-2 and filamin A (FilA), which facilitate vesicle fission and trafficking, respectively. Here, we tested the role of RalA and phospholipase D (PLD) signaling in the regulation of caveolae-mediated endocytosis and trafficking. The addition of albumin to human lung microvascular endothelial cells induced the activation of RalA within minutes, and siRNA-mediated down-regulation of RalA abolished fluorescent BSA uptake. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that albumin induced the association between RalA, Cav-1, and FilA; however, RalA knockdown with siRNA did not affect FilA recruitment to Cav-1, suggesting that RalA was not required for FilA and Cav-1 complex formation. Rather, RalA probably facilitates caveolae-mediated endocytosis by activating downstream effectors. PLD2 was shown to be activated by RalA, and inhibition of PLD2 abolished Alexa-488-BSA uptake, indicating that phosphatidic acid (PA) generated by PLD2 may facilitate caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, using a PA biosensor, GFP-PASS, we observed that BSA induced an increase in PA co-localization with Cav-1-RFP, which could be blocked by a dominant negative PLD2 mutant. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy studies of Cav-1-RFP also showed that fusion of caveolae with the basal plasma membrane was dependent on PLD2 activity. Thus, our results suggest that the small GTPase RalA plays an important role in promoting invagination and trafficking of caveolae, not by potentiating the association between Cav-1 and FilA but by stimulating PLD2-mediated generation of phosphatidic acid.

Although the signaling mechanisms regulating the invagination and internalization (endocytosis) of caveolae have not been fully characterized, it was shown that Src-dependent phosphorylation of the large GTPase dynamin-2 (2Ahn S.

In addition to the large GTPase dynamin-2, which is required for fission of caveolae from the plasma membrane, several small GTPases detected in caveolin-enriched membrane fractions have been proposed to participate in caveolae-mediated transport. For example, Cdc42, a small GTPase of the Rho family, was detected in caveolae (9Gingras D. Gauthier F. Lamy S. Desrosiers R.R. Béliveau R. Localization of RhoA GTPase to endothelial caveolae-enriched membrane domains.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), where it is thought to control caveolae-mediated endocytosis by regulating actin polymerization and interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and intersectin, a scaffolding protein required for efficient fission and internalization of caveolae (10Hussain N.K.

Another small GTPase, Rab5, which is known to participate in endocytosis by regulating vesicle docking and fusion, directly binds to caveolin-1, and this interaction increases Rab5 activity (13Hagiwara M. Shirai Y. Nomura R. Sasaki M. Kobayashi K. Tadokoro T. Yamamoto Y. Caveolin-1 activates Rab5 and enhances endocytosis through direct interaction.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rab5 was shown to control the targeting of caveolae to early endosomes and to be essential for cholera toxin B accumulation in Golgi vesicles (14Pelkmans L. Bürli T. Zerial M. Helenius A. Caveolin-stabilized membrane domains as multifunctional transport and sorting devices in endocytic membrane traffic.Cell. 2004; 118: 767-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rab5 facilitates intracellular trafficking of caveolae. There is also evidence that other small GTPases, such as Ras (15Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Co-purification and direct interaction of Ras with caveolin, an integral membrane protein of caveolae microdomains.J. Biol.

Mineo C. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Polarized distribution of endogenous Rac1 and RhoA at the cell surface.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21430-21436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), localize to caveolin-enriched membrane microdomains; however, their function in caveolae-mediated endocytosis and trafficking has not yet been established. Here, we hypothesized that yet another small GTPase, RalA, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, also participates in the regulation of caveolae internalization and trafficking. RalA was previously shown to regulate receptor endocytosis, trafficking, and exocytosis as well as actin cytoskeletal dynamics (17Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. The small GTPase RalA targets filamin to induce filopodia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 18Hazelett C.C. Yeaman C. Sec5 and Exo84 mediate distinct aspects of RalA-dependent cell polarization.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e39602Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that agonist-dependent endocytosis of EGF, insulin, transferrin, and activin type II receptors depends on RalA-mediated activation of its effector RalBP1 (19Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. Small G protein Ral and its downstream molecules regulate endocytosis of EGF and insulin receptors.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Activated RalBP1 interacts with the clathrin assembly protein complex, which includes a number of endocytic proteins, such as Eps15, epsin, and Rab11-FIP2, as well as clathrin adaptor protein AP-2 (20Yamaguchi A. Urano T. Goi T. Feig L.A. An Eps homology (EH) domain protein that binds to the Ral-GTPase target, RalBP1.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31230-31234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Cullis D.N. Philip B. Baleja J.D. Feig L.A.

EH proteins: multivalent regulators of endocytosis (and other pathways).Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 41: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, RalBP1 activation is essential for assembly of the clathrin coat and clathrin-mediated endocytosis of various receptors. We have previously shown that actin-binding protein FilA is recruited to caveolae following activation of Src kinase and Src-dependent phosphorylation of caveolin-1 and that FilA is required for endocytosis of albumin and trafficking of caveolae (6Sverdlov M. Shinin V. Place A.T. Castellon M. Minshall R.D. Filamin A regulates caveolae internalization and trafficking in endothelial cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4531-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Another group demonstrated that FilA interacts with active RalA (17Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. The small GTPase RalA targets filamin to induce filopodia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this work, we sought to determine the functional significance of RalA recruitment and association with FilA and Cav-1 in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs). We observed RalA activation and recruitment to EC caveolae upon stimulation of albumin, perhaps the best studied macromolecular cargo of endothelial caveolae (24Dobrinskikh E. Okamura K. Kopp J.B. Doctor R.B. Blaine J. Human podocytes perform polarized, caveolae-dependent albumin endocytosis.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2014; 306: F941-F951Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and demonstrated that FilA is not required for RalA activation by albumin, but rather that it is essential for RalA association with caveolae. Furthermore, a significant decrease in caveolae-mediated internalization of albumin was detected in cells treated with RalA siRNA, suggesting that RalA activation is critical for efficient caveolae-mediated transport. Also, we observed that PLD2-mediated production of PA downstream of RalA was involved in the regulation of caveolae fusion and fission events, arguably by promoting changes in membrane curvature and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. HLMVECs (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) were cultured on dishes coated with 0.2% gelatin in EBM-2-MV growth medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FBS, l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. Filamin A mAb was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody was from BD Biosciences. Monoclonal antibodies for β-actin and RalA were from Sigma-Aldrich (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Normal mouse IgG was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX). Antibody for PLD1 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), and the antibody for PLD2 was provided by Drs. Nozawa and Banno (Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, Gifu, Japan). DAPI, Alexa-488 BSA, and all fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse and goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). n-Octyl glucoside was purchased from RPI (Mt. Prospect, IL). PLD1 inhibitor VU0359595 was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), and PLD2 inhibitor VU 0364739 was from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). GFP-tagged human RalA as well as constitutively active (RalAG23V) and dominant negative (RalAS28N) mutants were kindly provided by Dr. Ferguson (John P. Robarts Research Institute, London, Canada). RalA siRNA (ON-TARGET plus SMART pool) was from Dharmacon (Pittsburgh, PA), which included four on-target sequences: oligonucleotide 1, GGACUACGCUGCAAUUAGA; oligonucleotide 2, CAAAUAAGCCCAAGGGUCA; oligonucleotide 3, GAGGAAGUCCAGAUCGAUA; and oligonucleotide 4, GAAAUUCGAGCGAGAAAGA. Full-length Homo sapiens caveolin-1 was used as a template to generate C-terminal RFP-tagged caveolin-1 (Cav-1-RFP). HLMVECs were transfected with Cav-1 or RalA constructs alone or in combination with control, FilA siRNA, or RalA siRNA by nucleofection (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used for experiments 48–72 h after transfection. GFP-PASS lentiviral construct was added to HLMVECs transfected with Cav-1-RFP for 48 h. Cells were then starved and stimulated with BSA (30 mg/ml). Adenoviral constructs, vector control, and dominant negative mutants of hPLD1 K898R and mPLD2 K758R were generated at the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core (Iowa City, IA). Adenoviral constructs (5 plaque-forming units/cell) of vector control, hPLD1 K898R, or mPLD2 K758R mutant were added to HLMVECs grown to ∼80% confluence in EBM-2-MV growth medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FBS. After overnight culture, the virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh complete medium and treated with BSA (30 mg/ml). The RalA activation assay kit was purchased from Upstate (Temecula, CA) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HLMVECs were serum-deprived for 5 h and then incubated with 30 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C for 5, 10, or 30 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold TBS and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and protein inhibitor mixture. Lysates were precleared with glutathione-agarose and incubated with agarose-conjugated RalBP1 for 30 min at 4 °C. The amount of precipitated active RalA was estimated by densitometry analysis from Western blots. The time course for RalA activation was calculated from three independent experiments. Fractionation was conducted as described previously (25Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. A simplified method for the preparation of detergent-free lipid rafts.J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, two confluent 100-mm plates were washed and scraped into basal buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was suspended in 1 ml of basal buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were lysed by 40 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer followed by passage 10 times through a 27-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and large cell fragments. Supernatants were collected and mixed with an equal volume of 50% OptiPrep and overlaid with 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0% OptiPrep gradient in basal buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Gradients were centrifuged at 52,000 × g in SW55Ti rotor for 10 h at 4 °C. Twelve fractions were collected starting from the top of the gradient, and equal volume samples of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For stimulation studies, cells were starved for 3 h and then treated with BSA (30 mg/ml for 30 min). For Western blotting, cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 60 mm n-octyl glucoside, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture. All insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 45 min). For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with M-280 Dynabeads coated with sheep anti-mouse IgG (Dynal Biotech, LLC) preconjugated with monoclonal anti-filamin A or anti-FLAG antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed with an ECL Super Signal kit (Pierce), and then relative band intensities (densitometry) from scanned blots were determined using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). For uptake experiments, GFP construct, RalA cDNA constructs, and RalA siRNA were transfected into HLMVECs seeded on collagen-coated glass coverslips. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were serum-deprived for 2–3 h in basal medium and then treated with 0.1% 1-butanol, 2-butanol, or 200 nm PLD inhibitors for 1 h. After treatment, cells were incubated with Alexa-488-BSA or Alexa-555-BSA (50 μg/ml) in basal medium containing 0.1 mg/ml unlabeled BSA for 30 min at 37 °C and washed with acid wash buffer (pH 2.5) followed by Hanks' balanced salt solution to remove surface-bound BSA, fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with the nuclear marker DAPI (1 μg/ml). Uptake was quantified for 50 cells/sample. Each experiment was repeated three times. Alexa-488-BSA uptake was estimated from thresholded images using the ImageJ Particle Analysis module. For immunostaining, non-transfected cells or HLMVECs transfected with empty GFP vector (EV), RalA constructs, or RalA siRNA were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and incubated with caveolin-1 or RalA antibodies (1 μg/ml). Non-confocal DAPI images were acquired using mercury lamp excitation and a UV filter set. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with 488- and 543-nm excitation laser lines and pinhole set to achieve 1 Airy unit. HLMVECs transfected with Cav-1-RFP were infected with EV, hPLD1 K898R, or mPLD2 K758R mutants for 36 h and then starved for 3 h before stimulation with BSA (30 mg/ml). In some experiments, 200 nm PLD inhibitor was added into the system 1 h before BSA stimulation. Live cell TIRF images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with 561-nm excitation and a ×100/1.46 numeric aperture α-Plan-Fluor objective. Experiments were conducted at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a Pecon XL TIRF S incubator chamber. HLMVECs were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (5 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free medium with 2% fetal bovine serum for 18–24 h (26Parinandi N.L. Scribner W.M. Vepa S. Shi S. Natarajan V.

Cells were then washed in minimal essential medium and treated with thrombin (0.05 units/ml) for 30 min in the presence of 0.1% 1-butanol. Treatment was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of methanol-concentrated HCl (100:1, v/v). Cellular lipids were extracted, and [32P]PBt, an indicator of PLD activation in vivo (28Natarajan V. Vepa S. al-Hassani M. Scribner W.M. The enhancement by wortmannin of protein kinase C-dependent activation of phospholipase D in vascular endothelial cells.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1997; 86: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which was formed as a result of PLD-mediated trans-phosphatidylation, was separated by TLC in 1% potassium oxalate-impregnated silica gel H plates as described (28Natarajan V. Vepa S. al-Hassani M. Scribner W.M. The enhancement by wortmannin of protein kinase C-dependent activation of phospholipase D in vascular endothelial cells.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1997; 86: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the upper phase of ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/glacial acetic acid/water (65:10:15:50, v/v/v/v) was used as the developing solvent system. Unlabeled PBt was introduced as a carrier, the lipids were separated by TLC and visualized by autoradiography, and radioactivity of PBt was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Data generated were expressed as a percentage of control. Statistical comparisons were performed with GraphPad Prism5 using ANOVA with significance level set at p < 0.05; p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 were considered highly significant. To test whether RalA is activated upon the addition of albumin to stimulate caveolae-mediated endocytosis, we assessed RalA-GTP/RalBP1 binding. Starved HLMVECs were stimulated with 30 mg/ml BSA for 5, 10, or 30 min. Clarified lysates were incubated with a RalBP1 fragment, and the amount of co-precipitated GTP-bound RalA was analyzed by Western blotting. An increase in RalA activity was detected after 10 min and remained elevated through 30 min of BSA stimulation (Fig. 1A). Densitometry analysis of Western blots revealed a 35% enhancement in the amount of GTP-bound RalA in the presence of BSA (Fig. 1B), suggesting that RalA is activated during caveolae-mediated endocytosis of albumin. To investigate whether RalA is localized on caveolae, we examined RalA distribution in density gradient fractions of HLMVECs. The majority of endothelial RalA was localized to cholesterol-enriched fractions (fractions 2–4), which also contained Cav-1 and FilA (Fig. 2A). However, because centrifugation in the density gradient separates protein complexes and organelles based on the ratio of protein to lipid, RalA could be associated with lipid rafts and not necessarily caveolae. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis verified that in starved cells, RalA interacts with both Cav-1 and FilA (Fig. 2B), indicating that RalA may be associated with caveolae by directly binding to either FilA or Cav-1. Moreover, stimulation of caveolae-mediated endocytosis with 30 mg/ml BSA induced an increase in association between RalA, Cav-1, and FilA (Fig. 2B), implying that formation of the RalA·Cav-1·FilA complex occurs during caveolae-mediated endocytosis. To confirm that RalA associates with caveolae actively participating in albumin transport, we stimulated HLMVECs with Alexa-488-BSA and assessed RalA localization. RalA was concentrated at the plasma membrane and also in a vesicular pool that co-localized with the internalized BSA (Fig. 2C). Together with biochemical analysis of cholesterol-enriched membrane fractions and immunoprecipitation results, these data suggest that RalA is recruited to cargo-loaded caveolae. Increased RalA activity and association of RalA and Cav-1 in response to the addition of BSA raises the possibility that this interaction might be nucleotide-dependent. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HLMVECs with GFP-tagged WT RalA, constitutively active RalA mutant (RalA G23V), or dominant negative RalA mutant (RalA S28N) and assessed their interaction with Cav-1 by co-immunoprecipitation. Western blotting analysis confirmed equal expression of all RalA constructs (Fig. 3A), whereas immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged WT or mutant RalA constructs revealed that Cav-1 primarily associated with constitutively active GTP-bound RalA G23V mutant (Fig. 3B). Neither overexpressed WT RalA nor dominant negative RalA S28N mutant was found in the complex with Cav-1, implying that RalA activation is essential for its recruitment to caveolae. Because RalA interacts with Cav-1 in a GTP-dependent manner, we tested whether RalA activation is required for caveolae-mediated endocytosis. HLMVECs transfected with GFP-tagged RalA mutants were incubated with Alexa-555-BSA for 30 min, acid-washed to remove surface-bound albumin, and fixed. As shown in Fig. 4A, cells expressing constitutively active RalAG23V-GFP mutant accumulated internalized BSA in perinuclear regions, whereas in cells expressing dominant negative RalAS28N-GFP mutant, BSA accumulation was reduced and appeared as small vesicles evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A). Quantification of BSA uptake in GFP-positive cells revealed that dominant negative RalA mutant reduced caveolae-mediated endocytosis by ∼35% in comparison with cells transfected with empty vector or non-transfected (NTF) cells used as an internal control for each condition (Fig. 4B). Although overexpression of WT RalA or constitutively active RalA G23V mutant did not significantly increase BSA uptake, dominant negative RalA S28N mutant significantly reduced caveolae-mediated endocytosis, suggesting that endogenous RalA expression is not rate-limiting. To investigate the role of FilA in RalA activation and recruitment to caveolae following the addition of BSA, HLMVECs were transfected with control or FilA siRNA (6Sverdlov M. Shinin V. Place A.T. Castellon M. Minshall R.D. Filamin A regulates caveolae internalization and trafficking in endothelial cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4531-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Seventy-two h after transfection, cells were serum-deprived for 4 h, stimulated with 30 mg/ml BSA for 30 min, and lysed. RalA activation assay revealed that knockdown of FilA did not inhibit the increase in RalA GTP binding in response to BSA (Fig. 5A), implying that RalA binding to FilA is not required for RalA activation. However, when RalA was immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with FilA siRNA, we did not detect an increase in RalA/Cav-1 association in the presence of BSA (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that FilA may serve as a scaffold for RalA·Cav-1 complex formation and that FilA is required for recruitment of activated RalA to cargo-loaded caveolae. Having demonstrated that dominant negative RalA reduces the endocytosis of albumin, we next treated HLMVECs with RalA siRNA versus scrambled control siRNA for 48 h, serum-deprived the cells for 2–3 h, and either stimulated with 30 mg/ml BSA for 30 min and lysed or incubated with Alexa-488-BSA for 30 min, acid-washed, and fixed for confocal imaging. As shown in Fig. 5C, we tested the SMART POOL (SP) RalA siRNA mixture as well as each of the four oligonucleotides from the SMART POOL individually. RalA expression was reduced specifically with no effect on Cav-1 expression in HLMVECs.

However, the pathogenic potential of other Bcc species is yet unknown. To elucidate clinical relevance of Burkholderia contaminans, a species frequently isolated from CF respiratory samples in Ibero-American countries, we aimed to identify its key virulence factors possibly linked with an unfavorable clinical outcome. We performed a genome-wide comparative analysis of two isolates of B. contaminans ST872 from sputum and blood culture of a female CF patient in Argentina. RNA-seq data showed significant changes in expression for quorum sensing-regulated virulence factors and motility and chemotaxis. Furthermore, we detected expression changes in a recently described low-oxygen-activated (lxa) locus which encodes stress-related proteins, and for two clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of antifungal and hemolytic compounds pyrrolnitrin and occidiofungin. Based on phenotypic assays that confirmed changes in motility and in proteolytic, hemolytic and antifungal activities, we were able to distinguish two phenotypes of B. contaminans that coexisted in the host and entered her bloodstream. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the sputum and bloodstream isolates (each representing a distinct phenotype) differed by over 1,400 mutations as a result of a mismatch repair-deficient hypermutable state of the sputum isolate. The inferred lack of purifying selection against nonsynonymous mutations and the high rate of pseudogenization in the derived isolate indicated limited evolutionary pressure during evolution in the nutrient-rich, stable CF sputum environment. The present study is the first to examine the genomic and transcriptomic differences between longitudinal isolates of B. contaminans. Detected activity of a number of putative virulence factors implies a genuine pathogenic nature of this novel Bcc species."
https://openalex.org/W2492378617,"Nα-terminal arginylation (Nt-arginylation) of proteins is mediated by the Ate1 arginyltransferase (R-transferase), a component of the Arg/N-end rule pathway. This proteolytic system recognizes proteins containing N terminal degradation signals called N-degrons, polyubiquitylates these proteins, and thereby causes their degradation by the proteasome. The definitively identified (canonical) residues that are Nt-arginylated by R-transferase are N-terminal Asp, Glu and (oxidized) Cys. Over the last decade, several publications suggested (i) that Ate1 can also arginylate non-canonical N-terminal residues; (ii) that Ate1 is capable of arginylating not only alpha-amino groups of N-terminal residues but also gamma-carboxyl groups of internal (non-N-terminal) Asp and Glu; and (iii) that some isoforms of Ate1 are specific for substrates bearing N-terminal Cys residues. In the present study, we employed arrays of immobilized 11-residue peptides and pulse-chase assays to examine the substrate specificity of mouse R-transferase. We show that amino acid sequences immediately downstream of canonical (Nt-arginylatable) N-terminal residue of a substrate, particularly a residue at position 2, can affect the rate of Nt-arginylation by R-transferase and thereby the rate of degradation of a substrate protein. We also show that the four major isoforms of mouse R transferase have similar Nt-arginylation specificities in vitro, contrary to the claim about specificity of some Ate1 isoforms for N terminal Cys. In addition, we found no evidence for a significant activity of the Ate1 R-transferase toward previously invoked non-canonical N-terminal or internal amino acid residues. Together, our results raise technical concerns about earlier studies that invoked non-canonical arginylation specificities of Ate1."
https://openalex.org/W2508348958,"Background Segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) is a rare non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory vascular disorder varying widely in clinical course. The purpose of this study is to analyze detailing clinical and imaging manifestations over time in patients with SAM through a literature review and to suggest an optimal management strategy. Methods A retrospective review of eight consecutive patients diagnosed with SAM between January, 2000 and January, 2012 was conducted. All presented with acute-onset abdominal or flank pain. Clinical features, imaging studies, and laboratory findings served as grounds for diagnosis, having excluded more common conditions (ie, fibromuscular dysplasia, collagen vascular disorders, or arteritis). CT angiography was done initially and repeated periodically (Week 1, Month 3, then yearly). Treatment was conservative, utilizing endovascular intervention as warranted by CT diagnostics. In a related systematic review, all English literature from 1976 to 2015 was screened via the PubMed database, assessing patient demographics, affected arteries, clinical presentations, and treatment methods. Findings Ultimately, 25 arterial lesions identified in eight patients (median age, 62.8 years; range, 40–84 years) were monitored for a median period of 26 months (range, 15–57 months). At baseline, celiac axis (3/8, 37.5%), superior mesenteric (4/8, 50%), and common hepatic (2/8, 25%) arteries were involved, in addition to isolated lesions of right renal, splenic, right colic, middle colic, gastroduodenal, left gastric, right gastroepiploic, proper hepatic, right hepatic, and left hepatic arteries. Compared with prior publications, celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery were more commonly affected in cohort. Arterial dissections (n = 8), aneurysms (n = 5), stenoses or occlusions (n = 4), and a single pseudoaneurysm were documented. Despite careful conservative management, new splanchnic arterial lesions (n = 4) arose during follow-up. Considering the few available reports of new arterial lesions in the literature, newly developing pathology is a distinctive feature of our patients, four of whom eventually required endovascular interventions. Conclusions Careful clinical observation via periodic CT angiography is required in patients with SAM, checking for newly developing lesions. The natural history of SAM should be clarified in a larger patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2513100491,"Muropeptides are fragments of peptidoglycan that trigger innate immune responses by activating nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 1 and NOD2. Muropeptides from Gram-negative bacteria contain a meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP) residue in either a terminal or a non-terminal position. While the former ones are known to be recognized by NOD1, much less is known about recognition of muropeptides with non-terminal meso-DAP, which are most abundant moieties of Gram-negative peptidoglycans. Here, we developed a novel system to assess biological activity of muropeptides, based on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) of NOD1 and NOD2 genes in modified HEK293T cells. Using NOD1/NOD2 knockout and overexpression systems, as well as human monocytes and macrophages, we refine the current view of muropeptide recognition. We show that NOD2 can recognize different natural muropeptides containing a meso-DAP residue (preferably in a non-terminal position), provided they are present at micromolar concentrations. NOD2 accepts muropeptides with long and branched peptide chains and requires an intact N-acetylmuramyl residue. Muropeptides with non-terminal meso-DAP can activate NOD1 as well, but, in this case, probably require peptidase pre-processing to expose the meso-DAP residue. Depending on NOD1/NOD2 ratio in specific cell types, meso-DAP-containing muropeptides can be recognized either primarily via NOD2 (in monocytes) or via NOD1 (in monocyte-derived macrophages and HEK293T-derived cells). The dual NOD1/NOD2 agonism of meso-DAP-containing muropeptides should be taken into account when assessing cellular responses to muropeptides and designing muropeptide immunostimulants and vaccine adjuvants."
https://openalex.org/W2518440581,"We have previously shown that the RNA binding protein, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) plays a critical role in regulating the expression of CD40L in activated CD4 T cells. This is achieved mechanistically through message stabilization at late times of activation as well as by altered distribution of CD40L mRNA within distinct cellular compartments. PTBP1 has been implicated in many different processes, however whether PTBP1 plays a broader role in CD4 T cell activation is not known. To examine this question, experiments were designed to introduce shRNA into primary human CD4 T cells to achieve decreased, but not complete ablation of PTBP1 expression. Analyses of shPTB-expressing CD4 T cells revealed multiple processes including cell proliferation, activation-induced cell death and expression of activation markers and cytokines that were regulated in part by PTBP1 expression. Although there was an overall decrease in the steady-state level of several activation genes, only IL-2 and CD40L appeared to be regulated by PTBP1 at the level of RNA decay suggesting that PTBP1 is critical at different regulatory steps of expression that is gene-specific. Importantly, even though the IL-2 protein levels were reduced in cells with lowered PTBP1, the steady-state level of IL-2 mRNA was significantly higher in these cells suggesting a block at the translational level. Evaluation of T cell activation in shPTB-expressing T cells revealed that PTBP1 was linked primarily to the activation of the PLCγ1/ERK1/2 and the NF-κB pathways. Overall, our results reveal the importance of this critical RNA binding protein in multiple steps of T cell activation."

Our data show that, under physiologically relevant stimulation with 10 pm cholesystokinin, the luminal acid load that results from the exocytic fusion of zymogen granules is significantly blunted by HCO3− buffer in comparison with HEPES, and that this is blocked by the specific TMEM16A inhibitor T16inh-A01. Furthermore, in a model of acute pancreatitis, we observed substantive luminal acidification and provide evidence that ANO1/TMEM16A acts to attenuate this pH shift.

https://openalex.org/W2486278000,"Insulin and insulin-like growth factors I and II are closely related protein hormones. Their distinct evolution has resulted in different yet overlapping biological functions with insulin becoming a key regulator of metabolism, whereas insulin-like growth factors (IGF)-I/II are major growth factors. Insulin and IGFs cross-bind with different affinities to closely related insulin receptor isoforms A and B (IR-A and IR-B) and insulin-like growth factor type I receptor (IGF-1R). Identification of structural determinants in IGFs and insulin that trigger their specific signaling pathways is of increasing importance in designing receptor-specific analogs with potential therapeutic applications. Here, we developed a straightforward protocol for production of recombinant IGF-II and prepared six IGF-II analogs with IGF-I-like mutations. All modified molecules exhibit significantly reduced affinity toward IR-A, particularly the analogs with a Pro-Gln insertion in the C-domain. Moreover, one of the analogs has enhanced binding affinity for IGF-1R due to a synergistic effect of the Pro-Gln insertion and S29N point mutation. Consequently, this analog has almost a 10-fold higher IGF-1R/IR-A binding specificity in comparison with native IGF-II. The established IGF-II purification protocol allowed for cost-effective isotope labeling required for a detailed NMR structural characterization of IGF-II analogs that revealed a link between the altered binding behavior of selected analogs and conformational rearrangement of their C-domains."
https://openalex.org/W2507499714,"Parkinson’s disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the disease, an in vitro model is important. In the 1990s, we used the SV40 large T antigen to immortalize dopaminergic neurons derived from Embryonic Day 14 rat mesencephalon. We selected a clone for its high expression of dopaminergic neuron markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and we named it 1RB3AN27 (N27). Because the original N27 cell line has been passaged many times, the line has become a mixture of cell types with highly variable expression of TH. In the current study, we have performed multiple rounds of clonal cultures and have identified a dopaminergic cell clone expressing high levels of TH and the dopamine transporter (DAT). We have named this new clone N27-A. Nearly 100% of N27-A cells express TH, DAT and Tuj1. Western blots have confirmed that N27-A cells have three to four times the levels of TH and DAT compared to the previous mixed population in N27. Further analysis has shown that the new clone expresses the dopamine neuron transcription factors Nurr1, En1, FoxA2 and Pitx3. The N27-A cells express the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), but do not express dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DβH), the enzyme responsible for converting dopamine to norepinephrine. Functional analysis has shown that N27-A cells are more sensitive than N27 cells to neurotoxins taken up by the dopamine transporter such as 6-hydroxydopamine and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+). The DAT inhibitor nomifensine can block MPP+ induced toxicity. The non-selective toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide were similar in both cell lines. The N27-A cells show dopamine release under basal and depolarization conditions. We conclude that the new N27-A clone of the immortalized rat dopaminergic cell line N27 should provide an improved in vitro model for Parkinson’s disease research."
https://openalex.org/W2517358938,"Even though abundance of Hsp27 is the highest in skeletal muscle, the relationships between the expression of HspB1 (encoding Hsp27) and muscle characteristics are not fully understood. In this study, we have analysed the effect of Hsp27 inactivation on mouse development and phenotype. We generated a mouse strain devoid of Hsp27 protein by homologous recombination of the HspB1 gene. The HspB1-/- mouse was viable and fertile, showing neither apparent morphological nor anatomical alterations. We detected a gender dimorphism with marked effects in males, a lower body weight (P < 0.05) with no obvious changes in the growth rate, and a lower plasma lipids profile (cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides, 0.001 < P< 0.05). The muscle structure of the animals was examined by optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Not any differences in the characteristics of muscle fibres (contractile and metabolic type, shape, perimeter, cross-sectional area) were detected except a trend for a higher proportion of small fibres. Different myosin heavy chains electrophoretic profiles were observed in the HspB1-/- mouse especially the presence of an additional isoform. Electron microscopy revealed ultrastructural abnormalities in the myofibrillar structure of the HspB1-/- mouse mutant mice (e.g. destructured myofibrils and higher gaps between myofibrils) especially in the m. Soleus. Combined with our previous data, these findings suggest that Hsp27 could directly impact the organization of muscle cytoskeleton at the molecular and ultrastructural levels."
https://openalex.org/W2497667077,"NPM1 (nucleophosmin 1) is a nucleolar phosphoprotein that regulates many cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, proliferation, and genomic integrity. Although its role in proliferating cell types and tissues has been extensively investigated, little is known about its function in neurons and in the brain where it is highly expressed. We report that NPM1 protein expression is increased selectively in the striatum in both the R6/2 transgenic and 3-nitropropionic acid-injected mouse models of Huntington's disease. Examination of the effect of ectopic expression on cultured neurons revealed that increasing NPM1 is toxic to otherwise healthy cerebellar granule and cortical neurons. Toxicity is dependent on its cytoplasmic localization and oligomerization status. Forced retention of NPM1 in the nucleus, as well as inhibiting its ability to oligomerize, not only neutralizes NPM1 toxicity but also renders it protective against apoptosis. Although not blocked by pharmacological inhibition of the pro-apoptotic molecules, JNK, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, or caspases, toxicity is blocked by compounds targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), as well as by dominant-negative forms of CDK1 and CDK2 and the pan-CDK inhibitor, p21(Cip1/Waf1) Although induced in in vivo Huntington's disease models, NPM1 protein levels are unchanged in cultured cerebellar granule and cortical neurons induced to die by low potassium or homocysteic acid treatment, respectively. Moreover, and counterintuitively, knockdown of its expression or inhibition of endogenous NPM1 oligomerization in these cultured neurons is toxic. Taken together, our study suggests that although neurons need NPM1 for survival, an increase in its expression beyond physiological levels and its translocation to the cytoplasm leads to death through abortive cell cycle induction."
https://openalex.org/W2511585274,"Ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is implicated in several clinical conditions like lung transplantation, acute pulmonary embolism after thrombolytic therapy, re-expansion of collapsed lung from pneumothorax or pleural effusion, cardiopulmonary bypass and etc. Because mortality remains high despite advanced medical care, prevention and treatment are important clinical issues for IR-induced ALI. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a controversial role in ALI. We therefore conducted this study to determine the effects of anti-VEGF antibody in IR-induced ALI. In the current study, the IR-induced ALI was conducted in a rat model of isolated-perfused lung in situ in the chest. The animals were divided into the control, control + preconditioning anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab, 5mg/kg), IR, IR + preconditioning anti-VEGF antibody (1mg/kg), IR+ preconditioning anti-VEGF antibody (5mg/kg) and IR+ post-IR anti-VEGF antibody (5mg/kg) group. There were eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in each group. The IR caused significant pulmonary micro-vascular hyper-permeability, pulmonary edema, neutrophilic infiltration in lung tissues, increased tumor necrosis factor-α, and total protein concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. VEGF and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were increased in IR-induced ALI. Administration of preconditioning anti-VEGF antibody significantly suppressed the VEGF and ERK expressions and attenuated the IR-induced lung injury. This study demonstrates the important role of VEGF in early IR-induced ALI. The beneficial effects of preconditioning anti-VEGF antibody in IR-induced ALI include the attenuation of lung injury, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and neutrophilic infiltration into the lung tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2512673653,"Most of the studies about NH4+ stress mechanism simply address the effects of free NH4+, failing to recognize the changed nitrogen assimilation products. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of glutamate on root growth under high ammonium (NH4+) conditions in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Hydroponic experiments were conducted using two wheat cultivars, AK58 (NH4+-sensitive) and Xumai25 (NH4+-tolerant) with either 5 mM NH4+ nitrogen (AN) as stress treatment or 5 mM nitrate (NO3-) nitrogen as control. To evaluate the effects of NH4+-assimilation products on plant growth, 1 μM L-methionine sulfoximine (MSO) (an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase (GS)) and 1 mM glutamates (a primary N assimilation product) were added to the solutions, respectively. The AN significantly reduced plant biomass, total root length, surface area and root volume in both cultivars, but less effect was observed in Xumai25. The inhibition effects were alleviated by the application of MSO but strengthened by the application of glutamate. The AN increased the activities of GS, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in both cultivars, resulting in higher glutamate contents. However, its contents were decreased by the application of MSO. Compared to AK58, Xumai25 showed lower glutamate contents due to its higher activities of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT). With the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) contents decreasing in roots, the ratio of shoot to root in IAA was increased, and further increased by the application of glutamate, and reduced by the application of MSO, but the ratio was lower in Xumai25. Meanwhile, the total soluble sugar contents and its root to shoot ratio also showed similar trends. These results indicate that the NH4+-tolerant cultivar has a greater transamination ability to prevent glutamate over-accumulation to maintain higher IAA transport ability, and consequently promoted soluble sugar transport to roots, further maintaining root growth."

The results of these simulations demonstrate that both upper and lower price limits can cause a volatility spillover effect and a trading interference effect. The process of price discovery will be delayed if upper price limits are imposed on a stock market; however, this phenomenon does not occur when lower price limits are imposed."

Methods We used two waves of data from the Rotterdam Youth Monitor, a longitudinal study conducted in the Netherlands. The analysis sample consisted of 2,141 adolescents aged 12 to 14 years (mean age at baseline = 12.2 years, SD = 0.43). Physical activity (e.g., sports outside school), screen time (e.g., computer use), and early sexual intercourse initiation were assessed by means of self-report questionnaires. Logistic regression models were tested to assess the associations of physical activity behaviors and screen time (separately and simultaneously) with early sexual intercourse initiation, controlling for confounders (i.e., socio-demographics and substance use). Interaction effects with gender were tested to assess whether these associations differed significantly between boys and girls. Results The only physical activity behavior that was a significant predictor of early sexual intercourse initiation was sports club membership. Adolescent boys and girls who were members of a sports club) were more likely to have had early sex (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.33, 3.56. Significant gender interaction effects indicated that boys who watched TV ≥2 hours/day (OR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.08, 3.68) and girls who used the computer ≥2 hours/day (OR = 3.92; 95% CI = 1.76, 8.69) were also significantly more likely to have engaged in early sex. Conclusion These findings have implications for professionals in general pediatric healthcare, sexual health educators, policy makers, and parents, who should be aware of these possible prospective links between sports club membership, TV watching (for boys), and computer use (for girls), and early sexual intercourse initiation. However, continued research on determinants of adolescents’ early sexual initiation is needed to further contribute to the strategies for improving adolescents’ healthy sexual development and behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2508181471,"Dust storms are a common phenomenon in arid and semi-arid areas, and their impacts on both physical and human environments are of great interest. Number of studies have associated atmospheric PM pollution in urban environments with origin in natural soil/dust, but less evaluated the dust spatial patterns over a city. We aimed to analyze the spatial-temporal behavior of PM concentrations over the city of Beer Sheva, in southern Israel, where dust storms are quite frequent. PM data were recorded during the peak of each dust episode simultaneously in 23 predetermined fixed points around the city. Data were analyzed for both dust days and non-dust days (background). The database was constructed using Geographic Information System and includes distributions of PM that were derived using inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation. The results show that the daily averages of atmospheric PM10 concentrations during the background period are within a narrow range of 31 to 48 μg m-3 with low variations. During dust days however, the temporal variations are significant and can range from an hourly PM10 concentration of 100 μg m-3 to more than 1280 μg m-3 during strong storms. IDW analysis demonstrates that during the peak time of the storm the spatial variations in PM between locations in the city can reach 400 μg m-3. An analysis of site and storm contribution to total PM concentration revealed that higher concentrations are found in parts of the city that are proximal to dust sources. The results improve the understanding of the dynamics of natural PM and the dependence on wind direction. This may have implications for environmental and health outcomes."

We studied the current distribution of genetic diversity and population structure in H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum in Jordan and investigated whether it is correlated with either spatial or climatic variation inferred from publically available climate layers commonly used in conservation and ecogeographical studies. The genetic structure of 32 populations collected in 2012 was analyzed with 37 SSRs. Three distinct genetic clusters were identified. Populations were characterized by admixture and high allelic richness, and genetic diversity was concentrated in the northern part of the study area. Genetic structure, spatial location and climate were not correlated. This may point out a limitation in using large scale climatic data layers to predict genetic diversity, especially as it is applied to regional genetic resources collections in H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum."
https://openalex.org/W2514649752,"Francisella tularensis is the causative agent of the lethal disease tularemia. Despite decades of research, little is understood about why F. tularensis is so virulent. Bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are involved in various virulence processes, including protein secretion, host cell attachment, and intracellular survival. Many pathogenic bacteria require metals for intracellular survival and OMPs often play important roles in metal uptake. Previous studies identified three F. tularensis OMPs that play roles in iron acquisition. In this study, we examined two previously uncharacterized proteins, FTT0267 (named fmvA, for Francisella metal and virulence) and FTT0602c (fmvB), which are homologs of the previously studied F. tularensis iron acquisition genes and are predicted OMPs. To study the potential roles of FmvA and FmvB in metal acquisition and virulence, we first examined fmvA and fmvB expression following pulmonary infection of mice, finding that fmvB was upregulated up to 5-fold during F. tularensis infection of mice. Despite sequence homology to previously-characterized iron-acquisition genes, FmvA and FmvB do not appear to be involved iron uptake, as neither fmvA nor fmvB were upregulated in iron-limiting media and neither ΔfmvA nor ΔfmvB exhibited growth defects in iron limitation. However, when other metals were examined in this study, magnesium-limitation significantly induced fmvB expression, ΔfmvB was found to express significantly higher levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in magnesium-limiting medium, and increased numbers of surface protrusions were observed on ΔfmvB in magnesium-limiting medium, compared to wild-type F. tularensis grown in magnesium-limiting medium. RNA sequencing analysis of ΔfmvB revealed the potential mechanism for increased LPS expression, as LPS synthesis genes kdtA and wbtA were significantly upregulated in ΔfmvB, compared with wild-type F. tularensis. To provide further evidence for the potential role of FmvB in magnesium uptake, we demonstrated that FmvB was outer membrane-localized. Finally, ΔfmvB was found to be attenuated in mice and cytokine analyses revealed that ΔfmvB-infected mice produced lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-10, compared with mice infected with wild-type F. tularensis. Taken together, although the function of FmvA remains unknown, FmvB appears to play a role in magnesium uptake and F. tularensis virulence. These results may provide new insights into the importance of magnesium for intracellular pathogens."

Approximately 20% of surgically treated patients ultimately develop metastases during the follow-up period. Currently, the TNM system is the only available prognostic test. Therefore, the identification of new markers for CRC remains important. Thrombomodulin (TM), a glycoprotein, is involved in angiogenesis and has been linked to many malignant diseases. However, the function of TM in CRC remains unclear.A total of 170 patients with CRC participated in this study. TM expression was analyzed via immunohistochemistry. Univariate (Kaplan-Meier) analysis was used to analyze patient outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). TM expression was manipulated using shRNA or an overexpression system. Transwell migration assays, wound healing migration assays, and the xCELLigence biosensor system were used to detect cell proliferative and migratory capacities.TM expression in the tumor tissues significantly and positively correlated with the DFS and OS of non-metastatic patients with CRC (ps = 0.036 and 0.0218, respectively). Suppression of TM expression increased the proliferation and migration of DLD-1 cells. TM overexpression reduced the cells' proliferative and migratory capacities. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression was up-regulated following TM silencing. Furthermore, the association between the migration of colon cancer cells and the levels of TM and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (fibronectin, vimentin and ezrin) was confirmed in HT29 and DLD-1 cells.Our study demonstrates that patients with non-metastatic CRC display low TM expression in their tumors and exhibit reduced DFS and OS. The enhanced expression of mesenchymal markers and COX-2 may be involved in the mechanisms that underlie recurrence in patients with cancer displaying low TM expression."

This study aimed to determine incidence of age-, sex- and subtype-specific first-ever stroke (FES) in Vietnam.We conducted a hospital-based retrospective study, targeting all stroke cases hospitalized at a solo-provider hospital in our study site of Nha Trang from January 2009 to December 2011 with International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes I60-69. We calculated positive predictive values (PPVs) of each ICD-10-coded stroke by conducting a detailed case review of 190 randomly selected admissions with ICD-10 codes of I60-I69. These PPVs were then used to estimate annual incident stroke cases from the computerized database. National census data in 2009 was used as a denominator.2,693 eligible admissions were recorded during the study period. The crude annual incidence rate of total FES was 90.2 per 100,000 population (95% CI 81.1-100.2). The age-adjusted incidence of FES was 115.7 (95% CI 95.9-139.1) when adjusted to the WHO world populations. Importantly, age-adjusted intracerebral hemorrhage was as much as one third of total FES: 36.9 (95% CI 26.1-51.0).We found a considerable proportion of FES in Vietnam to be attributable to intracerebral hemorrhage, which is as high or exceeding levels seen in high-income countries. A high prevalence of improperly treated hypertension in Vietnam may underlie the high prevalence of intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke in this population."

We aimed to compare TB treatment outcomes in home-based and facility-based DOT under programmatic conditions in an urban setting with a high TB burden.A retrospective analysis of a cohort of adult TB patients (≥15 years) routinely notified between 2010 and 2013 in two representative TB sub-districts in the Temeke district, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We assessed differences in treatment outcomes by calculating Risk Ratios (RRs). We used logistic regression to assess the association between DOT and treatment outcomes.Data of 4,835 adult TB patients were analyzed, with a median age of 35 years, 2,943 (60.9%) were men and TB/HIV co-infection prevalence of 39.9%. A total of 3,593 (74.3%) patients were treated under home-based DOT. Patients on home-based DOT were more likely to die compared to patients on facility-based DOT (RR 2.04, 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI]: 1.52-2.73), and more likely to complete TB treatment (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06-1.23), but less likely to have a successful treatment outcome (RR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92-0.97). Home-based DOT was preferred by women (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 1.55, 95% CI: 1.34-1.80, p<0.001), older people (aOR 1.01 for each year increase, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02, p = 0.001) and patients with extra-pulmonary TB (aOR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.16-1.81, p = 0.001), but less frequently by patients on a retreatment regimen (aOR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.08-0.19, p<0.001).TB patients under home-based DOT had more frequently risk factors of death such as older age, HIV infection and sputum smear-negative TB, and had higher mortality compared to patients under facility-based DOT. Further operational research is needed to monitor the implementation of DOT under programmatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2518057236,"Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) are key regulators of mesenchymal cells in vertebrate development. To what extent PDGFs also exert beneficial homeostatic or reparative roles in adult organs, as opposed to adverse fibrogenic responses in pathology, are unclear. PDGF signaling plays critical roles during heart development, during which forced overexpression of PDGFs induces detrimental cardiac fibrosis; other studies have implicated PDGF signaling in post-infarct myocardial repair. Different PDGFs may exert different effects mediated through the two PDGF receptors (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ) in different cell types. Here, we assessed responses induced by five known PDGF isoforms in the adult mouse heart in the context of adenovirus vector-mediated inflammation. Our results show that different PDGFs have different, in some cases even opposing, effects. Strikingly, whereas the major PDGFRα agonists (PDGF-A and -C) decreased the amount of scar tissue and increased the numbers of PDGFRα-positive fibroblasts, PDGFRβ agonists either induced large scars with extensive inflammation (PDGF-B) or dampened the adenovirus-induced inflammation and produced a small and dense scar (PDGF-D). These results provide evidence for PDGF isoform-specific inflammation-modulating functions that may have therapeutic implications. They also illustrate a surprising complexity in the PDGF-mediated pathophysiological responses."
https://openalex.org/W2512379215,"Dictyostelium discoideum is a widely used model to study molecular mechanisms controlling cell adhesion, cell spreading on a surface, and phagocytosis. In this study we isolated and characterize a new mutant created by insertion of a mutagenic vector in the heretofore uncharacterized spdA gene. SpdA-ins mutant cells produce an altered, slightly shortened version of the SpdA protein. They spread more efficiently than WT cells when allowed to adhere to a glass substrate, and phagocytose particles more efficiently. On the contrary, a functional spdA knockout mutant where a large segment of the gene was deleted phagocytosed less efficiently and spread less efficiently on a substrate. These phenotypes were highly dependent on the cellular density, and were most visible at high cell densities, where secreted quorum-sensing factors inhibiting cell motility, spreading and phagocytosis are most active. These results identify the involvement of SpdA in the control of cell spreading and phagocytosis. The underlying molecular mechanisms, as well as the exact link between SpdA and cell spreading, remain to be established."
https://openalex.org/W2510722883,"Under uncertainty, human and animal collectives often respond stochastically to events they encounter. Human or animal individuals behave depending on others’ actions, and sometimes follow choices that are sub-optimal for individuals. Such mimetic behaviors are enhanced during emergencies, creating collective behavior of a group. A stock market that is about to crash, as markets did immediately after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, provides illustrative examples of such behaviors. We provide empirical evidence proving the existence of collective behavior among stock market participants in emergent situations. We investigated the resolution of extreme supply-and-demand order imbalances by increased balancing counter orders: buy and sell orders for excess supply and demand respectively, during times of price adjustment, so-called special quotes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Counter orders increase positively depending on the quantity of revealed counter orders: the accumulated orders in the book until then. Statistics of the coming counter order are well described using a logistic regression model with the ratio of revealed orders until then to the finally revealed orders as the explanatory variable. Results given here show that the market participants make Bayesian estimations of optimal choices to ascertain whether to order using information about orders of other participants."
https://openalex.org/W2510970383,"Stumps account for a large proportion of coarse woody debris in managed forests, but their decay dynamics are poorly understood. The loss of mass and the degree of humification of the above-ground woody debris, below-ground woody debris, bark and root system (R1, 10 mm ≥ diameter > 0 mm; R2, 25 mm ≥ diameter >10 mm; 100 mm ≥ R3 > 25 mm; R4 > 100 mm) of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) stump systems were evaluated in southwestern China in a chronosequence of plantations cut 1–15 years prior to the study. The results indicated that above-ground woody debris decomposed more quickly than below-ground woody debris and bark, whereas the degree of humification followed the opposite trend. Compared with one-year stumps, the mass losses of 15-year stump systems were 60.4% for above-ground woody debris, 42.1% for below-ground woody debris, 47.3% for bark, 69.9% for R1, 47.3% for R2, 51.0% for R3, and 83.2% for R4. In contrast, below-ground woody debris showed a greater degree of humification compared with other components in the stump system. Among the root system, fine roots (R1, diameter ≤ 10 mm) had the largest k value (0.09), whereas the decay rate of coarser roots (R2, R3, R4; diameter > 10 mm) increased with increasing root diameter. However, coarse roots showed a larger degree of humification (0.2–0.6) than fine roots (0.3–0.4). These results suggest that below-ground woody debris and coarse roots may display a higher degree of humification, showing greater short-term contributions to overall humification when compared with the other components in the stump system."
