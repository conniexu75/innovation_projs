https://openalex.org/W2051556659,Genetic code expansion for synthesis of proteins containing noncanonical amino acids is a rapidly growing field in synthetic biology. Creating optimal orthogonal translation systems will require re-engineering central components of the protein synthesis machinery on the basis of a solid mechanistic biochemical understanding of the synthetic process.
https://openalex.org/W2070730177,"The anaerobic acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium woodii has a novel Na+-translocating electron transport chain that couples electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to NAD+ with the generation of a primary electrochemical Na+ potential across its cytoplasmic membrane. In previous assays in which Ti3+ was used to reduce ferredoxin, Na+ transport was observed, but not a Na+ dependence of the electron transfer reaction. Here, we describe a new biological reduction system for ferredoxin in which ferredoxin is reduced with CO, catalyzed by the purified acetyl-CoA synthase/CO dehydrogenase from A. woodii. Using CO-reduced ferredoxin, NAD+ reduction was highly specific and strictly dependent on ferredoxin and occurred at a rate of 50 milliunits/mg of protein. Most important, this assay revealed for the first time a strict Na+ dependence of this electron transfer reaction. The Km was 0.2 mm. Na+ could be partly substituted by Li+. Na+ dependence was observed at neutral and acidic pH values, indicating the exclusive use of Na+ as a coupling ion. Electron transport from reduced ferredoxin to NAD+ was coupled to electrogenic Na+ transport, indicating the generation of Δμ̃Na+. Vice versa, endergonic ferredoxin reduction with NADH as reductant was possible, but only in the presence of Δμ̃Na+, and was accompanied by Na+ efflux out of the vesicles. This is consistent with the hypothesis that Rnf also catalyzes ferredoxin reduction at the expense of an electrochemical Na+ gradient.

https://openalex.org/W2018491677,"p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)-derived soluble protein, ameliorates intestinal injury and colitis, reduces apoptosis, and preserves barrier function by transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in intestinal epithelial cells. The aim of this study is to determine the mechanisms by which p40 transactivates the EGFR in intestinal epithelial cells. Here we show that p40-conditioned medium activates EGFR in young adult mouse colon epithelial cells and human colonic epithelial cell line, T84 cells. p40 up-regulates a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17) catalytic activity, and broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitors block EGFR transactivation by p40 in these two cell lines. In ADAM17-deficient mouse colonic epithelial (ADAM17(-/-) MCE) cells, p40 transactivation of EGFR is blocked, but can be rescued by re-expression with WT ADAM17. Furthermore, p40 stimulates release of heparin binding (HB)-EGF, but not transforming growth factor (TGF)α or amphiregulin, in young adult mouse colon cells and ADAM17(-/-) MCE cells overexpressing WT ADAM17. Knockdown of HB-EGF expression by siRNA suppresses p40 effects on transactivating EGFR and Akt, preventing apoptosis, and preserving tight junction function. The effects of p40 on HB-EGF release and ADAM17 activation in vivo are examined after administration of p40-containing pectin/zein hydrogel beads to mice. p40 stimulates ADAM17 activity and EGFR activation in colonic epithelial cells and increases HB-EGF levels in blood from WT mice, but not from mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific ADAM17 deletion. Thus, these data define a mechanism of a probiotic-derived soluble protein in modulating intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis through ADAM17-mediated HB-EGF release, leading to transactivation of EGFR."

Recently, we demonstrated that a flavanone 2-hydroxylase (ZmF2H1, CYP93G5) converts flavanones to the corresponding 2-hydroxy derivatives, which are expected to serve as substrates for C-glycosylation. Here, we isolated a cDNA encoding a UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT708A6), and its activity was characterized by in vitro and in vivo bioconversion assays. In vitro assays using 2-hydroxyflavanones as substrates and in vivo activity assays in yeast co-expressing ZmF2H1 and UGT708A6 show the formation of the flavones C-glycosides. UGT708A6 can also O-glycosylate flavanones in bioconversion assays in Escherichia coli as well as by in vitro assays with the purified recombinant protein.

Glycosyltransferases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a sugar moiety to an acceptor molecule.

This family contains most plant UGTs, which utilize different small molecules derived from specialized metabolisms as acceptors, such as terpenoids, flavonoids, saponins, plant hormones, and xenobiotics (2.Caputi L.

Thus, plant UGTs are involved in different cellular processes that include specialized metabolism, modification of plant hormones, detoxification of xenobiotics, and plant-pathogen interactions. The glycosylation of specialized metabolites, such as flavonoids, affect their properties, enhancing their stability and solubility, and are believed to be important for the compartmentalization, storage, and biological activity of many specialized metabolites (3.Bowles D.

Flavonoids are classified in six major subgroups, chalcones, flavones, flavonols, flavandiols, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins, and a few species also produce aurones, isoflavonoids, 3-deoxyanthocyanins, and phlobaphenes (9.Falcone Ferreyra M.L.

In general, plants accumulate flavonoids in vacuoles as O-glycoside derivates; however, bryophytes, ferns, gymnosperms, and several angiosperms also produce flavonoid C-glycosides (10.Brazier-Hicks M.

In particular, cereals like wheat, rice, and maize mainly accumulate C-glycosyl flavones that are involved in protection against UV-B radiation and defense against pathogens (12.Casati P. Walbot V.

From another perspective, there is an increasing interest for C-glycosyl flavones because of their benefits for human health and their possible applications in the prevention of diverse diseases (19.El-Alfy T.S.

For example, C-glycosyl flavones inhibit pancreatic lipases, allowing their applications as chemopreventive compounds against obesity (21.Lee E.M. Lee S.S. Chung B.Y. Cho J.Y. Lee I.C. Ahn S.R.

Although the early metabolic steps resulting in flavanone formation and the branching point for the formation of different classes of flavonoids are well characterized in plants (24.Grotewold E. The genetics and biochemistry of floral pigments.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 761-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), the genes involved in the biosynthesis of glycosyl flavones in maize have not yet been fully identified (16.McMullen M.D. Kross H.

We have previously demonstrated that a flavanone 2-hydroxylase (ZmF2H1), CYP93G5, converts flavanones into the corresponding 2-hydroxyflavanones (25.Morohashi K. Casas M.I. Falcone Ferreyra M.L.

However, the specific enzyme responsible for C-glycosylating 2-hydroxyflavanones in maize remains unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify a C-glycosyltransferase involved in the formation of C-glycosyl flavones in maize. Here, we show that UGT708A6 is a C-glycosyltransferase that can catalyze the addition of a glucose molecule to 2-hydroxyflavanones, generating C-glycosyl flavones. Surprisingly, UGT708A6 can also accept flavanones as substrates to form O-glycosidated products. These dual activities were confirmed by both in vivo bioconversion assays and in vitro assays with the recombinant protein, revealing that UGT708A6 is a bifunctional enzyme with the ability to form both C-glycoside and O-glycoside derivatives using as acceptors 2-hydroxyflavanones and flavanones, respectively. B73 seeds were obtained from the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria (Pergamino, Buenos Aires, Argentina). Maize plants were grown in greenhouse conditions with supplemental visible lighting to 1000 microeinstein m−2 s−1 with 15 h of light and 9 h of dark. Samples were collected from hypocotyls, radicles (3-day-old plants), anthers, roots (21-day-old plants), seedlings (7-day-old plants), and juvenile leaves (21-day-old plants). Flavonoid standards and UDP-glucose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Indofine Chemical Co. (New Orleans, LA). A full-length cDNA corresponding to GRMZM2G162783 (UGT708A6) was amplified by PCR using the primers UGT708A6-NdeI-forward and UGT708A6-Not-reverse harboring the NdeI and NotI restriction sites, respectively, for further cloning. PCRs were performed with GoTaq (Promega) and Pfu polymerases (Invitrogen) (10:1) using 1× buffer, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm each primer, 0.5 mm each dNTP, 0.5 unit of enzyme, and cDNA from B73 leaves in a 25-μl final volume under the following cycling conditions: 2-min denaturation at 94 °C and 35 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 120 s followed by 7 min at 72 °C. Primers for cDNA were designed based on the sequence provided by the maize genome sequence (MaizeSequence, release 5b.60, GRMZM2G162783). The PCR product was purified from the gel, cloned in pGEMT-easy vector (Promega), and sequenced. The pGEMT-UGT708A6 construct was digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes NdeI and NotI, and the insert was purified and cloned in pET28a vector generating the construct pET28-UGT708A6. Full-length cDNAs corresponding to GRMZM2G162755 (UGT708A5), GRMZM2G063550 (UGT707A8), and GRMZM2G180283 (UGT91L1) were obtained from Arizona Genomics Institute (Tucson, AZ). ZmUGTs were amplified from the bacterial artificial chromosome clones by PCR using the primers described in supplemental Table 1 for further cloning in pET28 vector. PCRs were performed as described above for UGT708A6. The PCR products were purified from the gels, digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes, purified, cloned into pET28 vector, and sequenced. BL21(DE3) cells with the chaperone expression plasmid pGRO (28.Peirú S. Menzella H.G. Rodríguez E. Carney J. Gramajo H. Production of the potent antibacterial polyketide erythromycin C in Escherichia coli.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were transformed with the construct pET28-ZmUGTs and the empty vector pET28. Cell cultures (200 ml of LB medium containing 30 mg liter−1 kanamycin and 35 mg liter−1 chloramphenicol) were grown at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.4, and l-arabinose (2 mg ml−1) was added to induce chaperone proteins. The cultures were grown at 37 °C to midlog phase (A600 0.5–0.6), and recombinant N-terminal His6-ZmUGTs expression was achieved by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 20 h at 22 °C. For the purification of UGT708A6, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol) containing 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were disrupted by sonication and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain soluble cell extracts. The protein was bound to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Invitrogen) by rocking at 4 °C for 1 h, and then the resin was loaded onto a column, washed three times with 15 volumes of binding buffer followed by three washes with 7 volumes of washing buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 40 mm imidazole). Elution was carried out by five sequential additions of 1 ml of elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 200 mm imidazole). Finally, the recombinant protein was desalted in desalting buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) by four cycles of concentration and dilution using Amicon Ultra-15 30,000 (Millipore) and stored at −80 °C. The protein level was estimated both by comparison with dilution series of bovine serum albumin on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel and by using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad; Ref. 29.Bradford M.M.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). The yield of 90% pure recombinant protein obtained in these conditions was 6 mg liter−1 of culture. To express each ZmUGT in yeast, the full-length cDNAs were amplified by PCR using primers harboring restriction sites (supplemental Table 1) and each pET28-ZmUGT construct as templates. The PCR product was purified, digested with the corresponding enzymes, and cloned in p5AX43 vector generating the plasmids p5AX43-ZmUGTs: p5AX43-UGT708A5, p5AX43-UGT707A8, p5AX43-UGT91L1, and p5AX43-UGT708A6. The p5AX43 vector corresponds to a modified version of plasmid YEplac181 (30.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. New yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors constructed with in vitro mutagenized yeast genes lacking six-base pair restriction sites.Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar) in which the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter was inserted at the HindIII site.

Woods R.A. Transformation of yeast by lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). Yeast colonies harboring the plasmids were selected by growth on synthetic complete medium (SC) agar plates lacking uracil, tryptophan, and leucine (SC Ura− Trp− Leu−). For in vivo yeast activity assays, an individual recombinant yeast colony was grown for 40 h at 30 °C in 5 ml of liquid SC Ura− Trp− Leu− medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose. Then an aliquot of this culture corresponding to an A600 of 1.0 was collected by centrifugation, washed in sterile water, and used to seed 5 ml of induction medium, SC Ura− Trp− Leu− containing 2% (w/v) galactose and 3% (v/v) glycerol. The flavonoid substrates were then added to a final concentration of 40 μg ml−1. After incubation for 48 h at 30 °C, flavonoids were extracted with ethyl acetate from 1-ml culture aliquots by adding 500 μl of ethyl acetate and vortexing for 1 min. Solvent layers were separated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min, and flavonoids (both the aglycones and the glycosides) were recuperated in the organic layer. The organic layer was then twice re-extracted with 500 μl of ethyl acetate, and the organic layers were combined. The organic phase was dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in methanol for subsequent liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. For in vivo E. coli activity assays, BL21(DE3) cells harboring pGRO (for expression of GroEL-GroES chaperone complex) and pET28-ZmUGTs or empty pET28a plasmids were grown at 37 °C in LB with appropriate antibiotics. Expression of chaperones and UGT proteins was induced by the addition of l-arabinose and 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, respectively, as described above, and cultures were simultaneously supplemented with 40 μg ml−1 flavonoids. Cultures were grown at 22 °C for 24–48 h and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. One-milliliter medium aliquots were extracted with ethyl acetate as described above, vacuum-dried, and resuspended in methanol for subsequent LC-MS analysis. Acid hydrolysis was performed to differentiate between O- and C-glycosylated products as an acidic treatment hydrolyzes O-glycosidic linkages, whereas C-linked conjugates are stable to this treatment. After extraction with ethyl acetate, an equal volume of 2 n HCl was added to the samples followed by incubation at 90 °C for 1 h. One volume of 100% methanol was added to prevent the precipitation of aglycones. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg ml−1 flavonoid substrates, 2 mm UDP-glucose, and 5 μg of recombinant purified protein in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme and terminated by extraction with ethyl acetate. Activity assays were performed at 30 °C for up to 60 min. Reaction products were analyzed by LC-MS using a system consisting of an Agilent 1100 high-performance liquid chromatography pump, and a Bruker micrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer in a positive-ion mode configured with a Turbo-ion spray source setting collision energy 25 eV. Samples (10 μl) were chromatographed on a Phenomenex Hypersil GOLD C18 (3 μm; 2.0 by 150 mm) at 200 μl/min with a linear gradient from 20% MeCN to 100% in 0.1% formic acid over 10 min. The eluate was delivered unsplit into the mass spectrometer source. Compounds were identified by comparison of mass spectra to those of authentic commercial standards (Sigma-Aldrich and Indofine Chemical Company). Absorbance units were detected at 295 and 360 nm. Tissues from three independent biological replicates were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was extracted following the Trizol protocol (Invitrogen) followed by DNase treatment (Promega). cDNAs were synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA using Superscript Reverse Transcription Enzyme II (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) as a primer. The resulting cDNAs were used as templates for qPCR in a iCycler iQ detection system with the Optical System Software version 3.0a (Bio-Rad) using the intercalation dye SYBR Green I (Invitrogen) as a fluorescent reporter and Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Primers were designed to generate unique 150–250-bp fragments using PRIMER3 software (33.Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Primer3 on the WWW for general users and for biologist programmers.Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three biological replicates were used for each sample plus a negative control (reaction without reverse transcriptase). To normalize the data, primers for actin1 (J01238) were used (supplemental Table 1). Amplification conditions were as follows: 2-min denaturation at 94 °C and 40–45 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s followed by 5 min at 72 °C. Melting curves for each PCR product were determined by measuring the decrease of fluorescence with increasing temperature (from 65 to 95 °C). To confirm the size of the PCR products and to check that they corresponded to a unique and expected PCR product, the final PCR products were separated on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel, stained with SYBR Green (Invitrogen), and sequenced. Primers used for UGT708A6 are listed in supplemental Table 1 (UGT708A6-RT-forward and UGT708A6-RT-reverse). Flavonoid extraction was performed as described previously (12.Casati P. Walbot V. Differential accumulation of maysin and rhamnosylisoorientin in leaves of high-altitudes landraces of maize after UV-B exposure.Plant Cell Environ. 2005; 28: 788-799Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fresh silks and 25-day-after pollination pericarps were rinsed with water and lyophilized for 1 day. Dry weight was measured, and the sample was ground to a powder with a mortar and pestle. The powder was extracted for 8 h with 12 volumes of acidic methanol (1% (v/v) HCl in methanol) followed by a second extraction with 12 volumes of chloroform and 6 volumes of distilled water. The extracts were vortexed and centrifuged for 2 min at 3000 × g, and organic phases were collected. Flavonoid extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The tree was constructed using MEGA 4.0 software with the neighbor joining method based on ClustalW multiple alignments (34.Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S.

To determine a putative candidate for C-glycosylation reaction of flavonoids in maize, we followed two criteria. First, we evaluated how genes of candidates were expressed in different maize tissues and whether they are regulated by the P1 transcription factor, extensively known to be involved in the regulation of C-glycosyl flavone biosynthesis (16.McMullen M.D. Kross H.

https://openalex.org/W2035318758,"Shewanella are renowned for their ability to respire on a wide range of electron acceptors, which has been partially accredited to the presence of a large number of the c-type cytochromes. In the model species S. oneidensis MR-1, at least 41 genes encode c-type cytochromes that are predicted to be intact, thereby likely functional. Previously, in-frame deletion mutants for 36 of these genes were obtained and characterized. In this study, first we completed the construction of an entire set of c-type cytochrome mutants utilizing a newly developed att-based mutagenesis approach, which is more effective and efficient than the approach used previously by circumventing the conventional cloning. Second, we investigated the cytochrome c maturation (Ccm) system in S. oneidensis. There are two loci predicted to encode components of the Ccm system, SO0259-SO0269 and SO0476-SO0478. The former is proven essential for cytochrome c maturation whereas the latter is dispensable. Unlike the single operon organization observed in other γ-proteobacteria, genes at the SO0259-SO0269 locus are uniquely organized into four operons, ccmABCDE, scyA, SO0265, and ccmFGH-SO0269. Functional analysis revealed that the SO0265 gene rather than the scyA and SO0269 genes are relevant to cytochrome c maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2109307504,"Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven inflammatory disease of the vessel wall, characterized by the chronic activation of macrophages. We investigated whether the helminth-derived antigens [soluble egg antigens (SEAs)] could modulate macrophage inflammatory responses and protect against atherosclerosis in mice. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, SEAs induce anti-inflammatory macrophages, typified by high levels of IL-10 and reduced secretion of proinflammatory mediators. In hyperlipidemic LDLR(-/-) mice, SEA treatment reduced plaque size by 44%, and plaques were less advanced compared with PBS-injected littermate controls. The atheroprotective effect of SEAs was found to be mainly independent of cholesterol lowering and T-lymphocyte responses but instead could be attributed to diminished myeloid cell activation. SEAs reduced circulating neutrophils and inflammatory Ly6C(high) monocytes, and macrophages showed high IL-10 production. In line with the observed systemic effects, atherosclerotic lesions of SEA-treated mice showed reduced intraplaque inflammation as inflammatory markers [TNF-α, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and CD68], neutrophil content, and newly recruited macrophages were decreased. We show that SEA treatment protects against atherosclerosis development by dampening inflammatory responses. In the future, helminth-derived components may provide novel opportunities to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, as they diminish systemic inflammation and reduce the activation of immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W1977989441,"Uterine leiomyomas (ULs) are benign tumors occurring in the majority of reproductive aged women. Despite the high prevalence of these tumors, little is known about their etiology. A hallmark of ULs is the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), primarily collagens. Collagens are known to modulate cell behavior and function singularly or through interactions with integrins and growth factor-mediated mitogenic pathways. To better understand the pathogenesis of ULs and the role of ECM collagens in their growth, we investigated the interaction of leiomyoma smooth muscle cells (LSMCs) with two different forms of collagen, non-polymerized collagen (monomeric) and polymerized collagen (fibrillar), in the absence or presence of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), an abundant growth factor in ULs. Primary cultures of human LSMCS from symptomatic patients were grown on these two different collagen matrices and their morphology, cytoskeletal organization, cellular proliferation, and signaling pathways were evaluated. Our results showed that LSMCs had distinct morphologies on the different collagen matrices and their basal as well as PDGF-stimulated proliferation varied on these matrices. These differences in proliferation were accompanied by changes in cell cycle progression and p21, an inhibitory cell cycle protein. In addition we found alterations in the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, cytoskeletal reorganization, and activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a direct effect of ECM on the proliferation of LSMCs through interplay between the collagen matrix and the PDGF-stimulated MAPK pathway. In addition, these findings will pave the way for identifying novel therapeutic approaches for ULs that target ECM proteins and their signaling pathways in ULs."

Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a heterodimeric protein that is aberrantly overexpressed in most human breast cancers. In studies of breast cancer cells stably silenced for MUC1 or overexpressing the oncogenic MUC1-C subunit, we demonstrate that MUC1-C is sufficient for induction of MEK→ERK signaling and that treatment with a MUC1-C inhibitor suppresses ERK activation.

The results further show that MUC1-C and C/EBPβ form a complex on the ALDH1A1 gene promoter and activate ALDH1A1 gene transcription.

Foka P. CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins: structure, function and regulation.Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Google Scholar). Multiple isoforms of human C/EBPβ (p55, p45/42, and p20) are expressed as a result of alternative sites for translation initiation (2.Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. Characterization of C/EBPβ isoforms in normal versus neoplastic mammary epithelial cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 91-105Google Scholar). The C/EBPβ p55 and p45/42 isoforms (LAP1 and LAP2) function as transcriptional activators, whereas the p20 isoform (LIP) acts as a repressor (3.Descombes P. Schibler U. A liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein, LAP, and a transcriptional inhibitory protein, LIP, are translated from the same mRNA.Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Google Scholar). C/EBPβ plays an important role in mammary gland development by regulating stem cell repopulation activity and specifying luminal cell fate (4.Grimm S.L. Rosen J.M.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein mucin 1 MUC1 C-terminal subunit MUC1 cytoplasmic domain extracellular signal-regulated kinase aldehyde dehydrogenase. The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily of enzymes plays an important role in cellular signaling and protection by catalyzing the oxidation of aldehydes (13.Marchitti S.A. Brocker C. Stagos D. Vasiliou V. Non-P450 aldehyde oxidizing enzymes: the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily.Expert Opin. Drug Metab. Toxicol. 2008; 4: 697-720Google Scholar). The ALDH1A1 isoform has been a particular focus of study as a marker for both normal and cancer stem cells (14.Ma I. Allan A.L. The role of human aldehyde dehydrogenase in normal and cancer stem cells.Stem Cell Rev. 2011; 7: 292-306Google Scholar). ALDH1A1 functions in part by oxidizing retinol to retinoic acid, a regulator of gene transcription and inducer of cellular differentiation (15.Douville J. Beaulieu R. Balicki D. ALDH1 as a functional marker of cancer stem and progenitor cells.Stem Cells Dev. 2009; 18: 17-25Google Scholar). In this respect, high expression of ALDH1A1 in normal hematopoietic stem cells has been linked to retinoid metabolism and control of self-renewal capacity (16.Chute J.P. Muramoto G.G. Whitesides J. Colvin M. Safi R. Chao N.J. McDonnell D.P. Inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase and retinoid signaling induces the expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11707-11712Google Scholar). ALDH1A1 has also been identified as a marker of normal and malignant mammary stem cells that regulates retinoid signaling and breast cancer stem cell differentiation (17.Ginestier C. Hur M.H. Charafe-Jauffret E. Monville F. Dutcher J. Brown M. Jacquemier J. Viens P. Kleer C.G. Liu S. Schott A. Hayes D. Birnbaum D. Wicha M.S. Dontu G.

Despite the potential role of ALDH1 in self-renewal and differentiation, little is known about the regulation of ALDH1A1 expression in cancer cells. Studies in human K562 erythroleukemia and Hep3B hepatoma cells demonstrated that the ALDH1A1 promoter contains a positive regulatory region (−91 to +53 bp to the transcription start site) with a CCAAT box as the major cis-acting element (19.Yanagawa Y. Chen J.C. Hsu L.C. Yoshida A. The transcriptional regulation of human aldehyde dehydrogenase I gene. The structural and functional analysis of the promoter.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17521-17527Google Scholar). Other work in mouse hepatoma cells showed that the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) transactivates the ALDH1A1 promoter by binding to a RA response-like element (RARE) located at positions −91 to −75 bp (20.Elizondo G. Corchero J. Sterneck E. Gonzalez F.J. Feedback inhibition of the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase gene ALDH1 by retinoic acid through retinoic acid receptor alpha and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39747-39753Google Scholar). In addition, C/EBPβ has been shown to transactivate the ALDH1A1 promoter by interacting with the CCAAT box that resides at −75 to −71 bp adjacent to the RARE (20.Elizondo G. Corchero J. Sterneck E. Gonzalez F.J. Feedback inhibition of the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase gene ALDH1 by retinoic acid through retinoic acid receptor alpha and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39747-39753Google Scholar). These findings and the demonstration that ERK activates C/EBPβ invoked the possibility that ERK→C/EBPβ signaling may contribute to induction of ALDH1A1 expression in cancer cells. Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a transmembrane protein that is aberrantly overexpressed in most human breast cancers (21.Kufe D. Mucins in cancer: function, prognosis and therapy.Nature Reviews Cancer. 2009; 9: 874-885Google Scholar, 22.Kufe D. MUC1-C oncoprotein as a target in breast cancer: activation of signaling pathways and therapeutic approaches.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 1073-1081Google Scholar). Studies of MUC1 function have been directed by the findings that MUC1 undergoes auto-cleavage into two subunits that, in turn, form a stable non-covalent complex at the cell membrane (22.Kufe D. MUC1-C oncoprotein as a target in breast cancer: activation of signaling pathways and therapeutic approaches.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 1073-1081Google Scholar). The MUC1 N-terminal subunit (MUC1-N) contains glycosylated tandem repeats that are a physical characteristic of the mucin family members. MUC1-N is positioned extracellularly in a heterodimeric complex with the MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) that spans the cell membrane (21.Kufe D. Mucins in cancer: function, prognosis and therapy.Nature Reviews Cancer. 2009; 9: 874-885Google Scholar, 22.Kufe D. MUC1-C oncoprotein as a target in breast cancer: activation of signaling pathways and therapeutic approaches.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 1073-1081Google Scholar). The MUC1-N/MUC1-C heterodimer resides at the apical membrane of non-transformed epithelial cells. However, with stress or transformation and thereby loss of polarity, the MUC1-N/MUC1-C complex is expressed over the entire cell membrane, where it interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR, HER2, and others (23.Li Y. Ren J. Yu W. Li Q. Kuwahara H. Yin L. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Kufe D. The EGF receptor regulates interaction of the human DF3/MUC1 carcinoma antigen with c-Src and β-catenin.J. Biol.

The weight of evidence further supports a role for the MUC1-C subunit in conferring RTK activation. In this regard, targeting MUC1-C down-regulates HER2 activation and its downstream signals in breast cancer cells (26.Raina D. Uchida Y. Kharbanda A. Rajabi H. Panchamoorthy G. Jin C. Kharbanda S.

The MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain also contains a YHPM site that, when phosphorylated on tyrosine, interacts with PI3K and contributes to activation of the AKT pathway (27.Raina D. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.

In addition, the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain contains a pYTNP site that interacts with GRB2, linking MUC1-C to SOS and the RAS pathway (29.Pandey P. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.

Moreover, the MUC1-C subunit localizes to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors, such as NF-κB, and promotes expression of genes involved in growth and survival (30.Ahmad R.

The present studies demonstrate that MUC1-C induces ERK signaling and thereby phosphorylation and activation of C/EBPβ. We also show that a complex of MUC1-C and C/EBPβ occupies the ALDH1A1 promoter and induces ALDH1A1 expression. These findings support a novel MUC1-C→ERK→C/EBPβ pathway that up-regulates ALDH activity in breast cancer cells. Human MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. SKBR3 breast cancer cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium containing FBS, antibiotics, and l-glutamine.

Immunoprecipitation of soluble proteins was performed with anti-C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-MUC1-C (CT2; LabVision). Precipitates and cell lysates not subjected to precipitation were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MUC1-C (LabVision), anti-phospho-MEK, anti-MEK, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-C/EBPβ (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-C/EBPβ, anti-NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-β-actin (Sigma). Detection of immune complexes was achieved using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). For qRT-PCR analysis of C/EBPβ and ALDH1A1 mRNA levels, cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). cDNA samples were amplified using the SYBR green qPCR assay kit (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). Primers used for qRT-PCR detection of C/EBPβ and ALDH1A1 are listed in supplemental Table S1. Statistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. Cells plated on cover slips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/2% sucrose solution for 15 min and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, incubated with anti-MUC1-C or anti-p-C/EBPβ (Abcam) antibodies diluted in 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS and incubated with appropriate conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS for 25 min at 37 °C. Following two washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on slides with Prolong Gold Antifade mounting reagent containing DAPI (Invitrogen) and stored in the dark at 4 °C overnight to cure before visualization. The slides were visualized using a Leica SP5X: Laser Scanning Confocal microscope. Images were processed using ImageJ software program (NIH). GST-tagged human C/EBPβ was generated by subcloning C/EBPβ from pBABE-puro-LAP2 plasmid vector (Addgene) into the pGEX-5X-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare). GST-C/EBPβ(C35A) and GST-C/EBPβ(C184A) were generated from GST-C/EBPβ by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Purified MUC1-CD, MUC1-CD(1–45), MUC1-CD(46–72), and MUC1-CD(AQA) were prepared by expressing the appropriate GST-fusion protein and cleavage of the GST tag with thrombin as described (37.Leng Y.

GST and GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione beads were incubated with purified proteins. The adsorbates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-C/EBPβ or anti-MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain antibodies CD1 (38.Panchamoorthy G. Rehan H. Kharbanda A. Ahmad R. Kufe D. A monoclonal antibody against the oncogenic mucin 1 cytoplasmic domain.Hybridoma. 2011; 30: 531-535Google Scholar) or CT2 (Ab5; LabVision). Cells were transfected with pGL3, pGL3-pALDH1A1-Luc or pGL3-pALDH1A1(CCAAT→GAGTC; mut)-Luc and, as an internal control, SV-40-Renilla-Luc (Promega) in the presence of Superfect (Qiagen). After 48 h, the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer. The lysates were analyzed using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Soluble chromatin was prepared as described (32.Rajabi H. Ahmad R.

MUC1-C oncoprotein confers androgen-independent growth of human prostate cancer cells.Prostate. 2012; 72: 1659-1668Google Scholar) and precipitated with anti-C/EBPβ or a control nonimmune IgG. For re-ChIP assays, C/EBPβ complexes from the primary ChIP were eluted and reimmunoprecipitated with anti-MUC1-C as described (39.Rajabi H. Joshi M.D. Jin C. Ahmad R. Kufe D. Androgen receptor regulates expression of the MUC1-C oncoprotein in human prostate cancer cells.Prostate. 2011; 71: 1299-1308Google Scholar). The SYBR green qPCR assay kit was used for real time ChIP qPCR with the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). The primers used for qPCR of the ALDH1A1 promoter and control region are listed in supplemental Table S2. Relative fold enrichment was calculated as described (40.Wang Q. Carroll J.S. Brown M. Spatial and temporal recruitment of androgen receptor and its coactivators involves chromosomal looping and polymerase tracking.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 631-642Google Scholar). ALDH enzymatic activity was measured using the Aldefluor kit (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells suspended in aldefluor assay buffer were incubated with ALDH enzyme substrate, BODIPY-aminoacetaldehyde (BAAA), for 40 min at 37 °C. As a control for baseline fluorescence, cells were also treated with the ALDH inhibitor, diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB). Fluorescence was detected using a BD Biosciences LSRFortessa flow cytometer and analyzed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Statistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. Single-cell suspensions were cultured in MammoCult™ Human Medium Kit (StemCell Technologies) at a density of 40,000 cells per well of a 6-well ultra-low attachment culture plate (Corning CoStar). For first generation M1 culturing, cells were grown with replenishment of the medium twice over 7 days. For second M2 generation culturing, M1 mammospheres were harvested, incubated with trypsin for 3 min at 37 °C, and mechanically dispersed by gentle pipetting. Single cells were confirmed under a microscope, counted, and resuspended in fresh MammoCult™ medium. Mammospheres were imaged using a Nikon inverted TE2000 microscope. C/EBPβ is an auto-repressed transcription factor that is activated by ERK-mediated phosphorylation on Thr-235 (10.Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A.

Johnson P.F. RSK-mediated phosphorylation in the C/EBP{β} leucine zipper regulates DNA binding, dimerization, and growth arrest activity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2621-2635Google Scholar). MUC1-C has been linked to activation of the RAS→MEK→ERK pathway (29.Pandey P. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Association of the DF3/MUC1 breast cancer antigen with Grb2 and the Sos/Ras exchange protein.Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4000-4003Google Scholar, 42.Hattrup C.L. Gendler S.J.

Overexpression of MUC1 enhances proangiogenic activity of non-small-cell lung cancer cells through activation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways.Lung. 2011; 189: 453-460Google Scholar). To determine whether MUC1-C plays a role in the regulation of C/EBPβ, we stably silenced MUC1 in triple-negative MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (Fig. 1A). Down-regulation of MUC1-C was associated with a marked decrease in p-MEK and p-ERK levels (Fig. 1A). In concert with ERK-mediated phosphorylation of C/EBPβ on Thr-235, abundance of p-C/EBPβ (p45/42; LAP2) was also decreased by MUC1-C silencing (Fig. 1A). By contrast, there was no detectable phosphorylation of the C/EBPβ p20 isoform (LIP) in MDA-MB-468/CshRNA or MDA-MB-468/MUC1shRNA cells (data not shown). Treatment with the MUC1-C inhibitor, GO-203, was similarly associated with down-regulation of MEK and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). In addition, GO-203 treatment resulted in a 55 ± 2% decrease in p-C/EBPβ levels (Fig. 1B, legend). In HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 breast cancer cells, targeting MUC1-C with silencing or treatment with GO-203 is associated with down-regulation of HER2 activation (26.Raina D. Uchida Y. Kharbanda A. Rajabi H. Panchamoorthy G. Jin C. Kharbanda S. Scaltriti M. Baselga J. Kufe D. Targeting the MUC1-C oncoprotein downregulates HER2 activation and abrogates trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer cells.Oncogene. 2013; (in press)Google Scholar). Silencing MUC1 in SKBR3 cells also resulted in decreased activation of MEK, ERK and C/EBPβ (Fig. 1C). In addition, treatment of SKBR3 cells with GO-203 was associated with suppression of p-MEK and p-ERK levels and a 54 ± 5% decrease in the abundance of p-C/EBPβ (Fig. 1D). As a control for involvement of ERK, treatment of the MDA-MB-468 and SKBR3 cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 decreased both ERK and C/EBPβ phosphorylation (Fig. 1, E and F). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that MUC1-C promotes ERK-dependent phosphorylation of C/EBPβ on Thr-235. Studies were also performed on MCF-7 breast cancer cells that express MUC1-C and C/EBPβ at levels lower than those found in MDA-MB-468 and SKBR3 cells (Fig. 2A). Here, stable overexpression of MUC1-C in MCF-7 cells was associated with increases in C/EBPβ protein (Fig. 2B, left). qRT-PCR further demonstrated that MUC1-C increases C/EBPβ mRNA levels (Fig. 2B, right). Similar results have been obtained with a separate set of MCF-7 cells that were transduced with lentiviruses expressing an empty vector or MUC1-C, indicating that the increase in C/EBPβ expression is not due to clonal selection (data not shown). Previous studies have linked NF-κB to activation of the C/EBPβ gene (44.Niehof M. Kubicka S. Zender L. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Autoregulation enables different pathways to control CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) transcription.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 855-868Google Scholar). In addition, MUC1-C interacts with NF-κB p65 and promotes NF-κB-mediated gene transcription (30.Ahmad R. Raina D. Joshi M.D. Kawano T. Ren J. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. MUC1-C oncoprotein functions as a direct activator of the NF-κB p65 transcription factor.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 7013-7021Google Scholar). To determine whether MUC1-C induces C/EBPβ expression by a NF-κB-dependent mechanism, we silenced NF-κB p65 in the MCF-7/MUC1-C cells (Fig. 2C). Silencing p65 was associated with down-regulation of C/EBPβ mRNA and protein (Fig. 2C, left and right). Treatment of MCF-7/MUC1-C cells with the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11–7085 also resulted in decreases in abundance of C/EBPβ protein (Fig. 2D, left). Diverse cell types respond to BAY11–7085 with increases in ERK phosphorylation (45.Relic B. Benoit V. Franchimont N. Ribbens C. Kaiser M.J. Gillet P. Merville M.P. Bours V. Malaise M.G. 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 inhibits Bay 11–7085-induced sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and apoptosis in human articular chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22399-22403Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in the MCF-7/MUC1-C cells (Fig. 2D, right), indicating that MUC1-C induces C/EBPβ protein levels by an NF-κB-dependent, ERK-independent pathway. With regard to MUC1-C-induced activation of the MEK→ERK pathway, overexpression of MUC1-C was associated with increases in p-MEK and p-ERK levels (Fig. 2E, left). In addition, we found that the MUC1-C-induced C/EBPβ protein is phosphorylated on Thr-235 (Fig. 2E, left) and that treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 blocks this modification (Fig. 2E, right). These results demonstrate that overexpression of MUC1-C in MCF-7 cells induces both C/EBPβ abundance and ERK-mediated phosphorylation of C/EBPβ on Thr-2"
https://openalex.org/W1983079740,"Because MUC1 carries a variety of sialoglycans that are possibly recognized by the siglec family, we examined MUC1-binding siglecs and found that Siglec-9 prominently bound to MUC1. An immunochemical study showed that Siglec-9-positive immune cells were associated with MUC1-positive cells in human colon, pancreas, and breast tumor tissues. We investigated whether or not this interaction has any functional implications for MUC1-expressing cells. When mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells and a human colon cancer cell line, HCT116, stably transfected with MUC1cDNA were ligated with recombinant soluble Siglec-9, β-catenin was recruited to the MUC1 C-terminal domain, which was enhanced on stimulation with soluble Siglec-9 in dose- and time-dependent manners. A co-culture model of MUC1-expressing cells and Siglec-9-expressing cells mimicking the interaction between MUC1-expressing malignant cells, and Siglec-9-expressing immune cells in a tumor microenvironment was designed. Brief co-incubation of Siglec-9-expressing HEK293 cells, but not mock HEK293 cells, with MUC1-expressing cells similarly enhanced the recruitment of β-catenin to the MUC1 C-terminal domain. In addition, treatment of MUC1-expressing cells with neuraminidase almost completely abolished the effect of Siglec-9 on MUC1-mediated signaling. The recruited β-catenin was thereafter transported to the nucleus, leading to cell growth.

Chen W. Li G. Huang L. Kufe D. MUC1 oncoprotein functions in activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling.Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Treatment of breast cancer cells with FGF increases the binding of MUC1-CD to β-catenin and targeting of MUC1-CD and β-catenin to the nucleus. Dysregulation of β-catenin is of great importance as to the development of diverse tumor malignances (11.Huang L. Chen D. Liu D. Yin L. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.

However, studies on signaling through MUC1 following direct ligation of MUC1-ND with an endogenous ligand have been limited except in the case of ICAM-1 (12.Rahn J.J. Shen Q. Mah B.K. Hugh J.C.

However, these studies provided no insights to the downstream signaling by MUC1 after binding of these lectins. In many tumor tissues, infiltrating immune cells such as macrophages are commonly found closely associated with tumor cells (17.O'Sullivan C. Lewis C.E. Tumour-associated leucocytes: friends or foes in breast carcinoma.J. Pathol. 1994; 172: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but little is known concerning the nature or significance of the adhesion and/or recognition molecules involved in such cellular interaction. Immune cells express various siglecs including Siglec-1. The Siglec family are sialic acid-binding, immunoglobulin-like lectin, most of which are expressed on immune cells (18.Crocker P.R. Varki A. Siglecs in the immune system.Immunology. 2001; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that mucins bound to Siglec-2 (19.Toda M. Hisano R. Yurugi H. Akita K. Maruyama K. Inoue M. Adachi T. Tsubata T. Nakada H. Ligation of tumour-produced mucins to CD22 dramatically impairs splenic marginal zone B-cells.Biochem.

Immunomodulation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells through ligation of tumor-produced mucins to Siglec-9.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 402: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which are expressed on B cells and dendritic cells, respectively, leading to negative immunomodulation in these cells. These facts raised the possibility that this direct binding of siglecs to MUC1 may bring about signal transduction through MUC1. To assess this signal transduction, we used mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells transfected with MUC1cDNA in addition to epithelial cancer cell lines, because 3T3/MUC1 cells may be useful to clarify the function of MUC1 in cells lacking tumor-associated genetic and epigenetic changes. In the present study, we demonstrated that direct binding of Siglec-9 to MUC1-ND triggers recruitment of β-catenin to MUC1-CD, followed by nuclear transport in the manner like growth factor-triggered MUC1-CD mediated signaling. Thus, this MUC1-mediated signaling may work co-operatively with a growth factor-triggered pathway. Mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells, a human colon cancer cell line, HCT116, a human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, and a human alveolar cell line, A549, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. 3T3/MUC1 and HCT116/MUC1 cells were prepared by introducing MUC1cDNA into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and human colon cancer HCT116 cells, respectively, as described previously (9.Li Y. Ren J. Yu W. Li Q. Kuwahara H. Yin L. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Kufe D. The epidermal growth factor receptor regulates interaction of the human DF3/MUC1 carcinoma antigen with c-Src and β-catenin.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35239-35242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and 3T3 and HCT116 mock cells were prepared by transfection of the empty vector. 3T3/mock and 3T3/MUC1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. HCT116/mock and HCT116/MUC1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK293 cells expressing Siglec-9 (HEK293/Siglec-9) and mock cells (HEK293/mock) were obtained by transfection of Siglec-9 cDNA and the empty vector, respectively, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm glucose and 10% fetal calf serum. A549 cells were cultured in F-12 K medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. 3T3/MUC1 cells (5 × 103 cells) were cultured in the presence or absence of recombinant soluble Siglec-9 (sSiglec-9) (R&D, 2.5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. After fixation with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were treated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X-100 and 10% goat serum, and then with mouse anti-β-catenin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a control IgG at room temperature for 2 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes) and propidium iodide. Slides were mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade reagents (Invitrogen). Distribution of MUC1-CD and β-catenin in the nucleus was examined using the same procedure as described above with combinations of mouse anti-β-catenin antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies, and Armenian hamster anti-MUC1 Ab5 antibodies (Neo Marker) and DyLight 594-labeled goat anti-hamster IgG antibodies (BioLegend), respectively. Sections of paraffin-embedded tumor and nonmalignant tissues were deparaffinized through xylene and alcohol gradients. Antigen retrieval was performed by treatment with 0.01 m citric acid buffer at 100 °C for 15 min. After washing with PBS, sections were blocked with 5% BSA-PBS and then with mouse anti-MUC1-ND antibodies (BD Biosciences) and rabbit anti-Siglec-9 antibodies (ABGENT) or a control IgG at 4 °C for 24 h. After washing with PBS, the sections were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies, Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes), and DAPI. Specimens of tumor and adjacent nonmalignant tissues were obtained from cancer patients in accordance with the protocol approved by Osaka City University. 3T3 and HCT116 mock cells, and their MUC1 transfectants (1 × 106 cells) were treated with mouse anti-MUC1-ND antibodies or a control mouse IgG in 0.5% BSA-PBS at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing with 0.5% BSA-PBS, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). 3T3/MUC1 cells (5 × 105 cells) were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-FGFR-3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a control IgG at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing as described above, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes). HEK293/Siglec-9 and HEK293/mock cells (1 × 106 cells) were incubated with mouse anti-Siglec-9 antibodies (R&D Systems) or a control mouse IgG in 0.5% BSA-PBS at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing with 0.5% BSA-PBS, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). 3T3/MUC1 and HCT116/MUC1 cells (1 × 106 cells) were also treated with biotin-labeled MAM (Vector Laboratories) at 4 °C for 2 h and then with FITC-labeled streptavidin (BD Biosciences). All cells were analyzed with a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). Fc-tagged Siglec-3, -5, and -9, and His-tagged Siglec-1 (R&D Systems, 2 μg of protein) were added to lysates (1 mg of protein) of 3T3/MUC1 cells, followed by mixing at 4 °C for 2 h. Proteins bound to siglecs were pulled down with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). MUC1 was purified from the conditioned medium of 3T3/MUC1 cells by gel filtration and CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (21.Klug T.L. LeDonne N.C. Greber T.F. Zurawski V.R. Purification and composition of a novel gastrointestinal tumor-associated glycoprotein expressing sialylated lacto-N-fucopentaose II (CA 19-9).Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1505-1511PubMed Google Scholar). Universal Bind 96-well plates (Corning) were coated with MUC1 (0.5 μg of protein) in PBS or PBS (control) at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by blocking with 2.5% BSA-PBS. Fc-tagged Siglec-9 (1 μg of protein) was added to the plates, followed by incubation for 1 h, and then washing with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. Bound Fc-tagged Siglec-9 was estimated with HRP-conjugated protein G (GE Healthcare) and a TMB peroxidase substrate system (Nacalai Tesque). 3T3/MUC1 and 3T3/mock cells (1 × 106 cells) were cultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 1 h prior to analysis, and then after washing with the same medium, the cells were treated with sSiglec-9 (1–5 μg of protein) for the indicated times in the same medium. When the phosphorylation of β-catenin was examined, these cells were treated with sSiglec-9 (5 μg of protein) for 40 min. When MUC1-mediated signaling was analyzed after co-incubation with Siglec-9-expressing cells, the following procedures were performed. 3T3/MUC1 cells and HCT116/MUC1 cells were cultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and DMEM, respectively, for 1 h prior to analysis. HEK293/Siglec-9 and HEK293/mock cells were also cultured in serum-free DMEM for 1 h prior to analysis. After washing all the cells with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, suspensions of 3T3/MUC1 or HCT116/MUC1 cells (1 × 106 cells) were mixed with suspensions of HEK293/Siglec-9 or HEK293/mock cells (1 × 106 cells) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and then rotated gently at 37 °C for 20 min. 3T3 and HCT116 mock cells, their MUC1 transfectants, and A549 cells were solubilized with a solubilizing solution (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). MUC1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates (500 μg of protein) of 3T3/MUC1, HCT116/MUC1, and A549 cells using mouse anti-MUC1-ND antibodies and protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow. EGFR and FGFR-3 were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates of 3T3/MUC1 and HCT116/MUC1 cells with rabbit anti-EGFR antibodies (Cell Signaling) and anti-FGFR-3 antibodies, respectively, and protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow. To examine the co-immunoprecipitation of MUC1-CD with β-catenin, MUC1-CD or β-catenin was immunoprecipitated using Armenian hamster anti-MUC1 Ab5 antibodies or mouse anti-β-catenin antibodies and protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow. Lysates of 3T3 and HCT116 mock cells, their transfectants, and neuraminidase-treated transfectants, immunoprecipitates, and proteins pulled down with siglecs as described above were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using Immuno-Blot PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad), except for the detection of MUC1-ND. In the case of MUC1-ND, Zeta-Probe Blotting membranes (Bio-Rad) were used. Detection of MUC1-ND, β-catenin, phosphorylated β-catenin, histone 2B, and IκB-α was performed using mouse anti-MUC1-ND, anti-β-catenin, anti-phosphorylated β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-histone 2B (Cell Signaling), and anti-IκB-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies, respectively, and HRP-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). FGFR-3, EGFR, c-Src, Lyn, Lck, and c-myc were detected using rabbit anti-FGFR-3, anti-EGFR (Cell Signaling), anti-c-Src (Cell Signaling), anti-Lyn (Cell Signaling), anti-Lck (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-c-myc (Cell Signaling) antibodies, and HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). MUC1-CD was detected using Armenian hamster anti-MUC1 Ab5 antibodies and HRP-labeled goat anti-hamster IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The intensity of bands was determined using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Cell fractionation was performed basically according to Halwani et al. (22.Halwani R. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Saadatmand J. Kim S. Shiba K. Kleiman L. Cellular distribution of lysyl-tRNA synthetase and its interaction with GAG during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 assembly.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7553-7564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 3T3/MUC1 and HCT116/MUC1 cells (1 × 106 cells) were treated with 50 milliunits of neuraminidase (Arthrobacter ureafaciens, Nacalai Tesque) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C for 1 h. 3T3/MUC1 cells (2 × 103 cells) were treated with or without sSiglec-9 for 20 min and then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum until 72 h. Cell growth was determined by means of the MTT assay. 3T3/MUC1 cells (1 × 106 cells) treated with or without sSiglec-9 and cultured as described above were solubilized at 24 h after treatment with sSiglec-9, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting and detection with rabbit anti-c-myc antibodies. MUC1cDNA was introduced into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, and stable transfectants were obtained. MUC1 expression was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A). There was no detectable MUC1 expression on cells transfected with the empty vector. A cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting, and detection with anti-MUC1-ND and -CD antibodies. The bands of MUC1-ND and -CD were detected at the positions of ∼250 and 15–25 kDa, respectively. Multiple bands of MUC1-CD are considered to be due to different levels of N-glycosylation, as described previously (23.Lan M.S. Batra S.K. Qi W.N. Metzgar R.S. Hollingsworth M.A. Cloning and sequencing of a human pancreatic tumor mucin cDNA.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15294-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). To examine the binding of siglecs to MUC1, soluble tagged Siglec-1, -3, -5, and -9 were added to lysates of 3T3/MUC1 cells, followed by mixing. Proteins associated with these siglecs were pulled down and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. MUC1-ND was detected in all precipitates pulled down with siglecs (Fig. 1B). Because MUC1 was pulled down predominantly with Siglec-9 (Fig. 1B, lane b), further experiments were performed using recombinant soluble Siglec-9 (sSiglec-9). Furthermore, MUC1-ND was prepared from culture medium of 3T3/MUC1 cells and immobilized on a microplate. Binding of sSiglec9 to MUC1-ND was also confirmed by means of a plate assay (Fig. 1C). To determine whether or not Siglec-9-expressing cells are actually associated with MUC1-positive cells in human tumor tissues, colon, breast, and pancreas tumor tissues were immunostained with anti-Siglec-9 and anti-MUC1-ND antibodies as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 2). Siglec-9-positive cells were frequently observed in MUC1-positive colon, breast, and pancreatic tissues, whereas a lower level of MUC1 was expressed and a smaller number of Siglec-9-positive cells were observed in nonmalignant colon tissues compared with tumor tissues. A similar staining pattern was obtained for other nonmalignant tissues (data not shown). In tumor tissues, many Siglec-9-positive cells were closely associated with MUC1-positive cells, suggesting an interaction between Siglec-9 and MUC1. It has been reported that EGF and FGF receptors are associated with MUC1 in some human carcinoma cells and mouse mammary glands and that ligation with each growth factor induces the binding of β-catenin to MUC1 (7.Schroeder J.A. Thompson M.C. Gardner M.M. Gendler S.J. Transgenic MUC1 interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor and correlates with mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in the mouse mammary gland.J.

MUC1 oncoprotein functions in activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling.Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Considering these reports, we examined the expression of these receptors on 3T3/MUC1 cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3A, 3T3/MUC1 cells expressed FGFR-3 but not EGFR. To determine whether or not MUC1 associates with FGFR-3, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. From a lysate of 3T3/MUC1 cells, MUC1-ND was immunoprecipitated and then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. FGFR-3 was not detected in the immunoprecipitate obtained with anti-MUC1-ND antibodies (Fig. 3B, lane b). In a reciprocal experiment, MUC1-ND was not co-immunoprecipitated with anti-FGFR-3 antibodies (Fig. 3B, lane c). Because ligation of Siglec-9 or FGF may have some effect on the association between MUC1 and FGFR-3, cells were treated in the presence or absence of FGF or sSiglec-9, and then cell lysates were prepared. The immunoprecipitates derived from a cell lysate with either anti-FGFR-3 antibodies or anti-MUC1-ND antibodies were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the other. Co-immunoprecipitation of MUC1 and FGFR-3 was not observed, irrespective of ligation with FGF or sSiglec-9, as shown in Fig. 3, C and D. Thus, it appears likely that MUC1 does not function in signaling from FGF receptors in 3T3/MUC1 cells. Furthermore, a similar experiment was performed using HCT116/MUC1 cells. MUC1 or EGFR was immunoprecipitated from a lysate of HCT116/MUC1 cells and then analyzed as described above. Although MUC1 and EGFR were detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-MUC1-ND and anti-EGFR antibodies, respectively (Fig. 3E, lanes a and d), EGFR and MUC1 were not co-immunoprecipitated with MUC1 and EGFR, respectively (Fig. 3E, lanes b and c). It has been reported that MUC1-mediated signaling originates indirectly through ligation of growth factors such as EGF and FGF with the receptors that are associated with MUC1 on the cell surface (6.Li Y.

https://openalex.org/W2113914042,"Proteins misfolded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are cleared by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system in the cytosol, a series of events collectively termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD). It was previously shown that SEL1L, a partner protein of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1, is required for degradation of misfolded luminal proteins (ERAD-Ls substrates) but not misfolded transmembrane proteins (ERAD-Lm substrates) in both mammalian and chicken DT40 cells. Here, we analyzed ATF6, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a sensor/transducer of the unfolded protein response, as a potential ERAD-Lm substrate in DT40 cells. Unexpectedly, degradation of endogenous ATF6 and exogenously expressed chicken and human ATF6 by the proteasome required SEL1L. Deletion analysis revealed that the luminal region of ATF6 is a determinant for SEL1L-dependent degradation. Chimeric analysis showed that the luminal region of ATF6 confers SEL1L dependence on type I transmembrane protein as well. In contrast, degradation of other known type I ERAD-Lm substrates (BACE457, T-cell receptor-α, CD3-δ, and CD147) did not require SEL1L. Thus, ATF6 represents a novel type of ERAD-Lm substrate requiring SEL1L for degradation despite its transmembrane nature. In addition, endogenous ATF6 was markedly stabilized in wild-type cells treated with kifunensine, an inhibitor of α1,2-mannosidase in the ER, indicating that degradation of ATF6 requires proper mannose trimming. Our further analyses revealed that the five ERAD-Lm substrates examined are classified into three subgroups based on their dependence on mannose trimming and SEL1L. Thus, ERAD-Lm substrates are degraded through much more diversified mechanisms in higher eukaryotes than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2028775235,"Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), as ubiquitous molecular chaperones found in all forms of life, are known to be able to protect cells against stresses and suppress the aggregation of a variety of model substrate proteins under in vitro conditions. Nevertheless, it is poorly understood what natural substrate proteins are protected by sHSPs in living cells. Here, by using a genetically incorporated photo-cross-linker (p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine), we identified a total of 95 and 54 natural substrate proteins of IbpB (an sHSP from Escherichia coli) in living cells with and without heat shock, respectively. Functional profiling of these proteins (110 in total) suggests that IbpB, although binding to a wide range of cellular proteins, has a remarkable substrate preference for translation-related proteins (e.g. ribosomal proteins and amino-acyl tRNA synthetases) and moderate preference for metabolic enzymes. Furthermore, these two classes of proteins were found to be more prone to aggregation and/or inactivation in cells lacking IbpB under stress conditions (e.g. heat shock). Together, our in vivo data offer novel insights into the chaperone function of IbpB, or sHSPs in general, and suggest that the preferential protection on the protein synthesis machine and metabolic enzymes may dominantly contribute to the well known protective effect of sHSPs on cell survival against stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2033977632,"Drs2p, a yeast type IV P-type ATPase (P4-ATPase), or flippase, couples ATP hydrolysis to phosphatidylserine translocation and the establishment of membrane asymmetry. A previous study has shown that affinity-purified Drs2p, possessing an N-terminal tandem affinity purification tag (TAPN-Drs2), retains ATPase and translocase activity, but Drs2p purified using a C-terminal tag (Drs2-TAPC) was inactive. In this study, we show that the ATPase activity of N-terminally purified Drs2p associates primarily with a proteolyzed form of Drs2p lacking the C-terminal cytosolic tail. Truncation of most of the Drs2p C-terminal tail sequence activates its ATPase activity by ∼4-fold. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the C-terminal tail of Drs2p is auto-inhibitory to Drs2p activity. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) has been shown to positively regulate Drs2p activity in isolated Golgi membranes through interaction with the C-terminal tail. In proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified, N-terminally TAP-tagged Drs2p, both ATPase and flippase activity were significantly higher in the presence of PI(4)P. In contrast, PI(4)P had no significant effect on the activity of a truncated form of Drs2p, which lacked the C-terminal tail. This work provides the first direct evidence, in a purified system, that a phospholipid flippase is subject to auto-inhibition by its C-terminal tail, which can be relieved by a phosphoinositide to stimulate flippase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2013289018,"Serum antibodies and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) are important host defense factors for host adaptive and innate immunity, respectively. Antibodies and MBL also initiate the classical and lectin complement pathways, respectively, leading to opsonophagocytosis. We have shown previously that Staphylococcus aureus wall teichoic acid (WTA), a cell wall glycopolymer consisting of ribitol phosphate substituted with α- or β-O-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and d-alanine, is recognized by MBL and serum anti-WTA IgG. However, the exact antigenic determinants to which anti-WTA antibodies or MBL bind have not been determined. To answer this question, several S. aureus mutants, such as α-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase-deficient S. aureus ΔtarM, β-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase-deficient ΔtarS, and ΔtarMS double mutant cells, were prepared from a laboratory and a community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain. Here, we describe the unexpected finding that β-GlcNAc WTA-deficient ΔtarS mutant cells (which have intact α-GlcNAc) escape from anti-WTA antibody-mediated opsonophagocytosis, whereas α-GlcNAc WTA-deficient ΔtarM mutant cells (which have intact β-GlcNAc) are efficiently engulfed by human leukocytes via anti-WTA IgG. Likewise, MBL binding in S. aureus cells was lost in the ΔtarMS double mutant but not in either single mutant. When we determined the serum concentrations of the anti-α- or anti-β-GlcNAc-specific WTA IgGs, anti-β-GlcNAc WTA-IgG was dominant in pooled human IgG fractions and in the intact sera of healthy adults and infants. These data demonstrate the importance of the WTA sugar conformation for human innate and adaptive immunity against S. aureus infection.Background: The exact staphylococcal antigenic determinants of anti-staphylococcal IgG and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) have not been determined.Results: The antigenic epitopes of the staphylococcal wall teichoic acid (WTA) for serum IgG and MBL are O-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues.Conclusion: The sugar moiety of WTA is an important molecular determinant in host responses to S. aureus.Significance: The results provide new insights into the host-pathogen interaction.

Results: The antigenic epitopes of the staphylococcal wall teichoic acid (WTA) for serum IgG and MBL are O-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues. Conclusion: The sugar moiety of WTA is an important molecular determinant in host responses to S. aureus. Significance: The results provide new insights into the host-pathogen interaction. Staphylococcus aureus can cause serious infections of the skin, soft tissue, and bloodstream in the community and in hospitalized patients (1.Lowy F.D. Staphylococcus aureus infections.N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Google Scholar).

S. aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen that is surrounded by glycopolymers, including wall teichoic acid (WTA), peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, and capsular polysaccharide. S. aureus WTA is a glycopolymer that covalently links to peptidoglycan and is composed of an N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc)-(β-1,3)-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) disaccharide with two glycerol phosphates followed by 10–40 ribitol phosphate repeating units (Fig. 1) (2.Weidenmaier C. Peschel A. Teichoic acids and related cell-wall glycopolymers in Gram-positive physiology and host interactions.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 276-287Google Scholar, 3.Swoboda J.G. Campbell J. Meredith T.C. Walker S. Wall teichoic acid function, biosynthesis, and inhibition.Chembiochem. 2010; 11: 35-45Google Scholar). The hydroxyls on the ribitol phosphate repeats are modified with cationic d-alanine esters and O-GlcNAc (4.Xia G. Kohler T. Peschel A. The wall teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid polymers of Staphylococcus aureus.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2010; 300: 148-154Google Scholar). Although WTA is dispensable for bacterial viability, it was reported to be involved in the adherence of S. aureus to nasal epithelial cells (5.Weidenmaier C. Kokai-Kun J.F. Kristian S.A. Chanturiya T. Kalbacher H. Gross M. Nicholson G. Neumeister B. Mond J.J. Peschel A. Role of teichoic acids in Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization, a major risk factor in nosocomial infections.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 243-245Google Scholar), resistance to lysozyme and antimicrobial peptides, and evasion of the innate immune response (6.Tabuchi Y. Shiratsuchi A. Kurokawa K. Gong J.H. Sekimizu K. Lee B.L. Nakanishi Y. Inhibitory role for d-alanylation of wall teichoic acid in activation of insect Toll pathway by peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus aureus.J.

Biochemical characterization of evasion from peptidoglycan recognition by Staphylococcus aureusd-alanylated wall teichoic acid in insect innate immunity.Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2011; 35: 835-839Google Scholar). The zwitterionic S. aureus WTA has been reported to induce CD4+ T-cell proliferation in a major histocompatibility complex II-dependent manner, which in turn, modulates abscess formation in a mouse skin infection model (8.Weidenmaier C. McLoughlin R.M. Lee J.C. The zwitterionic cell wall teichoic acid of Staphylococcus aureus provokes skin abscesses in mice by a novel CD4+ T-cell-dependent mechanism.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e13227Google Scholar). methicillin-resistant S. aureus mannose-binding lectin wall teichoic acid MBL-associated serine protease human polymorphonuclear leukocytes intravenous IgG N-acetylmannosamine Fcγ receptor. The complement system is the first line of host defense responses to invading pathogens (9.Ricklin D. Hajishengallis G. Yang K. Lambris J.D. Complement. A key system for immune surveillance and homeostasis.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 785-797Google Scholar). Pathogen-specific antibodies activate the classical complement pathway (10.Daha N.A. Banda N.K. Roos A. Beurskens F.J. Bakker J.M. Daha M.R. Trouw L.A. Complement activation by (auto-)antibodies.Mol. Immunol. 2011; 48: 1656-1665Google Scholar). Bacterial surface glycopolymers are also recognized by a variety of pattern recognition molecules, including mannose-binding lectin (MBL) (11.Fujita T. Evolution of the lectin-complement pathway and its role in innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 346-353Google Scholar, 12.Ip W.K. Takahashi K. Ezekowitz R.A. Stuart L.M. Mannose-binding lectin and innate immunity.Immunol. Rev. 2009; 230: 9-21Google Scholar). MBL binds to mannose and the GlcNAc residues of sugar chains (13.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structural basis of lectin-carbohydrate recognition.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Google Scholar) and functions as an opsonin and an activator of the lectin complement pathway (14.Walport M.J. Complement. First of two parts.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Google Scholar). The activation of the classical and lectin pathways mediates opsonization by complement fragments, such as C4b and C3b, proinflammatory signaling by anaphylatoxins for recruiting phagocytes, and cell lysis of Gram-negative bacteria by membrane attack complex formation. The immune complexes also induce phagocytosis via cell surface Fcγ receptors (FcγRs). Because S. aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium with a thick peptidoglycan layer, many reports have suggested that serum antibody-mediated opsonophagocytosis is necessary to combat pathogenic S. aureus infection (10.Daha N.A. Banda N.K. Roos A. Beurskens F.J. Bakker J.M. Daha M.R. Trouw L.A. Complement activation by (auto-)antibodies.Mol. Immunol. 2011; 48: 1656-1665Google Scholar, 15.Joiner K.A. Brown E.J. Frank M.M. Complement and bacteria. Chemistry and biology in host defense.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 461-491Google Scholar). Additionally, MBL deficiency in mice caused susceptibility to S. aureus infection (16.Shi L. Takahashi K. Dundee J. Shahroor-Karni S. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Gad F. Hamblin M.R. Sastry K.N. Ezekowitz R.A. Mannose-binding lectin-deficient mice are susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1379-1390Google Scholar). Therefore, complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis and FcγR-mediated phagocytosis are important components of protection from S. aureus infections, including those caused by MRSA strains, such as USA300 (17.Pozzi C. Wilk K. Lee J.C. Gening M. Nifantiev N. Pier G.B. Opsonic and protective properties of antibodies raised to conjugate vaccines targeting six Staphylococcus aureus antigens.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e46648Google Scholar). In the early 1960s, immunochemical studies were conducted by several research groups to determine the epitope structure of the S. aureus cell wall (18.Nathenson S.G. Strominger J.L. Enzymatic synthesis and immunochemistry of N-acetylglucosaminylribitol linkages in the teichoic acids of Staphylococcus aureus stains.J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3839-3841Google Scholar, 19.Juergens W.G. Sanderson A.R. Strominger J.L. Chemical basis for an immunological specificity of a strain of Staphylococcus aureus.J. Exp. Med. 1963; 117: 925-935Google Scholar). When a mixture of formaldehyde-treated S. aureus Copenhagen strain and Freund's adjuvant was injected into rabbits, the agglutination activity of rabbit antisera was inhibited by S. aureus WTA or by the purified α-GlcNAc-substituted ribitol phosphate. Based on these observations, the rabbit sera were believed to contain anti-WTA antibodies specific to α-GlcNAc epitopes on WTA (18.Nathenson S.G. Strominger J.L. Enzymatic synthesis and immunochemistry of N-acetylglucosaminylribitol linkages in the teichoic acids of Staphylococcus aureus stains.J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3839-3841Google Scholar, 19.Juergens W.G. Sanderson A.R. Strominger J.L. Chemical basis for an immunological specificity of a strain of Staphylococcus aureus.J. Exp. Med. 1963; 117: 925-935Google Scholar). On the other hand, when rabbit antisera were prepared by repeated intravenous injection of heat- or phenol-killed S. aureus NYH-6 or purified cell wall components, the antibody-binding epitope of the S. aureus NYH-6 was determined to be the β-GlcNAc residues of WTA based on a hemagglutination assay (20.Morse S.I. Studies on the chemistry and immunochemistry of cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus.J. Exp. Med. 1962; 116: 229-245Google Scholar). The discrepancies between these results were explained by the specificity of the anti-WTA antibodies to various WTA types derived from the different strains used for immunization (18.Nathenson S.G. Strominger J.L. Enzymatic synthesis and immunochemistry of N-acetylglucosaminylribitol linkages in the teichoic acids of Staphylococcus aureus stains.J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3839-3841Google Scholar). Human immunization with S. aureus Copenhagen and NYH-6 strains resulted in the production of antibodies recognizing both α-GlcNAc and β-GlcNAc WTAs (21.Torii M. Kabat E.A. Bezer A.E. Separation of Teichoic Acid of Staphylococcus aureus into Two Immunologically Distinct Specific Polysaccharides with α- and β-N-Acetylglucosaminyl Linkages Respectively. Antigenicity of Theichoic Acids in Man.J. Exp. Med. 1964; 120: 13-29Google Scholar). Thus, until now, the exact epitope of S. aureus WTA and the specificity of antibodies after S. aureus infection were not clearly determined. One of the major reasons for this delay is the lack of genetic information regarding the GlcNAc transferases involved in the biosynthesis of S. aureus WTA and the difficulty of purifying WTA (specifically α-GlcNAcylated or β-GlcNAcylated WTAs) due to the absence of S. aureus mutants lacking β-GlcNAc or α-GlcNAc modifications of WTA. Recently, we purified anti-WTA IgG from human intravenous IgG (IVIG) using an affinity column coupled with WTA isolated from S. aureus strain RN4220 (22.Jung D.J. An J.H. Kurokawa K. Jung Y.C. Kim M.J. Aoyagi Y. Matsushita M. Takahashi S. Lee H.S. Takahashi K. Lee B.L. Specific serum Ig recognizing staphylococcal wall teichoic acid induces complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis against Staphylococcus aureus.J. Immunol. 2012; 189: 4951-4959Google Scholar). The purified anti-WTA IgG strongly induced activation of the classical complement pathway, leading to opsonophagocytosis of S. aureus (22.Jung D.J. An J.H. Kurokawa K. Jung Y.C. Kim M.J. Aoyagi Y. Matsushita M. Takahashi S. Lee H.S. Takahashi K. Lee B.L. Specific serum Ig recognizing staphylococcal wall teichoic acid induces complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis against Staphylococcus aureus.J. Immunol. 2012; 189: 4951-4959Google Scholar). However, the exact epitope of WTA recognized by this anti-WTA IgG has not been determined. Additionally, we reported that S. aureus WTA functions as a ligand of MBL (23.Park K.H. Kurokawa K. Zheng L. Jung D.J. Tateishi K. Jin J.O. Ha N.C. Kang H.J. Matsushita M. Kwak J.Y. Takahashi K. Lee B.L. Human serum mannose-binding lectin senses wall teichoic acid glycopolymer of Staphylococcus aureus, which is restricted in infancy.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27167-27175Google Scholar). Intriguingly, serum MBL from infants who had not yet fully developed adaptive immunity could bind to S. aureus WTA and induce complement C4 deposition. However, the exact motif used to bind WTA by human MBL is still not determined. The molecular pathways of WTA glycosylation in S. aureus were recently elucidated (24.Xia G. Maier L. Sanchez-Carballo P. Li M. Otto M. Holst O. Peschel A. Glycosylation of wall teichoic acid in Staphylococcus aureus by TarM.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13405-13415Google Scholar, 25.Brown S. Xia G. Luhachack L.G. Campbell J. Meredith T.C. Chen C. Winstel V. Gekeler C. Irazoqui J.E. Peschel A. Walker S. Methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus requires glycosylated wall teichoic acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 18909-18914Google Scholar). Two WTA glycosyltransferases, TarM and TarS, are responsible for modifying WTA with α-GlcNAc and β-GlcNAc, respectively. Furthermore, methicillin-resistance in S. aureus requires a β-GlcNAc residue of WTA, identifying the TarS enzyme as a potential new drug target molecule whose inhibition would resensitize MRSA strains to β-lactam antibiotic agents (25.Brown S. Xia G. Luhachack L.G. Campbell J. Meredith T.C. Chen C. Winstel V. Gekeler C. Irazoqui J.E. Peschel A. Walker S. Methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus requires glycosylated wall teichoic acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 18909-18914Google Scholar). Because the tarS and tarM genes have been identified, we hypothesized that if we constructed S. aureus ΔtarM or ΔtarS single or ΔtarMS double mutant cells from laboratory and highly pathogenic community-associated MRSA strains, it may be possible to determine which GlcNAc residue of WTA is recognized by serum anti-WTA IgG or MBL. Here, we report the novel findings that β-GlcNAc residues of WTA are required for the induction of the classical complement pathway-dependent opsonophagocytosis of S. aureus based on experiments with S. aureus mutant strains with altered WTA glycosylation. However, MBL recognized both α- and β-GlcNAc residues of WTA. We also found that antibodies specific to β-GlcNAc-modified WTA are major serum antibodies in humans, revealing an unexpected relationship between β-glycosylation of S. aureus WTA and host defense. We obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board of Yangsan Pusan National University Hospital specifically for this study. The infant sera were collected with permission from parents/guardians who have provided written informed consent on behalf of all child participants. For the adult sera, we also obtained written informed content from all healthy participants. Native human MBL/MBL-associated serine protease (MASP) complex was purified from human sera as described previously (26.Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. Cutting edge. Complement-activating complex of ficolin and mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease.J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Google Scholar). IgG-depleted sera were purchased from Sunnylab (Sittingbourne, UK), and MBL-deficient serum was purchased from Statens Serum Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark). S. aureus-treated serum was prepared as described previously (22.Jung D.J. An J.H. Kurokawa K. Jung Y.C. Kim M.J. Aoyagi Y. Matsushita M. Takahashi S. Lee H.S. Takahashi K. Lee B.L. Specific serum Ig recognizing staphylococcal wall teichoic acid induces complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis against Staphylococcus aureus.J. Immunol. 2012; 189: 4951-4959Google Scholar) using the S. aureus M0107 strain (Δspa), which is devoid of immunoglobulin-binding protein A. Monoclonal antibodies against human FcγRs included anti-human CD64 (clone 10.1; BioLegend), anti-human CD32 (AT10; Abcam), and anti-human CD16 (clone 3G8; BioLegend). S. aureus mutants were derivatives of strain RN4220 or USA300 are listed in Table 1. S. aureus and Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl) containing, where appropriate, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 10 μg/ml erythromycin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, or 20 μg/ml phleomycin at the appropriate temperature. In S. aureus T790 strain, the tarM gene, which encodes α-GlcNAc transferase, has been disrupted in RN4220 cells via integration of a pMutinT3 plasmid (27.Vagner V. Dervyn E. Ehrlich S.D. A vector for systematic gene inactivation in Bacillus subtilis.Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3097-3104Google Scholar) harboring the central open reading frame region of the tarM gene at the HindIII and BamHI sites, which was amplified using primers of tarM-F1 (ATGATGC GGACATACCTGCT) and tarM-R2-BamHI (CACGGATCCTAAATGCACCCGTATCATCGAA). The tarM gene in S. aureus NCTC8325 genome, a parental strain of RN4220, was reported to split into two ORFs, but our sequencing result for the RN4220 tarM locus showed one nucleotide deletion that fuses the two ORFs into one TarM ORF as in other S. aureus strains. The tarS gene encoding β-GlcNAc transferase was disrupted via integration of a pSF151 plasmid (28.Tao L. LeBlanc D.J. Ferretti J.J. Novel streptococcal-integration shuttle vectors for gene cloning and inactivation.Gene. 1992; 120: 105-110Google Scholar) harboring the central open reading frame region of the tarS gene at the BamHI and EcoRI sites, which was amplified using primers of SA0248-F-BamHI (CAACTGGATCCAAATTCTGGTGGTCCAGGT) and SA0248-R-EcoRI (TTTCGAATTCGCGTAGTGCAACAATGGTCGT). Insertion into the chromosomal tarM or tarS gene, respectively, was confirmed by PCR. To construct a plasmid pStarM harboring the intact tarM gene, the tarM gene region was amplified with primers of pStarM-F-BamHI (TGGAAAAGGGGATCCTCAATTACGATAATGC) and pStarM-R-EcoRI (AGTGAATTCAGCTGGAAGAAATGGCTAC) and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pKE515 plasmid (29.Li Y.

Genomics. 2004; 271: 447-457Google Scholar). For a tarS-harboring plasmid pStarS, TarS ORF was amplified using primers of pSA0248-F-KpnI (CAAAGTGGGAGAGGTACCATGATGAAA) and pSA0248-R2-EcoRI (AATGAATTCGAAAATGAAAATCAGGGAAATG) and cloned into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of pKE515pHU plasmid (30.Kurokawa K.

Allelic replacement in Staphylococcus aureus with inducible counter-selection.Plasmid. 2006; 55: 58-63Google Scholar). The ΔtarMΔtarS double mutant of USA300 strain was complemented with tarM or tarS by cloning the genes in the pLI50-PcadC shuttle expression vector under the control of a cadmium-inducible promoter (25.Brown S.

Briefly, WTA-bound insoluble peptidoglycan was prepared and incubated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 18 h at room temperature to release the WTA. The digested materials were centrifuged, and the WTA released in the supernatant was precipitated with acetone. The WTA fraction (∼8 mg from 20 mg of WTA-attached insoluble peptidoglycan) was further purified with HitrapQ column chromatography. Fractions containing WTA were monitored by A220 and PAGE with silver staining, and pooled fractions were evaluated for inorganic phosphate (33.Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Microdetermination of phosphorus.Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Google Scholar) and GlcNAc (34.Enghofer E. Kress H. An evaluation of the Morgan-Elson assay for 2-amino-2-deoxy sugars.Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 76: 233-238Google Scholar) after acid hydrolysis with 6 n HCl at 100 °C for 3 h in vacuo to avoid the degradation of GlcNAc residues in the oxygen. Anti-WTA IgG was affinity-purified with some modifications from commercially available human IVIG (Green Cross, Korea) using a WTA-coated nitrocellulose membrane as described recently with some modifications (23.Park K.H. Kurokawa K. Zheng L. Jung D.J. Tateishi K. Jin J.O. Ha N.C. Kang H.J. Matsushita M. Kwak J.Y. Takahashi K. Lee B.L. Human serum mannose-binding lectin senses wall teichoic acid glycopolymer of Staphylococcus aureus, which is restricted in infancy.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27167-27175Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μg of monomeric peptidoglycan-linked WTA in 200 μl of PBS was prepared from S. aureus strain T384 (RN4220 Δlgt::phleo ΔoatA::erm) as described elsewhere (23.Park K.H. Kurokawa K. Zheng L. Jung D.J. Tateishi K. Jin J.O. Ha N.C. Kang H.J. Matsushita M. Kwak J.Y. Takahashi K. Lee B.L.

Chem. 2010; 285: 27167-27175Google Scholar), spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (10 × 90 mm, Whatman, 0.45-μm pore), and baked at 100 °C for 1 h. The membranes were washed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and blocked with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% BSA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Three sheets of the membrane were incubated with 50 mg of IVIG in 40 ml of buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 1% BSA) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with buffer A, bound IgGs were eluted with 1 ml of 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.8) and immediately neutralized with 1 m KOH to pH 7.5. The glycine in the eluted IgG fraction was removed by passing the fraction through a Vivaspin 20 (Sartorius) three times in the presence of buffer A. To remove the anti-peptidoglycan IgGs, the obtained IgG fraction was incubated at 4 °C with S. aureus Δspa, ΔtagO double mutant cells that were prefixed with formaldehyde. Then the S. aureus double mutant cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected, concentrated by Vivaspin 20, and used as a purified anti-WTA IgG fraction. S. aureus Δspa mutant (M0107) that is deficient for IgG-binding protein A and its derivatives were used. To detect bound MBL, ethanol-fixed S. aureus cells (4 μl of a suspension at A600 = 3) were incubated with MBL/MASP (2–10 ng) or human serum in 20 μl of incubation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1% BSA) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with mouse anti-human MBL mAb (Dobeel, Korea; diluted 1:200), followed by goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with FITC (Beckman Coulter; diluted 1:200). Cells were appropriately washed with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20). To detect bound human IgG, S. aureus cells were incubated under conditions identical to MBL binding conditions described above, except that mouse anti-human IgG mAb (Sigma; diluted 1:200) was used as the primary antibody. To detect C4 or C3 deposition on S. aureus cells, ethanol-fixed S. aureus cells were incubated with S. aureus-treated serum (10%) with or without MBL/MASP (5–30 ng) or intact infant sera (5%) in 20 μl of incubation buffer for 20 or 60 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, S. aureus cells were incubated with IgG-depleted serum (10%) or MBL-deficient serum (10%) for 20 min at 37 °C. To detect bound C4b, mouse anti-human C4 mAb (Bioporto; diluted 1:500) was used. To detect bound C3b, mouse anti-human C3 mAb conjugated with FITC (Beckman Coulter; diluted 1:200) was used.

One purported mechanism for this phenomenon is that circulating gastrointestinal peptides modulate the functioning of the peripheral gustatory system. Recent evidence suggests endocrine signaling in the oral cavity can influence food intake (FI) and satiety. We hypothesized that these hormones may be affecting FI by influencing taste perception. We used immunohistochemistry along with genetic knockout models and the specific reconstitution of peptide YY (PYY) in saliva using gene therapy protocols to identify a role for PYY signaling in taste. We show that PYY is expressed in subsets of taste cells in murine taste buds. We also show, using brief-access testing with PYY knockouts, that PYY signaling modulates responsiveness to bitter-tasting stimuli, as well as to lipid emulsions. We show that salivary PYY augmentation, via viral vector therapy, rescues behavioral responsiveness to a lipid emulsion but not to bitter stimuli and that this response is likely mediated via activation of Y2 receptors localized apically in taste cells. Our findings suggest distinct functions for PYY produced locally in taste cells vs. that circulating systemically.—La Sala, M. S., Hurtado, M. D., Brown, A. R., Bohórquez, D. V., Liddle, R.

https://openalex.org/W2034013751,"All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is an important morphogen involved in many developmental processes, including neural differentiation, body axis formation, and organogenesis. During early embryonic development, atRA is synthesized from all-trans-retinal (atRAL) in an irreversible reaction mainly catalyzed by retinal dehydrogenase 2 (aldh1a2), whereas atRAL is converted from all-trans-retinol via reversible oxidation by retinol dehydrogenases, members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. atRA is degraded by cytochrome P450, family 26 (cyp26). We have previously identified a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 3 (dhrs3), which showed differential expression patterns in Xenopus embryos. We show here that the expression of dhrs3 was induced by atRA treatment and overexpression of Xenopus nodal related 1 (xnr1) in animal cap assay. Overexpression of dhrs3 enhanced the phenotype of excessive cyp26a1. In embryos overexpressing aldh1a2 or retinol dehydrogenase 10 (rdh10) in the presence of their respective substrates, Dhrs3 counteracted the action of Aldh1a2 or Rdh10, indicating that retinoic acid signaling is attenuated. Knockdown of Dhrs3 by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides resulted in a phenotype of shortened anteroposterior axis, reduced head structure, and perturbed somitogenesis, which were also found in embryos treated with an excess of atRA. Examination of the expression of brachyury, not, goosecoid, and papc indicated that convergent extension movement was defective in Dhrs3 morphants. Taken together, these studies suggest that dhrs3 participates in atRA metabolism by reducing atRAL levels and is required for proper anteroposterior axis formation, neuroectoderm patterning, and somitogenesis."

In this study, we describe the ability of phosphorylases to participate in the breakdown of human N-glycans, from an analysis of the substrate specificity of UhgbMP, a mannoside phosphorylase of the GH130 protein family discovered by functional metagenomics. UhgbMP is found to phosphorolyze β-d-Manp-1,4-β-d-GlcpNAc-1,4-d-GlcpNAc and is also a highly efficient enzyme to catalyze the synthesis of this precious N-glycan core oligosaccharide by reverse phosphorolysis. Analysis of sequence conservation within family GH130, mapped on a three-dimensional model of UhgbMP and supported by site-directed mutagenesis results, revealed two GH130 subfamilies and allowed the identification of key residues responsible for catalysis and substrate specificity. The analysis of the genomic context of 65 known GH130 sequences belonging to human gut bacteria indicates that the enzymes of the GH130_1 subfamily would be involved in mannan catabolism, whereas the enzymes belonging to the GH130_2 subfamily would rather work in synergy with glycoside hydrolases of the GH92 and GH18 families in the breakdown of N-glycans.

https://openalex.org/W2073072782,"Statins are some of the most commonly prescribed drugs and are used to reduce blood cholesterol. Recent evidence suggests that, in some patients, they may adversely influence cognitive function including causing memory impairments. These clinical observations have led to statin prescriptions now including a warning about possible cognitive impairments. In order to better understand the relationship between statin treatment and cognitive function, studies in animals are needed. The present study investigated the effects of chronic treatment with two statins, pravastatin and atorvastatin, in two rodent models of learning and memory. Adult rats were treated once daily with pravastatin (10mg/kg, orally) or atorvostatin (10mg/kg, orally) for 18 days. Before, during and after treatment, animals were tested in a simple discrimination and reversal learning task. On the last day of treatment and following one week withdrawal, animals were also tested in a task of novel object discrimination. Pravastatin tended to impair learning over the last few days of treatment and this effect was fully reversed once treatment ceased. In the novel object discrimination task, pravastatin significantly impaired object recognition memory. No effects were observed for atorvostatin in either task. These data suggest that chronic treatment with pravastatin impairs working and recognition memory in rodents. The reversibility of the effects on cessation of treatment is similar to what has been observed in patients, but the lack of effect of atorvostatin suggests that lipophilicity may not be a major factor influencing statin-induced cognitive impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2055088150,"Cell cycle regulation is a very accurate process that ensures cell viability and the genomic integrity of daughter cells. A fundamental part of this regulation consists in the arrest of the cycle at particular points to ensure the completion of a previous event, to repair cellular damage, or to avoid progression in potentially risky situations. In this work, we demonstrate that a reduction in nucleotide levels or the depletion of RNA polymerase I or III subunits generates a cell cycle delay at the G1/S transition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This delay is concomitant with an imbalance between ribosomal RNAs and proteins which, among others, provokes an accumulation of free ribosomal protein L5.

Eukaryotic cells tightly regulate cell cycle transitions to ensure viability and the correct transmission of genetic information.

In this work, we used the eukaryote S. cerevisiae model to investigate the effects of NTP-depleting drugs on ribosome biogenesis and their consequences on cell cycle progression. We show that these drugs also induce nucleolar stress and G1 delay in yeast through the accumulation of free r-proteins. Yeast r-proteins L11 and L5 (orthologues of human L11 and L5, respectively) appear to play an important role in this phenomenon. Therefore, we postulate that the surveillance mechanism that links ribosome integrity to cell cycle control via the induction of p53 in human cells may have evolved from a process already present in lower eukaryotes. All of the yeast strains used in this study are derivatives of the W303 and BY backgrounds. Genotypes are available in supplemental Table 1. For the experiments requiring NTP-depleting drug treatments, strains were first transformed with a centromeric plasmid that harbors the URA3 gene and then grown in a complete minimal medium lacking uracil (SC-URA). MPA and 6AU (Sigma) were dissolved directly in growth media to the indicated concentrations. Doxycycline (Sigma) was dissolved in distilled water in a concentrated stock and was added at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. To test growth, yeast cultures were diluted to the same OD600 and serial dilutions (1:10) were spotted onto plates. At least three independent experiments were carried out in all cases.

To test whether MPA-induced G1 arrest is a generally shared feature in eukaryotes, we studied the effect of NTP-depleting drugs on cell cycle progression in the model organism S. cerevisiae. First, we treated an asynchronously growing wild-type yeast culture with a sublethal dose of 6AU. As shown in Fig. 1A, this treatment led to delay in G1/S transition, and most cells became unbudded with a 1C DNA content. This G1 delay was clearly visible 2 h after adding the drug, and by 6 h after this addition, approximately 60% of cells remained unbudded with the 1C DNA content (Fig. 1A). We also tested whether 6AU promotes cell enlargement during G1 delay. Both the visual observation of cells and the forward scattering measurements in a flow cytometer showed a clear increase in cell size in the presence of 6AU (Fig. 1B). The magnitude of this increase was comparable with that which cdc mutants undergo when shifted to restrictive conditions. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with MPA (Fig. 1A; data not shown). These results suggest that the G1 delay caused by these drugs must be mediated by specific mechanisms and cannot be simply explained as a passive consequence of a growth defect due to a general transcription impairment. To further characterize the G1 delay caused by NTP-depleting drugs in yeast, a classical order-of-function analysis was performed (43.Hereford L.M. Hartwell L.H. Sequential gene function in the initiation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA synthesis.J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 84: 445-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells were arrested in START with α-factor. When cells were released from the pheromone, a significant delay took place in the presence of 6AU, indicating that the delay in G1 produced by nucleotide depletion occurred in or after the α-factor-sensitive step (START) (Fig. 1C). In the reciprocal experiment (Fig. 1D), an accumulation of wild-type unbudded G1 cells was first generated by treatment with 6AU. Further incubation of these cells in the absence of 6AU, but in the presence of α-factor, did not increase the proportion of budded cells, indicating that those cells arrested by 6AU were blocked in or before the α-factor-sensitive step. These reciprocal-shift experiments indicate that 6AU induces an accumulation of cells at START. The G1 delay described above was a transient phenomenon as wild-type cells started recovering normal cell cycle profiles at 6 h after drug addition (Fig. 1A). The reduction of intracellular NTP pools after 6AU or MPA treatment has been reported to also be transient as wild-type cells sense intracellular NTP depletion and compensate for it by inducing the transcription of IMD2. IMD2 transcript levels dramatically increase in the presence of NTP-depleting drugs during a period in which the levels of GTP and total RNA synthesis are low. The most notable induction has been observed 2 h after the drugs challenge, and at this level, it declines to the base line by 10 h after treatment (8.Shaw R.J. Reines D. Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription elongation mutants are defective in PUR5 induction in response to nucleotide depletion.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13.Escobar-Henriques M. Balguerie A. Monribot C. Boucherie H. Daignan-Fornier B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46237-46242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if the transient G1 delay correlates with the reduction in the cellular NTP pools, we could predict that the inactivation of IMD2 would lead to a more enduring cell cycle delay as loss of IMD2 suffices to manifest NTP-depleting drug sensitivity (9.Shaw R.J. Wilson J.L. Smith K.T. Reines D. Regulation of an IMP dehydrogenase gene and its overexpression in drug-sensitive transcription elongation mutants of yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32905-32916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the cells lacking IMD2 presented a continued G1 delay after 6AU or MPA treatment, which caused an increase in the 1C unbudded cells, which was still observed by 10 h after treatment. This result indicates that the G1/S transient impairment induced by these drugs correlates with the reduction in the NTP pools. To understand the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms mediating the observed G1 delay, we investigated the effect of NTP-depleting drugs on the different regulatory elements involved in the G1/S transition. First, we analyzed the consequences of NTP depletion on the expression of G1 cyclins CLN1, CLN2, and CNL3. Cells were treated for 2 h with α-factor to arrest cells at START, and then for 15 min in either the presence or absence of 6AU, but in the continuous presence of the pheromone, as schematized in Fig. 2A. Next, we released the cells from the arrest and analyzed the mRNAs levels of CLN1, CLN2, and CNL3 by Northern blotting. The CLN3 mRNA levels were clearly lower in the pheromone-treated cells in the presence of 6AU than in its absence (Fig. 2B). It should be noted that 6AU-treated cells remained arrested at G1 after removing the α-factor, which reveals that this treatment impaired G1/S transition (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the mRNA levels of ACT1, a constitutive noncycling gene, were not significantly affected after the 6AU treatment. The START-specific induction of CLN1 and CLN2 was strongly delayed until IMD2 induction overcame NTP scarcity (Fig. 2B). We also analyzed the levels of the Sic1 protein, the inhibitor of the Cdc28-Clb complexes, which regulates entry into S phase (44.Schwob E. Böhm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. The B-type cyclin kinase inhibitor p40SIC1 controls the G1 to S transition in S. cerevisiae.Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). As expected, an abnormal accumulation of Sic1 was observed in the 6AU-treated cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest the existence of a control mechanism causing the down-regulation of CLN3 expression and a subsequent delay in CLN1 and CLN2 induction. This mechanism might protect cells from the deleterious effect of replicating the genome under NTP depletion conditions. To test this scenario, we forced the entry into the S phase of NTP-depleted cells. To do so, we overexpressed CLN3 with a TET-off::CLN3 construct (negatively regulated by doxycycline and kindly provided by M. Aldea), which suppressed the accumulation of the treated cells in G1 and slightly increased 6AU sensitivity (Fig. 2D). Similar results were obtained in cells lacking Sic1 (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that the forced progression of the 6AU-treated cells into the S phase is deleterious, and, therefore, the G1 delay triggered by NTP depletion is cell-protective. As the described transient G1delay correlates with the reduction in the cellular nucleotide pools, two different scenarios can be hypothesized: (i) the low NTP levels are per se the signal for G1 delay, or (ii) a subsequent consequence of nucleotide reduction triggers the effect on cell cycle progression. To distinguish between these possibilities, we investigated the effect of 6AU on the RNA products specified by RNA pol I, II, and III. In a wild-type strain, cells were collected at different times after 6AU addition; total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 3). RNA pol I transcripts were followed by studying the steady-state levels of all pre- and mature rRNAs by Northern hybridization (Fig. 3A). A strong and early reduction in the levels of pre-rRNA 35S was observed in the cells after 15 min of 6AU treatment. The pre-rRNA 35S is the first detected precursor of rRNAs (41.Venema J. Planta R.J. Raué H.A. In vivo mutational analysis of ribosomal RNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 77: 257-270PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, this result indicates that 6AU strongly inhibits RNA pol I transcription. Consistent with this result, a similar reduction pattern was presented by other pre-rRNA species transcribed by RNA pol I; i.e. 32S, 27SA, 27SB and 20S. The levels of 27S and 20S pre-rRNAs, however, decreased more slowly than those of 35S pre-rRNA, reflecting that these are downstream precursors of the pre-rRNA processing pathway. No drop in the levels of mature 18S and 25S rRNA was observed (Fig. 3A), which most likely corresponds to pre-existing stable ribosomes in this 2-h time course of 6AU treatment. RNA pol III activity was followed by analyzing the short-life primary transcript of SUP56, which encodes a tRNALeu. The SUP56 pre-tRNA levels lowered drastically after 15 min of 6AU treatment (Fig. 3B). No drop, however, was observed in the levels of 5S rRNA which, as above, is consistent with the stability of mature ribosomes through the 2-h time course of the experiment. RNA pol II-dependent gene expression was followed by assessing the mRNA levels of r-protein genes RPL5 and RPS3 and the ribosome-unrelated ADH1 gene. In contrast to the previous results, the mRNA levels showed a very slight reduction at early time points after 6AU addition (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that, even though NTPs are essential substrates for all three RNA polymerases, the effect of NTP-depleting drugs is faster and stronger in the RNA pol I and RNA pol III transcript levels than on the RNA pol II ones (see Fig. 3D). Therefore, NTP-depleting drugs generate a clear imbalance between pre-rRNAs and mRNAs. We speculate that this imbalance might trigger the transient G1 delay observed after NTP depletion. To further explore this possibility, we reproduced the imbalance between pre-rRNAs and mRNAs through the selective depletion of essential subunits of RNA pol I or III. We first analyzed a conditional allele of RPA43 (encoding an RNA pol I subunit), which harbors this gene under the control of a TET-off promoter. In the absence of doxycycline, this strain behaves similarly to the wild type in terms of its doubling time, levels of 35S pre-rRNA, and cell cycle profile (Fig. 4, A–C). However, depletion of RPA43 clearly diminished the 35S pre-rRNA, whereas the levels of the RNA pol II RPL5 and ADH1 transcripts were not a"

Vaccines that target the blood stage of the infection are conceptually attractive because the parasite is directly exposed to the host humoral immune system, and it is this stage of the life cycle that is responsible for all the clinical symptoms of malaria (7.Miller L.H.

The blood stage is initiated when an extracellular form of the parasite called the merozoite recognizes and invades host erythrocytes. Invasion is a complex process involving multiple interactions between host erythrocyte receptors and parasite ligands displayed on the merozoite surface.

The members of the erythrocyte-binding-like family share a similar gene structure, and this homology has been used to define six regions, RI–RVI, in their ectodomains (Fig. 1A) (17.Adams J.H.

The PfEBA175 receptor, GYPA, is a dimeric type I transmembrane protein carrying 15 closely clustered O-linked tetrasaccharides capped with sialic acid/N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) (19.MacKenzie K.R.

The “Neu5Acα2–3Gal” sequence of these glycans was shown to be essential for the recognition of GYPA by PfEBA175 (21.Orlandi P.A. Klotz F.W. Haynes J.D.

Co-crystallization of the RII fragment with a structural analog of this disaccharide, α-2,3-sialyllactose, revealed six putative glycan-binding sites at the dimer interface of the parasite protein, with four of the sites located within two channels that span the dimer and another two in a deep groove accessible only through a cavity at the top of the dimer (18.Tolia N.H.

Based on the locations of the glycan-binding sites in the RII fragment, and the predominance of the monomeric form of PfEBA175 RII in solution, Tolia and co-workers (22.Batchelor J.D. Zahm J.A. Tolia N.H. Dimerization of Plasmodium vivax DBP is induced upon receptor binding and drives recognition of DARC.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 908-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have proposed a “receptor-induced dimerization model” for the erythrocyte binding of PfEBA175, which postulates monomeric PfEBA175 assembling into a dimer around the dimeric extracellular region of GYPA during invasion. This model is also consistent with recent structural studies investigating the mode of binding of the PvDBP RII to its sulfotyrosine-carrying receptor, DARC. Although studies of the 68-kDa recombinant PfEBA175 RII have proven highly informative, native PfEBA175 is a much larger protein, being synthesized as a 190-kDa membrane-tethered precursor that is proteolytically cleaved during erythrocyte invasion to release the 175-kDa extracellular region (9.Orlandi P.A.

Parasitol. 1990; 40: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because of the technical difficulties associated with expressing full-length Plasmodium proteins in a functionally active soluble recombinant form (23.Birkholtz L.M. Blatch G. Coetzer T.L. Hoppe H.C. Human E. Morris E.J. Ngcete Z. Oldfield L. Roth R. Shonhai A. Stephens L. Louw A.I. Heterologous expression of plasmodial proteins for structural studies and functional annotation.Malar. J. 2008; 7: 197Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), much of the biochemical characterization of the PfEBA175-GYPA interaction has been performed using just the RII fragment. In the study reported here, we expressed the full-length ectodomain of PfEBA175 (PfEBA175 FL) in a soluble recombinant form using a mammalian expression system. We confirmed that the recombinant protein is biochemically active and exhibited binding properties similar to those of native PfEBA175 isolated from parasite cultures. Using this protein, we investigated the biophysical parameters of the EBA175-GYPA interaction and compared them with those of the RII fragment to demonstrate that regions outside the DBL domains contributed to GYPA binding. These data have important implications for the rational design of an effective PfEBA175-based malaria vaccine. The sequence encoding the entire extracellular domain of P. falciparum (3D7) EBA175 (PfEBA175 FL) except the signal peptide (amino acids 21–1424) was made by gene synthesis (GeneART). The codons were optimized for expression in human cells, and the potential N-linked glycosylation sites were removed as described (24.Crosnier C. Bustamante L.Y. Bartholdson S.J. Bei A.K. Theron M.

His-tagged proteins were purified from the culture supernatants by affinity chromatography on HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare) using an ÄKTAxpress (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of nickel-purified proteins was carried out on a Superdex 200 Tricorn 10/600 column (GE Healthcare) in HBS-EP (HBS, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare).

Commercially available glycophorin-A preparations (catalog numbers: G7903 and A9791, Sigma) were biotinylated in vitro by incubation with a 20-fold molar excess of EZ-link sulfo-NHS-biotin (Thermo Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature and dialyzed into HBS prior to its use in the assays. When testing for immunoreactivity, proteins were immobilized with or without prior treatment at 80 °C for 10 min. Biotinylated PfEBA175 and Cd4 (negative control) were multimerized by immobilization on streptavidin-coated Nile Red fluorescent 0.4–0.6-μm microbeads (Spherotech Inc.) by incubation for 45 min at 4 °C (29.Wright G.J.

The bead arrays were then presented to erythrocytes in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates at a density of ∼3 × 105 cells/well (the ratio of cells/beads = 1:200). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with the protein arrays, the cells were washed twice in HBS + 1% BSA (HBS/BSA) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The data were acquired on an LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). Nile Red was excited by a blue laser and detected with a 575/26 filter. Forward scatter and side scatter voltages of 430 and 300 V, respectively, and a threshold of 26,100 on forward scatter were applied when analyzing erythrocytes. To test for binding specificity, the erythrocytes were pretreated with either tosylsulfonylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin from bovine pancreas (Sigma) (at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml), tosyl-lysyl chloromethyl ketone-treated chymotrypsin from bovine pancreas (Sigma) (at 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml), or 0.1 milliunit/106 cells of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (Sigma), for 1 h at 37 °C. Trypsin- and chymotrypsin-treated cells were washed once, treated with 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature, and then washed twice more before incubation with PfEBA175-coated beads. Neuraminidase-treated cells were washed twice prior to use in the binding assays. The ELISA-based AVEXIS methodology, as described previously (27.Bushell K.M. Söllner C. Schuster-Boeckler B. Bateman A. Wright G.J. Large-scale screening for novel low-affinity extracellular protein interactions.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), was adapted for detecting the interactions of recombinant PfEBA175 proteins, expressed as β-lactamase-tagged pentameric “preys” with biotinylated 'bait’ forms of purified GYPA and synthetic carbohydrate probes (GlycoTech). Briefly, the baits and the preys were normalized to activities that have previously been shown to detect transient interactions (monomeric half-lives less than 0.1 s). The biotinylated baits were immobilized on streptavidin-coated 96-well microtiter plates (NUNC) at concentrations sufficient for the complete saturation of the available binding surface/well. The plates were then washed twice in HBST and blocked with HBS/BSA for 0.5–1 h, before addition of normalized β-lactamase-tagged prey proteins and incubation for 2 h. After washes in HBST and HBS, 125 μg/ml nitrocefin, a β-lactamase substrate, was added to the wells, and its hydrolysis was monitored by absorbance measurements at 485 nm on a Pherastar plus (BMG Laboratories). All steps were performed at room temperature. Biotinylated lectins (Vector Laboratories) were immobilized on streptavidin-coated 96-well microtiter plates (NUNC) at 10 μg/ml for 1 h. The plates were then washed twice in HBST and blocked with HBS/BSA for 30 min. The immobilized lectins were next incubated with 0.02 mg/ml purified GYPA (Sigma) for 2 h. After washes in HBST, the plates were incubated with 1 μg/ml of the anti-GYPA mouse monoclonal antibody BRIC256 (Abcam) for 1 h, followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) for 30 min, before the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) at 1 mg/ml and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm on a Pherastar Plus (BMG Laboratories). All steps were performed at room temperature. SPR studies were performed on a BIAcore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 37 °C, using HBS-EP (GE Healthcare) as the running buffer. In each experiment, biotinylated baits were immobilized on streptavidin-coated sensor chips (GE Healthcare), with the negative control bait in the “reference” flow cell and an approximate molar equivalent amount of the “query” baits in the other flow cells. Purified analyte proteins were separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Tricorn 10/600 column just before their use in the SPR experiments. Increasing concentrations of these proteins were injected over the immobilized baits at 20 μl/min for equilibrium measurements and at 100 μl/min for kinetic measurements. The surfaces were regenerated with a pulse of 5 m NaCl at the end of each injection cycle. Duplicate injections of the same concentration in each experiment were superimposable, demonstrating no loss of activity after surface regeneration. Reference-subtracted sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIAcore evaluation software version 1.1.1 (GE Healthcare). To determine the overall equilibrium binding affinity, binding responses in the steady-state region of the sensorgrams (Req) were plotted against analyte concentration (C) and fitted to the following equation: Req = CRmax/(C + KD), where Rmax is the maximum binding response, and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. Kinetic constants were calculated by nonlinear regression fitting to the association and dissociation phases of the sensorgrams. To identify the mechanism of binding, the sensorgrams were globally fitted to three predefined interaction models as follows: simple 1:1 binding (A + B ↔ AB, where A is the soluble analyte and B is the immobilized ligand); conformational change (A + B ↔ AB ↔ AB*); and bivalent analyte (AA + B ↔ AAB; AAB + B ↔ AABB). Size exclusion chromatography was performed on Superose 6 10/30 (PfEBA175 FL) and Superdex 200 10/30 (PfEBA175 RII) columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in HBS (GE Healthcare) at 0.4 ml/min. The column was followed in line by a Dawn Heleos-II light scattering detector (Wyatt Technologies) and an Optilab-Rex refractive index monitor (Wyatt Technologies). Molecular mass calculations were performed using ASTRA 5.3.4.14 (Wyatt Technologies) assuming a dn/dc value of 0.186 ml/g. The 3D7 and Dd2 strains of P. falciparum were cultured in human O+ erythrocytes at 5% hematocrit in complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% human serum), under an atmosphere of 1% O2, 3% CO2, and 96% N2. Invasion assays were performed as described previously (30.Theron M. Hesketh R.L. Subramanian S. Rayner J.C. An adaptable two-color flow cytometric assay to quantitate the invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum parasites.Cytometry A. 2010; 77: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To raise polyclonal sera against PfEBA175 FL and RII, the purified proteins were injected into rabbits (Cambridge Research Biochemicals, Billingham, UK). The sera were purified on HiTrap Protein G HP columns (GE Healthcare) using an ÄKTAxpress (GE Healthcare) and dialyzed into RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) prior to their use. The anti-PfEBA175 FL and anti-PfEBA175 RII antibodies had similar anti-Cd4 activity, as determined by ELISA. An anti-AMA1 polyclonal (31.Bustamante L.Y. Bartholdson S.J. Crosnier C. Campos M.G.

The technical challenges associated with expressing full-length Plasmodium proteins in a recombinant, biochemically active form (23.Birkholtz L.M. Blatch G. Coetzer T.L. Hoppe H.C. Human E.

To investigate the biochemical properties and functional activity of a more physiologically relevant PfEBA175 protein, we took advantage of a strategy utilizing a mammalian expression system and codon-optimized gene sequences that had previously been successful for producing biochemically active Plasmodium proteins (24.Crosnier C.

In isotonic conditions, KCCs are inactive and phosphorylated, whereas hypotonicity promotes their dephosphorylation and activation. Two phosphorylation sites (Thr-991 and Thr-1048) in KCC3 have been found to be critical for its regulation. However, here we show that the double mutant KCC3-T991A/T1048A could be further activated by hypotonicity, suggesting that additional phosphorylation site(s) are involved. We observed that in vitro activated STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) complexed to its regulatory MO25 subunit phosphorylated KCC3 at Ser-96 and that in Xenopus laevis oocytes Ser-96 of human KCC3 is phosphorylated in isotonic conditions and becomes dephosphorylated during incubation in hypotonicity, leading to a dramatic increase in KCC3 function. Additionally, WNK3, which inhibits the activity of KCC3, promoted phosphorylation of Ser-96 as well as Thr-991 and Thr-1048. These observations were corroborated in HEK293 cells stably transfected with WNK3. Mutation of Ser-96 alone (KCC3-S96A) had no effect on the activity of the cotransporter when compared with wild type KCC3. However, when compared with the double mutant KCC3-T991A/T1048A, the triple mutant KCC3-S96A/T991A/T1048A activity in isotonic conditions was significantly higher, and it was not further increased by hypotonicity or inhibited by WNK3. We conclude that serine residue 96 of human KCC3 is a third site that has to be dephosphorylated for full activation of the cotransporter during hypotonicity."

Increasing evidence supports the existence of lateral heterogeneity in the plasma membrane, and many critical functions of lipid-protein interactions in cell physiology have been described (12.Lingwood D. Simons K. Lipid rafts as a membrane-organizing principle.Science. 2010; 327: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are lipid domains of the plasma membrane enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids; proteins are recruited to or segregated from lipid rafts depending on intrinsic affinity for the raft lipid environment (12.Lingwood D. Simons K. Lipid rafts as a membrane-organizing principle.Science. 2010; 327: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar). Proteins associated with lipid rafts are generally characterized by post-translational lipidation, including palmitoylation or the addition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors (13.Levental I. Grzybek M. Simons K. Greasing their way. Lipid modifications determine protein association with membrane rafts.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Transient, dynamic recruitment to lipid rafts was shown to promote assembly of active macromolecular signaling complexes, thereby contributing to the regulation of intracellular signaling efficiency and specificity (14.Gao X. Lowry P.R. Zhou X. Depry C. Wei Z. Wong G.W. Zhang J. PI3K/Akt signaling requires spatial compartmentalization in plasma membrane microdomains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Regulation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor trafficking and signaling by the caveolar/lipid raft pathway.J Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3590-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), are present in lipid rafts, but the mechanisms underlying association with these specialized membrane domains are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying association of mGluR1 with lipid rafts and examined its impact on receptor signaling. Our findings indicate that mGluR1 association with lipid rafts is transiently increased by agonist binding and is dependent on membrane cholesterol content. We found that mGluR1 harbors a putative cholesterol recognition association/interaction consensus (CRAC) motif spanning the fifth transmembrane domain (TM5) and third intracellular loop (i3) of the receptor and that specific substitutions of critical residues in the motif impair mGluR1 association with lipid rafts. Furthermore, specific mutations in the putative CRAC motif appear to inhibit agonist-induced, mGluR1-dependent activation of ERK-MAPK without affecting mGluR1 constitutive activity. Consistent with a role of cholesterol in the regulation of mGluR1 signaling efficiency, increased cholesterol levels enhance mGluR1 response to stimulation by agonist, whereas acute cholesterol depletion inhibits agonist-induced, mGluR1-dependent ERK-MAPK activation. In neurons, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) similarly inhibits group I mGluR-dependent activation of ERK-MAPK in response to agonist. Collectively, these findings reveal a function for lipid rafts and membrane cholesterol as positive allosteric modulators of group I mGluR signaling and suggest that drugs that alter membrane cholesterol (e.g. statins, cyclodextrins) or targeting the receptor-cholesterol interface could be employed to modulate abnormal group I mGluR activity in neuropsychiatric conditions, including fragile X syndrome and autism.

After brief sonication, extracts were incubated on ice for 10 min, adjusted to 40% sucrose, transferred to centrifuge tubes, and overlaid with 6 ml of 30% sucrose and 3 ml of 5% sucrose. Samples were centrifuged at 34,000 rpm for 16 h with a SW40 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter): 13 1-ml fractions were collected starting from the top of gradients. To identify lipid raft-rich membranes, equal volumes of each gradient fraction were analyzed by immunoblot to detect lipid and protein markers present in rafts (e.g. GM1, caveolin-1, flotillin-1) and proteins excluded from rafts (transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1)). Lipid raft-rich membranes (DRM fractions 2–5) were defined by enrichment in GM1, caveolin-1, and/or flotillin-1 and the absence of TfR1. Receptor abundance in DRMs relative to total was calculated from protein band densities: Σ (fractions 2–5)/Σ (fractions 1–13). All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the United States Public Health Service. Adult wild type and caveolin-1 null (Cav1−/−) mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were euthanized, and the forebrain was microdissected: ∼300 mg of tissue were homogenized in ice-cold buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 320 mm sucrose (pH.7.4) with protease inhibitors (Sigma). Homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Protein pellets were dissolved in ice-cold TNE buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, briefly sonicated, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Extracts were adjusted to 40% sucrose, transferred to centrifuge tubes, and fractionated on sucrose gradients as described for HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA) were cultured as described (17.Francesconi A. Kumari R. Zukin R.S. Regulation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor trafficking and signaling by the caveolar/lipid raft pathway.J Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3590-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) by standard procedures. To reduce glutamate in the extracellular medium, cells were washed 2 times with Krebs buffer and incubated with 2 mm pyruvate and 2 units/ml glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT; Roche Applied Science) for 2 h (23.Francesconi A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5615-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To deplete membrane cholesterol, cells were incubated with 5 mm mβCD for 1 h at 37 °C in culture medium without antibiotics; to replenish membrane cholesterol after treatment with mβCD, cells were incubated with 2.5 mm cholesterol (water soluble form) for 1 h at 37 °C. To increase membrane cholesterol content, cells were incubated with 0.1 mm cholesterol for 2 h. Primary neurons were prepared from newborn Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic, Hudson, NY) or FMR1 knock-out mouse pups (The Jackson Laboratory); for this, cells were dissociated from microdissected brain cortices by incubation with papain and gentle trituration and seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated 10-mm plates or multi-well clusters. Neurons were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 2% (v/v) B27 (Invitrogen), 2 mm GlutaMax, and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma) to prevent cell proliferation. Rat cortical neurons were used at 10–12 days in vitro for lipid raft preparation or ≥15 days in vitro for ERK assays. Mouse (≥23 days in vitro) or rat neurons were incubated for 3–4 days with lovastatin or simvastatin or vehicle; to measure ERK-MAPK activation, cells were rinsed with Krebs and incubated with 1 μm tetrodotoxin (30 min) in conditioned medium to reduce spontaneous activity, washed 2 times with Krebs, and incubated with DHPG (50 μm) for indicated times. Specificity of acute lovastatin treatment was independently monitored in control neurons incubated for 24 h with 4 μm lovastatin together with 250 μm mevalonate (not illustrated). Single or double amino acid substitutions were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II XL system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Myc-tagged mGluR1, mGluR1 mutated in caveolin-1 binding domains (17.Francesconi A. Kumari R. Zukin R.S.

Cholesterol content in total extracts and gradient fractions was measured using the Amplex Red reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Two or 5 μl of sample were used for each determination: fluorescence intensity was measured at excitation/emissions settings of 560/590 nm using a scanning fluorometer (Flexstation II; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Protein quantification, separation by SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblot, and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence were performed as previously described (17.Francesconi A. Kumari R. Zukin R.S. Regulation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor trafficking and signaling by the caveolar/lipid raft pathway.J Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3590-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Band densities were measured on digitized images using NIH Image/Image J software. The ganglioside GM1 was detected by dot-blot using cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as described (17.Francesconi A. Kumari R. Zukin R.S. Regulation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor trafficking and signaling by the caveolar/lipid raft pathway.J Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3590-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To label surface proteins with biotin, HEK293 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0) and incubated with 2 mm cell-impermeable biotin (EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin; Pierce) for 30 min at 8 °C. Cells were transferred onto ice and washed 2 times with 100 mm glycine and 1 time with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and quickly frozen. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors, sonicated, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with constant mixing. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, equal amounts of soluble proteins were incubated with NeutrAvidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. Beads were washed 4 times with PBS with 1% Triton X-100, 1 time with PBS, suspended in reducing sample buffer, and heated at 60 °C for 30 min to recover bound proteins. For ERK-MAPK assays, transfected HEK293 cells were incubated in culture medium containing 2% FBS for 5 h at 37 °C, rinsed with Krebs buffer, and incubated with GPT/pyruvate as described. Cells were rinsed two times with Krebs before stimulation with DHPG at 37 °C for indicated times; the reaction was stopped by quickly chilling cells on ice and rinsing with ice-cold PBS. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), sonicated, and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, soluble proteins were quantified and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-phospho-ERK1/2(Thr-202/Tyr-204) and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies. Transfected HEK293 cells were treated with GPT/pyruvate as described and quickly frozen at −80 °C. To prepare membranes, cells were thawed and suspended in an ice-cold buffer of 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors, disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer at 10,000 rpm for 10 s, and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min. Crude membrane pellets were washed with ice-cold buffer of 20 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), dissolved in the same buffer, divided into aliquots, and stored at −80 °C. Ligand binding assays were carried out accordingly to conditions described in Mutel et al. (24.Mutel V. Ellis G.J. Adam G. Chaboz S. Nilly A. Messer J. Bleuel Z. Metzler V. Malherbe P. Schlaeger E.J. Roughley B.S. Faull R.L. Richards J.G. Characterization of [3H]quisqualate binding to recombinant rat metabotropic glutamate 1a and 5a receptors and to rat and human brain sections.J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2590-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (∼ 25 μg per assay) were thawed, washed once, resuspended in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1, 5, 10, 30, 100 or 200 nm [3H]quisqualate; nonspecific binding was estimated by including 1 mm glutamate in control reactions. Labeled membranes were separated from unbound ligand by filtration through glass fiber filters using a cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD); filters were washed 3 times with a cold buffer of 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.3% polyethyleneimine (pH 7.4). Quisqualate affinity was calculated using GraphPad (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data are expressed as the means and S.E.; statistical significance was determined by Student's t test or ANOVA with p values < 0.05 considered significant. Lipid rafts were originally characterized and biochemically defined as a collection of buoyant membranes insoluble in cold non-ionic detergents and rich in cholesterol, Glycosphingolipids, and glycolipids (25.Simons K. Ikonen E. Functional rafts in cell membranes.Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8091) Google Scholar). Using these criteria, early studies provided evidence that proteins linked to glycosylphosphatidylinositol or modified by the addition of acyl or palmitoyl groups as well as some integral membrane proteins associated with lipid rafts. Purified membrane fractions of this kind do not equate to lipid microdomains in membranes of living cells, but they can provide the means to rapidly assess the presumptive affinity of proteins for different lipid environments (26.Lichtenberg D. Goñi F.M. Heerklotz H. Detergent-resistant membranes should not be identified with membrane rafts.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 430-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Group I mGluRs, mGluR1 and mGluR5, co-fractionate in the brain with membranes enriched in lipid raft-associated proteins and lipids (16.Burgueño J. Enrich C. Canela E.I. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R.

Regulation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor trafficking and signaling by the caveolar/lipid raft pathway.J Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3590-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, only a subset of receptors is consistently recovered in lipid raft-rich membranes, suggesting that group I mGluRs may possess low intrinsic affinity for rafts or, alternatively, that the association may be transient and/or regulated by extrinsic factors. To begin addressing these questions, we used a model cell system to examine whether mGluR1 association with lipid raft-rich membranes is affected by exposure to glutamate, the receptor physiological ligand. To this end we expressed myc-mGluR1 in HEK293 cells and examined receptor abundance in buoyant DRMs, which are enriched in lipid raft-associated proteins (e.g. caveolin-1, flotillin-1) and lipids (e.g. GM1, cholesterol) but depleted of proteins normally excluded from rafts (e.g. TfR1) (17.Francesconi A.

Francesconi A. Identification of GPCR localization in detergent-resistant membranes.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 746: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To measure the abundance of myc-mGluR1 in DRMs in the near absence of glutamate, transfected cells were incubated with GPT/pyruvate to rapidly convert free glutamate to α-ketoglutarate, a procedure that effectively reduces extracellular glutamate to trace levels (27.Prézeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. Changes in the carboxyl-terminal domain of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 by alternative splicing generate receptors with differing agonist-independent activity.Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar). DRMs were isolated from cells treated with GPT/pyruvate alone (basal conditions) or subsequently incubated with 1 mm glutamate for 2, 5, and 20 min. Under basal conditions, ∼5% of total mGluR1 was present in DRMs (Fig. 1, A and B). Application of glutamate increased the abundance of myc-mGluR1 in DRMs that was maximal at 5 min and declined to basal level upon prolonged exposure to agonist (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, application of glutamate did not significantly alter the abundance in DRMs of the lipid raft-associated proteins Gαq/11 and caveolin-1 (Fig. 1C) or the distribution of transferrin receptor 1 (Fig. 1C), attesting to the specificity of the effect of glutamate on mGluR1. To test whether incubation with agonist produced a similar change in recruitment to li"

In this study, we demonstrated that HDAC3 undergoes unconventional splicing during stem cell differentiation. Four different splicing variants have been identified, designated as HD3α, -β, -γ, and -δ, respectively. HD3α was confirmed in stem cell differentiation by specific antibody against the sequences from intron 12. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that the HD3α isoform co-localized with CD31-positive or α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells at different developmental stages of mouse embryos. Overexpression of HD3α reprogrammed human aortic endothelial cells into mesenchymal cells featuring an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) phenotype. HD3α directly interacts with HDAC3 and Akt1 and selectively activates transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2) secretion and cleavage. TGFβ2 functioned as an autocrine and/or paracrine EndMT factor. The HD3α-induced EndMT was both PI3K/Akt- and TGFβ2-dependent. This study provides the first evidence of the role of HDAC3 splicing in the maintenance of endothelial integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2031637307,"Background Oxidative stress is one of the major factors that trigger photoreceptor apoptosis. To investigate whether resveratrol, a potent antioxidant and small molecule activator of the FoxO pathway, would be neuroprotective against photoreceptor cell death in a rodent model of retinal detachment. Methods Retinal detachment was created in adult Brown Norway rats by subretinal injection of sodium hyaluronate. The animals were treated daily with vehicle or resveratrol (20mg/kg) intraperitoneal injection. Photoreceptor death was assessed by counting the number of apoptotic cells with TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and measurement of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness 3 days after RD. Changes in expression of FoxO1a, FoxO3a, and FoxO4 were analyzed by western blot. The activity of caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, spectrin and their cleavage forms were studied. Results Three days after retinal detachment, caspase 3, caspase 8 and caspase 9 were significantly activated in the detached retina. Spectrin cleavage products at 120 and 145 kDa were also detected. Both caspase and calpain activation are involved in apoptotic photoreceptor cell death in detached retinas. Treatment with resveratrol increases FoxO1a, FoxO3a, and FoxO4 protein expression in detached retinas only. Resveratrol treatment decreases activation of intrinsic and extrinsic caspase apoptotic pathways triggered by RD. The number of TUNEL-positive cells decreases from 1301±51 cells/mm2 in control groups to 430±35 cells/mm2 in treatment groups (p<0.05). Resveratrol treatment also demonstrates 59% less ONL thickness loss compared to controls. Conclusions Resveratrol treatment up-regulates the FoxO family and blocks Caspase3, 8, and 9 activation. Resveratrol has the potential to be used as a novel therapeutic agent for preventing vision loss in diseases characterized by photoreceptor detachment."
https://openalex.org/W1990814651,"Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase expressed in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. Previously, we characterized the functions of Jak3 in cytoskeletal remodeling, epithelial wound healing, and mucosal homeostasis. However, the role of Jak3 in mucosal differentiation and inflammatory bowel disease was not known. In this report, we characterize the role of Jak3 in mucosal differentiation, basal colonic inflammation, and predisposition toward colitis. Using the Jak3 knock-out (KO) mouse model, we show that Jak3 is expressed in colonic mucosa of mice, and the loss of mucosal expression of Jak3 resulted in reduced expression of differentiation markers for the cells of both enterocytic and secretory lineages. Jak3 KO mice showed reduced expression of colonic villin, carbonic anhydrase, secretory mucin muc2, and increased basal colonic inflammation reflected by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17A in colon along with increased colonic myeloperoxidase activity. The inflammations in KO mice were associated with shortening of colon length, reduced cecum length, decreased crypt heights, and increased severity toward dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. In differentiated human colonic epithelial cells, Jak3 redistributed to basolateral surfaces and interacted with adherens junction (AJ) protein β-catenin. Jak3 expression in these cells was essential for AJ localization of β-catenin and maintenance of epithelial barrier functions. Collectively, these results demonstrate the essential role of Jak3 in the colon where it facilitated mucosal differentiation by promoting the expression of differentiation markers and enhanced colonic barrier functions through AJ localization of β-catenin."

These parasite-induced structures are implicated in the transport of nutrients, metabolic products, and parasite proteins, as well as in parasite virulence. However, very few of the parasite effector proteins that underlie remodeling of the host erythrocyte are functionally characterized. Using bioinformatic examination and modeling, we have found that the exported P. falciparum protein PFA0210c belongs to the START domain family, members of which mediate transfer of phospholipids, ceramide, or fatty acids between membranes.

Significance: Identification of the function of conserved Plasmodium proteins allows deeper insight into the basis of pathogenesis. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a disease that claims nearly one million lives each year (1.World Health Organization (2011) World Malaria Report 2011, Geneva, Switzerland.Google Scholar, 2.Murray C.J.

All symptoms of malaria result from infection of erythrocytes by the parasite, so investigating interactions between the parasite and its host cell is of great importance to understanding of the disease. The parasite actively invades the erythrocyte and comes to rest within a membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuole (PV). 3The abbreviations used are: PVparasitophorous vacuolePVMPV membraneSTARTsteroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transferPEphosphatidylethanolaminePIphosphatidylinositolPCphosphatidylcholineMBPmaltose-binding proteinPDBProtein Data BankPITPrat phosphatidylinositol transfer protein αNTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. The intracellular parasite develops into a trophozoite, which replicates asexually by a process called schizogony, gradually expanding to fill an increasing proportion of the host cell volume. Eventually, at ∼48 h post-invasion, the schizont undergoes segmentation to produce 16–32 progeny merozoites that are released upon rupture of the infected cell to repeat the cycle. parasitophorous vacuole PV membrane steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylcholine maltose-binding protein Protein Data Bank rat phosphatidylinositol transfer protein α nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. The parasitized erythrocyte undergoes a range of dramatic structural changes during parasite growth, including alterations to its deformability, membrane permeability, and cytoadhesive properties (3.Cooke B.M. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. The malaria-infected red blood cell. Structural and functional changes.Adv. Parasitol. 2001; 50: 1-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Throughout its intracellular life cycle the parasite remains surrounded by the PV membrane (PVM), which therefore has to expand to accommodate the growing parasite. The parasite also induces the formation of additional membranous compartments within the cytosol of the infected erythrocyte beyond the PV, including Maurer clefts, which are important for the assembly of the surface-exposed knobs (4.Kriek N. Tilley L. Horrocks P. Pinches R. Elford B.C. Ferguson D.J. Lingelbach K. Newbold C.I. Characterization of the pathway for transport of the cytoadherence-mediating protein, PfEMP1, to the host cell surface in malaria parasite-infected erythrocytes.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that alter the adhesive properties of the erythrocyte, and the tubovesicular network, which plays an important role in nutrient import (5.Lauer S.A. Rathod P.K. Ghori N. Haldar K. A membrane network for nutrient import in red cells infected with the malaria parasite.Science. 1997; 276: 1122-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two different types of mobile vesicles have been identified in infected erythrocytes; the highly mobile vesicles (6.Hibbs A.R. Saul A.J. Plasmodium falciparum, highly mobile small vesicles in the malaria-infected red blood cell cytoplasm.Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the J-dots (7.Külzer S. Rug M. Brinkmann K. Cannon P. Cowman A. Lingelbach K. Blatch G.L. Maier A.G. Przyborski J.M.

Microbiol. 2010; 12: 1398-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These structures may also have a role in the transport of parasite proteins throughout the erythrocyte. However, no parasite protein that might play a role in assembling the PVM and other induced membrane structures in the parasite-infected erythrocyte has been identified. A large set of parasite proteins is known to be exported beyond the parasite plasma membrane and the PVM into the host erythrocyte (8.Maier A.G. Cooke B.M. Cowman A.F. Tilley L. Malaria parasite proteins that remodel the host erythrocyte.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Identification of these proteins was aided by the discovery of a distinct export motif, the HT (or PEXEL) motif (9.Hiller N.L. Bhattacharjee S. van Ooij C. Liolios K. Harrison T. Lopez-Estraño C.

Based on this motif it has been predicted that between 422 (11.van Ooij C. Tamez P. Bhattacharjee S. Hiller N.L. Harrison T. Liolios K. Kooij T. Ramesar J. Balu B. Adams J. Waters A.P. Waters A.

Simpson K. Speed T.P. Cowman A.F. Lineage-specific expansion of proteins exported to erythrocytes in malaria parasites.Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R12Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) proteins are exported. The upper figure may be a conservative estimate as it has recently been recognized that several exported proteins do not contain the HT/PEXEL motif (13.Spielmann T. Gilberger T.W. Protein export in malaria parasites: do multiple export motifs add up to multiple export pathways?.Trends Parasitol. 2010; 26: 6-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but may be exported through the same common pathway (14.Grüring C.

Microbiol. 2013; 87: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Hence the total number of exported parasite proteins likely exceeds these estimates. Exported P. falciparum proteins may be divided into three categories. The first comprises species-specific proteins, which likely have roles specific for P. falciparum and probably mediate specific aspects of its pathogenicity. The best studied of these is PfEMP1, the main component of the knob structures at the surface of the parasitized erythrocyte that are required for vascular sequestration. The second category comprises host-specific exported proteins, which are found only in Plasmodium species that infect humans and likely play roles in the interaction with the host. A third category comprises several exported proteins that are found in all sequenced Plasmodium species (11.van Ooij C. Tamez P. Bhattacharjee S. Hiller N.L. Harrison T. Liolios K. Kooij T.

These likely perform important, conserved functions in the interaction of the parasite with the host cell and may represent the basic machinery that allows the parasite to survive inside the erythrocyte. However, the absence of obvious sequence similarity between exported malarial proteins and proteins in the databases means that the biochemical function of most of the exported parasite proteins is unknown. Here we describe an investigation of the P. falciparum protein PFA0210c (current PlasmoDB ID PF3D7_0104200), previously identified by us (9.Hiller N.L. Bhattacharjee S. van Ooij C. Liolios K.

Using bioinformatic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that PFA0210c is a member of the family of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain-containing phospholipid transfer proteins. We show that PFA0210c is expressed during the asexual intraerythrocytic life cycle, associates with membranes, and has the capacity to transfer phospholipids between phospholipid vesicles. Gene fragments of PFA0210c, PKH_020910, and PCHAS_020730 were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The resulting fragments were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into pMAL c2x (New England Biolabs) that had been digested with EcoRI and SalI. The resulting plasmids encode a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (MBP) at the N terminus and a C-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag. Point mutations were produced by overlapping PCR using the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The PCR fragments were fused in a second PCR step using both amplicons as templates in conjunction with external primers (supplemental Table S1). The resulting DNA was further amplified with primers CVO022 and CVO023 and cloned into pMAL c2x as described above. An additional 5′ sequence was added by cloning the EcoRV-BsrGI fragment from pBLD368 into the resulting plasmids. Recombinant proteins were purified as MBP-His6 fusions from Escherichia coli BL21. Protein production was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) to bacterial cultures, which were then grown overnight at 18 °C. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation, followed by suspension in high salt MBP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free Mixture, Roche Applied Science) and lysed with a Cell Disruptor (Constant Cell Disruption System). The lysate was sonicated for three cycles of 30 s, setting 4, 50% duty cycle with a microtip (Vibracell, Sonics and Materials, Inc.) and subsequently centrifuged twice in an Oakridge tube at 9,000 × g for 30 min in a JA25.5 rotor. The supernatant was then transferred to a 50-ml conical tube containing 0.5–1.0 ml of Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen), and mixed at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was transferred to a 1.5 × 12-cm chromatography column (Bio-Rad), washed with ∼100 column volumes of high salt MBP buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, then bound protein was eluted with 10 ml of high salt MBP buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. For the time course and titration experiments, the Ni2+-NTA eluate was polished by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep-grade column equilibrated in standard assay buffer (10 mm HEPES-Na+, 1 mm EDTA-Na+, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Peak protein fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and concentrated using a 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off Vivaspin 15 concentrator (Sartorium Stedim Biotech). The protein concentration was determined using a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific) and the concentrated protein was stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks without a noticeable decrease in activity. To purify recombinant proteins used for the remaining transfer assays, the Ni2+-NTA eluate was added to ∼1 ml of amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with agitation. The resin was poured into a 1.5 × 12-cm chromatography column (Bio-Rad), washed with ∼100 column volumes of MBP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl), and bound protein was eluted with 10 ml of MBP buffer containing 50 mm maltose. The eluate was dialyzed against standard assay buffer (10 mm HEPES-Na, 1 mm EDTA-Na, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Thermo Scientific) with a molecular mass cut-off of 20,000 Da. The protein was subsequently concentrated and the concentration was established as described above. The proteins were divided into aliquots, snap frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath, and stored at −80 °C. After thawing, the proteins were stored at 4 °C and used for up to 2 weeks. MBP-LacZ was purified similar to MBP-PFA0210c-His6, except that the bacterial lysate, after centrifugation, was loaded directly onto amylose resin and the protein was dialyzed against PBS using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Thermo Scientific). It was then concentrated and frozen as described for MBP-PFA0210c-His6. Rat phosphatidylinositol transfer protein α (PITP) was purified as described previously (16.Tremblay J.M. Helmkamp G.M. Yarbrough L.R. Limited proteolysis of rat phosphatidylinositol transfer protein by trypsin cleaves the C terminus, enhances binding to lipid vesicles, and reduces phospholipid transfer activity.J.

Monoclonal antibodies 24C6.1F1 (a kind gift of Jean-Francois Dubremetz, University of Montpellier 2) and X509, reactive with P. falciparum proteins SERA5 and MSP1, respectively, have been described previously (18.Blackman M.J.

To detect the HA epitope on Western blots, mAb 3F10 was used. The anti-PFA0210c monoclonal antibody (mAb) NIMP.M11 (subclass IgG1 as determined by Ouchterlony assay) was produced using splenic B cells obtained from BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant protein MBP-PFA0210c-His6 purified as described above. The cells were fused with Sp2/0/Ag14 myeloma cells and cloned by limiting dilution using standard procedures, screening cell supernatants by dot blot against a glutathione S-transferase-PFA0210c fusion protein that had been purified from E. coli on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Undiluted hybridoma supernatant was used for Western blots. To obtain parasite extract over the course of one intraerythrocytic cycle, six small flasks containing a low hematocrit (∼1%) infected at a high parasitemia (∼20–30%) with P. falciparum clone 3D7 in 10 ml of RPMI containing Albumax were set up. To ensure that the parasites were synchronized, the erythrocytes were infected with Percoll-purified schizonts for 1 h. After this period, residual schizonts were removed on a Percoll gradient and any remaining schizonts were lysed by treatment with 5% (w/v) sorbitol. At the indicated time points a culture was pelleted by centrifugation, and transferred to two microcentrifuge tubes, washed once with 900 μl of PBS and stored at −80 °C. For Western blot analysis, each sample was solubilized directly into 200 μl of 1.2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer and fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond-C Extra, GE Healthcare) and detected using the anti-PFA0210c mAb NIMP.M11, an HRP-linked secondary anti-mouse antibody, and a chemiluminescence developing system (Immobilon Western Chemiluminuescent HRP substrate, Millipore). pBLD390 was produced by amplifying the 5′ and 3′ regions of PFA0210c by PCR with primer pairs CVO001 and CVO002 and CVO024 and CVO023, respectively. The His6-HA3-GFP module was amplified from a version of pHH1SERA5chimWT (20.Collins C.R. Hackett F. Strath M. Penzo M. Withers-Martinez C. Baker D.A. Blackman M.J.

The three fragments were joined in one PCR using primers CVO001 and CVO023. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into pGEM-T according to the supplier's instructions and subsequently cloned into pBLD210 (11.van Ooij C. Tamez P. Bhattacharjee S. Hiller N.L. Harrison T.

From algorithms to essential function in blood stage infection.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000084Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). pBLD397 was produced by amplifying PFA0210c and 1938 bases of its upstream flanking (promoter) region using primers CVO030 and CVO023. The resulting fragment was cloned into pGEM-T according to the supplier's instructions. The His6-HA3-GFP module was introduced into the resulting plasmid by transferring a BstZ17I fragment and a BstZ17I-XhoI fragment from pBLD390. The resulting fusion was subsequently cloned into pA289 (a kind gift of Andrew Osborne) from which the SalI-CelII fragment, containing the calmodulin promoter, was removed using SpeI and XhoI. PfBLD390 was created by transfecting schizonts of P. falciparum strain 3D7 with pBLD390 according to the protocol described by Moon et al. (21.Moon R.W. Hall J. Rangkuti F. Ho Y.S. Almond N.

Methods. 2006; 3: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected with WR99210 in the case of PfBLD390 and blasticidin in the case of PfBLD397. Percoll-enriched schizonts that had been frozen at −80 °C were thawed directly into hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors. The lysate was incubated on ice for 90 min with occasional agitation, then divided into two aliquots and centrifuged at ∼100,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge using a TLA100.3 rotor. The supernatants containing soluble extract proteins were retained and the pellets were washed twice with hypotonic lysis buffer. Pellets then were resuspended in 0.7 ml of high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl) by trituration and incubated on ice for a further 30 min. The samples were centrifuged as before, the supernatants were transferred to a new tube (this represents the membrane-associated fraction), and the pellets were resuspended in carbonate buffer (0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11) by trituration. The samples were kept on ice and centrifuged as before. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the pellet was resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the proteins transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Biosciences). PFA0210c was detected using mAb NIMP.M11 and SERA5 was detected in parallel using the anti-SERA5 mAb 24C6.1F1. The anti-SERA5 blot was stripped with 5% acetic acid and reprobed with the anti-MSP1 mAb X509. Streptolysin O treatment of infected erythrocytes was performed as described (23.Ansorge I. Benting J.

Protein-catalyzed phospholipid exchange between gel and liquid-crystalline phospholipid vesicles.Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), except that the volume was reduced to 100 μl and the final spin was repeated to reduce the carry-over of pelleted vesicles. Radioactive l-[α-dipalmitoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine and choline-[methyl-3H]sphingomylein (egg) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Association of cellular lipids with the PITP proteins was analyzed using a modification of a previously published protocol (25.Ségui B. Allen-Baume V. Cockcroft S.

In brief, HL60 cells (50 ml) were labeled with 1 μCi/ml of [14C]acetate in RPMI 1640 medium for 48 h. The cells were permeabilized with streptolysin O and the leaked cytosol removed by centrifugation. 200 μl of permeabilized cells (∼107 cells) were incubated with 50 μg of recombinant protein or a control protein (100 μl) for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+-ATP and 200 μl of liposomes (PC:PI, 98:2 mol/mol, 160 μg of total lipid). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of ice-cold 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.25 m sucrose (pH 5.0). The tubes were vortexed and left on ice for 10 min to aggregate the membranes. Following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, 500 μl of supernatant from each reaction was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and further centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a benchtop ULTRA centrifuge for 1 h to remove any cellular debris. At the end of the incubation, 400 μl of the supernatant was sampled and the lipids were extracted and resolved by analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) developed in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (75:45:3:1, by volume). The TLC plates were imaged between 2 and 3 days using Fuji phosphorimaging screens and data were quantified by densitometry using AIDA software. Results are expressed as a percentage of the total input count. Error bars indicate mean ± S.D. 14C-Labeled phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine were purified from HL60 cells grown in [14C]acetate for 72 h.

Although mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to effectively attenuate various injured tissues, there is limited information regarding a role for amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs) in treating acute lung injury. We hypothesized that intravenous delivery of AFSCs would attenuate lung injury in an experimental model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. AFSCs were isolated from EGFP transgenic mice. The in vitro differentiation, surface markers, and migration of the AFSCs were assessed by specific staining, flow cytometry, and a co-culture system, respectively. The in vivo therapeutic potential of AFSCs was evaluated in a model of acute hyperoxia-induced lung injury in mice. The administration of AFSCs significantly reduced the hyperoxia-induced pulmonary inflammation, as reflected by significant reductions in lung wet/dry ratio, neutrophil counts, and the level of apoptosis, as well as reducing the levels of inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and early-stage fibrosis in lung tissues. Moreover, EGFP-expressing AFSCs were detected and engrafted into a peripheral lung epithelial cell lineage by fluorescence microscopy and DAPI stain. Intravenous administration of AFSCs may offer a new therapeutic strategy for acute lung injury (ALI), for which efficient treatments are currently unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W1982554168,"Fragile site breakage was previously shown to result in rearrangement of the RET oncogene, resembling the rearrangements found in thyroid cancer. Common fragile sites are specific regions of the genome with a high susceptibility to DNA breakage under conditions that partially inhibit DNA replication, and often coincide with genes deleted, amplified, or rearranged in cancer. While a substantial amount of work has been performed investigating DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint proteins vital for maintaining stability at fragile sites, little is known about the initial events leading to DNA breakage at these sites. The purpose of this study was to investigate these initial events through the detection of aphidicolin (APH)-induced DNA breakage within the RET oncogene, in which 144 APH-induced DNA breakpoints were mapped on the nucleotide level in human thyroid cells within intron 11 of RET, the breakpoint cluster region found in patients. These breakpoints were located at or near DNA topoisomerase I and/or II predicted cleavage sites, as well as at DNA secondary structural features recognized and preferentially cleaved by DNA topoisomerases I and II. Co-treatment of thyroid cells with APH and the topoisomerase catalytic inhibitors, betulinic acid and merbarone, significantly decreased APH-induced fragile site breakage within RET intron 11 and within the common fragile site FRA3B. These data demonstrate that DNA topoisomerases I and II are involved in initiating APH-induced common fragile site breakage at RET, and may engage the recognition of DNA secondary structures formed during perturbed DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2027343313,"Background Most previous studies on reliance on social benefits have focused on health, sickness absence, work environment and socioeconomic status in adulthood. Extending the focus to include early life circumstances may improve our understanding of processes leading to educational and occupational marginalisation and exclusion. The aim of this study was to investigate if multiple negative life events in childhood determined future labour market participation, and to identify important negative life events for labour market participation in young adulthood. Methods Of a cohort of 3,681 born in 1989 in the county of Ringkjoebing, Denmark, 3,058 (83%) completed a questionnaire in 2004. They were followed in a register on social benefits for 12 months in 2010-2011. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associations between negative life events in childhood and future labour market participation, taking into account effects of socio-economic position, school performance, educational plans, vocational expectations and general health. Results A total of 17.1% (19.9% males, 14.4% females) received social benefits for at least 4 weeks during follow-up. Labour market participation decreased with number of negative life events, especially for females: Females who had experienced their parents’ divorce, had been abused, or had witnessed a violent event, showed decreased labour market participation, when adjusting for SES, school performance, educational plans, vocational expectations and general health at baseline. Attributable fractions ranged from 2.4% (parents’ alcohol/drug abuse) to 16.1% (parents’ divorce) for women. For men, risk estimates were lower and insignificant in the most adjusted models. Attributable fractions ranged from 1.0% (parents’ alcohol/drug abuse) to 4.9% for witnessing a violent event. Conclusions Information on childhood conditions may increase the understanding of determinants of labour market participation for young adults. Knowledge of negative life events in childhood should be taken into account when considering determinants of labour market participation and identifying high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W1981815854,"Components of (co)variance and genetic parameters were estimated for adjusted weights at ages 120 (W120), 240 (W240), 365 (W365) and 450 (W450) days of Polled Nellore cattle raised on pasture and born between 1987 and 2010. Analyses were performed using an animal model, considering fixed effects: herd-year-season of birth and calf sex as contemporary groups and the age of cow as a covariate. Gibbs Samplers were used to estimate (co)variance components, genetic parameters and additive genetic effects, which accounted for great proportion of total variation in these traits. High direct heritability estimates for the growth traits were revealed and presented mean 0.43, 0.61, 0.72 and 0.67 for W120, W240, W365 and W450, respectively. Maternal heritabilities were 0.07 and 0.08 for W120 and W240, respectively. Direct additive genetic correlations between the weight at 120, 240, 365 and 450 days old were strong and positive. These estimates ranged from 0.68 to 0.98. Direct-maternal genetic correlations were negative for W120 and W240. The estimates ranged from -0.31 to -0.54. Estimates of maternal heritability ranged from 0.056 to 0.092 for W120 and from 0.064 to 0.096 for W240. This study showed that genetic progress is possible for the growth traits we studied, which is a novel and favorable indicator for an upcoming and promising Polled Zebu breed in Tropical regions. Maternal effects influenced the performance of weight at 120 and 240 days old. These effects should be taken into account in genetic analyses of growth traits by fitting them as a genetic or a permanent environmental effect, or even both. In general, due to a medium-high estimate of environmental (co)variance components, management and feeding conditions for Polled Nellore raised at pasture in tropical regions of Brazil needs improvement and growth performance can be enhanced."
https://openalex.org/W2145391935,"Activation of Rap1 GTPase can improve the integrity of the barrier of the retina pigment epithelium (RPE) and reduce choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation also reduces CNV. We hypothesize that Rap1 inhibits NADPH oxidase-generated ROS and thereby reduces CNV formation. Using a murine model of laser-induced CNV, we determined that reduced Rap1 activity in RPE/choroid occurred with CNV formation and that activation of Rap1 by 2'-O-Me-cAMP (8CPT)-reduced laser-induced CNV via inhibiting NADPH oxidase-generated ROS. In RPE, inhibition of Rap1 by Rap1 GTPase-activating protein (Rap1GAP) increased ROS generation, whereas activation of Rap1 by 8CPT reduced ROS by interfering with the assembly of NADPH oxidase membrane subunit p22phox with NOX4 or cytoplasmic subunit p47phox. Activation of NADPH oxidase with Rap1GAP reduced RPE barrier integrity via cadherin phosphorylation and facilitated choroidal EC migration across the RPE monolayer. Rap1GAP-induced ROS generation was inhibited by active Rap1a, but not Rap1b, and activation of Rap1a by 8CPT in Rap1b(-/-) mice reduced laser-induced CNV, in correlation with decreased ROS generation in RPE/choroid. These findings provide evidence that active Rap1 reduces CNV by interfering with the assembly of NADPH oxidase subunits and increasing the integrity of the RPE barrier."
https://openalex.org/W1993644204,"Both Ang-2 and VEGFR-3 are major regulators of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, respectively, and thus may affect prognosis of OSCC. We sought to determine the associations between Ang-2 and VEGFR-3 expression and survival of OSCC.Ang-2 and VEGFR-3 expression was determined immunohistochemically in tumor tissues from 112 patients with OSCC; OSCC-adjacent noncancerous oral tissue from 85 OSCC patients; and normal oral mucosa from 37 cancer-free individuals. A log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare survival among different groups with expression of Ang-2 and VEGFR-3.Ang-2 and VEGFR-3 expression was upregulated in OSCC compared to nontumor tissue (all P<0.05). High Ang-2 expression positively correlated with microvessel density (MVD) (P<0.01), and high VEGFR-3 expression positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (P<0.01) and lymphatic vessel density (LVD) (P<0.01). The patients with high expression of Ang-2 alone or in combination with VEGFR-3 had a significantly worse survival than in patients with low expression of Ang-2 or any other co-expression status (all P<0.05), respectively. Furthermore, multivariable analysis showed that patients with high expression of Ang-2 alone or in combination with VEGFR-3 had a significantly increased risk of death compared with those with low expression of Ang-2 or any other co-expression status (HR, 2.7, 95% CI, 1.1-6.2 and 5.0, 1.3-15.4, respectively).These results suggest that increased expression in tumors of Ang-2 may individually, or in combination with VEGFR-3, predict poor prognosis of OSCC."

This complex is a multifunctional complex acting as a prolyl 3-hydroxylase, a peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase, and a molecular chaperone. Two major domains are predicted from the primary sequence of P3H1: an amino-terminal domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain corresponding to the 2-oxoglutarate- and iron-dependent dioxygenase domains similar to the α-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylases. The amino-terminal domain contains four CXXXC sequence repeats. The primary sequence of cartilage-associated protein is homologous to the amino-terminal domain of P3H1 and also contains four CXXXC sequence repeats. However, the function of the CXXXC sequence repeats is not known.

Several publications have reported that short peptides containing a CXC or a CXXC sequence show oxido-reductase activity similar to PDI in vitro. We hypothesize that CXXXC motifs have oxido-reductase activity similar to the CXXC motif in PDI. We have tested the enzyme activities on model substrates in vitro using a GCRALCG peptide and the P3H1 complex. Our results suggest that this complex could function as a disulfide isomerase in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Background: The function of the CXXXC motifs in P3H1 and CRTAP has not been previously characterized. Results: The model GCRALCG peptide and the P3H1·CRTAP·CypB complex show disulfide isomerase activity in vitro. Conclusion: Our results suggest that this complex could function as a disulfide isomerase. Significance: This indicates an additional function of the P3H1 complex in the rER."
https://openalex.org/W1964512622,"The mammalian Peg3 domain harbors more than 20 evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) that are spread over the 250-kb genomic interval. The majority of these ECRs are marked with two histone modifications, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, suggesting potential roles as distant regulatory elements for the transcription of the nearby imprinted genes. In the current study, the chromatin conformation capture (3C) method was utilized to detect potential interactions of these ECRs with the imprinted genes. According to the results, one region, ECR18, located 200-kb upstream of Peg3 interacts with the two promoter regions of Peg3 and Zim2. The observed interaction is most prominent in brain, but was also detected in testis. Histone modification and DNA methylation on ECR18 show no allele bias, implying that this region is likely functional on both alleles. In vitro assays also reveal ECR18 as a potential enhancer or repressor for the promoter of Peg3. Overall, these results indicate that the promoters of several imprinted genes in the Peg3 domain interact with one evolutionarily conserved region, ECR18, and further suggest that ECR18 may play key roles in the transcription and imprinting control of the Peg3 domain as a distant regulatory element."

It has also been linked to immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Here, we examined the role and mechanism of action of SAP in autoimmunity using a mouse model of autoimmune arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We found that SAP was essential for development of CIA in response to collagen immunization. It was also required for production of collagen-specific antibodies, which play a key role in disease pathogenesis. These effects required SAP expression in T cells, not in B cells. In mice immunized with a high dose of collagen, the activity of SAP was nearly independent of its ability to bind the protein tyrosine kinase Fyn and correlated with the capacity of SAP to promote full differentiation of follicular T helper (TFH) cells. However, with a lower dose of collagen, the role of SAP was more dependent on Fyn binding, suggesting that additional mechanisms other than TFH cell differentiation were involved. Further studies suggested that this might be due to a role of the SAP-Fyn interaction in natural killer T cell development through the ability of SAP-Fyn to promote Vav-1 activation. We also found that removal of SAP expression during progression of CIA attenuated disease severity. However, it had no effect on disease when CIA was clinically established.

Although SAP is not needed for early TFH cell differentiation (also called “polarization”), it is required for completion of this process by enabling up-regulated expression of the TFH cell lineage commitment factor Bcl-6 (28.Choi Y.S. Kageyama R. Eto D. Escobar T.C. Johnston R.J. Monticelli L. Lao C. Crotty S.

SAP has been implicated in autoimmune diseases, in particular diseases associated with autoantibodies such as lupus (1.Schwartzberg P.L. Mueller K.L. Qi H. Cannons J.L. SLAM receptors and SAP influence lymphocyte interactions, development and function.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2.Veillette A. Dong Z. Latour S.

Immunol. 2008; 97: 177-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Constitutive SAP deficiency dramatically reduced the susceptibility of mice to pristane-induced lupus (29.Hron J.D. Caplan L. Gerth A.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Peng S.L. SH2D1A regulates T-dependent humoral autoimmunity.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This effect was associated with a pronounced reduction of autoantibody production. Likewise, a spontaneous germ line mutation in the SAP-encoding gene reduced the severity of lupus-associated glomerulonephritis and vasculitis in mice carrying a mutation of Fas (30.Komori H. Furukawa H. Mori S. Ito M.R. Terada M. Zhang M.C. Ishii N. Sakuma N. Nose M. Ono M. A signal adaptor SLAM-associated protein regulates spontaneous autoimmunity and Fas-dependent lymphoproliferation in MRL-Faslpr lupus mice.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Lastly, lack of SAP attenuated enhanced GC formation, high levels of autoantibodies, and lupus-like renal pathology in mice carrying the Sanroque mutation (31.Linterman M.A. Rigby R.J. Wong R.K. Yu D. Brink R. Cannons J.L. Schwartzberg P.L. Cook M.C. Walters G.D. Vinuesa C.G. Follicular helper T cells are required for systemic autoimmunity.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Transfer of TFH cells from Sanroque mice was sufficient to yield spontaneous GC formation in wild-type mice, suggesting that the autoimmunity in Sanroque mice was due, at least in part, to deregulated TFH cell functions. However, lack of SAP did not eliminate all signs of autoimmunity in these lupus models. This could be because other cell types, like TH1 cells or TH17 cells, were also involved in disease pathogenesis. Critical questions remain to be addressed regarding the role and mechanism of action of SAP in antibody-mediated autoimmunity. First, whether SAP is critical for autoimmune conditions other than lupus requires evaluation. Second, the role of Fyn in the ability of SAP to mediate these processes needs to be clarified. Third, the relative contribution of SAP expression in TFH cells and, possibly, other T cell subsets should be examined. Fourth, the possibility that blockade of the SAP pathway could be used to delay or revert antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases in humans deserves to be assessed. Here we addressed these issues using a broad range of approaches and genetically modified mouse models. Our data showed that SAP was absolutely required for induction of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a model of antibody-mediated autoimmunity. This effect required expression of SAP in T cells, not in B cells. The ability of SAP to bind Fyn was largely dispensable for the capacity to induce CIA and anti-collagen antibodies when a high dose of collagen was used for immunization. This correlated with a lack of requirement of the SAP-Fyn interaction for full differentiation of TFH cells. However, when a lower dose of collagen was utilized, the capacity of SAP to bind Fyn was critical for full disease induction and anti-collagen antibody production. This finding suggested that additional effects in TFH cells or in other T cell types might be involved in disease pathogenesis. Because the only other T cell defect observed in collagen-immunized mice lacking the SAP-Fyn interaction was reduced NK-T cell numbers, it is possible that this cell type was implicated. Such an effect possibly related to the ability of SAP-associated Fyn to promote activation of Vav-1, which is needed for NK-T cell development (32.Chan G. Hanke T. Fischer K.D. Vav-1 regulates NK T cell development and NK cell cytotoxicity.Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2403-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Lastly, studies using an inducible SAP-deficient mouse showed that sustained SAP expression was needed for progression of CIA during the early phases of disease development. However, it was not required for maintenance of CIA when the disease was clinically established. C57BL/6 and DBA/1J mice were from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Montreal, Québec, Canada) and The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), respectively. SAP-deficient (Sh2d1a−/), SAP R78A (Sh2d1aR78A/), conditional SAP-deficient (Sh2d1afl/), Fyn-deficient (Fyn−/−), Cd4-Cre, Mb1-Cre, and Ubc-CreERT2 mice were described previously (13.Davidson D.

To study the effect of tissue-specific or inducible deletion of SAP on CIA, Sh2d1afl/+ females in the DBA/1J background were crossed with Cre-expressing males in the C57BL/6 mice. F1 mice were used for experimentation. This was made possible by the observation that the F1 progeny of a cross between WT C57BL/6 mice and WT DBA/1J mice was susceptible to CIA. To trigger CIA, mice were injected intradermally at the base of the tail with 100 μg of bovine type II collagen (CII, catalog no. 20021, Chondrex, Redmond, WA) supplemented with complete Freund adjuvant (catalog no. 7001, Chondrex) and 200 μg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a final volume of 0.1 ml. In some experiments, mice received a second immunization 15 weeks after the first immunization. Arthritis development was monitored clinically twice a week and scored using a scale of 0–4 (37.Rosloniec E.F. Cremer M. Kang A.H. Myers L.K. Brand D.D. Animal models of IgA nephropathy.Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2010; 15: 11-25Google Scholar): 0, no erythema and swelling; 1, erythema and mild swelling confined to the mid-foot (tarsals) or ankle joint; 2, erythema and mild swelling extending from the ankle to mid-foot; 3, erythema and moderate swelling extending from the ankle to the metatarsal joints; and 4, erythema and severe swelling encompassing the ankle, foot, and digits. The clinical score was the sum of the scores for the four extremities. Mice were also bled at the indicated times after immunization to measure collagen-specific antibodies in serum using ELISA (see below). Mice were injected with equal volumes of hapten (at 20 μg/ml) and alum (catalog no. 77161, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) in a final volume of 200 μl. The haptens were nitrophenyl (NP)(13)-ovalbumin (OVA) (catalog no. N-5051-100, Biosearch Technology) and phosphorylcholine (PC)(3)-OVA (catalog no. PC-5051-10, Biosearch Technology). Spleen cells were isolated 14 days after immunization with collagen and adjuvant. Cells were then reactivated for 4 h in vitro using phorbol myristate acetate (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (100 ng/ml). Cytokine production in CD4+ T cells was examined by intracellular staining as outlined below. Antigen-specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA as described previously (27.Veillette A. Zhang S. Shi X. Dong Z. Davidson D. Zhong M.C. SAP expression in T cells, not in B cells, is required for humoral immunity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To detect anti-collagen antibodies, ELISA-grade bovine CII (catalog no. 2012, Chondrex) or the CB11 fragment of bovine CII (catalog no. 9007, Chondrex) was used as coating antigen. To detect CII-specific IgE, 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added first to 300 μl of 1:100 diluted serum and incubated overnight to adsorb and eliminate IgG. The supernatants were then processed for ELISA. To detect hapten-specific Ig, NP(4)-BSA (catalog no. N-5050-10, Biosearch Technology) or PC(5)-BSA (catalog no. PC-1011-10, Biosearch Technology) was utilized as coating antigen. High-affinity collagen-specific antibodies were detected using the chaotropic agent NaSCN (1.0–2.0 M) as described (38.Simmons M.

https://openalex.org/W2031484121,"RAD54, an important homologous recombination protein, is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of ATPase-dependent DNA translocases. In vitro, RAD54 stimulates RAD51-mediated DNA strand exchange and promotes branch migration of Holliday junctions. It is thought that an ATPase-dependent DNA translocation is required for both of these RAD54 activities. Here we identified, by high-throughput screening, a specific RAD54 inhibitor, streptonigrin (SN), and used it to investigate the mechanisms of RAD54 activities. We found that SN specifically targets the RAD54 ATPase, but not DNA binding, through direct interaction with RAD54 and generation of reactive oxygen species. Consistent with the dependence of branch migration (BM) on the ATPase-dependent DNA translocation of RAD54, SN inhibited RAD54 BM. Surprisingly, the ability of RAD54 to stimulate RAD51 DNA strand exchange was not significantly affected by SN, indicating a relatively smaller role of RAD54 DNA translocation in this process. Thus, the use of SN enabled us to identify important differences in the effect of the RAD54 ATPase and DNA translocation on two major activities of RAD54, BM of Holliday junctions and stimulation of DNA pairing."
https://openalex.org/W2110322436,"A large number of laboratory and field based studies are being carried out on mole-rats, both in our research group and others. Several studies have highlighted the development of adverse behaviours in laboratory animals and have emphasised the importance of enrichment for captive animals. Hence we were interested in evaluating how laboratory housing would affect behavioural performance in mole-rats. We investigated exploratory behaviour, the ability to discriminate between novel and familiar environments and reference memory in the solitary Cape mole-rat (Georychus capensis). Our data showed that both wild and captive animals readily explore open spaces and tunnels. Wild animals were however more active than their captive counterparts. In the Y maze two trial discrimination task, wild animals failed to discriminate between novel and familiar environments, while laboratory housed mole-rats showed preferential spatial discrimination in terms of the length of time spent in the novel arm. The performance of the laboratory and wild animals were similar when tested for reference memory in the Y maze, both groups showed a significant improvement compared to the first day, from the 3rd day onwards. Wild animals made more mistakes whereas laboratory animals were slower in completing the task. The difference in performance between wild and laboratory animals in the Y-maze may be as a result of the lower activity of the laboratory animals. Laboratory maintained Cape mole-rats show classic behaviours resulting from a lack of stimulation such as reduced activity and increased aggression. However, they do display an improved novelty discrimination compared to the wild animals. Slower locomotion rate of the laboratory animals may increase the integration time of stimuli, hence result in a more thorough inspection of the surroundings. Unlike the captive animals, wild animals show flexibility in their responses to unpredictable events, which is an important requirement under natural living conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2111923505,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) functions as a neuroprotective factor through the PACAP type 1 receptor, PAC1. In a previous work, we demonstrated that nerve growth factor augmented PAC1 gene expression through the activation of Sp1 via the Ras/MAPK pathway. We also observed that PAC1 expression in Neuro2a cells was transiently suppressed during in vitro ischemic conditions, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Because endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is induced by ischemia, we attempted to clarify how ER stress affects the expression of PAC1. Tunicamycin, which induces ER stress, significantly suppressed PAC1 gene expression, and salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase signaling pathway of ER stress, blocked the suppression. In luciferase reporter assay, we found that two Sp1 sites were involved in suppression of PAC1 gene expression due to tunicamycin or OGD. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated that OGD-induced transglutaminase 2 (TG2) expression was suppressed by salubrinal or cystamine, a TG activity inhibitor. Further, the OGD-induced accumulation of cross-linked Sp1 in nuclei was suppressed by cystamine or salubrinal. Together with cystamine, R283, TG2-specific inhibitor, and siRNA specific for TG2 also ameliorated OGD-induced attenuation of PAC1 gene expression. These results suggest that Sp1 cross-linking might be crucial in negative regulation of PAC1 gene expression due to TG2 in OGD-induced ER stress."

Previous studies have suggested that an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) is required for increased SGK1 expression, but the subcellular source of Ca2+ regulating SGK1 transcription remains uncertain. Activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) with thapsigargin (TG) increased SGK1 mRNA and protein expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Intracellular Ca2+ imaging revealed that store-operated Ca2+ entry played a prominent role in SGK1 induction by TG. Neither ERS nor release of Ca2+ from the ER was sufficient to activate SGK1. Prolonged elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, however, triggered cell death with a much greater proportion of the cells undergoing necrosis rather than apoptosis. A relative increase in the percentage of cells undergoing necrosis was observed in cells expressing a short hairpin RNA targeted to the SGK1 gene. Necrotic cell death evoked by cytoplasmic Ca2+ overloading was associated with persistent hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and a modest increase in calpain activation, but did not involve detectable caspase 3 or caspase 7 activation. The effects of cytoplasmic Ca2+ overloading on mitochondrial membrane potential were significantly reduced in cells expressing SGK1 compared with SGK1-depleted cells.

The SGK1 gene, an immediate early response gene, was identified from serum- or glucocorticoid-stimulated transcripts in a rat mammary epithelial cell line (1.Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C.

In contrast to other rapidly degraded protein kinases, neither the catalytic activity of SGK1 nor activation site phosphorylation is required for ubiquitin modification and degradation. Instead, SGK1 degradation requires a lysine-less six-amino acid (amino acids 19–24) hydrophobic motif (GMVAIL) within the N-terminal domain that also serves to target SGK1 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria (9.Bogusz A.M.

Interaction with the stress-associated E3 ligase C terminus of Hsc (heat shock cognate protein) 70-interacting protein) (CHIP) is also required for ubiquitin modification and rapid proteasomal degradation of SGK1 (10.Belova L.

These studies indicate an important role of Ca2+ signaling pathways in SGK1 gene expression and kinase activity. However, the mechanisms underlying Ca2+-dependent activation of SGK1 remain unresolved.

Whether SGK1 provides prosurvival signaling in necrotic cell death is not known. Here, we used a combination of biochemical, pharmacological, and Ca2+ imaging approaches to define mechanisms underlying the Ca2+ signals that regulate SGK1 expression. In addition, we used shRNA to define cytoprotective signals requiring SGK1 expression in Ca2+-overloaded cells. Our results suggest that store-operated Ca2+ entry and subsequent calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity regulate SGK1 induction in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also discovered that necrotic cell death produced by a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ was attenuated by SGK1 prosurvival signals associated with maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential.

Nitrocellulose membranes were exposed to the following antibodies: anti-SGK1 (1:1000; Assay Designs), anti-P-SGK1 Ser-422 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-BiP (1:1000, BD Biosciences), with anti-fodrin (1:100) Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich) as a loading control, in TBST for 1 h (for anti-BiP and anti-β-actin) or overnight (for anti-SGK1 antibodies). The blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit HRP or anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized using an ECL chemiluminescent kit per manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). Densitometry was performed on the Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer, analyzed using Quantity One one-dimensional analysis software (Bio-Rad). Cells were washed in 1× PBS, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (1 μg) was then used for cDNA synthesis using a TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Reverse-transcribed RNA was combined with SYBR PCR Master Mix Green (Applied Biosystems) and primer pairs for SGK1 or the GAPDH gene.

https://openalex.org/W2022982900,"Many proteins exist and function as homodimers. Understanding the detailed mechanism driving the homodimerization is important and will impact future studies targeting the ""undruggable"" oncogenic protein dimers. In this study, we used 14-3-3σ as a model homodimeric protein and performed a systematic investigation of the potential roles of amino acid residues in the interface for homodimerization. Unlike other members of the conserved 14-3-3 protein family, 14-3-3σ prefers to form a homodimer with two subareas in the dimeric interface that has 180° symmetry. We found that both subareas of the dimeric interface are required to maintain full dimerization activity. Although the interfacial hydrophobic core residues Leu(12) and Tyr(84) play important roles in 14-3-3σ dimerization, the non-core residue Phe(25) appears to be more important in controlling 14-3-3σ dimerization activity. Interestingly, a similar non-core residue (Val(81)) is less important than Phe(25) in contributing to 14-3-3σ dimerization. Furthermore, dissociating dimeric 14-3-3σ into monomers by mutating the Leu(12), Phe(25), or Tyr(84) dimerization residue individually diminished the function of 14-3-3σ in resisting drug-induced apoptosis and in arresting cells at G2/M phase in response to DNA-damaging treatment. Thus, dimerization appears to be required for the function of 14-3-3σ."

https://openalex.org/W2094077269,"Background The myosin phosphatase is a highly conserved regulator of actomyosin contractility. Zebrafish has emerged as an ideal model system to study the in vivo role of myosin phosphatase in controlling cell contractility, cell movement and epithelial biology. Most work in zebrafish has focused on the regulatory subunit of the myosin phosphatase called Mypt1. In this work, we examined the critical role of Protein Phosphatase 1, PP1, the catalytic subunit of the myosin phosphatase. Methodology/Principal Findings We observed that in zebrafish two paralogous genes encoding PP1β, called ppp1cba and ppp1cbb, are both broadly expressed during early development. Furthermore, we found that both gene products interact with Mypt1 and assemble an active myosin phosphatase complex. In addition, expression of this complex results in dephosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain and large scale rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. Morpholino knock-down of ppp1cba and ppp1cbb results in severe defects in morphogenetic cell movements during gastrulation through loss of myosin phosphatase function. Conclusions/Significance Our work demonstrates that zebrafish have two genes encoding PP1β, both of which can interact with Mypt1 and assemble an active myosin phosphatase. In addition, both genes are required for convergence and extension during gastrulation and correct dosage of the protein products is required."
https://openalex.org/W2157329125,"Members of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases contribute to virtually every aspect of RNA metabolism, in organisms from all domains of life. Many of these helicases are constituents of multicomponent assemblies, and their interactions with partner proteins within the complexes underpin their activities and biological function. In Escherichia coli the DEAD-box helicase RhlB is a component of the multienzyme RNA degradosome assembly, and its interaction with the core ribonuclease RNase E boosts the ATP-dependent activity of the helicase. Earlier studies have identified the regulator of ribonuclease activity A (RraA) as a potential interaction partner of both RNase E and RhlB. We present structural and biochemical evidence showing how RraA can bind to, and modulate the activity of RhlB and another E. coli DEAD-box enzyme, SrmB. Crystallographic structures are presented of RraA in complex with a portion of the natively unstructured C-terminal tail of RhlB at 2.8-Å resolution, and in complex with the C-terminal RecA-like domain of SrmB at 2.9 Å. The models suggest two distinct mechanisms by which RraA might modulate the activity of these and potentially other helicases."
https://openalex.org/W2062095414,"Multiple types of natural collagens specifically assemble and co-exist in the extracellular matrix. Although noncollagenous trimerization domains facilitate the folding of triple-helical regions, it is intriguing to ask whether collagen sequences are also capable of controlling heterospecific association. In this study, we designed a model system mimicking simultaneous specific assembly of two collagen heterotrimers using a genetically inspired operation, circular permutation. Previously, surface charge-pair interactions were optimized on three collagen peptides to promote the formation of an abc-type heterotrimer. Circular permutation of these sequences retained networks of stabilizing interactions, preserving both triple-helical structure and heterospecificity of assembly. Combining original peptides A, B, and C and permuted peptides D, E, and F resulted primarily in formation of A:B:C and D:E:F, a heterospecificity of 2 of 56 possible stoichiometries. This degree of specificity in collagen molecular recognition is unprecedented in natural or synthetic collagens. Analysis of natural collagen sequences indicates low similarity between the neighboring exons. Combining the synthetic collagen model and bioinformatic analysis provides insight on how fibrillar collagens might have arisen from the duplication of smaller domains."

IFN-α mediates potent antiviral and antiproliferative activities of target cells through its interaction with IFN-α receptors.

TYK2 contributes to the IFN-induced signaling through its kinase activity, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT proteins (1.Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. The JAK-STAT pathway at twenty.Immunity. 2012; 36: 503-514Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STATs are subsequently translocated to the nucleus, where they affect gene expression. TYK2 also stabilizes basal IFNAR1 protein expression and ligand binding ability by kinase-independent mechanisms, especially in human cells (24.Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. The amino-terminal region of Tyk2 sustains the level of interferon α receptor 1, a component of the interferon α/β receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, TYK2 is important for the IFN response as the fundamental component of the IFN receptor complex. Based on the finding that a type 2 hyper-IgE syndrome patient was susceptible to intracellular bacterial infection and had a defect in the signal transduction of IFN-α and IL-12, human TYK2 deficiency has been identified as a molecular cause of type 2 hyper-IgE syndrome (26.Minegishi Y. Saito M. Morio T. Watanabe K. Agematsu K. Tsuchiya S. Takada H. Hara T. Kawamura N. Ariga T. Kaneko H. Kondo N. Tsuge I. Yachie A. Sakiyama Y. Iwata T. Bessho F. Ohishi T. Joh K. Imai K. Kogawa K.

Human tyrosine kinase 2 deficiency reveals its requisite roles in multiple cytokine signals involved in innate and acquired immunity.Immunity. 2006; 25: 745-755Google Scholar). In this study, we identified that the CSN component JAB1/CSN5 is a new TYK2 binding partner. We show that JAB1 positively regulates the basal protein stability of IFN receptor and the IFN response by antagonizing the neddylation pathway. This study shows the significance of JAB1 function in the optimal IFN responses in human cells. To generate a bait construct with human TYK2, PCR was used to amplify the cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 868–1187 (primer sequences are available upon request). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and inserted into pGBKT7. The bait plasmid, pGBKT7/TYK2, was stably expressed in yeast strain AH109. Y187 cells pretransformed with the human placenta Matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech) were used for mating. All yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (27.Muromoto R.

JAB1 encoding amino acids 30–334, whose gene product associated with TYK2 (amino acids 868–1187) in yeast, was subcloned into pCS2-MT vector. The full-length human JAB1 cDNA was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The full-length JAB1, JAB1 D151N, and JAB1 N mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the FLAG-tagged mammalian expression plasmid pSF1 (29.Yamakami M. Yoshimori T.

A human cervix carcinoma cell line (HeLa), a human embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line (293T), a human hepatoma cell line (Hep3B), and human keratinocytes (HaCaT) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS. A human T cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat) and a human pre-B cell leukemia (NALM-6) were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS. Human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells were purchased from Kurabo (Osaka, Japan) and maintained in HuMedia-SG2 (Kurabo), supplemented with 5% FCS, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 2 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor-B, and 5 μg/ml insulin. 293T cells were transfected using a standard calcium precipitation protocol. MG132 was purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor was purchased from LifeSensors (Malvern, PA). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays were performed as described previously (27.Muromoto R. Sugiyama K. Takachi A. Imoto S. Sato N. Yamamoto T. Oritani K. Shimoda K. Matsuda T. Physical and functional interactions between Daxx and DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein, DMAP1.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2985-2993Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates from the indicated cell lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were then immunoblotted with the different primary antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The following primary antibodies were obtained commercially: anti-JAB1, anti-STAT1, anti-STAT3, anti-CUL1, anti-NRF2, and anti-IFNAR1 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-TYK2, anti-phospho-STAT1, and anti-phospho-STAT3 antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); anti-CSN2 and anti-CSN4 antibodies from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY); anti-Myc (9E10), anti-FLAG (M2), and anti-actin antibodies from Sigma-Aldrich; anti-TYK2 antibody from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA); anti-IFNGR1 antibody from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); and anti-IFNAR2 antibody from Thermo Scientific/Pierce. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare. To analyze subcellular localizations of JAB1 and TYK2 proteins, plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged JAB1 and Myc-tagged TYK2 were transiently transfected into HeLa cells by jetPEI (PolyPlus-transfection, Strasbourg, France). Immunofluorescence staining procedures were performed as described previously (30.Muromoto R. Ishida M. Sugiyama K. Sekine Y. Oritani K. Shimoda K. Matsuda T. Sumoylation of Daxx regulates IFN-induced growth suppression of B lymphocytes and the hormone receptor-mediated transactivation.J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1160-1170Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-FLAG and mouse anti-Myc antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). For endogenous protein detection, a rabbit anti-JAB1 antibody (FL-334; Santa Cruz) and a monoclonal anti-TYK2 antibody (clone 51; BD Transduction Laboratories) were used. The secondary antibodies used were rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). DNA was visualized by staining with DAPI (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Fluorescent images were acquired using the fluorescent microscope BZ-8000 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The siRNAs used in this study were as follows: COPS5 (JAB1), 5′-GCUCAGAGUAUCGAUGAAA-3′; TYK2, 5′-GGAGAAACCTCCAATCTCA-3′; COPS2 (CSN2), 5′-GAGGGAAGGTGAATTTGA-3′; COPS4 (CSN4), 5′-GGCAGAGGCTTACATAAAT-3′; and NEDD8, 5′-AGGUGGAGCGAAUCAAGGA-3′. HeLa cells were plated on 24-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well and incubated with an siRNA (10 pmol) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) mixture at 37 °C for 4 h, followed by the addition of fresh medium containing 10% FCS. HeLa cells were further transfected with or without ISRE-LUC or STAT3-LUC using jetPEI. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were harvested and assayed for their luciferase activities using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). HeLa cells were stimulated with human IFN-α (provided by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) as indicated. After cell harvesting, total RNA samples were extracted using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Quantitative real time PCR analysis of mRNA transcripts was carried out using a combination of a KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR master mix (KAPA Biosystems, Woburn, MA) with an Mx3005P real time PCR system (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). The primers used for qPCR were: IRF1, 5′-AGCTCAGCTGTGCGAGTGTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TAGCTGCTGTGGTCATCAGG-3′ (antisense); PML, 5′-TTCTGGTGCTTTGAGTGCGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCACTGTGGCTGCTGTCAAG-3′ (antisense); CXCL11, 5′-AGAGGACGCTGTCTTTGCAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TAAGCCTTGCTTGCTTCGAT-3′ (antisense); IFNAR1, 5′-TAAGCCTTGCTTGCTTCGAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTGGAGGACCAATCTGAGC-3′ (antisense); COPS5 (JAB1), 5′-TCTGCTGAAGATGGTGATGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCAACCTGTTTTGCATTTT-3′ (antisense); ACTB, 5′-TGTTACCAACTGGGACGACA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGGTGTTGAAGGTCTCAAA-3′ (antisense); and APOBEC3G, 5′-TCCACCCACATTCACTTTCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCCAAAAGGGAATCACGTC-3′ (antisense). The HIV-1-based lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (31.Miyoshi H. Blömer U. Takahashi M. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Development of a self-inactivating lentivirus vector.J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8150-8157Google Scholar) was generated according to previously described procedures (32.Shibuya K. Shirakawa J. Kameyama T. Honda S. Tahara-Hanaoka S. Miyamoto A. Onodera M. Sumida T. Nakauchi H. Miyoshi H. Shibuya A. CD226 (DNAM-1) is involved in lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 costimulatory signal for naive T cell differentiation and proliferation.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1829-1839Google Scholar) with some modification. In brief, 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with appropriate amounts of the self-inactivating lentiviral vector pCSII-CMV-MCS-IRES-hrGFP, the packaging construct (pMDLg/pRRE), the Rev-expressing construct (pRSV-Rev), and the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein-expressing construct (pMD.G). The viral supernatants were collected 72 h after transfection and concentrated 300-fold by ultracentrifugation at 23,200 rpm (P50S2 swing rotor; Hitachi) for 2 h. For infection, HeLa cells were plated on 48-well plates and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS and concentrated lentivirus supernatants at a volume of 5 μl/well for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. GFP expression was analyzed using flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson). Logarithmically growing HeLa cells were incubated with either IFN-α, NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor or both for 24 h. Collected cells were fixed in 90% ethanol and stored overnight at −20 °C. Fixed cells were centrifuged to remove ethanol, and the pellets were resuspended in propidium iodide and RNase A in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. The DNA content of nuclei was analyzed by FACS. Statistical evaluation of differences between populations was determined using Student's t test. The results shown are the means and standard error of the mean. To identify new TYK2-interacting proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the kinase domain of TYK2 fused to the Gal DNA-binding domain (Y2H bait) as bait (Fig. 1A). A human placenta cDNA library was screened. Among a number of positive clones, one clone encoded the N terminus-truncated portion of previously described JAB1 (Y2H clone) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether this clone encoded a protein able to interact with TYK2 in mammalian cells, the cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCS2-MT. The resulting expression vector produced a protein that interacted with TYK2 in 293T cells (Fig. 1C). Next, we examined the association between TYK2 and JAB1 using the full-length or mutated cDNA. The JAB1 MPN domain contains the JAMM motif that functions as a catalytic site for the CSN isopeptidase activity (23.Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Role of predicted metalloprotease motif of Jab1/Csn5 in cleavage of Nedd8 from Cul1.Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Google Scholar). The JAMM motif mutant, which harbors a single amino acid substitution from the conserved Asp to Asn at codon 151 (JAB1 D151N), is impaired in its activity. We also generated a JAB1ΔC mutant (JAB1 N), which lacks the nuclear export signal-containing C-terminal potion of JAB1 (Fig. 1B). Using these JAB1 mutants, we tested whether the JAB1-TYK2 interaction requires an intact JAMM motif. FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant JAB1 with or without TYK2 was introduced into 293T cells, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 1D, the D151N mutant of JAB1 interacted with TYK2 similarly to the wild type JAB1. In addition, JAB1 N interacted rather strongly with TYK2, suggesting that the MPN domain-containing N-terminal portion of JAB1 is sufficient for interacting with TYK2, although the intact JAMM motif is not necessary. TYK2 domains responsible for the interaction with JAB1 were then determined. We checked whether the kinase domain of TYK2 is required for the interaction with JAB1 using a truncated form of TYK2 that lacks the kinase domain (TYK2ΔKD) (Fig. 1A). The full-length TYK2 or TYK2ΔKD construct was transiently transfected into 293T cells together with the full-length JAB1 construct. Cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (for TYK2) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody (for JAB1). Unexpectedly, TYK2ΔKD interacted with JAB1 similarly to the full-length TYK2 (Fig. 1E). Thus, we divided the TYK2 cDNA into four regions (Fig. 1A), and each corresponding TYK2 construct was tested for JAB1 binding ability by immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 1F, JAB1 strongly interacted with only TYK2 (600–1086), whereas it interacted very weakly with TYK2 (833–1187), which contains the kinase domain. These data suggest that JAB1 mainly interacts with the region around the pseudokinase domain of TYK2 in mammalian cells. Binding between endogenous JAB1 and TYK2 as well as involvement of TYK2 activation in this interaction were also investigated. A human cervix carcinoma cell line, HeLa, which expressed both JAB1 and TYK2, was employed, and the cell line was stimulated with IFN-α to activate TYK2. As can be seen in Fig. 1G, JAB1 was present in the TYK2 immunoprecipitates, and their binding was not altered after IFN-α stimulation. Therefore, a part of JAB1 and TYK2 spontaneously associates in HeLa cells. Finally, subcellular localization of JAB1 and TYK2 was examined. We expressed Myc-tagged TYK2 along with FLAG-tagged JAB1 in HeLa cells, and analysis with immunofluorescence microscopy showed that TYK2 was mostly co-localized with JAB1 throughout the cells (Fig. 1H). Furthermore, endogenous TYK2 co-localized with endogenous JAB1 in cells in the absence or presence of IFN-α stimulation (Fig. 1I). Their co-localization was observed in both nuclei and cytoplasm, because recent studies and a review stated that either TYK2 or JAB1 localizes in both nuclei and cytoplasm (20.Wei N. Deng X.W. The COP9 signalosome.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 261-286Google Scholar, 33.Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Vasserot A. Romero P. Uzé G. Pellegrini S.

Pascalli M.P. Johnson H.M. Type I IFN receptor controls activated TYK2 in the nucleus. Implications for EAE therapy.J. Neuroimmunol. 2013; 254: 101-109Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that JAB1 has the ability to interact with TYK2 in mammalian cells. Data for the binding between TYK2 and JAB1 gave rise to a possibility that the interaction might be required for IFN-α-induced signals. We examined whether the selective knockdown of endogenous JAB1 (encoded by COPS5) modulates downstream events of IFN-α stimulation. IFN-α induces the activation of TYK2, which in turn phosphorylates STAT proteins. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of TYK2 was clearly detected in control HeLa cells within 5 min after IFN-α stimulation, JAB1 knockdown HeLa cells failed to show TYK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). In addition, IFN-α-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was greatly decreased by knockdown of JAB1 (Fig. 2B). When TYK2 expression was reduced by specific TYK2 siRNA, IFN-α-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 almost disappeared (Fig. 2C). Of importance, TYK2 knockdown had a larger influence on STAT1 phosphorylation than JAB1 knockdown, and combined knockdown of both JAB1 and TYK2 did not additively reduce STAT1 phosphorylation compared with knockdown of TYK2 alone. Therefore, JAB1 regulates STAT1 activation in a TYK2 expression-dependent manner. The activity of STAT1-containing ISGF3 complex can be measured as luciferase reporter activity using ISRE-Luc, and the activity of STAT3 can be measured as reporter activity using STAT3-Luc (35.Muromoto R. Okabe K. Fujimuro M. Sugiyama K. Yokosawa H. Seya T. Matsuda T. Physical and functional interactions between STAT3 and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded LANA.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 93-98Google Scholar). We tested the effects of JAB1 knockdown on IFN-α-induced activation of STAT1 and STAT3 in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2D, knockdown of JAB1 significantly reduced luciferase activities by ISRE-Luc and STAT3-Luc after IFN-α stimulation (Fig. 2D). We then examined the effects of JAB1 knockdown on IFN-α-induced gene expression. Reverse transcription quantitative real time PCR experiments revealed that IFN-α-induced IRF1, CXCL11, and PML mRNA expressions were all significantly reduced in JAB1 knockdown HeLa cells (Fig. 2E). We also analyzed the mRNA levels of JAB1 itself and IFNAR1, which are important components of the IFN-α receptor complex. We found that IFN-α treatment up-regulated the JAB1 mRNA level by ∼1.8-fold and that JAB1 knockdown did not significantly affect the mRNA level of IFNAR1. These results suggest that JAB1 is involved in the optimal IFN-α-induced signaling and gene expression. Although JAB1 has been shown to stabilize and destabilize the protein levels of its binding partners (19.Wei N. Serino G. Deng X.W. The COP9 signalosome. More than a protease.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 592-600Google Scholar), we did not observe any changes in the protein levels of TYK2 or downstream STAT proteins by transfection of JAB1 siRNA (Fig. 2, A and B). It has been reported that TYK2 constitutively interacts with and stabilizes IFNAR1 (25.Kumar K.G. Varghese B. Banerjee A. Baker D.P. Constantinescu S.N. Pellegrini S. Fuchs S.Y. Basal ubiquitin-independent internalization of interferon alpha receptor is prevented by Tyk2-mediated masking of a linear endocytic motif.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18566-18572Google Scholar); therefore, we examined whether knockdown of endogenous JAB1 affects the IFNAR1 protein level. Knockdown of JAB1 induced a significant decrease in the IFNAR1 protein level (Fig. 3A). TYK2 siRNA also induced a decrease in the protein level of IFNAR1; however, the decrease was more severe. We next assessed the cell surface expression level of IFNAR1 by surface biotinylation followed by pulldown using streptavidin-agarose. As shown in Fig. 3B, JAB1 knockdown resulted in the reduction of not only"

We used a targeted and systematic approach to delineate the role of highly conserved transmembrane helix 2 on the expression and function of hASBT. Cysteine mutation significantly depressed transport activity for >60% of mutants without affecting cell surface localization of the transporter. All mutants were inaccessible toward chemical modification by membrane-impermeant MTSET reagent, strongly suggesting that transmembrane 2 (TM2) plays an indirect role in bile acid substrate translocation. Both bile acid uptake and sodium dependence of TM2 mutants revealed a distinct α-helical periodicity. Kinetic studies with conservative and non-conservative mutants of sodium sensitive residues further underscored the importance of Gln(75), Phe(76), Met(79), Gly(83), Leu(86), Phe(90), and Asp(91) in hASBT function. Computational analysis indicated that Asp(91) may coordinate with sodium during the transport cycle. Combined, our data propose that a consortium of sodium-sensitive residues along with previously reported residues (Thr(134), Leu(138), and Thr(149)) from TM3 may form the sodium binding and translocation pathway. Notably, residues Gln(75), Met(79), Thr(82), and Leu(86) from TM2 are highly conserved in TM3 of a putative remote bacterial homologue (ASBTNM), suggesting a universal mechanism for the SLC10A transporter family."

These autoantibodies possess sufficient bioactivity to alter the postural vascular response, thus contributing to the pathophysiology of postural hypotension, especially the “idiopathic” type, i.e. without known causes. In this study, we describe a novel human monoclonal anti-β2AR autoantibody derived from a patient with idiopathic postural hypotension. Our report directly links this human IgG autoantibody with a functional in vitro impact on β2AR mediation of smooth muscle vasodilatation. Our evidence supports the hypothesis that autoantibodies play a role in the control of hypotension. The patient at 48 years of age developed repetitive episodes of a supraventricular tachycardia and subsequently hypotensive episodes upon standing. During the posture test, he demonstrated a significant drop in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 52/22 mm Hg and a significant increase in heart rate of 18 beats/min. This was partially diminished when he was placed on the non-selective βAR blocker carvedilol. The patient was not on any immunomodulatory medications at the time. His serum demonstrated significantly elevated titer and functional activity of anti-β2AR autoantibodies (22Li H. Kem D.C. Reim S. Khan M. Vanderlinde-Wood M. Zillner C. Collier D. Liles C. Hill M.A. Cunningham M.W. Aston C.E. Yu X. Agonistic autoantibodies as vasodilators in orthostatic hypotension: a new mechanism.Hypertension. 2012; 59: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Peripheral lymphocytes were separated from whole blood by Histopaque-1077 Hybri-Max (Sigma) and stimulated for 1 week with pokeweed mitogen (2 μg/ml) in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% human AB serum. Cells were washed three times with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium without serum and fused with HMMA2.11TG/0 cells (human/mouse myeloma cell line) using polyethylene glycol 1000 as described previously (23Adderson E.E. Shikhman A.R. Ward K.E. Cunningham M.W. Molecular analysis of polyreactive monoclonal antibodies from rheumatic carditis: human anti-N-acetylglucosamine/anti-myosin antibody V region genes.J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2020-2031PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridomas were selected by culture in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium and screened by ELISA as described previously (22Li H. Kem D.C. Reim S. Khan M. Vanderlinde-Wood M. Zillner C. Collier D. Liles C. Hill M.A. Cunningham M.W. Aston C.E. Yu X. Agonistic autoantibodies as vasodilators in orthostatic hypotension: a new mechanism.Hypertension. 2012; 59: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using a synthetic peptide (HWYRATHQEAINCYANETCCDFFTNQ) derived from ECL2 of human β2AR (primary accession number P07550). Cloning of hybridomas was achieved by limiting dilution and was performed three times. Established clones were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Positive clones were checked for isotype with isotype-specific secondary antibodies (Sigma). This study was approved by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Institutional Review Board, and the subject provided written informed consent. Epitope mapping for monoclonal antibody C5F2 was performed with Multipin solid-phase peptides (Mimotopes), which comprised a set of 19 octapeptides overlapping by 7 amino acids spanning ECL2 of β2AR. C5F2 IgG (1:50) was added to the wells of a 96-well plate along with the solid-phase peptides and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The peptides were washed with PBS/Tween 20 and incubated with anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The reactivity of C5F2 to the solid-phase peptides was measured by adding tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution in the developing plate. The absorbance values were read at 405 nm. SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare). The N-terminally biotinylated β2AR ECL2 peptide (1 mg/ml) was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 5 min. Increasing concentrations of C5F2 (3–100 nm) were injected into the flow cells at 5 μl/min for 12 min in running buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P20), followed by a 5-min dissociation phase with running buffer at the same flow rate. The sensor chip was regenerated with 50 mm NaOH and 1 m NaCl. Affinity, association, and dissociation rate constants were calculated using the BIAevaluation software. H9c2 cardiomyocytes were washed, harvested, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Cell lysates with an equal amount of protein (50 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml C5F2 or rabbit anti-β2AR polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoreaction was quantified by densitometric scanning. C5F2 specificity was tested by preincubation with the β2AR ECL2 peptide (20 μg/ml) for 5 h at room temperature. CHO cells expressing human β2AR were cultured on glass coverslips in a 6-well plate for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For tissue staining, rat aorta frozen sections were fixed with acetone. After blocking, cells or tissue sections were incubated with C5F2, C5F2 pre-absorbed with the β2AR ECL2 peptide, pooled normal human IgG (Sigma), or rabbit anti-β2AR polyclonal antibody (5–10 μg/ml) for 1 h, followed by incubation with FITC-labeled anti-human or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope. C5F2-mediated β2AR activation of cAMP production in CHO cells was measured using the cAMP Hunter eXpress GPCR assay kit (DiscoveRx) as described (22Li H. Kem D.C. Reim S. Khan M. Vanderlinde-Wood M. Zillner C. Collier D. Liles C. Hill M.A. Cunningham M.W. Aston C.E. Yu X. Agonistic autoantibodies as vasodilators in orthostatic hypotension: a new mechanism.Hypertension. 2012; 59: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30,000 cAMP Hunter eXpress β2AR-expressing CHO cells were dispensed into each well of a 96-well culture plate and incubated overnight. The medium was then removed, and assay buffer containing the cAMP antibody and C5F2 (0.05–500 nm) were sequentially added and incubated for 30 min. C5F2 in the presence of the β2AR-selective blocker ICI-118551, C5F2 pre-absorbed with an excess of the β2AR ECL2 peptide, pooled normal human IgG, and the β-agonist isoproterenol (used as a positive control) were all tested in triplicate. Following sample treatment, cAMP detection reagent and solution were added, and the chemiluminescent signal was read on a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner BioSystems). The cAMP values are expressed as relative luminescence units. The vasodilatory effect of C5F2 via activation of β2AR on resistance vessels was examined using an isolated rat cremaster arteriole assay as described (22Li H. Kem D.C. Reim S. Khan M. Vanderlinde-Wood M. Zillner C. Collier D. Liles C. Hill M.A. Cunningham M.W. Aston C.E. Yu X.

Potocnik S.J. Price S. Transient increases in diameter and [Ca2+]i are not obligatory for myogenic constriction.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 278: H345-H352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cremaster arterioles were removed from anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats (180–250 g). An ∼2-mm segment of the main intramuscular arteriole was microdissected, transferred to a temperature-regulated superfusion chamber (Living Systems Instrumentation), and cannulated at each end with glass micropipettes. Measurements of internal vessel diameter were made using a video edge detector (Model VED-205, Crescent Electronics). After equilibration and development of steady-state myogenic tone, the arterioles were perfused with C5F2 (0.5–500 nm). The β2AR blocker ICI-118551 was then added to the perfusate containing the maximally effective dose of C5F2, and the effect on vessel diameter was recorded. The effects of C5F2 preincubated with the β2AR ECL2 peptide and pooled normal human IgG were also tested. Data are reported as a percentage of the maximal dilatory response to normalize the values. The maximal dilatory response was defined as the increase in diameter from basal tone to the maximal Ca2+-free passive dilation at 70 mm Hg measured at the end of each preparation. This procedure was approved by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. RNA was extracted from C5F2 hybridoma cells using an RNAqueous RNA isolation kit (Ambion). One microliter of purified RNA was used for RT-PCR. In brief, RNA was converted to cDNA using a One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Individual reactions were performed for the human heavy chain (five primers), κ-light chain (four primers), and λ-light chain (eight primers) as detailed for single-cell reactions (25Smith K. Garman L. Wrammert J. Zheng N.Y. Capra J.D. Ahmed R. Wilson P.C. Rapid generation of fully human monoclonal antibodies specific to a vaccinating antigen.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was then run on an agarose gel to confirm the presence of a properly sized band and the lack of contamination in the buffer controls. Positive samples were sequenced to obtain V and J gene usage. Finally, another round of PCR was performed using V and J gene-specific primers containing restriction sites for cloning into a transient expression vector (25Smith K. Garman L. Wrammert J. Zheng N.Y. Capra J.D. Ahmed R. Wilson P.C. Rapid generation of fully human monoclonal antibodies specific to a vaccinating antigen.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Nucleotide alignments with germ-line genes were performed using the sequence analysis tools IgBLAST (26Ye J. Ma N. Madden T.L. Ostell J.M. IgBLAST: an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence analysis tool.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: W34-W40Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) and IMGT/V-QUEST (27Giudicelli V.

Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Comparison between individual groups was performed by Student's unpaired t test and one-way analysis of variance, followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Over 5000 wells were screened for the presence of anti-β2AR antibodies by a β2AR ECL2 peptide-based ELISA. Eleven positive supernatants were selected for retesting to eliminate unstable clones. Two of the 11 supernatants were stably positive, and one single clone (C5F2) was obtained after repeated limiting dilution. C5F2 was found to be of the IgG3 isotype, and secretion has been stable for >6 months. To determine the epitope of C5F2, a set of 19 overlapping peptides covering ECL2 of β2AR were synthesized and tested for their reactivity with C5F2. The only sequence recognized by C5F2 was HWYRATHQE, which is located at the N terminus of β2AR ECL2 (Fig. 1) and which is similar to the reported epitope of an agonistic mouse monoclonal antibody against human β2AR (29Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Mijares A. Granier C. Argibay J. Hoebeke J. An agonist-like monoclonal antibody against the human β2-adrenoceptor.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 348: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The binding affinity and kinetics of C5F2 were analyzed by SPR using a BIAcore instrument. The sensorgrams showing interaction of increasing concentrations of C5F2 with the immobilized biotinylated β2AR ECL2 peptide (Fig. 2) demonstrated a high binding affinity (KD = 13 nm) of C5F2 for the peptide. SPR measurements yielded an equilibrium constant of 7.8 × 107 m−1, with an association rate constant of 1.1 × 105 m−1 s−1 and a dissociation rate constant of 1.4 × 10−3 s−1.FIGURE 2SPR sensorgrams of C5F2 binding to the peptide. The sensorgrams were generated by injecting increasing concentrations (3.1, 6.2, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 nm) of C5F2 onto the immobilized β2AR ECL2 peptide. The SPR response was measured in resonance units (RU) versus time. Binding constants were calculated using the BIAevaluation software.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western blotting with C5F2 or rabbit anti-β2AR polyclonal antibody as a positive control revealed an immunoreactive band of ∼65 kDa in the H9c2 cell lysate (Fig. 3), which corresponded to glycosylated β2AR (30Benovic J.L. Shorr R.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. The mammalian β2-adrenergic receptor: purification and characterization.Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4510-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To check the specificity of reactivity, C5F2 was neutralized with the β2AR ECL2 peptide before immunodetection (Fig. 3). The intensity of the immunoreactive band was greatly decreased by peptide pre-absorption. To analyze binding of C5F2 to β2AR, immunofluorescence was also performed with rat aorta and CHO cells expressing human β2AR. C5F2 reacted with the receptor in both aorta tissue and CHO cells (Fig. 4). In rat aorta, C5F2 binding was observed in the endothelium, as well as in the medial smooth muscle cell. The staining pattern was similar to that obtained with rabbit anti-β2AR polyclonal antibody. Preincubation of C5F2 with the β2AR ECL2 peptide diminished the fluorescence signal in both aorta tissue and CHO cells, confirming the specific binding of C5F2 to β2AR. Pooled normal human IgG did not show any significant reactivity.FIGURE 4Immunofluorescence staining of β2AR with C5F2 in CHO cells and rat aorta. CHO cells expressing human β2AR and rat aorta tissue were stained with C5F2, rabbit anti-β2AR polyclonal antibody (positive control), or pooled normal human IgG (negative control) and FITC (green)-labeled secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Both C5F2 and the positive control antibody demonstrated strong reactivity, whereas normal control IgG did not show any significant binding. C5F2 binding was abolished by pre-absorption with the β2AR ECL2 peptide. All images were obtained at ×40 magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) C5F2 was tested for its ability to stimulate cAMP production in CHO cells expressing human β2AR (Fig. 5). A typical dose response for the β-agonist control isoproterenol is shown in Fig. 5A. A similar dose effect for C5F2 was observed (Fig. 5B). C5F2 reached its maximal effect at ∼50 nm with an EC50 of 3 nm. C5F2 (50 nm) induced a significant increase in cAMP production compared with pooled normal human IgG (8352 ± 574 versus 1175 ± 324 relative luminescence units; p < 0.01), which was effectively blocked by the β2AR-specific blocker ICI-118551 (1 μm) (Fig. 5C) and by preincubation with the β2AR ECL2 peptide (Fig. 5D) (2568 ± 581 and 2095 ± 199 relative luminescence units, respectively; p < 0.01). No significant increase in cAMP production was found with normal human IgG compared with the buffer base line. The vasodilator response to C5F2 was examined using a rat cremaster arteriolar assay (Fig. 6). There was a significant dose effect on vasodilatation for C5F2 (data not shown). Representative tracings of C5F2-induced vasodilatation and its blockade by the β2AR-specific blocker ICI-118551 and by preincubation with the β2AR ECL2 peptide are shown in Fig. 6 (A and B). C5F2 (100 nm)-induced vasodilatation was significantly decreased by ICI-118551 (1 μm) (Fig. 6C) and by preincubation with the β2AR ECL2 peptide (Fig. 6D) (from 67.8 ± 5.8% to 9.3 ± 5.1% and 4.4 ± 2.1%, respectively; p < 0.01), indicating that antibody activation of vascular β2AR may contribute to systemic vasodilatation. Pooled normal human IgG failed to produce any significant vasodilatation. The VH(D)J/VLJ genes of the C5F2 heavy chain and λ-light chain were cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences of the C5F2 VH and VL genes, shown in Fig. 7 (A and B), were submitted to the IgBLAST and International Immunogenetics Information System (IMGT) databases for comparison with germ-line sequences. The germ-line genes most homologous to the C5F2 VH and VL genes are VH4-39 and VL2-8, respectively. The C5F2 VH gene has 97.3% homology to the germ-line VH4-39 gene, and the C5F2 VL gene has 93.8% homology to the germ-line VL2-8 gene. Isolating monoclonal autoantibodies from humans by cell fusion presents a considerable challenge due to the small number of antigen-specific activated B cells in circulation. The difficulty in obtaining functionally active monoclonal antibodies, e.g. thyroid-stimulating monoclonal antibodies, is well recognized (31McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Thyroid stimulating monoclonal antibodies: overcoming the road blocks and the way forward.Clin. Endocrinol. 2004; 61: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To date, only one human thyroid-stimulating monoclonal autoantibody has been isolated and characterized (32Sanders J. Evans M. Premawardhana L.D. Depraetere H. Jeffreys J. Richards T. Furmaniak J. Rees Smith B. Human monoclonal thyroid stimulating autoantibody.Lancet. 2003; 362: 126-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here, we have reported the successful cloning of an agonist-like anti-β2AR monoclonal antibody (C5F2) from a patient with idiopathic postural hypotension and recurrent cardiac tachyarrhythmias. This antibody recognized an epitope in the N-terminal sequence of β2AR ECL2, which may be critical for formation of the active receptor conformation. ECL2 appears to be a major autoimmune target, as most reported GPCR autoantibodies target this domain. Previous studies on the β1AR structure revealed that the only predicted amino acid stretch containing both B and T cell epitopes accessible to antibodies was located in ECL2 of β1AR (33Hoebeke J. Structural basis of autoimmunity against G protein coupled membrane receptors.Int. J. Cardiol. 1996; 54: 103-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This may well be the case for other GPCRs. A single-chain variable fragment derived from a mouse β2AR-activating monoclonal antibody (GenBankTM accession number AJ574851) has been reported previously (34Peter J.C. Eftekhari P. Billiald P. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. scFv single chain antibody variable fragment as inverse agonist of the β2-adrenergic receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36740-36747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although it is very difficult to compare the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of fully human and fully mouse antibodies, the mouse antibody heavy chain CDR3 is GGRGLDV, and our human heavy chain CDR3 is GRRGADCSGGNCPPVDF, indicating that perhaps the GXRGXD motif is important for binding to the receptor. The mechanism by which autoantibodies activate β2AR is not yet clear. GPCR autoantibodies act as allosteric modulators of their target receptors, which may promote or stabilize receptor conformational changes required for receptor activation. It is known that GPCRs can exist as functional dimers (35Milligan G. G protein-coupled receptor dimerization: function and ligand pharmacology.Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar); therefore, the bivalent autoantibodies may exert their agonistic effect by inducing and stabilizing an active dimeric receptor conformation. This concept was supported by the loss of activity from cleavage of an agonistic mouse anti-β2AR monoclonal antibody into monovalent Fab fragments and restoration after cross-linking of the fragments with anti-mouse IgG (36Mijares A. Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. From agonist to antagonist: Fab fragments of an agonist-like monoclonal anti-β2-adrenoceptor antibody behave as antagonists.Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody C5F2 had a high binding affinity for the β2AR ECL2 peptide as measured by SPR. In addition, it reacted with differing tissues known to possess β2AR, including native β2AR, in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, CHO cells expressing human β2AR, rat aorta, and rat cremaster arterioles. Specific binding of C5F2 to β2AR was confirmed by inhibition with the β2AR ECL2 peptide. Functionally, C5F2 was able to stimulate cAMP production in β2AR-expressing CHO cells, which could be specifically blocked by a β2AR-selective antagonist and by the β2AR ECL2 peptide. More importantly, C5F2 perfusion of resistance arterioles produced a potent vasodilatation, which could also be inhibited by the β2AR blocker and β2AR ECL2 peptide, indicating that antibody activation of vascular β2AR may contribute to systemic vasodilatation. The functional activity of C5F2 was consistent with that of serum IgG polyclonal autoantibodies from the patient and of serum anti-β2AR autoantibodies harbored in a subgroup of postural hypotension patients (21Yu X.

Ferro A. β-Adrenergic receptors and nitric oxide generation in the cardiovascular system.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1070-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The finding that β2AR-activating autoantibodies intrinsically possess the capability to induce significant systemic arteriolar vasodilatation suggests that these autoantibodies may contribute to postural hypotension by altering the normal autonomic response to upright posture. Both β1AR and β2AR have a significant impact on cardiac function. The identification of a unique role for each in atrial and ventricular function has occupied a large number of investigators over the years since these receptors were identified. We recently reported that activation of β2AR following autoimmunization of a rabbit model with the β2AR ECL2 peptide was associated with development of sustained atrial tachyarrhythmias that were distinctly different from those observed in the β1AR-autoimmunized rabbit (16Li H. Scherlag B.J. Kem D.C. Zillner C. Male S. Thirunavukkarasu S. Shen X. Pitha J.V. Cunningham M.W. Lazzara R. Yu X. Atrial tachycardia provoked in the presence of activating autoantibodies to β2-adrenergic receptor in the rabbit.Heart Rhythm. 2013; 10: 436-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is possible that activating autoantibodies to β2AR and β1AR may induce cardiac tachyarrhythmias when other risk factors such as aberrant atrioventricular conduction and ischemia coexist. The availability of this human monoclonal autoantibody has important implications for future studies on the precise mechanisms of antibody-mediated receptor activation. Detailed analysis of antibody-receptor interactions with powerful techniques such as x-ray crystallography can also be expected to lead to new interventions based on specific inhibition of pathological autoantibodies. The effects of C5F2 on receptor binding of orthosteric ligands remain to be studied. The orthosteric ligand-binding sites on β2AR are located within a pocket formed by the first and second extracellular loops (39Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R.M. Karnik S.S. The high affinity state of the β2-adrenergic receptor requires unique interaction between conserved and non-conserved extracellular loop cysteines.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether allosteric autoantibodies can alter orthosteric ligand binding will be determined by future competitive binding studies. Moreover, the allosteric modulation of orthosteric agonist-mediated signaling by autoantibodies and its implications in cardiovascular pathophysiology need to be explored. A single-chain variable fragment constructed from a mouse β2AR-activating monoclonal antibody has been shown to serve as an allosteric inverse agonist (34Peter J.C. Eftekhari P. Billiald P. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. scFv single chain antibody variable fragment as inverse agonist of the β2-adrenergic receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36740-36747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Further studies on C5F2 using a similar approach will provide important data supporting development of novel and highly specific allosteric GPCR modulators. In conclusion, an agonist-like human anti-β2AR monoclonal autoantibody was isolated and characterized. The specificity and functional properties of this antibody support the concept that circulating autoantibodies serve as vasodilators and may cause or exacerbate orthostasis by altering the compensatory postural vascular response. The known impact of β2AR agonists on cardiac function and the association of tachyarrhythmias in the patient harboring this autoantibody support a broad role of these autoantibodies in cardiovascular pathophysiology. The availability of this first human monoclonal autoantibody to β2AR provides opportunities to identify previously unrecognized causes and new pharmacological management of postural hypotension and other cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2028585273,"In the nervous system of mice, small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels function to regulate neuronal excitability through the generation of a component of the medium afterhyperpolarization that follows action potentials. In humans, irregular action potential firing frequency underlies diseases such as ataxia, epilepsy, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Due to the complexity of studying protein function in the mammalian nervous system, we sought to characterize an SK channel homologue, KCNL-2, in C. elegans, a genetically tractable system in which the lineage of individual neurons was mapped from their early developmental stages. Sequence analysis of the KCNL-2 protein reveals that the six transmembrane domains, the potassium-selective pore and the calmodulin binding domain are highly conserved with the mammalian homologues. We used widefield and confocal fluorescent imaging to show that a fusion construct of KCNL-2 with GFP in transgenic lines is expressed in the nervous system of C. elegans. We also show that a KCNL-2 null strain, kcnl-2(tm1885), demonstrates a mild egg-laying defective phenotype, a phenotype that is rescued in a KCNL-2-dependent manner. Conversely, we show that transgenic lines that overexpress KCNL-2 demonstrate a hyperactive egg-laying phenotype. In this study, we show that the vulva of transgenic hermaphrodites is highly innervated by neuronal processes and by the VC4 and VC5 neurons that express GFP-tagged KCNL-2. We propose that KCNL-2 functions in the nervous system of C. elegans to regulate the rate of egg-laying."
https://openalex.org/W2055031215,"Copy number variants (CNV) can be called from SNP-arrays; however, few studies have attempted to combine both CNV and SNP calls to test for association with complex diseases. Even when SNPs are located within CNVs, two separate association analyses are necessary, to compare the distribution of bi-allelic genotypes in cases and controls (referred to as SNP-only strategy) and the number of copies of a region (referred to as CNV-only strategy). However, when disease susceptibility is actually associated with allele specific copy-number states, the two strategies may not yield comparable results, raising a series of questions about the optimal analytical approach. We performed simulations of the performance of association testing under different scenarios that varied genotype frequencies and inheritance models. We show that the SNP-only strategy lacks power under most scenarios when the SNP is located within a CNV; frequently it is excluded from analysis as it does not pass quality control metrics either because of an increased rate of missing calls or a departure from fitness for Hardy-Weinberg proportion. The CNV-only strategy also lacks power because the association testing depends on the allele which copy number varies. The combined strategy performs well in most of the scenarios. Hence, we advocate the use of this combined strategy when testing for association with SNPs located within CNVs."
https://openalex.org/W2083505766,"Objective This study aimed to evaluate the preliminary clinical and radiographic outcomes of acute displaced femoral neck fracture treated by closed reduction and internal fixation (CRIF) with free iliac bone block grafting with comparison to a routine protocol of CRIF without bone grafting. Methods From December 2008 to February 2010, 220 adult patients with acute displaced femoral neck fractures were enrolled in this study. In study group, there were 124 patients (57 males, 67 females) with a mean age of 44.8 years (range, 20-64 years). There were 70 transcervical fractures and 54 subcapital fractures. The patients were treated by CRIF and free iliac bone block grafting. The control group consisted of 96 adult patients (46 males, 50 females) with a mean age of 46.3 years (range, 23-64 years). There were 61 transcervical fractures and 35 subcapital fractures. The patients in control group were treated by CRIF without bone grafting. Results In study group, 112 patients were followed up for an average of 27.4 months (range, 24-34 months). All fractures healed within 5 months. However, 10 patients presented AVN of the femoral heads. The mean Harris score was 88.6 (range, 41-100). In control group, 68 patients were followed up for an average of 31.2 months (range, 24-42 months). The rates of AVN of the femoral head and fracture nonunion in control group were 26.5% (18/68) and 16.2% (11/68), respectively, significantly higher than those in study group (both P<0.05). The mean Harris score in control group was 83.8 (41–100), significantly lower than that in study group (P<0.05). Conclusion Acute displaced femoral neck fractures can be treated by CRIF and free iliac bone block grafting in a minimally invasive manner. This technique can guarantee uneventful fracture healing and significantly reduce the rate of femoral head osteonecrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2132421414,"Many natural sounds fluctuate over time. The detectability of sounds in a sequence can be reduced by prior stimulation in a process known as forward masking. Forward masking is thought to reflect neural adaptation or neural persistence in the auditory nervous system, but it has been unclear where in the auditory pathway this processing occurs. To address this issue, the present study used a ""Huggins pitch"" stimulus, the perceptual effects of which depend on central auditory processing. Huggins pitch is an illusory tonal sensation produced when the same noise is presented to the two ears except for a narrow frequency band that is different (decorrelated) between the ears. The pitch sensation depends on the combination of the inputs to the two ears, a process that first occurs at the level of the superior olivary complex in the brainstem. Here it is shown that a Huggins pitch stimulus produces more forward masking in the frequency region of the decorrelation than a noise stimulus identical to the Huggins-pitch stimulus except with perfect correlation between the ears. This stimulus has a peripheral neural representation that is identical to that of the Huggins-pitch stimulus. The results show that processing in, or central to, the superior olivary complex can contribute to forward masking in human listeners."
