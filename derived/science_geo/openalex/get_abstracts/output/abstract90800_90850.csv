https://openalex.org/W2079729858,"The primary sequence of the major heat shock gene of D. melanogaster, that for the 70,000 protein, has been determined. One of the reading frames is devoid of stop codons for over 2000 bp. The region between the first ATG and the first stop codon encodes a protein of molecular weight 70,270. The 5' end of the messenger RNA was localized in the DNA sequence by two independent methods. The 5' flanking sequences of three distinct 70K genes were also determined. Extensive homology in the primary sequences extends about 500 bp upstream from the ATG, which is the presumptive initiation of protein synthesis. Each 70K gene has the putative promoter sequence TATAAATA about 325 bp upstream from this ATG. A heptanucleotide sequence identified as the capping site for other messengers is found 24-30 bp downstream from the ends of the A-T-rich sequence. A 12 bp sequence with dyad symmetry begins 23 bp upstream from the beginning of the above A-T-rich sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1554826669,"Rat liver microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase was prepared free of detectable amounts of FMN by a new procedure based on the exchange of this flavin into apoflavodoxin. The resulting FMN-free reductase binds NADP in the oxidized state with the same affinity (Kd = 5 microM) and stoichiometry (1:1 molar ratio) as does the native enzyme. Both the native and FMN-free reductase catalyze rapid reduction of ferricyanide, but the ability to reduce th 5,6-benzoflavone-inducible form of the liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 (P-450LM4) is lost upon removal of FMN. The FMN-free enzyme was reconstituted with artificial flavins which, in the free state, have oxidation-reduction potentials ranging from -152 to -290 mV, including 5-carba-5-deaza-FMN and several FMN analogs with a halogen or sulfur substituent on the dimethylbenzene portion of the ring system. Enzyme reconstituted with 5-carba-5-deaza-FMN has catalytic properties which are not significantly different from those of the FMN-free reductase, and is unable to reduce P-450LM4. On the other hand, the ability to reduce P-450LM4 and the other FMN-dependent activities of the native reductase are restored by substitution of several other analogs for FMN, but the kinetics of P-450LM4 reduction, studied under anaerobic conditions by stopped flow spectrophotometry, are significantly altered. The oxidation-reduction behavior of enzyme reconstituted with 7-nor-7-Br-FMN is substantially different from that of the native enzyme, and less thermodynamic stabilization of the semiquinone is observed with this flavin analog. In contrast, the oxidation-reduction properties of enzyme containing 8-nor-8-mercapto-FMN are similar to those of the native enzyme, but the spectral properties are significantly different. As shown in a stopped flow experiment, reduction of this FMN analog precedes reduction of P-450LM4 when a complex of the flavoprotein and P-450LM4 is allowed to react with NADPH. Our experiments support a sequence of electron transfer in this enzyme system as follows: NADPH leads to FAD leads to FMN leads to P-450. We propose that the enzyme cycles between a le- and a 3e-reduced state during turnover and that electrons are donated to acceptors via the reaction, FMNH2 leads to FMNH .."

The purpose was to investigate the role of calcium in mediating afterhyperpolarizations following bursts evoked by intracellular current pulses, arising spontaneously, or induced by the epileptogenic agent pencillin. In the first two cases the afterhyperpolarization was blocked and the associated conductance increase was reduced, suggesting that EGTA was blocking the calcium-activated potassium conductance during the hyperpolarization. In the third case the afterhyperpolarization and associated conductance increase persisted, implicating an alternative mechanism for the hyperpolarization. ?2Ns 04053"
https://openalex.org/W1992366933,"We have isolated recombinant DNA clones that contain the genomic sequences coding for the three most abundant proteins in Drosophila eggs, the yolk proteins (YP1, YP2 and YP3). The identity of these cloned genes was established by a two-step procedure. We used the genes to isolate complementary mRNA from total Drosophila RNA; we than showed the in vitro translation products of the isolated mRNAs to be the yolk proteins by comparing their protease digestion products to those of yolk proteins isolated from eggs. An examination of these isolated genes and of their DNA complements in the Drosophila genome showed that each of the three coordinately expressed yolk proteins is encoded by a different single-copy gene. Three genes were cloned; each has a different pattern of restriction endonuclease sites and each appears to be homologous to a different yolk protein mRNA. Southern transfer blots demonstrated that there is only one copy of each gene in the Drosophila genome. Our structural studies have shown that these three genes are not adjacent. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes demonstrated, in fact, that the YP3 gene is approximately 1000 kb from the closely spaced YP1 and YP2 genes. Thus, if the coordinate synthesis of the yolk proteins is due to transcriptional control, there must be coordinate control of initiation at two distant sites."
https://openalex.org/W1566324809,"A procedure has been developed for the isolation of human Factor VII to apparent homogeneity as judged by the analytical disc electrophoretic system of Davis (pH 8.9) and by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The isolated procedure involves adsorption of Factor VII onto barium citrate, ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The overall yield of Factor VII is 15 to 20% of starting plasma and the purified protein has a specific activity of 1800 to 2200 units/mg in a clotting assay. Factor VII protein obtained by this method has only 1.3 to 1.5 times more activity in a one-stage clotting assay than in a coupled amidolytic assay (Seligsohn, U., Osterud, B., and Rapaport, S. I. (1978) Blood 52, 978-988), which is taken to mean than it contains less than 5% of activated Factor VII. Human Factor VII is a single chain glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 50,000 +/- 2,000 as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It has alanine as an NH2-terminal amino acid residue and contains 8.8 gama-carboxyglutamic acid residues/mol of protein. Incubation of purified Factor VII with Factor Xa in the presence of Ca(II) and phospholipid results in a rapid up to 25-fold increase in its clotting activity. Factor VII activity in the coupled amidolytic assay remains unchanged throughout the incubation. Activation of Factor VII by Factor Xa is associated with cleavage of the Mr = 50,000 native protein to a protein consisting of two chains of Mr = about 26,000 and 22,000 as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Other properties of human Factor VII, including its amino acid composition and its reactions with an anti-Factor VII antibody, are described."
https://openalex.org/W1526369005,"Ca2+ transport mechanisms were investigated using membrane vesicles prepared from guinea pig brain synaptosomes by hypotonic lysis. Two major mechanisms of Ca2+ transport exist, Na+-Ca2+ exchange and ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake. A third although minor component of Ca2+ uptake occurs under hyperpolarizing conditions (determined by increased uptake of [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium+). Na+-Ca2+ exchange results in a rapid increase of [Ca2+]i (up to 100-fold above [Ca2+]O), has a Km for Ca2+ of 40 microM, is fully reversed by added external Na+, is inhibited by agents dissipating Na+ gradients (monensin or veratridine), and is uninfluenced by mitochondrial inhibitors. ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake has a higher affinity for CA2+ (Km = 12 microM), is dependent on Mg2+ or Mn2+, and is inhibited by beta, gamma-imidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate and VO43-, although only slightly (20%) inhibited by high concentrations of mitochondrial inhibitors. Both mechanisms are temperature-dependent, fully reversed by A23187, and higher in the presence of external K+. Ca2+ loaded in vesicles via ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake is rapidly effluxed upon addition of external Na+ (as for Na+-Ca2+ exchange). Therefore a single population of vesicles exists containing both Ca2+ transport mechanisms. The two mechanisms are independent since they accumulate Ca2+ additively, are selectively inhibited by monensin and VO43-, and show distinct specificity toward other divalent cations and La3+. Although independent, Na+ (100 mM) inhibits ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake (Km for ATP increased from 40 to 300 microM) in the absence of any net Na+ movement. Since Na+-Ca2+ exchange functions in the synaptosomal plasma membrane, the results suggest that both Ca2+ transport mechanisms originate from this membrane and function in the present experiments in inverted plasma membrane vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W2130012375,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) was used as a probe to study the mechanism by which protein ligands are internalized by mammalian cells. Both biochemical and electron microscopic methods were used to look at the internalization of PE by mouse LM cell fibroblasts. Our data suggest that PE enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, a process previously thought to be restricted to the entry of biologically significant molecules such as lysosomal enzymes and peptide hormones. Biochemical studies showed that methylamine (20 mM) and chloroquine (10 microM) protected LM cells from the action of PE. Full protection was observed if methylamine or chloroquine was added to the monolayers simultaneously with toxin or if they were added up to 10 min after toxin binding. Later addition of amine or chloroquine afforded partial protection to the monolayers. With immunoelectron microscopy we observed that in the cold toxin bound diffusely to the cell surface but was rapidly internalized when cells were warmed to 37 degrees C. In the presence of methylamine, chloroquine or ammonium chloride, internalization did not occur. We propose that PE enters mouse fibroblasts by receptor-mediated endocytosis and that chloroquine and methylamine, agents which are known to block this process, prevent expression of toxicity."

https://openalex.org/W95482459,"Washed human platelets suspended in buffers containing either 1.8 mM Ca2+ and 0.49 mM Mg2+ or 1 mM EDTA were treated with human alpha-thrombin to induce secretion. Glycoprotein G, a major glycoprotein in alpha-granules, was quantitatively secreted from platelets activated in the EDTA-containing buffer but remained with the platelet in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. Addition of Ca2+ to the platelets that were activated in the presence of EDTA caused glycoprotein G to bind to platelets. To determine if glycoprotein G is expressed on the membrane surface of the activated platelet, platelets were rapidly labeled by a method employing lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination. Although glycoprotein G was barely detected on the surface of unstimulated platelets, labveling 1 min after thrombin treatment showed that glycoprotein G rapidly became one of the prominent surface proteins. These findings show that an alpha-granule protein, glycoprotein G, is one of the major glycoproteins on the membrane surface of thrombin-activated platelets and that its binding is dependent on divalent cations."

https://openalex.org/W2064428517,"The rates of synthesis and turnover of histone mRNA in Drosophila embryos were determined by hybridization of in vivo and in vitro labeled embryonic RNA to Drosophila histone DNA of the recombinant plasmid cDm500. There is a large store of maternal histone mRNA, equivalent to at least 7 X 10(7) copies of each of the five classes of histone mRNA per embryo. Embryonic synthesis of histone mRNA begins at 90 min after oviposition, making the histone genes among the first to be transcribed by embryonic nuclei. Embryonic histone mRNA accumulates rapidly during the blastoderm and gastrula stages. The peak in the rate of histone mRNA synthesis per embryo coincides with the peak in the rate of DNA synthesis per embryo, which occurs at 6 hr after oviposition. After 6 hr, as the rate of DNA synthesis per embryo decreases, the rate of histone mRNA synthesis and the total mass of histone mRNA per embryo both drop sharply. The rate of histone mRNA synthesis per gene falls more than 60 fold in the first 13 hr after oviposition, from 1.3 -2.5 copies per gene-min at 2 hr to 0.02-0.03 copies per gene-min at 13 hr. From measurements of the mass of histone mRNA per embryo and of the rate of accumulation of newly synthesized histone mRNA at a number of stages of early embryogenesis we determined that the cytoplasmic half-life of histone mRNA decreases approximately 7 fold during early Drosophila development, from 2.3 hr at blastoderm to 20 min by the end of gastrulation. Thus the level of expression of histone genes in Drosophila development is controlled not only by the size of the maternal mRNA pool and changes in the rate of histone mRNA synthesis, but also by changes in the rate of histone mRNA turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2137776746,"Analysis of amino acid and nucleotide sequences of kappa immunoglobulin chains and their genes has led to the hypothesis that the exact site of V-J joining in these genes varies and that this variation is partially responsible for generating amino acid diversity at the recombination site. To assess this hypothesis we have cloned and determined the sequence of one of the two V-J recombinant genes carried by the plasmacytoma MOPC173 and the V region germline precursor of this gene. We find that this V region has been joined to a J segment at a crossover point that indeed differs from the one previously described. This recombination has occurred in such a way as to produce an out of phase, missense reading frame and, hence, a cryptic light chain gene. This result directly supports the cross-over-point variation hypothesis but also indicates that the flexibility of this reaction is accompanied by a cost to the organism in terms of the generation of missense genes."

https://openalex.org/W2036067282,"We previously described an alpha-amanitin-resistant mutant of D. melanogaster (AmaC4 or simply C4) with an altered, amanitin-resistant RNA polymerase II. We have now more fully characterized this mutant genetically and biochemically. We genetically mapped C4 to position 35.66 on the X chromosome and cytogenetically localized it to the polytene chromosome band interval 10C2-10D4. We then demonstrated that C4 is allelic to a previously known lethal-mutable locus I(1)L5 in this chromosomal region. Several known lethal alleles of L5 in fact affected the properties of RNA polymerase II in vitro. Following EMS mutagenesis of the C4-bearing chromosome we recovered new lethal L5 alleles, some of which were shown biochemically to have an altered amanitin-resistance polymerase II component. Furthermore, we induced mutants of C4 that had lost amanitin-resistance and showed that these mutants were also lethal alleles of L5. All the lethal alleles of L5 failed to completely complement each other genetically, and when analyzed biochemically their polymerase II displayed altered enzymatic properties. We conclude that C4 is an allele of the L5 locus and that this locus is most probably a structural gene for a subunit of RNA polymerase II. Some of the mutants at this locus display developmental abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W1665700251,"Aphidicolin, a known inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, is a potent inhibitor of nuclear DNA synthesis in HeLa cells but has no effect on the replication of mitochondrial DNA. Parallel experiments with mitochondria incubated in vitro also show no inhibition of DNA synthesis by aphidicolin; however, DNA synthesis in these isolated mitochondria is completely blocked by dideoxycytidine triphosphate, which inhibits DNA polymerase gamma but not the alpha polymerase. The replication of mitochondrial DNA therefore requires only one DNA polymerase of the gamma type."
https://openalex.org/W2041352505,"The 5S gene cluster of Drosophia melanogaster is a tandem array of a repeat unit made up of a 135 bp gene plus a 238 bp spacer. The length of the 5S repeat (373 bp) equals the average length of a Drosophila dinucleosome. Digestion of Drosophila nuclei with micrococcal nuclease generates discrete 5S RNA gene subfragments when the purified DNA is further cleaved with a single-cut restriction enzyme. We have mapped four micrococcal nuclease-sensitive sites within the 5S repeat: A1, centered at bp −110 (+1 being the G:C bp at the start of the gene); A1′, at bp −80; A2, at bp +80, within the intragenic control region; and B, at −190 bp. These findings suggest that nucleosomes can be positioned on the 5S gene repeat in one of two possible phases, A or B. In the A phase a potential regulatory sequence near the center of the gene is exposed in one of the two linkers of the repeat. In the B phase, in contrast, one of the linkers includes the 5′ end of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1484906518,"The beta subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme has been purified 10,000-fold to homogeneity from Escherichia coli HMS-83. The native and denatured molecular weights of beta are 72,000 and 37,000, as determined by equilibrium sedimentation. Thus, beta appears to exist as a dimer when in a state free of other holoenzyme components. This conclusion is supported by the native molecular weight calculated from the sedimentation coefficient (5.0 S) and the Stokes radius (32.5 A) and subunit molecular weights determined from denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An antibody directed specifically against the beta subunit has been prepared and found to block the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme-catalyzed reaction, but not reactions which require only the core DNA polymerase III. Furthermore, this antibody blocks the initiation, but not the elongation reaction catalyzed by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Thus, beta may only be required for formation of the initiation complex between polymerase components and a primed template. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that the beta subunit forms a complex with other holoenzyme components in solution, in the absence of DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1989172581,"To probe mechanisms operating at the CH gene locus during normal B lymphocyte differentiation, we have used cloned probes for the constant region genes Cmu, C gamma 1 and C alpha to analyze the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes of three kinds of cell populations in successive stages of B cell development. These are IGM-bearing B lymphocytes from the normal spleen of unprimed mice, hybridomas prepared by fusing spleen cells from antigen-primed mice with the SP2/O permanent cell line and selected to secrete one of five different isotypes (IgM, IgG3, IgG1, IgG2 and IgA) and a set of plasmacytoma lines. The IgM-bearing B cells carry Cmu genes with rearrangements between VH and JH genes on both chromosomes even though only one chromosome is expressed; clearly, allelic exclusion cannot be explained by the lack of CH gene rearrangement on the nonexpressed chromosome. The normal splenic DNA component of antibody-secreting hybridomas displays rearrangements between JH and Cmu genes as well as among CH genes other than Cmu, with concomitant deletion of CH genes 5' to those expressed. These CH rearrangements and deletions are likely to accompany the isotype switching process and may occur on both expressed and nonexpressed chromosomes. We used hybridomas (spleen-derived), which secrete primarily IgM, and plasmacytomas (gut-derived), which secrete primarily IgA, to represent plasma cells in early and late stages of differentiation, respectively. A direct comparison of hybridomas and plasmacytomas making the same products (IgG3 or IgG1) indicates that hybridomas display a low frequency (2/12) of nonexpressed C alpha gene rearrangements in contrast to the high frequency (7/10) displayed by plasma-cytomas. We propose that CH gene switching rearrangements and deletions may occur successively along the CH gene locus, involving any of the undeleted genes at each step. These can occur on both expressed and nonexpressed chromosomes during the normal clonal outgrowth of a B cell line in vivo, and would result in the accumulation of both productive and nonproductive rearrangements of the presumed last CH gene, C alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2001368101,"When the germ line of Drosophila males is destabilized by a syndrome known as hybrid dysgenesis, X-chromosome rearrangements are found in up to 10 percent of the gametes produced. Some of these aberrations are simple inversions, but many are complex multibreak rearrangements. Furthermore, most of the breakpoints fall into a few highly localized positions on the chromosome. These positions are mostly at points of intercalary heterochromatin and may vary from one strain to the next. the results suggest that they may represent points of insertion of mobile DNA sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1590271961,"Streptococcus faecalis, like other bacteria, expels Na+ and accumulates K+. Sodium movements in several bacterial species have been attributed to secondary antiport of Na+ for H+, energized by the proton-motive force. We find a more complex pattern: a circulation of Na+ across the plasma membrane. One limb is the diffusion of Na+, into the cells or out, by a low affinity pathway in response to gradients of concentration and of electrical potential; Na+ movements are enhanced in metabolizing cells. The other limb is the vectorial extrusion of Na+ by a transport system that requires (either ATP itself or a related metabolite), even when Na+ is moving downhill. Cells glycolyzing at alkaline pH in buffer containing excess K+ can expel Na+ against a concentration gradient of 100-fold, even in the presence of reagents that block or short circuit the proton circulation (pH gradient and membrane potential both zero). Evidently, under these conditions can serve as the energy donor for a primary sodium pump. However, at acid pH, or in presence of low levels of K+, sodium extrusion requires both and the proton-motive force. A mutant is described that retains the leak pathway but lacks the ATP-linked transport system."

The molecular weight of the enzyme following purification is identical with that in the soluble extract from beef hearts, and similar to that of the rabbit skeletal muscle isoenzyme (i.e. approximately 1.3 X 10(6)) based on co-migration in sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The molecular weights of the subunits determined by SDS gel electrophoresis are: alpha', 134,000; beta, 125,000; gamma, 48,000. The subunit stoichiometry is determined to be alpha 1 beta 1.01 gamma 1.35 with a faint band co-migrating with purified bovine brain calmodulin. The enzyme displays little, if any, activity below pH 6.0, but activity increases markedly in the pH range of 6.8 to 8.2.

Ca2+ is required for enzyme activity; ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (0.5 mM) completely inhibited the activity of th nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzyme, and activity was restored by the addition of Ca2+ (Ka for Ca2+, 1.94 and 1.35 microM for the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzyme, respectively."

In media containing high concentrations of Ca2+, about 2 mM, both isozymes were bound to the affinity column. When the column was eluted with a buffer containing 0.2 mM Ca2+, the red muscle isozyme was eluted, whereas white muscle isozyme was eluted from the column by an ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. The purified white muscle isozyme can be distinguished from the red muscle isozyme by its ability to inhibit calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. The two isozymes are also regulated differently by calmodulin. Both isozymes contain tightly bound calmodulin as a subunit (Cohen, P., Burchell, A., Foulkes, J. G., Cohen, P. T. W., Vanaman, T.

The product was identified both by bioassay and by mass spectrometry. Labeled cells produced prostacyclin only when exposed to the initiator thrombin: treatment with therapeutic concentrations of aspirin (0.2 millimolar) for 30 minutes completely destroyed the cells' ability to synthesize prostacyclin. Prostacyclin synthesis from exogenous arachidonic acid recovered fully within 1 to 2 hours by a cycloheximide-sensitive process. Thrombin responsivness, which was permanently impaired in confluent nondividing cultures, recovered substantially and within 24 hours only when cells were stimulated to divide by subculturing. These results indicate that resting vascular cells can rapidly synthesize new cyclooxygenase, but that aspirin destroys additional components of the prostacyclin system which can only be replaced during cell division."

The secreted polymer was isolated and characterized as a linear cell wall glycan strand substituted predominantly by uncross-linked pentapeptide side chains. Polymer formation and secretion are most likely the result of continued synthesis and elongation of nascent glycan strands in the absence of subsequent processing by peptidoglycan transpeptidase or D-alanine carboxypeptidase enzymes. The nonglycan-bound pentapeptide, L-Ala-D-iso-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid-D-Ala-D-Ala, was probably formed by an N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase active on the peptide side chains of The uncross-linked polymer. The uncross-linked peptidoglycan polymer was shown to be a good substrate for penicillin-sensitive D-alanine carboxypeptidases purified from membranes of B. subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, and Escherichia coli. D-alanine release was not, however, coupled to the cross-linking of peptide side chains, suggesting that these enzymes do not function as peptidoglycan transpeptidases in vivo. No transpeptidase or D-alanine carboxypeptidase activity was detected in mixtures of high molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins from B. subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, or Staphylococcus aureus. Possible reasons for the inability to demonstrate these activities are discussed.

The overall length of the side chain which permitted maximal metabolism corresponded closely to that in cholesterol and other natural sterols. Maximal metabolism was observed only with sterols bearing side chains which had 5 or 6 carbon atoms (other than C-21) attached to C-20. The extent of metabolism fell gradually to zero as the length of the chain was increased or decreased. No metabolism at all occurred with side chains of no carbon atoms (pregn-5-en-3 beta-ol) or as many as 12 carbon atoms (20(R)-n-dodecylpregn-5-en-3 beta-ol) on C-20 other than C-21. Dehydrogenation in the side chain was more sensitive to chain length than was dehydrogenation in Ring B. The data presented here reinforce the view that the enzymes involved in sterol metabolism are actually directed toward binding with sterols. Furthermore, since the sterols become components of the ciliary membrane of this protozoan, the observed structural requirements for metabolism presumably reflect the structural requirements for membrane architecture; and the evidence presented then suggests that the natural length of the sterol side chain is governed by the sterol's membranous function."

https://openalex.org/W1608878464,"Antibodies to homogeneous calf thymus DNA polymerase-beta and calf thymus DNA polymerase-alpha preparations were raised in rabbits. The antiserum against calf thymus DNA polymerase-beta cross-reacts with all vertebrate DNA polymerase-beta preparations tested, but does not cross-react with trypanosome DNA polymerase-beta, DNA polymerase-gamma, terminal transferase, yeast DNA polymerases, and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The antibodies against calf thymus DNA polymerase-alpha cross-react with DNA polymerase-alpha from mouse, human, and chicken, but do not cross-react with DNA polymerase-alpha from sea urchin embryos and Drosophila embryos, DNA polymerase-beta, DNA polymerase-gamma, terminal transferase, yeast DNA polymerases, and E. coli DNA polymerase I."

https://openalex.org/W1514305650,"The regulation of myocardial protein turnover was studied using newborn rat heart cells in monolayer cultures. Protein accumulation in this model system was regulated by the presence of serum in the culture medium. The influences of serum on the rates of protein synthesis and degradation were investigated. Serum deprivation or arginine deprivation did not modify protein synthesis. In contrast serum strongly inhibited the rates of [3H]leucine release from prelabeled long-lived myocardial proteins. The inhibiting serum factor was found heat-stable, displayed slight species specificity, was of plasmatic origin, and its activity was decreased in the plasma of hypophysectomized rats. Platelet growth factor, which promotes DNA synthesis in heart cell cultures, did not inhibit protein degradation. The influence of known regulators of myocardial protein balance was investigated. Leucine had no influence on protein synthesis and degradation. Supraphysiological concentrations of insulin and growth hormone inhibited protein degradation but only in the absence of serum. It is suggested that these compounds may not be the natural regulators of myocardial protein balance."

https://openalex.org/W1521778406,"Iodine is readily incorporated from ICl into galactosyltransferase with total loss of enzymatic activity. The extent of modification was determined by separation of 125I-labeled proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tyrosines are the only amino acids modified by iodination of galactosyltransferase, a maximum of five, and alpha-lactalbumin, a maximum of three. The major product of the iodination was 3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine and the remainder was 3-monoiodo-L-tyrosine. Inactivation of galactosyltransferase was dependent on the degree of modification. Substrates of galactosyltransferase are capable of partial protection against enzymatic inactivation. alpha-Lactalbumin, by itself, was also capable of protecting galactosyltransferase against inactivation. This represents evidence for a specific interaction of galactosyltransferase with alpha-lactalbumin in the absence of carbohydrate. The protection of galactosyltransferase by alpha-lactalbumin was enhanced by the presence of the substrates, Mn2+, N-acetylglucosamine, and UDP. Under conditions of either substrate protection or in the absence of substrates, the inactivation reaction of galactosyltransferase by ICl is apparent third order, apparent first order in galactosyltransferase, and apparent second order in galactosyltransferase, and apparent second order in ICl. The apparent order, with respect to ICl, suggests the involvement of 2 mol of ICl either both at one site or one each at two different sites."
https://openalex.org/W1604918001,"A double selection method for isolating active enzyme molecules, using substrate analog affinity chromatography and elution with transition state analogs, is described. To demonstrate the principle, a mixture containing native chymotrypsin and [3H]deoxychymotrypsin, in which the active site serine had been converted to [3H]alanine, was applied to a column containing immobilized D-tryptophan methyl ester. Both forms of chymotrypsin were retained. Catalytically active enzyme was selectively desorbed with the peptide aldehyde chymostatin, leaving catalytically inactive deoxychymotrypsin bound to the substrate analog affinity column. This affinity technique may afford a simple and general method for separating enzymes and other catalysts according to their molecular turnover numbers."
