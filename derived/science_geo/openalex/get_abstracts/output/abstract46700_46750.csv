https://openalex.org/W1915536483,"Vesicles are released during the in vitro culture of sheep reticulocytes which can be harvested by centrifugation at 100,000 X g for 90 min. These vesicles contain a number of activities, characteristic of the reticulocyte plasma membrane, which are known to diminish or disappear upon reticulocyte maturation. The activities include acetylcholinesterase, cytochalasin B binding (glucose transporter) nucleoside binding (i.e. nucleoside transporter), Na+-independent amino acid transport, and the transferrin receptor. Enzymes of cytosolic origin are not detectable or are present at low activity in the vesicles. Cultures of whole blood, mature red cells, or white cells do not yield comparable levels of these activities, supporting the conclusion that the activities arise from the reticulocytes. In addition, the lipid composition of the vesicles shows the high sphingomyelin content characteristic of sheep red cell plasma membranes, but not white cell or platelet membranes, also consistent with the conclusion that the vesicles are of reticulocyte origin. It is suggested that vesicle externalization may be a mechanism for shedding of specific membrane functions which are known to diminish during maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1554427720,"Using nondegradative isolation procedures we purified and characterized five major noncollagenous proteins from developing human bone. Small bone proteoglycan I, Mr approximately 350,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gels has a different amino-terminal sequence of NH2-Asp-Glu-Glu-()-Gly-Ala-Asp-Thr and is not cross-reactive with the small bone proteoglycan II, Mr approximately 200,000 on SDS-gradient polyacrylamide gels. Bone proteoglycan II is 95% N terminally blocked and the small amount that can be sequenced has an amino-terminal sequence (NH2-Asp-Glu-Ala-()-Gly-Ile. . .) that is apparently similar but not identical to a small proteoglycan isolated by Brennan, M.J., Oldberg, A., Pierschbacher, M.D., and Ruoslahti, E. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13742-13750 from human fetal placenta membrane. Two bone sialoproteins, each of which migrates at a Mr approximately 80,000 on SDS gels, have also been isolated. Bone sialoprotein I has an amino-terminal sequence of NH2-Ile-Pro-Val-Lys-Gln-Ala. . . which is different from that of bone sialoprotein II with an amino-terminal sequence of NH2-Phe-Ser-Met-Lys-Asn-Leu. . . The two bone sialoproteins do not cross-react on Western blot analysis. Human bone osteonectin contains a large number of cysteines, more than 90% of which appear to be in disulfide bonds. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of human bone osteonectin was nearly identical to bovine bone osteonectin and had many similarities to a protein found in mouse parietal endoderm (Mason, I.J., Taylor, A., Williams, J.G., Sage, H., and Hogan, B.L.M. (1986) EMBO J. 5, 1831-1837."
https://openalex.org/W1579992296,"Extracellular ATP induces cation fluxes in thioglycolate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages and the J774 macrophage cell line apparently due to ligation of a plasma membrane receptor for ATP4-. We report that ATP permeabilizes the plasma membrane of J774 cells to 6-carboxyfluorescein (376 Da), lucifer yellow (457 Da), and fura-2 (831 Da) but not to trypan blue (961 Da), Evans blue (961 Da), or larger dye conjugates. We employed fluorescence microscopy and quantitative fluorimetry to study entry of lucifer yellow into the cytoplasm of J774 cells. Permeabilization to lucifer yellow appears to be mediated by the same ATP4- receptor that induces cation fluxes because it was inhibited by divalent cations and low pH, was mediated by the nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate, and because a variant J774 cell line resistant to ATP-induced Rb+ efflux did not take up lucifer yellow when exposed to ATP. ATP permeabilization was reversed within 5 min by removal of ATP or by addition of divalent cations. ATP also caused a transient increase in lucifer yellow uptake by pinocytosis. These data suggest that ATP4- ligates a receptor on macrophages which induces the formation of a channel admitting molecules less than or equal to 831 daltons into the cytoplasmic matrix and that removal of ATP4- from the medium causes rapid channel closure."
https://openalex.org/W1566648241,"This study evaluated the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiratory control as a function of tissue oxidative capacity. The mitochondrial content of rat skeletal muscle was increased by exercise training or decreased by hypothyroidism. Muscles of the lower hindlimb were stimulated to tetanically contract in situ for 3 min at one of four frequencies to elicit a 30-fold range of oxygen consumption rates. Freeze-clamped sections of fast-twitch red gastrocnemius muscle were extracted and analyzed for metabolite levels. The sensitivity of respiratory control was examined for three models of cytosolic respiratory control (ADPf, ATP/ADPf, and ATP/(ADPf X Pi]; for each proposed model, sensitivity went up as mitochondrial content increased. Thus, a smaller change in cytosolic modulator (e.g., ADPf) is required as oxidative capacity increases. Increases in the sensitivity of cytosolic respiratory control resulted in lower flux through the near-equilibrium energy exchange reactions of creatine kinase and myokinase such that calculated free concentrations of ADP and AMP were less. Other energetically important reactions/pathways were also affected. Accumulation of lactate and the deamination of AMP to IMP were lower in tissues with higher mitochondrial content. In summary, changes in oxidative capacity directly influence the sensitivity of cytosolic respiratory control and this, in turn, has important consequences for maintenance of cellular energy balance."

https://openalex.org/W1633034930,"The effects of various inhibitors of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I were examined in mitochondria from rat liver and skeletal muscle. Three types of inhibitors were used: malonyl-CoA (reversible), tetradecylglycidyl-CoA and three of its analogues (irreversible), and 2-bromopalmitoyl-CoA (essentially irreversible when added with carnitine). Competitive binding studies between labeled and unlabeled ligands together with electrophoretic analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized membranes revealed that in mitochondria from both tissues all of the inhibitors interacted with a single protein. While the binding capacity for inhibitors was similar in liver and muscle (6-8 pmol/mg of mitochondrial protein) the proteins involved were of different monomeric size (Mr 94,000 and 86,000, respectively). Treatment of mitochondria with the detergent, octyl glucoside, yielded a soluble form of carnitine palmitoyltransferase and residual membranes that were devoid of enzyme activity. The solubilized enzyme displayed the same activity regardless of whether carnitine palmitoyltransferase I of the original mitochondria had first been exposed to an irreversible inhibitor or destroyed by chymotrypsin. It eluted as a single activity peak through four purification steps. The final product from both liver and muscle migrated as single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis with Mr of approximately 80,000. The data are consistent with the following model. The inhibitor binding protein is carnitine palmitoyltransferase I itself (as opposed to a regulatory subunit). The hepatic monomer is larger than the muscle enzyme. Each inhibitor interacts via its thioester group at the palmitoyl-CoA binding site of the enzyme but also at a second locus that is probably different for each agent and dictated by the chemical substituent on carbon 2. Disruption of the mitochondrial inner membrane by octyl glucoside causes inactivation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I while releasing carnitine palmitoyltransferase II in active form. The latter is readily purified, is a smaller protein than carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, and has the same molecular weight in liver and muscle. It is insensitive to inhibitors where on or off the mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1552545242,"Preparations of the rat liver asialoglycoprotein receptor (rat hepatic lectin, RHL), which is responsible for the selective uptake of partially deglycosylated serum glycoproteins, have been found to contain multiple polypeptide species. A method has been developed for separating the predominant species (RHL-1) from the minor species (RHL-2/3) using conditions in which RHL-1 retains its galactose-binding activity. Endoglycosidase digestion and lectin blotting have been utilized to demonstrate that RHL-2 and RHL-3 differ by the presence of different carbohydrate structures attached to a common peptide backbone. Antisera specific for RHL-1 and RHL-2/3 have been prepared and utilized to analyze the results of cross-linking experiments performed on purified receptor and hepatocyte membranes. The results show that RHL-1 and RHL-2/3 polypeptides are each associated into homooligomers but are physically unlinked to each other. The structure of the RHL-2/3 polypeptide has been established by protein and cDNA sequence analysis, which reveals that this protein is homologous to RHL-1 throughout its length but contains one major insertion of 18 amino acids near its NH2 terminus. The COOH-terminal portion of the RHL-2/3 polypeptide has been demonstrated to contain a galactose-recognition domain by expression in an in vitro transcription/translation system. The results of these experiments indicate that RHL-1 and RHL-2/3 polypeptides are self-associated into two distinct molecules, each of which has galactose-binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1491017717,"Abstract We have investigated the regulation of mRNA levels for thrombospondin, a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-regulated secreted glycoprotein, in cultures of rat vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). A thrombospondin cDNA hybridizes to a single 5.5-kilobase SMC message which is greatly induced by serum or PDGF. When quiescent SMC are treated with PDGF, thrombospondin levels are induced rapidly (within 15 min) and in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of thrombospondin message levels parallels PDGF-mediated mitogenesis. PDGF-mediated increases in thrombospondin mRNA can be blocked in the presence of actinomycin D, suggesting that PDGF regulates the thrombospondin message at the level of gene transcription. In the presence of cycloheximide, PDGF super-induces the thrombospondin message. The data establish that mRNA levels for thrombospondin are regulated by PDGF in a manner similar to that of c-myc, c-fos, and other growth-regulatory gene products and extend our previous findings that thrombospondin secretion by SMC is dependent on exposure to PDGF. These observations are strongly suggestive of an important role for thrombospondin in the growth response of mesenchymal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1592955275,"Exposure of rat liver mitochondrial membranes to octyl glucoside, Triton X-100, or Tween 20 solubilized an active and tetradecylglycidyl-CoA (TG-CoA)-insensitive carnitine palmitoyltransferase (presumed to be carnitine palmitoyltransferase II). The residual membranes after octyl glucoside or Triton X-100 treatment were devoid of all transferase activity. By contrast, Tween 20-extracted membranes were still rich in transferase; this was completely blocked by TG-CoA and thus was presumed to be carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. The residual carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity disappeared from the membranes upon subsequent addition of octyl glucoside or Triton X-100 and could not be recovered in the supernatant fraction. Antibody raised against purified rat liver transferase II (Mr 80,000) recognized only this protein in immunoblots from untreated liver mitochondrial membranes containing both transferases I and II. Tween 20-extracted membranes, which contained only transferase I, did not react with the antibody. Purified transferase II from skeletal muscle (also of Mr 80,000) was readily recognized by the antiserum, suggesting antigenic similarity with the liver enzyme. These and other studies on the effects of detergents on the mitochondrial [3H]TG-CoA binding protein provide further support for the model of carnitine palmitoyltransferase proposed in the preceding paper. They suggest that: 1) carnitine palmitoyltransferases I and II in rat liver are immunologically distinct proteins; 2) transferase I is more firmly anchored into its membrane environment than transferase II; 3) association of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I with a membrane component(s) is necessary for catalytic activity. While carnitine palmitoyltransferase I is a different protein in liver and muscle, it seems likely that both tissues share the same transferase II."
https://openalex.org/W1713819860,"We have used isopycnic density gradient centrifugation to study the distribution of several rat liver microsomal enzymes of cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. All of the enzymes assayed in the pathway from lanosterol to cholesterol (lanosterol 14-demethylase, steroid 14-reductase, steroid 8-isomerase, cytochrome P-450, and cytochrome b5) are distributed in both smooth (SER) and rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The major regulatory enzyme in the pathway, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, also was found in both smooth and rough fractions, but we did not observe any associated with either plasma membrane or golgi. Since cholesterol can only be synthesized in the presence of these requisite enzymes, we conclude that the intracellular site of cholesterol biosynthesis is the endoplasmic reticulum. This is consistent with the long-held hypothesis. When the overall pathway was assayed by the conversion of mevalonic acid to non-saponifiable lipids (including cholesterol), the pattern of distribution obtained in density gradients verified its general endoplasmic reticulum localization. The enzyme acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase which removes free cholesterol from the membrane by esterification, was found only in the rough fraction of endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, when the RER was degranulated by the addition of EDTA, the activity of acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase not only shifted to the density of SER but was stimulated approximately 3-fold. The localization of these enzymes coupled with the stimulatory effect of degranulation on acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase activity has led us to speculate that the accumulation of free cholesterol in the RER membrane might be a driving factor in the conversion of RER to SER."
https://openalex.org/W1556927657,"Antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides corresponding to the N-terminal (residues 1-15) and the C-terminal (residues 477-492) regions of the human erythrocyte glucose transporter. The antisera recognized the intact transporter in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and Western blots. In addition, the anti-C-terminal peptide antibodies were demonstrated, by competitive ELISA and by immunoadsorption experiments, to bind to the native transporter. Competitive ELISA, using intact erythrocytes, unsealed erythrocyte membranes, or membrane vesicles of known sidedness as competing antigen, showed that these antibodies bound only to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, indicating that the C terminus of the protein is exposed to the cytoplasm. On Western blots, the anti-N-terminal peptide antiserum labeled the glycosylated tryptic fragment of the transporter, of apparent Mr = 23,000-42,000, showing that this originates from the N-terminal half of the protein. The anti-C-terminal peptide antiserum labeled higher Mr precursors of the Mr = 18,000 tryptic fragment, although not the fragment itself, indicating that the latter, with its associated cytochalasin B binding site, is derived from the C-terminal half of the protein. Antiserum against the intact transporter recognized the C-terminal peptide on ELISA, and the Mr = 18,000 fragment but not the glycosylated tryptic fragment on Western blots."
https://openalex.org/W1630124633,"Phorbol esters have been shown to cause degradation and synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. The present studies measure effects of another class of protein kinase C activators, the 1,2-diacylglycerols, on phosphatidylcholine metabolism using GH3 rat pituitary cells. 1,2-Dioctanoylglycerol (diC8, 200 micrograms/ml) reduced phosphatidylcholine levels to 95 and 70% of control by 5 min and 1 h, respectively, in cells labeled to equilibrium with [3H]choline. Concomitantly, lysophosphatidylcholine increased 3.5-fold by 15 min and remained elevated for 1 h. Glycerol 3-phosphocholine, the product of sequential deacylation of phosphatidylcholine, increased 5-fold in the medium over 1 h. DiC8 also increased the levels of unesterified arachidonic and stearic acids. Arachidonic acid was preferentially released from the 2-position of phosphatidylcholine to form lysophosphatidylcholine. These results suggest that diC8 stimulates a phospholipase A2. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol produced similar effects. In contrast, phorbol esters failed to enhance degradation in these cells. 1,2-Diacylglycerols and phorbol esters, however, stimulated phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the CDP-choline pathway. This was measured as concentration-dependent incorporation of 32Pi and [3H]choline into phosphatidylcholine in short-term labeling studies. The effects of maximal concentrations of diC8 and the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, were additive. Furthermore, in cells down-modulated for phorbol ester action, diC8-induced degradation and synthesis were unchanged. These studies demonstrate that phorbol esters and 1,2-diacylglycerols have different effects on phosphatidylcholine metabolism and suggest that 1,2-diacylglycerols may stimulate phosphatidylcholine metabolism via a pathway independent of the protein kinase C which mediates phorbol ester action. This represents the first description of a biochemical pathway activated by 1,2-diacylglycerols and not by phorbol esters."
https://openalex.org/W1578851062,"Recent results using proteases suggest that dexamethasone 21-mesylate (Dex-Mes) labeling of the rat hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cell glucocorticoid receptor occurs at one or a few closely grouped cysteine residues (Simons, S.S., Jr. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9669-9675). In this study, a more direct approach was used both to establish that only one cysteine is labeled by [3H]Dex-Mes and to identify the amino acid sequence containing this labeled cysteine. Various analytical procedures did not provide the purification of the extremely hydrophobic Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion fragment that is required for unique amino acid sequencing data. Therefore, Edman degradation was performed on the limit protease digest mixtures which appeared to contain only one 3H-labeled peptide. These degradation experiments revealed the number of amino acid residues between the NH2 terminus of each peptide and the [3H]Dex-Mes-labeled cysteine. A comparison of these amino acid spacings with the published amino acid sequence of the HTC cell glucocorticoid receptor (Miesfeld, R., Rusconi, S., Godowski, P. J., Maler, B. A., Okret, S., Wikstom, A-C., Gustafsson, J-A., and Yamamoto, K. R. (1986) Cell 46, 389-399) indicated that the one cysteine labeled by [3H]Dex-Mes is Cys-656. Further analysis of the receptor sequence for the presence of the observed grouping of proteolytic cleavage sites, but without any preconditions as to which amino acid was labeled, gave Asp-122 and Cys-656 as the only two possibilities. Potential labeling of Asp-122 could be eliminated on the basis of immunological and genetic evidence. We, therefore, conclude that the single Dex-Mes-labeled site of the HTC cell glucocorticoid receptor has been identified as Cys-656. Since several lines of evidence indicate that [3H]Dex-Mes labeling of the receptor occurs in the steroid binding site, Cys-656 is the first amino acid which can be directly associated with a particular property of the glucocorticoid receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1516690887,"Abstract To test structural and mechanistic proposals about bacteriorhodopsin, a series of analogues with single amino acid substitutions has been studied. Mutants in the proposed helix F of bacteriorhodopsin were chosen for investigation because of the probable interaction of this part of the protein with the retinal chromophore. Seven mutants of the bacteriorhodopsin gene were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, and the gene products were expressed in Escherichia coli. The resulting mutant proteins were purified and assayed for their ability to interact with retinal in phospholipid/detergent micelles to form a bacteriorhodopsin-like chromophore. Four mutants, Ser-183----Ala, Tyr-185----Phe, Ser-193----Ala, and Glu-194----Gln, bound retinal to give pigments with absorption maxima approximately the same as the wild type. Three mutant opsins bound retinal to give chromophores that were blue-shifted relative to the wild type. Two Trp----Phe substitutions at positions 182 and 189 gave absorption maxima of 480 and 524 nm, respectively, and the mutant Pro-186----Leu gave a pigment with an absorption maximum of 470 nm. However, none of the amino acid substitutions eliminated the ability of the mutant bacteriorhodopsin to pump protons in response to illumination."

Surfactant preparations which are highly effective in treating respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants lack the 35-kDa proteins, but contain the 6-kDa proteins. We isolated and partially sequenced one of these low molecular weight proteins from the lung lavage material of an alveolar proteinosis patient. Oligonucleotides deduced from the sequence were used as probes to isolate a human cDNA clone. The clone codes for a 42-kDa protein which contains the sequence of the 6-kDa protein. Messenger RNA coding for the 42-kDa protein was identified in human lung RNA by in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation of the translation products with an antiserum against purified bovine surfactant 6-kDa proteins. Immunoprecipitation of the 42-kDa primary translation product is inhibited by the presence of the bovine 6-kDa protein. These observations suggest a precursor-product relationship of the 42-kDa protein to one of the 6-kDa proteins."

We postulate that the acts as a mediator of pancreatic enzyme secretion in response to dietary protein intake and that it (designated as monitor peptide from its role in the intestine) could be responsible for the feedback regulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion. About 20 nmol of the highly purified were obtained from 800 ml of rat pancreatic juice by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. It was then sequenced. The comprises 61 amino acid residues (Table I). It has a sequence that closely resembles that of a highly conserved region in pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitors (PSTIs, Kazal type inhibitor): -Ile-Tyr-Asx-Pro-Val-Cys-Gly-Thr-Asx-Gly-. However, the is less related to other mammalian PSTIs than they are to each other. The additional 5 residues at the NH2 terminus make the larger than the common 56-residue PSTIs. The trypsin-sensitive cholecystokinin-releasing is to be classified as a Kazal-type inhibitor and may be one of the rat PSTIs or a related peptide. The present results and increasing evidence from other laboratories and ours suggest that Kazal-type inhibitors play previously unrecognized multiple physiological roles."
https://openalex.org/W1517693249,"We have developed a spinach plastid run-on transcription system to determine the extent of transcriptional regulation of chloroplast genes during morphogenetic changes of the organelle. In contrast to transcription in a spinach chloroplast extract, which requires initiation of exogenously added genes (Gruissem, W., Greenberg, B. M., Zurawski, G., and Hallick, R. B. (1983) Cell 35, 815-828), RNA synthesis in the run-on system is not affected by heparin or different salt concentrations. Transcription is asymmetric, and the size of the run-on transcripts varies between 75 nucleotides and 8 kilobases. Quantitative filter hybridization studies included gene-specific probes for the ribosomal RNA genes and nine protein-coding genes. Based on the amounts of hybridizable run-on transcripts, these genes can be ordered according to their respective transcriptional activities. The relative transcriptional activities of psbA, rbcL, and atpB in the run-on assay correlate closely with their reported promoter strengths in vitro. The plastid run-on transcription assay has been applied to determine the transcriptional regulation of plastid genes. Hybridization of run-on transcripts to regions of the spinach chloroplast genome containing at least nine tRNA genes indicates that most or all loci are highly transcribed. No significant qualitative and quantitative differences are detected when run-on transcripts from plastids of etiolated and greening cotyledons are hybridized to total, restriction enzyme-digested chloroplast DNA, demonstrating limited transcriptional regulation during chloroplast development."
https://openalex.org/W1515401522,"Calmodulin (CaM), the calcium binding protein that modulates the activity of a number of key regulatory enzymes, is present at high levels in sperm. To determine whether CaM regulates adenylate cyclase in mammalian sperm, the actions of EGTA and selected CaM antagonists on a solubilized adenylate cyclase from mature equine sperm were examined. The activity of equine sperm adenylate cyclase was inhibited by EGTA in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2 mM. Equine sperm adenylate cyclase was also inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the CaM antagonists chlorpromazine and calmidazolium (IC50 = 400 and 50 microM, respectively). The inhibition of enzyme activity by these agents correlated with their known potency and specificity as anti-CaM agents. The activity of the enzyme in the presence of 200 microM calmidazolium was restored by the addition of authentic CaM (EC50 = 15 microM); full activity was restored by the addition of 50 microM CaM. La3+, an ion that dissociates CaM from tightly bound CaM-enzyme systems, inhibited equine sperm adenylate cyclase (IC50 = 1 mM). Incubation of equine sperm adenylate cyclase with La3+ dissociated endogenous CaM from the enzyme so that most of the enzyme bound to a CaM-Sepharose column equilibrated with Ca2+. Specific elution of CaM-binding proteins from the CaM-Sepharose column with EGTA yielded a CaM-depleted adenylate cyclase fraction that was stimulated 2-fold by the addition of exogenous CaM."
https://openalex.org/W1584791707,"Four peptides capable of forming an amphipathic alpha-helix have been synthesized and their conformational and lipid-binding properties studied. These peptides have been designed to vary the alpha-helix-forming potential as well as the charge distribution of the model peptide. The resulting peptide analogs and their complexes with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine were studied by using right angle light scattering, negative stain electron microscopy, nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. The four analogs, [Glu4,9, Leu11,17] (reverse-18A, [Glu4,9, Leu5,11,17] reverse-18A, [Glu1,8, Leu11,17] 18A, and [Glu1,8, Leu5,11,17] 18A were derived from a model amphipathic peptide Asp-Trp-Leu-Lys-Ala-Phe-Tyr-Asp-Lys-Val-Ala-Glu-Lys-Leu-Lys-Glu-Ala-Phe (18A) whose lipid-associating properties strongly mimic apolipoprotein A-I or derived from Lys-Trp-Leu-Asp-Ala-Phe-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Val-Ala-Lys-Glu-Leu-Glu-Lys-Ala-Phe (reverse-18A), a peptide with little affinity for lipid and having a reversed charge distribution compared to the 18A peptide. We have shown that by substituting glutamic acid and leucine for aspartic acid and alanine, respectively, in a weak lipid-associating amphipathic helix peptide, the lipid-associating ability can be increased. Thus, peptides with both kinds of charge distribution can associate with the lipid. The ability of the peptide to disrupt phospholipid bilayers, however, is higher for 18A analogs compared to the reverse-18A analogs even after increasing the helix-forming potential and hydrophobicity. In addition to forming smaller lipoprotein particles, the modified 18A analogs were much superior to the modified reverse-18A analogs in their ability to activate the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. This demonstrates that the positions of charged residues in the amphipathic helix play an important role in lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1563945962,"Cholesterol sulfate inhibits (K1/2, 6 microM) the side chain cleavage of exogenous cholesterol in intact rat adrenal mitochondria. Inhibition is at a site other than cytochrome P-450scc: the spin state of the hemoprotein is not perturbed, and its activity is unaffected as judged by the failure to inhibit the metabolism both of 25-hydroxycholesterol and of endogenous cholesterol in a mitochondrial In contrast, 25-hydroxycholesterol, known to interact with the cytochrome, prevented the cleavage of both endogenous and exogenous cholesterol and produced the expected optical changes in the hemoprotein. Inhibition was specific, since a variety of related compounds including pregnenolone sulfate were not effective. Metabolic conversion to other species was insufficient to account for inhibition, indicating that cholesterol sulfate is the effective molecule. A hallmark of an inhibitor of a transport system is that disruption of the barrier to transport eliminates inhibition. Sonic disruption of mitochondria abated by 70% the effect of cholesterol sulfate, but did not affect inhibition by 25-hydroxycholesterol. Thus, the cholesterol sulfate appears to inhibit an intramitochondrial cholesterol translocation system that functions to move cholesterol into a steroidogenic pool. The high content of cholesterol sulfate in adrenal cortex (Drayer, N.M., Roberts, K.D., Bandi, L., and Lieberman, S. (1964) J. Biol. Chem. 239, 3112-3114) suggests a possible regulatory role for this molecule."

In addition, a DNA clone complementary to aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase mRNA was isolated by immunological screening of a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library. We have used these antibodies and cDNA probes for biochemical, immunochemical, and molecular analyses. A single form of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase is detected in rat and bovine tissue. Specifically, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase protein is biochemically and immunochemically indistinguishable in brain, liver, kidney, and adrenal medulla.

https://openalex.org/W1594007807,"Abstract Growing human choriocarcinoma BeWo b24 cells contain 1.5 X 10(6) functional cell surface transferrin binding sites and 2.0 X 10(6) intracellular binding sites. These cells rapidly accumulate iron at a rate of 360,000 iron atoms/min/cell. During iron uptake the transferrin and its receptor recycle at least each 19 min. The accumulated iron is released from the BeWo cells at a considerable rate. The time required to release 50% of previously accumulated iron into the extracellular medium is 30 h. This release process is cell line-specific as HeLa cells release very little if any iron. The release of iron by BeWo cells is stimulated by exogenous chelators such as apotransferrin, diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid, desferral, and apolactoferrin. The time required to release 50% of the previously accumulated iron into medium supplemented with chelator is 15 h. In the absence of added chelators iron is released as a low molecular weight complex, whereas in the presence of chelator the iron is found complexed to the chelator. Uptake of iron is inhibited by 250 microM primaquine or 2.5 microM monensin. However, the release of iron is not inhibited by these drugs. Intracellular iron is stored bound to ferritin. A model for the release of iron by BeWo cells and its implication for transplacental iron transport is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1501267141,"Substituted phenylacetylenes are oxidized by purified reconstituted rat liver cytochrome P-450b to the corresponding 2-arylacetic acids. A linear free energy correlation with a rho value of -2.2 exists between the rates of formation of the arylacetic acids and the substituent sigma constants. The enzyme is simultaneously inactivated but the inactivation rates, in contrast to those of metabolite formation, are essentially identical for all the phenylacetylenes. Inactivation is thus insensitive to the electronic nature of the substituents. The metabolite: inactivation ratio consequently decreases from 38 for p-methylphenylacetylene to 4 for p-nitrophenylacetylene. Replacement of the terminal proton of phenylacetylene with deuterium gives rise to an isotope effect of 1.7 on metabolite formation without altering enzyme inactivation. The differential effect of substituents on heme alkylation and metabolite formation requires the two pathways to diverge early in the catalytic process and argues against mechanisms that involve radical cation intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1556660967,"Enzyme-activated inhibitors of aromatase would result in effective medicinal agents for modulating estrogen-dependent processes and thus may be useful in controlling reproductive processes and in treating estrogen-dependent diseases such as breast and endometrial cancer. A potential enzyme-activated inhibitor of aromatase, 7 alpha-(4'-amino)phenylthio-1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione (7 alpha-APTADD), was synthesized and examined in vitro with placental aromatase. Under initial velocity conditions, 7 alpha-APTADD exhibited high affinity for the enzyme and is a potent inhibitor of aromatase with an apparent Ki of 9.9 +/- 1.0 nM and with a Km for androstenedione of 52.5 +/- 5.9 nM. This inhibitor produced a rapid time-dependent, first-order inactivation of aromatase in the presence of NADPH, while no inactivation of aromatase activity was observed in the absence of NADPH. Protection of aromatase from inactivation was observed when the substrate, androstenedione, was included in the incubation mixture containing enzyme, inhibitor, and NADPH. On the other hand, nucleophilic trapping agents such as cysteine did not protect the enzyme from inactivation by 7 alpha-APTADD. Additionally, second enzyme pulse experiments demonstrated identical rates of inactivation, suggesting that the enzyme-activated inhibitor was not being released from the active site of the enzyme. The apparent Kinact for 7 alpha-APTADD is 159 +/- 21 nM and represents the inhibitor concentration required to produce a half-maximal rate of inactivation. The half-time of inactivation at infinite inhibitor concentration was 1.38 +/- 0.92 min and is the most rapid enzyme-activated aromatase inhibitor reported to date. Thus, 7 alpha-APTADD is a potent enzyme-activated inhibitor of aromatase, exhibiting high affinity and rapid inactivation. This inhibitor will be useful in probing the biochemistry of aromatase and should also serve as an effective medicinal agent for the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1558275073,"The uptake and degradation of bovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine liver catalase, and rabbit muscle enolase have been studied in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK cells). Rates constant for the uptake of the three proteins by MPM were similar. In addition, BSA accumulation was independent of BSA concentration in the uptake medium and was not inhibited by a large excess of serum, suggesting that protein accumulation was by fluid phase pinocytosis. Following an overnight uptake, 20-30% of the accumulated protein was subsequently regurgitated into the medium in a trichloroacetic acid/phosphotungstic acid-precipitable form. This material co-migrated with the authentic protein during molecular sieve chromatography on Sephadex G-50. The rates of appearance of trichloroacetic acid/phosphotungstic acid-insoluble products were greater than expected for cell death and leakage. The observed first order rate constants, kobs, for the appearance of trichloroacetic acid/phosphotungstic acid-soluble and trichloroacetic acid/phosphotungstic acid-insoluble products in the culture medium were identical, indicating that both products were released in parallel from MPM and BHK cells. The kobs for intracellular BSA degradation and regurgitation were independent of the initial BSA concentration in the uptake medium, but were decreased about 35% when degradation was allowed to proceed in the presence of high concentrations of serum. Degradation was also inhibited by chloroquine and pepstatin. Inhibition of degradation was accompanied by an increase in the total amount of regurgitated protein appearing in the medium. Remarkably, however, these inhibitors also decreased kobs for regurgitation, thereby preserving the similarity in the observed rate constants for the appearance of trichloroacetic acid/phosphotungstic acid-soluble and trichloroacetic acid/phosphotungstic acid-insoluble products. These and other results were inconsistent with desorption of proteins from the surface of the culture dish or the surface of cells as the source of the trichloroacetic acid/phosphotungstic acid-insoluble label appearing in the medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1501839248,"The anaerobic degradation of 5-aminovalerate to valerate, acetate, propionate, and ammonia by Clostridium aminovalericum was shown to involve the following intermediates: glutaric semialdehyde, 5-hydroxyvalerate, 5-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, 4-pentenoyl-CoA, 2,4-pentadienoyl-CoA, trans-2-pentenoyl-CoA, L-3-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, 3-ketovaleryl-CoA, acetyl- and propionyl-CoA and the corresponding acylphosphates, valeryl-CoA, and possibly 3-pentenoyl-CoA. With exception of the enzyme presumably reducing 2,4-pentadienoyl-CoA to 3-pentenoyl-CoA, enzymes catalyzing the formation and utilization of the above intermediates were demonstrated in extracts. Trans-2-pentenoyl-CoA was shown to be the immediate precursor of valeryl-CoA. The reduction of 2-pentenoyl-CoA was found to be coupled to the oxidation of 4-pentenoyl-CoA to 2,4-pentadienoyl-CoA. Several enzymes catalyzing the above reactions were partially purified and some of their properties determined. A high pressure liquid chromatography method of identifying and estimating most of the above mentioned CoA thiolesters was developed."
https://openalex.org/W2106706956,"19-Norandrostenedione and androstenedione are shown to be metabolized by purified, reconstituted human placental aromatase cytochrome P-450. Kinetic evidence indicates that both steroids share a common catalytic site: 19-norandrostenedione is a competitive inhibitor of androstenedione aromatization, and the Ki value for its inhibition (120 nM) is similar to the Km value for its metabolism (132 nM). The two substrates differ, however, in their sensitivity to inhibition by the heme-iron ligand cyanide; 19-norandrostenedione is approximately 3-fold more sensitive to cyanide inhibition. Spectroscopic studies show that this differential inhibition by cyanide occurs because androstenedione competes with cyanide, whereas 19-norandrostenedione promotes cyanide binding to the heme-iron. It is proposed that these opposite effects on cyanide-iron coordination are due to the proximity of the heme-iron and C-19 of androstenedione in the enzyme-substrate complex, which results in steric exclusion of cyanide from the active site by the C-19 methyl group of androstenedione. Dioxygen is not excluded from binding to the heme-iron during catalysis, presumably because it bonds at an angle, in contrast to the linear bond of iron-cyanide complexes. A model for the active site of aromatase cytochrome P-450 is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1580151745,"Enzymatic properties of the isolated, active gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase were characterized. Kinetic parameters indicated that the gamma subunit binds the substrates MgATP and phosphorylase b as well as the holoenzyme with a Km (MgATP) of 98 microM and a Km (phosphorylase b) of 80 microM at pH 8.2, but maximal velocities are significantly lower than the holoenzyme's. Unlike the gamma-calmodulin complex, the gamma subunit activity is dependent on pH in the range of pH 6.2-9.0, with a ratio of activity at pH 6.8 to activity at pH 8.2 of 0.5-0.6. Calmodulin activates the gamma subunit more at low pH than at high pH. ADP inhibits the gamma subunit in a competitive manner with a Ki of 60 microM. Free Mg2+ stimulates gamma subunit activity 3.5-fold at both pH 6.8 and 8.2. MnATP is equivalent to MgATP as a substrate for the enzyme, but free Mn2+ inhibits gamma subunit activity. Several protein substrates of holophosphorylase kinase were found also to be phosphorylated by the gamma subunit. These included kappa-casein, myelin basic protein, the troponin complex, and troponin T alone. In the troponin complex, the proportion of 32P incorporated by the gamma subunit into troponin I compared with troponin T was not Ca2+ dependent, but with the holoenzyme, this proportion was changed greatly by Ca2+ concentration."

ATCC 31090. Molecular weight of the native form, determined by gel permeation chromatography, is 35,000 +/- 2,000. The subunit molecular weight, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is 34,000; thus, the enzyme is active as a monomer. A pI value of 4.4 is measured for the enzyme. Amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences are consistent with that predicted by the DNA sequence of the reductase gene. At 25 degrees C, pH 6.4, the turnover number is 500 min-1, and the apparent Km values for 2,5-diketo-D-gluconate and NADPH are 26 mM and 10 microM, respectively. The enzyme is specific for NADPH, but the sugar binding site will also accept 5-keto-D-fructose and dihydroxyacetone as substrates. The enzyme is active over a broad pH range (pH 5-8) for the reduction of 2,5-diketo-D-gluconate; a sharp optimum at pH 9.2 is observed for the oxidation of 2-keto-L-gulonate. A Keq value of 5.6 X 10(-13) M indicates that reduction of substrate by NADPH is highly preferred. An activation energy of 12.3 kcal mol-1 is measured. Enzyme turnover is slow relative to dehydration of the gem-diol at C-5 of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1593531443,"The specificity of protein labeling by an affinity label of glucocorticoid receptors, dexamethasone 21-mesylate (Dex-Mes), was investigated using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model. During the early stages of [3H]Dex-Mes labeling at pH 8.8, approximately 90% of the covalent bond formation occurred at the one non-oxidized cysteine (Cys-34) of BSA. The nonspecific labeling was equally distributed over the rest of the BSA molecule. [3H]Dex-Mes labeling of Cys-34 was totally, and specifically inhibited by nearly stoichiometric amounts of the thiol-specific reagent methyl methanethiolsulfonate (MMTS). Thus both Dex-Mes and MMTS appear to react very selectively with thiols under our conditions. In reactions with hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cell glucocorticoid receptors, MMTS was equally efficient in preventing [3H]dexamethasone binding to receptors and [3H]Dex-Mes labeling of the 98-kDa receptor protein. These results indicate that Dex-Mes labeling of the glucocorticoid receptor involves covalent reaction with at least one cysteine in the steroid binding site of the receptor. Small (approximately 1600-dalton) fragments of the [3H]Dex-Mes-labeled 98-kDa receptor were generated by limit proteolysis with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease under denaturing conditions. Data from these fragments on 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels were consistent with all of the covalent [3H] Dex-Mes being located on one or a few cysteines in one approximately 15-residue stretch of the receptor. Further studies revealed no differences in the limit protease digestion patterns of activated and unactivated [3H]Dex-Mes-labeled receptors with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or V8 protease under denaturing conditions. These data suggest that activation does not cause any major covalent modifications of the amino acids immediately surrounding the affinity-labeled cysteine(s) of the steroid binding site."

(1985) Science 227, 945-948), its structure in solution, particularly under physiological conditions, has not been established. We examined the conformation of troponin C under a variety of conditions by measuring the distance between sites located in the N- and C-terminal domains using the technique of resonance energy transfer. The donor was the luminescent lanthanide ion Tb3+ bound at the low affinity metal sites in the N-terminal domain. The acceptor was 4-dimethylaminophenylazophenyl-4'-maleimide attached at Cys-98 in the C-terminal domain. The distance between these sites was found to be greater than 5.2 nm at pH 5.0, 2.7 nm at pH 6.8 for uncomplexed troponin C, and 4.1 nm for troponin C complexed with troponin I at pH 6.8. These findings suggest that uncomplexed troponin C undergoes a pH-dependent transition from an elongated conformation, compatible with the crystal structure at acidic pH, to a more compact conformation at neutral pH. When complexed with troponin I, troponin C adopts a conformation of intermediate length compared to the uncomplexed molecule at pH 6.8 and 5.0."
https://openalex.org/W1553950927,"An isolation procedure for the reticulocyte heme-controlled alpha subunit of eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2 (eIF-2 alpha) kinase is described which yields different fractions with kinase activity. Each is associated with a different spectrin-related peptide as identified by anti-spectrin monoclonal antibodies. The most abundant of these peptides is the Mr 90,000 species characterized previously (Kudlicki, W., Fullilove, S., Kramer, G., and Hardesty, B. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 5332-5336). Association with the spectrin-related peptides appears to account for the heterogeneity of the enzyme during its isolation and for its highly asymmetric structure. Isolated alpha or beta spectrin subunits as well as the separated homogeneous Mr 90,000 peptide cause an increase in the initial rate of eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation that is related to a decrease in Km with little or no effect on Vmax for the phosphorylation reaction. Fractionation of highly purified eIF-2 alpha kinase preparations using affinity chromatography on monoclonal anti-spectrin antibodies has separated eIF-2 alpha kinase activity from the Mr 100,000 phosphopeptide which copurifies with the kinase during all other purification steps. A Mr 95,000 peptide, detectable only by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[alpha 32P]ATP, is shown to be distinct from the Mr 100,000 phosphopeptide and appears to be the catalytic subunit of the eIF-2 alpha kinase."

The composition of a presumptive repeating pentasaccharide unit of this glycosaminoglycan is 1 GlcNAc, 1 GalNAc, 1 Gal, 1 GalA (where GalA represents galacturonic acid), 1 3-O-methyl-GalA, and 2 SO42-. Linkage to protein of this glycoconjugate involves the hitherto unique unit Asn-GalNAc, with the N-linked asparagine residue being the second NH2-terminal amino acid and part of the common N-linked glycosyl acceptor sequence Asn-X-Thr(Ser). Transfer of the completed, sulfated glycosaminoglycan from its lipid precursor to the protein occurs at the cell surface, and the presence of this sulfated saccharide chain in the cell-surface glycoprotein seems to be required to maintain the structural integrity of the rod-shaped halobacteria. In this paper, we report the complete saccharide structure of this N-linked glycosaminoglycan. This structure is deduced from chemical analyses of fragments that were isolated after hydrazinolysis and subsequent nitrous acid deamination or after mild acidic hydrolysis of purified Pronase-derived glycosaminoglycan-peptides. The halobacterial glycosaminoglycan consists, on the average, of 10 repeating pentasaccharide units of the following structure.

https://openalex.org/W1605182467,"The kinetics of branched chain alpha-keto acid uptake and efflux were studied as a function of varied external and matrix pH. Matrix pH was determined by the distribution of 5,5'-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione. When rat heart mitochondria were incubated under transport conditions at pH 7.0 with succinate as respiratory substrate, the matrix pH was significantly greater than 8.0. Matrix pH remained greater than or equal to 8.0 when the medium pH was varied from 6.3 to 8.3, and it was lowered below 8.0 by addition of 5 mM phosphate or uncoupler. No pH gradient was detectable when mitochondria were incubated in the presence of valinomycin and uncoupler. Efflux of alpha-ketoisocaproate or alpha-ketoisovalerate from rat heart mitochondria obeyed first order kinetics. Varying the external pH from 6.6 to 8.3 had no significant effect on efflux, and at an external pH of 7.0, the first order rate constant for efflux was not affected by decreasing the matrix pH. On the other hand, exchange was sensitive to changes in medium but not matrix pH. The K0.5 for external branched chain alpha-keto acid was lowered by changing the medium pH from 7.6 to 6.3. At medium pH values greater than or equal to 8.0 both K0.5 and Vmax were affected. Uptake was determined either by measuring initial rates or was calculated after measuring the first order approach to a final equilibrium value. Unlike efflux, uptake was sensitive to changes in both external and matrix pH. The rate of branched chain alpha-keto acid uptake was stimulated by decreasing the medium pH from 8.3 to 6.3 and by alkalinization of the mitochondrial matrix. The estimated external pK for proton binding was 6.9. The data indicate that the branched chain alpha-keto acid transporter is asymmetric, that is, binding sites for substrate on the inside and outside of the mitochondrial membrane are not identical. alpha-Ketoisocaproate oxidation was measured at 37 degrees C in isolated mitochondria over the pH range of 6.6 to 8.1. Changes in the rate of branched chain alpha-keto acid oxidation, particularly when ATP was added (increase delta pH), were found to parallel the pH effects observed on branched chain alpha-keto acid uptake. Therefore, transport, and by implication oxidation, can be regulated by pH changes within the physiological range. Furthermore, intracellular pH may affect the degree of compartmentation between the cytosolic and mitochondrial branched chain alpha-keto acid pools."
https://openalex.org/W1582556327,[14C]Pyruvate was rapidly non-oxidatively decarboxylated by Ehrlich tumor mitochondria at a rate of 40 nmol/min/mg of protein in the presence or absence of ADP. A search for decarboxylation products led to significant amounts of acetoin formed when Ehrlich tumor mitochondria were incubated with 1 mM [14C] pyruvate in the presence of ATP. Added acetoin to aerobic tumor mitochondria was rapidly utilized in the presence of ATP at a rate of 65 nmol/min/mg of protein. Citrate has been found as a product of acetoin utilization and was exported from the tumor mitochondria. Acetoin has been found in the ascitic liquid of Ehrlich and AS30-D tumor-bearing animals. These unusual reactions were not observed in control rat liver mitochondria.
https://openalex.org/W1519879404,"Recently we demonstrated that target sizes for the partial activities of nitrate reductase were considerably smaller than the 100-kDa subunit which corresponded to the target size of the full (physiologic) activity NADH:nitrate reductase. These results suggested that the partial activities resided on functionally independent domains and that radiation inactivation may be due to localized rather than extensive damage to protein structure. The present study extends these observations and addresses several associated questions. Monophasic plots were observed over a wide range of radiation doses, suggesting a single activity component in each case. No apparent differences were observed over a 10-fold range of concentration for each substrate, suggesting that the observed slopes were not due to marked changes in Km values. Apparent target sizes estimated for partial activities associated with native enzyme and with limited proteolysis products of native enzyme suggested that the functional size obtained by radiation inactivation analysis is independent of the size of the polypeptide chain. The presence of free radical scavengers during irradiation reduced the apparent target size of both the physiologic and partial activities by an amount ranging from 24 to 43%, suggesting that a free radical mechanism is at least partially responsible for the inactivation. Immunoblot analysis of nitrate reductase irradiated in the presence of free radical scavengers revealed formation of distinct bands at 90, 75, and 40 kDa with increasing doses of irradiation rather than complete destruction of the polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1621140741,"Model high density lipoproteins containing human apolipoprotein A-I, cholesterol, and a variety of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) have been prepared and tested. The PCs included 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl PC (POPC) and its diether analog 1-O-hexadecyl-2-oleyl PC (POPC ether), 1,2-diphytanoyl PC (DPhPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-phytanoyl PC, and 1-phytanoyl-2-palmitoyl PC. All ester PCs were good acyl donors for the transesterification of cholesterol catalyzed by human lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase except DPhPC, which showed no reactivity. The PCs containing one phytanoyl chain donated an acyl chain to cholesterol as fast as non-branched fatty acyl chains. However, the competitive inhibition of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase by POPC ether and DPhPC was similar, and both lipids formed a macromolecular matrix that supported the reactivity of other ester PC substrates. The bulk of physicochemical properties of model high density lipoproteins composed of DPhPC were indistinguishable from those of POPC ether. These properties included 1) alpha-helical content of the apoprotein as assessed by circular dichroism, 2) microviscosity as determined from the fluorescence polarization and lifetime of the probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, 3) macromolecular weight based upon analytical gel filtration chromatography, and 4) surface polarity revealed by the fluorescence of 6-propionyl-2(dimethylamino)naphthalene. The only major difference in a physicochemical property was that the molecular surface area of DPhPC (area = 69 A2 at collapse pressure) determined by monolayer methods was 17 A2 greater than that of POPC (area = 53 A2 at collapse pressure) at all surface pressures measured. We suggest that the properties of DPhPC in being enzymatically nonreactive but a competitive inhibitor are due to its much larger size and that the active site of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase cannot bind phospholipid substrates in a catalytically productive way if they have surface areas of 70 A2 or more."
https://openalex.org/W1490451796,"Protein carboxyl methyltransferases, which catalyze transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the free carboxyl groups of acidic amino acids in proteins, can be divided into two classes based on several characteristics, such as the stoichiometry of substrate protein methylation, base stability of the incorporated methyl group, specificity for substrate, and participation in a regulatory system with which methylesterases are associated. The presence of such an enzyme in a photosynthetic system was demonstrated in the present work. The extent of methylation of chloroplast proteins was stimulated 30% by light and then decreased by the same amount in the presence of the electron transport inhibitor 3-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-1', 1'-dimethylurea or uncouplers of phosphorylation, indicating a dependence of the methyltransferase activity on photosynthetic electron transport and the trans-membrane delta pH. The light-independent, as well as the light-dependent, activity is probably of chloroplast origin since the extent of light stimulation in the purified thylakoid membranes and the stromal fraction was similar, and at low concentrations of S-adenosyl-L-methionine the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase:oxygenase was found to be the predominant substrate. The labeling pattern of chloroplast proteins and labeling of an exogenous nonchloroplast protein indicated that the methyltransferase activity was not substrate-specific, although at low concentrations of the methyl donor, the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase:oxygenase was labeled almost exclusively. Based on the low stoichiometry (less than 100 pmol/mg protein) of the methylation, its base lability, irreversibility, and the lack of substrate specificity except at very low concentrations of methyl donor, it was inferred that the chloroplast methyltransferase is best classified as a class II system that may function as part of a repair mechanism to replace racemized amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2160437891,"A cyclic nucleotide- and Ca2+-independent protein kinase has been identified and purified from pig liver to apparent homogeneity. This independent protein kinase is basically inactive but can be activated by a 4-min incubation with 0.25 mM ATP and 2 mM Mg2+. This ATP X Mg-mediated activation appears to involve an intramolecular autophosphorylation as it is independent of kinase concentration. Phosphoamino acid analysis further indicates that this intramolecular autophosphorylation/activation process is predominantly on a serine residue. The nonphosphorylated, inactive form of the kinase is extremely trypsin-labile, whereas the phosphorylated, active kinase is more resistant to trypsin, suggesting a conformational change during the activation process. Autophosphorylation/activation of the kinase is enhanced 2-fold by heparin (0.4 unit/ml) and blocked by phosphatidylserine (0.4 mg/ml). Partial dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated kinase is associated with a time-dependent decrease in the enzyme activity. This autophosphorylation-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates glycogen synthase (Km = 8 microM) at sites 2 and 3, resulting in inactivation of glycogen synthase. The results indicate that this independent kinase may represent a previously undiscovered liver multifunctional protein kinase which can be regulated by reversible phosphorylation."

S., Slaughter, C. A., and Goldstein, J. L. (1987) J Biol. Chem. 262, 1344-1351). In the current paper, we provide evidence to suggest that this 500-kDa kinase can be dissociated into two subunits, a catalytic subunit and an activator subunit, by treatment with 1 M NaCl. The catalytic subunit was purified to homogeneity (greater than 100,000-fold) using affinity chromatography on GTP-agarose plus several other chromatography steps. It had an Mr of 50,000 by gel filtration and 35,000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The catalytic subunit phosphorylated casein actively, but it phosphorylated the LDL receptor with only low affinity. The affinity for the LDL receptor was increased 10-fold (saturation at 10 nM LDL receptor) by addition of a second protein that was released from a high molecular weight 500-kDa complex by 1 M NaCl. This activator protein (Mr 120,000 by gel filtration) was extremely heat stable but was destroyed by trypsin. It appeared to be required in stoichiometric amounts with relation to the LDL receptor. It did not increase the ability of the 50-kDa subunit to phosphorylate casein nor did it activate phosphorylation of the LDL receptor or casein by classic casein kinase II. The current data raise the possibility that the specificity of the 500-kDa LDL receptor kinase is attributable to a heat-stable activator subunit that binds to the LDL receptor and thereby renders it a better substrate for the catalytic subunit of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1483353791,"Gluconeogenesis from fructose was studied in periportal and pericentral regions of the liver lobule in perfused livers from fasted, phenobarbital-treated rats. When fructose was infused in increasing concentrations from 0.25 to 4 mM, corresponding stepwise increases in glucose formation by the perfused liver were observed as expected. Rates of glucose and lactate production from 4 mM fructose were around 100 and 75 mumol/g/h, respectively. Rates of fructose uptake were around 190 mumol/g/h when 4 mM fructose was infused. 3-Mercaptopicolinate, an inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, decreased glucose formation from fructose maximally by 20% suggesting that a fraction of the lactate formed from fructose is used for glucose synthesis. A good correlation (r = 0.92) between extra oxygen consumed and glucose produced from fructose was observed. At low fructose concentrations (less than 0.5 mM), the extra oxygen uptake was much greater than could be accounted for by glucose synthesis possibly reflecting fructose 1-phosphate accumulation. Furthermore, fructose diminished ATP/ADP ratios from about 4.0 to 2.0 in periportal and pericentral regions of the liver lobule indicating that the initial phosphorylation of fructose via fructokinase occurs in both regions of the liver lobule. Basal rates of oxygen uptake measured with miniature oxygen electrodes were 2- to 3-fold higher in periportal than in pericentral regions of the liver lobule during perfusions in the anterograde direction. Infusion of fructose increased oxygen uptake by 65 mumol/g/h in periportal areas but had no effect in pericentral regions of the liver lobule indicating higher local rates of gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes located around the portal vein. When perfusion was in the retrograde direction, however, glucose was synthesized nearly exclusively from fructose in upstream, pericentral regions. Thus, gluconeogenesis from fructose is confined to oxygen-rich upstream regions of the liver lobule in the perfused liver."
https://openalex.org/W1538980553,"Factor D, a template-selective DNA polymerase-alpha stimulatory protein from mouse liver (Fry, M., Lapidot, J., and Weisman-Shomer, P. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 7549-7556) is shown here to enhance the activities of diverse DNA polymerases with a cognate template specificity. DNA synthesis catalyzed by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, avian myeloblastosis virus polymerase, and some mammalian alpha- and gamma-polymerases was increased by factor D. With every enhanced polymerase, factor D increased the rate of copying of only poly(dT) among various tested synthetic poly-deoxynucleotides. Of the natural DNA templates examined, rates of copying of sparsely primed denatured DNA and of singly primed circular phi X174 or M13 bacteriophage DNA, but not of activated DNA, were enhanced. Michaelis constants (Km) of affected templates with responsive polymerases were decreased by factor D, without alteration in maximum velocity (Vmax). By contrast, factor D increased Vmax of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate incorporation without changing Km of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate substrates. Binding of factor D to poly(dT), poly(dA).poly(dT), and DNA, but less to poly(dA), was indicated by specific retention of their complexes on a DEAE-cellulose column. That factor D does not bind to DNA polymerase-alpha or to its complex with the DNA template was demonstrated by the failure of the factor to be coprecipitated with alpha-polymerase by anti-polymerase-alpha monoclonal antibodies in either the absence or presence of various templates. Lack of binding of factor D to the polymerase molecule was also indicated by simultaneous maximum stimulation of two competing polymerases by a limiting amount of factor. These combined results suggest that the enhancement of DNA synthesis is exerted through interaction of factor D with the template. It is proposed that this association leads to a tighter binding of the polymerase to the template and facilitates DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1489887295,"A range of structurally related zwitterionic detergents, Zwittergents 3-06, 3-08, 3-10, and 3-12, and a derivative of cholic acid (Chaps) were examined for their ability to enhance the extraction of newly synthesized, intracellular proteoglycans and for their effect on the functional properties of cartilage proteoglycan. Although none of the detergents could extract greater than 4% of the intracellular proteoglycans when used alone, Zwittergents 3-10, 3-12, and Chaps proved equally as effective when used in combination with 4 M guanidine HCl extracting greater than 90% of newly synthesized proteoglycans. Rate zonal centrifugation of aggregates containing either 3H-link protein or 3H-monomer, which had been incubated with 2% (w/v) detergent indicated that none of the test detergents caused a disassembly of intact aggregates. However, both Zwittergents 3-10 and 3-12 prevented the reaggregation of components dissociated with 4 M guanidine HCl. Similar to the finding with aggregate, none of the detergents caused a disassembly of monomer-link protein complexes prepared from purified 3H-link protein and proteoglycan monomer, while Zwittergents 3-10 and 3-12 prevented their assembly from free link protein and monomer. However, monomer-link protein complexes once formed were able to associate with hyaluronic acid to form link-stable ternary complexes in the presence of all detergents tested including Zwittergents 3-10 and 3-12."
https://openalex.org/W1588689574,"A 58-kDa monomer of terminal transferase was isolated from calf thymus using a monoclonal antibody affinity column. The enzymatic activity was comparable to that of the 44-kDa alpha beta dimer isolated by conventional methods. Binding of the two enzyme forms to single-stranded DNA was monitored by fluorescence. The site size of both forms was approximately 11 +/- 2 nucleotides. Binding of the 44-kDa alpha beta dimer to polydeoxyadenosine was examined under several conditions. The cooperativity parameter increased from about 90 in the presence of Mg2+ to 300-400 in the absence of Mg2+. The observed dissociation constant of 3-5 microM was essentially independent of salt concentration, whereas the intrinsic dissociation constant decreased about 5-fold in the presence of Mg2+. The binding parameters of the 58-kDa monomer were independent of buffer composition and were similar to those of the 44-kDa alpha beta dimer in the presence of Mg2+. These results indicate that the additional 14-kDa peptide sequences present in the high molecular mass monomer form are not part of the DNA-binding site of terminal transferase."
https://openalex.org/W1563499880,"The effect of the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mn2+ on the amidolytic activity of bovine plasma activated protein C and a limited chymotryptic digestion product, des-1-41-light chain activated protein C, which lacks all of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid present in activated protein C, has been examined at 30 degrees C. In each case, the enzymic activities were dependent upon the presence of these cations, which exerted their effects primarily through influence on the kcat of the reaction. For both enzymes (E), the mechanism of the reaction was most consistent with a rapid equilibrium, random addition of substrate (S), and a single cation (A), with substrate hydrolysis occurring only with the ternary complex of S.E.A. The divalent cation site of importance was not associated with gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues and was found to be independent of the monovalent cation sites, which also function to activate the amidolytic and esterolytic activities of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1520658479,"We have investigated the sequence requirements for the cleavage-polyadenylation reaction in the human antithrombin III (ATIII) gene. A series of 5'-3' and 3'-5' deletions were produced around the AATAAA site using Bal31 nuclease. Ligation of appropriate pairs of such mutations resulted in the generation of varying sized deletions or duplications of sequences either upstream of, downstream of, or within the region encompassing the poly(A) site. Whereas a large deletion 3' to the AATAAA signal abolished cleavage and polyadenylation of ATIII transcripts, smaller deletions, all of which were subsets of the large one, did not. This indicated that the ATIII gene contains at least two independently acting poly(A)-cleavage signals 3' of AATAAA. When one of these signals was eliminated and the other was partially deleted at its 3'-end, we were able to disrupt the normal spacing between AATAAA and the cleavage site without substantially affecting the efficiency of the cleavage reaction. This suggested that the distance between AATAAA and the cleavage site is determined by the same sequence which, along with AATAAA, specifies cleavage and polyadenylation. The duplication of regions either upstream or downstream of AATAAA affected neither the efficiency nor the site of cleavage of the ATIII transcript. When a duplication included a large region containing AATAAA as well as downstream sequences, both sites were chosen for cleavage reactions. With a more delimited duplication, which included AATAAA but not the downstream cleavage signals, both sites were again used. However, two new cleavage sites were now detected. These results suggested that the distance between AATAAA sites and critical downstream cleavage-spacing sequences may also be important in determining the site of cleavage. This may in part stem from spatial constraints imposed by RNA-protein complexes which have been postulated to be critical in catalyzing the cleavage-polyadenylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1592484304,"The thymidylate synthase (TS) activity in Leishmania major resides on the bifunctional protein thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase (TS-DHFR). We have isolated, either by Sephadex G-25 chromatography or by nitrocellulose filter binding, a binary complex between the substrate deoxyuridylate (dUMP) and TS from L. major. The kinetics of support a binding mechanism in which dUMP initially binds to TS in a rapid, reversible pre-equilibrium step (Kd approximately 1 microM), followed by a slow first-order step (k = 3.5 X 10(-3) s-1) which results in the isolable complex; the rate constant for the dissociation of dUMP from this complex was 2.3 X 10(-4) s-1, and the overall dissociation constant was approximately 0.1 microM. The stoichiometry of dUMP to enzyme appears to be 1 mol of nucleotide bound/mol of dimeric TS-DHFR. Binary complexes between the stoichiometric inhibitor 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP) and TS, and between the product deoxythymidylate (dTMP) and TS were also isolated by nitrocellulose filter binding. Competition experiments indicated that each of these nucleotides were to the same site on the enzyme and that this site was the same as that occupied by the nucleotide in the FdUMP-cofactor X TS ternary complex. Thus, it appeared that the binary complexes were occupying the active site of TS. However, the preformed isolable dUMP X TS complex is neither on the catalytic path to dTMP nor did it inhibit TS activity, even though the dissociation of dUMP from this complex is several orders of magnitude slower than catalytic turnover (approximately 3 s-1). The results suggest that dUMP binds to one of the two subunits of the native protein in a catalytically incompetent form which does not inhibit activity of the other subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1601833749,"We find ethanenitronate (formula; see text) to be a H2O2- (and peracetic acid-) dependent suicide substrate for bovine liver catalase (E) which converts E to Em, a modified form of the enzyme. The catalytic and suicide pathways are related to E, Em, Compound I, and Compound II according to the following scheme. (formula; see text) The catalytic cycle generates free radical products (EN.) which then participate in an O2-dependent chain reaction. Within experimental error the exclusive target for inactivation by EN- is Compound II. This partitions in the ratio (k4 = 1.2 M-1 s-1)/(k3 = 1.6 M-1 s-1) to generate Em and E, respectively. The species Em acquires 1 eq of 14C/ferriheme from [1-14C]ethanenitronate which is firmly (presumably covalently) affixed to the protein moiety. According to the standard H2O2 assay, Em is 7% as active catalytically as E. We regard inactivation as resulting from that fraction of EN. in the E...EN. complex which fails to diffuse from the complex because it is trapped by reaction with a neighboring amino acid residue to generate Em irreversibly. (formula; see text) This mechanism is identical to that deduced previously for suicide inactivation of horseradish peroxidase by alkane nitronates (Porter, D. J. T., and Bright, H. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9913-9924) with the exception that EN. is trapped in that case by a methine carbon at the edge of the ferriheme rather than by the apoenzyme. The labeled residue in the catalase apoenzyme probably resides at or near the site of reduction of Compound II."
