https://openalex.org/W1570441204,"Incubation of tubulin with taxol resulted in the assembly of tubulin in the absence of microtubule associated proteins. Optimum assembly occurred at approximately equal concentrations of tubulin and taxol. Both podophyllotoxin and colchicine inhibited the taxol-induced tubulin polymerization. Microtubules formed with taxol were also resistant to podophyllotoxin-induced depolymerization. The rate of tubulin subunit exchange into taxol-induced microtubules at steady state was 5-fold lower than into microtubule-associated protein (MAP2)-stimulated microtubules. There was a marked difference in the kinetics of tubulin polymerized in the presence of both taxol and MAP2 as compared to that obtained with either of them alone. In binding experiments, no competition was observed between taxol and MAP2 or the anti-tubulin drugs, e.g. colchicine, podophyllotoxin, and vinblastine."
https://openalex.org/W1530132438,"Smooth muscle myosin was purified from turkey gizzards with the 20,000-dalton light chains in the unphosphorylated state. The actin-activated MgATPase activity was 4 nmol/min/mg at 25 degrees C. When the myosin was phosphorylated to 2 mol of Pi/mol of myosin using purified myosin light chain kinase, calmodulin, and ATP, the actin-activated MgATPase activity rose to 51 nmol/min/mg. Complete dephosphorylation of the same myosin by a purified phosphatase lowered the activity to 5 nmol/min/mg, and complete rephosphorylation of the myosin following inhibition of the phosphatase raised it again to 46 nmol/min/mg. Human platelet myosin could be substituted for turkey gizzard myosin, with similar results. A chymotryptic fragment of smooth muscle myosin which retains the phosphorylated site on the 20,000-dalton light chain of myosin was prepared. Using the same scheme for reversible phosphorylation, this smooth muscle heavy meromyosin was found to show the same positive correlation between phosphorylation of the myosin light chain and the actin-activated MgATPase activity. The results with smooth muscle heavy meromyosin show that the effect of phosphorylation on the actin-activated MgATPase activity can be separated from the effects of phosphorylation on myosin filament assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1519338837,"The properties of Mg2+-ATPase in the vacuole of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied, using purified intact vacuoles and right-side-out vacuolar membrane vesicles prepared by the method of Y. Ohsumi and Y. Anraku ((1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2079). The enzyme requires Mg2+ ion but not Ca2+ in. Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions inhibit the activity. The optimal pH is at pH 7.0. The enzyme hydrolyzes ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP in this order and the Km value for ATP was determined as 0.2 mM. It does not hydrolyze ADP, adenosyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, or p-nitrophenyl phosphate. ADP does not inhibit hydrolysis of ATP by the enzyme. The activities of intact vacuoles and of vacuolar membrane vesicles were stimulated 3- and 1.5-fold, respectively, by the protonophore uncoupler 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzilidenemalononitrile and the K+/H+ antiporter ionophore nigericin. Sodium azide at a concentration exerting an uncoupler effect also stimulated the activity. The activity was sensitive to the ATPase inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but not to sodium vanadate. The ATP-dependent formation of an electrochemical potential difference of protons, measured by the flow-dialysis method, was determined as 180 mV, with contribution of 1.7 pH units, interior acid, and of a membrane potential of 75 mV. It is concluded that the Mg2+-ATPase of vacuoles is a new marker enzyme for these organelles and is a N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive, H+-translocating ATPase whose catalytic site is exposed to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1591650108,"A Mg-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activated by submicromolar free Ca2+ was identified in detergent-dispersed rat liver plasma membranes after fractionation by concanavalin A-Ultrogel chromatography. Further resolution by DE-52 chromatography resulted in the separation of an activator from the enzyme. The activator, although sensitive to trypsin hydrolysis, was distinct from calmodulin for it was degraded by boiling for 2 min, and its action was not sensitive to trifluoperazine; in addition, calmodulin at concentrations ranging from 0.25 ng-25 micrograms/assay had no effect on enzyme activity. Ca2+ activation followed a cooperative mechanism (nH = 1.4), half-maximal activation occurring at 13 +/- 5 nM free Ca2+. ATP, ITP, GTP, CTP, UPT, and ADP displayed similar affinities for the enzyme; K0.5 for ATP was 21+/- 9 microM. However, the highest hydrolysis rate (20 mumol of Pi/mg of protein/10 min) was observed at 0.25 mM ATP. For all the substrates tested kinetic studies indicated that two interacting catalytic sites were involved. Half-maximal activity of the enzyme required less than 12 microM total Mg2+. This low requirement for Mg2+ of the high affinity (Ca2+-Mg2+)ATPase was probably the major kinetic difference between this activity and the nonspecific (Ca2+ or Mg2+)ATPase. In fact, definition of new assay conditions, i.e. a low ATP concentration (0.25 mM) and the absence of added Mg2+, allowed us to reveal the (Ca2+-Mg2+)ATPase activity in native rat liver plasma membranes. This enzyme belongs to the class of plasma membrane (Ca2+-Mg2+)ATPases dependent on submicromolar free Ca2+ probably responsible for extrusion of intracellular Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1544813339,"Various biosynthetic forms of porcine spleen cathepsin D (Erickson, A. H. and Blobel, G. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11771-11774), isolated by immunoprecipitation of in vivo- and in vitro-synthesized products, have been characterized by partial NH2-terminal sequence analysis. Two short lived and functionally distinct NH2-terminal sequence extensions, a sequence and a sequence, have been detected. Both sequence extensions are present in preprocathepsin D which is the primary translation product immunoprecipitated after translation of porcine spleen mRNA in a wheat germ cell-free system. Preprocathepsin D is not glycosylated and has an approximate Mr = 43,000. Its 20-residue pre sequence resembles the signal sequences of presecretory proteins in abundance of Leu residues (7 out of 20 residues). Addition of dog pancreatic microsomal vesicles to the translation system resulted in the cleavage of the pre sequence and yielded segregated and glycosylated procathepsin D (Mr = 46,000) that was indistinguishable from its in vivo-synthesized counterpart detected after pulse-labeling of cultured porcine kidney cells. Some of this in vivo-synthesized procathepsin D was secreted and persisted as such in the culture medium. The remainder was converted within a period of 15 min to 2 h to single chain cathepsin D (Mr = 44,000) by removal of a pro sequence which was estimated to be 44 residues. Its partial sequence showed considerable sequence homology to the 44-residue activation peptide of pepsinogen. It is possible, therefore, that the prosequence of procathepsin D serves as an activation peptide that keeps the enzyme inactive during intracellular transport to the lysosome. The enzymatically active single chain form of cathepsin D undergoes further cleavage into a light and a heavy chain (Mr = 15,000 and 30,000, respectively) over a period of 2-24 h after synthesis. The oligosaccharide moieties of procathepsin D and of the single chain and heavy chain forms of cathepsin D are cleaved by endoglycosidase H. Treatment of cells with tunicamycin arrests the biosynthetic pathway of cathepsin D at procathepsin D. The nonglycosylated procathepsin D is not proteolytically processed and its secretion is greatly inhibited."

This conclusion is based on the nearly equivalent loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and tetrahydrobiopterin and its initial biosynthetic enzyme, guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase, after injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the substantia nigra. The role of the hydroxylase cofactor in the regulation of dopamine synthesis is reassessed."

https://openalex.org/W1536089744,"Treatment of rats with phenobarbital (PB) leads to a substantial increase in the hepatic levels of translatable polysomal poly(A) + cytochrome P-450 mRNA. An enriched fraction of P-450 mRNA was obtained by agarose gel electrophoresis and used to prepare a cDNA probe by differential hybridization to total mRNA from control and PB-treated rats. The majority of the sequences within the probe hybridized to recombinant DNA plasmids which contained a bona fide P-450 cDNA insert identified by positive hybridization selection and in vitro translation. The cDNA probe was used to demonstrate that PB treatment leads to a 30-fold increase in polysomal P-450 mRNA, which is not due to more efficient utilization of previously existing mRNA but to the appearance of new messenger in the cytoplasm. The induction of cytoplasmic P-450 mRNA by PB was rapid, with increases detected within 3 h of PB injection and steady state levels reached in approximately 20 h. The data suggest that the increase in cytoplasmic P-450 protein levels observed after PB treatment may be totally accounted for by an enhanced rate of synthesis resulting from translation of higher cytoplasmic levels of its specific mRNA. The P-450 mRNA was almost exclusively segregated into the membrane-bound polysome compartment was expected for an mRNA coding for an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W1567369841,"Vertebrate skeletal fast-twitch muscle myosin subfragment 1 is comprised of a heavy polypeptide chain of 95,000 daltons and one alkali light chain of either 21,000 daltons (A1) or 16,500 daltons (A2). In the present study, the heavy chain of subfragment 1 has been separated from the alkali light chain under nondenaturing conditions resembling those in vivo. The heavy chain exhibits the same ATPase activity as myosin subfragment 1, indicating that the heavy chain alone contains the catalytic site for ATP hydrolysis and that the alkali light chains are nonessential for activity. The free heavy chain associates readily at 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C with free A1 or A2 to form the subfragment 1 isozymes SF1(A1) or SF1(A2) respectively. Actin activates the MgATPase activity of the heavy chain in the same manner as occurs with the native isozyme, indicating that the heavy chain possesses the actin binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1594972985,"We have constructed and cloned in bacteria complementary DNAs derived from a transplantable rat medullary thyroid carcinoma. Using a hybridization probe encoding an anglerfish islet pre-prosomatostatin, a precursor of the tetradecapeptide somatostatin, we have identified and isolated a clone containing a 400-base pair complementary DNA encoding most of the rat carcinoma pre-prosomatostatin. The amino acid sequence of the tetradecapeptide somatostatin and of the amino-terminally extended form, somatostatin-28 was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the complementary DNA. Somatostatin-28 was found at the COOH terminus of a polypeptide of at least 80 amino acids indicating that somatostatin-28 arises by cleavage from a large precursor. The sequences of somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14 are strictly conserved between the rat and other mammals. Such conservation of these sequences indicates strong selective pressures during evolution to maintain the sequence and suggests that somatostatin-28 may serve some essential biologic functions apart from, or in addition to, the important regulatory actions of somatostatin-14. Additionally, we found a high degree of homology in the amino acid sequences of the NH2-terminal extension peptides in the anglerfish islet and the rat carcinoma pre-prosomatostatins pointing further to a possible biologic function of these extension peptides."

Dye was rapidly transferred from the injected cell to neighboring islet cells without specificity with regard to the immunocytochemical identity of either the donor or the recipient cells. The transfer of dye between the islet cells (types A, B, and D) demonstrates homologous and heterologous cell coupling in a system where the normal proportions and relationships of the cell types are maintained."
https://openalex.org/W2108447036,"13C NMR of isotopically enriched metabolites has been used to study the metabolism of Microbacterium ammoniaphilum, a bacterium which excretes large quantities of L-glutamic acid into the medium. Biosynthesis from 90% [1-13C]glucose results in relatively high specificity of the label, with [2,4-13C2]glutamate as the major product. The predominant biosynthetic pathway for synthesis of glutamate from glucose was determined to be the Embden Meyerhof glycolytic pathway followed by P-enolpyruvate carboxylase and the first third of the Krebs cycle. Different metabolic pathways are associated with different correlations in the enrichment of the carbons, reflected in the spectrum as different 13C-13C scalar multiplet intensities. Hence, intensity and 13C-13C multiplet analysis allows quantitation of the pathways involved. Although blockage of the Krebs cycle at the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase step is the basis for the accumulation of glutamate, significant Krebs cycle activity was found in glucose grown cells, and extensive Krebs cycle activity in cells metabolizing [1-13C]acetate. In addition to the observation of the expected metabolites, the disaccharide alpha, alpha-trehalose and alpha, beta-glucosylamine were identified from the 13C NMR spectra."

https://openalex.org/W1567695110,"The mechanisms of ion movement across the apical membrane of the colon have previously been investigated only in intact tissue. To investigate these mechanisms directly, we have undertaken the isolation and characterization of the apical brush-border membrane of the rabbit descending colon. The purification protocol consists of an initial isolation of single epithelial cells after dissociation of the mucosal layer in EDTA, a high pH (8.3), low ionic strength homogenization of the cells, and differential centrifugation and separation of apical membrane from nuclei, and filamentous material on a 7.5% Percoll gradient. A 20-fold enrichment in alkaline phosphatase (an apical membrane enzyme marker) specific activity over the initial homogenate value is observed in the final membrane fraction. This fraction also contains a K+-activated, pH 7.8, optimum ATPase (20 times purified over homogenate) with the following properties: 1) low Kact (2 X 10(-4) M) for K+; 2) resistance to high ionic strength (1 M Tris) solubilization; 3) competitive inhibition by Na+ (K1 = 14 mM), no activation by Na+; 4) inhibition by orthovanadate (K1 = 40 nM), but no effect of oligomycin (20 micrograms/ml of protein) or ouabain (10(-3) M); and 5) a K+-sensitive phosphorylated intermediate. These characteristics suggest that this membrane-bound ATPase is distinct from other known ATPases including the Na+ + K+ - ATPase-Na+ pump of the basolateral membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1546475417,"The steady state GSH content of cultured mouse resident peritoneal macrophages was 34 +/- 5 pmol/microgram of cell protein. Intracellular GSH content decreased concomitantly with zymosan ingestion. The half-life of GSH decreased from 1.9 h in resting cells to 0.58 h during phagocytosis as determined by inhibition of GSH synthesis with buthionine sulfoximine. The decrease in GSH half-life was directly related to the extent of particle uptake. In cytochalasin D-treated cells, attachment of zymosan to the macrophage plasma membrane in the absence of particle interiorization was sufficient to stimulate GSH turnover. Efflux was the major route of GSH loss in [35S]cystine-labeled macrophages, and was enhanced 3-fold by a zymosan challenge. GSH was lost intact since resident macrophages lack gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (less than 1 pmol of L-gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide/microgram of protein . h). Macrophages obtained from mice challenged in vivo with Corynebacterium parvum maintained higher intracellular GSH levels (50 +/- 5 pmol/microgram of cell protein) than did resident cells. The half-life of GSH in buthionine sulfoximine-treated C. parvum-elicited macrophages was 3.8 +/- 0.2 h while resting and 1.3 +/- 0.2 h during phagocytosis. C. parvum-elicited macrophages, in contrast to resident cells, contained sufficient levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity to hydrolyze 55 pmol of L-gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide/microgram of cell protein . h. These studies indicate that phagocytosis and cellular activation have profound effects on GSH metabolism in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1978958300,"An animal model of tardive dyskinesia was used to evaluate the potential antidyskinetic properties of the neuropeptide L-prolyl-L-leucyl-glycinamide (PLG). In rats, PLG administered concurrently with the neuroleptic drug haloperidol or chlorpromazine antagonized the enhancement of specific [3H]spiroperidol binding in the striatum that is associated with long-term neuroleptic treatment. The results are discussed in relation to a possible functional coupling of the putative PLG receptor with neuroleptic-dopamine receptor complex and clinical implications for tardive dyskinesia."
https://openalex.org/W1577684015,"Rat kidney gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is an amphipathic heterodimer, anchored to the lumenal surface of brush-border membranes via the NH2-terminal portion of its heavy subunit. The Mr values of the two subunits of detergent-solubilized enzyme are approximately 51,000 (heavy) and 22,000 (light), respectively. Biosynthesis of transpeptidase was studied in renal slices incubated with L-[35S]methionine. Transpeptidase-related proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-transpeptidase antibodies. The major species seen after relatively short pulse times is a 78,000-dalton protein. Immunological characterization, kinetic, and pulse-chase studies indicate that the Mr = 78,000 species is the precursor of the two subunits of the enzyme. Like the dimeric enzyme, the Mr = 78,000 species contains both the core and the peripheral sugar, fucose, on its oligosaccharide moieties. Since, only the labeled dimeric enzyme appears in the brush-border membranes, conversion of the Mr = 78,000 species to the two subunits presumably occurs after its arrival at the Golgi but before its transport to the brush-border surface."
https://openalex.org/W2020226833,"A single application of electroconvulsive shock produced a rapid but short-lasting increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity above control values in the rat adrenal medulla and striatum. After repeated electroconvulsive shock treatment (once per day for 7 days), tyrosine hydroxylase activity increased significantly in the locus ceruleus, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, hippocampus, cerebellum, and frontal cortex and remained elevated for 4 to 8 days. Adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase activity increased 1 day after the termination of repeated electroconvulsive shock treatments and remained elevated for at least 24 days, possibly reflecting the establishment of a new and higher steady-state level of catecholamine biosynthesis in the adrenal. These findings suggest that the persistent changes in tyrosine hydroxylase activity produced by repeated electroconvulsive shock may be a factor contributing to the long-lasting antidepressant effects of this treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1665932843,"The purified plasma membrane Mg2+-dependent ATPase of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was incorporated in liposomes using a cholate-dialysis method. The ATPase activity of the incorporated enzyme was stimulated by the H+-conducting agent carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and to a much lower extent of the K+-ionophore valinomycin in the presence of potassium. The K+/H+ exchanger nigericin (plus K+) did not stimulate ATPase activity, whereas the combined addition of both nigericin plus valinomycin was strongly stimulatory. The incorporated ATPase activity was controlled by the generated electrochemical H+ gradient since only conditions which collapse both the membrane potential and the pH gradient stimulated fully the ATPase activity of the incorporated enzyme. Direct measurement of proton movement with a pH glass electrode showed a fast and transient proton entry into the proteoliposomes upon addition of MgATP in the presence of the charge-compensating cation K+ (plus valinomycin). Moreover, during the steady state ATP hydrolysis, a H+ entry was again observed when the membrane potential was collapsed upon addition of valinomycin in the presence of K+. These data demonstrate that the plasma membrane ATPase of yeast cells is involved in electrogenic H+ translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis since the purified enzyme incorporated in the liposomes is virtually free of mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase contaminant."

https://openalex.org/W1523935457,"It has been previously demonstrated that the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin II is inhibited by phosphorylation of its two heavy chains (Collins, J. H., and Korn, E. D. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8011-8014). In this paper, it is shown that a partially purified kinase preparation from Acanthamoeba catalyzes the incorporation of 3 mol of phosphate into each mole of myosin II heavy chain. Tryptic digestion of the 32P-myosin, followed by two-dimensional peptide mapping, indicates that two of the three sites phosphorylated by the kinase in vitro correspond to the two major phosphorylation sites on the myosin heavy chain in vivo. Phosphorylation of myosin II in vitro by the kinase fraction completely inhibits the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin II. Myosin II can be isolated in a highly phosphorylated, enzymatically inactive form, then dephosphorylated to an active form, and finally rephosphorylated to an inactive form. The Acanthamoeba kinase fraction catalyzes the phosphorylation of all three sites on the heavy chain of myosin II at virtually the same rate. From a comparison of the decrease in actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity with the amount of phosphate incorporated into myosin II, and from the results obtained previously by dephosphorylating myosin II (Collins, J. H., and Korn, E. D., (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8011-8014), it can be inferred that two of the sites phosphorylated in vitro act in a synergistic manner to inhibit the actin-activated myosin II Mg2+-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1553690557,"A protein kinase which phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver. The kinase was found to exist in two forms: bound to carboxylase in a complex or in a free form that is in different stages of aggregation over a wide range of molecular weights. The purification of the kinase involved first partial purification of acetyl-CoA carboxylase through polyethylene glycol precipitation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The kinase was then separated from acetyl-CoA carboxylase by Sepharose 2B chromatography. The molecular weight of the kinase subunit was 170,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The incorporation of 1 mol of phosphate/mole of carboxylase subunit caused complete inactivation of the carboxylase. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, inactivated by the kinase, can be dephosphorylated and reactivated when incubated with phosphorylase phosphatase. The Km values of the kinase for acetyl-CoA carboxylase and ATP are 90 nM and 20 microM, respectively. The kinase was found to be cyclic AMP-independent, but activated by CoA. The protein kinase can phosphorylate acetyl-CoA carboxylase, protamine, and histones, but could not act on hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase or phosphorylase b."
https://openalex.org/W1489427730,"Coupling factor B activity was measured by the stimulation of the ATP-driven NAD+ reduction by succinate or the 32Pi-ATP exchange activity of Factor B-depleted submitochondrial particles. Half-maximal coupling activity was inhibited by 30 microM cadmium, 5 microM phenylarsine oxide, or 0.3 mM arsenite-2,3-dimercaptopropanol. The inhibition was relieved by slight excess of dithiol but not by a 10-fold molar excess of 2-mercaptoethanol. Inhibition of coupling activity by phenylarsine oxide or cadmium was not due to interference in binding of Factor B to depleted particles. Isolated Factor B binds phenylarsine oxide resulting in loss of ability to stimulate depleted submitochondrial particles. The inhibition was largely overcome by dithiol but not by monothiols. The residual coupling activity of depleted submitochondrial particles was highly resistant to cadmium or arsenical. Moreover, binding of arsenical to the depleted particles per se, did not result in inhibition of Factor B-stimulated activity. Furthermore, the addition of phenylarsine oxide to H+-ATPase resulted in loss of Pi-ATP exchange and stimulation of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activities. Both effects were further potentiated by 2-mercaptoethanol and reversed by dithiols. These effects parallel uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by these inhibitors and point to Factor B as the probable component sensitive to these inhibitors."

Specific binding of [3H]dihydroergocryptine to DDT1 cells grown either in monolayer or suspension culture was reversible, saturable, and of high affinity, and the binding site demonstrated stereoselectivity. [3H]Dihydroergocryptine dissociation constants of 1.4 +/- 0.2 nM and 1.4 +/- 0.3 nM were observed for suspension and monolayer cells, respectively. However, the concentration of binding sites in suspension-cultured cells (65,100 +/- 8,300 sites/cell) was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) than that found in monolayer cells (27,900 +/- 4,300 sites/cell). The order of agonist competition for the binding site was epinephrine (Ki = 0.92 +/- 0.32 microM) greater than or equal to norepinephrine (Ki = 2.2 +/- 1.0 microM) greater than isoproterenol (Ki = 137 +/- 17 microM), consistent with an alpha-adrenergic interaction. Results of competition experiments with specific antagonists prazosin (alpha 1-selective) or yohimbine (alpha 2-selective) and a computer modeling technique indicated that the alpha-adrenergic receptor of the DDT1 cell was predominantly (greater than 95%) the alpha 1-subtype."
https://openalex.org/W1520506457,"Avidin affinity chromatography was used to rapidly purify acetyl-CoA carboxylase to homogeneity in high yield from chicken liver. Dissociation of the purified carboxylase with dodecyl sulfate yielded a single size class of subunit polypeptide of 225,000 daltons. A steady state kinetic analysis of the carboxylase-catalyzed carboxylation of acetyl-CoA gave rise to intersecting line patterns in all double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity with each substrate pair, i.e. ATP . Mg and HCO3(-) and acetyl-CoA. It was concluded that the kinetic mechanism involves a quaternary complex of the enzyme, ADP, Pi, and acetyl-CoA rather than a double displacement as previously believed. The ordered addition of ATP, HCO3(-), and then acetyl-CoA, to the citrate-activated form of the carboxylase is the kinetic mechanism most consistent with the results."

Receptor binding of this derivative reached equilibrium at 30 min and was maintained at a plateau for at least 60 min. Two L-Trp8- labeled somatostatin analogues. 125I-Tyr1- and [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin, displayed less stable and lower specific uptake and higher nonspecific binding. In contrast to the rapid degradation of the L-Trp8 ligands during binding assay, 125I-Tyr1]D-Trp8]somatostatin retained more than 80% of its binding activity after 90 min of incubation with pituitary particles. Pituitary particles bound 125I-Tyr1]D-Tyr8]somatostatin with high affinity (Ka = 8.6 +/- 1.2 X 10(9) M-1) and capacity of 54.4 +/- 2.6 fmol/mg. These binding sites showed specificity for the native peptide and its active analogues, and other peptide hormones, including angiotensin II, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, vasopressin, oxytocin, substance P, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, did not inhibit tracer binding. A good correlation was observed between the binding affinities of several somatostatin analogues and their potencies as inhibitors of growth hormone release in rat pituitary cells. These findings emphasize the physiological importance of the pituitary somatostatin receptor in mediating the inhibitory action of the peptide on growth hormone release. The use of Tyr1[d-Trp8]somatostatin as a labeled ligand permits accurate determinations of the binding affinity and concentration of receptors for somatostatin in the normal pituitary gland and provides a basis for further studies of somatostatin receptor regulation and receptor-mediated cellular effects of the tetradecapeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1596345646,"The effects of adrenergic agonists on acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthesis were studied in isolated rat hepatocytes from mature rats (300 to 350 g). Norepinephrine and phenylephrine inactivate acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity and inhibit fatty acid synthesis. The effects of both norepinephrine and phenylephrine were blocked by the alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, and unaffected by the beta-receptor blocker propranolol. This inactivation was not mimicked by the beta-agonist isoproterenol. The measurable increase in cyclic AMP levels caused by norepinephrine and phenylephrine was abolished by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine and diminished by the beta-antagonist propranolol. Calcium depletion potentiated the increase in cyclic AMP levels by phenylephrine but abolished the phenylephrine inactivation of the carboxylase. The inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by phenylephrine was correlated with an increase in the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into the enzyme. Thus, catecholamines and their agonists promote phosphorylation and inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase through the alpha-adrenergic receptor, and the inactivation requires calcium."

However, an approach to linearity was obtained (Km for ATP, approximately 0.27 mM) with low concentrations of free magnesium. Many anions and anion-transport blockers significantly influenced enzyme activity. Stimulatory anions in decreasing order of potency were bisulfite greater than sulfite greater than isethionate greater than bicarbonate; Ka values were 2.5 mM for sulfite and 10.8 mM for bicarbonate. Acetate, borate, chloride, citrate, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, nitrite, oxalate, 1,3-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, and sulfate were without major effect. Inhibitory anions in decreasing potency order were azide greater than thiocyanate greater than fluoride greater than nitrate. Anionic stimulation of the granule membrane Mg2+-ATPase linearized the Lineweaver-Burk plots by shifting the enzyme to its higher Km state. In addition, sulfite competitively reversed the produce inhibition exerted by ADP. Anion transport-blockers inhibited the enzyme; of those tested, the most potent was 4-acetamido-4-isothiocyano-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, with a Ki of 0.17 mM; pyridoxal phosphate, sulfisoxazole, and ethacrynic acid also inhibited enzyme activity. The protein-binding dye p-sulfobenzene-azo-o-sulfobenzene-azo-beta-naphthol-3,6-disulfonic acid, structurally similar to transport blockers, was a potent inhibitor, with a Ki of 2.8 mM. These data on pituitary secretory granule ATPase raise the possibility that the granule membranes may function in anion or proton transport, perhaps in relation to exocytosis and hormone secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1499417317,"A mixture of cysteamine and glyoxylate, proposed by Hamilton et al. to form the physiological substrate of hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase (Hamilton, G. A., Buckthal, D. J., Mortensen, R. M., and Zerby, K. W. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 2625-2629), was confirmed to act as a good substrate for the pure enzyme. As proposed by those workers, it was shown that the actual substrate is thiazolidine-2-carboxylic acid, formed from cysteamine and glyoxylate with a second order rate constant of 84 min-1 M-1 at 37 degrees C, pH 7.5. Steady state kinetic analyses reveal that thiazolidine-2-carboxylic acid is a better substrate at pH 8.5 than at pH 7.5. At both pH values, the catalytic turnover number is similar to that obtained with D-proline. D-Amino acid oxidase is rapidly reduced by thiazolidine-2-carboxylic acid to form a reduced enzyme-imino acid complex, as is typical with D-amino acid oxidase substrates. The product of oxidation was shown by NMR to be delta 2-thiazoline-2-carboxylic acid. Racemic thiazolidine-2-carboxylic acid is completely oxidized by the enzyme. The directly measured rate of isomerization of L-thiazolidine-2-carboxylic acid to the D-isomer was compared to the rate of oxidation of the L-isomer by D-amino acid oxidase. Their identity over the range of temperature from 2-30 degrees C established that the apparent activity with the L-amino acid can be explained quantitatively by the rapid, prior isomerization to D-thiazolidine-2-carboxylic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1757288280,"Potassium transport coupled to ATP hydrolysis has been reconstituted in proteoliposomes using a highly purified plasma membrane Mg2+-dependent ATPase of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The ATPase activity in the incorporated enzyme was strongly stimulated (2.2-fold) by the H+-conducting agent carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). The H+/K+ exchanger nigericin (in the presence of K+) stimulated 1.6-fold the ATPase activity. When both ionophores were added together, the stimulation was increased up to 2.7-fold. When a potassium concentration gradient (high K+ in) was applied to the proteoliposome membrane, a significant drop in the CCCP-stimulated ATPase activity was observed. Inversion of the K+ concentration gradient (high K+ out) did not decrease the stimulation by CCCP. High Na+ in also decreased the stimulation induced by CCCP in the absence but not in the presence of external K+. However, high Li+ in had no effect. Direct potassium efflux from the proteolyposomes was detected upon addition of MgATP using a selective K+ electrode. The ATP-dependent potassium efflux was abolished in CCCP and/or nigericin-pretreated proteoliposomes. However, during steady state ATP hydrolysis, a transient and small K+ efflux was observed upon addition of a CCCP pulse. I propose that the plasma membrane Mg2+-dependent ATPase in yeast cells not only carries out electrogenic H+ ejection but also drives the uptake of potassium via a voltage-sensitive gate which is closed in the absence and open in the presence of the membrane potential."

https://openalex.org/W1653768435,"The role of Mg2+ in the activation of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis has been investigated with the (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. The enzyme of the native and solubilized vesicles was phosphorylated with ATP at 0 degrees C, pH 7.0, in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. When Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the medium were chelated, phosphoenzyme hydrolysis continued for about 15 s and then ceased. The extent of this hydrolysis increased with increasing concentrations of Mg2+ added before the start of phosphorylation. This shows that the hydrolysis was activated by the Mg2+ added. The Mg2+ which activated phosphoenzyme hydrolysis was distinct from Mg2+ derived from MgATP bound to the substrate site. The Mg2+ site at which Mg2+ combined to activate phosphoenzyme hydrolysis was located on the outer surface of the vesicular membranes. During the catalytic cycle, Mg2+ combined with the Mg2+ site before Ca2+ dissociated from the Ca2+ transport site of the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme with bound Ca2+. This Mg2+ did not activate hydrolysis of the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme with bound Ca2+, but markedly activated hydrolysis of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme without bound Ca2+. It is concluded that during the catalytic cycle, Mg2+ activates phosphoenzyme hydrolysis only after Ca2+ has dissociated from the Ca2+ transport site of phosphoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1532292525,"D-Amino acid oxidase can be inactivated by covalent modification of predominantly tyrosine residue(s) at pH 7.4 by a low molar excess of fluorodinitrobenzene, which appears to act as an active site-directed reagent (Nishino, T., Massey, V., and Williams, C. H., Jr. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3610-3616). Peptide mapping by high performance liquid chromatography of tryptic digests of protein modified with radiolabeled reagent revealed two major radioactive fractions with substantially different retention times which were not observed in protein modified in the presence of benzoate, a potent competitive inhibitor. Isolation and sequence analysis of the major radiolabeled peptides, as well as other direct chemical analyses, are presented which unambiguously demonstrate that these fractions represent modification of two different regions of the protein. The majority of the radiolabel was found within a 61-amino acid residue peptide containing an O-DNP-tyrosine residue exclusively at position 17. The substantial sequence surrounding this tyrosine residue indicates that it is different from that shown to react with N-chloro-D-leucine (Ronchi, S., Galliano, M., Minchiotti, L., Curti, B., Rudie, N. G., Porter, D. J. T., and Bright, H. J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6044-6046). The second fraction consisted of a 12-residue peptide containing an epsilon-DNP-lysine residue at position 5. Together, these two modified amino acids represented 0.89 mol of DNP incorporated/protein monomer. Both modifications must contribute to inactivation to account for the 90% decrease in enzymatic activity. Evidence is presented which suggests that both groups are within the active center of the enzyme and are modified in a mutually exclusive manner."

https://openalex.org/W1483306962,"Abstract In our studies with purified soluble guanylate cyclase from rat lung, we have tested a number of guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) analogues as substrates and inhibitors, 5'-Guanylylimidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P), guanylyl (beta, gamma-methylene) diphosphate (GMP-P(CH2)P), and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) were found to be substrates for guanylate cyclase. GTP gamma S supported cyclic GMP formation at 20 or 75% of the rate seen with Mn2+-GTP and Mg2+-GTP, respectively. GMP-P(NH)P and GMP P(CH2)P supported cyclic GMP formation at 10-20% of the GTP rate with either cation cofactor. These analogues were found to have multiple Km values; one Km value was similar to GTP (150 microM with Mg2+, 20-70 microM with Mn2+), but an additional high affinity catalytic site (3 microM) was also observed. Guanosine tetraphosphate (Ki = 10 microM), adenosine triphosphate (Ki = 9 microM) and the 2'3'-dialdehyde derivative of GTP (dial GTP) (Ki = 1 microM) were not good substrates for the enzyme; however, they were potent competitive inhibitors. These GTP analogues will be useful tools for the study of GTP binding sites on guanylate cyclase and they may also help elucidate the effects of free radicals and other agents on guanylate cyclase regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1982321977,"Various lectins were found to induce tyrosine aminotransferase in H-35 rat hepatoma cells grown in monolayer culture. Wheat germ agglutinin gave a maximal induction of tyrosine aminotransferase 6 hours after its addition. The induction time course was similar to that elicited by insulin. Fourteen micrograms of wheat germ agglutinin per milliliter gave half-maximal enzyme induction and 50 micrograms per milliliter gave the maximal response. The induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by wheat germ agglutinin was additive with the induction by either dexamethasone or dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, but was not additive with the tyrosine amino transferase induction by insulin. Wheat germ agglutinin also mimicked insulin in the inhibition of cellular protein degradation in the absence of serum. The insulin-like effects of lectins should be considered in lectin-mediated manipulations such as agglutination."
https://openalex.org/W1506632686,"The K+-dependent ATPase and p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity of, and formation of phosphoenzyme by, hog parietal cell membranes were inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by the carboxyl-activating reagent, N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ). The kinetics of inactivation was pseudo first order and was similar to the EEDQ-catalyzed incorporation of [14C]glycine ethyl ester. The most likely mechanism is the EEDQ-dependent formation of inter- and intramolecular amide bonds. Cross-linking between the subunits of the ATPase occurs with EEDQ treatment. The presence of K+ on the luminal face of the enzyme is able to prevent EEDQ inhibition of K+ ATPase activity (but not intermolecular cross-linking), whereas ATP enhanced the rate of inactivation. EEDQ reaction with the enzyme therefore allows investigation of K+- and ATP-dependent states of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2117195003,"Following a freeze-thaw cycle, treatment of Escherichia coli with the nonionic detergent, Lubrol WX, renders the cells permeable to small molecules but not to cytosolic proteins. After such treatment, the permeabilized cell suspensions can be assayed directly by standard procedures both for intracellular levels of glutamine synthetase and the state of adenylylation (i.e. the average number, n, of adenylylated subunits/dodecameric molecule). Permeabilization of cells from cultures containing an adequate supply of glutamine as the sole nitrogen source led to complete retention of all protein components of the bicyclic cascade that regulates the interconversion of glutamine synthetase between adenylylated and unadenylylated forms; similar treatment of glutamine-starved cells leads to selective inactivation, only, of the uridylyltransferase. When suspended in buffers containing ATP and glutamine, the value of n in permeabilized cells increased to high values (n = 11), whereas in the presence of alpha-ketoglutarate, Pi, and ATP, the value of n decreased to approximately 2.0. Time-dependent changes in n that occur during incubations of permeabilized cells in buffers containing these effectors can be arrested either by sonication at 0-4 degrees C or by the addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (to inactivate adenylyltransferase). It is thus evident that Lubrol-treated cells may be used to investigate the regulation of glutamine synthetase adenylylation in situ."

https://openalex.org/W1532286639,"The covalently attached AMP moiety of adenylylated glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli has been replaced by its fluorescent analog, 2-aza-1,N6-etheno-AMP (aza-epsilon-AMP). The modified glutamine synthetase (aza-epsilon-GS) exhibits divalent cation requirement (Mn2+, rather than Mg2+), pH profile, Vmax, and Km similar to those of naturally adenylylated glutamine synthetase. Whereas naturally adenylylated glutamine synthetase exhibits only negligible fluorescence changes upon the binding of substrates, aza-epsilon-GS exhibits large fluorescence changes. The fluorescence changes have been used by means of a stopped flow technique to reveal the involvement of five fluorometrically distinct intermediates in the catalytic cycle for the biosynthesis of glutamine catalyzed by the adenylylated glutamine synthetase. The mechanism is very similar to that previously established for the unadenylylated enzyme, using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Substrates bind via a rapid equilibrium random mechanism, but the reaction proceeds in a stepwise manner. The formation of an enzyme-bound intermediate (probably gamma-glutamyl phosphate + ADP) from ATP and L-glutamate is the rate-limiting step, with the subsequent reaction of the enzyme-bound intermediate occurring very rapidly. The success in elucidating this complex mechanism is due largely to the vastly different amplitudes of the fluorescence changes at the two excitation maxima (300 nm and 360 nm) of the aza-epsilon-AMP moiety which accompany the formation of the various intermediates."
