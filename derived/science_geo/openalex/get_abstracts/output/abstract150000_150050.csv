The combination of a diminished stock and the possible persistence of adverse warm conditions is endangering the long-term sustainability of cod in the North Sea. To decrease the risk of collapse, fishing pressure must be reduced."

https://openalex.org/W1972778624,"Activation of telomerase, which has been frequently associated with cellular immortality, may constitute a key step in the development of human cancer. De-repression in the expression of its catalytic subunit hTERT gene has been proposed to directly link to the telomerase activation in tumor cells. Little is known about the mechanism how the hTERT gene is repressed in telomerase-negative mortal cells. This study was conducted, using an expression cloning approach, with the aim of identifying the gene(s) responsible for repressing the hTERT gene expression. Using this genetic screen, we isolated the transcription factor Mad as a repressor. Mutation of its DNA binding sites caused significant de-repression of hTERT promoter activity in mortal cells. This Mad-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter in mortal cells was counteracted by ectopic expression of Myc. The antagonism between Mad and Myc was also observed with an endogenous hTERT promoter. Their potential roles in differential hTERT promoter activities were further supported by the relative amounts of Mad and Myc proteins detected in immortal and mortal cells. Thus, Mad may be a direct negative regulator of hTERT in mortal cells and this repression mechanism can be inhibited by induction of Myc in immortal cells."

https://openalex.org/W2129387692,Melting is a familiar process not expected to show surprises: the melting of ice in a cocktail is expected to produce cooling not heating. Yet just such an effect — inverse melting — has been seen during a study of phase transitions in a polymeric system. As a result the crystalline phase appears to be more disordered than the glassy phase.

https://openalex.org/W1490702503,"The brain shows complex dynamics, due to its time-varying sensory inputs as well as its intrinsic processes at every level from ion channels to behavior. Although neural processing can be studied effectively with black-box approaches like spike decoding and information theory, to fully understand the brain we must also concern ourselves with the contents of the black box. Hugh Wilson's book Spikes, Decisions and Actions looks inside the box and outlines theoretical techniques for studying the dynamics of the neurons and neuronal networks within. Although many books describe nonlinear dynamics at a similar level, this one is unique in its exclusive reliance on examples from neuroscience."
