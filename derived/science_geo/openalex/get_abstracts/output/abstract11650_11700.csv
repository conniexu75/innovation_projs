https://openalex.org/W1992786087,"The antitumor antibiotic, adriamycin, induces severe cardiac toxicity associated with peroxidation of cardiac lipids in mice. Both this lipid peroxidation and cardiac toxicity of adriamycin are reduced by prior treatment of the animals with the free radical scavenger tocopherol. Such treatment with tocopherol does not, however, alter the magnitude or duration of the adriamycin-induced suppression of DNA synthesis in P388 ascites tumor, nor does it diminish the antitumor responsiveness of P388 ascites tumor. These results suggest that adriamycin has at least two mechanisms of tissue damage: one, which involves lipid peroxidation, is blocked by tocopherol and results in cardiac toxicity; the other, which involves binding to DNA, is not antagonized by tocopherol and is responsible for tumor response."

The sites are observed at a much greater frequency when medium 199 is used than when RPMI 1640, Ham's F10, Eagle's (basal), and CMRL 1969 are used. One site on the X chromosome is of clinical significance in that it is a marker for X-linked mental retardation."

https://openalex.org/W2000013500,"Prostaglandins are synthesized from eicosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid and eicosa-5,8,11-14-tetraenoic acid by smooth muscle cell cultures from guinea pig aorta. Production is inhibited by indomethacin. The precursor fatty acids and their prostaglandin derivatives inhibit proliferation of the cell cultures. The relative availability of fatty acids for prostaglandin biosynthesis may represent a control mechanism for cell proliferation."

Thus, this permanent line, derived originally from embryo cultures, may be composed of cells having some neural or glial characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W1976827833,"In the human being, expired ammonia concentrations from 7 to 520 micrograms per cubic meter are controlled by the last airway segment traversed by the air, and such concentrations are higher in the mouth than nose. Inspired submicrometric sulfuric acid aerosol at a mass concentration of 600 +/- 100 micrograms per cubic meter was found to be an ammonium salt with an average ammonium to sulfate molar ratio of greater than or equal to 1, when sampled within 0.5 second after exhalation."
https://openalex.org/W1982816823,"The uptake of cystine by vesicles prepared from rat kidney brush borders occurs by two distinct transport systems. The higher affinity system is inhibited by the dibasic amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine. The lower affinity system, unaffected by dibasic amino acids, appears to correspond to that observed by studying uptake of cystine by kidney slices."

https://openalex.org/W2094135028,"Cerebroventricular infusion of P-113, the blocking agent of angiotensin II, into rats for 75 minutes prior to their being allowed to drink, significantly attenuated their water intake when they had been deprived of water for 30 hours. However, a similar infusion had no effect on the food intake in rats fasted for 30 hours. The results indicate a physiological role for angiotensin II in the drinking response of rats deprived of water."
https://openalex.org/W2006912532,"Immune complexes (bovine serum albumin with rat antibodies to bovine serum albumin) formed in twofold antibody excess were injected into the duodenum of normal rats. In comparison to controls injected with antigen only, there was a marked increase in the percentage of disrupted goblet cells (an index of mucus release) in segments from the intestine of rats exposed for 3 hours to immune complexes in vivo. Similarly, there was a significant increase in 35S-labeled mucus recovered by filtration of intestinal wash, rinse, and mucosal homogenate fluids from rats exposed to immune complexes compared to those from rats exposed to bovine serum albumin or purified rat antiserum to bovine serum albumin alone. These findings suggest that certain immune complexes can stimulate mucus release from intact rat small intestine; enhanced mucus release may have a role in clearing the surface of complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1965785873,"Kittens were afforded visual experience only while wearing goggles fitted with prisms that rotated the inputs to the two eyes equally but in opposite directions about the visual axes (16° for experimental subjects, 0° for control subjects). Subsequently, receptive-field organization of the visual cortex was studied, special attention being given to the preferred orientations of binocular cells. For each group, the distribution of interocular differences in preferred orientation centered about the prism rotation experienced during early development. Thus, for moderate amounts of relative rotation, the development of interocular matching of orientation specificity in binocular cells of the visual cortex reflects the correspondence of early visual input between the two eyes."

https://openalex.org/W2128205529,THE level of the blood coagulation factors in the newborn is known to be markedly lower than that in the adult. Generally this is attributed to a lack of synthetic capacity of the liver and a deficiency in vitamin K. We describe here a re-investigation of this problem making use of recently developed methods that determine both the coagulation factors and the abnormal proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKAs). We found low coagulation factor activity in the newborn but no evidence for vitamin K deficiency. In more than half the samples a hitherto unrecognised inhibitor of blood coagulation could be demonstrated. At 3 d of age this inhibitor was found in all babies investigated. On the basis of its properties in blood coagulation tests the inhibitor could not be distinguished from heparin.

https://openalex.org/W1980570260,"Comparison of optic tract recordings in Siamese and ordinary cats reveals that Siamese cats have a significantly lower percentage of Y-cells than of X-cells. In addition, Siamese cats show depressed responses to a contrast-reversal stimulus, a result that supports the lower spatial contrast sensitivity demonstrated behaviorally by these animals. Both physiological findings suggest neurophysiological anomalies in the Siamese retina."

https://openalex.org/W1996548104,Collimated beams of 3.75 million electron volt protons were used to examine a 2-millimeter length of the root end of human hair; the concentrations of some hair root elements were correlated with the results of standard clinical assays of blood samples. The technique should be useful for the analysis of micro amounts of biological tissue.

https://openalex.org/W2086307322,"PERHAPS the most perplexing problem of biological evolution involves explanation of why diversification of life began only after 85% of the lifetime of the Earth while simple life seems to have been present for virtually all of geological time. Recent observations1–2 on the presence of complex organic species in meteoritic debris and in the interstellar medium show that some of the basic biological building blocks may have been available from the earliest times. Chamberlain and Marland3 have commented on the biological consequences of the Hargraves4 model of ocean-crust evolution while others5–6 have reassessed evidence on atmospheric evolution and indicated that changes in oxygen partial pressure may not have been critical to the diversification of life. In this note I suggest that important changes in ocean chemistry must have occurred if our current models of crustal evolution and igneous events have any validity. The evolution of complex life forms requires a high degree of environmental stability and constancy of chemical environment. It is suggested that this condition is closely linked to the spacing of major volcanic centres, and that the modern long wavelength pattern of ocean ridges and subduction zones was necessary to achieve this stability. The distribution of ophiolites or ocean-floor structures of modern type7 indicates that the present pattern may have been initiated about one billion years ago. Furthermore, large scale continental emergence4 may have been necessary to provide oceans with stable chemistry."
